"I’ve posted something similar to this after I read a book called bitcoin, the future of money by a guy called Dominic frisby. He summaries perfectly why Satoshi is an entity of several people and concludes that the leader would most likely have been Nick Szabo but he then struggles to fully commit to this statement because he was unable to find any physical code wrote by Nick which he wanted to compare to the original BTC code.",1523084396

"The hypothetical predecessor to bitcoin, bitgold, as named by Szabo, seems oddly relevant in the comparisons of bitcoin to gold today.  Szabo seems to put a lot of importance on how gold functioned as a currency, and it seems this was important to Nakamoto as well, given his chosen ""birthday"": April 5th, the date the US confiscated gold from its citizens, and 1975, the year that law was rescinded, allowing people to own gold.  Given Szabo's penchant for articles layered with currency-focuses history on unenumerated, this seems like something he'd do.",1523084095

"Best wishes with your decision.

When I went into bitcoin I set up some basic parameters for myself with a perspective of at least 2-5 years into the future, potentially 10 years depending on the development. Since I haven't invested more than I am willing to lose I would be ok if bitcoin went to zero. Yes, that's honestly true. Although, I doubt that would happen since I have confidence in my observations and judgement. I don't make a bet unless I am willing to take the risk of loss.

Personally I'd rather risk the volatility of crypto than the inevitable inflation of fiat or some of the fiat-pumped stocks. If my investments turn out to be flawed then I am willing to accept my losses, reevaluate my judgement and move on. However, if bitcoin rises over the course of time and I didn't invest based on my judgement, I would feel regret. As long as people follow their own judgement, their decisions will prove to be either correct or incorrect over time, though at least they followed their own minds with the responsibilities, risks and potentials involved.",1523083880

You do realize that mining pooling allows miners to mine a block without having most of the contents themselves, right?

&gt; There is a thing in business known as risk management. SMing is full of uncertainties, therefore by definition uncertainty = risk. That also makes it extremely unlikely from a business point of view. Mining is already too risky on its own due to price fluctuations etc for the mining pool to agree to add to that uncertainty by engaging in SM.

All of this applies even more so to 51% attacks. And yet we still believe that 51% attacks are a risk. So this argument doesn't actually reduce the extent to which the possibility of selfish mining (as opposed to the impossibility thereof) reduces security.

I strongly disapprove of all that stuff. Theymos should be ashamed to call himself a cypherpunk, and I fault the bitcoin core community for not doing more to ostracize him.

&gt; is educating people on a lot of things pertaining bitcoin

To be clear, he is _mis-educating_. That's a _negative-value_ contribution.

&gt; Moreover, you were flat wrong about negative gamma.

You and he are both misusing terms. Gamma is an input to the model, not an output. Craig himself then [tried to clarify](https://twitter.com/ProfFaustus/status/981378961677701120) that by negative gamma he meant negative probability. Well, let's look at what [negative probability is](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_probability). If you read one of the [linked papers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1008.1287.pdf), it becomes very clear that negative probability is a mathematical abstraction that can be used in cases where there is the possibility of anti-events:

&gt; Taking an event { ui } with ui ∈ Ω, we denote by N+ the number times that events with the same sign as the event ui occur during a sequence of N trials, by N- the number times that events with the opposite to the event ui sign occur during a sequence of N trials, by ni the number of times that the event ui occurs during a sequence of N trials, and by mi the number of times that the event -ui occurs during the same sequence of trials. Let vN(ui) = (ni
 )/ N+ - (mi )/ N. Then we define the extended frequency probability of the
event ui as p(ui) = lim N→∞ vN(ui)

In our case, gamma was the probability that the attacker's block comes in first, as opposed to the honest miner's block coming in first. What does an anti-event in this context even mean? An attacker's block not getting in, and also somehow magically transmuting itself into a second honest block, so as to make the honest chain instantly grow by 2?

The article seeks to rescue Craig's claim by turning it into an argument that introducing zero-power nodes has a _negative effect on gamma_, but that's not even aligned with Craig's own effort to rescue his own claim.",1523080499

"oh, i did a lot of research, and all the ""experts"" were saying it would increase in value (even more so than stocks or other investments)

so, i put money into buying BTC/ETH and LTC

it did go up a bunch for a while (I started buying last november)

but since end of December, its just gone down, down, down

i lost half of my money that i put into crypto

if i had just burned half of that money that i put into bitcoin in the fireplace i would have at least gotten something from it (it would have warmed my house a little)

as it is, i just lost a bunch of money, and everyone (the ""experts"") tells me to keep on ""hodling"" still.

of course, its the same people who told me to ""buy the dip"" (which caused me to lose even more)

anyway, i'm done with buying crypto (I have LOST way too much already)

I will hodl onto what i have, but my guess is that I'll probably lose most of that remaining value this year (as I'm thinking that, most likely, bitcoin will go down to $1-2K)",1523076634
"Honestly I think everyone who bought in before December did know this was going to happen. It literally happens after every run up. This was my first bubble and I figured maybe I was wrong about the drop when other coins started mooning even after btc and ripple had already dropped(Eth, Ven, Neo). Nope. Exactly what I thought was going to happen is exactly what happened. I'm not surprised the price dropped. I'm just surprised that I looked at the graphs and thought something different would happen this time.",1523076501

"First of all, the title of this thread is about negative gamma. Your comment that it is BS is bullshit, so you should apologise for that one to start with.

This is not my field of expertise so I don't understand everything about the impossibility of the LN network, but from what you say you fundamentally agree that LN is at least almost impossible to get done. I will trust you on your level of certainty, and I guess CSW owes you an apology (because I trust you) for taking LN's impossibility a notch up. I don't think it is a crime though, considering that **on stage you had someone that has been saying for years that big blocks/forks are dangerous and censored anyone who disagreed with him**

As for the SM model, it does work on paper indeed. I have not read CSW's papers but I know that his argument boils down to this: SM is BS. It will never happen. The paper you are referring to has deeper fallacies, for example it considers honest miners stupid and incapable of reacting. It also considers the security model of SM impeccable, as if hidden blocks have 0 chances of getting leaked. But again, I will grant you this that **CSW owes you an apology for not admitting that on paper SM is possible**. Yet, on stage you had someone who said **LN can only work with segwit**.

I also trust you on your other CSW blunders. He also owes you an apology for those blunders. Yet again, on stage you had someone who **has hijacked the bitcoin brand, the bitcoin open source project, and the bitcoin mission for a store of value project** 

So yes, Vitalik, it is true that CSW exaggerated when he spoke of LN (although his exaggeration is not so far from the truth), and that he wasn't particularly kind to the authors of the flawed selfish mining paper. He is also guilty for the technical blunders he did on twitter. He owes all those apologies to you. 

Yet, of the 2 people in that conference hall that day you did not dare to call a fraud the only fraud in that room that has defrauded millions bitcoin users. You retweeted his tweets and apparently discussed with him what to do with a person who did a couple of blunders on twitter and exaggerated the impossibility of Lightning while exposing the impossibility of selfish mining. The latter, you appear to think, is a bigger threat to bitcoin than the former.

Vitalik, you can call me a troll or shill or whatever you want, but matter of fact that day you behaved like a coward. You should be ashamed of that.",1523076306

"They would need a lot more than a simple blocksize fix hardfork to effect a U-turn from their technical dead-end mess. Firstly, any hardfork would be contentious and may result in a loss-of-control over its reference codebase (source of much of their power). It may also result in yet another coin with the same unfavourable characteristics AND sporting control over the brand/blog/newsgroup assets. Then there are the investors who bought into the cripple-bitcoin plan who would have something to say about any derailment of the... derailment. Also, RBF, various other code mods and a mountain of technical debt would/should/need to be removed. But most importantly, it would be hard for their lost merchants to return and trust them again with what amounts to another version of... Bitcoin Cash. Existing Bitcoin Cash merchants would be hard to dislodge and re-adopt your ""*Bitcoin MKII - a return to a peer-to-peer electronic cash system but this time we mean it*"" because a hardfork would be viewed as, and is, a confirmation that the blockstream/core aberration was just that, an aberration, an out of control mess with no future.",1523076089
"I like that is supports the cause. I think it is a good early effort and my next comments are just my personal ideas/opinions about possibly making future ones even better.

I realize it has to be short and to-the-point, but, I think it seems a bit cartoonish and fake. The dad looks like he needs to explode and his child knows that means he has no money. Makes dad's look bad and may make them defensive about the new tech they don't have (rather than making them wish they had it). I think a lot of children that young would not be excited by the opportunity to buy the haircut (so might not get excited by the idea of getting a crypto wallet for their phone). If dad begged or promised  them a reward in return that might make this good for encouraging child adoption. 

I have used to word child here because I think the kid is a bit young to be right for this sort of advertisement to be most effective at growing adoption. A bit more sophisticated kid would seem less offensive (to adults) in regard to his ""being smarter than his dad"" and would be more believable in regard to being willing to help the dad out of his bind (without the need to beg or negotiate).

It would be great if you could add something amazing to help the video self promote itself on Youtube (shoot for going viral). Shaving is a pretty boring online video topic. Maybe sending money to a real relative that can really use the coins for food (while surviving in a war-torn location?)? Maybe where the local currency is worth less than BCH due to constant, rampant inflation? If we are not fulfilling such use cases yet, maybe find supporters and make that happen and document it. Get national news to report on the international power of crypto to help people in need? Kinda crazy Idea: Have a super hero that is one thousand times faster than banks, more powerful than a corrupt Government and can leap all continents in a single bound.

Trying to attract merchants might be a better goal for an advert.. I bet your already working on that. That's where some of the technical advantages of Bitcoin Cash can really shine. Cheaper, faster, ...

Saw an advert from something like visa/IOS or visa/? today that showed a young man magically buying stuff by looking at the things he wanted and nodding his head to buy. They are trying to get ahead of Crypto with their magic money apps.. Sadly, blockstream and the core developers have knocked crypto back a couple years and given them a time-advantage they desperately needed to compete with BCH. Luckily, if we get our act together, we should be able to become so well adopted that they will let those fancy apps spend BCH or fiat (user's choice).

What I believe happened was, you released the coins too soon, because the only time you can cancel a zelle payment is when it hadn’t yet gone through and been finalized, or “accepted” as the representative described it. The payment hadn’t yet made it officially to your balance, and he just capitalized on your speed. This case is mostly a problem with newly enabled zelle accounts, that first use of the zelle email seems to be a point of vulnerability.

The thing that doesn't work now and which is the reason people are using altcoins instead of BTC/BCH is: slow (10 min avg.) confirmations. Fast confirmations are important for:

- trading (deposits/withdrawals)
- in-person/peer to peer exchange
- gift cards
- in-store purchases of expensive items

"Fractional Reserve Banking is the biggest theft ever created and it allowed for the banks to buy out seats in high places. We think loans are a good thing (which they can be) but fail to realise it is a scam to keep us in servitude to a highly unfair economy. They claim inflation is good for reasons like it promotes investing and movement in the economy but it's complete bullshit. It is meant to crank up prices and then by deflation buy out everything from under you and now not only do they buy what they want cheap,  they get rich off it as time passes. It's brilliant and has been copied by every country. Sometimes even to buy countries.

Bitcoin is a slightly deflationary and very new type of currency that is scary to people. They see inflation and it scares them. First on the deflationary aspect, people beleive this to be a problem for the economy (and it just very well might be they way we are set up). Thanks to inflation, it makes sense that you want to invest/spend it to keep or increase it's value and not get eaten by inflation. This puts in your head that it is like fuel for the economy. However,  there is a problem. You now hold assets, not the actual money that you use. What happens if no one is buying the asset you hold? Instantly broke. You would have to sell at an insanely low price or worse, get a *loan* to bail you out. It is proven dozens of times, we eventualy fall behind on the loan, and the economy go bust. With a somewhat deflationary currency, everyone wants to hold the currency. No matter what happens in the markets, countries don't go under since they of course held some of that currency. Prices change accordance to the economy and business are heavily affected by possible losses, but everyone's (including the businesses) money is unnafected since its value most likely just goes up to keep the economy going. Also just because we want to be hoarding our currency will not stop economic growth. Money is used for one thing and that is to be spent. Maybe not today,  maybe not this year,  but it will be spent. Sure it's possible that it will be slower economic growth but at least if things go to shit, we went bankrupt, or just in a gully, I'm sure this in itself will cause bull runs again. In a deflationary economy, when times get bad, it will be just because things need to get cheaper. I know business hates hearing this but hey, at least the currency you hold goes UP in value, your expenses are down, and you get to ride another bull run until the next gully comes along. This is just obviously terrifying to think about as an investor though, we never like hearing I could have bought it cheaper next week. Just gotta remember people literally don't stop coming up with ideas or forget they need more money to keep up their needs/wants. 

Remember if what I'm saying seems far fetched, it should because this has obviously has never been done before; A deflationary global currency. This means that anyone claiming falsehoods of a deflationary economy as a whole is bad, is also far fetched as we have never ever had one before. Gold is a close example and it's a currency that's lasted thousands of years so...  Yeah.

"I do agree long term demand and savings (hodl) in Bitcoin will increase the price. But focusing on what's happening right now,  maybe, just maybe, the price will continue to fall as fees gets lower (less miner earnings) with full Segwit adoption + Lightning adoption is about to be common (thereby temporarily scares of some % of miners to other places with their computing power). This again creates a potential, but temporary falling in prices of Bitcoin.

However, as Lightning gets more commonly adopted and used, something interesting might happen, that will increase the price continuously: Lightning demand and usage will increase demand for holding Bitcoin both for savings and for usage/availability on the Lightning network, so miners will also be coming back to Bitcoin and increase demand for it as well and make it even safer.",1523075113

also, why is there no signalling for hard-forks. Previous upgrades to bitcoin used miner signaling before the change went into the activation stage. I know miner signalling can be gamed - but it can be only gamed by MINERS and if we believe the majority of the miners are gaming such a metric we have bigger problems. 

If the next protocol upgrade used a basic voting mechanism it would be far more transparent and assuring to the rest of the community - as we trust more than 51% of the miners are honest.

What really sucks for you guys is that one of the most important pieces of information you need to at least have a fighting chance to day trade,  you don't have!  

How many coins have the exchanges lent to short sellers?   How many have been returned (shorts covered)?  How fast is the ratio between the two changing,  etc.  You need to know that if you are going to succeed as a small investor in a big pond with big (shorting) fish.

You don't know because crypto exchanges are not required to report it.   The SEC figured out a long time ago that not reporting short sales was disadvantageous to the small investor,  and they regulated it.   

I have now formed a new opinion,  BTCUSDSHORT on bitfinex (the exchange that recently stepped in major dog doo, another thread),  is an attempt to divert attention away from their short lending practices.   If a noob somehow stumbles across the concept of shorting and asks,  bitfinex has an answer , ""short interest,  ah, here's this index we cooked up,  it has the word short in it,  this IS the droid you are looking for!"".  It is not.

So ,  there is really no way to predict where things might go, everyone is flying blind.  Also keep in mind,  TA evolved 100% in the age of short sale disclosure requirements.  Applying TA to a market that is not transparent regarding short sales is probably not going to work,  IMHO.

Different strokes for different audiences. Hopefully we can continue to make more ads that serve these different purposes. ",1523073186
"&gt; You realise that blocks over 2MB have been mined on Bitcoin right?

When? You mean from this [article?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7s5o77/first_2mb_bitcoin_blocks_mined_how_does_it_work/).

 It's a 1 MB bitcoin block with extra segwit data; not a 1 MB bitcoin block - as legacy clients  don't even understand the segwit data (and Segwit was supposed to be a soft fork)

&gt; No you aren't - the funds remain in your custody - they are secured by a 2 of 2 multisig on Bitcoin and you can redeem your funds when you want.

Not really, both parties has to be online to transact. And if the other party is unresponsive - you can not close the channel (with what you believe is the current state).  See link [here](https://medium.com/@argongroup/bitcoin-lightning-network-7-things-you-should-know-604ef687af5a)

&gt;?! You know that lightning nodes are connected to other nodes right? So a connection to the one 'company' in your example means you can pay anyone else in some way connected to it. So look here: https://lnmainnet.gaben.win/ if you connect to any of those nodes you can pay any other it is indirectly connected to. You are talking about regular 'payment channels' - as proposed by Satoshi - LN is interconnected payment channels, which lets you pay other people, not just the node you are connected to.

I was giving an analogy - but it's worst. To transact using another person's node will require encumbering funds from that node. (Page 44 of the lighting whitepaper). And you can't claim your funds unless the channel is closed

&gt;The limits are to prevent the network becoming centralised. Keeping the base layer decentralised means not having things like 32MB blocks and instead scaling on additional layer like good network designs do. And you will say 'but moore's law'. That might work for some people in countries with great internet access and the money to buy high spec machines but if you want a decentralised global currency it should run on cheap equipment whilst retaining its decentralised nature.

Do lighting nodes run on cheap equipment? From the provided link https://lnmainnet.gaben.win/  do you believe sleepyark runs on a raspberry pi?
Lighting is centralizing the BTC chain

&gt;Not a central body in charge. You already mentioned SW2X. Do you know what the SW part of that was about? Segwit took many many months to be activated. If core were 'in charge' that would not have taken that long. No central body is in charge of Bitcoin - not miners (see SW2X for ref - 90% hash rate couldn't for a change), not developers (Segwit - despite massive developer support it took an age and years of debate to get it activated).

Segwit was activated through a UASF by the developers. Most big blockers were okay with it at the time as we were promised larger size blocks.
When that didn't happen - most of us left BTC.

2) He then converts to another crypto and converts to fiat.

3) He then has a problem that his wallets are now empty so he 'hacks' his blockchain and allows it to go on for hours to replace his previous coins.

I believe step 3 is possible because XVG has wraith protocol which allows for anonymous transactions.

&gt; What is Wraith Protocol?
&gt; Wraith Protocol is a technology that allows the user to seamlessly switch between public and private ledgers on the Verge Blockchain. For the first time, users are now free to choose which ledger they want to utilize.
&gt; 
&gt; To break it down, when Wraith Protocol is turned ON — t**he transaction data is hidden and not visible via the blockchain explorer**.

That last paragraph is what allows all this to happen but it there's also more that means the 'hacker' will likely never be found.

&gt; In addition, Verge provides total obfuscation of IP addresses in both cases, thanks to the most advanced version of TOR integrated in the Core Wallet. In combination with Wraith Protocol, it makes Verge the only truly untraceable cryptocurrency.

"To solve the inability to pay taxes when converting to fiat dilemma... I mean if you converted to fiat you’ve got the money right there to pay taxes. Problems come when you realize gains in crypto-crypto. What I do is this: I plan my buys, and hold. If I want DigiByte but can’t buy it, I buy Litecoin on GDAX with USD, then immediately convert to DigiByte. It’s a taxable event technically but since I did it so fast the price either didn’t move at all or only did a few cents. In taxes you can round amounts to the dollar. So no problem there. 
Just don’t buy crypto, hold for a week seeing it go up and convert it into another crypto, because you’ll realize  capital gains which are taxable. 

My strategy: buy crypto, convert to crypto of my choice instantly, hold. 

LTC purchased at $100. Sell for $100. No gain 
DGB purchased at $100. Sell for $1000. $900 gain

You can buy and hold then sell at a gain or loss but your math just won’t be as pretty. As long as you keep track of it all it doesn’t really matter in the end what strategy you use, your taxes will be the same. 

But yes holding crypto for a gain and converting to crypto realizing a gain is a problem if you don’t have fiat to pay taxes on the taxable gain. 

Hold for more than a year to realize at most 20% taxable gains. At less than a year you’re looking at a maximum of 40% income tax",1523068669

"&gt; Interesting maybe you can quote the white paper when the 1MB role is described as to create « digital gold/store of value »?

Why should I have to? At 5 sat/byte fee per standard tx there is nothing about the functionality of Bitcoin which limits it to such a role. But please make that case, I have lots of popcorn. 

&gt;Yet it is, leaving that capacity changed the characteristics of Bitcoin.

And who are you to say when the block size should be raised and by how much? Oh right! a member of the minority who does not get to dictate such changes to the majority. Live with the consensus of the Bitcoin network or create a coin of your own where the parameters are to your liking. Oh you did? Great! what are you going to call your alt coin?  

&gt;There was no block limit at all.

And now there is. So what?

&gt;It is exactly what the core team have done.

Core writes software. Implementation is up to the rest of the network participants to implement, or not.  

&gt;Censorship alone is a proof that small blocker are minority... otherwise there will be no need for it. 

Nonsense. But feel free to expound on your distinction between moderation and censorship in the context of multiple media platforms and multiple subs on reddit.  

&gt;And that chain recover the original characteristics of Bitcoin

BCH fails at even that, by your own standards. ""original"" Bitcoin should have ""no block limit at all"". Using a different different difficulty adjustment and wallet address format just underscores how un-""original"" BCH is. 

&gt;As all small blocker you only metrics of success is price, another characteristics of Ponzi schemes..

YOU brought up (-75%) price, it's YOUR argument.  

&gt;This is not soft fork detection.

If you say so. 

&gt;Well by your definition it will be bitcoin.

By consensus rules it would be Bitcoin, yes. There may or may not be a successful solution to that scenario, if it were to occur. There is no guarantee this experiment called Bitcoin cannot fail. I accept that but so far it has not happened.  

&gt;Segwit just increased block size via SF didn’t you forget already?

Not the portion allocated to tx data, do you still not comprehend the actual mechanics of this thing you loath so fervently? Good grief, this is such a waste of my time. 

&gt;Easy just hide the data to old nodes, ala segwit.

The data is not being hidden, the data is still there to validate if your node is upgraded. It's like all those pixels a movie produced in 4k resolution can display but you won't see on an old CRT monitor, those pixels are not being ""hidden"" by the producer you just need newer gear to enjoy it. Of course... I know that you know that, you just refuse to accept how broken it makes your narrative because you'd rather not accept how badly you've been mislead. 

&gt;Really? You currency just soft forked a block size increase and you say it is impossible...

I can school you but I can't make you educated. You need to do that for yourself. The details, limitations and possibilities of soft forks are well understood and explained, details of the segwit soft fork specifically are not hard to find. Likewise there is a considerable body of information online discussing technical, social, moral and ethical issues associated with hard forks. Read them, seriously read them.. or don't. It's your responsibility to understand the technology and through that understanding anticipate where things are going.      
 
&gt;No misinformation, one fork stick to the original characteristics (BCH)

Repeating that a million more times will still not make it true. 

&gt;Easy, I don’t know why you guys are so bitter about it.

The pro BTC, pro segwit, r/bitcoin community is hardly bitter, our coin is doing awesome stuff these days. This sub is the one brimming with toxicity.   

&gt;It was the the whole reason segwit was pushed so hard, « Bitcoin is fundamentaly broken » and need deep change (restricting capacity and unproven second layer solutions)

Transaction malleability was a genuine problem, what's wrong with fixing it, especially if doing so eases the creation of very powerful second layer solutions. I suppose your point here is that the ""unproven"" might not work. So what? the base layer is intact and on chain capacity is greatly improved by segwit, there is nothing stopping BTC from adding larger blocks later when needed. This argument is nothing.      

&gt;Why those who really believe in the project can’t do all they can to recover Bitcoin? It is you guys choice to change it, we tried to compromise, many times..

The people who really believe in the BTC project really feel the path we're taking is the best way forward. Did I mention that's the vast majority? Your 1 in 10 clan seems to think you're the smart 10% on the bell curve. However, if you were the bottom 10% Dunning–Kruger wouldn't tell you.

As for the ""compromise"" you (so generously offered), many times... Small blocks are a security setting. I don't want to compromise security on my coin, thanks. You see, for Bitcoin to fulfill the destiny we want it to, it will need to withstand the full force of a combined frontal assault by multiple governments, central banks and many other entities at the same time. I'm not very confident it could do so if it happened now. The network needs further hardening and it's best defense has always been decentralization. That's the priority, everything else is less important. For the sake of decentralization -this primary defense, small blocks are better than big blocks. That's all this is about. Big blocks offer more on-chain capacity, short and mid term, that keeps fees low, which in theory is good for adoption (in practice I'm not impressed). Adoption was a hot topic during 2017 when big block proponents were clutching pearls over alt coins ""gaining"" on BTC. Don't make the mistake of thinking small blockers are fools, or like high fees or don't care about adoption speed, we think those are secondary issues. We simply do not compromise on security, and because of that there is no 'good enough' when it comes to decentralization. We like your ideas, but we have our priorities.   

&gt;Somehow just after the split the narrative change again and BTC is the original Bitcoin? So broken or not?

&gt;Somehow just after the split the narrative change again and BTC is the original Bitcoin? So broken or not?

The ""original"" Bitcoin, V0.1 was *broken*, no? **That's why it was not released as V1.0** As a mater of fact, how come BCH is not a hard fork roll back to V1.0 *if it wants to present itself as the Original?* I really hope you don't give me another flippant reply to that question and you actually spend some time thinking about that and then writing a thoughtful reply. I'll give you credit for staying involved in this conversation so far, I find most people here disengage as soon as logic and facts hit the fan.    

&gt;Not without deep economics and incentives change (and with relying on unproven tech)

That's pretty much the same thing every bitcoin hater has always said about bitcoin and why they think it will fail. It's what bitcoin does.

NEO is also better than ETH. XMR is the only good one you mentioned in that list. Until you fully learn about coins you can judge, but until then you have a lot of research ahead of you.

"As I understand it, this is a possibly optional extension to existing node software, where special Tokeda-related commands are handled, and this allows both indexing of the OP_RETURN stashed data in UTX and stateless wallet access to that data.  The case is made that it is superior to meta-coins that require custom coin layer nodes running above an actual bitcoin node, because those are kind of like running a blockchain on a blockchain.

But as I read the paper, the thing I keep coming back to is that besides the node integration, there isn't that much difference between this and something like Counterparty or CoinSpark.  All require custom wallets/software for users.  All require running a bitcoin node.  You could bring either Counterparty or CoinSpark down into the bitcoin node, and have those custom clients use custom node commands to access the indexed data.  Given you can identify the subset of nodes that provide this extension for Tokeda, you can identify which provide it for whatever other token solution. 

I think it's an interesting proposal, and I think it makes a lot of good points about the cost of data, and avoiding a ""tragedy of the commons.""  However after reading it, the thing I like most about it is that it is - if viewed as an optional node extension or plugin - permission-less to support for any node that chooses to do so.  This to me is an advantage over something that modifies the protocol, like OP_GROUP.

Also, I am not sure that it is correct to claim that OP_GROUP is forever.  Much like the paper mentions that a token issuer can keep a backup of the state of their token, and reissue it elsewhere, I suspect that if one of the periodic BCH hardfork goals was to deprecate it a condition of doing so could be to transition the state to some other solution.  OP_GROUP was designed as a soft fork, and based on a NOP opcode, I also suspect that if the code was expunged and the hard fork transition to the new system was organised well enough, with clients all upgrading to use it as well - much like BCH clients like Electron Cash have to upgrade with the DAA changes, then it would require work but it wouldn't be impossible.

"Not even the most educated person will have a valuable guess. The markets can stay irrational forever. And nobody can predict the level of resistance bitcoin will encounter from the uniformed kidnappers with guns. 

Long term though, and in general, it depends on adoption mostly, and how well bitcoin is received, how quickly bitcoin is adopted, and whether or not bitcoin stays dominant. Tech improvements are largely irrelevant at this point, since we have sufficient scaling solutions to serve demand for the foreseeable future. 

Bitcoin can go very low. Below 3k, below 1k, is certainly possible if adoption doesn't pick up over the next few months, or if other negative events slow us down. It wasn't long age we were at these prices. And if the promise that attracted buyers aren't fulfilled, we're going back.",1523062411

"I agree that those altcoins would probably not even exist without Bitcoin, but I don't agree that they gain value because of Bitcoin.

First of all, most really don't have much value at all.  Long term the price of most will approach or equal zero.

I think the market phenomenon is that actually people buying and holding alt coins has put a net positive pressure on Bitcoin.  People exiting alt coins into fiat (often through bitcoin) has put a negative pressure on Bitcoin.  People trading alts see it as the other way around (bitcoin's rise pushes them higher, bitcoin drops are why they are dropping), but on a fundamental level I don't think that is what happens.

So we have a situation where there was/is a huge crypto bubble, even though Bitcoin itself is probably pretty cheap long term.  The market has been sorting that out and it has been a painful process, but a necessary one.

The article mentions that belgium ministry was robbed by replacing iban number
The stolen cash was sent to X company in poland
The cash was then transfered to C company in poland. (article says that prosecutors found connection to C company, was it a transfer of money?)
It looks like the thief, setup a company in Poland then tried to convert stolen fiat funds to bitcoin using bitfinex. When depositing to bitfinex he got ""crypto sp zoo"" company account number where he sent funds.

It appears that polish prosecutors seized ALL of funds of company X and C, instead of ONLY funds that were stolen.

But how you explain narco connections? Well it's mentioned only once in article, but the panama guy setting up hundreds of shell companies abroad might have settup'd one for the wrong people - that's why he might be connected to narcos.

However few parts of this article looks like it might be more serious and might negate above scenario.",1523062171

"**Random oracle**

In cryptography, a random oracle is an oracle (a theoretical black box) that responds to every unique query with a (truly) random response chosen uniformly from its output domain. If a query is repeated it responds the same way every time that query is submitted.

Stated differently, a random oracle is a mathematical function chosen uniformly at random, that is, a function mapping each possible query to a (fixed) random response from its output domain.

Random oracles as a mathematical abstraction were firstly used in rigorous cryptographic proofs in the 1993 publication by Mihir Bellare and Phillip Rogaway (1993).

***

**Oracle machine**

In complexity theory and computability theory, an oracle machine is an abstract machine used to study decision problems. It can be visualized as a Turing machine with a black box, called an oracle, which is able to solve certain decision problems in a single operation. The problem can be of any complexity class. Even undecidable problems, such as the halting problem, can be used.

"To further press the point that this selfish mining nonsense is only the latest thing in a pattern, it's also worth discussing Craig's other blunders. Here's him claiming that the bitcoin secp256k1 curve is pairing-compatible:

https://twitter.com/ProfFaustus/status/924242722810195968

Here's Andrew Poelstra rebutting him, and myself confirming: https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/799xlz/csw_many_wonder_why_secp256k1_was_used_in/

And here's his reply to Andrew:

https://twitter.com/ProfFaustus/status/924276066222592000

&gt; Re comments like: ""Can you clarify for us non-supercomputer-inventors how you are doing operations on 10^65-bit numbers? Because there isn't even enough storage space on earth for one of these so it sounds kinda like you're full of shit."" This is under 2^256 bits

&gt; We do calculations on 8192 bit numbers - in common RSA keys Always a question of q=what operations. It is nice to have people who are experts such as Vitalik say what is impossible... The Patent and IP lawyers love these comments :) PLEASE keep them coming! Pretty Please!

Notice how he clearly conflates ""2^256 bits"" (so much info that the entire universe isn't big enough to hold it) with ""256 bits"" (probably roughly the entropy of this sentence). This is literally the crypto equivalent of [Verizon math](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MShv_74FNWU).

Here's his argument in the tweet thread about how Bitcoin is Turing-complete:

&gt; This is something that this allows: http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2003/HPL-2003-21.pdf … Still think Bitcoin is not extensible or Turing complete... Boneh-Franklin allows for the creation of cryptographically secure Random Oracles. This is Just the start down the rabbit hole https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_oracle

&gt; And... Oracle Machines are Turing complete... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_machine …  E:y^2 = x^3 +b This is the Boneh-Franklin system - it is also Bitcoin for b = 7

I call this the ""A implies B and bee implies honey therefore A implies honey"" fallacy; just because two things have similar names doesn't mean they are remotely the same thing. An oracle machine ""is an entity capable of solving some problem, which for example may be a decision problem or a function problem""; a random oracle is simply a random number generator that stores its own past outputs so it remains consistent. The two concepts are entirely different. And this seems to be the _cornerstone_ of his argument for why bitcoin is already Turing-complete.

"The best blocksize limit is one where every transaction that happens in 10 minutes fits onto a block. This is only a limit we are talking about. Blocks will fill up and take up as much size as they need. 

My opinion as an engineer is that having a blocksize cap at all doesn’t really make much sense right now. 

In the early days of bitcoin when it was almost worthless, it would’ve been hypothetically very cheap to spam the network with transactions. Back then, the blocksize limit made sense to protect the network from what was then an inexpensive attack vector. 

Today, BTC/BCH high value makes it too expensive to attack the network with spam transactions. 

Right now, the blocksize cap only really makes sense if you want block space to be highly valuable. You would want this if you wanted to keep the cost of running a node extremely cheap in the long run. 

I personally think that both right now and in the foreseeable future, storage is so incredibly cheap that any high value placed on block space is totally artificial. Relative to other data we send in torrents over the internet everyday (pictures, videos, games, etc) the blockchain is tiny - *even* if we assume mass adoption. Let the market and miners decide the value of block space. ",1523061199

"**Cognitive dissonance**

In the field of psychology, cognitive dissonance is the mental discomfort (psychological stress) experienced by a person who simultaneously holds two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values. The occurrence of cognitive dissonance is a consequence of a person performing an action that contradicts personal beliefs, ideals, and values; and also occurs when confronted with new information that contradicts said beliefs, ideals, and values.

In A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance (1957), Leon Festinger proposed that human beings strive for internal psychological consistency in order to mentally function in the real world. A person who experiences internal inconsistency tends to become psychologically uncomfortable, and is motivated to reduce the cognitive dissonance.

He knew about things in Bitcoin that were there from launch like Wolfram 110 rules - the basis for BCH's approach to achieving light weight touring complete functionality.

A blockchain makes it possible for us to have an entirely new asset class like gold, that is completely independent of any authority or organization, that can be sent anywhere in the world directly between to parties without either of them requiring to trust eachother or anyone else. It gives people a financial freedom in ways that was never possible before, because with bitcoin's governance and security, you can trust that your money is safe and no one can ever take it away from you (ie- DAO from eth). You can argue not everything NEEDS to be as decentralized as Bitcoin because decentralization is not always efficient. But sound money/digital gold/store of value/pocket swiss bank account/financial sovereignty DOES and there’s nothing like Bitcoin. As far as I'm concerned, until today Bitcoin IS the best application of blockchain. We have 10 years of history of how effective and resilient the Bitcoin blockchain is. The other shit has yet to prove themselves, the MASTER Satoshi himself who gave us ""block chain tech"" used Bitcoin as the official application, digital gold that's also cash that can be sent anywhere peer-to-peer.

"Unfortunately it doesn’t seem possible to not require each user to run their own server, and I don’t believe anybody is even trying to find a way around that. LN is based on reactive security. If a node tries to scam you you need to online to see it. If your server isn’t online and you don’t see it your funds are stolen.

"&gt; Who ever said anything about storage? You sound like a parrot talking about the weather when the conversation is about the environment.

You mentioned storage. Neither of up mentioned the environment. Stop throwing BS in here to try and complicate it even more to distract from the fact that you have no idea what you're talking about.

&gt; Again: To sync up a node from scratch, you need to download and validate the ENTIRE blcockchain, even if you then prune it. To validate it, you need to first download it ALL.

No, you do not. Currently you do, with the shitty pruning that Core implemented. But if done right, you really won't need to.

&gt;&gt; 3.We can do 1 GB blocks today, on a consumer grade laptop.
&gt; 
&gt; No you can't. Again, points 1 and 2 above contradict this claim. Do some math and calculate the blockchain space after 1yr of consistent 1GB blocks. Do some maths instead of parroting nonsense.

Where's your math? My math says that you can process something like hundreds of 1 MB blocks a minute with Core, which is not optimized and only uses about 10% of a modern laptop processor.
 
&gt;&gt; 4.See #2 above ^
&gt; 
&gt; Yawn. More appeal to authority without any critical thinking.
&gt; 
&gt; I told you what kind of business I'll set up, and yet you do nothing to counter that. I will clutter your huge blocks, and the cheaper it is, the bigger your problem.

And you'll have to pay the fees. Hope you have thousands of dollars to just throw away.

&gt; You also don't address how on ETH it's already impossible to sync an archivial node on consumer hardware.

And that's why they're going to implement a form of pruning, and ""sharding."" Ethereum does complex contracts, that's why the fees are based more on complexity than size.

&gt; Fees will remain low.
&gt; Not discussing this... would take excessively lengthy discussions. I disagree, no free lunch, but whatever.

You're right, there is no free lunch, but there are economies of scale, and the cost of the tech, which always gets cheaper.

&gt;&gt; The world we live in today was made by people who were told ""you can't"" ""you won't"" ""not possible"" etc.
&gt; 
&gt; Isn't that EXACTLY what you're saying about the LN??? Oh, the irony.

No. The LN is a problem that purports itself to be a solution. As I've explained many times before on this sub:

&gt;BS/Core made the decision to hold back adoption in order to get the Bank-like parasitical rent-seeking LN built on top of BTC.

The problem was always BS/Core holding back adoption and usage to try and force innovation.

Satoshi actually did have an idea for payment channels, for a few small high frequency cases, just not a network of payment channels to be used instead of the Bitcoin network, he explains the purpose in this email exchange with Mike Hearn:

&gt;&gt;I haven't fully understood why sequence numbers are a property of the tx inputs rather than the tx itself.

&gt;It's for contracts.  An unrecorded open transaction can keep being replaced until nLockTime.  It may contain payments by multiple parties.  Each input owner signs their input.  For a new version to be written, each must sign a higher sequence number (see IsNewerThan).  By signing, an input owner says ""I agree to put my money in, if everyone puts their money in and the outputs are this.""  There are other options in SignatureHash such as SIGHASH_SINGLE which means ""I agree, as long as this one output (i.e. mine) is what I want, I don't care what you do with the other outputs."".  If that's written with a high nSequenceNumber, the party can bow out of the negotiation except for that one stipulation, or sign SIGHASH_NONE and bow out completely.
 
&gt;The parties could create a pre-agreed default option by creating a higher nSequenceNumber tx using OP_CHECKMULTISIG that requires a subset of parties to sign to complete the signature.  The parties hold this tx in reserve and if need be, pass it around until it has enough signatures.
 
&gt;One use of nLockTime is high frequency trades between a set of parties.  They can keep updating a tx by unanimous agreement.  The party giving money would be the first to sign the next version.  If one party stops agreeing to changes, then the last state will be recorded at nLockTime.  If desired, a default transaction can be prepared after each version so n-1 parties can push an unresponsive party out.  Intermediate transactions do not need to be broadcast.  Only the final outcome gets recorded by the network.  Just before nLockTime, the parties and a few witness nodes broadcast the highest sequence tx they saw.

https://pastebin.com/JF3USKFT

The idea of the Lightning network, in simplistic terms, is basically making a whole separate network aside from the Bitcoin network, to relay these payments and transactions in a sort of daisy-chain. But as stated by Satoshi, this is meant for contracts and ""high-frequency trades between a set of parties."" High-frequency would generally mean multiple trades per minute, and set of parties gets really complex beyond just a few. Now, the lightning network aims to create of network of the open contracts, can you not see the complexity and uselessness of telling people who only make one transaction per day to use this for every single transaction? How about the fact that the majority of people live paycheck to paycheck? They don't have the funds necessary to keep a channel open and funded for month, or even a week in most cases! Not to mention all the technical problems, the economic problems are even worse!",1523056428

Even so, people will need to jump all the hoops and face another problem: how to get Bitcoin Cash.

"You're right that the current limit on the Bitcoin Cash far exceeds it's current usage, although I wouldn't say no usage but a small amount compared to competing currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

I am not positive but increased block sizes shouldn't knock nodes offline, since they should be able to handle 32MB blocks in shorts bursts and if it was extended the cost would be substantial for the person attacking, and I'm again not sure it would cause any issues, the 8MB blocks have been tested in the past and it didn't knock any nodes offline that I know of,  this is an experiment (along with all cryptocurrencies), and I'm perfectly fine with it failing if we learn something from it. Hopefully anyone putting money into it is as well.

The network itself as far as miners are concerned are all connected mostly directly to each other (From what I understand), this attack is possible, but I think it's also possible on any POW cryptocurrency.  I am unsure if it would significantly increase the likelihood of this attack. Do you have a link to any discussion of this?

I think it is a good idea to think of any risks beforehand but sometimes you can't, sometimes it has to run so we can see the effects, this happened with Bitcoin early on and there were problems found and fixed and I still consider it experimental.  I agree we need to be somewhat cautious.  That is what the Bitcoin network has chosen to do, remain what I believe to be overly cautious, possibly to it's detriment, we'll see though.",1523054687

"I can confirm from direct personal experience, yes, the largest mining pools almost always directly peer with eachother as much as they possibly can.  This is a big portion of how the fibre network that Matt Corallo made works, from the little bit of reading I've done - Shoving blockdata between key miners as fast as possible without validating it.  (I may have the specifics wrong but that seems to be the concept).

That doesn't mean they reject connections from peers that don't produce blocks, but they certainly don't use many such connections, and none of those get onto the fibre network afaik.

Most mining pools are also running multiple bitcoin nodes in geographically distributed locations that peer both internally and externally.  I'm not sure if the software has advanced to the point where mining pools pull real time latest block data(just headers, not full block data) from multiple nodes in parallel, skipping validation, but I would be surprised if it hadn't reached that point yet.

This matches the incentives.  Honest miners absolutely must directly peer to every large miner they possibly can.  The losses from not doing so are subtle, immediate, and difficult enough to track down *without* shitty peering, nevermind with shitty peering thrown in.  Any possible cartel-like gains made from excluding miners is indirect, delayed, and difficult to formulate, not to mention politically dangerous and likely to cause a shitstorm if caught, so I'd be surprised if any miners even seriously consider not peering for as much of a direct benefit as possible.

"Very nice work, as usual, /u/jvermorel!

You articulated several important points that I believe many people miss with respect to instant transactions.  

For example, I enjoyed your comments about RBF and how miners that willingly accept bribes are essentially ""organized crime"" members.  You pointed out that this strategy obviously has higher risks than what one might think by drawing a box around the network and viewing it purely as a computer science problem.  Your commentary also sheds light on how RBF in BTC was so dangerous because it slowly modified the social contract to one where RBF was considered a helpful feature.  

I was happy to read your comment about longer block times actually being helpful for securing 0-conf transactions, as this was an unexpected result I noticed in my work on subchains preparing for SV Tokyo.  Indeed, it is looking more and more like 10 min was a wise choice for more reasons than people might have initially imagined.  

Also, your comment about larger blocks being _helpful_ for instant transactions because it forces miners to compete on propagation is something I've been pushing since [writing this paper in 2015](https://www.bitcoinunlimited.info/resources/subchains.pdf).  If blocks are very easy to propagate, all sorts of deviant strategies become possible; these strategies become less effective when timely block propagation is not trivial.  

In general, I like very much the idea of pre-consensus.  Indeed, rational miners will _want_ to remain in sync with the pre-consensus technique (whether that is Ansible, subchains, or something else) so that they minimize their orphan rates due to the faster block propagation and thus maximize their revenue.  This also has the benefit of discouraging selfish mining, as the selfish miner will likely be far out of sync with the pre-consensus.  

I need to read your section on Ansible a few more times to wrap my head around it, before I chime on on whether I like _this specific_ proposal.   Nevertheless, you're article brings up lots of interesting ideas and discussion topics!  Good work!!

Proof of work is there to confirm blocks - not individual transactions.

"
&gt; I didn't write the descriptions based on emotions, conjecture and incorrect facts. I wrote them based on what I read on hundreds of sources. Can't get much better than that in a wild market like this.

Okay I see the problem...you're incapable of basic research or differentiating facts from opinions. You could be forgiven for rushing through and just reposting opinions if you recognised what you had done, but given that you claim that ""you can't get much better than that"", you're probably a lost cause.

I won't go into all the other currency descriptions (which suffer from the same poorly written, factually incorrect biases), but focus on the Ripple one since I've already brought it up. Let's go through what you claimed you wrote ""*based on what I read on hundreds of courses*""

Your claims about Ripple:

1) ""Not a cryptocurrency""

Well, let's look at the definition of a cryptocurrency:

""A cryptocurrency (or crypto currency) is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets."" - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency

So you're either factually incorrect, or you're stating a childish opinion.

2) ""they have not published the source code""

Yes they have: https://github.com/ripple

All it takes to verify this is to type in ""Ripple Source Code"" into Google, and your first result is the link to the repository for Ripple's source code. Is there a reason you chose not to verify a single part of your description?

3) ""it isn't even clear if they have a blockchain""

It's only not clear if you didn't spend exactly 3-4 seconds to google it, and come across multiple online searchable databases showing the blockchain. Here's one for example:

https://bithomp.com/explorer/

How is it not clear, is it that you're too lazy to spend a few seconds to search it, or do you not know what a blockchain is? If the former, well that's your own problem, if the latter, a good starting point to objectively learn about blockchain is here: 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain

4) ""they are completely centralized""

You'll need to define centralised. I don't think you even know what this means. Yes, Ripple the company is the primary backer, developer and promoter of this cryptocurrency, however XRP will continue to function if Ripple disappears today. If a single entity being the driving force  is the definition of centralisation, then this also applies to the other major cryptocurrencies. 

5) ""owned by banks""

Ripple is a privately funded company. Google Ventures have put money in it, Seagate Technology has put money in it, and yes, some banks have put money into it. They don't control the company, it's seed funding. If you don't understand this, then you shouldn't talk about it. If you do understand this, not sure why you're mentioning this?

6) ""They could crash the currency one day completely by printing a massive amount of Ripple and start a new one""

 - they can't print any more...all the Ripple that can exist has been 'printed'. It's locked away and being slowly released to keep the market stable.

 - Yes they could start a new one...that's how cryptocurrencies work. That's how litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Dogecoin etc all started. Hell, that's specifically how Stellar Lumens started (started as Ripple, the creator wasn't happy with management and went and created a new one).

Basically 95% of what you wrote about Ripple is incorrect. The only vaguely factual bit of information in your ENTIRE description is that they have a tight involvement with banks.

If you cannot see from the above breakdown that you have done NO research, but merely copy-pasted opinions of others, then there's no helping you.",1523052180
"More pretzel logic. Good thing Bitcoin is immune to all that, because Bitcoin isn't a democracy. 

If the parameters that define consensus ""changed"" as you (baselessly) claim, why don't exchanges like Coinbase simply call Bitcoin Cash ""Bitcoin""?

I'll tell you why. Because misleading to your customers is a liability. Random anon talkers with can make that claim all day, but when it comes to *using* Bitcoin Cash *as Bitcoin*, it becomes impracticable or impossible. No one in their right mind, who has a responsibility to users and is subject to legal recourse, could call Bitcoin Cash ""Bitcoin"" without a very clear disclaimer. Some ""Bitcoin"". Talk is cheap, as they say. So, by all means, keep making claims. It has literally no effect, as I've already said, Bitcoin's legitimacy is determined objectively, never subjectively. Bitcoin remains Bitcoin.",1523052149

Of course you should be looking at fundamentals no matter what state the market is in but when it’s a bull market it’s very easy to just see an easy money making opportunity and forget about the stuff that underlies that price. 

I definitely view “cryptocurrency” as an asset rather than a currency. There are certain situations I could imagine in which crypto could be a full blown currency used by a significant amount of people, but can a decentralized currencies be widely adopted by citizens of a developed nation? I don’t believe so.

Flipism, sometimes written as ""Flippism,"" is a pseudophilosophy under which all decisions are made by flipping a coin. It originally appeared in the Disney comic ""Flip Decision"" by Carl Barks, published in 1953. Barks called a practitioner of ""Flipism"" a ""Flippist"" (with two P's).

Vitalitk being mad at this is justified and acceptable. It's no joke to have built ethereum and making it this huge. I would go bananas over this justin guy if I'm vitalik. But from a spectators perspective, when you are watching the whole cryptospace, its awesome to see such healthy competitive spirt from the newcomers. Being ambitious is not something we should not be frowning upon. 


Now that Tron has a testnet I'd really be happy to see some critism on the testnet and tron protocol rather than pointing fingers out on the plagarized whitepaper.


We're better than this and we're all in the very early stages i believe. So let's objectively make points and make this place less toxic so that the whole crypto market can grow and tranform our lives. I personally think this competition between tron and ethereum is real as fuck

Why do i think tron has a scope - Because they are one of the very few targeting an industry that is very succeptible to adopt and they are very focused developing things towards that objective. ( High transaction speed,  minimal fee, micro transactions). . The tech team behind looks great and they are supposed to have a good user base once they launch ( from their gazillion partnerships :P). I dont want to mention about Mr sun as people go psychotic as soon as someone mentions his name ( both positive and negative), but he has a clean track record and definitely isn't the scammy type, at least that much i believe. It's still very nascent to be thrashed upon.


Why do i think ETH is hard to beat in the recent future, not by tron but by another competitor in general -       they are one of the key reasons why crypto has grow this huge, a truly disruptive innovation and a highly credible team behind it. ( Not just talking about Vitalik here but the entire team). Just because its 25 TPS right now, it doesn't mean that it would stay so forever. With so many great minds behind it and such a strong community supporting it's definitely gonna improve and might push this space even further with future updates.

Though Tron has mentioned they would be targeting eth, i think both are focusing on huge pies of different cakes. All in all i totally love this kind of competition between these two and both look promising to me right now.

"Right now BCh isn't even experiencing the effects of 8MB blocks due to most blocks being under 100kB in size due to practically no usage . 

Thus what will happen is likely not much besides an attacker occasionally filling up 32MB blocks and knocking almost all nodes offline for fun. 

There is also a much higher probability of an attack where a mining pool or farm double spends or attacks a node with combined hashrate , large blocks , and a sybil attack . Larger blocksizes makes a sybil attack far easier to pull off because the attacker can knock off most nodes.  Keep in mind that there is a ton of hashrate out there and almost none of this is used for mining BCH . This is becoming more and more of a problem everyday because BCH keeps falling in price against btc over the last few months and is about to fall under 0.09. At this rate we might need to see BCH change its PoW algo in the future

Most users who support BCh think in terms about what is possible ignoring security risks and centralization IMHO. Designing a robust blockchain means you have to prepare for a rare attack beforehand and think of all possibilities. ",1523050170

Novogratz kept getting cnbc air time calling 50k then cancelled the opening of his crypto fund halfway thru the bubble burst. I doubt he had plans on opening the fund in the first place.

"The bank balances are just as fake as the bitcoin balances would be. In the limited example with just one depositor and one borrower, when the bank loans out the $1000 it would be impossible for person A to withdraw his money because the bank no longer has it. When he looks at his account, it says he has $1000 but in reality the bank has lent out that money.

In a more realistic example 1000 people have all deposited $1000 for a total of $1M and the bank have lent out $1000 to 900 people for a total of $900k. 1000 people can see $1000 in their account and 900 people can hold $1000 in their hand. The total is $1.9M and I suppose you could call the account balances fake if you want. Each individual can withdraw their $1000 since the bank has $100k in reserve, but it would be impossible for all 1000 people to withdraw at the same time as the bank simply doesn't have that much money.

So let's try the same thing with bitcoin:

Person A deposits 100 btc so his account balance shows 100 btc. The bank loans 100 btc to person B so he has 100 btc in hand. Person A's account balance still shows 100 btc, but he would not be able to withdraw it since the bank has lent out that money.

In a more realistic example 1000 people have all deposited 100 btc for a total of 100k btc and the bank have lent out 100 btc to 900 people for a total of 90k btc. 1000 people can see 100k btc in their account and 900 people can hold 100 btc in their own wallet. The total is 190k btc and I suppose you could call the account balances fake if you want. Each individual can withdraw their 100 btc since the bank has 10k btc in reserve, but it would be impossible for all 1000 people to withdraw at the same time as the bank simply doesn't have that much bitcoin.

BTTS is a very cool service coming to Devery and then a few tokens in the future. Bokky Poobah the developer of this tech (Famous smart contract auditor) is creating btts so that a system will automatically use pools of ETH to pay gas fees in exchange for Devery. This will creat an environment for decentralized exchanges that don't need gas for token transfers in the future and Devery will be the among the first tokens to implement this. I think this is as significant as lightning network for BTC as it will make the etherium network more convenient to use in the future. Many people are confusing BTTS with masternodes but that is simply not the case. BTTS nodes are an automated trustless service and users will NOT stake ETH to receive Devery. The node will maintain a large enough pool to handle transactions on it's own. I'm very excited for this project and the partnerships are really driving my excitement to new highs. It's gonna be a good year for the Devery team.,1523048303

If fake satoshi, and roger ver and all those other bitcoin cash believers actually cared about its future other than money why haven't they gotten more devs?? Why have they written zero BIP's or come up with a plan to address mining centralization with big blocks??",1523048103
"Your whole argument assumes business-as-usual with the current software software stack and consumer PC hardware. Of course you can't scale the blockchain using that technology - it was never designed for that.

The plan from day one was to morph Bitcoin nodes into giant data centers full of specialized hardware. Nobody expects to just install some software on a PC and try to ""sync the blockchain"" from some random peers - running a node will be a major $50k/year investment in hardware and infrastructure. Your initial ""blockchain sync"" might involve mailing hard drives from one data center to another, but that's nothing compared to the cost of building the node in the first place. Ideally, the only data you need are the block headers + UTXO set, which are vastly smaller anyhow.

Now, you might be thinking this sounds very centralizing, but it's not, really. The $50k / year cost comes from a recent talk (https://youtu.be/PKFkhWWiLDk), and is the approximate cost of running a Bitcoin node capable of supporting 50 transactions per day for all 10 billion people on the planet. To support all that economic activity, there will be thousands of different companies providing wallets, merchant services, blockchain analytics, mining, and whatever else people need. All of those businesses will be running nodes, which isn't a big deal for a business (it's less than the cost of an employee). So, even though the cost of running a node goes up, the *number* of nodes actually goes up too, and decentralization stays fine.

Of course, before you can get to 4TB blocks, you need to pass through 1GB blocks first. The current technology can *almost* do this, but there are some inefficiencies in the p2p protocol that need to be fixed first. You can see the experimental results here: https://youtu.be/5SJm2ep3X_M The Bitcoin Cash developers are actively working to solve these bottlenecks, as well as various other bottlenecks involved in storing and propagating blocks. Many talks at the recent Satoshi's Vision conference were dedicated to these topics. So, yes, we have software engineering left to do, but it's just the standard data compression / protocol optimization / parallelization stuff big companies have been doing for years.

Assuming we have everyone in the world doing 50 transactions per day, that's 3.5 billion transactions per block. Even with 1-cent fees, that's $35 million worth of fees per block. You don't need an artificial fee market to make this work!

Notice that we don't need Moore's Law here - the $50K number is based on *today's* technology. In the steady state, once the artificial block-size limits are removed, the free market will act to make to make the transaction fee equivalent to the marginal cost of processing and storing a transaction. IF the technology really can't keep up, *then* we will see fees start to rise. Trying to cap the block size before that point is just a case of central planning, which Bitcoin is designed to route around (and has in the form of Bitcoin Cash).",1523048099

"Of course, the other component of this is that market adoption of a currency is driven by the consumer, rather than the business.

IMO, bitcoin will never be adopted since centralization, despite being made out to be the evil voodoo man, is something the end user prefers. Centralization offers:

 * a buffer between the pay method and their bank balance. Someone hacks your CC, just call the credit card company and its sorted in 30 minutes.

* points - pretty self explainatory

* consumer protections including the ability dispute both fraudulent transactions and shitty businesses. For example, Aseomexico flat refused me a refund after they cancelled my flight. A centralized agency like Visa was able to call Aeromexico and batter them into giving me a refund.

 Etc etc...

I could be wrong, but I dont personally see how something decentralized like BTC can ever do the above. Until it does.... little to no reason for the consumer to switch. Frankly I think the average consumer even cares about decentralization otherwise... so there has to be something else to entice them.

Reading this thread (and so many others) depressed me. We bought bitcoin back in the day to buy and sell stuff without going through banks and paying fiat. It was cool to have digital cash and buy shit online you couldn’t buy with fiat. Silk Road etc was why we bought it-we were part of the decentralised future-buying bitcoin was anarchic-we were cyberpunks! Now it’s just about the fucking money and lambos and bullshit. We made money in December because we invested in something we believed in and got lucky but we still have bitcoin because we believe in s future not controlled by big banks and the man!

"Hi man, 

Thanks a lot for another detailed reply. I appreciate the discussion. I have done my research on Hal as well and knew about his RPOW (also spent sometime on this site (archived of course) Very interesting stuff. As you know Bitcoin would not have been viable without his work and it seems Hal and Szabo's friendship grew stronger through time. To the point that Nick makes twitter posts about missing his friend Hal on the anniversary of Hal's birthday. 

The one thing I would love for you too look into during your research, as it is still the biggest issue that I have with Szabo being Satoshi, is the programming and the lack of programming that 
 can be attributed to Szabo. If we can find anything he has programmed that would be amazing. The problem is he could have programmed a lot of things but under other Pseudonyms. We can see through old emails and posts he valued his privacy (let alone a  huge part of Cryptography is based around anonymity) and if he is Satoshi, he would have a history of using them. This would therefore lead us to believe any other major programming project would also be done under a Pseudonym. Something also to think about. 

We also can't forget about the option that Sazbo was deeply involved with bitcoin and was solely responsible for all correspondence through the Satoshi name but may have had help with programming. MAybe by Hal?

 As we have seen by Nick's email on Pseudonyms he would not email to or from himself while using his Pseudonym. Since Satoshi never had contact with Nick publicly or privately(that has been released) this makes the case stronger that SN is Nick. How would we explain the very early emails between Hal and Satoshi if Hal was helping Nick? Nick would want to try and keep Hal's anonymity as well wouldn't he? or would it not be as important as all correspondence by satoshi, which could link satoshi to Nick, where done only by Nick and therefore there was a lot less chance of people suspecting Hal?",1523047033

Currencies trade against each other, and if it wasn't that, it would be something else. And whatever could trade against something else, in a liquid way, would become the new currency.

(That something else might be bitcoin. It might be more liquid, more powerful, harder to dilute, rock solid. This should get interesting.)

That is just how things are.

"Cool idea, it's great that you already have a viable product. I can't help you directly, but I have a couple thoughts

1. you'll probably want to be responsible for maintaining and securing wallets for users on your platform, simply from an integration perspective. This is no small consideration, security is hard, because you have to be perfect all the time, doubly so when you're a public target. Getting hacked and losing everyone's funds won't help the cause. Make sure you take the time to get this right, it's a big responsibility.

2. Be careful about gambling laws, and child permissions. They can also be complicated. It's easy to accept bch, but if you're imagining something where people can /earn/ bch that they then withdraw to their own private wallets things can get messy.

3. This is, at this moment probably not a concern, but if you are successful enough malicious actors could potentially start to move money through your platform for other than game related purposes. Just be careful.

That said, I think you're absolutely right about gaming being a great tool to drive adoption, giving people a reason to create a bitcoin wallet is the very first step. I absolutely wish you the best and I want to see you succeed.",1523045224
"Alright. I'll ask my parents tmrw if they can setup an account and cash out the BTC, but if not you might be seeing some BTC in your wallet later lol. (I'll ask for your wallet code or whatever it's called if I do decide to give it to you)

Thanks for the help.",1523045218
"Not really. Social consensus is not required for a hard-fork of a shared history in an open-source project. Consensus in the context of Bitcoin is a term used to describe the functional methods within the description of electronic coin as defined in the whitepaper https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/whitepaper/bitcoin.pdf - it is described in the conclusion. That's why it is mentioned in the last box on the bottom left of the graphic. If we didn't have language or a word to call it ""Bitcoin"" it would function as A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System or ""We define an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures"". This graphic shows that one chain is more accurately describing 'A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System' than the other.",1523045201
"&gt;It is completely disingenuous to ignore the large portion of the community that wanted large blocks and to scale bitcoin onchain.

I believe the disingenuous thing is you using such a broad word like ""large portion of the community"". I believe this is completely unfounded and untrue. I believe a *large enough* portion of the community wanted it to go off and create their own coin which they should have done instead of relying on an airdrop of Bitcoin. Everyone in that *large community* could have sold their Bitcoin and purchase BCH.

&gt; We finally have a version of bitcoin that can be used as cash, and to make payments.

What you have is an altcoin that no one uses thus has low fees. Actual BTC can be used the same way and currently has low fees. If you have ever used the Lightning Network considering you are throwing yourself in with devs and contributors 

&gt;I, along with many developers and contributors

should be able to get that up and running pretty quickly. It's cheaper than BCH and uses actual Bitcoin so that should interest you if you were actually sincere with the above quote.

&gt;It is also a little racist to imply that just because some miners are Chinese

Wow, that's your argument? Racism? Look at the facts here snowflake

- [BTC.com - 14% - Bitmain](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BTC.com)
- [ViaBTC - 17.5% - Bitmain](https://www.ccn.com/viabtc-open-bitcoin-exchange-raising-200000-funding-led-bitmain/)
- [Antpool - 8.7% - Bitmain](https://www.bitmain.com/)

40.2% - Bitmain on BCH
BCH 7D Average Hashrate is 2,400 Petahashes - Bitmain is ~965 of that.

Other - 35.3% (A large portion of this is likely Bitmain as well)

It is factual that the majority of hashrate exists in China or on a chinese pool, racism has nothing to do with this. The same problem would exist if it was in the US or EU. It's even more damning that the majority of this hashrate is controlled my a single individual through investments or shell companies (Jihan Wu).

Let's say you have a thousand excuses for how this doesn't mean shit and BCH is secure. You would be dead wrong.

Let's look at the BTC hashrate for those same companies....

- [BTC.com - 25.2% - Bitmain](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BTC.com)
- [ViaBTC - 10.1% - Bitmain](https://www.ccn.com/viabtc-open-bitcoin-exchange-raising-200000-funding-led-bitmain/)
- [Antpool - 13.7% - Bitmain](https://www.bitmain.com/)

49% which is worse than BCH, I'll give you that, but that's not the real issue as percentages mean fuck all.

BTC 7D Average Hashrate is 26,210 Petahashes - Bitmain is 12,843 of that.

That's over 5 times the **total** hashrate of BCH.

Your coin is completely insecure and could be easily attacked at any moment at the flip of a switch.

Stop being willfully ignorant and start accepting responsibility that you are helping peddle a scamcoin.

*Disclaimer: I sold over 900 BCH when it was finally released on Coinbase at $3100, Bcash has made me quite a lot of money and I thank the bagholders from the bottom of my heart*

"You really dont know the Indian gov and how they work. Politics in India are a matter of class and they litterally despise indians in lower classes which amend for 3/4 of the country. They will let them all die for few rupees more. Indians start to buy cryptos when the gov decided to cut r.500 notes. Indians like chinese dont trust banks so they often buy gold and store cash at home. It was a clear move to force people to use banks. They want to be able to control where goes the money and who got some for them to rob them saying its taxes. So of course those guys want their share. 
Crooks are a small part of every community. Most of the time they use Fiat anyway. The ""crypto are used by thug"" thing is a fantasy, an ""urban legend"". Prostitutes are paid with Fiat, drugs are paid mostly with Fiat, even the silk road was nothing to compare to any drug zone like the golden triangle or even Amsterdam in term of sales and profit, and the only crook that need crypto are international scammers lr crooked politicians who need to move a lot of cash fast. 
Truth is Indians are some of the most free minded people on earth. Tahts why hippies in the 50s through 70s chose it to settle their communities. And Indians are very business smart. When people like that discover a new way of doing things they dont wait for their gov to give them permission.

So the challenge is getting a decentralized network of contributers to agree on upgrades and when to imminent them all without a central Authority giving the word.

Also why I like Decred because the holders have the ability to vote on network changes and protocols and miners cannot just fork the coin unless they have a majority support from the owners of the coins who are participating in voting, it attempts to solve the governance issue Bitcoin has been struggling with very publicly for the past almost 3 years",1523044099

It does have a speed/scaling problem, since on-chain scaling is seen by most of the community as a dead end.

Other coins that take an entirely different approach to the problem, like Nano, *claim* to handle this better, but they have to make tradeoffs somewhere (like weaker/harder-to-understand security properties, no incentives to run nodes, questionable coin distribution), and they just haven't been around very long, or had their scaling properties seriously tested.  With anything security/reliability-critical, like a cryptocurrency system, I'd take old and proven over new and untested.

.. I'm rambling.

Bitcoin will go up. We have seen this past year its potential. As we talked about it is just another game but on a huge scale. If you are interested and have the time to, look into crypto trading rather than just hodling. At this point everyone knows about it and everyone wants in on the profits. Each spike will be bigger than the last until it reaches a plateau or crashes 100 years from now... Just another stupid game..

"Sure, which is why when Bitcoin came out it was worth almost nothing. And the market should price low strike cost of old coins into account, but you're describing the situation years ago. Any bitcoin created in the past few years absolutely had significant investment costs. This is part of why bitcoins are more expensive than other virtual tokens.

Just as it costs ""nothing"" to make a virtual token, that token is also worth no more than the network that manages it. It certainty does not cost ""nothing"" to build a massive distributed trust-less system with 3rd party attack resistance at cost-prohibitive levels for even moderately large transactions. The value isn't in the token, it's in the system that says most assuredly the token is yours, and you can give it to someone else like cash, but digitally. Any real long term value has to be considered in the context of the economy its infrastructure would support rather than the item itself. 

So long as you treat Bitcoin like a commodity instead of a currency, its value really doesn't make sense, I agree. 

&gt; Nobody ""invests"" in the dollar. An extremely small number of people bet on pip price movements between currencies.

And such bets done consistently over time with a plan is generally called investing IMO.

"I posted this deeper in a comment thread,  it's important so I'll kind of repost up here:

""BTCUSDSHORTS"" on Bitfinexis BS and it's not true short selling. It's some synthetic representation of buy interest vs sell interest, total hocum IMHO.

A short sale is when you borrow a share from an exchange, and sell it immediately.
You have to give that share back to the exchange at some point. When the price goes down, you buy a share on the open market, return it to the exchange 'covering your short'. You sell high, and buy low so you profit, instead of the reverse, buy low sell high.

* Shorting in the equities market is regulated and controlled.
* An exchange will only lend you the share if you have other assets in the exchange to cover incase you never return the share. Only the better exchange clients are approved to short typically.
* Exchanges have to accurately report how many shares they have lent out to short sellers.
* The only skin in the game for the exchange is the trading fees, which in a short sale is a double whammy, the exchange is guaranteed two fees.

Now in the unregulated crypto markets, the exchanges are NOT required to report coins lent for short sale.

Factor in that crypto started crashing almost as soon as the first CME options started trading, (options are NOT short selling). They gave a clear indication no one was very interested taking the short side of an option, hence little short interest was observed.

To a professional short seller, little short interest in a market in an obvious speculative bubble was a dream come true, and they borrowed and sold, crashing the market.

"**Money creation**

Money creation is the process by which the money supply of a country, or of an economic or monetary region , is increased. In most modern economies, most of the money supply is in the form of bank deposits. Central banks monitor the amount of money in the economy by measuring the so-called monetary aggregates.

I 100% agree with you that most of the people do not run a full node and just blindly trust their Chinese overlords who have over 70% of the mining power through various investment companies and/or partnerships.

Yes. Unless you're actively buying real crypto everytime you make a purchase with bitcoin you owe on your gains from that purchase.

Yeah, because in the end the most successful coins are the ones that worked the hardest to get there, not the ones that do what people need them to do. Again, not commenting on BCH or on any coin in particular. This is a bullshit gatekeeping argument

I currently support BCH because it's working towards becoming an actual currency that doesn't depend entirely on sidechains to function.

That's the whole point, don't you get it? To limit this as much as possible.

With small blocks and most of the txs off-chain, that's a reality, not just wishful thinking.

But thanks again for telling me you are willing to sacrifice trustlessness. THAT is why I'm not on-board with BCH. We don't need Bitcoin for that, we already have central banks. And I, personally, trust central banks much more than a bunch of miners.

You can laugh as much as you want and show whatever you wish. The point that many seem to miss about LN is that you can still transact P2P, even if there are large hubs present. Simple - Just open a channel with your intended recepient. You **don't have to** use large hubs.

And whilst you're laughing, I'll remind you that the LN is trustless - At no point you need to trust anyone. That is the whole point, and why it's not a trivial undertaking. I'll ask you to highlight how the LN requires trust, if you believe otherwise. I'm afraid we'll discover that you don't really understand the LN. Much like you have revealed you don't understand the problems with on-chain scaling in our discussion so far. Or rather, your willingness to abandon the real key features of Bitcoin - Decentralization and trustlessness.

"I think the biggest theme of the hard fork is that a large portion of the community wants the best electronic cash. Most people using BCH are not running full nodes so they don't care if blocks are 32mb or even 1gb, they want fast transactions for low fees.

"The thread that was from was full of remarkable insight and prescience. [Hal's original thread-starting email](http://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1995/09/msg00924.html) is discussing (and lamenting) how payee anonymity is hard to preserve because of the double-spend problem, and at the end he concludes:

&gt;any system which is capable of detecting double- spending just from the information which the payees send in to the bank would be vulnerable to this. Systems which use tamper-proof observer chips to prevent double spending beforehand can avoid it, but of course if someone breaks an observer the whole cash system might crash. In general it does not look like payee anonymity is possible without giving up other very important features.

It's amazing to see these legends discussing Bitcoin so many years before its launch. Hal eventually created RPOW, too, which is (essentially) the ingredient missing from the recipe back in the 90s.

Another thing that stuck out to me while reading this is the fact that they use the word ""coin"" to refer to ecash payments (including Szabo, in the email you linked). The whole ""bitcoin/bitgold"" naming overlap is already a compelling data point itself; combine it with the fact that Szabo was using the ""coin"" parlance for over a decade and you have a *really* hard-to-ignore point. And then on top of all of that, you have the ""pseudonym"" email you linked to earlier, where Szabo describes the difficulty in avoiding leaving ""pointers to your True Name""...

Honestly, you've performed some really remarkably astute research here, and I think I'm more convinced than I've ever been that Szabo is Satoshi. I had gone from convinced to skeptical to ambivalent and now (largely thanks to you) I'm back to convinced.

I've read a few of Szabo's essays here and there, but it's usually been fairly casual reading (not like the way I've obsessively combed through what Satoshi wrote). In the next few weeks, I think I'm going to take a deeper dive. If I find anything especially noteworthy, I'll be sure to send it your way.",1523041296

The current ""market-cap"" has nothing to do with any real value of BTC.   The only reason the ""market-cap"" has not yet fallen to zero is that there are still enough people (some of whom have already lost their shirts) who still foolishly  believe that the past will be repeated.

A short sale is when you borrow a share from an exchange,  and sell it immediately.

You have to give that share back to the exchange at some point.  When the price goes down,  you buy a share on the open market,  return it to the exchange 'covering your short'.  You sold high,  and bought low so you profit,  instead of the opposite,  buy low sell high.

* Shorting in the equities market is regulated and controlled.
* An exchange will only lend you the share if you have other assets in the exchange to cover incase you never return the share.  Only the better ecchange clients are approved to short typically.
* exchanges have to accurately report how many shares they have lent out to short sellers.
* the only skin in the game for the exchange is the trading fees,  which in a short sale is a double whammy,  the exchange is guaranteed TWO fees.

Now in the unregulated crypto markets,  the exchanges are NOT required to do anything!

Now factor in that crypto started crashing almost as soon as the first CME options started trading,  (options are NOT short selling).  They gave a clear indication no one was very interested taking the short side of an option,  hence LITTLE SHORT interest was observed.

Indeed, it means the difference between bigger blocks making Bitcoin easier to attack and **bigger blocks - even at the gigabyte and terabyte level - making Bitcoin harder to attack.

"Szabo has a degree in Computer Science so he is definitely capable of programming, and is just as cypherpunk as Finney.

The big problem with the ""Hal wrote the code"" theory is that whoever piloted the Satoshi mouthpieces (that is to say, whoever ""spoke as Satoshi in all the emails and forum posts"") was quite obviously one person with a consistent voice, and this person quite obviously knew the code backwards and forwards, inside and out. Whoever was doing the public speaking was *also* doing the programming; check out Satoshi's BitcoinTalk account history and this becomes very clear very quickly. 95%+ of the posts are technical in nature and regarding esoteric minutae, and yet are spoken in the same ""voice"" and expressed in an unwaveringly-consistent way.

So it becomes a question of ""Well if Hal was writing the code, then what was Nick doing?"" and this should be a clue that you took a wrong turn somewhere along the way.

But Hal *did* contribute code to Bitcoin. He did so as Hal Finney, [using his ""halfinney"" account](https://github.com/halfinney/bitcoin). The theory that he was ""part of Satoshi"" just doesn't make any sense, and doesn't answer any questions satisfactorily.

Meanwhile, Szabo was writing [back in 1993](http://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1993/10/msg00759.html) about his own struggles in terms of keeping his pseudonyms secured properly, and discussing tools and techniques to ""avoid leaving pointers to my True Name lying around -- excess **mail to/from my True Name**, shared files, common peculiarities (eg misspellings in written text), traceable logins, etc.""

If Finney and Szabo *were* collaborating as Satoshi, it seems pretty obvious that Szabo would have strongly discouraged Finney from chiming in too early on the initial mailing list announcement, and from being the ""first ever recipient of a Bitcoin transaction""... that stuff would just be *sloppy* beyond the point of tolerability, and directly violate the ""avoid pointers to your True Name"" principle that Szabo was so concerned with.

&gt; To implement a distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis, we will need to use a proof-of-work system similar to Adam Back's Hashcash [6], rather than newspaper or Usenet posts.

"**1.When we say Moore's law, it's really a bastardization of the phrase, because we're really talking about performance.**

&gt;Despite a popular misconception, Moore is adamant that he did not predict a doubling ""every 18 months"". Rather, David House, an Intel colleague, had factored in the increasing performance of transistors to conclude that integrated circuits would double in performance every 18 months.

&gt;Most semiconductor industry forecasters, including Gordon Moore,[92] expect Moore's law will end by around 2025.[93][94][95]

&gt;In April 2005, Gordon Moore stated in an interview that the projection cannot be sustained indefinitely: ""It can't continue forever. The nature of exponentials is that you push them out and eventually disaster happens."" He also noted that transistors eventually would reach the limits of miniaturization at atomic levels:

&gt;In terms of size [of transistors] you can see that we're approaching the size of atoms which is a fundamental barrier, but it'll be two or three generations before we get that far—but that's as far out as we've ever been able to see. We have another 10 to 20 years before we reach a fundamental limit. **By then they'll be able to make bigger chips and have transistor budgets in the billions.**

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law

**2.You don't need to store every transaction, just the UTXO set, and the block headers.**

&gt;7.Reclaiming Disk Space

&gt;Once the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before it can be discarded to save disk space. To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash, transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [7][2][5], with only the root included in the block's hash. Old blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree. The interior hashes do not need to be stored.


&gt;A block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes. If we suppose blocks are generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year. With computer systems typically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of 1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in memory.

http://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin/#selection-191.4-223.371

All you need to store and distribute are the block headers, and the transactions for the unspent coins!

There's a reason why it was built the way it was, with Merkle Trees and block headers.

**3.We can do 1 GB blocks today, on a consumer grade laptop.**

Which isn't even necessary, because:

&gt;Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe 
for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for 
double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or 
about 12KB per day. Only people trying to create new coins would need to run 
network nodes. At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the 
network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to 
specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would 
only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with 
that one node.

&gt;The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think. A typical transaction 
would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact). Each transaction has to be 
broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction. Visa processed 37 billion 
transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day. 
That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 
2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.

&gt;If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, 
sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.

**4.See #2 above ^**

**5. Fees will remain low.**

As long as there is competition to mine blocks, fees will remain low. The beauty of Bitcoin, is that it's permissionless. If the miners become too centralized, and/or the fees become too high, it will just wind up getting forked. Some things which would get major pushback today, may be necessary in the future, like changing the hashing algorithm. Or even introducing a small amount of inflation (1% or less per year) because of ""lost"" coins, may seem like a good idea in the future. And if it's actually implemented, people can choose whether they want to use it or not.

&gt;You won't scale on-chain globally. You just won't. Well, not if you want a crypto that is around in 50yrs, that is. Sure, you can scale on-chain for the next 10yrs, with huge centralization pressures, and end up with PayPal 2.0. But this is not something I'm interested in. No compromises.

The world we live in today was made by people who were told ""you can't"" ""you won't"" ""not possible"" etc.

&gt;Now please tell me I'm a Blockstream shill/sockpuppet/brainwashed. 

If that's what you think of yourself, then so be it.

&gt;And, again, point me to your contribution so we can have a rational debate.

Just someone with critical thinking skills, which seem to be in short supply these days. Doesn't matter though, as it's projected that human brain simulations will be possible in just seven years:

&gt;The first complete simulation of a single neuron was perfected in 2005. This was followed by a neocortical column with 10,000 neurons in 2008; then a cortical mesocircuit with 1,000,000 neurons in 2011. A team of researchers from the Allen Institute in Seattle achieved a major milestone in 2014 by simulating an entire mouse brain, containing 75 million neurons.

"&gt;Segwit2x did have overwhelming consensus

SegWit2x had two, completely distinct parts that were *completely* decoupled.

The first was BIP91, which was an agreement by miners to orphan any blocks not signaling for the activation of SegWit. This was a direct response to BIP148. Activating SegWit had overwhelming community consensus, but little miner consensus until BIP91. They were essentially blocking the upgrade.

The second was a hard fork to double the max block weight. This was *extremely* controversial in the community and had no community consensus, evidenced by the fact that it was cancelled by its organizers **[for lack of consensus](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-segwit2x/2017-November/000685.html)**. It also had little to no miner consensus, as evidenced by the fact that miners never mined SegWit2x blocks. There's also the fact that the code had numerous *critical* bugs which would have hampered their ability to do so even if they wanted.

"My apologies, but I don't really see the benefit of sharing the same genesis block. 

While completely full blocks are an issue, my point is that the Bitcoin Cash chain is seeing so little traffic that had they kept the 1 MB block limit it wouldn't have made a difference. You can't expect to be the ""real Bitcoin"" let alone be a dominant coin if not a lot of people are using it or developing for it. ",1523038890
"How about I just post from the article so you can read it for yourself. Keep in mind, this is talking about in the near term future:

Once a miner has found a target hash, there is a strong incentive of quickly broadcasting the corresponding block, otherwise, another miner might win the mining race by broadcasting faster its own alternative block in the mean time. However, by the time a block is found, the bulk of its content, the transactions is already known to the other miners. Thus, the only information that needs to be transferred is a compact filter which points out the exact set of transactions that has been included in the block.

This mechanism is leveraged by Graphene, which reduces the amount of data that needs to be broadcast when a new block is found to a fraction of the original block size. Graphene demonstrates a compression factor of 186, which would bring down a 1TB block to 5.5GB. As the mining rig has a 50Gbps network connection, it will take less than 1 second to transfer the the full payload to a second miner, triggering an exponential cascade of broadcasts. However, it would be inefficient for the receiving miner to wait for the full payload to be received; the cascade of broadcast would usually start from the first ""chunk"" received. The Graphene payload would be chunked in smaller chunks, of say, 100MB.

Indeed, the economic interest of the miners is to always work on the latest block, thus if a miner claim to have found a new valid block and that the latest, say, 100 claims made by the same miner all proved to be correct, then it would a profitable assumption to put a limited trust into this miner and immediately start the cascade of broadcasts. Breaching this trust would not earn anything to the miner as its peers would still reject the faulty block within a minute. Worse, the bad behaving miner would immediately lose its hard-earned reputation, hence slowing down the propagation of its own future blocks, for tens of blocks, as the other miners would opt for the full prior validation. In practice, such a miner would most likely have to re-earn the trust of its peers by mining dozens of reduced blocks (faster to transmit), forfeiting most of the transaction fees to the benefit of its peers.

Through an early broadcast, and assuming that the Bitcoin network is comprised of miners with similar or superior internet bandwidth, the full broadcast of the 5.5GB to 10,000 miners is straightforward to achieve in 10 seconds or so, assuming that each miner starts propagating the fresh data upon reception of the first chunk, which would happen in less than 200ms no matter the distance between two miners on earth.

Even if all this fails, if even things as big as VeChain or new innovations like IOTA turn out to not work out in the future, I still have a shit ton of MOD, and will have a shit ton of SMARC, which will payoff pretty fucking well imo regardless of what happens to the crypto ""market""",1523038810
"How do you figure he had a 50k tax bill?
I don’t know about the states but I thought it was 20% capital gains tax on profit realised.
So if he’s paid $7,200 per BTC= $57,600 if he bought eight.
He sells for $120,000, so that’s $120,000 minus his original investment, which equals $62,400, which is the profit realised, plus you must in the US have a capital gains tax free allowance if so minus that first.

But for the sake of simplicity let’s not include that and work off deducting 20% off $62,400 which equals=$12,480 in TAX.
So his net profit should be $49,920 NET,
Plus this figure is without any other things like fee’s ect... that should also be tax deductible. 

Also you can  say something is a taxable event  only if a profit is realised, meaning if your profit dropped too below the point at which you realised a profit, then you would be in loss, and that loss would be tax deductible against any gains.

I don’t know the US tax system but in the U.K. the HMRC won’t tax something you haven’t had, and you only have when the money is transferred into fiat.

Enlighten me please as I don’t see how this guy is in this situation.",1523038794
"Cool, so if he continues on promising and not delivering then he'll be outcasted by this smart community that casted out LN and Bitcoin Core. ",1523038748
Really happy to see this type of comment. Everyone new in crypto should listen to the veterans when they come out strongly against a coin. Sometimes it's not about FUD but about legitimately critisizing a bad project / scam. ,1523038716

"That is true, but also irrelevant.

Your own impatience and fear are what is costing you. Courage. Patience. If you don't find them, others with those attributes will indeed take your money and your coins.

Crypto is not a market for impatient cowards. Those types get completely rekt.",1523038517
"Indeed, if you redefine gamma AND redefined what negative means, then craig is right.

However, ""negative gamma"" only contains two words, and, as a result, having to redefine two to be right is not exactly a stellar performance.

And even though the article claim that would make it right, it still doesn't, but we don't even need to get there, because that thing is a fractal of errors. Getting to them all is a gigantic waste of time. One could qualify this as a DoS attack on the scientific community in the crypto space.",1523038489

The difference in our two approaches here is you are making a subjective argument based 100% on an appeal to authority, while I'm simply describing Bitcoin's consensus mechanism as it actually exists, and always has.

The only way to undermine Bitcoin's consensus is through social engineering, overthrowing Nakamoto Consensus and replacing it with an appeal to authority. But in doing that you destroy Bitcoin. You will be better off simply supporting your favored altcoin as Bitcoin Cash. Arguments will get you nowhere, asI've shown.

"No, I have no Bitcoin Cash. But what I'm getting at is that if you buy 1 bitcoin at $10,000.  You could immediately spend the 1 bitcoin and pay no income taxes on it, right?

Let's say you move the bitcoin from coinbase to binance exchange. You can then say you ""spent"" the bitcoin and no longer have it. IRS has no way of knowing and you would not file anything with IRS regarding bitcoin because you did not have any taxable income from bitcoin still/yet. 

This is the principle I've used for the last 8 or so years. In 2017 I made no bitcoin withdrawal so I did not file any bitcoin taxes for last year. As I miner in previous years I have withdrawn bitcoin to my USD bank account and I filed it as a loss because it was mined not purchased and thus there's no proof of what I ""paid"" for it. So I ended up getting money back from IRS on bitcoin even though I actually profited and should have paid income tax on it. ",1523037876
"Ok let’s not insult me, let’s say you have accumulated BTC at an average cost of $5000, and you want to buy something for $1,000 when the value of BTC is $10,000, you would have a $500 taxable gain. Now let’s say you take your bitcoin and you deposit it into a lending/payment channel(escrow) do all your business back and forth off chain. A month down the road I want to close out, rather than using the BTC that you bought at half the current price, I want the option to hold that BTC and use new BTC at the current market price to settle my channel.

If you are holding your BTC at a loss, you may want to settle with it in lieu.",1523037853

It was completely fair. I know it sounds shady, but look back at the raiblocks sub/discord during that time. I remember there were still hundreds of us. I myself didn't join till the 2nd last day of distribution (was not aware it was the 2nd last day) and there were plenty of people, my point is the devs didn't premine and give everything to themselves. Yes, they also did captchas themselves, The lead dev was able to quit his job to become a full time dev in december during the pump. Vitalik had like what? 12 million ETH at the highest?

"We're looking at where we're going, not where we are. 

The same argument for the 1mb limit could have been made in 2011 when blocks were only a few kilobytes in size. It only became a problem when average block size finally reached 1mb, and we've seen the drastic distortion this causes in the network live now in BTC that results in high wait times and insane fees. BTC is literally broken in this configuration. 

A high block size threshold enables BCH to handle peak traffic. Real block sizes will always float in size depending on network traffic, which is how Bitcoin was always designed to operate, governed by other economic forces. As such it doesn't matter that average BCH blocks are less than 1mb. 32mb is only an upper boundary where that is as big as one block *can be*, and allows block size to scale organically. 

Bitcoin started with a 32mb limit as coded by the hand of Satoshi himself, which is due to some other limitations of the protocol and not a centrally planned limit. BCH is restoring this in May as the 1mb limitation was only supposed to be temporary and was no longer needed the minute BTC had a fiat conversion rate, which was years ago. ",1523037710

"That's not my point. I **didn't** read his article, mostly because the article is not about the main point as to why Sirer paper has some problems. Even with the sybil being pretty much absent/inefficient, the model Sirer built still works; btw gamma cannot be zero as per definition of the article, it is a ratio of HM joining to mine on top of the SM private block just published, that can NOT be &lt; 0. This is a basic mistake in failing to address the article model, and of course I'd be upset if I wrote that article and someone tweets my article is cancer and writes a complete non sequitur and attack me.

The problem with SM theory is not the elaborated math, math can prove whatever you want if you don't consider all the possible situations. For instance, a very mundane situation where the other pools withhold blocks. Thus we need to redesign the markov process to be more general.

Why is this left outside? Because sirer wanted to throw a punch in some conceptions in the bitcoin community, especially the one saying that mining on top of the just published block is the best strategy to maximize profits. There are other problems there too, but what I dislike about the article was the unwarranted conclusions that bitcoin does not work since the SM strategy snow balls to a 51% majority. This is a wishful thinking at best.

Anyway, my point there above was that the behavior of the people debunking CSW. I'm totally fine if you take the time to write and point all the crap written in CSW articles (dozens of articles will have plenty of them), we should do this with everything. The person doing it either is right or will commit a mistake in public, that's how it is.

I think there are enough level headed individuals throughout government to recognize the legitimacy of crypto and bring regulation to it before it gets banned.

The only way it would get banned is if banks influence enough politicians and convince them to either suppress it to the ground, or outright ban it entirely.

"Just give me one second to do some critical thinking.   

Who has the most to loose if BCH becomes the top crypto, and with or without CSW it does in fact become able to do things like privacy and tokens??  

When the one person who has the most to loose makes a desperate ploy to discredit anything it makes me want to take a second look.  

Etherium hurts BTC just as much or more than BCH does. 

If Etherium returned it's market share to BTC values would skyrocket. 

Vatalik isn't afraid of BTC,  but he is clearly desperate to discredit CSW.  

Why all the effort??    I want a second look.  

I know that if some arsehole showed up and started calling my project ""destined to wither and die"" I would want to discredit him also.   

I see this as a defensive and desperate move.  If CSW is such a sham then why worry,  just kick back and be rich.  

But if CSW is eating your lunch and has something that really can threaten Etherium then I see why the desperation is so much on the surface.  

The bottom line is that if CSW posses no threat to etherium then why bother....... 

But since he did bother,  I have to assume Etherium is under direct threat from BCH ",1523037292

"I don't believe you that a fork would be considered a taxable event. For a few reasons:

1. What would the amount be? There's no monetary value associated with the forked coin until it's sold. And if we go off the first sale I, a single individual with a regular computer, could go fuck everyone right now with that logic. Go create a shit coin, create functional marketplace, sell shit coin to myself for $1,000,000. Do you and everybody else who holds owe based on that number? Of course not. Alternatively I could spam shitcoin forks for much smaller sale amounts and achieve the same goal.
2. Even if we assumed that were the case, another exploit is now you are *legally obligated* to sign up for my marketplace since it's the only one where you can trade my shitcoin. I'll take all your social security numbers now thanks.
3. Nothing about my asset changed what changed is how I can sell it. This is the same as a stock split which from my cursory research is not a taxable event.

I appreciate that IRS tax law doesn't have to make sense but this interpretation of a taxable event is so easily exploitable I can't see any way they would enforce this.

I should clarify that if you *sell* Bitcoin Cash that it is *taxable event* and your profit is *taxable income* of course. But a hard fork is not a *taxable event*.",1523037037

So, you won't win any points for acting like we're all noobs here, we were also around before the need for /btc existed.

"Good point. The problem I see is the economic model of utility tokens. The more companies that use a certain block chain the more expensive the token becomes which is better for investors, but worse for businesses. How could businesses forecast their tech budgets if the cost of that application could change on a daily basis?  With SAP or any other SAAS there are efficiencies and scales built into the enterprise side. On the crypto side, the utility token would make it an impossible cost for companies to understand. I do believe the gas system is the best fix for this. As this is a young space I am excited to see how current crypto companies approach the economic model of this other than just listing their tokens on exchanges. On the other hand, private companies that deploy block chain as a SAAS level will gain more traction on the enterprise side than anything currently traded on the exchanges.",1523036883

"&gt; why the best crypto isn´t top 3

&gt; why do I keep seeing a lot of ppl aggressive towards BCH ... MOST of the people!

Your second question answers your first question.  The price of a coin is adoption + speculation.  Right now adoption accounts for less than 1% of the price and speculation at least 99%.  If the market keeps crashing and all the speculators leave, adoption will become the major factor for price and the prophetic 'flippening' will occur.

The mistake of many BCH investors is believing that having the best bitcoin is enough to cause everybody to wake up and switch to BCH.  Nothing can be further from the truth.  The crypto market is 99% speculators who want to buy bitcoin so they can sell it at a higher price in the near future.  The censorship and propaganda campaign indoctrinates them all that BCH is a scam and BTC is where they should put their money.

There is a long-shot strategy where BCH speculators hope it will build a big enough ecosystem that will be impossible to ignore in spite of censorship and propaganda.  If that succeeds then a flood of speculators will pour into BCH and trigger a flippening.

"&gt;I’d pay the taxes on the 30k. Who in their right mind would try to get away with that?

There is nothing illegal about not paying your taxes so long as you pay the penalty and interest to the IRS.  It happens a lot in bankruptcy proceedings,  large estates that go to probate,  weird stuff like that. 

|Also, how the hell could you spend 30k that fast.

Here is a scenario illustrating to don't have to spend a penny

You buy bitcoin early in 2017 worth $1000

Later it is worth $10,000,  so you do what a lot of early 'traders' did,  sell 10% of your holdings to recoup your initial investment,  and you now have $9,000 in bitcoin profit that is your 'further investment money',  (you think).  So you take your bitcoins and start trading them into alt coins.  Before 2017 ends,  you have a diversified portfolio,  %25 BTC,  10% ??? ....   whatever.

So that means you sold 75% of your bitcoin when you traded it for your alt coin portfolio.

Uncle Sam will tax those sales.

So Now it's 2018,  and you realize you own tax on more than the 10% sale to fiat,  you own tax on the 75% (of the remaining 90%) to traded into alts.

Your tax bill is larger than you expected,  and you don't have the cash to pay those taxes,  so you have to sell NOW regardless,  because you are SO afraid of being in debt to the IRS!

To give some perspective about Dash:

The ""privacy-coin"" that hires KYC/AML specialists to track their own users.

""It should also be noted, within dash Mr Więcko's job title is ""Project Manager"" yet his background is in banking and, in particular, compliance.""

""Coinfirm serves as a foundation for the safe adoption and use of blockchain. Our Blockchain Compliance &amp; Analytics Platform uses proprietary algorithms and big data analysis to deliver actionable data that increases efficiency, reduces costs and streamlines compliance to near automation.""

""Customized AML Risk data for governments, financial institutions and business intelligence companies""

""Coinfirm’s platform uses proprietary algorithms and big data analysis to provide actionable data on blockchain transactions and parties.""

""Search and check blockchain addresses to get initial AML and financial risk assessment results for free""

""Generate comprehensive reports on AML and financial risk assessment of blockchain addresses and users.""

Dash is compliant crypto and looks to become as mainstream as possible. I would never rely on them for privacy.


When it comes to NAV, it's a jack of all trade coin. It tries to do everything, be fast, PoS, dapps, privacy etc. It could turn out to be a cool coin but when it comes to privacy it is inferior.

"Not only are multisig and payment channels excellent examples of smart contracts, but technically *every single Bitcoin transaction* is a smart contract, believe it or not, because of how the Bitcoin Script system works.

Each transaction is basically a ""reassignment of conditions that must be fulfilled to 'spend' a certain UTXO"" and though most are of the (relatively simple) form: ""allow spending if a valid signature corresponding to public key XYZ accompanies the output"", under-the-hood this is expressed in a much more versatile Script language than you might initially expect.

I think the point you're trying to make (which, if you don't mind me paraphrasing, is something like ""fully Turing-expressive smart contracting capabilities are massively overrated and overhyped relative to their utility versus much simpler and more practical smart contracts like Bitcoin's transactions"") is totally valid, though. It's true that ""smart contracts"" is basically a buzzword these days, and most of the ""flashy"" examples that jump to mind are pretty ridiculous when you take a close look at them.",1523036221
"From my perspective this does nothing that miners dont already do with first seen. When a transaction comes in from a peer that record is a timestamp. A "" P2P ansible miner"" is just a miner timestamping his own transaction as it comes in from another peer or a wallet. Timestamping in a p2p fashion must be resolved by the network comparing timestamps. Where is this addressed? Also a miner subset can just create a fake set of stamps, rewriting the transaction order. The same goes for block hash stamping. What mechanism prevents this? 

&gt; Let’s immediately point out that taking the fee and successfully defrauding the payee would make the miner an accomplice of the fraud in every court of justice
. This point alone is a cause of concern for the miner, because suddenly, it is no more merely a dishonorable company frowned upon, but plain organized crime, which is actively fought by authorities. Then, the other miners themselves, the honest ones playing the long game, would probably sever their network ties, blacklisting the dishonest miner

This kind of talk is complete garbage. Relying on an external authority for your system simply means you have not solved the problem and is bad system design. CSW said the same cringy thing regarding fraud proofs being handed off to ""Authorities"". Just design the thing that properly rejects double spends and you dont need an external authority, that is the entire purpose of bitcoin to be self regulating.

&gt; Then, if miners routinely observe that the Ansible happens to be accurate in predicting the outcome from a block propagation race as well, precisely leveraging the timestamp issued for the block hash; then, all miners (except to two having a stake at having their own block winning the race) should rationally take advantage of this information to start working the block that is
deemed the winner by the Ansible timestamps.

I dont understand this, who would wait for a block to be timestamped by ansible? they would just publish the block as fast as possible. ",1523036219

Interactive Broker sold an option that’s worth $250 ish for $4 for whatever margin requirement? How do long options fall under margin requirement? Idk and idc at this point. Another positive in the crypto is that you don’t need to deal with bunch of other dumb rules like PDT (Pattern Day Trading).

Edit: This is my personal account they liquidated, where I only have options left. The other 10% of stocks are in my Roth IRA. However, Roth IRA only has GBTC anyway haha. ",1523035840

If any one person has power like that, I'm afraid bitcoin is, indeed, a failed experiment, as Mike Hearn has said. I believe BCH will survive this shit storm of CSW propaganda. That is all it is, propaganda.

CSW is simply the subject of the next attempt at dividing the BCH community. Clearly it is working, judging by your post.

If you give a shit about Craig Wright you are admitting that authority figures matter in this stateless, permissionless revolution.",1523035814

Sorry but it was premined to the devs. You are the one who doesn't understand it. How did the captchas hold the coins in the first place? It wasn't on the lattice. It was centralized servers placed by the devs themselves. Premined. And unfair.

"The only source more reliable than ""crypto experts"" are ""wall street economists"" or ""government studies""",1523035635
Really believe a fair valuation of BTC at 2.7K which would bring in potential big buyers. I think BTC is trying to find its fair value which will be determined by a flood of big money. Right now the big money still believes BTC is over-valued.,1523035619

"neglecting to report is an unknown to me.  In the US,  because the exchanges were compelled to turn over a list of their top transactors,  and the IRS is so omnipotent,  my guess is compliance will be 'normal', only the crazy fringe would try and get away with not reporting.

"We now live in a service based society not the agrarian one that defined the 1929 financial marketplace. It’s why service companies such as Twitter and Facebook have substantially higher value than Archer Daniels Midland, one of the world’s largest food companies. An ironic proof of this was Zynga games, makers of FarmVille, actually tried to have an IPO higher than ADM’s marketcap. Anyway, we now live in a service world in which each of these high value services run on databases. Decentralized data and currency will replace our current hub and spoke economy and data infrastructure allowing us to shift to an entirely point to point world. This will change the service economy as dramatically as the shift from an agrarian to manufacturing economy, or manufacturing to service economy. 

Crypto DOES represent real value. Real value in services. The world has changed, and new currency and exchange has been invented to define a new economy. Just as we no longer pay for bulk silk with bags of doubloons, we will no longer pay for services with visa and wire transfers. ",1523035563
"Correct, I should have worded that better, I just meant that it was basically when Bitcoin XT was released that the heavy censorship and disinformation against on-chain scaling began on /bitcoin. That is when I and many others noticed a swift and stark turn to the dark side. Bitcoin Cash is indeed the end result of the campaign XT started. The community forked, the chain forked, and here we are to continue Satoshi's legacy.",1523035557
"Why can't they use Bitcoin to send money all over the world? They only need one currency and they should choose the one that is most secured and the one most are using. Remittances have been working for Bitcoin. Checkout Bitcoin in Uganda on YouTube.

"I think its interesting Satoshi explicity came out and said ""I am not Dorian Nakamoto"" when he claimed to be Satoshi, and that never once happened for Craig. Instead 4 very well respected leaders in the Bitcoin space came out and stated Craig proved to them he held the Satoshi keys and Core developers then  locked Gavin out of the Github repo as soon as Gavin said he believed Craig was Satoshi.

Now start to think, is there any reason Craig wouldn't want to be publicly exposed as SN? Did Craig voluntarily come out as SN or was he forced? 

Apply some critical thinking and what occurred becomes clearer in scope.",1523035529
"This is the same question I grapple with. Block chain is the future, but not in the format we are used to. What I see is block chain applications for easy settlements and elimination of 3rd party documentation and verification providers. What I don't see is why a company would go and buy 1,000,000 of a utility coin to gain access to a block chain. More than anything a company can create their own block chain or use some centralized provider for block chain tech. I am in the market to try to make money in a volatile market, and I do not believe anything in the top 100 will be around (other than bitcoin) in 5 years.

"There are no unilateral arguments.

Satoshi is on record saying we should scale on chain, Bitcoin is peer to peer cash, BTC is now off-chain scaling oriented and a store of value not meant for poor people to use.

You took over bitcoin and morphed into an altcoin, we kept everything satoshi designed, especially the carefully balanced Nash-equilibrium among the participants. Now you have hubs on lightning network who are generating revenue in a manner completely outside the incentive model the bitcoin white paper explicitly describes.

BCH is Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin. ",1523035451

2. People can express their concerns freely and openly (what went wrong with BTC).

3. People are free to run the software or not.",1523035299
"See, the issue isnt paying taxes for what is legitimately owed. Its paying taxes one capital gains for transactions between coins when NO MONEY IS SEEN.

The IRS wants us to PAY THEM for selling BTC to buy ETH, or ETH to NEO, or NEO to ICX. They treat crypto like its property but in reality, its currency in this scenario, not property. 

99% of the population doesn't have 39% of their 'gains' in liquid cash sitting on the sidelines to pay uncle sam. IRS is expecting us to pay them with money that hasn't even been realized yet, and in many situations, doesn't fucking exist because the market crashed hard as fuck in January. 

Say you deposit $500 in May of 2017 and you work your way up to $50,000 by December 2017. December 31st you decide to trade BTC for NEO and your portfolio doubles to $100k by Jan 15th 2018. Market crashes and youre now down to $10k by Feb 15th. By the IRS standards, you have to pay income tax on that $49,500 earned despite not seeing a fucking DIME of that money. Its tied up in investments. its not liquid. You have to have roughly 23-39% of that 49.5k set aside to pay income tax with..but what if you dont have that? what if you put your last fucking $500 into crypto in May to moonshot.

"Listen here. It's not about not paying taxes. Everyone would want to pay tax if it was limited. Once you earn money and till you spetd it, you would be paying 30-60% of it in taxes. You do understand the problem here right? This is why people want to not pay taxes. Its blood sucking.
Also, rich never had to pay much taxes. They always had means to skip tax payments. Now that middle class and poor also can do this is what government is worried about. 
What is hidden however is the secret tax levied which is called inflation. At a rate of 4-7% per year, it steals purchasing power from savers and retired people. In about 10-15 years, half your money is gone in terms of purchasing power. Bitcoin solves this. It provides a way out of this theft. Your money is yours and no one can secretly steal it. It is financial freedom and freedom to own asssets.
Why we get upset is that India isn't the first country to start this policy of taking away financial rights of its citizens. Many have attempted before and every country has gone to the point of starvation. Check Venezuela, Greece, Cyprus etc. If government bans personal right to buy anything that we want, India is going to see a bad future. The rich and powerful always have the means to escape. The poor will be taken hostage where they'll have to eat cockroaches to survive. Because now what they believed in 'paper money' is worthless.

It needs to stabilize. And then it needs to demonstrate the ability to mitigate shocks to its system. Only then will buyers and sellers be willing to use them for transactions. Until then most of the interest in it will be speculation, just like gold.

"this passage here:

&gt;Rational miners who intend to be competitive require a signal as accurate as possible. Indeed,
having access to an accurate signal is of high practical importance because it lets them process
faster (more on that below) any incoming block found by another miner, precisely because of
the very accuracy of the signal itself. Then, as a miner knows that its competitors, being good at
competing, will rationally seek this very competitive edge as well, the miner can trust that
emitting a block fully aligned with the signal itself will propagate faster, hence securing another
competitive edge.
A miner who has access to a more accurate signal can validate blocks faster because:
● all the CPU intensive cryptographic operations can be done ahead of time
● all the I/O intensive UTXO operations can be done ahead of time (to be reverted only for
poison transactions).
Based on the faster block processing claim (just demonstrated), we have almost completed the
demonstration of the self-prophetic effectiveness of an accurate signal. The one remaining gap
in this demonstration is that a rational but dishonest miner remains capable of closely following
the signal, except for his very own double-spend attempts, which have near-zero impact on
block propagation time.

is what I'm referring to, it goes on later to state-

&gt;Indeed, a rational but dishonest miner has no reason to abide with the double-spend attempts of
other users as there is no profit to be gained. If the miner takes a bribe through a higher
transaction fee, then the miner automatically graduates to the position of organized crime which,
as detailed previously, is an unenviable position if the miner can’t exercise power on who gets
defrauded.
Moreover, delaying the propagation on a newfound block is an expensive practice, already
costing the miner about $15 per second for a blockchain network demonstrating full 1MB blocks.
If Bitcoin ever grows to anything significant for the world economy, this degraded latency is at
odds with the preservation of the anonymity of the miner through Tor or something similar.

though I'm not sure the negatives of a slower propagation time outweighs the benefits of holding back your competition, specifically in a large block scenario where as CSW proponents put things Bitcoin forms a 'near complete graph' (all-to-all), and perhaps pre-processing is a better term than pre-validation, all the 'organized crime' stuff seems silly but thats another discussion",1523033654

Bitcoin is basically a material digital asset and that's what's revolutionary about it. If you don't see it, you don't see it. Too bad for you. What it enables (independent and permissionless transfer and storage of value) is important today and it will get even more important with time - especially once paper money/cash is abolished. Without bitcoin (or some other autonomous cryptocurrency) we'll then be living in a world, where ALL our transactions are recorded, meaning in a world of totalitarian surveillance. Fuck that.

"Is your reply ANYTHING else but a giant appeal to authority??? Can you do some critical thinking? Please point me to your contribution, if there is any.

Anyway, here's my contribution:


&amp;nbsp;


**1 - Moore's law is basically dead**

* [It's not only about physics, but also economics, investment for new research](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/end-of-moores-law-its-not-just-about-physics/)

* [MIT review about it](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601441/moores-law-is-dead-now-what/)

* Assuming we'll overcome the obstacles is nothing but wishful thinking at this point, not a serious ""business plan"". We may, but what if we don't? Hope for the best, but get ready for the worst... THAT's a sound business plan, not the other way around. And if we fuck up now, we'll suffer a GIANT setback, easily a 30-50yrs setback.

**2 - I'll assume for valid [Nielsen's law](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/law-of-bandwidth/) for Internet bandwidth** - A 50% increase in speed every year. (Only true for high end users, but let's say it's true for everyone.)

* 1Mb blocks (talking about effective block size, not limits) increase the blockchain by ~50GB/yr. Current blockchain size is ~160GB. That's a ~33% increase in blockchain size. 2MB blocks lead to a 66% increase. 4MB blocks lead to ~130% increase in size. I'm sure I don't need to continue. Thus, with 2MB blocks the blockchain is growing **FASTER** than tech improves. Remember, that is.. with **2**MB blocks. 1GB blocks? Fuggheddabboutit. And 1GB is **NOT** enough for global scale. 

* For comparison, though not an apple-for-apples comparison, last year in July [ETH full/archivial nodes could not be fully synced in 14 days](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/143/what-are-the-ethereum-disk-space-needs) on common consumer hardware. What this shows is that syncing up everything already is a challenge TODAY, not in 10yrs. In other words, Blockchain growth/bloat is a real issue.

* Conclusion: Syncing a full node from zero becomes **impossible** over, say, ten years. That is, *not even a server farm/high end user could do it*. Harsh reality, but unavoidable. And assuming Nielsen's law continues to hold for the next 10yrs. What if it doesn't? Again, wishful thinking is not a sound business plan.

**3 - You will need 1GB blocks sooner than you think**

* S-curve adoption... not linear. At the first inflection is actually close to exponential.


**4 - Cheap block space WILL lead to abuse/bloat**

* If you think people won't abuse the blockchain, you are mistaken. If the fee for an on-chin txs is cheap, here's a business idea that will completely clutter the blockchain. Build website that allows to publish message on blockchain for a small fee, say $5. Target customers, teenagers and 20-somethings in love. Why? Because ""*Your love is for ever, inscribe onto the blockchain!*"" Watch the deluge of love-bird messages flooding the blockchain, only to be stored **FOR EVER!!**. 

* You think that would never happen? Censorship resistance, remember? How are you gonna stop it? [This bridge](https://www.alternativeceremoniesuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/locks_two.jpg) was also not built to sustain the weight of love, but it's now under strain, and [the padlocks are being taken down](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/02/world/europe/paris-bridges-locks-of-love-taken-down.html). Which is a bit like saying they are being ""censored""... but that cannot be done if censorship is not an option.

**5 - Fees WILL rise, to avoid point 4**

* Whether that's because miners refuse to mine low-fee txs or because a min fee is established doesn't matter, it's only inevitable...

* ... and my claim is that fees will, ultimately, be the same as if we had small blocks! Yes, that's a very controversial claim, and would require an extensive debate on its own. In short, it's because ""*There is no free lunch*"". If small blocks = high fees and big blocks = low fees, who pays for the difference? Someone must, no free lunch. Initially, miners and big server farms. But once those businesses become big and strongly corporatized, those costs will be passed onto users, in the form of higher fees. At equilibrium, the fees will match. (Don't want to discuss this any further... just food for thought at this point.)

"&gt; LN is the preferred solution for true micropayments, say up to ~$50. (Don't debate me on the number, it's just a personal guesstimate.)

I will debate you on the number, because Satoshi himself defined micropayments, and also said that Bitcoin could handle them on-chain.

&gt;Once it gets bootstrapped, there are so many applications if you could effortlessly pay a few cents to a website as easily as dropping coins in a vending machine.

Also this:

&gt;Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts. Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible.

And especially this:

&gt;Bitcoin isn't currently practical for very small micropayments. Not for things like pay per search or per page view without an aggregating mechanism, not things needing to pay less than 0.01. The dust spam limit is a first try at intentionally trying to prevent overly small micropayments like that. Bitcoin is practical for smaller transactions than are practical with existing payment methods. Small enough to include what you might call the top of the micropayment range. But it doesn't claim to be practical for arbitrarily small micropayments.

&gt;Forgot to add the good part about micropayments. While I don't think Bitcoin is practical for smaller micropayments right now, it will eventually be as storage and bandwidth costs continue to fall. If Bitcoin catches on on a big scale, it may already be the case by that time. Another way they can become more practical is if I implement client-only mode and the number of network nodes consolidates into a smaller number of professional server farms. **Whatever size micropayments you need will eventually be practical. I think in 5 or 10 years, the bandwidth and storage will seem trivial.**

http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/quotes/micropayments/

Which was said in August 2010, when 1 BTC was worth $0.05, meaning Bitcoin was designed for $0.0005 payments, and by now, even lower than that. Right now, 1 Satoshi of BTC is worth $0.000066, btw.

I'm tired of all you Core apologists saying it wasn't designed for micropayments, it can't scale, etc.

It can scale. Even Satoshi said it can scale:

&gt;The existing Visa credit card network processes about 15 million Internet purchases per day worldwide.  Bitcoin can already scale much larger than that with existing hardware for a fraction of the cost.  It never really hits a scale ceiling.  If you're interested, I can go over the ways it would cope with extreme size.

&gt;By Moore's Law, we can expect hardware speed to be 10 times faster in 5 years and 100 times faster in 10.  Even if Bitcoin grows at crazy adoption rates, I think computer speeds will stay ahead of the number of transactions.

The odds of RHM finding a block that orphans the SM chain = a &gt; 0

The odds of RHM finding a block that orphans an SM chain given x attempts = xa &gt; 0

The odds of RHM disrupting an SM attack given the entire life of the chain = x becomes infinite = xa approaches 1

Any event, no matter how improbable, is inevitable given enough attempts.

"With BTC you are currently taxed on a long term and short term gain/loss basis. Essentially if you hold BTC for more than 1 year you will be taxed based on a long term basis. Long term tax can go up to 20% and short term up to 39% if I remember correctly. Whether or not you get taxed this much depends what tax bracket you fall under. Here, the higher tax bracket you are in you get taxed less. If OP made any transaction with BTC  that he owned for less then one year then he will get taxed based on short term basis.  

From personal experience short term gain tax on crypto is the fucking worst. They should really change how they tax btc on short term gains. Also just as a tip, make sure you contact your bank before cashing out anything related to crypto making sure you don't have to pay some ridiculous fee or to find out if they will even accept any crypto related funds. You also have to take into consideration your state tax.

ETH is a different case since ETH was essentially an ICO and the SEC is still trying to figure that out, so I don't know if it will get taxed differently. Probably will by the looks of it. I don't own any ETH so I wouldn't really be able to tell you much more

Also please just contact a professional. 

Edit: just to clarify. By holding BTC you essentially cannot make any transaction  if you do not want to get taxed based on short term gains. If you buy 1 BTC now make any kind of transaction with it 5 minutes later you get taxed based on short term gains. If you hold and don't touch your btc for 1 year or more then you get taxed long term.

Yes, you made *many* baseless and false accusations, and you *did* brag about how you were deliberately trying to waste my time. This isn't something to be proud of, this is something to be *ashamed* and *embarrassed* by.

&gt;Thieflar allowed me to demonstrate why Creationists, 9/11 Truthers, and Thieflar are simply not worth anyone's time.

This is a total non sequitur (yet another logical fallacy). You can't make it through a single comment without resorting to lies and logical fallacies.

Again, all that I've said is that [Roger Ver is a liar](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/87t3ot/delicious_proof_that_roger_employs_sockpuppets/dwh4n51/), which anyone can see for themselves by taking a look over the many proven lies he has told.

Of course, the *other* option is to close your eyes and refuse to look at the facts, as JustSomeBadAdvice has done here. You can always throw in a string of fallacies to embarrass yourself extra, if you're feeling saucy.

&gt;More insults and doubling down on ignoring the meaning of things like ""reference"", ""refer to"", and ""image of"".

"To your first point, yes bitcoin survives if its banned in India. But to those Indians it now only has value as a black market commodity. Iran banning the USD isn't the same because it was never intended to be thier currency. Its the US's. In fact the US generally doesn't like it when other countries peg their currency to the dollar.

""The monetary policy for bitcoin is very clear there are 21 million and that’s it""

That's not a policy, that just a set artificial scarcity. A policy would be something like ""We intend to maintain the supply of bitcoin at such a level that common consumer transactions do not fall below the minimum transaction size"" But for the reasons you said above, that can't exist. You have to get the majority to agree to every change.

""The volatility argument against crypto has zero basis."" When Bitcoin's value over the last year went up to over 10x is starting price and then fall 3x from there just because its expensive to transfer between other currencies, this isn't going to go anywhere useful.

"Well, it makes sense- make it easy for people to buy and/or include in their broader portfolio, and THEY WILL DO IT. I know tons of people that want to buy ETH/OMG/tokens, etc. but only want to do it through a broker (they don’t want the hassle of storing on a Ledger, making anon account on Kucoin/Binance/whatever) and they don’t trust themselves to keep it safe from hackers. 

I totally understand this, as I wouldn’t trust myself to hold thousands of dollars of gold personally at my house, but what if I still want to add it to my portfolio? Luckily, I can pay for contracts for gold and let the companies handle the actual storage and auditing of my supply via major companies, but it’s still not so easy with Eth/BTC/tokens for MOST people.

It’s going to be getting easier as time goes on. Inevitably market forces WANT to take advantage of the growing interest in crypto, so I think next bull run is going to be MASSIVE as companies/exchanges make it easier and easier to buy contracts to interact with crypto assets.

"PoWH3D isn't a whole lot different from the other coins tons of people invest into - it's just up front about it being inherently worthless and only deriving value by the fact of people buying into it. Most other coins in crypto have no inherent value and bagholders will lose out when people stop buying.

Personally I think it's a cool game - I wouldn't put a lot into it - but it's fun to see a kind of meme on the social dynamics in the market. Just yesterday there was lots of ddossing of the website, fudding about the contract, and tons of clones popping up which crashed the price and it is now rebounding a bit. If you look at it, some sellers made some money if they timed it right, but with the buy/sell fees its really hard to trade at a profit. Meanwhile, the holders received dividends on a lot of volume but they lost more in token value - so if the price returns to the high they will see big gains if not they will see losses.

I totally get hating on pyramids and ponzis preying on unsuspecting people but I really don't see the problem when we are all aware of the risks and doing it for fun. That's not to say some of these promoters haven't misrepresented how it works - and that's always a problem we have to try to deal with by informing people.

"With governments and its citizens the incentive has always been obligation in exchange for asset (living in the society we accept to join). The citizen agrees to be a part of the collective and reaps a list of benefits and obligations that should not be confused for absolute freedom. If blockchain has interest to collectives they can use the power to direct obligation (the circulation of money) to make it happen. Since so much of what blockchain can do is about securely ledgering I do see utility value to that for an entity that is tasked to maintain the rule of law (contracts). If you want a futuristic example of how it could be useful I would suggest looking into things like materials passports. Basically anything we would want to record and manage benefits from having secure chains of ownership that we can use to apply fair costs to. Its a way to potentially deal with economic externalities that we today don't worry about, like pollution.

I recognize in one of your arguments something that I have seen said about energy conservation, that if we could only get every individual pulling in the same direction we could achieve what mandated collective action could. I see that as problematic with something like Bitcoin, because it is more suited for a hierarchical system. An ideal currency, to me at least, loses its value in such a way that hoarding isn't that good a proposition. Flow is what is best.

The issuance of tokens is something we have solved with fiat money. It can be sourced by simple double entry bookkeeping and it can be retired by having it nullify its counterpart in obligation. It doesn't need energy or effort to have to turn to someone to mine something into being by doing work to justify it to anyone. There's a supreme elegance to how we have things now.  The whole decentralized network angle is something that we will likely be able to duplicate with a few quantum computers. Of course, that also limits robustness because of risks.

If you love your country and what it stands for there is in that enough to get people in line with a cause. From my life experience rallying a lot of people into the same corner really just takes a very good PR effort. People can be convinced to even sacrifice themselves entirely for a bad cause. The problem with money is that so many attribute the problems we have to the objective nature of it when it really is entirely a game of overseeing the mode of economic production with a political sphere in order to generate the well being that gives us societal trust. America loved itself when money was flowing more equally in the 1950s. You could have asked a lot of the population and received it for the level of general well being there was (it wasn't that for all races, obviously).

Personally, I prefer low tech and robustness for money. I have said it before here, and I will say it again, that if we did have a crypto currency backed by government in place there would be such a desire for a low tech portable version of money that people would pay a utility premium for such a token. We would have a reverse Bitcoin trend where very good arguments would appear to have us pay for exactly what we have now (currently with no exchange premium attached to it).

In all of this there are embedded energy questions. What ultimately is in our best interest is to find a way to exchange that occasions the least amount of wasted energy. That's not totally evident at first glance when you consider how much energy goes into processing technology required materials. Everyone holding a cell phone has a huge cost in terms of how much high grade silicon needs to be processed and the need for networks that have maintenance requirements. We probably should not put into place a system of money with a huge technological component. I suspect that's going to really irk the people that love technology. The game these days is to find a way to seriously cut our energy demand on this globe because we still entirely caught up in 1880s methods of energy production. The world is still largely powered by coal and oil.",1523030444

"&gt; I'd have to simulate a maximum reorg length to see how much of a difference it makes.

No need, you can use the average maximum reorg from multiple simulations (after a bunch of runs, I get about 72).

&gt; How could you reliably tell where the blocks are coming from?

A reorg is self-evident. It doesn't matter where it comes *from*, just that it comes and it is long enough to alert (6 blocks would be plenty sufficient).

&gt; Nope, it would take a majority of HMs, at least.

Wrong. If one HM rejects a reorg and successfully builds against it, all other HMs will honor the rogue HM's longest chain and the SM loses. That HM could have just 5% of the hashpower and the whole equation gets thrown into chaos for the SM.

&gt; It's how bitcoin is defined to work. 

There are social limitations to this. There could be, right now, a massive mining farm that is not visibly mining because it is attempting to reorg *the entire Bitcoin blockchain from block zero*. It could have more than double the entire Bitcoin blockchain's participating hashpower and could produce a chain that is longer than Bitcoin's.

No participant in Bitcoin will accept that reorg when it is published. It is, however, by bitcoin's raw definition, the longest valid chain.",1523030388

"&gt;&amp;gt;You fail to mention that bitcoin core fork away form the original design.
&amp;gt;No particular version is the « original »

&gt;Then your argument is both illogical and meaningless beyond the deluded members of this minority ~~tribe~~ cult if it abandons the broadly established conventions of open source software development in favor of some vague notion that Bitcoin is just some nebulous idea un- associated with a very specific implementation which evolves through consensus.

Interesting maybe you can quote the white paper when the 1MB role is described as to create « digital gold/store of value »?

Or maybe some Satoshi post maybe?

&gt;&amp;gt;Using limited capacity as a permanent economic characteristics was the departure from the original vision...

&gt;More absurd and illogical assertions. Your claim that *not* changing (yet) is a ""departure"" is ridiculous. 

Yet it is, leaving that capacity changed the characteristics of Bitcoin.

It was maint to be removed but a small group fought hard to keep it. (Good old: create the problem, sell the solution)

&gt;There was never.. ever... *anywhere*, in any ""original vision"" any plan or requirement to increase block size by X on Y date or by Z block height, 

There was no block limit at all.

&gt;and no *minority* has the right (or ability) to dictate any such change to the rest of the network. 

Projecting much?

It is exactly what the core team have done.

Very easy to prevent consensus on a change and censorship have helped a lot.

(Censorship alone is a proof that small blocker are minority... otherwise there will be no need for it)

&gt;&amp;gt;It took an HF for Bitcoin to recover its characteristics.

&gt;No, it took a HF for a chain which is separate from Bitcoin to emerge which suited the desires of a minority.     

And that chain recover the original characteristics of Bitcoin.

&gt;&amp;gt;BTC is now doing something different.. nobody really know.. some kind of store of value (that dropped 75% in three month) digital gold (ponzi)...

&gt;If you regard such price volatility as validation or repudiation of changes to the code then a more relevant observation is the 500% price increase on the main chain after Segwit was implemented, vs the 75% decrease since the ATH. Besides, while the fiat value of BTC has declined in the last quarter the fiat value of BCH has declined more in the same 3 month period from 0.1 to 0.09. If you think BCH is succeeding then BTC is succeeding more. If you think BTC is failing BCH is failing more.

As all small blocker you only metrics of success is price, another characteristics of Ponzi schemes..

&gt;Don't expect me to simplify this to your understanding:       
https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#getchaintips

This is not soft fork detection.

&gt;&amp;gt;So such block (with one tx max) would not break consensus.

&gt;Blocks with 0 transactions do not break consensus. 

&gt;&amp;gt;and what if the miner got majority and the soft fork activated?

&gt;I don't know. Go get a majority of hash power and give it a try. 

Well by your definition it will be bitcoin.

Because somehow any restrictive change of the protocol is guaranteed to be bitcoin. Economics characteristics doesn’t matter somehow any restrictive is ok.

So a one tx per block currency will still be Bitcoin (can you imagine the amout of decentralisation?? Why don’t you guys do that?)

&gt;&amp;gt;The problem any parameters can be changed via SF. Just use the segwit trick, hide data to old nodes and go on. Meaning that bitcoin can transform into everything and yet remain bitcoin somehow, with no respect to the original experiment, convinient.

&gt;Nope. Some parameters such as POW algo and block size require HFs. 

Segwit just increased block size via SF didn’t you forget already?

&gt;Any SF must still respect older rules. 

Easy just hide the data to old nodes, ala segwit.

&gt;You *really* need to upgrade your technical understanding of how this all works. 

Really?

You currency just soft forked a block size increase and you say it is impossible...

&gt;Repeating the misinformation and basing your arguments on the delusions which has been spread in this sub will never work in the wider world.     

No misinformation, one fork stick to the original characteristics (BCH) another is trying something else (BTC)

Easy, I don’t know why you guys are so bitter about it.

It was the the whole reason segwit was pushed so hard, « Bitcoin is fundamentaly broken » and need deep change (restricting capacity and unproven second layer solutions)

Why those who really believe in the project can’t do all they can to recover Bitcoin? It is you guys choice to change it, we tried to compromise, many times..
 
Somehow just after the split the narrative change again and BTC is the original Bitcoin? So broken or not?

&gt;&amp;gt;Funny that he reply with a post including the code to remove like a non-event (and made numerous post on bitcoin scaling with massive blocks)

&gt;And since then other and better ideas have emerged and are being tried before resorting to such crude solutions with well known downsides. 

Not without deep economics and incentives change (and with relying on unproven tech)

&gt;&amp;gt;Not really, Bitcoin has been victims of a social attack, it is now stripped of his name and network effect and has restart from scratch.. but I am glad the experiment can continue.

&gt;Oh Bitcoin is certainly under social attack, we just seem to differ on which branch is trying to steal the name and network effect. 

Protip: see which side use censorship.

&gt; In just one week Round 1 of the Pre-ICO i.e. 300,000 dietbtcoins were sold out by Pablo Escobar&amp;#039;s biological brother Roberto De Jesus Escobar Gaviria and Round 2 is now live on the website at a discounted price of only $3.50 per coin.

&gt; &amp;quot;My coin will sell out completely, of course. All of my early followers will thank me in the end. When my coin becomes very valuable, it will. When you wait, you lose. I do what I say. I am a man of action. I created dietbitcoin for the people.&amp;quot; - Roberto Escobar, Founder of Escobar Inc. Having made over $100 billion dollar in his career, Roberto Escobar alongside Pablo Escobar belong among one of the most successful businessmen in history.

&gt; &amp;quot;Everyone should listen to these news, go to the website and buy as many dietbitcoin&amp;#039;s as you can afford, the value will be very high as we are identical in numbers to Bitcoin, except we are 2000 times cheaper right now&amp;quot; - Daniel Reitberg, Chief Operating Officer of Escobar Inc. &amp;quot;Why would anyone on the planet buy bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency where there is no real team behind it? Our team of staff at Escobar Inc are committed to support the cryptocurrency dietbitcoin fully and are managing the day-to-day operations of this new currency.&amp;quot; - Escobar Inc Chief Executive Officer, Olof Gustafsson.

Web 2.0 refers to World Wide Web websites that emphasize user-generated content, usability (ease of use, even by non-experts), and interoperability (this means that a website can work well with other products, systems, and devices) for end users. The term was popularized by Tim O'Reilly and Dale Dougherty at the O'Reilly Media Web 2.0 Conference in late 2004, though it was coined by Darcy DiNucci in 1999. Web 2.0 does not refer to an update to any technical specification, but to changes in the way Web pages are designed and used.

A Web 2.0 website may allow users to interact and collaborate with each other in a social media dialogue as creators of user-generated content in a virtual community, in contrast to the first generation of Web 1.0-era websites where people were limited to the passive viewing of content.

"&gt; Ansible, practical faster-than-light secure 0-conf transactions for Bitcoin

&gt; Abstract: The Ansible is a peer-to-peer pre-consensus signal that, by itself, makes 0-conf transactions secure. The Ansible is a self-fulfilling prophecy because making it so aligns with the economic interests of the miners who have to remain competitive. The Ansible confers two seemingly counterintuitive properties to the Nakamoto consensus. First, securing 0-conf transactions do not require any kind of retaliation against Byzantine miners, thus no change to the Nakamoto consensus. Second, 0-conf transactions can be secured with arbitrarily low latencies on earth, despite the fact that this proposition appears to violate the speed of light. The Ansible perspective clarifies why larger and infrequent blocks are actually highly desirable to secure 0-conf transactions.

For exchange coins, look into Gibraltar Blockchain Exchange, a subsidiary of Gibraltar Stock Exchange.  Their exchange token is Rock Token (RKT).  Eventually RKT will be preferred currency for GBX and GSX; offer early access to their platformed ICOs.  Trading fees, listing fees, settlement, etc.  

One thing that stands out is the fact that most of their investors in their token sale were industry.  Some big partners and adopters including Kyber Network, Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, Digix DAO, QUOINE.  

They have full regulatory compliance in Gibraltar, best practices, etc.  

Eventually they will offer tokenized securities on GSX, and RKT can be used to pay for such items.  GBX focuses on utility, while GSX will focus on security (as in SEC).  We can expect to see order book markets for mainstay cryptos like BTC, ETH, etc.

"&gt; Several months ago it was Roger Ver. Now it seems to be Craig Wright.

Roger is a legitimately contraversial figure. He clearly sits at the extra “big L” Libertarian end of the spectrum, and he’s done certain poorly thought through things in his extensive history in the Bitcoin industry.

Craig’s only notable contribution in his 3 year involvement has been falsely claiming credit for having invested Bitcoin, then getting caught. Offline he has no real world supporters. Just a well-funded sponsorship company and people who feel like they have to tolerate him.

Drawing comparisons between the two is ridiculous.",1523029045
"You mean like India just banned bitcoin and China is on their way? Unless it’s banned every where then it still survives. Any fiat is just as vulnerable to the law (made by someone with bigger guns), crypto and fiat have the same vulnerability in that respect. India recently banned large denomination physical fiat currency. Iran just banned the USD. It’s hardly immune from this.

Yes there are many ways of enforcing the law, but fundamentally all those ways are eventually enforced by weapons. Sure u can send the police, u can fine people, economic sanctions, but ultimately u are enforcing it with bigger guns (eg swat teams, nukes etc). See North Korea or the second world war as an example (conquered Japanese territories were using Japanese currency until the bigger guns stopped that, North Korea is basically ignoring the us institutions and us law and enforcement and they can because they have big guns/nukes). For the guy on the street, he can ignore the laws if he wants, u can send him fines and nasty words but ultimately the only thing keeping him in his place is that eventually the govt will send someone with a bigger gun than his to enforce it (usually the police).

The monetary policy for bitcoin is very clear there are 21 million and that’s it, any changes have to be agreed by 51% of the miners. Bitcoin is deflationary but not all crypto is. There are cryptos that are inflationary like the USD. There are even cryptos that are tied to the usd. Hodl is more relevant for deflationary cryptos. That really comes down to the monetary policy of the individual crypto.

Iran in fact is moving towards its currency being crypto. Chile has basically already done it with petroleum dollars. These crypto are already backed by guns and government institutions. Really the only difference between these crypto and fiat is the implementation technology. 

As far as intrinsic value and value vanishing, both fiat and crypto have similar vulnerabilities. Though it could be argued that crypto at scale actually is a bit more resilient than fiat because for decentralised crypto you can’t just take out one entity to stop it, you have to take out all of them.

lacking perspective on volatility? Just look at the fx rate data. The major fiat currencies are so volatile that financial institutions have to pass on large fx spreads to consumers. The volatility of fiat is actually one of the reasons for crypto and why international transfers in fiat are so expensive. It’s also one reason why most major banks are evaluating it in some way or another. The volatility argument against crypto has zero basis.",1523029043

"&gt; If that still isn't enough to dissuade you, understand that there may be no hope for you, and maybe you just like losing your money, because if you don't know what ""V3"" stands for, it means version 3, so the last 2 have clearly went bust already, and all these people have already lost all their money.

The V3 stands for the fact that his is the third generation of the contract. The previous two were a complete joke and not even coded properly. This one has been rewritten from scratch and went through multiple audits. It has reached a total of almost 20k ETH, enough incentive for hackers to hack **IF** it was hackable.

&gt; Oh, and one last point, when, because it will go down, Proof of Weak Hands does exit scam, I fear the price of Ethereum is going to be destroyed in the process, because you can obviously tell already that the POWH3D smart contract is already killing the price.

As mentioned by many others, there is not exit scam possible. **Read the code.** Can you please elaborate on how PoWH currently is tanking the price of ETH? What I'm seeing is that PoWH is the only coin up 100% in the recent weeks in this blood bath of the entire crypto sphere. Because you can only get P3D with ETH, and there currently is incentive to get P3D (%rise = demand), does it not make sense that P3D is saving the ETH price as of now? I can state that [PoWH is currently the #1 dApp](https://dappradar.com/) on the Ethereum network [consuming up to 5% of the GAS used on the network](https://gyazo.com/64d6259c7e0167ca8f41821764e64728).

The concept of decentralization is not something you can communicate easily, it requires some effort but it's doable. 

Cryptocurrencies, however, is really hard to explain. I am not talking about explaining how it works but even how to use it or why to use it. People have a hard time trusting digital world and now you come and say all your assets will be digitized and you won't have anything physical (maybe a hard wallet) to hold. That's just too radical. Without breaking that habit first I think you would have a hard time explaining the difference between ""a more centralized crypto-currency or a more decentralized crypto-currency"".

There is just a huge gap between people who contribute to these type of discussions on reddit and people who actually suffer the most from centralized government fiat. The adoption would be quite hard for them. I think it might even require new generations to really adopt cryptocurrencies.

"This is a question I had when I first discovered Bitcoin.

Money is market that favors a natural monopoly.  If you look at examples of money and how people use it, a society will always tend to favor one currency.  This is because there is no benefit to having competing currencies and there is an opportunity cost for holding currency at the expense of others.  That is, whatever amount you own in gold is that much less that you can own in silver.

You may be thinking that Gold and Silver are examples of two currencies co-existing in the same market equilibrium, but this is not the case.  The value of all gold is worth about 96% of the gold/silver market leaving only 4% for silver.  Of that 4%, some of that is due to silver's non-monetary value.  I suspect the remaining value is largely due to gold's inability to handle small transactions creating a niche market for silver. 

As to how I know Bitcoin won't be taking over, the network effect(S)-and plural because there are MANY are very strong.  Most notably Bitcoin has more demand and willingness to hoard it (liquidity).  For another currency to take over, would require economic consensus to shift, and consensus is not an easy thing to change.  Imagine it as a very very very large wall.

This wall *can* be scaled if a money has superior monetary properties, as is currently the case with Bitcoin gaining vs US Dollars and Gold, but in the absence of LARGE advantage in monetary properties, it is impossible to overcome the network lead Bitcoin has.

This is a very big part of why ARK is one of the few coins I actually bother to accumulate, all its other perks aside.  It's so easy to 'buy the dip' on ARK; even if the floor falls through and it goes down further, I can set aside these coins to make roughly 10% annually.  10% isn't going to excite those familiar with last fall's gains, but any traditional investor can truly appreciate those kinds of returns.  

I still trade a lot of ARK back and forth, but ARK is one of the coins that I take my profits in 'free coins' rather than BTC, and a coin that I don't mind running away from me here in Q1; I'm confident it'll return to previous levels and I'll take my dividends while I wait.",1523027844

"Good, I'm happy to see my comment (which I deleted after 30 minutes) made it to your group chat with Emin and Peter. 

What I know is that the bitcoin network is not a mesh. 

That miners are not a loosely connected network as Emin claims in his paper.

I also know that on paper the model stands, but if and only if HM don't react at all even though every other blocks starts getting orphaned all of a sudden. Honest, doesn't mean stupid. 

And then even after the difficulty adjustment plenty of blocks still get orphaned. So 3 possible outcomes for HM:

1) HM decreases the hashpower because he can't pay the bills. SM becomes a majority now. 

2) HM invests even more hashpower because he knows that SM cannot grow in the early stages. Then again SM starts losing even more money because alfa &lt; 0.3

3) HM neither decreases nor increases his hashrate, but the network identifies and shuns out of the network all mining nodes propagating N'-(N'+1) chains that orphan N blocks. 

There is no way SM can survive. 

If Emin wasn't such an asshole I would be more understanding and say that it was normal at the time when the paper was written to be confused about bitcoin network topology. Since Emin is an asshole and asking for it by trying to talk down people by resorting to authority, I'll say that Emin is the poster boy of the academic bubble era we live in. It is unforgivable for a Cornell professor who even likes to resort to authority to write in a peer reviewed paper that:

1) bitcoin miners are a loosely connected network

2) that after HM mines block N SM releases block N' and the chances of it getting included are like the toss of a coin. 

The times when you can win an argument by saying ""I'm a cornell professor"" are long gone, for at least since the internet has been around. Emin's mindset is stuck in the ottoman empire era where people sat all day smoking nargile, drinking tea and lived off taxes from the provinces. Roll up your sleeves and work or stfu. SM is BS. Can't happen. He knows it and that's why he is so butthurt and resorts to bazaar talk everytime someone points out it works only on paper assuming that HM don't react.",1523027544

Miners can't keep selling forever though. At some point they'll have to either stop mining, hodl until prices increase again or spend what they earn on other goods.

*  There is no exit scam possible in this contract.

Here is a complete code review of the smart contract solidity code.

If OP was smarter, he would have a look at the code himself and realize that there are no functions in the contract that make an exit-scam possible.
The website of the coin is merely a way to interact with the smart contract. There are dozens of other backup websites available that you can use to interact with the smart contract - or:

You can just use MyEtherWallet or Metamask to send transactions to the contract without using any 'official' PoWH3D frontend.

Metcalfe's law states the effect of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n2). First formulated in this form by George Gilder in 1993, and attributed to Robert Metcalfe in regard to Ethernet, Metcalfe's law was originally presented, c. 1980, not in terms of users, but rather of ""compatible communicating devices"" (for example, fax machines, telephones, etc.). Only later with the globalization of the Internet did this law carry over to users and networks as its original intent was to describe Ethernet purchases and connections.

"&gt;You fail to mention that bitcoin core fork away form the original design.
&gt;No particular version is the « original »

Then your argument is both illogical and meaningless beyond the deluded members of this minority ~~tribe~~ cult if it abandons the broadly established conventions of open source software development in favor of some vague notion that Bitcoin is just some nebulous idea un- associated with a very specific implementation which evolves through consensus.

&gt;Using limited capacity as a permanent economic characteristics was the departure from the original vision...

More absurd and illogical assertions. Your claim that *not* changing (yet) is a ""departure"" is ridiculous. There was never.. ever... *anywhere*, in any ""original vision"" any plan or requirement to increase block size by X on Y date or by Z block height, and no *minority* has the right (or ability) to dictate any such change to the rest of the network. Moreover, ""not now"" or ""not yet"" **is not** ""permanent"", it's just the present state.      

&gt;It took an HF for Bitcoin to recover its characteristics.

No, it took a HF for a chain which is separate from Bitcoin to emerge which suited the desires of a minority.     

&gt;BTC is now doing something different.. nobody really know.. some kind of store of value (that dropped 75% in three month) digital gold (ponzi)...

If you regard such price volatility as validation or repudiation of changes to the code then a more relevant observation is the 500% price increase on the main chain after Segwit was implemented, vs the 75% decrease since the ATH. Besides, while the fiat value of BTC has declined in the last quarter the fiat value of BCH has declined more in the same 3 month period from 0.1 to 0.09. If you think BCH is succeeding then BTC is succeeding more. If you think BTC is failing BCH is failing more.

&gt;How?

Don't expect me to simplify this to your understanding:       
https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#getchaintips

&gt;So such block (with one tx max) would not break consensus.

Blocks with 0 transactions do not break consensus. 

&gt;and what if the miner got majority and the soft fork activated?

I don't know. Go get a majority of hash power and give it a try. 

&gt;The problem any parameters can be changed via SF. Just use the segwit trick, hide data to old nodes and go on. Meaning that bitcoin can transform into everything and yet remain bitcoin somehow, with no respect to the original experiment, convinient.

Nope. Some parameters such as POW algo and block size require HFs. Any SF must still respect older rules. You *really* need to upgrade your technical understanding of how this all works. Repeating the misinformation and basing your arguments on the delusions which has been spread in this sub will never work in the wider world.     

&gt;BCH/BTC are incompatible chain, who has the longest chain dont matter.

That's what I'm trying to tell you. 

&gt;Funny that he reply with a post including the code to remove like a non-event (and made numerous post on bitcoin scaling with massive blocks)

And since then other and better ideas have emerged and are being tried before resorting to such crude solutions with well known downsides. 

&gt;Not really, Bitcoin has been victims of a social attack, it is now stripped of his name and network effect and has restart from scratch.. but I am glad the experiment can continue.

Oh Bitcoin is certainly under social attack, we just seem to differ on which branch is trying to steal the name and network effect. Good luck with your experiment. ",1523025560
"Will you at any point accept that perhaps this is just the market talking and not effects of censorship and deceit?

Perhaps having a very secure, decentralized and censorship resistant base layer that has proven incredibly difficult to change and facilitates a SoV/digital gold use case (with payment infrastructure being built on layers above) is what the market is valuing above the ability to do cheap on-chain transactions.

It's not like Roger and co. haven't been on a huge PR campaign and reached tons of people through tons of media appearances, conferences, Bitcoin.com, @bitcoin (not sure if Roger controls this) and let everyone know how he thinks BCH *is* Bitcoin.

Just like bitcointalk.com has become completely irrelevant, r/bitcoin seems to become less relevant over time.

Will you still blame censorship and evil Blockstream guys if BCH goes continues it downward trend to let's say .05 or even .01 BTC many months from now as a result of little real demand for using it in commerce?

Nothing wrong with having a preference for on-chain scaling or feeling that things were moving too slowly on BTC, but at some point, you got to get beyond the ""Blockstream and Bitcoin Core are the reason for everything that doesn't go after my head"".

I was initially a big fan of the fork and the prospect of getting to see different scaling approaches duke it out in the wild, but it has become more of a never ending presidential election with everyone slinging mud at the opposing side and interpreting everything as a huge victory for the home team and damning exposure of the opposing one.",1523025548

The law was named in 1860 by Henry Dunning Macleod, after Sir Thomas Gresham (1519–1579), who was an English financier during the Tudor dynasty. However, there are numerous predecessors.

"Tether's market cap represents money that has entered the marketplace, has temporarily exited and is waiting to jump back in... waiting for the bottom. People who left for good have left into Fiat, not into tether. People who left into tether are ready and eager to jump back in. Due to it's stablecoin nature, USDT market cap is one of the only coins whose marketcap actually legit represents how much money is in the pile. 

It's been estimated that new money entering the crypto space has an approximate 50x magnification factor on changing price. I.e. 1B USD entering will typically cause a 50B USD increase in market cap. 

Remember, market cap is simply last price x circulating supply. Increasing buy pressure (or sell pressure) impacts price, not only by crushing through the order books, but by making people see that someone is willing to pay more for an asset they want to buy, and they then adjust their opinion of it. 

This has an extreme snowball effect either way. Look at how sell pressure has convinced many people that BTC is going to zero. Or in December, buy pressure convinced people that BTC was going to $1M per coin by 2020. 

Right now, many people think BTC is going to zero, but half the reason for that is that everyone sitting in Tether financially benefit from BTC falling further. You don't think the people posting on this sub that crypto is dead have no financial incentive to convince you to sell? Of course they do, they are holding tether, waiting for you to sell, to drop price further so they make more money coming back in. They have the same incentive that I have, telling you that now is a good time to buy, because I've loaded up my bags on this pullback and am ready for the next boost. I'm not going to lie to you and tell you I have no financial incentive for the price to rise. I do. I'm loaded up and ready to go. I'm not missing the bottom. And the thing that's making me confident that there is going to be another bullrun is the sheer absurd size of the USDT market cap. This represents money that's going to cause a spark of buy pressure, like we've never seen before.

When the bull market comes and the tether people find their entry points, and FOMO starts kicking in, and outside money starts pouring back in, we're going back up. 

How far up? That's the question? When? That's the other side of it.

Is BTC and crypto dying though? Tether's marketcap says everything I need it to say... no fucking way in hell. There's a LOT of money, just waiting, watching, trying to time the bottom, frothing at the mouth, ready to jump back in.

If we go sideways for a little bit, and volume picks up for a few days, and tether people start buying in.... and prices rise and starts liquidating more and more shorts, that's your signal that we're going to start seeing Mr Bean train gifs.

If people were actually giving up on crypto, we wouldn't see Tether market cap where it is, because they would exit into fiat (like many have done). But no, we are seeing tether market cap rise and rise and rise. This is a huge positive sign, that people are afraid of the dip, but they believe in the tech, the market, and that there will be a bull market again. 

And you know what's an even bigger sign that the bottom is near?

Look at tether market cap over the last few weeks. It's pretty stable. What does that represent? That means that most people who have moved out to tether have done so. Nobody is stupid enough to tether up in this market right now. I'm pretty convinced that we are going to see buy pressure start to build up in the next few weeks, and the tether market cap is going to SLOWLY start to fall. Holy fuck, the moment you see that happen, you better get the fuck back in here, because we're taking off. 

The moment the first few pebbles are thrown back into the lake, we are going to see a snowball effect that is going to be massive. Likely bigger than anything we've seen before.

"""Dust"" means that you tried to create an output (coin) with too little value. So the transaction was rejected as invalid.

Each node sets its own dust limit, but it typically works out to 3x the minimum fee to get the transaction confirmed:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2unzen/what_is_bitcoins_dust_limit_precisely/

For a 1 satoshi/byte limit, that works out to 1209 satoshis for your transaction (403 bytes). Given that you have P2SH scripts (addresses that start with ""3"") and 3 output, this size looks reasonable.

Your first output's value is 500 satoshis, which  would be below the limit.

The fee is very high. Be sure you're using the latest version of Electrum. Setting the Fee at ~ 5-10 satoshis/byte (way less than your current 204 satoshis/byte) should get you quick confirmation under current conditions:

"Yes and here's why...

We all know how many shit ICOs were out there right? How did these get funded? People bought ETH, and traded ETH to gain the ICOs. The ETH went to these scamcoins.

Now, not all ICOs were scams, but likely 90% or more (probably more like 99%) were. And they have this pile of ETH. They can either develop a ""product"", or they can just say ""thanks for the ETH, peace out"", sell their ETH and keep all the money. 

Of course they will say they are using the money to ""hire"" and ""develop"" their ""product"", but in time people will forget about them.

So, we had this ICO boom, we had this ETH explosion from buy-pressure from people funding ICOs. Now we have sell pressure from ICO scamcoins liquidating ETH for whatever they can get.

That's almost done (opinion of course), so ETH is now massively oversold, and is an insanely strong buy.

I have no doubt that buying 400, 500, 600, even $700 ETH is going to look like a bad play 3 years from now. That should be your timeframe for investments (stop trying to make money overnight). 

ETH is insane investment opportunity right now. Sure some rank 500 coin may 100x, and ETH may only 10x. But that rank 500 coin could equally disappear, and I think of any investment in this space ETH has the most potential to still be here in 10 years (even more than BTC itself).",1523023206

The problem eth has been and is it wasn't built with the right vision as a enterprise platform as VB said you ain't build Uber on Eth which too me sounds retarded and shortsighted, in case he missed the last ten years you want Uber and Facebook and AirBnb all scaled out from your tech and so for Eth success was a result of being in the right place at the right time to be the  platform for ICO tokenization.

Ie Eth and ETC, that will become the norm which no fortune 500 company is going to go for they want stable boring reliable so they can make money.

"&gt; Trust in the solvency of banks did not reduce trust in the value of the dollar.

Because the dollar was pegged to gold.

The preference was clear: gold &gt; dollar &gt; deposit receipt.

You basically argue that ""people"" had ""wrong"" preferences. Saving over consumption, liquid assets over illiquid assets. I would argue the market would have cleared that eventually.

The only real problem, that you point out so pointedly, with reference to penny candies is divisibility. A technical issue that Bitcoin has overcome.

&gt; When you have 10% deflation then any productive investment that gets you less than 10% return on investment isn't worth the effort. If investing in a factory that employs 1000 people will only get you 9% return on investment, then why both employing all those people to produce goods and services when you can just do nothing and make more money?

"Central banks like the U.S.'s Federal Reserve determine money supply and interest rates, manipulating the value of fiat currencies. Often, they make decisions based on what's best for institutions (i.e. commercial and investment banks) rather than citizens. They also make mistakes (hyperinflation, deflation, poor timing, etc.) that can crash markets, ruin economies, and destroy all the hard-earned value that citizens have worked for and saved throughout their lives.

Bitcoin has a fixed supply, and it is decentralized and trustless, which protects it from the inflationary  manipulations (like quantitative easing) and interest-rate manipulations available to central banks via 'printed' fiat currencies. By design, this will help those that store their wealth/value in Bitcoin maintain that value, rather than lose it at the will of a central entity with ulterior motives (profiting systems and companies, rather than protecting citizens' stored value).

Your dollar loses value every day. It lost 10% of it's value last year, according to some metrics. You **have** to spend it (sell) to avoid losing your stored value. You can sell it for stocks, real-estate, or government debt, but you're pressured to put more of your money in those markets due to manipulation (inflation) than you otherwise would, and this encourages instability, and a lack of liquidity. In theory, if BTC were 100% adopted, it would increase in value slowly over time and become a more accurate representation of true value. You could put your savings in BTC, gain a return, and also keep liquidity that IRAs, bonds, and real-estate don't provide.

Now, how all of this *actually* plays out over the next 20-30 years is anyone's guess. But BTC was designed to protect against the major weaknesses threatening our financial system.",1523021965

&gt; Waning Influence of Regulatory Threats and Increased Bitcoin Adoption in Q2. According to Brian Kelly, the founder of Brian Kelly Capital, Bitcoin always comes good in Q2 based on its historical performance.

&gt; Dan Morehead, the CEO of Pantera Capital and a noted Bitcoin early adopter has remained bullish in his assertion that Bitcoin will come out of its present rut and begin to climb in the market.

&gt; In late 2017, when Bitcoin was in the midst of its spectacular run, Morehead predicted that Bitcoin could decline by up to 50 percent before recovering.

"The way the market worked out over Dec / Jan left a lot of people with a lot of money, and then they quickly lost it. Now, they are trapped into paying taxes on gains they no longer have, and many will be left no choice but to  completely cash out of crypto to even afford to pay what they owe.  At this point, most probably already have, but I am sure there are some last minute hold-outs hoping that the market will turn before the 17th. 

IMHO the whales know this, and have been feeding off of the little fish during the past few months.  It's called consolidation. While these poor folks are forced to sell, the whales are constantly buying. They are building up huge stacks of coins, all kinds.  They aren't doing this for shits and giggles.  

Zoom out on the charts, and look at the market cycles.  There is always a huge extended (months) dip before the big bull runs.  We have been in a slump for 3 months now.  Plenty of time for all the big players to accumulate enough.  If the market does go on a bull run shortly after the 17th, I don't think it will be a coincidence.

Because their is a finite amount of btc. The US treasury can print off as many 1$ bills as it wants. (inflation... Kinda),1523020593
"Nobody knows if ""it doesn't solve the scaling issues long term"". And I mean nobody, as in none of the so called ""experts"" in both BTC and BCH side know if that will happen or not. The whole argument is based on opinions. And when it comes to economy, there is no right or wrong answer if you look back in history.

As for ""scaling issues long term"", I don't think it's a good idea to blindly believe in moore's law and push the block size all the way up to 1GB without caution, but I do think that a block size going from 1MB to 4 to 8MB is really not much of an issue and definitely not something that should have caused the chain to split. Blockchain becoming 4 times larger won't automatically price out 99% of the world. It's a linear increase.

I think this is mostly why people are angry about the whole situation. Upgrading to 2MB (it was only 1MB increase for god's sake!) would have bought the developers a few years during which they could try to come up with more stable solution, which would have been better for all. You say it like if ""long term solution"" is all that matters, and ""postponing the problem"" is a bad thing, but it's not as simple as that.

If we had a ""short term"" tradeoff solution, the people working on the ""long term solution"" would have been able to work in more rational and cautious manner. But now that's not the case. You may or may not realize, but the multiple teams simultaneously working on lightning is very likely to be super stressed out because they all know--even though they don't say it out loud--the future of BTC relies entirely on the success of lightning. This is why these people just released half-baked software when they weren't fully ready. Also the competition among multiple teams is not helping either because they're all focused on PR to get traction for their own brand instead of trying to make BTC succeed. This is bad even if you are a BTC supporter. This irrationality will result in the developers making decisions that will compromise decentralization over ""user experience"", and the users will also probably go along with it because they have so much stake in the coin. Then it's all downhill from there. I hope that doesn't happen, but my point is the whole ""sacrifice short term for long term"" decision may end up becoming the downfall of Bitcoin.",1523020587
My experience in Bitcoin is the best time to buy is when its correcting/below its last ATH.  There is no good reason to think this time is any different.  If I had any disposable income left i would at the very lest DCA right now on a weekly basis all the way up to 12-15k lets say. ,1523020500

"I think that the point was being made that a significant part of bitcoins system is a set circulating supply. Paper contracts (while there are arb spots that help to balance money) don't physically own a bitcoin. 

By buying actual bitcoin, you reduce circ supply which is real value if we beleive bitcoin has value. Buying a paper contract doesn't (itself, again arb is real, others in this subreddit can explain it better than I) actually influence scarcity so isn't valuable to the system even if we assume the system (bitcoin) has value.

"Don’t underestimate how clever this can get. 

Instead of $50 a game or completely F2P, imagine PUBG that cost the equivalent of 10 cents to play. It’s such a small amount that it’s effectively F2P. Winner of the match gets to keep $9, the other $1 goes to core developers and people running the servers (who are distributed like miners.) 

In a very real sense everyone can be a developer - in game items, maps, content etc can be designed by anyone, sold for the same in-game crypto, etc. It’ll be a way of funding the “mod” community that people will get on board with, not some central company extracting rent like Bethesda tried to do a few years back. 

It has to be a closed loop - the ICO raises funds by distributing the token players will need to play the game. Because it’s market tradeable this makes the players direct stakeholders in the success of the game. They’ll be financially and emotionally invested in its success, and have a strong incentive to market the game. Plus because the players are the funders, this will ensure that the game is designed to satisfy the player base, not extract maximum revenue from them. It is highly unlikely players will impose F2P, loot boxes or any other dark patterns upon themselves. It will simply make better games. 

And because it will obviously be open source, other “companies” will build upon the same code and data to create more games that can tie in on multiple levels with the same currency, item ecosystem etc. The possibilities here are extraordinary. ",1523018685

"There is no need of one currency, its just needed that the currencies get connected together without loosing money on switching between. 

In my mind the cryptospace will have thousands of diffrent currencies in it. And it doesnt matter if you hold BTC, Eth, NEO, ... 

As example you hold BTC and want to buy something, but the other part only accept Ether.
Over algorithmen behind you can pay with your BTC and they will be changed to ETH and the pther one recieves ETH.
But you as owner of BTC wont recognize that this shift has happend. 

This prinzip will work over all token via cross chain exchanges with apis included in a paymentsystem. But this paymentsystem has to be accepted by both parts.

So there will not be one single blockchain to rule them all. ",1523018166
"In the link you gave for c&amp;c arbitrage this example is given:

&gt;Example of Cash-and-Carry Arbitrage

&gt;Consider the following example of cash-and-carry-arbitrage. Assume an asset currently trades at $100, while the one-month futures contract is priced at $104. In addition, monthly carrying costs such as storage, insurance and financing costs for this asset amount to $3. In this case, the trader or arbitrageur would buy the asset (or open a long position in it) at $100, and simultaneously sell the one-month futures contract (i.e. initiate a short position in it) at $104. The trader would then hold or carry the asset until the expiration date of the futures contract, and **deliver the asset** against the contract, thereby ensuring an arbitrage or riskless profit of $1.

I don't think the above example applies to the current BTC CME/CBOE futures contracts as they are paper settled with no delivery requirement for actual bitcoins. I'm in no way well versed in financial products but I am highly skeptical that approval of the ProShares ETF would materially impact BTCs price like you believe. 

I believe that regulators and other officials are concerned that approval of a 'real ETF' like the Winkelvoss's which requires actual purchase and delivery of bitcoins has the potential of creating a huge BTC price spike with unknown consequences on the broader financial markets. ",1523018161

Because PayPal is a valid alternative to wire transfers, especially when you need to money in your bank account A.S.A.P. to pay for services that normally do not take Bitcoin (phone bills, rent, etc...).

&gt;Between how slow everything is

I don't honestly know what you're talking about, PayPal is instant. It's faster than Bitcoin. This is obviously because it's centralised and not trustless, but it is instant.

&gt;the fees

The fees are bad, but not terrible. ~£0.60 to send from a credit card and ~£0.10 to send from a debit card, assuming international. National, debit cards are free.

This I can't defend, their exchange rates are extremely poor. Circle has better exchange rates, and that's what I use for sending money to friends/family.

I admit that trust systems aren't as good as Bitcoin's trustless network, but in my experience I've only ever seen people with unverified accounts be locked. I'm not saying only that happens, but it's certainly a larger percentage.

"This is one of the most cringeworthy things I've ever seen.

Let's recap, shall we?

1) JustSomeBadAdvice claims that [Craig Wright being a liar is harming BCH through association](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89mcjd/my_csw_rant/dws2n2e/): ""Every time BCH doesn't cut off the bullshit and ignore the frauds, it becomes harder and harder for people to take BCH seriously. ¶ CSW is a dead weight around BCH's neck. If he can't correct the lies and stop the nonsense, BCH suffers by not cutting him loose.""

2) I [politely agreed with him](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89mcjd/my_csw_rant/dwscjg0/) and asked if he thought the same could be said for Roger Ver, who has [a long, well-documented, and proven history of being a liar, too](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/87t3ot/comment/dwh4n51).

3) JustSomeBadAdvice responds *immediately* with an insult and ad hominem: ""[I think you're a low effort troll and you're full of shit basically every time you open your mouth.](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89mcjd/my_csw_rant/dwslnsi/), abandoning any pretense of civility within one sentence. **Take note of this, if you want to have a good laugh later on.** Despite having the proof already provided to him, he says ""I haven't found any convincing proof of any lies that Roger told"" and then refuses to read the linked source which proves what I said (instead going for more vicious and unnecessary ad hominem attacks): ""If you think anyone with half a brain is going to actually dig through that steaming pile of garbage you linked, you're a moron.""

4) I once again [respond politely](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89mcjd/my_csw_rant/dwsqvd6/), pointing out that the proof was already provided and that I acknowledge his right to ignore it, explaining why it was brought up in the first place and reminding what the conversation was about and the relevance of the source provided.

5) JustSomeBadAdvice [reiterates that he is unwilling to read the source provided](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89mcjd/my_csw_rant/dwsy9da/), and then demands ""one solid example of what you believe shows what you are talking about?"" He says he is willing to discuss *one example only* (again, remember this, because it's about to pay off).

6) [I oblige](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89mcjd/my_csw_rant/dwt0ret/), picking out a single instance that is incontrovertibly a lie (and then adding in two ""honorable mentions"" that are worth pointing out, too).

7) JustSomeBadAdvice responds by saying ""[so you want to attack the guy as a complete fraud, not to mention the entire ecosystem and philosophical disagreement that lead to the first major fork of Bitcoin, simply because [he made] one [untrue] comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89mcjd/my_csw_rant/dwt5e1o/)?"" Notice that **he demanded me to single out one lie**, refusing to read the long list of other lies I had already provided proof of, and now he tries to mock the fact that I just singled out a single lie like he asked. He says ""that doesn't seem to be relevant to the vast array of fraud accusations made against Roger daily"" as if all I was able to do was find *one* example of Roger lying.

**As you can see, this is pretty comical, and it's pretty obvious what just happened.** He goes on to try to haphazardly and ineffectually defend the outright lie (throwing out a different ""desperate handwave"" than the actual approach Roger had tried to take in the episode). It falls flat.

8) I [explain what just happened](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89mcjd/my_csw_rant/dwu2rnj/), and why the ad hoc defense-attempt doesn't actually work. I (again) point out that there is a long list of other examples that he's deliberately refusing to acknowledge.

9) JustSomeBadAdvice *again* [refuses to read](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89mcjd/my_csw_rant/dwu3m61/) what has been explained to him: ""your post isn't even worth my time to read"". He appears to be under the impression that this strengthens his case, as amusing as that sounds.

10) I [point out what just happened](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89mcjd/my_csw_rant/dwu52mz/).

11) JustSomeBadAdvice [accuses me of gish galloping](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89mcjd/my_csw_rant/dwuak65/), despite the fact that I have only been presenting a single argument/claim this entire discussion.

12) [I point this out](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89mcjd/my_csw_rant/dwuc7ja/), and note that he is (ironically enough) being dishonest with this accusation.

13) He [again accuses me of gish galloping](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89mcjd/my_csw_rant/dwur8ui/), doubling down on the dishonest accusation despite the fact that it was just explained to him how it doesn't apply.

14) [I recap what has happened](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89mcjd/my_csw_rant/dwus0gk/), pointing out that his entire argument thus far has boiled down to *not reading what I write, contradicting himself, and making accusations that make no sense and have no basis in reality.*

15) JustSomeBadAdvice [ramps up the ad hominem attacks](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89mcjd/my_csw_rant/dwusji4/), repeatedly calling me names and throwing profanity into the mix. Funny note: he (seemingly accidentally, in an attempt to call me retarded) says that I am continually ""making my entire side of the debate look not-retarded"". 

16) [I point this out](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89mcjd/my_csw_rant/dwuu6gg/), also noting the irony of his attempt to mock ""spit[ting] out 15 pages of garbage and then make people waste 8 hours reading and debunking it"" when [he himself is a repeat offender](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/84ycgw/the_lightning_network_has_arrived/dvuslh6/) in this department, [and I actually *have* spent the time to debunk his pages-of-garbage](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7cwfm5/something_very_important_to_consider_about_bch/dttlpk5/). The irony is essentially going nuclear at this point.

17) He [resorts to an *argumentum ad populum* fallacy](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89mcjd/my_csw_rant/dwuw4d3/) in desperation.

18) I [point out the fact that this is not only fallacious, but inapplicable anyway](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89mcjd/my_csw_rant/dwv0o7h/).

19) He [doubles down on the fallacy](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89mcjd/my_csw_rant/dwv2emw/), tries to brag (again) about how he isn't reading what I write, and then (ironically enough) references *another* example where ""pages of garbage"" were [methodically debunked by me](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7eil12/evidence_that_the_mods_of_rbitcoin_may_have_been/dq5xrdi/).

"Zilliqa! If you are new to Zilliqa (ZIL), here's a quick introduction: 

Zilliqa will likely be the first blockchain with live on-chain transaction sharding, which gives them a high, near linearly increasing, throughput:[ 2488 tx/s in their internal testnet](https://blog.zilliqa.com/highlights-of-fresh-experimental-results-testnet-v0-5-f72bcaefd21b). Additionally, Zilliqa uses the smart contract language ""Scilla"", which is similar to Solidity, but safer, e.g. things like the parity hack would've been prevented when using Scilla.

Like Ethereum, it is a blockchain on which you can run smart contracts. However, it is designed in such a way, that it is linearly scalable with the number of nodes of the network. I. e., the more Zilliqa nodes there are, the faster the blockchain gets. With the number of nodes Ethereum has at the moment Zilliqa would be able to process 15 000 tx/s! In the long-run they will focus on blockchain interoperability and privacy as well. For instance, Amrit Kumar, the Crypto Lead published a paper about the traceability of Monero, which spurred discussion about the topic and resulted in proposals for fixes (https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~amrit/papers/monero-analysis.pdf). Another distinction to Ethereum is the previously mentioned smart contract language Scilla, which offers higher security.

The public testnet was launched a couple of days ago! **Currently processing 2000 tx/s, which will be increased as time goes on.** The mainnet is due in Q3 of this year. [Here's Zilliqa's near term roadmap.](https://i.imgur.com/63BLxLg.jpg)

Poe's law is an adage of Internet culture stating that, without a clear indicator of the author's intent, it is impossible to create a parody of extreme views so obviously exaggerated that it cannot be mistaken by some readers or viewers as a sincere expression of the parodied views.

"Bitcoin was created to work outside national currencies, which is a draw to people who don’t trust central banks, says Yermack.

Those who are hopeful about the rise of bitcoin may have noticed its popularity in countries like Zimbabwe and Venezuela, where it is being used as a major means of exchange when government-issued currencies have failed because of hyperinflation. Bitcoin and other means of exchange have become popular in these countries because transactions can be performed on cell phones, and their value is more stable than the hyper-inflated national currency.

But others believe that bitcoin is too riddled with problems to be the cryptocurrency upon which the future is built. First, it likely can’t be used on a national scale because of how few transactions per minute bitcoin supports. Bitcoin’s framework can only make seven transactions per second, says Ari Juels, computer science professor at Cornell University who studies cryptography and computer security. VISA’s credit card network, for comparison, can handle 65,000 transactions per second.

Issues of privacy also stop it from becoming the future of money, says Phillipa Ryan, commercial equity lawyer and lecturer at the University of Technology Sydney. “Bitcoin is problematic in that it provides too much privacy and not enough privacy,” says Juels. “Too much privacy in that it provides enough to give criminals the opportunity to perpetrate a lot of mischief, from ransomware to the Silk Road. Not enough in that transactions are actually traceable by pseudonym.”

Its value also fluctuates too much to provide a stable, functional currency. Unlike traditional currencies, which have a value that is set by the central banking system, the value of bitcoin is driven by speculation about its worth like a stock, says Yermack. So it doesn’t make the cut as a currency. “Traditionally, we think of money as a kind of means of exchange and a store of value,” says Harold James, an economic historian at Princeton. “[Bitcoin] is very good at the means of exchange, but not very good at the store of value.”",1523012083

A currency cannot have 0 inflation or deflation.

Bitcoin's sort of deflative by nature, which is not a good thing for a currency.

Let me put it in a perspective.

You have 500'000 $. You know your 500'000 $ will be worth less in two years.

Let's say that you're looking for a flat. There's a nice flat near your area that costs 500'000 $.

You can make two choices:

-a) buy it

-b) wait

Now, the b) scenario with an inflative currency is not wise (unless you invest it and have a return that beats inflation). As inflation will make your dollars worth less with time (and the same flat may cost 525'000 or be unavailable in two years) you're pressured to spend your 500'000$ now and get that flat.

The inflative nature of pretty much any currency is good for economy. In the end currencies are only a mean to trade goods and services. Knowing your money is worth less tomorrow makes you spend your money now and moves the economy. You'll get your flat. Who sold you the flat will maybe get a rare Ferrari, idk. The Ferrari owner may start a business.

Now, all of these things are way less likely to happen with a deflative currency.

As you know that your 500'000 might be worth more in two years you're invited to hoard it and wait, not to spend it. In two years the same flat may cost you 480'000 $ and you'd save 20'000$. But what happens in two years? That if you wait another two years you may pay for the same flat 455'000$.

This leads to you not spending your 500'000, the home owner won't get his Ferrari, the Ferrari owner won't have the cash to start the business.

Obviously the inflative nature of a currency has a bad side: if you're a saver and you don't want to spend your money you're gonna face the problem of your savings devaluing with time. You're pressured to either spend it or invest it. But investments not always turn well. So your savings may devalue even more.

Here a deflative currency shows its benefits: you know your currency won't be worth less tomorrow and you can sleep just fine.

But again a deflative currency won't really work as a currency. People are not encouraged to invest it, spend it. It cannot move an economy.

That's one of the problems I see in most cryptocurrencies. While I do understand the philosophy some of you have of a store of value is right, it also leads to: ""how can Bitcoin really function as a currency if hoarding and holding is promoted rather than spending""?

Shops that implemented Bitcoin payments did not see a real spike in sells except for the very few weeks from the news.

Why?

Because each and everybody is concerned with the fiat value and promotes a holding philosophy.

Yet, even without those memes and philosophy pretty much anybody can understand that the limited amount of Bitcoin does not promote spending it.

I think Satoshi was a great mathematician, yet I don't think he was a great economist. He couldn't be everything, and this subreddit has moved past his ideas for many things (block size, e.g.).

In the end I think that if Bitcoin had an acceptable inflative nature (2%/year) and a PoS (so holders and spenders can both have benefits) system instead of a PoW system Bitcoin's economics would've looked better.

I just can't see Bitcoin making a case for being a currency at any point. It's always gonna be a second layer of currency transmissions. I know some people argue that ""you will use Bitcoin for big payments"", but in the end, why would I, and why would the seller accept it if he's less likely to make many smaller payments?

At some point, as a community, we really do need to rethink the fundamentals of Bitcoin.

What I feel (or better, know) will happen tho, is yet more phylosophical wars that will lead to nothing.

In the end Network's stability derives from consensus, and it's pretty obvious we cannot reach consensus without yet other forks.

And since most people are concerned with Bitcoin-fiat price rather than using Bitcoins the same thing that keeps Bitcoin price high (it's store of value-ish nature) is the same thing that will prevent it from achieving anything (it's deflative nature).",1523011073

"Good points about the book. Everything you said is true, but from the perspective of the manufacturer. It costs them what it costs them to produce it, whether it be a physical book or DRM and distribution on an ebook. But we are talking about the consumer right? As a consumer, wouldn’t you say the primary valuation of a book is the information? That is why although all books can *cost* the same to produce, not all books sell the same amount. We are talking about valuations right? Which is usually determined by the buyer. What value does a product have for the buyer, which is what gives bitcoin a price.

Your last paragraph illustrates my other point, which is the usefulness of something can be magnified by the amount of participants, not that something is not useful at all. You’re using a bit of circular definition to say bitcoin or $10 is not useful unless you can convert it to something with inherent value. But inherent value is what we are trying to define.

Ultimately, it comes down to whether or not you think something that allows one to  store and transact value in a transparent, decentralized manner is defined as having inherent value. Seems like your definition always comes back to a physical good that you can touch, where as I’m trying to make the case for something that you cannot touch. Would you say this is correct? If not, is there something intangible that you think has inherent value? ",1523011008

"Thanks a lot for taking the time to write this! I now finally understand how the Blockstream-propaganda thing really worked. I am not sure if I can help you to understand why you are wrong - but I give it a try (but only one).

The reason why you can trust miners is that they have a clear incentive to act in the best interest which is aligned with the best interest of the system and the users. The party that keeps any miner ""in check"" are THE OTHER MINERS. Period. That´s why the only weakness in this system is the so-called 51%-attack: if the majority of miners would collaborate together.

And yes, it is the users that give Bitcoin value - so users are an important part of the ecosystem - but there is no special function for ""users who run non-mining nodes"". 

If this wouldn´t be the case, there would be a paragraph in the whitepaper that would say something like this: ""Bitcoin is quite safe, but as a last resort it would be good to have at least 1000 Rasberry-Pi-nodes, run by some dudes in their basement, to act as a moral police if there is an evil miner somewhere"".

Non-mining-nodes are pretty much useless for the network (sure they hold a copy of the blockchain, and more copies of the blockchain are better than fewer copies of the blockchain, but these are diminishing returns"".

And that´s why we had a chain split: users where unhappy with the user experience of bitcoin, miners where unhappy, so now we have two chains. At no point, the number of nodes that run software client (a) or (b) played a role in this. 

If it makes you feel happy, you can run a node. And you probably never need to upgrade your hard drive ever, because the number of transactions on Bitcoin Segwit will probably go down and will never recover. ",1523010907

The miners kept blocking activation and there was a narrative going around that funds could be stolen from SegWit addresses. So regardless of flawless testnet testing it was being blocked. Charlie lee approached bitcoin core devs and suggested getting it activated on Litecoin which happened then he set up SegWit address with the equivalent of $1 Million USD worth of litecoin in it for anyone to hack.

"Youre confusing logic with risk. 

A risky investment is not illogical so long as the investor has good reason to believe his money will grow. 

The problem here is you guys are taking a sum of money which to you is life changing, and applying it to an example (beanie babies) that you don’t believe will grow in value. But if $1 million was peanuts to you, and if deep down you had good reason to suspect beanie babies would double your money in a year - then there would be logic in the investment

The risk would be worth taking and is therefore logical. 

Illogical would be investing in something that you DIDNT think would make you money. That’s illogical. And if one thinks Bitcoin won’t ever make them money then they shouldn’t buy any. Not $5000 not $50 not $5. 

But if you truly believe it will increase in value then a $500,000 investment is just as logical as a $50 one - (more so actually) - provided that the loss of that money would have no impact on your life.

"Once you deposit funds into a bank, it’s no longer “your” money.  It’s now an asset of the bank, with an offsetting non secured liability on the bank balance sheet.  in essence, when you deposit YOUR money into a bank, it becomes the banks money and they are in ultimate control of that money, as is indicated in this situation!  They have a contract with you, that gives you unsecured claims to the money...  but of course, you can’t actually take them to court and sue them, you need to take them to arbitration, and use the banks chosen arbiter, who is paid by the bank, and who cannot survive without the relationship with the bank...   in other words, good luck, your going to need a hell of a lot more than that though!

The solution, get your money out of the banks!  Hold cash, crypto, or physical bullion, and you’ll be in control of your own finances.

And for me, it's not a race who picks the ""Golden coin"" with 100x gains. It's about being interested in a new technology that could change the world. And veterans or Noobs, as crypto-enthusiasts we are all in it together. If one token gets accepted and gains bigtime, we all benefit and we are one step closer to the acceptance of crypto.

The military budget is the portion of the discretionary United States federal budget allocated to the Department of Defense, or more broadly, the portion of the budget that goes to any military-related expenditures. The military budget pays the salaries, training, and health care of uniformed and civilian personnel, maintains arms, equipment and facilities, funds operations, and develops and buys new items. The budget funds four branches of the U.S. military: the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force. In FY 2015, Pentagon and related spending totaled $598 billion, about 54% of the fiscal year 2015 U.S. discretionary budget.

In 2015, Forbes named Holmes as the youngest self-made female billionaire in the world due to a $9 billion valuation of Theranos. The next year Forbes revised her net value to zero dollars, given an updated $800 million valuation of Theranos and the fact that many of Theranos' investors hold preferred shares and so would be paid before Holmes (who holds common stock) in a liquidation event.

In 2016, after a series of journalistic and regulatory investigations that questioned the veracity of Holmes' claims, federal prosecutors began criminal investigations for potentially misleading investors and the government about Theranos' blood-testing technology.

Also is an exchange have a built in wallet that means can keep my coins there? I know it's not very secure. Any ressources on how to find potential good crypto to day trade? Thanks,1523003725
"As in similar situation as yours this is what I plan to do.
I'll keep holding the ETH/BTC I've there never selling in such a loss. Transfer it to a paper wallet.
Sell them on a internet forum when market is bullish again  for PAYPAL/SKRILL/NETELLER  at international market rate, people only charge 10% commission.
Then you can get the fiat transfer to your bank from paypal /skrill or neteller.",1523003630
"Not necessarily. Hedging is about taking an opposing position to reduce risk, so since bitcoin is a separate asset class, it depends on the correlation factor of bitcoin to the rest of a portfolio. Which ever position, long or short, is the least correlated is the one which is better for hedging.",1523003530
"I don't think anybody believes Bitcoin is worth nothing.  I think new dumb money will come in when it's cheap enough, with some major fiat pairings for alts.  I think the market will pump because people are greedy, and this is a great way to make money.  I think crypto is worth at least a trillion as a market, because I think the blockchain is a technology that will outgrow gold and silver.  I think smart money is waiting on the sidelines, waiting to strike  I thin that bitcoin has gone through bull crazes for its entire life, and it will happen again.  I think there's so much potential for hype and greed and energy in a new asset class.  Gold isn't worth 8 trillion, but we say it is.  Who's to say we won't one day say the same about bitcoin?  I think real world application is coming, the price just outraced the tech for a little while.  If you don't see the potential that blockchain has on the global economy, you're just playing with a volatile asset.  And that's fine, but it's not why I'm here.  I invested for financial independence, this is my lottery ticket.  But I also invested because I hate the incredibly wealthy elite that keep millions of my people in rags.  I see a future for blockchain and crypto, and I see it as the great equalizer.  Is that all bullshit hope?  Probably, but it's my hope, and my truth.",1523003444
"&gt; Something I've learned about life in the decade or so since graduating university is that people value social relationships more then they value doing the right thing. 

This strongly depends on culture in a particular country. Some countries, like Italy or China, for example, put a lot more emphasis on personal relationships and it's frustrating, because it matters who you know, not what you offer. In other countries people are more open to the concept of ""I don't like him, but he has a point"". Some cultures are just more enlightened. Since most of the Bitcoin miners are in China, well, there you have it :)",1523003418
"He is not 100% wrong. That's why I like Nano, to me is the only crypto currency with chances of a fair fight in terms of convenience.

But in any case, all cryptos make far more sense in the developing world, the truth is that centralized systems are still far better overall for most people in the developed world.",1523003398
"Just send them to Another Exchange, sell, buy 4 bucks worth of bitcoin.",1523003396
"The thing is, a lot of the stuff being claimed to have been done by the Core devs or Blockstream or Bitcoin supporters has actually been done by BCH supporters. I don't have the time to re-hash this all out at the moment, but I do have an opinion on one other thing mentioned: ""In our story, Core claims Segwit has fixed the block size debate when it is really the transaction volume that has dropped.""

Except, we already have had larger than 1MB blocks for the four months prior to the recent drop off in activity (which has happened across the board, no just with Bitcoin), and those four months happened even without certain major transactional entities such as Coinbase having implemented SegWit addresses or doing batching yet. This means that the next time we have a spike in transactions, there most definitely will be more capacity available. Furthermore, this isn't something that by itself ""fixed the block size debate"", that's a strawman, as no one reasonable claims that further optimizations aren't needed.

"For the vast majority of human history, we did not live in totalitarian governments.

Humanity managed to rid itself of slavery countless times. The fall of Rome, liberated the masses and got rid of slavery. The Dark ages, lol, was a free time, grab the land and till it.

Serfdom again, a form of slavery, evolved later in higher middle ages, and yet again humanity managed to rid itself and free, liberty and equality was desired with American and French revolutions.

An endless cycle, it has been repeated from the beginning of civilization becausae writing invented a form of debt which was hard to cancel. Revolutions are cancellations of debt and restoration of freedom.

Why do we succumb to slavery? I dunno. Maybe it happens slowly, like boiling frogs we dont notice it.

But there is always a breaking point, freedom is taken back quickly.

The natural state of humanity is free, freedom.

Bitcoin wont free us, we dont even need bitcorn, I would say, keeping still thinking that we need a ""muh free market"" ""muh unchangeable non-inflationary currency"", is quite retarded - same retardation as the miner who cant imagine thinking without authority.

The free market concept, the usage of ""a currency"" to manage social relationships, is the retardation.

Think, brutally.

"This is the 3rd BNB burn; one in october, one in december and one this month. 

Each burn has had a big price bump *after* the burn. The December burn sent the price from $10 -&gt; $24 which is what people believe to be the actual value of the coin if it weren't being dragged around by BTC. 

Binance basically use some of their profits to buy back a certain amount of BNB and remove them from the network, reducing the supply which increases the value. The more profit Binance make, the more coins are burned and the more value BNB holders see. ",1523003286

"God, every time I say I don’t want to reply to comments I get people like you. Do you understand the nuances it takes for a beginner who bought the week before the crash to be at a net profit at the moment?? I put $100 in late December. I put most of my money into crypto on January 2nd. 6 days before the crash. I didn’t have two months of “gains”. I was rekt after a week instantly. I didn’t have the opportunity to get in on the most insane run in history. Well the market has been dumping in February and March. It wasn’t a “couple trades”, and it wasn’t lucky. No one gets lucky and can do a 8x over 20 trades in this shit market. I don’t look at twitter for calls. I make my own calls, because that’s how you get the best entry points. You think people called $Trac at 15k gweis? For example, I called HPB at 22k sats two days ago it pumped to 37k, and this is just a recent example. Besides stop judging the advice based on the person giving it. Judge it on its own merits. Hate how people like you keep putting me in a position where I have to come off as a douche and talk about my “accomplishments”, because you keep downplaying the difficulty in making money in this market, and you don’t even mention the talking points I give you just attack me.

"&gt;&amp;gt;True on the BTC fork. And that mainly why it is a departure for the original design.

&gt;Which version of the reference client do you regard as ""the original""?

&gt;V0.1 created by Satoshi?

&gt;V0.3.19 when Satoshi himself was still chief and main developer?

&gt;V0.14.0 the version modified to create BCH?

No particular version is the « original »

Using limited capacity as a permanent economic characteristics was the departure from the original vision and had an impact on Bitcoin growth since about two years.

It took an HF for Bitcoin to recover its characteristics.

BTC is now doing something different.. nobody really know.. some kind of store of value (that dropped 75% in three month) digital gold (ponzi)...


&gt;&amp;gt;A node can’t detect a soft fork by design

&gt;Of course they can be *detected*. 

How?

&gt;They are designed to not violate older, earlier, ""original"" rules - thus blocks with the new rules are ""valid"". This makes them backwards compatible because they do not break consensus. 

So such block (with one tx max) would not break consensus.

If your Node decide to reject that chain, you are breaking consensus. Your are not Bitcoin anymore (by your definition).

&gt;If the soft fork you described were implemented it is then up to the soft forking nodes to try and reach a clear majority and reach a certain percent of the network hash rate usually by a certain block number. 

&gt;Otherwise, the soft fork will fail and the original chain will simply carry on unchanged.   

and what if the miner got majority and the soft fork activated?

Now this chain is bitcoin using your argument *(SF maintain consensus therefore whatever SF you apply will always be bitcoin)*.

The problem any parameters can be changed via SF.
Just use the segwit trick, hide data to old nodes and go on.

Meaning that bitcoin can transform into everything and yet remain bitcoin somehow, with no respect to the original experiment, convinient.

&gt;&amp;gt;If you ignore the longest chain you are HF away and breaking consensus too.

&gt;If you ignore the longest **valid** chain you are breaking consensus. BCH has a longer chain/more blocks because it *changed* it's difficulty adjustment algorithm *from the original*. Such a change rendered its blocks invalid on the original chain.  

BCH/BTC are incompatible chain, who has the longest chain dont matter.

&gt;&amp;gt;Big blocks are the original design. 

&gt;Big block were, and are, an attack vector. Satoshi fixed that error himself and many other flaws have also been fixed since V0.1

Funny that he reply with a post including the code to remove like a non-event (and made numerous post on bitcoin scaling with massive blocks)

&gt;&amp;gt;Stealing the name and network effect.

&gt;Only BCH bag holders believe that because that's what they were told by the people scamming them.

Not really, Bitcoin has been victims of a social attack, it is now stripped of his name and network effect and has restart from scratch.. but I am glad the experiment can continue.",1523003009

Newcomers that are foolish enough to entirely disregard BCH because this CSW guy with questionable character is making truth statements, are the exact newcomers that are going to be continually manipulated through fallacious arguments like character attacks *instead* of basing arguments on their own merrit.

Saying we should focus on arguments when these 'people' are not even looking at the arguments is silly.

"Suppose that CSW is indeed not Satoshi (which is really quite probable, as he hasn't given any proof of the contrary, worse, has given a false proof). I do find it astonishing that he is given so much voice KNOWING this. Inviting a random bch supporter on stage would actually a priori be better: at least the random bch supporter isn't a blatant liar (and this is a HUGE lie). If the guy was a technical genius, I might understand that he's still given a stage for his technical expertise. But clearly, the other technical experts (VB, the guy that created the LN whitepaper, etc) agree that he isn't at the right technical level. So I entirely understand their position: promoting a fraud who gives false technical details is probably not the best thing. There is probably someone that really has something to bring to the table that could be invited instead. 
In the btc/bch debate, I'm totally for bch (like vitalik seems to be). I support people like Roger Ver for example: he is honest. But CSW... not so much. 
Also, saw CSW presenting. As a researcher in mathematics (having also studied computer science) who actually goes to quite a few technical conferences, his way of presenting really doesn't strike me like the 'technical' person Satoshi probably is. He sounds a lot more like a commercial type. Of course, this judgment is very subjective and prone to error. ",1523001234

It had a bubble. Boo-hoo, who cares?

I can't speak for everyone else, but I didn't jump ship out of FOMO. I jumped ship because bitcoins 1mb blocksize limit made transactions unreliable and costly and caused a negative merchant adoption rate.

Even if someone came along and minted a handful of rhodium coins, they'd technically be worth more due to scarcity, but probably much harder to move.

"Another important aspect of investing in crypto is to no longer play by ""traditional"" rules.if i want to make 5-10% a year then I would consider it..it almost seems like some people are just so stuck in the old ways of doing things,that they cannot help themselves...these options are the antithesis of decentralized with no platform and even if they do offer a cryptocurrency ,that will be also centralized.",1522998960

Mayweather must really stay up to date on Crypto. I heard he spent a lot of time reading into it.,1522998812
Or if that is not possible this way.. Then I guess I need to make a formule to have it shown in btc? Hehe any idea what that formule would be? :D,1522998734

All bits of adoption add up. This is making people aware of NANO and crypto in general. May lead to people looking into this space and every little bit counts. We are the marketers for crypto at the moment. Instead of critiquing it you should be doing your part to help the crypto community. The OP should be applauded for helping the cause instead of trolling on an internet blog. ,1522998525

"I think you underestimate how stupid people can be, those hodlers didn't buy bitcoin they bought a dream of one day being rich. For them nothing can make them think it won't happen. It's delusion, a cult. It's like ponzi cultist. ",1522998467

"My only issue with referring to the 2014 crash is the fact it wasn't ""Mainstream"" at the time. This isn't just a crash of price but a crash global trust for it. I'll still HODL and buy more because I have faith in Crypto. But to say we're fine because we've been threw this before is inaccurate",1522998414
But NANO has a product and isn't a scam. Big difference. Crypto isn't a sports competition. Adoption helps everyone in crypto and these things add up and aid in that.,1522998393

"&gt; Bitcoins DAA follows Satoshis original vision, btw.

Actually, Bitcoin Cash follows Satoshi's vision a bit closer:

&gt;To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time, **the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of blocks per hour.** If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases.

http://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin/#selection-129.4-129.264

The original Bitcoin DAA is a 2016 block cumulative average, (probably better defined as ""Epoch block average"") which adjusts based on how far it deviates from 20,160 minutes, it is not a **moving** average.

Whats the tax for gifting in Poland? Maybe you could gift the crypto to someone in another country then he pays his taxes and gifts the fiat to you with is taxed again in most countries. Maybe check the math on that. Dont know if this is even legal. Just a thought. DYOR ofc. ,1522998197
