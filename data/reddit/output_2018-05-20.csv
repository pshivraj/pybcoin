This is basically a back of envelope calculation that proves Nano is more efficient that not only the traditional banking system, but a single traditional bank organisation. There's no need to add vaults and warehouses to prove my point.

Do you have anything to back up your claim? I would be interested to see it.

"Well probably with bitcoin it's the usual greed etc, he might be trying to liquidate a large position and once he'd transferred bitcoin and taken dollars and they start saying where the money came from \(after you give them bitcoin\) now you're screwed because you can't get the bitcoin back, and probably the Feds would expect you to give them the dirty money like it's the proceeds of crime and therefore not yours to keep \(makes sense in the abstract, but in bitcoin land there's no take\-backs so you're out the bitcoin\).

So probably what Ong should have done is \- IF \- he sold them bitcoin, they received bitcoin, he got cash, then they said 'hurr durr it was from drugs' \- THEN he should have backed off, \- sounds like he's Canadian \- so then he should have thoroughly snarled shit up for the cops on the USA side by contacting the RCMP and maybe the DEA and maybe Vancouver WA police and maybe anyone that would let him wear a wire and/or totally get all up in it.

"I agree lets be honest.

Companies have different priorities than users. They dislike premature optimization, the do like reaching as many people as possible, and they do like lower costs of operating.

Blocksize limits and fee markets, however necessary for the maturation of this limited global resource we call the bitcoin blockchain, creates engineering friction and worse - unpredictable cost increases and a disrupted user experience. It's bad for business. We saw hundreds of blockchain companies migrate chains or shut down when fees exploded. There is a strong incentive for these companies to assert influence to suite their needs.

Through this lens it seems obvious why a business like BitPay would support s2x, why nearly all Bitcoin companies came together and unilaterally attempt to change the rules of consensus.

Just in principle, the idea that companies would attempt to unilaterally make a consensus change is offensive to users who value decentralization. So we fought. Users won. No s2x.

This leaves a bitter taste in an executives mouth. Time to hedge our bets. If this blockchain won't provide the free infrastructure we want lets encourage another blockchain which might. So BCH gets integrated, and they expand the blocksize, and the world doesn't come tumbling down. To any executive this sounds like validation. Why bother even optimizing the BTC chain transactions now? You have the network backbone you want to work with, pouring development resources into a network you know won't ever be as cheap is a total waste of time and money. Allow the negative user experience to push transactions towards your preferred and cheaper solution and be done with it.",1526882976

"Crook is someone that deliberately lies to people, and he is doing it also.

While he is knowledgeable, I have to give him that, he still uses propaganda against Bitcoin Cash, he used to say that Bitcoin can scale, on-chain, but changed his time (as many others) once Blockstream got their dirty hands involved.

Calling Bitcoin Cash as Bcash, which he did also, shows that he is not objective, and he also promotes the Lightning network, saying same crap as everyone else, how its only way to scale Bitcoin, and other crap which is simply not true.

Him and every other crook that says that LN is scaling of Bitcoin, is as bullshit as saying that you can talk English by using German.

And in fact, what LN does with BTC is equivalent to using English works, but in German language rules and structure. Both English and German are languages, but they are different languages, have different structure, etc.

LN and Bitcoin are both monetary systems (systems to transfer money, in this case crypto currency) but they work differently.

Also, Bitcoin is both a currency and a monetary system, while LN is only a monetary syste, and not a currency.

The goal of bankers is to have Blockstream (and people like Andreas, if that is his real name) is to prevent people from using decentralised monetary system like Bitcoin (and they don't worry about other crap as they know they have no real use case that threatens their monopoly) and to trick everyone into thinking that Bitcoin can't scale and that we need different monetary system, in which you can use the funds that Bitcoin system creates through mining, but their system is not decentralised like Bitcoin is.

Don't worry, nobody will think that of you. Search /r/btc, there are dozens of posts of people like you that were anti-BCH trolls, but than understood they were wrong. Those people are accepted here with open arms. We don't blame people for falling to well-coordinated propoganda.

Accept the truth. You know you ran out of arguments some time ago. Don't worry. Nobody will blame you. And if you are afraid of your friends in the Bitcoin(BTC) - think about it this way - are they really your friends if they force you to live in a lie?",1526878423

"It depends on ""how true"" so to speak.  Let's say BTC is currently worth $100.  If I think it's going to go up in price, I would buy some BTC and hold on to it for a while.  If BTC goes up in price, say to $110, I could sell the BTC for more than I paid for it and realize a profit.  On Wall Street, this is called a long position.

Shorting something is the opposite.  If I thought that BTC was overpriced at $100, and expected it to go down, I could short it.  When you short something, the exchange borrows it from someone else and then you sell the borrowed BTC.  If the price dips from $100 to $90, you can buy the borrowed BTC back from the market for less than what you sold it for, again realizing a profit.

Now, if you short something and the price goes up, because you borrowed it for someone else the exchange can call your tab (liquidate you) and force you to buy back at a higher price so they can give the borrowed BTC back to it's rightful owner.",1526877830

The word ""consensus"" gets thrown around wayyyy too much without being given a strict definition. The fact that there hasn't been a mass movement of people to BCH from BTC doesn't show a lack of consensus, not technically. It could equally be explained by self interested parties (myself one of them) wanting to maximise their asset value. If you want a representation of where some part of consensus was, and where the rest of the people are who are/were more of less hedging their bets, you'd see who sold off their BCH coins when the fork occurred (at a large loss), but even then, this is a poor metric (and an impractical one).

"I'll just say a little more in terms of the reasons(zero fees, fast transactions) /u/Qwahzi has mentioned. 

Zero transaction fees allow anyone in the world with just a simple computing device(say a low tier android phone), and a connection to the internet to be able to participate in a global economy. That 1 cent that you think is useless to you, could be very beneficial to some of the poorest participants in the global economy. And to make things better, the zero transaction fee doesn't matter on the value of the transaction. Now instead of people just being able to participate in an internet of data, you also have people being able to participate in an internet of value. At least that's how I see it, it's brilliant imo. 

And to top off this zero transaction fee, the transaction is extremely fast and I'm sure you can think of countless reasons why the speed of a transaction is extremely important. I'll give one, you're ordering a BigMac on McDonalds self-serve machines, you decide to use bitcoin(lul), and now you have to wait over an hour just for it to confirm.

"Very Quick Primer on this subject (Disclaimer: Moderator over at The Quantum Resistant Ledger - QRL)

- Lots of encryption has [assumptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_hardness_assumption).
- Computers struggle some problems. For example, they can multiply two numbers together *fast* but it's *very* difficult to factor a large integer. There are even [integer factorization records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization_records)  
- *Quantum* Computers can't do everything, they're good at a certain number of things, but not at others. 
- The Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP) is something that the internet uses (ie. HTTPS) and almost all cryptocurrencies utilize. Through the use of Shor's algorithm and a sufficiently powerful *error corrected* Quantum Computer, it can be done. [Quantum Resource Estimates for Computing Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithms](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/598.pdf) goes into the estimated resources.  
- [Quantum attacks on Bitcoin, and how to protect against them](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10377) models the progression of QC's and estimates 2027 as being a date Bitcoin could be attacked.  It also highlights key methods of how it would be done.  
- [IBM](https://www.research.ibm.com/ibm-q/), [Google](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610274/google-thinks-its-close-to-quantum-supremacy-heres-what-that-really-means/), [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/quantum/), and [Alibabi](https://medium.com/syncedreview/alibaba-launches-11-qubit-quantum-computing-cloud-service-ad7f8e02cc8) are just some of the companies fighting for Quantum Supremacy or otherwise in big on Quantum Computing in the last 2 years. With the amount of Industry that's gotten into this (vs Academic), it's a hint that we're on the cusp of something.  
- NIST is [gathering submissions for PQ Cryptography](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Post-Quantum-Cryptography/Round-1-Submissions), and the [NSA, 2016 updates it's suite B recommendations](https://www.fredericjacobs.com/blog/2016/01/27/NSA-QC/). Notably for bitcoin, [which uses secp256k1](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1) and to something with a P-384 at a minimum. 
- For the internet, [google was testing PQ Crypto in your browser in 2016](https://www.pindrop.com/blog/google-is-now-testing-post-quantum-crypto-in-chrome/), there's [a test site for [Post Quantum PKI](http://test-pqpki.com/), and [other projects like Open Quantum Safe](https://openquantumsafe.org/)

"You're only considering one dimension of decentralisation \- mining. The other dimensions, like node distribution and development are just as, if not more important.

We saw in 2017 with Bitcoin Cash and segwit2x that no one group controls Bitcoin, especially not the miners.

Furthermore, controlling a high amount of the hash rate actually allows you to do very little \- and if you do something that hurts the network, you've just destroyed your own investment in mining equipment. This is why people say that Bitcoin has a perfect incentive structure \- everyone benefits more from being honest than dishonest.

Now look at IOTA \- there can be no claim at decentralisation when, if a single entity is shut down \(the coordinator\), the entire network ceases to function. If the node you're connected to goes down, as we saw last week, you can't send a transaction.

As for Nano \- development is centralised on Colin Lemahieu. At some point he needs to step down and let the project develop without him, because if he becomes God\-king like Vitalik has, then he becomes a centralised point of failure either through bad decision\-making \(no one is perfect\) or through coercion. Try to go after the Bitcoin devs, there are hundreds of them all over the world and no one gets the final say on anything.

The other problem with Nano is that running a node is very resource intensive and last I checked required IPv6 \- I'm not interested in a cryptocurrency if it's impossible for the average user to contribute to the peer\-to\-peer network.",1526874268

1. Someone posted a link to the Bitcoin stack exchange earlier with someone asking about creating a 24 word seed. This post was made at the end of this past January, and I'm pretty sure its the creator of this art for a few reasons. Also, if he used a 12-word seed it would be a matter of days to brute force the seed if you were able to collect the correct words (or even most of them). If you were doing a several thousand dollar giveaway, would you want it to be easy?


2. This goes back to the Bitcoinstackexchange post. If the creator was asking about how to make a specific mneumonic seed based on the English BIP39 words of his choosing, then he definitely selected the words beforehand. It is possible he did not, but extremely unlikely. Why go to the extra effort you randomized everything? Remember, the puzzle's creator said we would be certain when we figured it out. It will be a phrase that makes sense. I don't think you'd even need to brute force the seed if we only had 12 words. Once you found the correct set a sentence generator online could probably put it together.

Then there needs to be a mechanism like voting to determine what loans should be approved or denied (applicants maybe need to present a strategy and have some kind of reputation), and then the funds need to be distributed automatically and finally a contract in place holds to receiver accountable, smart contracts can be used deal with those logistics.

"I don't know of a single transaction that has ever been reversed in a POW blockchain beyond hacks, of which Ethereum has had many so don't talk to me about how POS is somehow more secure.  I mean I know Verge had mining issues, Dash had some in its initial days, but I know of no blocks being reversed, just poor software implementations, just like how the biggest crypto going to POS, Ethereum, has experienced several hacks for which they sacrificed the immutability of their blockchain instead to rely on social consensus to determine the true chain.  The problem with the nothing at stake problem is that if someone uses this attack there is no incentive structure to stop them.  I know the common reply is that punishments are enacted for misbehaving nodes, but the Lightning Network is trying that right now as we speak and customers funds are being inadvertently stolen due to the system thinking that a user error is evidence of them being a malicious attacker.  

The reason POW is secure is because even if one pool has 99% of the hashpower they lose out immensely in the short term for breaking consensus.  In POS it is easier to break short-term consensus because the only way to ensure consensus is through punitive actions.  POW says do it right or don't get paid, POS says do it right or get punished, but if punishment goes wrong on the software level the only way to enforce it is with social consensus.

After all, you don't care about it being a digital gold, you just want to spend it quickly right? Perfect, USDC Coin will hold its value and be very reliable with probably no transfer fees. Night night bcash. Hell, even bitmain invested into Circle. Looks like they might be abandoning bcash.

"No, you buy dollars for your services which actually have real world value and a use case, and you sell dollars to your government to be applicable for other real world services and goods such as roads, health care, etc...

You also sell dollars for food and stuff which have a real world use case. The actual dollar itself is useless to you, and have zero use case unless there is another person willing to accept it for their goods or services.  Whatever you trade for index funds are still around to depreciate, because like it or not that investment will still only be returned to you in dollars. You cannot trade your index fund for food, clothes, or a house without first selling it for some form of currency.

At which point you still need to find someone willing to accept said currency for the goods or services they offer, and make sure you're not outbid by someone else holding the same currency to actually recieve anything of real value and use.

Reading your other comments though I get the sensation you've come here to troll, and you're not really all that interested in neither blockchain nor cryptocurrencies - as you seem to confuse Bitcoin for cryptocurrencies quite a lot, and you also seem to repeat yourself with the same few 'arguments' you thought would be clever, though to be fair they only let it shine through that you've misunderstood this entire technology and the actual implications and use cases of cryptocurrencies which goes far beyond that of fiat currencies - so I wont waste my breath.",1526865347

This kind of step is very positive for the future and for those who support Bitcoin Cash,1526864448
"Once again, I think there is a reason why people wanted the gold iou more than the gold itself -- but only for large amounts. (For small amounts they used gold coins.) Gold was heavy, and so if you had a large amount, it was easier to transact in ious than in the actual gold. The ious were useful in a way that large amounts of gold we're inconvenient. But with bitcoin, it's different. Bitcoins don't weigh anything. In fact, I think the higher the on-paper value of the iou, the more you'd want the actual coins. If a bank offered you an iou for 1000 satoshis, you might consider leaving it in my custody, but only if it was somehow easier for them to manage your transactions than you. But if a bank offered you an iou for 5 whole bitcoins, I'll bet you'd want to turn it in immediately and get the coins. With bitcoin, higher amounts are not harder to manage or heavier to carry, so leaving it in a bank's custody only has downsides. That's another reason why I think fractional reserve wouldn't work with bitcoin. Unlike with gold, people would rather turn in the iou immediately than let the bank keep the custody. And if any bank refused to give anything but ious, it's customers would stop putting their money there.",1526864400

"First of all, that wasn't my claim it was OPs. Second, he wasn't saying Bitcoin was perfect, just that the fact that average Libertarians were the first adopters makes it egalitarian. I'm not sure I exactly agree with OP on that. I guess I would say, it's good that Libertarians were the early adopters and that Bitcoin is more egalitarian than any form of money we've seen thus far.

Regarding the Winklevoss, it really depends how well they protect their private keys mostly. Even if they manage their keys properly, their heirs may not be as wise as they are and will undoubtably have less Bitcoin progressively each generation because they won't be able to create money like central bankers can.

I think you have fallen for the false narrative that Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and Warren Buffet are the richest people in the world. I know most people think and they probably have the highest net worth the way the Forbes calculates it, but there are definitely richer families that control much more money than these three. It's just that those families keep their money in trusts which don't show up on someone's net worth. They also pool their assets. Again, the Federal Reserve loaned around $600 billion into existence this year. Someone (or a group of people) owns the Federal Reserve, it's not the government. What are those people's net worths? I mean, when you start to think about it's kinda silly to believe that the three richest men in the world are all self made. Of course the families that control the banking and political systems are more wealthy. So, the Winklevoss would be very rich if Bitcoin were as valuable as you mentioned, but they would not have the perpetual advantage that central bankers have today. And that is the key difference and why Bitcoin is more egalitarian than fiat.",1526861633

"I don’t believe the bitcoin blockchain will trend toward a 51% attack for the simple reason that the miners have an economic incentive NOT to allow their hashpower to assume majority control. The system relies on rational self interest, and it is no miner’s interest to undermine trust in their bread and butter.

It may be that DAGs will be really cool, but you are comparing the pie-in-the-sky future of DAGs versus the reality of blockchain today. The fact is, iota has a centralized validator because there isn’t enough traffic for the tangle to operate on its own. And nano relies on altruistic, unpaid validators to check for inconsistencies in the transactions. I don’t know if there’s a single example of a DAG working the way the theory says they should.

We are pretty sure proof of work blockchains are basically bulletproof at this point, but we don’t have remotely close to the same confidence in DAGs. Maybe someday?",1526858834

"&gt;Bitcoin split

There was a hard fork last year in August, which initiated Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin, on the other hand, activated a soft fork, like [many before](https://blog.bitmex.com/bitcoins-consensus-forks/). Soft forks do not break the consensus rules, by definition. Which is why the network continued to work flawlessly. So the original chain is still up and running, and going strong. Bitcoin.

&gt;There're two economically relevant Bitcoins

There is only one Bitcoin, and there are other projects which have similarities - It all started with the whitepaper. But there's only one chain where the consensus rules are compatible from today all the way to ~2011, certainly 2012. That's Bitcoin. You cannot ignore consensus rules because this is what it's all about, consensus and enforcing those rules. So not only does Bitcoin Cash not adhere to the legacy consensus rules, but it also doesn't have social consensus (it's a minority chain, be honest). 

There's only one Bitcoin.",1526858360

"So in this scenario that has ""a greater than 50% chance of coming true"" according to the author, why is there no mention of:

* The effect of the supposed success of LN on Bitcoin's price and the positive outcome it implies for miners' rewards valuation implicitly. Miners also have an interest in seeing the network function as efficiently as possible, it gives value to their rewards (and holdings for the ones who do keep them past their lock time).

* The fact that miners can see an opportunity in running their own Lightning Network nodes and still collect fees this way. They have full nodes at disposal and the requirements to run LN nodes are not really that costly.

* The fact that there will still be a need for many transactions on the first layer even if LN is adopted by a lot of users because:    
   1. Opening and closing LN channels require on-chain transactions.
   2. LN is, as described on its whitepaper is ""a network of **micropayment** channels"" (emphasis is mine), and transactions of large amounts of Bitcoin are not really the use case envisioned by the authors or the actual developers. While possible such transactions would have a harder time finding routes with sufficient liquidity unless everyone starts opening channels with large amounts, and unless this happen such transactions would be much easier on-chain.

It can be a fun thought experiment to make predictions like these, but honestly if the author is going to only look at the negative impact an event can have and discard anything positive it can bring you cannot really end up with a balanced and probable outcome... you just get a worst case scenario that is possibility but the most unlikely (aka not ""a greater than 50% chance of coming true"").",1526857956

Also almost all of these coins only have a fraction of the transactions that bitcoin has and haven't been battle tested or stressed tested in the same way or length of time.

Lightning is looking very promising and will hopefully fix the speed and fees issues to make it more like cash. Transactions are instant and almost free.

"&gt;You'd only have lost 50% if you put your life savings in at the top of the market

Based on trade volumes, [a double digit percentage of all the money that has ever entered the market got in around this time](https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/volume/all?c=e&amp;t=b) 

The last 3 significant rises in bitcoins price have followed the same pattern. A flurry in speculative interest and price skyrockets, followed by a crash and then a long period of stagnation, followed by another larger flurry of speculation. None of these spikes have actually been correlated to a spike in utility or acceptance, just interest from speculators. At the time of the last spike bitcoin was being abandoned by large merchants like Steam and the fees and confirmation times were in the toilet.

 Every time bitcoin speculators have previously lost and price has become stagnant they've been saved by an even bigger wave of speculators. But that requires an exponentially greater amount each time. Given that Bitcoin was getting more searches than Trump and Pizza, and was getting mentioned on TV news, newspapers, magazines and pop culture, its unlikely there are any great numbers of speculators left. The time for speculators getting rich on other speculators has passed. Any asset can keep going up in value so long as you keep getting people to put money into it, thats at the core of every pump and dump, its not sustainable.

""hedge against inflation"" ignores where price increases have come from. It's not slow steady increase in adoption or improvements in utility.

All it can do now is actually become a superior alternative to existing currencies, which it is steadfastly refusing to do so. It's accepted in fewer places you can measure than it was 4 years ago. Trade volume and transactions are at a 2 year low.

From the PDF (page 9) :  
&gt;Scott describes blockchain as: “interesting because it has features that potentially allow for non-hierarchal self-organization and peer-to-peer collaboration within a communitarian network structure” [8]. The suggestion is that Nakamoto’s design of BTC, which is based on a community of validators providing co-operative consensus [12], has qualities suited to Socialist ideology. Speciﬁcally, Scott asks whether blockchain systems can be used to provide governance for large-scale collaboration under Anarchist traditions, who rely on social and interdependent natures of the individual to create smaller-scale, egalitarian structures [8]. Indeed, some authors are exploring the Socialist ideology behind the technology and the idea of blockchains which enable collaboration through distributed autonomy. For example, Swan writes that blockchain has democratisation capabilities that include the concept of decentralised organisations [4]. Wright et al. write that the blockchain: “enables collective organisations and social institutions to become more ﬂuid and promote greater participation, potentially transforming how corporate governance and democratic institutions operate",1526856193

"Lightning network can't scale to global usage, can't operate onchain and will result in massive centralised nodes if it is somehow successful. 

For example, every single person in the world who wants to complete a Lightning transaction would go through one of maybe 10 nodes worldwide who are connected together. These ~10 nodes then have complete control over whether or not your transaction goes through. Sound familiar? It should, it's exactly how banks operate today.

The BTC development 'team' are all on Blockstream's payroll, thus the development of BTC is completely controlled by Blockstream. That is how it is justified. This is why BCH forked before the segwit fork so as to maintain a pure Bitcoin chain in the form of Bitcoin (BCH). 

You and a lot of other people don't know a lot about this because it is actively censored in all the major cryptocurrency sites such as /r/bitcoin, bitcoin.org and bitcointalk. Additionally /r/cryptocurrency actively downvotes all Bitcoin (BCH) threads no matter what they are, I was very surprised to see this thread on the front page tbh. I even posted a thread a few days ago letting /r/cryptocurrency know that Bitcoin (BCH) had successfully forked/upgraded again to include smart contracts, 32mb blocks and colored coins however it got zero upvotes because of all the BTC maximalists who fear BCH (they sold their BCH for next to nothing last August after the BCH fork), a concerted propaganda campaign painting BCH as a scam and paid shillers to control the BTC/BCH narrative. 

Doesn't matter though, even with all this bullshit going on Bitcoin (BCH) is still growing.

"**Libertarian socialism**

Libertarian socialism (or socialist libertarianism) is a group of anti-authoritarian political philosophies inside the socialist movement that rejects socialism as centralized state ownership and control of the economy.

Libertarian socialism also rejects the state itself, is close to and overlaps with left-libertarianism and criticizes wage labour relationships within the workplace, instead emphasizing workers' self-management of the workplace and decentralized structures of political organization. It asserts that a society based on freedom and justice can be achieved through abolishing authoritarian institutions that control certain means of production and subordinate the majority to an owning class or political and economic elite. Libertarian socialists advocate for decentralized structures based on direct democracy and federal or confederal associations such as libertarian municipalism, citizens' assemblies, trade unions and workers' councils.

Wow. I guess it's silly of me to expect you to actually look at the evidence we have of the over 90% consensus. Let's just throw around claims instead with no regard for reality.

&gt;I don't get how the majority somehow has no say... but whatever. Who knows what happens in the future. I'm sticking to facts.

The majority in this case is the miners because they are the ones that decide which chain is longer. As we've already established, over 90% of them wanted bigger blocks. It doesn't take a genius to deduce that they didn't pick the BTC chain because they agree with the smaller blocks, but because that is where the money is. So saying that we reached consensus because of a longer chain is absolutely ridiculous.

Looking further ahead, 2019 will probably be on the applicability of LN and Bitcoin's role as a payment platform rather than just a speculation investment platform. And of course there's a good chance we'll see another boom in 2019 so it will once again be about Bitcoin's price surge.",1526853571

I agree, the head start may not be a big deal. It's hard to tell how much that will matter, it all depends on how many dapps launch by that time and how popular they get. I estimate that it will take about 8 months before other blockchain platforms catch up to EOS.",1526851802

If you twist language and truth around then yes, if the only real coin is the coin that theymos says it is ... then you are doomed dude. Better sell your BTC because when Tether blows, BTC is done. It's utility is going down hard and that's the only thing that gives it any long term value.

Not al speculators and investors are as dumb as the average /r/cryptocurrency reader.

Big money is never going to go in to BTC if it's utility keeps going down.

BCH has like a 8 year headstart at the LN, that is being developed from the ground up.  Better get coding because by the time  LN offers any utilty whatsoever I would say it's very likely that 90% of the hashrate is with BCH.

The moment the price of BTC goes down enough, miners all over the world will rejoice and switch and never look back.

Then we will still be honest, unlike you guys, and not call BTC an altcoin. It's still Bitcoin and it always will be. But it's Bitcoin gone wrong. 

I find it very ironic that you have been working on a great website that was build around Satoshi's mechanism and you still don't understand that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value and any value that it has comes from it's benefits to society. Without utility it had zero benefits for society.

"&gt; You say I don't understand, but if you took two seconds to do some research you would know that nodes cannot even signal. Only miners can. 

Haha, gas-lighting once more? Quoting **your statement**, again: ""SegWit2X was signalled by over 90% of both miners and nodes.""

So get your own story straight. Can miners **and** nodes signal, or not. Then you can also check whether I ever claimed that non-mining nodes ""signaled"" (I didn't). And, you could do what you say I should do and read up. Like this (one of the first google results on Segwit signalling): https://segwit.org/user-activated-soft-forks-the-bip-148-alternative-28e87ffdb76f    
You can also watch [this talk by Andreas Antonopoulos which explains consensus by analogy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZDq-l9G3Jc). USAF starts at 16:25.   
All I said stands: Users (non-miners) can reject the blocks (BIP148). They would then go with a minority chain. If the economic majority accepts it, it would win consensus. 2x never even started because the economic consensus was already becoming clear, when more and more nodes switched to BIP148.

&gt; I meant you were the who mentioned profit in your last comment even after you said it was irrelevant. Diversion from what?

It's a diversion from the fork debate. Let's just end it then.

&gt; As I said in my original comment, BCH is Bitcoin. That would make it not an altcoin.

You can think whatever you like - you can even make up your own definition of words. But the public consensus is established on these. You (BCH supporters) lost (the debate/consensus). You (BCH supporters) have no (moral) right to steal the name.

"&gt;The technology works though

Works at what? It's handling less than 200k transactions a day, the last time it got anywhere close to handling 500k a day transactions were taking days to confirm and the average fees were over $20 a transaction. It will have to handle 150,000,000 transactions a day to replace something like Visa.

If you think the path to handling 150,000,000 per day is guaranteed (which is what it will have to handle to replace Visa), then you've deliberately blinded yourself to uncertainty for ideological reasons.

It's not even running close to capacity anymore, it could handle another 50% more transactions per day easily, which suggests that in its current form its already hit market saturation. And Lightning is still at 2,000 nodes if that's going to be brought up as the reason why people aren't transacting on chain any more.

&gt;Speculation on price is everywhere in life and fluctuates. A house in 2006 was not worth as much as a house in 2009. A house in 1970 is not worth as much as that same house in 2018.

Houses are always going to be worth something so long as the earth has gravity and people need shelter from the elements. There's a limited amount of space, a limited amount of building materials, and a growing number of people.

You can say ""but there's a limited amount of bitcoin too!"", but there's not a limited amount of currencies, or even a limited amount of currencies based on exactly the same technology as bitcoin. There are infinite perfect economic substitutes to bitcoin : the same free open source software its based on. So hoping to make money purely off scarcity rather than utility is a fools errand. If one person in the world managed to hoard all the bitcoin do you think that people couldn't just use a substitute?

 A currency is not always going to be worth something because they can always be replaced. What are houses going to be replaced with? Driverless RVs? Space cities? Any conceivable replacement to a house would not be great enough to render a house worthless.

So far, I only have gotten back a bit more than half that amount in total BTC. However, as I mentioned, if those BTCs were converted to their fiat(USD) value at the time they were sent to my wallet, I already got my USD225 back.

So, just looking at the fiat transactions, I already got RoI, and a tiny bit more. If BTC prices did not fall down, I should have gone way past RoI(again, in fiat/USD).

If you actually have read my whole comment, you would have read that I acknowledged that spending that USD225 to buy BTC and holding on to it is better than getting that contract, at least as of right now. Since it's a ""lifetime"" contract, however, I still have to see. I still get trickles of satoshis from it every now and then. If they don't prematurely terminate it, I'm expecting the contract to actually end when the BTC mining rewards half down.

"&gt; who had GitHub control.

Obviously write access to the Bitcoin source code has to be somehow governed. This is being governed in the most reasonable manner with a BIP process and peer-review.

If changes are proposed that do not have consensus, then these changes are not going to be adopted. Developers are free to start some alternate blockchain, but BCH devs try to dishonestly market BCH as “Bitcoin”.

Is the BCH github accessible for making changes to the source code for the whole world? I didn’t think so.

&gt; Greg Maxwell became the new lead developers, a guy who claimed he had proved bitcoin was ""mathematically impossible""

I am not sure why you bring Maxwell into the argument. Anyway, he is in fact correct that the transaction ordering problem is mathematically impossible to resolve. In case you missed it, Bitcoin makes it _more difficult_ at an exponential rate to change transaction ordering retroactively, but not _impossible_. Theoretically a sufficiently powerful miner is able to recalculate an alternate blockchain from any point in the past, therewith potentially rewriting the complete transaction history of the Bitcoin ledger.

And that was with Bitcoin ~2x the current price!! So.. everything else being the same, those fees would now be ~$25. And those were extremes!

With the economy paying those high fees,  the block reward goes up, which makes it MUCH more sexy to mine Bitcoin again. Let's assume price parity. If we pop some champaign, we come to a block reward of ~25BTC vs a block reward of ~13BCH. Which do you think is more profitable to mine?

"Well sometimes your heros become pedophiles. Should Pedophiles like the one at Penn state get a pass just because they were heroes at one point?

Ver has fallen. His online business was being disrupted because of high fees. Same with Billionaire Gambling website Calvin Ayers. Also, Bitmain would lose a $100M a year asicboost exploit. So all of them colluded along with Fake Satoshi and got a few other goons to start trashing the Legacy Bitcoin in order to promote their new Alt Coin in which they are trying to steal the brand. 

Its all really scummy. 

Why did the fees get high? Because Bitmain was spamming the network trying to fill up the blocks. Why would they want that?  because if they could get a HARD FORK to 2MB, they could keep ther AsicBoost advantage. So they Spammed the network relentlessly clogging up the blocks.  Eventually we soft forked which implemented everything including a fee market, now, Bitmain would have to pay a scaling fee for all the spam they sent.  Then like I said, all the above people had their businesses disrupted, so the disruptor said he would stop only if the Gang got on board of a Bitcoin Altcoin.

Did you miss the part where its not longer relevant because the mining difficulty is 13x greater than when that was the case?

If your argument is ""if its smaller than christmas lights then its okay"", it no longer applies. And if it doesn't matter if Bitcoin use 3-10x more energy than Christmas lights, then why even mention Christmas lights?

&gt;Well, there again, it uses quite a lot less.

It also handles far fewer transactions. A car uses less energy than a bus, it doesn't mean its more energy efficient because buses carry more people.

&gt;Feel free to do the math some time.

The math is if credit and debit cards were as efficient as 60 TWh per 250,000 x 365 transactions then credit and debit cards would be costing 183,513 TWh per year.

"&gt; two competing visions, both certainly are Bitcoin.

Except that Bitcoin is not just a vision, but real actual software that developers work on. Indisputably, the Bitcoin developers are all still working on the Bitcoin Core software, whereas the BitcoinABC (i.e., BCH) is being developed by a new, much smaller team of developers.

Also indisputably, the norm is that “Bitcoin” refers to BTC and not BCH. Trying to claim BCH is “the real Bitcoin” is not going to make it so.

"&gt; No because it isn't Bitcoin. It contains different PoW algo, different blockchain, doesn't begin at the genesis block, etc. you're reaching and the fact that youre reaching so far should say enough.

i.e.... one could say..... it has different consensus rules that make its chain invalid.

Your position is very confused. The PoW system (the difficulty rules and primitive hash function) *are* consensus rules. You said that miners can change consensus rules by mining a chain with more accumulated difficulty. They can change hash function then surely? We can compare difficulty across hash functions. The chain would just have to have more accumulated PoW to be valid.

Bitcoin Cash already changed the PoW algorithm (they changed the difficulty rules, which are the other essential component of PoW, just as important as which hash function is used, maybe more important). Without the difficulty rules, a SHA-256 hash is just a number, you've no way of knowing if there's enough 0s to be a valid PoW solution.

&gt; does matter. if you cant move your coins on the chain you want to be on, then your chain is defunct. that said, miners certainly need to keep user sentiment in mind when making decisions because that directly influences the value of their coin and thus the return on their massive investments.

Miners mine on the chain which is most valuable. Hashrate follows price. Sure, miners can split off and generate proofs of work on some other chain that users and economic nodes don't agree is bitcoin... but they'd lose a fuck load of money doing so.

&gt; no you don't. spv wallets can update.

exactly, and miners can't force them to just by hard forking. This is the crux of my point.

&gt; yes. ours. not yours. ours. not mine. ours. you can't pick and choose what i consider to be bitcoin or not. i consider bitcoin to still be described by satoshi's whitepaper.

There is not one single thing about BTC that doesn't match what's described in the whitepaper. And if you chose to view BCH as ""bitcoin"" then, by your own actions, you void your argument that ""the longest proof of work chain is Bitcoin"" since that is BTC. It's your choice whether to be logically consistent in your arguments.",1526844764
"Block lattice doesnt need to increase the hash power, because everyone has their own blockchain.  You secure your own blockchain.  Bitcoin has the issue of competition, which causes wealthy investors to work towards a controlling stake in the network.  You end up with Bitmain controlling 34% in 8 years, so 51% control is inevitable.  In the case of Bitcoin, I dont have to ask, ""is that sustainable?"", I ask, How could you possibly believe that is a secure network?  There is zero incentive for me to use my computer to secure the Bitcoin network because I will never be able to compete with Bitmain.  The incentive is not there, Bitcoin is at the mercy of the rich and powerful.

Now let's look at Dag, a dag is only at the mercy of its developers, which every single coin is.  In the case of dag though, we do not have to worry about bad actors like Bitmain, working towards network control for their greed.  Fact is, dag works, it currently works, this isnt a theory, it's a mainnet, live, working every day.",1526844723

"I've run out of time. But I'd like to share my last theory based on the clues.

The numbers and equations are a distraction. It's a process of deduction. Remove everything that isn't the Mnemonic based on clues.

There are 12 pairs of words that linguistically ""match"" making 24 total. Their order is determined by the 12 numbers in the coin and words that intersect those numbers when you draw a line. Couldn't find 10 but went with it anyway. 

After coloring the only eligible words green (blue inside the BTC symbol) I started by drawing lines through the words in the clues provided. I ignored the blue words inside the BTC because none of the three clues had any words inside the BTC.

CODE EASILY ----&gt; 1 (big number one)
ATTACK EARLY -----&gt; 2 (happens to go through no.2)
ALMOST OPEN ----&gt; 9 (line throug 9...coincidence?)

After drawing lines through the words in green to find corresponding numbers sticking strictly to those rules I ended up with something like this...(note 8, 12 were interchangeable - and 10 was nowhere to be found so I guessed with remaining words) Remember think in ""pairs"".

1 - code easily
2 - attack early
3 - agree online (consensus?)
4 - just rely 
5 - post sign
6 - pool risk
7 - cash gap
8 - old law
9 - almost open
10 - find air (lol - there's no 10!)
11 - modify course
12 - want end (end want lol)

All those words are eligible and go through those corresponding numbers which I assumed were the order.
If anyone plugs these pairs into their python script and solves it, or just solves it based on 90% of the work I've done for you, I'd settle for 50% of the prize :).

I completely agree with the Bitcoin cash method of dealing with the scaling issue the problem is the overall governance consensus mechanism that got jammed up in the first place really hasn't been dealt with.

Sure, but they have to follow consensus rules. Answer me this: if Ethereum ever reaches a state where it has a higher accumulated PoW than Bitcoin, would it *be* Bitcoin? Its chain would fit your definition. If you answer no to that question then you acknowledge that *valid* chain is important.

&gt; False. The miner can choose to build off of whatever block he desires. It's in his best financial interest to build off blocks that the majority of other miners will agree with.

Doesn't matter if the users (even those running SPV wallets) reject his chain as invalid. The consensus rules are a real thing. Sorry. That's just a fact.

&gt; No you don't.

Yes, you do. About the only consensus rule an SPV wallet can't check is block size. You can't include invalid transactions, spend coins that don't exist, etc.

And even if you were correct, you've just proved why (some) users running full validating nodes is important for the health of the network. Your position is a catch 22 that destroys your narrative either way.

&gt; No it isn't. Satoshi created Bitcoin. He wrote his whitepaper which provides a technical description/definition of Bitcoin. Especially he outlined the reasons for Bitcoin, what its goals are, and what problems it aims to solve. If Bitcoin Core no longer meets those goals or tries to solve those problems, it's not Bitcoin.

He's been gone since 2011. It's ours now. This isn't a company, just like the HTTP protocol doesn't belong to Tim Berners Lee.

&gt; If Bitcoin Core no longer meets those goals or tries to solve those problems, it's not Bitcoin.

You just defined the longest proof of work chain as ""bitcoin"" and said that that was what Satoshi intended. This is a contradiction of that point. You stated that the ""only"" thing that defines bitcoin was the most accumulated proof of work on a chain with any set of consensus rules. Now you're saying that a lesser-PoW chain can ""be bitcoin"" if it meets your subjective criteria. That seems very convenient.

&gt; tangible arguments, please.

Exactly how I feel about ""Satoshi said x"".",1526843595

"I haven't spent too much time on this, a couple of hours tops but here are my thoughts:

It doesn't really matter what's in the white paper. The concept is that the receiver of this piece of art should be able to find the answer without references.

So far the clues say think in pairs and we got a half of each pair:

Code
Easily
Attack
Early
Almost
Open

Each one is a word from BIP39 and each is from the white circle. We can find pairs for each and should solve it. I can't do this now as I'm doing it on my phone but focus on BIP39 words that are in the white circle and are BIP39 and possibly found on the canvas once

For example ""attack"" is inside a C so it's pair could be too, such as ""data""

Another option is that pair words are outside the circle.

Dan Larimer's perspective is that decentralization can be achieved with 21 independent token-holder-elected nodes far better than the PoW setup on platforms such as BTC and ETH, which may have thousands of nodes yet in reality are controlled by 4-5 mining pools. His argument is that EOS is actually more decentralized than BTC, LTC, ETH, etc. while also providing orders of magnitude better transactions-per-second, compute capacity and other features.

Vitalik's argument centers around the potential for DPoS systems to be corrupted and centralized over time and provides Lisk as an example of a DPoS network that slowly formed permanent cartel delegates. This is a valid criticism and only time will tell if EOS develops this problem. In regards to ETH, Vitalik is focused on switching ETH to a complete Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system which will eliminate the mining pool issue as fully decentralize the ETH network.

There are already many blockchain networks such as ICON, ARK, STEEM, BitShares and others that use a DPoS system similar to EOS. There are also some networks that are more tightly controlled such as XRP or NEO which oversee each of their consensus nodes. Personally I think EOS will maintain it's decentralized and censorship-resistant status due to the measures they are taking to ensure each node is independent. This includes things such as a platform constitution which every node must sign after each block, periodic token-holder voting to remove undesirable nodes and block producer capabilities to freeze bad actor nodes if multiple other nodes detect attempts to manipulate block integrity. At any rate, EOS has done a great deal more than other DPoS networks to ensure independent block producer nodes.",1526842846

"Idiot. PSD2 is the new euro banking laws you are referring to, and chainlink is psd2 compliant. Here is a nice post you should read. 

PSD2 is the primary reason I became involved with ChainLink and co-founded this subreddit. For context, I work in the Financial Services sector in the EMEA region, and I can tell you it is all about PSD2. In 2019, every European Financial Institution must provide API support for payment initiation and account enquiry made by the incoming onslaught of new Fintechs.
The banking landscape in Europe will change radically in a short period as Europeans begin to take advantage of the latest technology offered by Fintechs to meet their banking needs in today's world. Blockchain technology has come along at precisely the right time, and DLT has become almost as big of a buzz-word as Fintech itself. Also, in extraordinarily good timing comes ChainLink, a service that bridges the gap between Fintechs using DLT and Financial Institution APIs.
Behind the shiny new APIs lies the prize that SmartContract have evidently positioned themselves on - legacy payment systems that will accept nothing but the payment formats they were originally designed for. This format is likely to be the new (actually &gt;15 years old) ISO 20022 XML format. Any Fintechs wishing to make use of the new APIs can bet for sure that the Banks will not be converting formats on their behalf and instead will need to submit instructions in ISO 20022 format. Through their PoC with SWIFT, ChainLink has proven themselves as being capable of not just bridging the gap, but supporting the very formats that will run the post-PSD2 banking world.
There is a lot of speculation since the PoC about a partnership with SWIFT. For me, SWIFT has already given ChainLink something very valuable; a platform on the closed stage of the Financial Services Industry. SWIFT is seen in the sector as the keeper and enforcer of best practice for financial messaging standards so when Fintechs and Banks decide which Oracle services to use, ChainLink stands poised as a service made credible by SWIFT.
It's important to note that after the introduction of PSD2 APIs, Banks and Fintechs will not require SWIFT's telecommunications to communicate and therefore can work directly with ChainLink to connect to on-chain/off-chain data.
Often people suggest firms will just build their own oracles, but the reality is Banks will not be providing this service as, unsurprisingly, they aren't going to make the job any easier for 3rd party Fintechs. Meanwhile, Fintechs are often brand new companies who are not going to be spending their start-up funds re-writing Microsoft Outlook just because they can - they will simply engage with the industry standard oracle; ChainLink.
As you can tell, I am bullish about ChainLink. Often in crypto, the old saying about how the guy selling shovels in a gold rush is the one to get rich. Well, I believe PSD2 is another gold rush and ChainLink is the first in the door selling the shovels, the diggers, and the whole wash plant.",1526841636

"Ok some observations regarding you comments

&gt; A socialist government might come to that conclusion. A fair government would say that everyone should use electricity in proportion to what they are willing to pay for it. 
&gt;  Maybe. Who is in charge of deciding what use of electricity is “good” and what is “bad?” The truth is that a free and open market should decide.

Well, for me it is pretty easy to choose which institution should be prioritized to receive energy. Between powering a Hospital or a Bitcoin mining farm, I would choose the Hospital every single time. But that's just me. And yes, powering Christmas lights just because one can buy them at premium value, is a pretty stupid thing to do. If you can't understand that... well, let's leave it there and never to talk about it again. It's not a matter of fairness, capitalism, communism or socialism. It's just a matter of good sense and every fair choice will surely have it. 

Energy is not unlimited and it consumes resources. Bitcoin only has value if there's an underlying economy to use it. If Bitcoin mining farms start to destroy the local economies like a nuclear disaster, the local people will rebel against the miners. **It is unfortunate that capitalists and libertarians seem to be a ignorant or simply choose to ignore the reasons that powered and nourished the communist revolutions in Russia, China and other countries.**


&gt; No. The electricity consumption is controlled.
&gt; **Price of BTC goes up, average mining power goes up.**
&gt; **Price of BTC goes down, average mining power goes down. **
&gt; Thus, the hashing power is controlled by the price of Bitcoin compared to the price of electricity and computers.

I'm sorry but your statement is simply wrong and [the collected data demonstrates just that.](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-hashrate.html#1y)
See that chart which is plotting the Bitcoin network hashrate? Can you see a collapse of the network hashrate after the bitcoin crash from the ATH to 6k in January? **You cannot... because it did not happen!**

That chart proves that even in the event of a Bitcoin price crash, the hashrate can still maintain and can actually grow. **The hashrate will grow while it is still profitable to mine. That hashrate chart proves my previous statement that the [miners will mine while it is profitable for them to mine.](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-mining_profitability.html#1y)**

&gt; Tell me again why ASICs and FinFET fabric chips matter when calculating how much money will be spent on electricity for mining now and in the future?

It matters and you should already know this... It is pretty obvious, no? The smaller a transistor is, the less energy it needs to function. Smaller chips means more chips per square cm. More chips, means more hashpower per square cm. This means that by reducing the chip size, you can get more hashrate using the same amount of power. That's why we now have laptops capable of being powered during a day using only one battery charge... [But you can't reduce the size of the chip forever due to physical constraints. There's a limit.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_nanometer)

&gt; If the miners are losing money they will decrease their hashrate by retiring their older rigs. It is a simple control loop that is ultimately driven by economics, not by technology.

If a miner is loosing money, they can either:

* buy new and improved rigs which will give them more hashrate for the same power, or they can move their
* move their current rigs to a location where the miner can get cheaper electricity
* do a mix of the previous two
* sell everything and retire

"Dude, Tom Lee is definitely legit. He has a good track record of going against the grain with stock calls (which is risky in financial sell-side research) and has held a top position in JP Morgan before starting his fund. He was also partially right when he made his first crypto call of $6k by YE 2017, although of course it went much higher (whether he was right or wrong, or something in-between is up to you).

Personally, I highly respect his analytical framework and how he looks at Data. If you follow him you can hear him discuss considerations for metcalf's law, demographic behaviors, competition trends among banks/exchanges, as well as the bitcoin internal metrics like wallet growth. He also created a ""Bitcoin sentiment index"" and analyzed the possible impact of liquidity squeezes (from historic examples in oil markets), which are interesting topics. But at any rate, this is how high quality research analysts think.

Again, short term price predictions are tough and you should assess an analyst's quality based on whether you think they've constructed a credible theory based on good points..and if you're willing to bet money off it. Of course it boils down to a single number (price target by X date), and while they could be wrong, a lot more sophisticated thought goes behind a price target than some random dude off reddit so not all opinions are equal.",1526840866

"EOS will be decentralized though. There will be 21 block producers with the top 20 being voted in and the 21st randomly round robin chosen on each block.

Consensus requires 2/3 + 1 or 15 of the 21 BP's. So 15 out of 20 BP's (last spot is always rotating) or 75% of the BP's need to collude and act malicious. 

Also while I know a lot of people hate Bitfinex here, I was reading their Block Producer AMA and they are developing a voting tool on their Exchange to allow EOS holders to vote for BP's while holding their tokens on the exchange. This will help guarantee that Bitfinex isn't using their customers tokens to vote for themselves and the BP's they want. If more exchanges could develop and adopt these same voting tools it would help with the voting and decentralization of BP's for users that don't want to hold their EOS in their own wallet.

Decentralization on EOS will mainly come done to the community actively participating and voting for the BP's that have their best interest in mind and voting out any malicious actors if there are any.

I'd rather have to worry about 15 BP's somehow colluding together and staying in control than 2 or 3 mining pools colluding. Imagine if Bitmain and the chinese mining pools decide to abandon BTC and shift all hashing power to BCH. All BTC transactions would be stuck as block times take much longer than 10 minutes to mine and you have to wait 2 weeks before the difficulty readjusts.",1526840781
"&gt;If that were true BCH would not exist.

No, BCH exists because that is true :). We would have only the original Bitcoin if the majority of miners would care about long time success of the network.

And BCH was mined at the beginning only thanks to the few(!) idealists and because the price was &gt;$0 so it still brought some money

If miners wouldn't follow the chain that is the most profitable there wouldn't be so perfect correlation between BTC:BCH mining power and BTC:BCH price.

From a security perspective, you should assume that breakthrough may have already happened and you just don't know about it yet.  So everyone should have a plan in place to change their crypto on relatively short notice.

But QC doesn't really change much, the possibility exists that any crypto could be found to be fatally flawed at any time.  And again, you can't assume that such a flaw would be found by white-hats and immediately disclosed.

If you have encrypted data that you need to last 10+ years with near-absolute security, you need to be layering several different techniques so that one whole branch of cryptography being broken wide open isn't catastropic.

"There are a few problems in the whitepaper where he was vague and clarified later. He said ""the longest proof of work chain"" was bitcoin.

There are a few problems with this: it doesn't specify ""most accumulated proof of work"" just ""most blocks"". This was an actual mistake he made, he fixed it in a later commit.

The miner is limited to choosing a block to build on which will be considered valid by other nodes (i.e. it follows consensus rules). The usual BCH narrative here is ""only miners are the 'nodes' mentioned in the whitepaper, users should be using SPV wallets"".

That doesn't matter for two reasons: you have to be sure you don't break the consensus rules so thoroughly that even SPV nodes reject your blocks (some, not all consensus rules are/can-be checked by SPV wallets). So even in this (incredibly distorted from original intent) interpretation, you are still restrained by users and economic nodes as to what consensus rules you can change, thus disproving the ""it's a miner CPU-power democracy"" argument.

Secondly ""the whitepaper"" or ""satoshi said"" is a theological argument, not a technical argument, and satoshi himself would have despised being treated in this way. He put a huge amount of effort into not being a charismatic leader whose word was law.

A whitepaper is not like a constitution. It is not an eternal description of system that cannot be deviated from.

It **does not** state that no tweaks which are more optimal can ever be found.",1526839981

There may be the *tiniest* hint of validity in that description, *if* the original scaling plan had been followed, and we had simply reached a natural point where the demand for capacity outstripped the availability thereof, but actually what happened is we artificially capped it at a temporary limit to preference the business plans of a third party interest, the ego of u/nullc and the desire for the banking apparatus of the world to subvert it and use it as a weapon in the war on real cash.

Or charging bitcoin for your own goods and services.,1526839712
"The first version of the Internet was no faster than a local DMV branch, simple in approach, and mostly used for decentralized communications. Internet 2.0 is comprised of the programmable Internet that you see today, including everything from content and networks to search engines and browsers. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations are Blockchain 2.0, the “programmable version”; allowing all participants to exchange information and data on an irrefutable and distributed ledger. In doing so, it cuts out many of the traditional middlemen seen in corporations. DAO’s have the potential to create peer\-to\-peer networks utilizing self\-executing smart contracts, *independent of interpretation from outside influences*. Whatever means of exchange is used within the DAO is both meant to power smart contracts, and as a means of voting so the community can reach consensus.

While DAO’s represent a novel opportunity to disrupt many existing legacy systems, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations should also be viewed with skepticism and much of the excitement surrounding them can reasonably be described as fraudulent. While their decentralized nature promises to create an economy of the likes the world has never seen before, the vast majority of these organizations are neither decentralized nor ready for the complicated real world use cases they claim to solve. 

While many advocate for the security provided from many points of failure, a DAO’s lack of centralization could also lead to increased vulnerability. For example, when a project runs on code that is centralized at a single point, fixing the issue is as simple as solving the problem, and fixing whatever issue in the code that exists. In a truly decentralized ecosystem, each individual node needs to update its code. This becomes even more important if the issue is time sensitive. Though decentralized systems are harder to compromise, if a route for doing so is found, the results are far more dire.   

DAO’s create a tremendous amount of problems from a legal perspective as well. If investor funds are stolen through a leak or problem in the code, who is to be held accountable? Some argue it should be the programmers, while others argue in practicality, every single individual could be held accountable. \(Levine, M. \(17 May 2016\).[""](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-05-17/blockchain-company-wants-to-reinvent-companies)\) Additionally, the SEC in the United States has ruled that some of these DAO’s are illegal securities. Others promote projects claiming to be DAO’s, when in reality the parameters that can be voted on are so limited it can best be described as a ruse, or all voting tokens are under the control of the overarching organization and the system is only slightly distributed, not decentralized. Additionally,  in a true decentralized system there is no one that wants to sign paperwork for an organization that’s path is far out of his or her realm of control.

The most famous use of a complex DAO thus far took place by a company called Slock.it, which ran on the Ethereum Network. After a token sale of 150 million dollars worth of Ethereum, the team began to fund proposals and expand the network. Feeling pressure from lofty expectations, the founders of *The* *DAO,* took huge risks. However, when the codebase was debated, it was entirely flawed. A hack immediately siphoned 50 million dollars worth of investor’s Eth into a “Child DAO”. Because this represented such a large breach in the Ethereum network, the Ethereum foundation decided to step in and use their massive influence and voting power to fork the network.

This action runs contrary to the original goal of a DAO; to be independent of any formal central governing body. When the Ethereum Foundation stepped in to hard fork the network, the novelty of an autonomous decentralized organization immediately disappeared. In order for a DAO to be successful in its mission of truly being autonomous, it must be released with a strong enough foundation to stand the test of time and update to reflect necessary changes based off of voting procedures.  By stepping in to fork the network, Ethereum not only sacrificed the integrity of *The DAO,* but they also sacrificed the integrity of the entire Ethereum network. With so many Ethereum tokens locked up in *The DAO*, the Ethereum Foundation had a conflict of interest. A loss of investor funds would lead to severe problems both internally and publically and could lead many to write off their promising emerging technology. Additionally, members of the Ethereum foundation controlled 70&amp;#37; of the DAOs voting power. The voting for the fork lasted only 12 hours and made minimal effort to inform token holders. Instead of *The DAO* failing as an independent organization, it was absorbed into Ethereum. \(Price, Rob 7 June 2016\)

 This is strikingly similar to the conflicts of interest seen in 2008 during the financial crash. John Allison, the longest serving CEO of a top 25 financial institution wrote “Many of the financial institutions that should have been allowed to fail had a history of being crony capitalists; that is, these companies did not advocate limited government but instead sought special favors for themselves… Crony socialist is probably a better name for these individuals and firms,”  \(John Allison, 6\). Governments help of their friends and donors have created a precedent that allows failing institutions to continue to thrive. When the Eth team decided that *the DAO* was too big to fail, they did not allow free markets and token holders to make the best decision for the organization, they simply used their undue influence for a cyber Coup D’état. Failure should be encouraged to promote conscious investment and out of fairness to organizations that have been successful. Instead, the Ethereum Foundation abused its power and hard forked the network to help out their friends.

While *The DAO* has failed, a more simple approach has shown that it can succeed. Released in open source code in 2009, Bitcoin is a DAO in the simplest terms. Though imperfect and controlled completely miners, it has been under attack every day and has never been breached. Time has shown that its fundamental foundation is rock solid. As a result, despite being considered slow and outdated by some, Bitcoin holds nearly a majority of the crypto cap.  Investors have seen that Bitcoin is capable of running without outside interference for nearly ten years now and responded with capital infusion and investor confidence. Additionally, Bitcoins slow governance model can create confidence that the rules wont quickly be changed from under holder’s feet. Bitcoin has survived and will continue to be successful because it has remained mostly autonomous. Though, it is important to note that Bitcoin still struggles with mining decentralization due to the efficiency of ASIC processors. Bitcoin is not a traditional bank, but is certainly showing it has the capabilities to transform traditional stores of value and to be part of challenging the Federal Reserve.

With true Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, free markets will cause some to fail miserably with the strongest disrupting the worlds most important and antiquated legacy systems. Free markets of this magnitude revolved around banks during the Wildcat Banking Era from \(1837\-63\). This era, marked by extremely lax banking laws saw many banks fail and declare bankruptcy. However, the problems of one bank where not contagious to others and banks that survived conducted themselves in a manner that would not require a bailout or special favors to be successful. Additionally, the era saw increases in banks educating its customers and a general increase in knowledge regarding financial institutions \(Arthur J. Rolnick, Warren E. Weber\). John Allison would argue that this same model should to be taken by DAO’s in the future to insure we don’t have a repeat of the Federal Reserve. By allowing faulty DAO’s to fail, investors will lose their money and be incentivized to make more informed decisions.

“Exchange is the lifeblood, not only of our economy, but of our civilization itself,” \(Murray Rothbard, 1990\). For the United States and much of the world, exchange runs through a thoroughly bureaucratic and inefficient institution called the Federal Reserve. The tribulations of the Federal Reserve have caused a laundry list of problems for the entire world. Despite this, the Federal Reserve see’s no competition and has been encouraged to operate on a failing model. The overlay of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and Cryptocurrency promise to, at the very least, “bring discipline on a very discretionary organization,” \(John Allison\).

Today, the Federal Reserve of the United States no longer uses precious metal to back up its reserves. Instead, a U.S Dollar is based on the full faith of the U. S Government. In effect, the Government wants you to believe that the dollar is based on the countries GDP. The United States and many others have attempted at their own demise, to print themselves to prosperity.

Crony practices such as quantitative easing have left the world at the brink of financial ruin with the Fed even teasing the idea of negative interest rates for the next recession. \(Kenneth Rogoff, American Economic Association\) Once again, massive conflicts of interest persist. In some countries, corrupt governments who control the money supply are estimated to be worth hundreds of billions of dollars of stolen money while their citizens starve, \[The Independent\]. Meanwhile, these same Governments create social policies and minimum wages they cannot pay for. To combat that problem, they simply print more money. By overprinting money, the Fed has devalued the U. S dollar as many central banks worldwide have done in the past. This has destroyed purchasing power and made market basket goods far more expensive. Often, this type of economic meddling is a precursor for authoritarian style governments, as seen in Chavez’s Venezuela, Mugabe’s Zimbabwe, and countless other examples that clearly demonstrate the horrifying end result of central planning.

  Friedrich Hayek famously said, “Money is one of the greatest instruments of freedom ever invented by man.” Unfortunately our freedom is directly controlled by the highly discretionary and corrupt organizations of the world, central banks. A DAO for financial transactions, would increase transparency and financial freedoms in ways otherwise unimaginable. 

Bitcoin has caught the attention of both markets and governments worldwide due to its lack of a Government backing. The greatest minds spanning from Aristotle to Allison agree on what money needs to be. Durable, transferable, divisible, scarce, recognizable and fungible. “Government issued” is certainly not one of those specifications. Especially when the concept of scarcity falls of a cliff entirely. Government does not mean that governance and structure of some kind are not essential. In its current state, Bitcoin is best as a digital gold. Along with its properties of being transferable, auditable, fungible and divisible, Bitcoin is also exceptionally difficult to change. In order for a new policy to be implemented in Bitcoin, miners have to form a 95&amp;#37; consensus on it. Because the rules are unlikely to ever really change from under you, Bitcoin is best compared to digital gold with the advantages that it doesn’t require duplicate paper receipts or wheel barrels to exchange.

However Bitcoins lack of maneuverability can also lead to issues. In order to radically challenge the global monetary system, others will have to play leading roles alongside Bitcoin. In the Bitcoin network, if a consensus is not met between the different groups of miners, two forms of the same currency could be fork, IE Bitcoin Cash. Every Bitcoin Wallet is accredited with an equal amount of the new currency \(Bitcoin Cash\). These forks create many dilemmas. First and foremost, this is the equivalent of fools gold. Second, it creates unadopted competition, artificial inflation and rampant confusion leading to the loss of funds. There have been innumerable examples of people trying to use Bitcoin Cash as Bitcoin and losing their funds. At present, there are a slew of Bitcoin posers including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Private, Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcoin Gold and more likely to come. None of these are or can be accepted as Bitcoin. Additionally, the threat of a looming fork makes it extremely difficult to make the necessary changes to the protocol.

Those who validate transactions are the governing body that supports Bitcoin; the miners. As there is no salary dedicated to developers in the block reward, developers rely on donations. With these donations come conflicts of interest arise. Bitcoin has become relatively centralized and those who hold and transact the currency are not the ones who decide its fate. This is an inherently flawed system.

One project that truly shines is Decred\- a lesser\-known cryptocurrency developed from the original group of overarching founders of Bitcoin. Like Bitcoin, its creator is unknown and the coin was not distributed via an ICO. Instead, developers paid for 4&amp;#37; of the supply while another 4&amp;#37; was dealt to those who were able to solve complex puzzles via airdrop.

 Decred presents a proof of stake/proof of work hybrid form of governance. In this format, nodes stake coins and validate blocks, giving the stakers of the currency part of the block reward as pay for their work. This system allows the actual holders of the currency to decide the direction of the network because miner’s blocks cannot be confirmed without stakers approval. This system is not a democracy\- each individual staker gets voting power based off of how much skin they have in the game.

The block reward of Decred is set up so that 60&amp;#37; goes to Proof of Work miners for creating blocks, 30&amp;#37; goes to Proof of Stake miners for validating the blocks, and 10&amp;#37; goes to development for future improvements. As stakers get a portion of the Block Reward simply for staking their currency, staking coins can be a form of passive income for holders. The 10&amp;#37; development reward goes directly to the Decred Autonomous Organization. When a member of the community has an idea for an improvement to the network, they stake a fee to have his idea presented to the community on a Reddit\-like forum called Politeia. All proposals, comments, and votes and are time stamped on the blockchain to ensure transparency. Additionally, any censorship is public and a dialogue can always be publicly opened. This stops shadow banning and supports freedom of information and ideas. If members of the community vote, and decide to develop, they also vote to decide where to allocate every single cent. Through the proposal system, anything can be proposed. If members of the community feel that developers are not performing to standards, they can vote to replace them. If members of the community think a certain initiative should be taken to change the currency, for example\- privacy, it is proposed and voted on with history permanently encoded and time stamped onto the Blockchain. 

Once the new proposal for the network, is completed, miners and nodes receive a code base with the old and new code. Miners run the version of it that they prefer, signaling their vote. If 75&amp;#37; percent of the miners run the new code and have their blocks confirmed by stakers, the network uses smart contracts to automatically fork and begins to only accept transactions following the rules of the new protocol.

In effect, holders are not only investing, but are also the key role players in the organization. It is stakeholder’s final decision to decide which protocol the network should follow and that for transactions to be confirmed. Under the Howey test, it is unlikely that Decred will be considered a security. There is no investment contract and stakeholders are receiving reward for their work, not that of others.  

Additionally, the way in which tokens where distributed gave 4&amp;#37; to developers as reward for their work, and 4&amp;#37; to members of the community who worked to solve puzzles which granted access to an airdrop of Decred. Fair distribution from the beginning makes it far more likely that this project will be a success in the long term. This coin is better suited to fight ASICs and centralization and is far more autonomous than Bitcoin because developers don’t have to accept donations creating conflicts of interest. Developers and funding answers only to voting.

Like Bitcoin, Decred plans to only have 21,000,000 tokens and no Government exists to print more Decred. However, non\-traditional inflation in the form of tail emissions after the 21 millionth block is something that can be voted on by the community if they feel it is necessary. Decred maneuverability to overcome and evolve along sound, calculated development makes it primed to be another catalyst in the dismantling of central blanks worldwide.

Though money remains the most immediately rewarding and possible undertaking of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, many more promising possibilities exist. One example that springs to mind is a decentralized versions of Uber or Airbnb with, service and user being directly connected without the transfer of data, or a portion of the price transferred to a “trusted” third party. The holy grail of DAO’s is revolutionizing social media to a truly open platform that allows open communication and expression without censorship, similar to Decreds Politeia. All of this must be done without violating the privacy of its users and manipulating their brains with dopamine shots from likes, shares and comments from conforming to whatever particular status quo is beneficial politically, economically or socially to the third party running the algorithm. The Decentralized Autonomous revolution is not just about regaining control of our money or retaining our privacy, it is about returning to humans that think with the brains they are born with instead of fed. 

Central planning behind the world's most important organizations have led us down a disastrous path that will only lead to worse. Humanity has been given an opportunity to radically transform our institutions by harnessing the powers of technologies such as DAOs. The consequences of continuing down a path of irresponsible inflation and poorly disguised central planning is dire. Time after time, this has proven to be a recipe for authoritarian regimes and destroyed economies. Citizens of the United States are happy to look at the horrors of the situation of others and criticize the path they have taken to get there, when in reality, they are on an eerily similar path. Though we at the very beginning of experiments with decentralized autonomous organizations and many of their ICO’s are useless, there is reason to be cautiously optimistic about their future. Change is on the way and the revolution will bring, at the very least, competition to the highly bureaucratic, corrupt and antiquated legacy systems of the world.

There doesn’t necessarily need to be a mmj specific crypto.

None of them saw the potential to gain anything personally by accepting existing currency, so that’s the only case I can make for starting a new project versus adopting existing cryptos.  That and the prospect of a dedicated chain just for our industry (think government oversight/transparency etc).

"Thank you for your answer.

The main and only problem that I have with it is your assumption:

&gt;If you are a miner you can use some parts of your infrastructure to both host masternodes and miners.

How so? You can't host masternode on mining equipment (ASICs). Only thing you can share is your bandwidth. You would need to have additional hardware to host masternode and it doesn't matter if you are already a miner or not.
Yes, if you are a solo miner you would need a powerful node to broadcast your blocks as fast as possible and in that case you can also host masternode instead of full node. But even then 1 masternode would be enough.

Basically you based your whole argument on that assumption that is IMO false and that led to wrong conclusion.


From my experience:
1. Miners don't care about long time success of specific chain (cryptocurrency) if they can easily switch their mining power to mine something else that would be more profitable. (see miners not deciding, for many months, about increasing blocksize in BTC). I was a GPU miner and I mined whatever was more profitable at the moment and so did everyone I knew.

2. During Dash meetings I haven't met anyone that had Masternode(s) and was a professional miner (with more than 1 or 2 ASICs). Actualy I haven't met anyone with more than 2 ASICs and I have spoken with many people (that I am 99% sure) that own Masternodes.

3. ask for KYC stuff, source of funds, more stuff. Stretch this step over many days or weeks. Keep the account locked in the meantime.

The truth of the matter is Bitcoin Cash is a far closer representation of the Bitcoin whitepaper and should therefore have the better claim to the Bitcoin title. 

The private business called Blockstream usurped control over the Bitcoin Core network and are turning it into their own banking settlement layer, which means it's no longer Bitcoin. Bitcoin is peer-to-peer electronic cash.

I remember struggling when I first got into crypto in 2015, I could not understand WTF the problem was with raising the blocksize by 1mb was. There is no problem, it was all just propaganda and FUD. They link you to those unfortunate Ver videos where Ver was advantage of and lead you to believe Ver is evil, he's not. Ver is the one person in crypto you should trust, eventually with hours and hours of research (required to truly pan through all the propaganda and hate) you'll find out that Ver is pro peer-to-peer electronic Cash and thus pro Bitcoin (BCH).",1526837761

"I call myself a liberaltarian because I am kind of in the center on fiscal policies (but extremely left on social issues). I am just super fascinated by the tech and see the potential benefits of having world currencies available to everyone on the planet, where governments can’t fuck with the supply side, and nobody can stop transactions (permissionless). The idea of streaming money (possibly coined by Andreas) sounds pretty amazing as well. I follow a lot of people on Twitter who are involved with crypto, and I get annoyed at times by some of the political opinions that I don’t agree with. They have more than just one interest, so it’s unreasonable to suggest that they stop talking about non-crypto-related topics. Just ignore the stuff you don’t like or unfollow them if you can’t bear it. Every time Andreas posts something about supporting LGBT rights, he gets attacked by people who just want him to shit up and talk about crypto.

In fact, bitcoin cash is an attempt to save bitcoin as we are decentralized and not coordinated, but stronger apart.

"First, there is no plan for how IOTA will decentralize, so it's not BS.  Second making the obvious connection between believing in something blindly and religion is not a strawman, that's not even what that means.

&gt; Why do you assume Moore's law will continue and allow Bitcoin Cash to scale?

Moore's law is an observation about transistor density, nothing more.  Also cryptocurrency don't need any improvements to scale right now, any hard technical limits of bandwidth, storage or CPU usage are FAR from being approached.

&gt; Just in the past days we've learned that Bitcoin transactions with 6 confirmations can be reversed. Do you think a proven system would have such a flaw?

This is not true in any way, and it seems you have a gross misunderstanding of whatever you read as well as a general as well a total lack of understanding of probability.

Also you might want to take a step back and realize that Bitcoin is a working g decentralized system that has been under constant scrutiny for almost 10 years while continuing to work.

&gt; Those assumptions (and more) about Bitcoin are no more valid than believing IOTA will eventually grow to no longer need the coordinator

There is zero truth to this, since Bitcoin actually works right now, and there is every indication that it can scale just fine, including plenty of tests by the Bitcoin unlimited guys.  Further more, scaling is a linear extrapolation of 10 years of experience since it is literally just more of the same.  IOTA being decentralized is  faith that something that doesn't exist and no one has any idea how to do, will suddenly appear.  That is a very stupid way to invest.

"&gt;There is absolutely nothing immature about that.
I disagree.


&gt;Your rationale makes 0 sense.
How so?  Vechain is still at this point closed source and only just released their whitepaper. It may have proved itself to many who care less about the technology and more about enterprise use and real world adoption but there is still a large chunk of investors who rely on understanding a projects underlying technology and comparing it to the competitors. In this market technology is one of the only useful tools for valuation, because when you focus less on technology and more on marketing and partnerships you end up with a coin like verge. I think its fair for people to wait and see how the technology matches up against coins like Ethereum rather than go all in because DNV GL said it has solid fundamentals. And this is coming from someone who went basically all in because DNV GL said it has solid fundamentals lol. I am not bashing vechain (Although you might be because I don' really understand your point) I just want this tribalistic ""WTC bagholders on suicide watch LOLXDDDDDD"" to end because it is cancer and does nothing for the crypto community overall.

&gt;I’m sure you also don’t care about the inability to see their code..
Don't make assumptions. The closed source nature of the code will be addressed soon but it is another aspect that may just keep some people from investing. Now while I think at this point Vechain has proven themselves enough and anyone in this space should be keeping a close eye on Vechain I am not going to hate on someone just because they don't want to invest in a closed source project. And if someone decides to not invest in Vechain because its closed source why should it matter? Vechain will succeed with or without them as long as they follow through on their promises. Hating on someone just because they don't have the same coin as you is asinine.",1526836973

Daniel was one of the co-founders of the SNI but he decided to resign a while ago.

I've never claimed credit for Daniel's writings, in fact I've always gone out of my way to point out that he's the one who coined the term hyperbitcoinization. 

Michael put a lot of work into creating and maintaining the website, it's disappointing that you would disrespect that.

"I think it is more useful to avoid those outdated labels which are mostly so badly and differently understood that they create a lot of unnecessary problems. That is specially true for discussions between people with US cultural background and Europeans. 

If you compare Bitcoin to the Internet and how it developed you might observe that it was not strongly driven by intention to change the world radically, but rather to fix problems like that was too difficult and expensive to communicate between universities. 
Improving communication capabilities was not a radical political agenda but ultimately led to a world where a kid in Uganda with a smart phone has the potential capability to spread his ideas to the whole world.
The best example might be the massive online courses of universities. One of the most popular teachers there reported that at his course there have been more than 200 students who scored better than those from the University (I think it was Standford) itself. So that means that now 200 times more people have access to high quality education and using that. That potential for intellectual development was never part of an agenda of the internet but was a result of implementing a few very basic principles. Principles where nearly nobody can oppose to, like improvements of communication. To apply those principles in a radical way will lead to radical changes.

What are such principles in case of Bitcoin?
- Open source
- Transparency
- Decentralized
- Censorship resistance
- Permissionless
- Globalized

Sounds like a list of buzzwords but in fact if people take those really serious they will build something positive out of it, independent if one labels himself as ancap or socialist or whatever...",1526836192

And even without that, they can’t answer basic questions like the one I asked (and many others have asked the same question because it’s a bloody obvious question).

"That's your assertion, not fact.  The value proposition of bitcoin is in a few different things, but I'd say primarily it's the following.  Money with a defined emission rate that is deflationary, and the automation of work that was historically handled by several employees at banking establishments.  

Those key points can apply to other cryptocurrencies.  When it comes to a store of value, bitcoin is #1.  Eventually, I think when it comes to payments, bitcoin will be #1, though this is less certain.  Those are two of the most important functions a cryptocurrency can offer, which is why I expect bitcoin to remain #1.

That said, a defined emission rate that is deflationary in nature, along with automating work that was formerly done by several individuals, is something that many cryptocurrencies can offer, which allows for cheaper prices.  Not only that, but decentralization is incredibly important as well, and if you can decentralize institutions that typically hold way too much power, then you've achieved something great for humanity.  Bitcoin did that with banking.  It can be done to facebook, twitter, google, and various other networks where your data is theirs to sell.  I've already listed tons of different cryptos, doing things differently from bitcoin, that have legitimate value propositions.  So you may disagree with my arguments, you may disagree that these things are enough to survive long term, that's fine, we're speculating.  But I am not being disingenuous, my arguments are founded on reason and my own assumptions, just like everyone else's arguments.  

What I've labeled as disingenuous is that picture of 5 years ago from CMC, because cryptocurrency has moved forward ridiculously over the last 5 years, and over that time bitcoin went from high 90's in terms of dominance to high 30's, which suggests that the market recognizes the same things I've outlined here.",1526835540

Sexagesimal (base 60) is a numeral system with sixty as its base. It originated with the ancient Sumerians in the 3rd millennium BC, was passed down to the ancient Babylonians, and is still used—in a modified form—for measuring time, angles, and geographic coordinates.

The number 60, a superior highly composite number, has twelve factors, namely 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, and 60, of which 2, 3, and 5 are prime numbers. With so many factors, many fractions involving sexagesimal numbers are simplified.

When that [comparison was first made](https://coinaccess.com/blog/bitcoin-power-consumption-put-into-perspective/), Bitcoin used 4TWh a year (at least according to one middle range estimate, at that time estimates ranged from 500MWh to 30TWh), Christmas lights used 6TWh/yr.

Mining difficulty has increased by 13x since those estimates. [Now Bitcoin uses between 18TWh to 67 TWh a year](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption). That's between 3-10x more than is used on Christmas lights, even though its handling less transactions than it was when the difficulty was 13x lower.

And unless you think some currency is going to cause the abandonment of Christmas tree lights, then its not a relevant comparison. What is relevant is how much energy it uses compared to existing payment methods.

no, we can trust ""the financial incentives"" that drive miner behavior.  this is why Satoshi used the term ""honest"" 17x in the WP.  there's a subtle difference.

the only two coins that share sha256 and a common ledger since the genesis block are BCH and BTC.  those are the two i am comparing in the article and the only two i think are worth comparing.  and yes, i completely agree with you that IF miners are going to attack one of the two, they will attack the one that is more exposed to QC; and that would be BTC due to it's delayed mempools from congestion.  like i said from one of my other posts, QC will advance in qubit processing power down from times of say a year, to 6m, to 3m, to 1m, until the time when they cross that BTC mempool congestion phase of say a few weeks, wherein they will be able to attack those tx's b/c of the extra time to bruteforce a public key.

"segregated witness actually was heavily rejected by the network, for many months. They insisted on doing it as a soft fork which led to much more technical debt (which now makes it harder for newcomers and devs to understand the system and to also make any changes). More so the people who were supporting segregated witness while the miners were rejecting it started to spread lies about what it would do and why it was needed, and people started getting banned for responding to them. 


Then when it was apparent that segregated witness would never activate on it's own it was bundled with doubling the block size (AKA BIP102 which was rejected as being too conservative 4 years ago by early bitcoin users); then the people behind segregated witness said they promisoed the blocksize limit would get doubled if we would allow segregated witness to be added a month before the (easy to impliment) blocksize cap doubling. No surprise that the people who had lied for many months had lied again and they backed out of wanting the 2x part and kept their victory of sneaking in segregated wintess as a soft fork against the will of the users and miners. 


the LN is a fun idea, I remember reading part of the whitepaper in when it came out. But back then the idea was the second layers could be easily added *on top* of bitcoin's notmal use for special cases; the idea that blocks should always be full was never part of the plan at that point. 

BTC has completely corrupted bitcoin to make it almost unrecognizable from the Bitcoin I read all about and got into.

If the decentralized routing problem is ever solved and the LN works as designed there is nothing to stop many other coins from using the technology which means BTC is left with no advantage (note adding the LN does not require segregated witness) but it iwll be left with complex and unneeded code that the users never wanted and a small groupf of people forced into it.

Not really. I can't pay for items from walmart using bitcoin. 

It is especially untrue with cryptocurrencies as the person receiving payment can just send the buyer a shapeshift address which will automatic convert their payment to the currency they like. I do this all the time, as I only accept Monero as payment, but many people want to pay me in ethereaum or litecoin. 

such an act simultaneously raises the marketcap of the currency the vendor is accepting, while lowering the marketcap of the currency the buyer paid in. Such a thing will be even more dramatic when cross chain atomic swaps are possible and easily done.

"Most points you make are irrelevant. This discussion was started after you made a statement that the number of people with commit access is relevant. Whether the repository is ""in control"" of blockstream is not relevant for that question. Linus is also ""in control"" of linux, but nobody cares because he does a good job. Let's pretend for a second that the repository is in control of blockstream, why do the maintainers do a poor job?

I have repeatedly asked for examples why you think that the bitcoin core maintainers do a poor job, and so far you have only vaguely mentioned ""the blocksize debate"" without actually giving clear examples. It seems that you remember the blocksize increase as an uncontentious issue that should have been merged. But I remember the blocksize debate as a contentious change, and the maintainers have done a good job not merge such changes, regardless of whether i agree with the changes or not. If you would like to give some sources to support your claims, that would greatly help. The situation around bitcoinXT, bitcoinunlimited and segwit2x seem to support my statements that the code was not merged because it was just crap. What evidence do you have to support your statements? You gave none.

&gt; network effect

It's a piece of software without an auto updater, there is barely any network effect. Bitcoin cash wallets and ethereum wallets don't seem to suffer from this magical ""network effect"". When XT was deployed, it's node count rose quickly. When segwit2X was released, the miners quickly signaled for it. What network effect? We are not talking about consensus here.

&gt; You use the lack of a fork to draw your conclusion while ignoring the 21 billion dollar fork in the room.

This debate is about commit access to bitcoin core, not the consensus rules of bitcoin. Everybody is free to fork bitcoin core to develop an compatible client, and they probably wouldn't get censored from that. They only get censored if they have the intent to beak bitcoin compatibility.

&gt; We established that you don't mind censorship and it isn't a deal-breaker for you--you know what channels are censored because you are able to point to the ones that aren't, and you don't think censorship is a deal-breaker. I do. Prima facie, the idea of getting your anti-censhorship currency from those who actively censor is absurd.

You're making too many assumptions.

&gt; As I make points that challenge your narrative,

Indeed they do. That's why I came here to ask you to explain why it matters that the repository only has a few people with commit access, but I came away disappointed. My only possible conclusion at this point is that you only made that statement because you lack knowledge of open source development.",1526833069

*Having said all this, ongoing research into quantum resistant hashing and digital signature algorithms is deemed worthwhile if only to block the possibility altogether of reverse engineering the public keys of ECDSA and increasing the difficulty of miner hashing for the future.

"""The secret to change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new.""
-Socrates

BitCoin isn't going around destroying banks by smashing windows or rioting. It is just being itself; a decentralized, trustless, unfuckwithable yet wavy, peer-to-peer electronic cash system.  Use it or don't.

BitCoin was created to give the power of securely controlling your own finances back to the people. It is resistant to many manipulation techniques (printing money leading to inflation, denying access to funds, banks closing and taking off with your money, etc.) These tactics are used by banks and governments all over the world.

However, I feel as if Bitcoin Cash is trying to confuse future buyers into buying it instead of BTC.  Just the lies and manipulation from the BCH community is enough for me to never even look  at it's price, let alone buy any. Nevermind trying to rip off BitCoin's name.

It's almost as if the ones who print our money and write our laws see it as a threat to their greedy ways.  These opposers will try to divide and conquer it as much as they can, which explains all of the BTC FUD coming from BCH supporters.  If they truly believe in BCH, they would spend that energy helping to build, safeguard, and spread BCH, not harm BTC.

smh.....

Just like so many peaceful visionaries before including Ghandi, John Lennon, Martin Luther King, Tupac, and maybe even Jesus, BitCoin is causing people to question the way things ""have always been""

"That is exactly right. Everyone is a pin. The origin is the genesis block.  My original bitcoin address from 2011 works for both all forks. Which does not work on your ""Tree"" because the bch fork happened in August of last year.  I think it is more like [this](https://imgur.com/cfHHZeJ) .  The problem in my eyes is that Satoshi did not make things abundantly clear and then left before this madness began. Which ties into your other point about consensus. Satoshi said 1 vote 1 cpu. But obviously no one is mining with CPUs. So what else do we have to draw consensus from? NODES! Well yes of course. But at the time of the white paper everyone was running a full mining node. There were no asics... there were no non mining nodes. So who gets to vote? This is where people on the BTC side argue Community Consensus! But how do you measure that? How do you even define it? So here we are even today without consensus as to what makes bitcoin/alt coins. Without consensus as to who gets to vote.... what kind of system do we now how. If the developers agree on a proposal. But It is rejected by the  miners we have a hard fork. So in that case which fork is the 1 true bitcoin? IMO, both are bitcoin until one chain dies. ",1526830021

"This is perhaps the worst example of where China is taking blockchain. Do you think Vitalik patented Ethereum? Or Satoshi patented BTC?  It's called Bitcoin Core not Bitcoin Corp.

In the West, blockchain has grown out of Libertarian utopianism; the belief that blockchain can free use as individuals through open-source.

If it's patented then it's not open-source; if it's not open-source then it's centralized. That means wealth is directed to the patent holders.

In the West, through a rich lineage of philosophy, music and culture we celebrate individualism that is not so in China which largely adheres to Confucianism and submission to authority. 

If you want a clue to the dystopian future China could take blockchain, just Google 'China social credits'.

I don't hold NEO but I like it and I'm not into any myopic sports-team esque tribalism. NEO looks great but because of the social apathy towards personal freedoms and privacy Chinese consumers are not going to create and demand for decentralized blockchains.",1526829418

"Only one is ""Bitcoin"" because having two things with the same name is very complicated.

However, the one that becomes Bitcoin is almost arbitrary \(or at least linked to the majority\). If BCH actually had the majority they were looking for, we didn't ""add cash"" we just modified Bitcoin. People who wanted to keep the original Bitcoin would have to change their name to avoid confusion, perhaps to ""Bitcoin Classic"" \(which should sound familiar\).

The goal was never for Bitcoin to be a fixed product that can't evolve. That's literally the opposite of a decentralized vision. It should adapt to what people need as circumstances arise, whether it's a major hack that everyone wants to revert or modifications to the code to support continued growth. The limitation is purely the democratic process of getting people to switch with you.

In this regard, the Bitcoin Cash supporters are in full belief they should be the ""real"" Bitcoin \(much how Ethereum Classic wanted to be the real Ethereum\), but aren't accepting they just don't hold the majority. If they \*did\*, though, then they would absolutely be allowed to be called Bitcoin, despite whatever additions or changes they make to the source.",1526829291

"I have a PhD in crypto economics and mathematics. Crypto incentives in Chainlink are a legitimate concern. I saw Ari Juels speak at a conference recently where he mentioned tokens and asked him about the token economics of a node staking system like the Chainlink network is planning to use. The problem is that node operator incentives are fuzzy at best and not even figured out fully by the team (see the gitter for Steve stuttering about this). When I brought it up to Ari Juels, I told him that in the way the network is expected to be used, the fees payable to node operators would actually decline as requests become more ubiquitous because as the network grows it becomes cheaper to use. This makes sense if you took a few advanced cryptoeconomics courses. Ari admitted that it was a great question but that they were ""actively pursuing research in that area."" I sold my LINK immediately after that and saw a significant dump on the binance charts. It's pretty clear these guys are pulling you along making you think they're doing something revolutionary when the incentives aren't even fully determined yet.",1526829217

"A different point of view:

I'm a photographer so I work with digital photos often and it strikes me that the ""black"" background is not black.

Every color has a hex code and this particular color is:191a19

The white is just white: ffffff

There are also RGB numbers associated with these colors.

"&gt; I am claiming that consensus can never be reached if miner signalling is ignored in the name of ""community consensus"" which is impossible to measure.

Miner signalling isn't ever ignored in the case of a soft fork. A soft fork is the mechanism by which a majority of miners can agree to update consensus rules. Community consensus is something completely different.

&gt;Especially when the community is banned from discussing ideas..

Do you think if you say the same thing enough, it becomes true? I just addressed this:

&gt;&gt;Alternative methods of improvements should be openly discussed.

&gt;Absolutely, and BIP101 was allowed to be discussed. Altcoins were not allowed to be discussed.

As for

&gt;At what point does something become an altcoin? Is it prefork or post fork?

It is an altcoin as soon as it is not using rules compatible with Bitcoin consensus. If I wrote a client that uses POS starting in 1 year it would not be a Bitcoin wallet. If your wallet is designed to one day not accept the rules the vast majority of the Bitcoin network follows, then it is not a Bitcoin client.

&gt;If any fork makes an automatic altcoin and therefore censored from discussion no hardforks are allowed to happen ever. Not in the name of an emergency nor in the name of an improvement.

Sure they can happen, in cases where there was overwhelming community consensus. 

Consider the database bug where 0.7 broke consensus with other 0.7 clients. Obviously a database bug resulting in consensus being broken is something that must be fixed. The overwhelming majority of the community was fine with this relatively small change that fixed a critical vulnerability in Bitcoin.

This was a gray-area hard fork/soft fork, and the details are complex and can be discussed if you want, but it is strong evidence that a hard fork could occur if it were absolutely necessary.

Other than that, all Bitcoin consensus upgrades have been soft forks, and soft forks have worked fine for Bitcoins consensus upgrades so far.",1526828160

Invest if you want, but it doesn't in anyway challenge Chainlink.

&gt;Shitcoin/Just a meme

Github and Pivotal Tracker say otherwise. They're one of the more productive projects in all of crypto and with a smaller team than some other projects have too. The memes that have emerged around the project are largely due to boredom because its so anti-hype. LINK unironically has both the best and the worst memes in crypto, but that has nothing to do with the project so its not much of an indicator.

&gt;PSD2 Makes it Illegal

Haven't seen this one before, but its the opposite of true. PSD2 creates standardized banking APIs, which can then be integrated into blockchains via Chainlink. Not only will Chainlink not become illegal, it'll be more powerful than ever once PSD2 work is completed. Some banks are already up and running while others likely won't be until 2019. [This comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/LINKTrader/comments/7pqo5t/anyone_know_if_link_is_involved_in_the_europes/dsjn7vh) on /r/LINKTrader goes into a lot more detail about PSD2/Chainlink.

LINK is definitely undervalued and will keep being undervalued until closer to mainnet/when they start marketing the project. Almost nobody knows it even exists, and of those who do I'm sure many don't quite grasp how far reaching its use cases are. Within the next few months the market will have its ""Aha!"" moment and everyone will come rushing in all at once, just like always happens in this game (member Antshares?). Its looking like the price is likely going up from here after the low volume pullback this week so its currently sitting at a solid entry point.

Banking is vastly further from it. Centralized control of trade and commerce is the literal definition of anti\-left.

Libertarianism absolutely supports the idea of complete consolidation of power via unregulated markets.

And the american right is against government spending money to help non-rich people, but they aren't for less government power, just against government used to help people.

All politicians are for more government power, afterall it is where they get their power. Both sides of the political spectrum are just as fearful of the power of fiat money being taken away from government/central banks. The right even especially likes to support the power of central banks over people as it falls in line with their ideology of corporations over people.

There would be mass outrage if the core dev team decided to unilaterally make a hard fork change like that, especially for something as silly as adding POS. 

That's the issue with your argument, you're claiming that a client implementing an extremely controversial change, with a minority of support, **which breaks consensus and makes its tokens no longer equivalent to bitcoins**, is somehow bitcoin because a development team went forward and implemented the change and put ""Bitcoin"" in the name.

Bitcoin Gold is not Bitcoin, and it wasn't Bitcoin before it forked.

Bitcoin Cash is not Bitcoin, and it wasn't Bitcoin before it forked.

"&gt; This doesn't follow. The current developers captured the Schelling point, network effect and inertia when they captured the repo.

Again I politely disagree.

&gt; We've established BlockStream has control of the repo.

We didn't estabilish anything. You have continuously asserted that the repo is controlled by blockstream, but have given no evidence that that matters. If the repo is truly controlled by blockstream and the maintainers do a poor job, then developers will fork and abandon bitcoin core to create a new bitcoin client compatible with the bitcoin consensus rules. But since that didn't happen, the only possible explanation is that we made an incorrect assumption somewhere along the way.",1526824864
"What do you think will happen to that crypto if it ever reaches the adoption of Bitcoin? The exact same thing. Bitcoin is the only crypto, man. Everything else is just a joke.

"The hard fork when Bitcoin Cash came into being was seen by many as a reverse hard fork. There were irreconcilable differences between Bitcoin post hard fork that introduced segwit and refused to increase the block size and Bitcoin Cash that solely increased the block size as the supporters saw that as the better scaling path that followed Satoshis white paper, whereas Segwit and layer 2 scaling was not. The particular concern lay in the loss of decentralisation that may become even less with the lightning network because of the requirements Bitcoin has put on the sessions.
I do think that there is an element of land grab too and the Bitcoin Cash team should have not muddied the water by keeping the bitcoin name to prevent all the subsequent arguments that have occurred, but I think there were also a lot of proud followers that wanted to honour the Satoshi vision which also meant taking back the name from corporations that had taken over like Blockstream.",1526824681

"&gt; When you say miners, you mean a few large mining pools. That sounds a lot like central governance to me. 

It's not. Keep in mind this is only software development. The ecosystem always has been about more than software. In reality there are: miners, economic full-nodes, coin accepting merchants, users, software developers. What this does is allow miners (which are not centralized or at least not completely) to co-support software, which has *always* had an under-funding problem. This doesn't mean miners can stop volunteer (unpaid) devs from doing what they want, and the community following them. So if miners are not ultimately looking out for what the community wants they still lose.

No group rules completely. Core had centralized and overstepped the software side of Bitcoin BTC governance. Miners wanted a higher block size. Many users wanted a higher block size. Core said no.

"&gt; Originally, I thought you were advocating having a block reward of fixed size and then removing at a date in the future. That would be an extreme drop off that might kill the system. Now you are saying cutting the reward in half every 4 years is too drastic. Which is it?

I'm not advocating either, I'm pointing out flaws in the idea that ""bitcoin is the most egalitarian way to introduce a new form of money"", which is clearly bullshit. You introduced ""its not egalitarian if it works worse"" so rather than waste time arguing that concept I granted it and then thought of a new way you could still make it more egalitarian and better functioning.

&gt;I don't think anyone is claiming bitcoin is a perfect system

""This was the most egalitarian way to introduce a new form of money. He honestly was also very aware of the fact that libertarians and programmers would be the first involved and would therefore become the new wealthy elite""

From the OP, which started this whole debacle.

This is not an uncommon attitude in Bitcoin and crypto at large. ""X is going to make a tiny number of people richer than anyone else in human history, X is also the most fair and egalitarian currency system ever created, which will lift up the common man and bring down the tyrannical 1%""

That kind of blatant self-serving hypocrisy and logical inconsistency should be setting off huge alarms bells.

&gt;They will not stay in the 1% unless they continue to provide value

Why would the Winkelvoss twins ever need to work again if you believe bitcoin will continue to be deflationary? If you think Bitcoin is going to be worth $100,000,000, and they have 1,000,000 between them, and you think its going to have at least a moderate deflation rate of 1-2%, then they will be making the equivalent of 1-2 trillion dollars a year in deflationary gains, more than most nations entire GDP.

This is another example of instinctively trying to justify anything related to bitcoin as good without thinking through the logical consequences.

The only possible way to rationalize this away is if you tell yourself that bitcoin will be so efficient that actually the common man will have a very easy time making trillions of dollars of wealth a year and that we'll all be many millions of times richer than we are today.

You can't magic wealth from nowhere. If inflation is ""theft"", then deflation is equally theft in the opposite direction.

The only way you can make money from inflationary money is by using it to make money, you can't just sit on it and let other peoples work make you richer, unlike a deflationary currency, which is why deflation kills economies by rewarding rent seeking at the expense of wealth productions.

Just in the past days we've learned that Bitcoin transactions with 6 confirmations can be reversed. Do you think a proven system would have such a flaw?

Those assumptions (and more) about Bitcoin are no more valid than believing IOTA will eventually grow to no longer need the coordinator. In fact, IOTA is substantially simpler in principle than Bitcoin ever was.

"XT is an altcoin, I'll refer you to my post explaining in this same thread. Check the [context](https://archive.li/icmhK) for a more details.

The post:

&gt;Plenty of the core developers disagree about the decisions made in plenty of alternative Bitcoin clients. For example, many disagree'd with luke-jr's filter for satoshidice, however Luke's Bitcoin client is still consensus compatible, so it is still considered Bitcoin. There are disagreement with the design decisions in other wallets as well.

&gt;Here's a quick breakdown:

&gt;Clients which have the same consensus rules:

&gt; * Bitcoin Core
&gt; * Bitcoin Knots
&gt; * MSIGNA
&gt; * Armory

&gt; Clients which have different consensus rules:

&gt; * Bitcoin XT
&gt; * Bitcoin ABC (Bitcoin Cash)
&gt; * Ethereum clients
&gt; * Litecoin clients
&gt; * Monero clients

&gt; Bitcoin clients:

&gt; * Bitcoin Core
&gt; * Bitcoin. Knots
&gt; * MSIGNA
&gt; * Armory

&gt;Not Bitcoin Clients:

&gt; * Bitcoin XT
&gt; * Bitcoin ABC (Bitcoin Cash)
&gt; * Ethereum clients
&gt; * Litecoin clients
&gt; * Monero clients

&gt; You've either been misled and propagandized into a misunderstanding of what the Core developers actually believe (why not check the mailing lists, github, etc?), or you're intentionally lying. It's pretty simple, if miners can produce blocks such that I have 10BTC according to Bitcoin Core, Bticoin Knots, MSIGNA, and Armory, but I don't have 10BTC according to Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin XT is not a Bitcoin client!

&gt;&gt; ""Hardforks are the solution to contention. Hardforks are the solution to contention. This was obvious even then to anyone with any economic sense, but it is especially obvious in hindsight after the Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Monero chain splits.""

&gt; Implementations of contentious hardforks end up being altcoin clients, this is my third time explaining to you the reasoning. Altcoins are banned on /r/bitcoin, it is not an altcoin subreddit. Consensus implementations intended to cause a contentious hardfork is a consensus implementation intended to validate consensus rules for an altcoin.

And I'll give you this same question:

&gt; Let's try this thought experiment so we can see if you can come to internally consistent reasoning: Tell me why Bitcoin ABC, a miner-activated hardfork, is an altcoin client, while Bitcoin XT, a miner-activated hardfork, is a Bitcoin client.

Bitcoin is antifragile, the more is attacked, the stronger it gets. And when the age comes where quantum computers ARE a threat, both the bad guys and the good guys, and the average citizen, will have them. It'll be much like it is now. Most progress made in the hardware industry is pretty linear. Worrying about quantum computers right now is certainly a waste of energy, given that quantum computers are still in their infantile stages, and can only operate at absolute zero temperatures. (Hint: It's an extremely difficult job to find a way to bring absolute zero cooling methods to the consumer market.). While ECDSA is indeed not secure under quantum computing, quantum computers don't yet exist and probably won't for a while. The DWAVE system often written about in the press is, even if all their claims are true, not a quantum computer of a kind that could be used for cryptography.
Bitcoin's security, when used properly with a new address on each transaction, depends on more than just ECDSA: Cryptographic hashes are much stronger than ECDSA under QC. Bitcoin's security was designed to be upgraded in a forward compatible way and could be upgraded if this were considered an imminent threat.

With bitcoin you can set up a site with one image of what you are selling and a QR code for payment, and to me that is amazing.

* It makes people focus more on actual bitcoin use cases than just price bump. And this is good for Bitcoin long-term.",1526820020

"Because I have picked up on him shilling for Core &amp; Blockstream, doing same propaganda and name calling that Core, Blockstream themselves, and all of their shills, are doing. Also looking at what he was saying few years ago, before Blockstream got involved in Bitcoin, he was singing a different tune back then.

That's why. Some people son't see it, but I see it.",1526819837
If anyone I know has any interest in crypto I point them to the John Oliver piece about it. It's a good basic rundown of what's what. Even has the jargon so they're not so lost if they decide to look into it more. I also tell them they can only lose what they put in but potential gains is astronomical.,1526819750
"I sent ledger nano with custom fees. If I have to increase the fees then thats segwit out the window and if it's happening to others that 14% will not be 14% anymore. I actually don't give a shit about down votes up votes or upsetting the btc fan club. As a means of payment we all know it's a waste of time and the only benefit, if at all is the digital gold thing. 
I personally think btc is holding everything else back. These people that bang on about how great it is should move on. Yes it was great at the time but that was a few years ago so unless you can send btc for next to nothing and it arrives as you would hope it would like nano for example, then please give it a rest . Reminds me of these blokes who still buy and wear Reebok classics and have never tried another pair on coz they are the dog bollox. Sad",1526819691
"&gt;Ok they steal the private keys. But from where. Then why should my node who follows my rules be affected. You are saying that a quantum computer system is going to mysteriously steal a private key that is located on your device not the Blockchain. Let’s not be an alarmist. There is no centralized database that keeps all the private keys. The only ones that are close to it are the exchanges. 
&gt;
&gt;Next if I was going to steal anything with a quantum computer I would use it against the banking system. There is more to gain. I might false flag against crypto to get bankers talking and gloating while I’m stealing from the banking system. Or even better I’d create an account with the central banks and just create money out of thin air.  

Your whole post is a certificate of COMPLETE CLUELESSNESS.

Please read my other remark for explanations where you are wrong and why. In summary:

* You do not understand at all how Bitcoin works

* You misunderstand the role of Bitcoin exchanges

* You do not understand the basics of security and public-private key cryptography

* You do not understand quantum computers' attack vector on cryptography and Bitcoin

* You do not understand how the fiat banking system works.

You really should not be active in this space with such dramatic lack of even most basic knowledge. You really run danger of losing everything.",1526819688
"Yes but there is a huge difference having middlemen necessary vs optional. Whole point of bitcoin is having p2p transfer ability if you want it.  Makes the whole thing permissionless, open, and free.  That basically goes away with small blocks.",1526819664
"Ahh you are new to cryptocurrency.

Look at the charts of crypto. It goes up then down. Dont buy at the top of bull runs.",1526819632
"Well this is a fantastic interpretation, and I greatly appreciate it. The issue I see is in the use of the word ""asset"". In finance, that word is used when the instrument or vehicle has an underlying value that can be calculated, and is generally backed by some sort of security. Also for crypto to replace fiat, it'll have to go through the big banking institutions of the world first. By the time they let it through, it may be so twisted and manipulated that it's not what it originally was intended for. Those institutions are more powerful than anyone can imagine, and basically control human history. I may be completely wrong, but historically going up against banks, you're gonna lose. ",1526819501
"&gt; So how you suppose to know, what will happen ? 

I clearly said I don't. 

Because I don't know however, is a good reason for me to take my money out, because short-term is a shadow for me. 


I told you, there is a possiblity, and it might even be a high possiblity, who knows you're right, that Bitcoin continue to climb, despite being weak as it is. 


Possible, but according to my theory, unlikely. 



And I don't like praying. So I'm not invested, when I don't know the direction.  All of what I said makes sense to me, and if you're saying it doesn't make sense, feel free to come back and explain to me in more detail than this, how we can possibly climb higher, with a weak Bitcoin like that. 

I'm out for the moment. That's all I'm saying. 


If I'm wrong, worse case I will not yield returns from the gains, because I'm in Euro right now. My money will still be the same. 


If I'm right, I might be able to buy double the Crypto I had before. 


Only putting my thoughts out there. I invited anyone to challenge me and tell me I'm wrong. You think I wouldn't like it, if things looked different? 

You think I want to see another crash? No I don't. 

But to me it just doesn't make sense, the market functions right now. 


It all looks too much like the dotcom bubble to me. ICOs being the IPOs we had before. Wish you guys the best of luck anyways. ",1526819468
"SegWit2X was signalled by over 90% of both miners and nodes. There is no reason to separate them in this discussion.

Unless you also got into Bitcoin when it was $70 per coin, there's no way you made more profit than me selling BCH. You said me talking about gains was irrelevant and then you do it yourself.

BCH is not an altcoin it is a fork. Altcoins have their own genesis block. 
",1526819411
I wasn't implying you were a gox user. But good on you for making the right choice there. At that time so many people declared Bitcoin dead. But both you and I believed in the bitcoin project and its potential for the future. In my opinion BTC has moved away from that original trajectory but BCH is. After gox it took 3/4 years to pick back up. So as you well know 10 months is not a lot of time in the world of Bitcoin. Don't discount BCH so quickly. I hope you didn't sell it all. ,1526819376
"I disagree with Andreas on this one. BCH using the same PoW than BTC makes the hash rate volatile for both currency. 

I don't think there is a role for BCH being the silver to Bitcoin's gold, especially in a post-lightning world. However if anybody should fill (non-needed) this role it should be LTC.",1526819281
"He took bitcoin for years, way ahead of the game. I bought a couple of the shows a few years ago.",1526819232
"You are right about EOS, but your theory about btc/alts and dumping in future period, is pure BS, because you know shit where it will go. All options are open, it can go up, it can go down, it is unpredictable for now. Professional traders are deeply wrong, every chart publisher from tradingview, shorted BTC on 7k, literally everybody. Next thing happen-easy over 9k. So how you suppose to know, what will happen ? I will answer it, you don't know at all, you are just bullshiting like every other trader, only difference you are not even professional one.",1526819116
"Top 100 XRP wallets hold 98% of all the XRP.

Bitcoin Cash has a lot going for it. For example, largest merchants adoption and network effects. Lots of new developments/innovations happening (as a result of low fees)

Tell me does more than 100,000 merchants accept Nano or other coins today? I can create a new UnlimitedCoin tomorrow with no fees but what is the use of the coin if people are not accepting them?",1526819116
"&gt; Miners are required to run full nodes. So they are pretty much the same in this context.

But most nodes aren't miners. So they're not the same. Again: Consensus isn't just miners.

&gt; Besides, the only losers are the ones who are still emotionally tied to the neutered BTC.

Again, you repeat stuff that just doesn't add up. Simple math: If I sold my BCH at the right time, then I made more profit than you at this point.   
And why should I be tied to BTCI'm just stating facts. Act decent, and don't steal Bitcoin's name and websites, and I'm totally fine with your alt. In fact, I prefer alts and POS. ",1526819015
"I understand your branding argument.   Your gripes have some merit but from there other perspective, here's why:

Bitcoin core is the name of the development group who works on the BTC backend (google it).  It's the exact people who BCH are against because of forcing smaller blocks and other issues.

From that perspective, it's an apt name.   More of a slur than an attempt to rebrand BTC.",1526818688

"You will likely have fewer bitcoins. Genesis mining is not profitable. They are marketing pros but not mining professionals. They relocate a huge portion of your money towards marketing(remember the billboards). You actually make more BTC with them if you find others to buy a contract. Genesis is a service that the world doesn't need.

For example:

I trade in BTC pairs. Is there a quick formula or a calculator other than the one on CMC for calculating BTC &amp;#37; gain for setting stop sell orders? I get stuck on all being based on the SAT.

I don't quite get what you mean. Currencies are supposed to be a medium of exchange. Being a currency in of itself isn't what makes it work. Especially since high fees and slow transactions makes BTC a pretty terrible currency in its current state.

Sadly it goes far beyond just the name. The name is just the most recent chapter in a fight between big and small blockers for years now. The community could not find consensus or even consensus on how to measure consensus and so the fork happened. Then the name battle started. No one cares about Bitcoin Gold or Bitcoin Pizza because they are not actual contenders for the digital currency of the world. But because Bitcoin Cash has an actual chance people opposed for whatever reason have tried hard to push Bitcoin Cash as far away from the name and legacy of Bitcoin as possible despite the fact both BCH and BTC are bitcoin.,1526817469
You're confused with eth and btc with their miningpools ,1526817379
"&gt;  it also has the highest concentration of expert knowledge

Yes it does currently, but this is the case with all first mover projects, before another succeeds it. 

&gt;while it is improving rapidly and dragging the entire industry along with it

Yes it is developing rapidly in contrast to conventional instruments, but in contrast to the other alts aiming to supersede btc, not nearly fast enough. While ethereum is not a great analogue due to it not aiming to be a currency, would anyone have dreamed that in 12 months from it's inception it would have 50%+ the market cap of btc? The Industry being dragged along by btc I do not see as a positive right now, because there is far more significant work being done in other cryptocurrency based projects- yet the layman see only the comparatively slow behemoth of btc and it's comparatively expensive tx fees &amp; confirmation times. 

&gt;The notion that the current implementation isn't perfect, so it can't improve in the future is very obviously false- as the tech is improving every day. 

You're damn right, and at a pace and growth rate that btc cannot hope to match because of it's lack of significant central development.

&gt;It's not the first few iterations of exponential growth that jump out at you, it's the last few.

Having said what I have, if btc can somehow achieve millions of tps and near instant confirmation times, it is very likely that it will remain king. But in the likely event that it cannot, some alternative will almost certainly take it's throne.",1526817303
"&gt;On 8th August 2010 bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik wrote what could be mildly described as the biggest understatement since Apollo 13 told Houston: “We’ve had a problem here.”. “The ‘value out’ in this block is quite strange,” he wrote on bitcointalk.org, referring to a block that had somehow contained 92 billion BTC, which is precisely 91,979,000,000 more bitcoin than is ever supposed to exist. CVE-2010-5139 (CVE meaning ‘common vulnerability and exposures’) was frighteningly simple and exploited to the point of farce by an unknown attacker. In technical language, the bug is known as a number overflow error.So instead of the system counting up 98, 99, 100, 101, for example, it broke at 99 and went to zero (or -100) instead of 100. In layman’s terms, someone found a way to flood the code and create a ridiculously large amount of bitcoin in the process.

&gt;The fix was the bitcoin equivalent of dying in a video game and restarting from the last save point. The community simply hit ‘undo’, jumping back to the point in the blockchain before the hack occurred and starting anew from there; all of the transactions made after the bug was exploited – but before the fix was implemented – were effectively cancelled.

&gt;How serious was it? Bitcoin’s lead developer Wladimir Van Der Laan is pretty blunt about it, telling me: “It was the worst problem ever.”

Litecoin is not a fork, its a clone, aka a copy paste of the bitcoin repository with a different hashing function. Its not entitled to the bitcoin name because it was never a part of the original bitcoin network.",1526817232
Yes and the coin needs to have a name so ppl don’t get confused with something that already has a relatively high barrier to entry already for the layperson. Hence *Bitcoin* and Bitcoin Cash. Core has no place in the name as it’s not the coins name. ,1526817213
I disagree with Thomas. Asic boost is a tiny tiny issue compared to the block size debate. ASIC boost only affected certain mining companies and even then not a great deal (estimates vary depending on whose math you look at). The scaling debate started long before then. 2 of the original bitcoin devs Mike and Gavin proposed a block size increase. The problems pretty much started there. ,1526817187

Crypto protocols will replace national governments. Not just their fiat.  ,1526817052
"This is a serious response so don't go weird on me...but...Actually the entire premise of the Lightning Network is that the blocksize increases to roughly 130mb in size. 

This would mean that on chain fees of 1-20usd depending on congestion would be the norm and would be sufficient with this size of block to sustain mining on BTC.

If the blocksize isn't raised then BTC is basically dead in terms of a P2P cash system which was its original goal. When I asked about all of this in r/bitcoin and pointed out how a blocksize increase was literally essential I was basically told ""yeh obviously, idiot"".

But, when I asked when we will start to do this or what kind of official plan there was...nothing.

Now, I haven't fully made up my mind on this, but given how obvious it is that Lightning will TOTALLY fail with a 1mb block it seems obvious that people would ultimately determine to raise the blocksize.

This follows unless one key thing, Bitcoin is changed into ONLY a tradable store of value and P2P gold bars for rich people. This is my main concern at this point. Once the institutional money starts to enter Bitcoin the price would be going up so fast the hodlers wouldn't ever agree to risk anything by scheduling a hard fork and it would end up a consensus change to the concept of Bitcoin.

Interested to hear other's thoughts on the above.

"Man I get it, it's backed by a lot of important people. That still doesn't intrinsically show me any actual value whatsoever. When I analyze my stock portfolio, I can literally calculate whether a stock is over or undervalued, and estimate future performance using fundamental technical and sentimental analysis....I can't do that with crypto. So again I'm just waiting for someone to validate this investment!! It just seems like pure gambling to me. I already understand the value of the underlying tech, just not the coins themselves. ",1526817035
"The problem is mate, it doesn't matter, whether your Altcoin is good or bad. 

They're all pegged to Bitcoin. 


I fucking LOVE Monero. But I will lose money faster as I can wank, when BITCOIN decides to drop. You see that dynamic of everything being pegged to Bitcoin right? 


Monero, and how good they are, is absolutely irrelevant. Because Monero too will fucking dump harder than Bitcoin, if we fall. And I'm not willing to bet on Bitcoin. 


Everybody here shittalks Bitcoin. 35% dominance suggests the market likes other things better at the moment. I'm out for as long as I'm not seeing healthy signs in Bitcoin. ",1526817033

"Well, we know about derivation paths and this puzzle is hard because there is a 1 btc prize!",1526816971
The main reason public Blockchains Work is incentive. People go where the money is. If BTC was no longer profitable for miners they’d switch. Using longest chain cuz “ppl only want profits” as ur argument makes no sense. It is a *currency* that makes this work is it not? It is the profitability of the chain that draws in both the miners and investors as well which usually translate to more users overall. ,1526816935
Because the more sats you have the more bitcoin you have thus when (and I'm making assumptions here) bitcoin goes up then you'd make more money than just trading against USD/usdt etc.,1526816925
"Maybe I was misinformed and should change my statement to being that  none of the Blockstream employees are paid in 100% crypto,  while Bitcoin.com employees are paid in 100% BCH.",1526816913
"It is a slur, don't try that ""its easier to say"" bullshit. Ethereum Classic gets called by it's proper name just fine and yet it has 3 more syllables than Bitcoin Cash. It was just another play small blockers to try and retain their power over bitcoin. Bitcoin having a hard fork and taking part of the community with it threatened their hold on power and so they came up with Bcash as a way to delegitimize it.",1526816900
"Yeah I live here now, and read some Chinese crypto blogs, thus my comment. I agree with ya",1526816900
"That's not the motivation for us lefties, more righties in a leftist society. Bitcoin could stop such power grabs by the right, which is by the left should embrace it",1526816804
"35% dominance is a figure not taken from Reddit, but coinmarketcap. 

That figure to me resembles rationality in the market. And 35% is a low'ish number. Bitcoin used to always rise in value, because it was mostly the only thing to buy out there. That's no longer the case. People spread. 

People buy ICO scams. That's reality. And I'm out for as long as I have a clear picture of where we're going. The last thing I will do right now is hold an Altcoin that will make me lose all my money, if my theory is right and we're dropping even further. Not willing to lose my money at the moment. Don't see us going higher and that has nothing to do with Reddit. 


Shitcoins have no legs and it's 100% Bitcoin deciding whether the entire market goes up or down. That's the truth. ",1526816729
So we should just ignore the censorship of r\bitcoin and the massive troll armies? The destruction of Bitcoin itself through corruption or incompetence? I agree that the focus needs to lie on adoption and building but never forget how Bitcoin was sabotaged.,1526816721

First mover is great in the short term, but better projects will succeed in the longterm. BTC will not succeed at that. Friendster was a first mover, but myspace and facebook, etc came later and killed it.",1526816681
"&gt;This led me to think that Bitcoin Cash will never implement Schnoor signatures or do any radical changes to the codebase.

Schnorr signature doesn’t go against BCH philosophy AFAIK and BCH goes with 6 months HF like Monero so need for over complicated SF implementation...",1526816646
"Agreed comrade, as well as greater transparency. Replacing much of the power state has with Bitcoin could give an iteration of socialism that doesn't become a centralised power grab",1526816560
"Exactly this. Anyone can audit and see that the code is not nefarious by any means, and in crypto the code is essentially law.",1526816530
"Miners are required to run full nodes. So they are pretty much the same in this context.

The developers are mostly from Blockstream who is developing Lightning, so of course they would be against 2X. They need fees to be high so people actually have a reason to use Lightning. 

I don't have the timeline wrong I said the only reason SegWit was agreed to is because 2X was also supposed to happen. Since it didn't, SegWit should have never happened. One side got what they wanted without having to follow through with the compromise.

Also: In this context your ""you"" was directly referring to me. You said ""You lost"" as if I took some part in the block scaling debate. I did not. Besides, the only losers are the ones who are still emotionally tied to the neutered BTC.",1526816510
"Thanks for this, my friend went to a course yesterday and they recommended cloud mining and sent him a link that has a referral code included, been looking into it and came to same conclusion, they pay is usd that they convert to btc at the time and send btc, so your not earning btc, guy is giving another course in trading soon, will be going to argue with the teacher!

"**Anarchism**

Anarchism is a political philosophy that advocates self-governed societies based on voluntary institutions. These are often described as stateless societies, although several authors have defined them more specifically as institutions based on non-hierarchical or free associations. Anarchism holds the state to be undesirable, unnecessary and harmful.

While opposition to the state is central, anarchism specifically entails opposing authority or hierarchical organisation in the conduct of all human relations.

"Well, we can actually predict this to a small extent. Firstly, Bitcoin has been around for about a decade now, and has consistently increased in value. It is the world's first predictably scarce fungible asset, and therefore the value is obvious - if you want an alternative to an inflationary asset, you choose Bitcoin as your first choice, because it is completely predictable in its supply and easy to purchase.

If we assume that global growth continues (fwiw, I don't think hyperinflation will ever happen), there should always be a chunk of that product that is hedged into Bitcoin, as people cannot predict what their country's economic situation is, but Bitcoin sits outside that system and offers them an agnostic place to store value.

I don't see how volatility makes it stupid to invest, because Bitcoin is only volatile in the short term. In the long term, so far, it has smoothly followed a logarithmic price increase. People are expecting this to level out between 100k and 1M, but I disagree because world GDP growth is exponential, therefore Bitcoin will remain exponential for as long as growth is possible - which is apparently forever.",1526815531

Case in point

 - ""Facebook is censoring us. Facebook banned crypto ads. WE NEED A DECENTRALIZED SOCIAL MEDIA and SCAMCOIN_NR34 is GONNA SOLVE THIS!""

no we dont need a decentralized social media. this is the internet. without a central authority monitoring what users post, any public forum will be filled with porn, racist posts or even illegal stuff like child porn and such. Worse thing is you cant even delete those posts then, if it's in the blockchain.

"To answer OP question: 

Because investors in Crypto right now are fucking massive morons and idiots and the space is full with dumb money. That's why EOS is worth is much as they are. Because most people in the space are just dumb. 

In fact I'd argue it's better to just outright throw your money out of the window, because it's possible the wind might fly some of that money back to you. With EOS you're just bound to gradually lose it all. 


I can't fucking wait mainnet launch. It will be the biggest dump in the recent months. Hopefully that triggers some thinking for people. What if my shitcoin is as worthless as EOS? One can only hope. 


Either way, a massive dump is incoming. 


Right now they're valued more. I'm willing to bet some amounts of money, that 2 weeks after mainnet release, that will no longer be the case. 

So what should you do as investor? Short that shit. Short it on Bitmex. 


You will have your very own little bullrun there. Shorting, in Crypto, especially can be very dangerous, so I'd always suggest to short with smaller capital, and a medium leverage of 2-3 and just let that thing print you money. 


It's a worthless project, and it's worthlessness will be revealed once the thing is there and people will all point with wooden sticks at EOS, thinking ""do something now"", but it will just not be used for anything at all. ",1526815010

It is a question of perspective. For many of us the deception started years ago when was scaling methods were allowed to be openly discussed was violently silenced.

"&gt; However, BCH, while it was a great change to Bitcoin and actually addressed many of the presenting problems, the figure faces behind BCH made it untrustworthy.

Clearly only a small minority agreed BCH was a great change and that's why it is being controlled by only a few figure faces. This is why Bitcoin is resistant to unwanted changes and it's the reason why people are able to trust the code instead of a few people injecting changes that have no consensus behind them.",1526814900
"I was front runner for the german pirat party during the last federal election cycle. The german pirat party defines itself as ""social liberal"" and I can tell you I was and am holding up the left wing of that party. That being said I would debate that bitcoin (assuming hyperbitcoinization) is great from a left perspective for the following reasons:

- currently banks and wealthy people are too powerful and bitcoin (theoretically) distributes that power
- you can only lend bitcoins that you have and not have this strange demand deposits
- the interest policies by the central banking system is basically taking money from the poor and middleclass in order to refinance the government spendings without people realizing this directly
- bitcoin can become a worldwide accepted currency - uniting people over different cultural backrounds is a very left idea - and as such on the long term reduce speculation on currencies which creates more price stability for goods
- to some degree bitcoin is very similar to a ""vollgeld"" (sorry did not find a proper translation for that) system which I guess is a rather left idea.
- blockchain (not bitcoin in its current form) could easly lead to some crytocurrency which has the universal basic income as part of the protocol encoded into it helping to make distribution of wealth more equally. 

Well I guess there are more arguments. Excited to see what people will post and great question by OP.

Yes it is difficult when you hear and accept people who are your peers or people you respect say something and you take it to heart. Only later you learn maybe they didn't know any better or maybe they have their own agenda. I have no problem with people who think they can do better than Satoshi because (they) he was only human. But don't piss in my coffee and tell me its milk. If you want to change BTC to be some ultra payment network for banks and not to put banking in the hands of everyone in the world then just be honest and say so. You can not have it both ways. You can not say... we are following satoshi's true vision and in the next breath say bitcoin isn't for people who make less than $2 a day.,1526814770

"Well from what I can tell it was mainly EU members as the UK likely got cold feet and isn't getting involved in it, at least from what I've heard. However Germany is leading the effort to re-secure the deal followed by France, Italy, and a handful of others. The plan is to draft a method of preventing the Sanctions from hurting companies such as Total, but I can't exactly name all of the companies as my research hasn't gone that deep. But a trade war between the EU and US seems likely now, and also looks to be more than just about Iran when it comes to Germany, as the Nord Stream 2 project has also caught attention of Washington which has singled out Germany with threats of even further direct sanctions if it goes through with the deal.

TLDR, the US wants influence over who ever anywhere at all times, and wishes to economically siege it's rivals such as Russia/Iran despite peaceful efforts between Europeans, and will even make its ""allies"" enemies if it has to in order to maintain its Titanium Grip. As such soome countries are now eying Crypto, as well as even just dropping the Dollar for the Euro, which in Iran's case has even resulted in the *Literally immidete labeling of the Central Bank Head as a ""Terrorist""*",1526814626

Well that's exactly what vertpig is for. Somebody that likes vertcoin created a fiat pairing for vertcoin. They just created additional pairings for BTC and LTC.,1526813765
"They essentially work exactly the same way, but there are some differences.

BTC introduced a new transaction type, Segwit, which moved the transaction signatures to a different part of the block. This was done essentially because it allows for a lot of other improvements. Segwit also included a small blocksize increase, and the fee calculations was changed a bit so that transaction signatures cost less than the content of the transaction, which made Segwit cheaper transactions.

BCH was created because a lot of people did not like this transaction type, so they forked before it was activated, and pulled out the code that understood Segwit \(which had been there for a longer period but not activated\).

Now, there is also some difference in philosophy. Those who believe in BTC believes decentralization and uncensorability of the coin matters most, even more than transaction costs. Transaction costs can be kept down by increasing the blocksize to keep up, but it does raise the bar for running full  nodes \(with or without mining\), which BTC developers/users feel will incrase centralization over time, and thus making it easier to influence control over it \(censor\). Because of that, the development roadmap includes more ways to use the block space we have effectively, and usage of off\-chain solutions \(Lightning Network\) is encouraged.

Those who believe in BCH believes growth in users is the most important thing, which they feel can only happen if the coin is faster and cheaper than every other competition. Thus, they believe in raising the blocksize to keep up with demand. They also believe off\-chain shouldn't be necessary, on\-chain should be cheap enough to cover all use cases.

In the end, it's up to you what you feel is important. It's also possible to use both \- BTC for the decentralized\-ness and uncensorability as an ultimate storage of value, and then exchange to BCH \(and/or other altcoins\) for fast and cheap transactions. ",1526813752

"1. The distribution is of course impossible to know, except that at the time of the split it was exactly the same. The question lets me speculate a bit - there seem to be a bit more volatility in the price of bch contra btc, when btc goes down bch goes down more, and vice versa. Can probably not be proven, but it is a hunch. It tells me that quite a lot bch is ""locked"" with hodlers that have not decided to get rid of the bch part, or even have not bothered to establish a bch wallet yet. I would love comments on this view.

2. The mining distribution is quite the same for btc and bch, some miners mine only one side, but there is enough miners who swithc side as the mining profitability goes, leading to a balance between mining between the two. Btc has more mining than the price alone would offer, that is due to the extra reward from the fees in btc. Generally, the mining market is freer than most markets because the low barrier to entry, nobody need to ask, and it can be done all over the world so political limitations does not mean anything. Therefore each mining operation will be right-sized. Larger operations are more effective resource wise, but an overly large operation will be held down by bureaucracy. And the roles are divided between individual miners, who supply the capital, and pools, who help with the building of blocks and even out the profits over time, important for the small miner, the effect of pools on mining centralization is small in my mind, the capital is more important.

3. See above, there is no need to worry about mining centralization as long as the market is free.

"&gt; You do realize that in order to upgrade the blockchain (i. e. implementing new features) you need to change consensus and causing a hard fork

No, that is wrong, and anyone with any understanding of the history of Bitcoin would know that. Bitcoin has had a ton of consensus upgrades without hard forks, through the use of soft forks. 

^copied ^from ^a ^previous ^post ^of ^mine

Soft forks are an upgrade mechanism which satoshi has used a half dozen times, from his fix of the integer overflow attack, to his fix of the vulnerability which made it so anyone can redeem any transaction.

Soft forks have been used by the core developers to introduce P2SH (used in whats sometimes called a ""multisig address""), and the fix for the database bug in 0.7. It was also used to remove a critical vulnerability caused by open ssl not being consensus-compatible (libscpk).

Then segwit was added through a soft fork to increase the transaction throughput, decrease the size of the utxo database, and to make malleability optional.

On 8 November 2016, the Government of India announced the demonetisation of all ₹500 and ₹1000 banknotes of the Mahatma Gandhi Series. The government claimed that the action would curtail the shadow economy and crack down on the use of illicit and counterfeit cash to fund illegal activity and terrorism. The sudden nature of the announcement and the prolonged cash shortages in the weeks that followed created significant disruption throughout the economy, threatening economic output.

Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi announced the demonetisation in an unscheduled live televised address at 20:00 Indian Standard Time (IST) on 8 November.

"The problem is ""What is Bitcoin?"" I disagree with people in the BCH camp that say it is the ""real"" bitcoin. I also disagree with people in the BTC camp who say BCH isn't a version of bitcoin and that it is only an alt coin. Any coin that is a fork of the bitcoin chain that goes all the way back to the first ""genesis"" block is bitcoin. Everyone can argue until they are blue in the face over which fork is the better fork.  But saying there is only one type of bitcoin is silly. It is not a trade marked brand owned buy a company. No one owns the brand and no one has the right to claim to be THE bitcoin. Only when only 1 fork remains will there be A TRUE BITCOIN.  Most people on the BCH side are fighting to not be discounted as simply an altcoin or scam coin, though some try to say it is the one and only bitcoin. BTC people just say it is a scam. It is not a fork. It is an alt coin. etc.  I personally think BCH has the better implementation and is far more focused on adoption and making it money for everyone. Not just the wealthy.

The NSA (which also has a job of providing secure cryptography to the US while spying on everyone else) has been warning about quantum computers for a while. You can be sure that they're aware of the risk and solving it.

Depends on how quickly it happens. The easiest thing to change is web browsers (can be updated within months) and servers (a majority can realistically be patched within half a year or so once browsers say ""if you don't patch, we won't connect to you"").

Embedded devices, credit card terminals, etc. will be a mess, and for many years, will probably just rely on hope that criminals don't get access to a quantum computer, which might actually work out.

Cryptocurrency is extremely hard to patch: You will need everyone to actively move their coins under new keys, and since not all coins will be moved, you'll have to decide what happens with the non-moved ones (especially the ones with exposed pubkeys) - do you let them get stolen by the first person who gets access to a quantum computer, or do you invalidate them?

"**Instrumental convergence**

Instrumental convergence is the hypothetical tendency for most sufficiently intelligent agents to pursue certain instrumental goals such as self-preservation and resource acquisition.

Instrumental convergence suggests that an intelligent agent with apparently harmless goals can act in surprisingly harmful ways. For example, a computer with the sole goal of solving the Riemann hypothesis could attempt to turn the entire Earth into computronium in an effort to increase its computing power so that it can succeed in its calculations.

Proposed basic AI drives include utility function or goal-content integrity, self-protection, freedom from interference, self-improvement, and non-satiable acquisition of additional resources.

"**Letter frequency**

The frequency of letters in text has been studied for use in cryptanalysis, and frequency analysis in particular, dating back to the Iraqi mathematician Al-Kindi (c. 801–873 AD), who formally developed the method (the ciphers breakable by this technique go back at least to the Caesar cipher invented by Julius Caesar, so this method could have been explored in classical times).



Letter frequency analysis gained additional importance in Europe with the development of movable type in 1450 AD, where one must estimate the amount of type required for each letterform, as evidenced by the variations in letter compartment size in typographer's type cases.

Linguists use letter frequency analysis as a rudimentary technique for language identification, where it's particularly effective as an indication of whether an unknown writing system is alphabetic, syllablic, or ideographic.

[Somewhat mythical.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7rr3uq/psa_take_everything_you_read_on_bitcoincom_with_a/dszi8xn/)

&gt;he told him to raise it at some point.

Ah, ""[Satoshi says](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7zohxn/what_happened_to_all_of_the_original_developers/durfu5u/)"" again, I see.

&gt; Well, he tried with Mike Hearn with Bitcoin XT, and the censorship on /r/bitcoin and shady shit started happening.

Gavin tried to [jump immediately to 20MB blocksize limits](https://github.com/gavinandresen/bitcoin-git/commit/5f46da29fd02fd2a8a787286fd6a56f680073770) and unilaterally decided on [linear increases to over 8GB](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0101.mediawiki) over time; these ""out of a hat"" proposals were assessed as ""far too aggressive"" by basically *the entire technical community* at the time. Disappointingly, [Gavin repeatedly refused to compromise](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8iswz3/the_story_of_how_bitcoin_was_compromised/dyvseqq/) when alternative hard fork proposals like ""2MB -&gt; 4MB -&gt; 8MB over a couple of years"" were suggested.

Shortly afterwards, [a paper](http://bitfury.com/content/downloads/block-size-1.1.1.pdf) was published demonstrating that in mid-2015, limits greater than 8MB would be demonstrably destructive for the network in a number of ways. Gavin's original proposal (which, remember, [he was completely unwilling to compromise on](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8iswz3/the_story_of_how_bitcoin_was_compromised/dyvseqq/)) was proven to be a *fundamentally* terrible idea. By the time Gavin got around to supporting other, milder hard fork proposals (like the original ""Bitcoin Classic"" project), the larger Bitcoin development community had discovered and begun work increasing the blocksize with Segwit, designed to remain backwards-compatible, take elegantly into account the relevant trade-offs involved, and provide numerous other benefits for long-term scalability solutions.

Furthermore, a little known fact about the ""hard fork at all costs"" method was that it was *known* to diverge massively from Satoshi's envisioned Bitcoin maturation plan (and the social contract that was already in place and agreed upon); the alternative plan that was supposed to replace it was a far-fetched [assurance contracts](https://medium.com/@octskyward/hashing-7d04a887acc8) approach, for which there *was not* and still *is not* anything remotely resembling widespread agreement or consensus. Most people didn't even realize that this was part of Gavin and Mike's long-term strategy, because most people weren't really paying that much attention. Oh, and by the way, part of the plan was to install Mike Hearn as the """"""benevolent"""""" dictator of the codebase (another proposal for which there was *not* widespread support).

To summarize: a broken idea involving a radical deviation from the original Bitcoin formula (not to mention a total departure from decentralization) was rejected by the wider developer community, who later had their objections vindicated by further study.

&gt;and the censorship on /r/bitcoin and shady shit started happening.

Bottom line: different subreddits offer different experiences, none of them are one-size-fits-all; if you don't like one because you dislike the moderation policies enforced there, don't go there. Whining forevermore about ""censorship"" just demonstrates desperation.

&gt;Long story short, the big blockers were never given a proper platform and were shunned about even discussing their ideas.

Nonsense... if your plan is contingent upon a single subreddit, it's not a serious proposal in any meaningful sense of the word. 

&gt;Segwit2x was the last hope for a compromise between the two camps, and even that failed.

S2X was a garbage fire from start to finish. The audacity of assuming some random coalition of DCG-affiliated businesses (and co.) could in any meaningful sense represent ""consensus"" was bad enough on its own. Ironically enough, one ""Big Name"" behind S2X had [written an essay describing why it was a bad idea without realizing it](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/73mkir/shapeshift_investors_are_questioning_erik/dnrlg1t/). It totally lacked developer support, eventually culminating into [an epic flop](https://bitcointechtalk.com/segwit2x-bugs-explained-8e0c286124bc), and [oh](https://twitter.com/jfnewbery/status/931554003183431680), *[so](https://twitter.com/jfnewbery/status/931553682293972992)*, [very](https://twitter.com/oleganza/status/901952416622329856), [much](https://twitter.com/jfnewbery/status/931553723532406784), [more](https://twitter.com/jfnewbery/status/931553804109172736).

&gt;Why does the history matter?

Take note of the history I've provided here.

&gt;Because that same hostility against big blockers is STILL happening.

No one cares about how big the blocks of your altcoin are, but people who try to misleadingly pretend like their altcoin is ""Bitcoin"" are not going to be generally treated well by supporters of the actual Bitcoin.

&gt;Bitcoin Cash finally split the camps and now there are two different Bitcoins that have different scaling solutions. Saying Diamond and Gold (while still versions of Bitcoin, yes) are the same is just false, look at the community behind Bitcoin Cash and all of the new developments happening.

No, see, this is you *pretending* like your altcoin-with-an-airdrop is Bitcoin, which it's not. There are only 21M bitcoins that can ever exist, by definition, and any blockchain sporting **months** worth of *orders-of-magnitude* less cumulative proof-of-work, all while using the same work algorithm as the main network cannot (again by definition) supply any of them.

Like it or not, the market decided. Bitcoin is Bitcoin, and ""Bitcoin X"" airdrops are altcoins. That includes your precious ""Cash"" airdrop.

&gt;The scaling debate is now in the markets. Some people think 'the one true bitcoin' is BTC, others BCH, even some others BTG. It's really just a subjective thing.

Wrong, or else you're saying ""there is no finite supply cap of bitcoins"" which is definitionally absurd.

This stuff is getting so irritatingly repetitive.",1526809607

&gt;I'm not saying that BCH is completely free of scandals, as I own some of both coins. Both sides would profit greatly from the hashrate flipping/staying on their side, as Bitcoin/crypto is destined for greatness, so I'm not surprised that people fight dirty over this. However, I think that censorship is always wrong, promotes ignorance, and runs completely counter to many of the principles of cryptocurrency that drew investors in the first place.

&gt;I think it's great that BCH allowed the miners who were advocating for blocksize increase to have their peace, and that Lightning Network is finally panning out to be the fee reduction that some people were hoping for.

"The fallacy you're making doesn't seem to have an official name, but I call it the Arrow of History Fallacy. It's the idea that any new idea is automatically better or more advanced than what came before. 

A good example of why it's a fallacy is when Soviet Russia and Maoist China thought their new social organization technology they called communism was a great advancement. The Great Leap Forward resulted in tens of millions of deaths. 

Why? Because they thought the whole ""free market"" thing was just old tech. They thought they had ""smarter people"" able to manage the economy better. They went messing with things they had no understanding of. 

Strong property rights and free trade weren't just one random shot in the dark that happened to be pretty good. They were extremely close to perfect because they understood economics and incentives. 

The same has happened with the altcoins, as well as Core's insane ""full blocks"" experiments on BTC. Bitcoin was no shot in the dark. The parameters were chosen by someone who really understood and had deeply gamed out the network topology, game theory, statistical implications, economic incentives, and business realities of uncensorable cash money and even smart contracts. All these parameters like the 10-minute blocktime and long difficulty retarget are sneered at by altcoin developers who see them as easy fodder for change to make their own projects look unique. ""10 whole minutes? Why not 10 seconds??"" They don't see the long-term implications. The recent attack on Monacoin shows why short retargetting is a problem, for instance.

Almost all the supposed ""new tech"" is breaking things Bitcoin fixed, thanks to misconceptions people have about Bitcoin - many of which have been perpetuated by the Core developers themselves (though never by Satoshi, with perhaps one exception).

In truth, Bitcoin as originally designed, and as is being restored in Bitcoin Cash (BCH), is more powerful than any altcoin - not because BCH is special but because BTC and every altcoin are infected with silly ideas about scaling. BCH has the capability to do smart contracts better than Ethereum, without the need for gas, and in a *far* more scalable fashion. It can tokenize every single thing in the world for complete traceability, down to every little part in your PC. Most importantly, it can scale to terabyte blocks with no loss of decentralization, trustlessness, or security - in fact it will be vastly superior in all these areas, just because it embraces the original vision and doesn't fall prey to silly fallacies originating from Core and other people who don't grok economics, modern small-world network topology, business, or statistics.",1526807762

You’re just off track with the decentralisation thing. Just because Bitcoin needs it to function doesn’t mean I care about it. PayPal has peer to peer, that isn’t decentralised. So Bitcoin doesn’t *have* to be decentralised to offer peer to peer. 

While I know Bitcoin needs to be decentralised, at least right now, it is of no benefit to me when I have a stable FIAT that is run by a stable democratic government.

Similar to how Bitcoin Cash isn't an altcoin, it's Bitcoin, just a different implementation?

Bitcoin XT had different consensus rules, which gave miners the ability to split the network. It is incredibly unsafe to have part of the network using incompatible consensus rules indefinitely. Bitcoin is a consensus system, and if people don't agree on the rules, they won't agree on the state of the balance sheet, and people will lose money.

It's dangerous to promote it as being the same as Bitcoin, because just like Bitcoin Cash, it breaks consensus with Bitcoin under conditions decided by miners.

&gt;Hard forks can happen quite smoothly. BCH has hardforked twice already to upgrade its software.

Every time you hard fork you're invoking trust in an authority who is dictating consensus rules.

"I came into Bitcoin late and as such am neutral on the subject but the only conclusion I can reach is that BTC holders are concerned BCH will take over as the primary coins and devalue their investments. The whole drama makes no sense to me as it was obvious before the fork that BTC had become unusable and had to be fixed. The resistance really made little sense, though I understand a fear of betting on the wrong horse and seeing millions get devalued.

It is really crazy, isn't it? I guess it was bound to happen, there was in-fighting as early as 2015 about how to scale Bitcoin, and no 'consensus' was made, so BCH happened. 

Now the free market is deciding.",1526801461
"I am with you 100% on that. 
Here is the analogy I like to mention: GDAX was a mess during the bull run last year. Used to crash everytime there was decent volume. So, during this bear window coinbase is upgrading their infrastructure, to prep themselves for the upcoming bull run. 

I feel BTC should do the same thing. Increase the blocksize to 4MB. That is not big enough where it will effect the decentralization. And is big enough where when we have the next bull run, the BTC fee is not going to be ridiculous. 
Here is the problem with that (and this is my opinion) if the BTC block size is increased to 4MB, LN adoption is take wayyyyy longer that it will if the block size is 1MB. 
LN is very complicated, and we cant expect and avg user to setup a LN wallet. So, I am guessing certain ""wallet manufacturers"" will setup their LN nodes, and end users will use their LN nodes for TXs. 
Now if I can do a TX on chain with 4MB blocks for $0.50, why would I care about trying a way to find a way to use LN to have a TX fee of $0.01, that is just not worth my time and effort. 

While if my fee is $30 with 1MB block, and I can use LN to get the fee down to $0.01. Now this is a huge difference, and it is worth my time to figure out how to get access to a LN node.

This is a dangerous game BTC is playing, where it can either end very well, where LN gets widely adopted, or bad, where everyone moves on to Eth, LTC or BCH (BCH needs more trading pairs on exchanges) for transfers.",1526801321
"If I'm not mistaken EOS will have 16 nodes that are all independently operated, and those 16 nodes will vote on changes to the blockchain or something like that. Not totally centralized, but compared to most normal companies still pretty decentralized. I think projects that take a relatively centralized approach like this will have the edge, just because of how dysfunctional bitcoin development has been recently. Vechain will also only have 101 nodes at launch I think, and the foundation has hinted that that number could go up or down depending on a number of things. They *will* sacrifice decentralization for efficiency, unlike Eth. I personally like that. It'll be interesting to see how it plays out and which ones the right approach.",1526801177

"Square does payments on cell phones, tablets etc at retailers all over. Saying that, the POS is an app on the pre existing machines, but you can use the phone app to make payments or accept payments as well.  They are already approved for integration into verifone and are expected to have some news for ingenico soon. The one thing that I would say that they have over PundiX is that merchants dont need to buy their POS or update anything for graft if they already have a contract with the company, can just simply upgrade their machine. I think both projects are great and any competition is only going to make this technology better to bridge the gap between fiat and crypto payments as an every day occurance",1526801053
"Everything is a transaction.

- You buy 1 BTC at a daily market value of 20k (which means absolutely nothing to the fed) but you paid 21k for it (which is what matters). 21k for 1 BTC.
-You trade 1 BTC for x coins of another crypto. This trade is treated as such:
 -You sold 1 BTC at 10k (loss of 11k)
 -You buy x coins at 10k worth at time of exchange

Repeat this for every exchange. Every time in that case where you make a profit, the gov expects you to pay taxes. If you do not save money for that, it’s 100% your fault because the gov will expect you to. That means, if you bought 10 BTC at 1$ each, then traded 1 BTC for 20k worth of BCC, even though you exchanged it, you get 19999$ of taxable income. How much of that is taxable depends on your country and state. But then you try to sell your 20k worth of BCC back for 1 penny, well, you guessed it, that year you get to declare a loss. The year you trade the BTC for BCC, since you made a profit from the BTC sale, you’re expected to put money aside for the taxes of the profits. Last year many people got caught in that shitty situation because they didn’t know how it works. The rules are very simple and consistent.",1526800939
"&gt; No, those with merge access disagree.

I politely disagree. If you where right, then developers would have left bitcoin core.

&gt; No, those with merge access disagree. 

Again, I politely disagree.

&gt; Any information on ""the vast majority of devs"" came from the censored channels brought to you by the people who are supposedly making ""uncensorable"" money. 

My information comes from the bitcoin reddit, (both subs), the mailing list (bitcoin-dev and bitcoin-ml) and countless of talks from conferences on youtube. The majority of those are uncensored. Again, if your narrative was correct, people would leave fork bitcoin core and push a hardfork through. That has not happened.

Maybe you would like to give a few sources that the ""majority"" of the devs was in favor of a blocksize increase, because it definitely doesn't appear like that on the mailing list, it definitely doesn't appear like that on either sub, and definitely doesn't appear like that when you watch conference talks. There are developers in favor of a blocksize increase (including on /btc), but these are the minority. If it wheren't, you wouldn't see the lead dev of bitcoin ABC complain about a lack of talent while tens of world-class cryptographers are working on bitcoin core, lightning and ethereum.

Again, you need to give better arguments. 

&gt; Lightning is the largest hacker bounty ever. Private keys on always-on networked machines, with their balances publicly available. Trusting others with your private key? What a joke. All lightning manages to do is to provide a list of suckers for hackers to run exploits against.

"Okay, that's a fair argument, **however**:

Right now the LN isn't ready. It's beta software. Shouldn't Core increase the blocksize as a temporary measure so that BTC still functions for the next 18 months while the LN is maturing?

"Disclaimer: I'm a moderator of QRL (The Quantum Resistant Ledger), so take what I say with a grain of salt if you will.

The best paper in this area has been [Quantum Attacks on Bitcoin, and how to protect against them](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10377) (2017-10-28) which models the progress of gate speed, gate fidelity and overall qubits to make the statement: ""On the other hand, the elliptic curve signature scheme used by Bitcoin is much more at risk, and could be completely broken by a quantum computer as early as 2027, by the most optimistic estimates"".

From u/RareJahans 

&gt; ""If this happened. The problem wouldn't be crypto, it would be the rest of the world melting down.""

Depends on what you mean, [Post Quantum Cryptography is being standardized now](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Post-Quantum-Cryptography/Round-1-Submissions) and has been talked about in an organized fashion [for quite some time](https://pqcrypto.org/). If you've ever used Google, you may have been part of one of their [PQ Crypto experiments](https://security.googleblog.com/2016/07/experimenting-with-post-quantum.html).

In short, the people that secure our systems are preparing for it and Y2Q will probably be historically looked at in the similar vein to Y2K (an event that never happened). If you're inclined, [start integrating today](https://openquantumsafe.org/)... in the next 5 years this will likely be pretty standard stuff integrated and ready to go in whatever language you use and browser sessions everywhere. If IE11 is still a major thing 5 years from now, shoot me. It will be easier to systematically transition a centralized system than a decentralized system, so that's nice. In that way I don't think the rest of the world will be melting down but it will be business as usual, maybe (hopefully) with less political craziness.

However, I imagine there will be data leaked from people (ahem, three letter organizations) storing data that can be opened with QC's in the future, and so that will be fun. 

However likely or far out QC's may seem, my ultimate stance is that BTC should be taking QC's seriously as a black swan event, while very unlikely, would be *very* devastating to Cryptocurrency as a whole. ",1526800392
"so is BTC and the Core devs just gonna keep waiting it out and letting fees stay random as hell? No thanks. The block size getting raised has been a debate since 2014. 4 years ago. That's almost half the life of Bitcoin. Just keep on waiting for that Lightning Network!

"&gt; That's just an example of plain falsehood that you don't even notice because you want to defend BTC and trash BCH. ""Pretty soon"" is just plain false.

""Pretty soon"" is a subjective statement, so you cant call it objectively false. I consider it to be pretty soon because bitcoin is a project that will run for a looooooong time. And in 4 halvenings we'll be under 1 btc in rewards. Fees will even sooner make up a considereble fraction of the reward.

"I think BCH more closely aligns with the original vision of Bitcoin, to be a peer to peer cash for the entire world. Those $50 fees in December were... not great.

Someone living on $2 a day would never pay $1 for a transaction.

So yes, I believe BCH is Bitcoin. And that my friend, is my subjective opinion. 

Did you know Roger invested 20k into Bitcoin businesses in 2011? He's been saying the exact same thing since then, that he wants Bitcoin that the world can use. Now, sure, some people think he's Jesus or whatever - but if one person can turn you off of a project, then, well, I can't help you there. He owns a private business and can do as he pleases.
