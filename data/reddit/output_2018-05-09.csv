"&gt; If they don't need to store it permanently, how are they on blockchain? Transactions and any kind of information can't be removed from there, right?

Yes and no.  Bitshares is weird.  It seems like the bid/ask ""transactions"" are actually `proposed transactions`.  That is, they are an incomplete transaction added, kind of like adding to the mempool in Bitcoin, that can only become complete when the conditions are matched.  There seems to be some sort of on-chain *notification*, but those do not change the actual state.  I can't find any actual technical documentation on the block structure to explain how exactly this *notification* is done.

&gt; How do you measure how much is being created by bots? 

Firstly, it's pretty obvious.  Bitshares is *34th* on CMC(down from 4th in ~2014), and it's actually difficult to find much information on the ecosystem like charts.  The creator has abandoned it and no major improvements seem to be planned.  Some exchanges like Bittrex are going to or already have de-listed it.  And you're telling me that that ecosystem is pushing more transactions per day than Ethereum and that it isn't bots?  Ha Ha... Hah.

Secondly, you can actually see a lot of -bot names in the [scrolling transaction data](http://cryptofresh.com/), and three of the top 6 ""order filled"" transactors are explicitly bots, assuming [this page ever loads for you](http://cryptofresh.com/charts), not to mention that most of the other names are suspicious too(""sdr.mo2"", ""sdr.mo3"", ""sdr.mo4"" totally not bots!).

Thirdly, most of the transactions on normal exchanges are bots, both on crypto exchanges and on stock exchanges - and the vast majority of bitshares ""transactions"" are on their DEX exchange system.

&gt; Ethereum ratio for transactions: contracts was 1:49,

I don't know where you saw this because I've checked multiple blocks and didn't see anything even remotely close to that.  Further, many contracts `are also normal transactions on ethereum.`  For example, for at least some exchanges you deposit to a contract, which saves them the step of sweeping balances like on Bitcoin.  ""Contract"" payment, but clearly is a transaction - depositing substantial funds into an exchange.",1525933250

"gypsytoy¬†I don‚Äôt seem to be coming back. I basically have the same story as OP except that I went from investing everything I had (as a college student) to buy 60 BTC in 2013 and holding strong for a solid 4 years. Then having a mental health crisis during 2016 and giving 20 BTC away to strangers online who took advantage of me, never to be seen again. Then in December, days before the top, I learned what margin trading actually was. Mad a tiny bit. Lost a good amount while falling asleep during a drop and then chasing the whole thing (40 BTC) down to 0.02 BTC.

I‚Äôm beyond devastated. I‚Äôm confident that I‚Äôm going to end my life over this and I‚Äôve already begun separating myself from the world and getting my affairs in order. I feel weird revealing and admitting this on reddit, but this post hits home, as does the one of the main sub about the guy‚Äôs brother who killed himself over the same situation.
I admire those who can weather setbacks of this kind but I‚Äôm not one of them. I knew from the minute I read the white paper that Bitcoin was a game changing idea. I poured my savings into it, confident that my stack would be worth a million (20K) within 5 years (I called this almost perfectly). It‚Äôs not even like I want to live an extravagant lifestyle, I just wanted to feel financially safe for once in my life and wanted to share the wealth with those close to me and help build positive businesses and a better world. The pump and dumpers and Lamborghini memes are so obnoxious, as if the world needs any more mindless hedonistic consumerism. I grew up pretty poor and bounced from foster home to foster home and from school to school. I barely made it through college and have no marketable skills. I lost my dead end sales job a few months back and can‚Äôt bring myself to go back to barely getting buy. I held strong throughout the years, even though I could‚Äôve certainly used the money at times. I always brought my own lunch to work and always took the subway when I could instead of paying for Uber. I invested a few thousand dollars back in 2013 and never saw a penny of it. OP is much more honorable than me because I certainly don‚Äôt have the self respect to turn down donations but I‚Äôm also pretty certain that people aren‚Äôt donating to the small army of people who are in the same situation and I obviously don‚Äôt deserve it anyway. When I run into friends, they always ask about how well I must be doing because they know I‚Äôve been a Bitcoin proponent for a long time. Smiling and looking at them in the eye while talking positively about Bitcoin is incredibly taxing and I immediately want to throw up in the nearest trash can afterwards.
I know somewhere else in the universe, there‚Äôs a ‚Äòme‚Äô who decided against margin trading or stopped after a few losses or didn‚Äôt start playing bull at the beginning of a bear market. Not me though, I‚Äôm a fool and I squandered the only thing going for me in life. I hope others heed the warnings, but I know most won‚Äôt. Either way, I don‚Äôt have the type of mind to let something like this go and I can‚Äôt stand to watch Bitcoin moon again and be left behind. It‚Äôs sad that money can have such power over people. I know many have had their lives dramatically changed for the better but I suppose there are two sides to the coin.
I don‚Äôt even know why I still obsess over Bitcoin and this sub. I literally can‚Äôt think of anything else most of the time. I guess I keep hoping that it will drop to some very low amount and that I‚Äôll be able to buy back in but that doesn‚Äôt make sense because I don‚Äôt have $10 to my name to put back in. I‚Äôm going to lose my unemployment benefits and housing in a few months and really have nowhere to turn once that happens.
I know most people would pull themselves up by their bootstraps and carry on but I know that I could never escape my mind. Sorry to rant negatively on your kind and reasoned comment. I wish OP the best and he seems to have a much better attitude towards the ordeal than I do, even with the stakes being that much higher.
edit: I mostly regret posting this. I sort of figured it would get buried, didn‚Äôt realize that this thread was still pretty active and that I posted on the top comment. Thanks for the comments, PMs and kind words. I‚Äôm not in immediate danger of anything and wasn‚Äôt trying to start a pity party for myself. Nonetheless, thank you all for your concern.

"&gt;Segwit was the most stupid hack ever deployed, if you want to do a capacity increase, do it the clean way, through a clean hard fork. Instead Segwit hacks the bitcoin system to fool the old clients making them think that all blocks were under 1mb. The fact that it was sold as a transaction malleability fix was no good either, as there were clearly better hard fork solutions to fix that, core used that excuse to deploy this mess. Anyways, this is getting out of topic, it has nothing to do with what we're discussing.

Why are hard forks better? Segwit doesn't ""hack the system,"" it separates the witness data and puts it on an extension block. This is a clever and efficient way to increase transaction capacity. Also why is it not good as a malleability fix?? 

&gt;LN can and will be adopted by BCH, if it ever becomes a success and it's flaws and problems are fixed. What people were and still are against was sabotaging the network with LN promises while the network became saturated, fees rose, adoption stagnated. Adoption stagnated. I want to say this again because at some point this was the most important thing bitcoin community cared about, not lambos or any other bullshit that infests the frontpage of r/bitcoin nowadays.

Earlier on it was ""LN is never coming out and it sucks anyway."" Now that it's live, BCashers want it? That's sorta flip-floppy, yeah?

I agree that adoption or FOMO outpaced the network in December. 

&gt;You don't wait until the blocks are full to increase the block size, because the network isn't at the same level of busyness every time. Generally, transactions flood the network whenever there's a sudden spike in the price. I don't even know why I'm talking about this, the topic got out of hand.

I disagree. You don't want to raise the block limit without ensuring that the network can migrate safely without hemorrhaging nodes. Segwit and Schnorr (and other chain improvements) should be prioritized before HF block increases. 

&gt;The point I wanted to make is that we don't have two options 1) 1mb forever, 2) terrabyte blocks now! We have and had every option in between, but the small blockers refused any sort of negotiation, ridiculed the opposing view just like you did to the extreme.

That's not really true though, is it. BTC has Segwit, which effectively increases the block size. I don't understand why this wasn't enough for BCH proponents. ",1525929914

"One message for the newcomers: Have heart, the old investors have not abandoned you to hold their bags while they escaped to a life of safety. What happens during the downturns is that the veterans decide to tune out all of the noise and give their mental health a break from constantly checking the forums.

What that leaves behind, however, are all of the folks who lost a lot of money from the ATH who are ferociously anxious that they will never make that money back. Without more experienced folks reinforcing our usual mantras, it devolves into a lot of trolling from people who slowly start to become bitter over the thought that they have been scammed and hung out to dry. Eventually it festers into this subconscious belief that everyone got in too late, that crypto is dead, and that the only thing left to do is tear down other crypto enthusiasts.

But the market inevitably corrects, as it has done every single time since crypto's start. Then the good attitude returns, people are in a good mood again because everyone is making money. It takes some experience in the crypto market before you start to realize that everything is going to be fine. Just follow the rules we've repeated over an over: Don't invest more than you can lose, don't FOMO into the market, and always do your research before you buy in.",1525929237

"I am not talking about BCH blockchain, but BTC blockchain, and I'm more referring to what happened post 2015. There is no consensus on how big the blocks should be, or if there should be a cap at all in BCH community. What people generally agree is that the blockchain shouldn't be sabotaged with small blocks if there is demand for block space and no other solution.

You're saying that you don't think we can scale to 8 billions of people on chain. That is a respectable opinion, certainly there are people who think we can. However, this is a strawman, because the blocksize debate was never about scaling to 8 billion people. It was when the blocks were getting half full in normal days, so Gavin and many other proposed to increase the size before it gets full, because that's how you make capacity upgrade plans. They didn't say we should increase the blocks now to terrabyte so that we can scale to 8 billion people. This is the strawman you're pulling. Nothing is black and white, noone advocated for terrabyte blocks in 2015, but one side, the small blocker side, used this argument, as if the big blockers were saying we should have terrabyte blocks now.

&gt; BTC does have a block increase and blocks are not full and the mempool is clearing out regularly.

Were you also here in December? 35$ was the fee you had to pay to get into the block. Blocks are not full right now, because 

1) Adoption stagnated, many businesses stopped accepting, like steam or stripe.

2) FOMO ended, so we have less players coming into the space

3) More and more people keep their funds in exchanges, because they experienced the retardedly high fees so they don't want to transfer to a personal wallet, because if the price moves suddenly, they want to be able to sell.

You don't wait until the blocks are full to increase the block size, because the network isn't at the same level of busyness every time. Generally, transactions flood the network whenever there's a sudden spike in the price. I don't even know why I'm talking about this, the topic got out of hand.

"Honestly, a TL:DR doesn't really do this speech a whole lot of justice.  I'd recommend reading the whole thing but here's a list of some of the notable items:

-Regulatory agencies have been using the sandbox method to allow fintech and other companies to test new models in a safe environment and work side-by-side with regulators.

-Commissioner Pierce recommends a ""beach"" and ""lifeguard"" approach instead to allow room for innovators to work without regulators taking part in every decision.

-Regulators should take an analytical approach and review function over form in defining new instruments 

-True cryptocurrencies like bitcoin that function like money that, on their own, are unlikely to be securities.

-Utility tokens are designed to function as a means of executing a transaction.

-Tokens used for ICOs appear to be most like securities, in which first their creators use the tokens to raise funds, and subsequently the funds are used to build an environment for the coins to be used (the token has no functionality at the time of sale).

-Discussed the use of the Howe Test (1946 Supreme Court decision in SEC v. Howey, which defined a security as an investment in a common enterprise with the expectation of profits wolely through the efforts of another).

-If the coins offered in ICOs are designated as securities, their development must adhere to relevant securities laws and regulations; however, she mentions that this may stifle innovations that otherwise would have occurred without these requirements.

-Some aspects fit well inside the security definition, such as to the extent that an ICO sales the tokens to investors seekign to realize a profit from the increased value of their coins once the environemtn is created.

-She has worries about a blanket designation for all ICOs and believes the best path forward is to continue evaluate the facts and circumstances of each offering. 

-Regulators must continue to comprehend the nature of the tokens and DLT to appropriately apply the Howey test and develop a regulatory structure; be careful not to let their lack of familiarity with new technology lead to bad regulation; and, try not to control the development of new technologies.

-Recommends the SEC devote a web page to questions and comments about ICOs, tokens, distributed ledger, and other crypto concepts (email fintech@sec.gov is already set up to discuss regulatory matters)

"Should be possible to move nLockTime outside the signature of the rest of the transaction. The sender signs it separately. So a broadcasted transaction that is locked would look like {A}{B} where the ""B"" part is a separate signature of what nLockTime could be. If the receiver then wants to close the channel he'd broadcast {A}{C}, where {A} is the non-nLockTime part of the transaction and {C} is the update to nLockTime that the sender signs. The network checks if the {C} signature matches any of the outputs recorded in the {A} part and if it does they know that a receiver wants to close the channel.

This way both the sender and receiver would be able to close the channel at any time but only the sender would be able to update how much money each output should get.

Also an intersting thought in a [hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/4-alarming-reasons-ripple-might-not-be-what-you-think-9debc3c86985) article:
&gt;
The value of XRP is driven upwards by people holding the asset and believing it will be worth more in the future. Banks looking to move money across borders are not speculating. In fact, they have a disincentive to hold XRP, since they take on risk due to natural XRP volatility.

&gt;This means banks will hold XRP for the absolute minimum amount of time they can. And given the speed of the Ripple network; that time is 4 seconds. With banks‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe actual users of XRP‚Ää‚Äî‚Äänot holding onto their coins, XRP‚Äôs market cap will decrease and EVEN AT SWIFT LEVELS will only result in approximately $230 million.

False. Most banks/CUs will offer you an overpayment service where they will pay your merchant even though you don't have enough money (for the price of an NSF fee usually). Or, you could not be a goddamn moron and check your balance prior to paying a bill, or just pay with a credit card when you don't have enough to pay for your bill. 

&gt; Sure, these can be refunded sometimes but this is never a scenario with crypto.

Yeah, if you don't have enough to pay a bill you don't pay your bill. Say hello to more fees and penalties from your merchants. I talked to a guy once who told me that his workplace insurance is so hardcore that if he misses one premium payment for NSF, they turn off his health insurance. If you didn't have enough money to pay for your health insurance with cryptocurrency, then hey, no more health insurance until next year! Obviously a superior payment method right?

&gt; I cannot pull out more than $500 without upping this limit except at midnight when the service is unavailable due to banking accounting stuff.

Lmao you have a shit bank then. My bank debit card limit is $400 at the ATM, $1500 debit and $3000 credit. Your bank is absolute shit if they are only $500 lmao. 

&gt; If i want to deposit more than $1500 i have to tell them why.

PFFFFFTHAHAHAHAHA! This is laughably wrong or again, you have an intensely shit bank. Federal reporting requirements are $10,000.01 (cash only) and more. If your bank is quizzing you about $1,500 deposits, then you have a REALLY insanely shit bank. 

&gt; Sure, you dont get charged to have an account but it certainly doesnt protect from its antiquated systems or the governance requiring you to explain some of your actions with YOUR money.

Come to cryptocurrency where you can evade federal currency reporting requirements that are put into place as anti money-laundering and terrorism financing limits. Most people will never see these limits as they are $10,000.01 in cash and more. How many people do you think are going to have $10,000.01 to deposit in cash unless they're doing something illegal or very very stupid? Sure, you *can* buy a car for $15,000 in cash, but why would you when you can get a free cashier's check for the same amount, which is replaceable if it is lost or stolen?",1525924057

"I've read through the e-mail conversation now and have tried to understand the problem better. I was aware that a more restrictive replace-by-fee was in the very early Bitcoin program.

I wonder if the Bitcoin Cash devs would be open to reintroducing more strict replacement transactions. If the lock time hasn't been passed and if you can only ever increase the fee + can never change the input/output addresses I fail to see it doing any possible harm to 0-conf transactions.

The payment receiver just need to check if a seen transaction has a lock time set in the future, then it would refuse it as being a 0-conf transaction. If not it means that the transaction can never be replaced (as it is today) and the merchant can safely accept it as a 0-conf transaction.

Maybe you could even make it possible for both the sender(s) and receiver(s) to re-broadcast the same transaction at any time but with a 0 lock time, which would immediately make the transaction unchangeable from then on and it would become effective immediately (this gives all involved parties the ability to ""close the channel"" at any time).

That way if a wallet sometime, for some reason, sends a future-locked transaction to a merchant but the merchant expects a 0-conf transaction he can simply turn it into one by rebroadcasting the transaction with a 0 lock time, which makes it become active and immediately set in stone.",1525922806

-LN payments require you contributing essentially what amounts to an escrow balance like the OP described with watchtowers, they will not exist in any way that's practical unless there's a serious utility for a political use case, which there isn't.

-Merchant processing fees do exist, that's true, they average about 3%, but they are not built into the retail cost of goods in the 'short term'.

Furthermore, no retail customer wants to pay $3 extra to buy something and no vendor wants to wait a week (at a $.10 mining fee) to receive funds in a transaction.

They run Core because they currently have no other choice, at least with BTC. 

&gt; No one is forced to update their software to new crap if they don‚Äôt want, or to stick with BTC if it makes changes they don‚Äôt approve. 

I think you're confused. People are forced to run their new crap. Let me explain. For example if don't like SegWit, even if you have a previous Core client, they forced it on you because of how the soft fork process works. Even if you can't make SegWit transaction with an old Core client you're forced to accept blocks with SegWit transactions because they make it so that they look like normal transactions. So basically you have to deal with it even if you don't like or didn't approve the change you still have to let the network use your resources (node) with SegWit transactions and blocks. This is why soft forks are worse than hard forks. At least if they had implemented SegWit with a hard fork nobody would be forced to run it. Only upgraded nodes with the upgraded Core client would be able to use and validate SegWit blocks. That was the correct way to do it. But of course they knew that if they had done it that way, they would have lost the control they currently have over the network. Nobody would be running their upgraded client and other devs would have taken the previous chain and Core would've died. That's why they oppose so much to hard forks. Because they lose the chance of making unilateral decisions, yes that's right, the Core devs can do that. Just check their GitHub. Even if you go and submit a BIP (like a simple block size increase) they will reject it if it doesn't fit their narrative.

"&gt; https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/strawman

How is being concerned with block size a strawman? Strawman is when one side misrepresent's the other side's views. The example here would be if I said your side wanted blocks every 20 minutes or something like that.

How is what I said a strawman?

&gt;We're talking about BTC here not BCH. Stop deflecting. Whenever the topic of big blocks come, small blockers like you say that we can't scale to 8 billions of people on chain. This is the fallacy, because the other side isn't proposing changes to scale indefinitely on chain. The other side was simply saying that blocks were coming deadly close to the 1mb limit, and we should increase it so that the network stays functional, and in the mean time, people can work off chain solutions or whatever their favourite scaling solution is. You're purposefuly misrepresenting what big blockers advocated for, to ridicule their position and make it easier to attack.

What? I've seen numerous people here make the claims like ""there's nothing wrong with increasing blocksize indefinitely"" and ""Bitcoin should stay with Satoshi's Vision and not mess with anything else like Segwit, LN, etc. Only the original whitepaper, nothing more."" Also, this is basically Roger's stance as well.

Perhaps I'm misunderstanding what general BCH consensus is but as far as I can tell people are advocating for TB blocks and beyond, which it untenable in my view. I don't see how what I'm saying is a strawman.

&gt;You can play semantics all you want. The point is the same.

What semantics? BTC does have a block increase and blocks are not full and the mempool is clearing out regularly. What's the issue?",1525918526
Except the average bitcoin fee is 1/30 of that.,1525918455
"Nope, what's accurate is what community consensus says is accurate. That's Bitcoin Cash, BCH, and Bitcoin (BCH). Not BCC, and not BCash. Anything else causes confusion, whether or not that's intentional. Bitcoin without the BCH in parentheses also causes confusion, even though this community (including me) would like it to be called that.

Similarly, acceptable names for the chain that the Bitcoin Core client follows are Bitcoin and BTC. Bitcoin (BTC) is probably acceptable too - I haven't heard an objection to that and I use it myself sometimes. BCore is not, because that's not what their community wants to call the coin.

"Rather than debunking ""Bitcoin is killing the planet"", instead reframe the question as ""Is Bitcoin's power consumption (and by extension, carbon footprint) justified, for the reward we get?""

Every gallon of gas burned transporting cash from bank to bank does ... what, for cash? It seems a lot more pointless.",1525918302

Something I was thinking now is that both ancaps and communists recognize the big problem that is the coalition between state and big corporations. The difference between them is who they blame for that. Ancaps mainly blame the government, while communists mainly blame the big corporations.

Despite that, crypto gives some hope of attacking that system (but not necessarily destroying it completely). Even though we may disagree whether the enemy is the state or the big corporations, we agree that this technology is a great step forward against it.

In my vision, blocking off competition and adopting monopolistic practices is only possible with a state. Without a state, the free market capitalist system I described is possible, since none of the big banks can do anything to stop a common person from opening a micro-bank and freely doing business. Without a state to coercively enforce a monopoly, nothing can stop anyone from lending money to other people with a much lower interest rate than the big banks (and thus, breaking their monopolies). That's why I support the abolition of the state.",1525917983

"Come to think of it that would be a feature that would be nice to have in for example the bitcoin.com wallet. /u/MemoryDealers You specify an amount and a day (or several) every month when you want that amount to be automatically sent to an address.

The wallet gives you a single notification at the end of every day when such a payment happens where it summarize all the auto-payments that day. If your wallet is password-protected (like it should be) you'd need to set aside an amount of BCH for the auto-payment-service running in the background that only it can spend from the app's interface. To use that money like normal you'd first need to transfer it from that special wallet into your real password-protected wallet. When low on funds in the special wallet the auto-payment-service would notify the user that it soon needs a refill in order to continue the recurring payments.

It would allow people to run their own personal ""Patreon""-like service in their pocket. Even if few would use such an auto-donation / auto-payment feature it would at the very least make invalidate statements like ""recurring payments is not possible with bitcoin"".

Personally I'd love to see some creators say that they accept recurring payments with crypto as well on their Patreon pages! You'd make it so that he gets some BCH every month without me having to do anything and if he ever stops doing a good job I can just cancel the recurring auto-payment to him in the app. He would also get all of the money instead of ~90% like it is right now with fiat on Patreon.",1525917911

You're totally correct, but this system isn't stable. Under capitalism, any profit maker immediately tries to wall off any competition, and one of the methods is using the state. This is how the private FED came into existence in the first place under capitalism.

In practice capitalism always ends up encouraging accumulation, because those that accumulate get stronger, and those that refuse to or can't accumulate die off. This force is what leads to monopolies, regulatory capture (like you're talking about), and even fascism sometimes.

"&gt; Why jump through all those hoops to download brave

It only takes one click to install a browser, and BAT is not limited to Brave. 

&gt; when you can remove ALL adverts

This will never happen. The digital ad world is enormous and generates hundreds of billions of dollars each year. Major publishers will never make as much money mining crypto on their users computer as they will running ads. 

&gt; which currently is around 2 million users

This is a huge number for a beta stage browser. Brendan Eich carried Firefox to market share, so I don't expect he will have trouble with Brave.

You already described Oyster replacing all ads. Do you think Google and Facebook wont care about that? Brave is in a better position to create a mutually beneficial system for users and publishers.

"Since a malleated transaction is valid (before a consensus rule is established to invalidate them) it can be confirmed on-chain. The original TxID isn't in limbo, it's an alternate version of a now-confirmed transaction and invalid as its inputs have now been spent. The problems with this are two-fold (at least, maybe I'm forgetting some):

First, if someone is watching the chain for the confirmation of a specific TxID, it is possible that a malleatded version makes it there first. This doesn't result in the direct loss of funds, but if you have an automated system that will perform some activity - like generate and broadcast a new transaction - when the original transaction fails, it can be manipulated. This is supposedly the issue that lead to the theft of bitcoin from MtGox. For Lightning, it makes it more difficult to monitor for broadcast of a deprecated state and would require sharing an uncomfortable amount of information with third-party watchtowers.

The second problem is for subsequent unconfirmed transactions which are dependent on the outputs of the original transaction. This comes up fairly often in complex, on-chain contract scenarios. If the malleated transaction is confirmed, those dependent transactions become invalid since their inputs reference outpoints which can no longer ever be valid. This can more directly result in the loss of funds, depending on the contract design. In Lightning Network this is a particular concern in the initial channel funding construction.",1525914794
"&gt; I'm thinking of satoshis vision of 1 CPU = 1 vote, which is a cool idea in theory. To me this resembles the idea of having a society which tries to be a true democracy (or as close to it as it can reasonably be) by giving everyone the same power to influence the world. When I first read about bitcoin that's what got me interested.

Was that ever actually feasible though?

&gt;So the introduction of ASICs destroyed that. I wanted to see a system where everyone can participate and that is immune to sybill attacks. Instead we have a system that is only sybill resistant as long as the POW is in check, which uses increasingly more hashpower to work because of the incentives laid out to miners, reducing the amount of people who can participate because of decreasing profit margins kicking out people without access to cheap electricity.

Yeah this is more centralized than other systems that you can conceptualize but can those systems actually be realized? Not sure.

&gt;To keep this in check we have to make sure we don't see a miner getting 50+% of the hashpower.

Yeah, although the overall difficulty provides a check on this in terms of incentives.

&gt;At the same time the majority (?) of ASICs come from the same company, sooo.. yeah.

Yeah, not good. Changing soon, maybe?


&gt;That's what I mean when I talk about the centralization ASICs introduced. Instead of a fully decentralized open world where every person counts, we have rich people and big companies spending lots of money to get more money having a lot of power with the only incentive to not fuck everyone over because it would destroy the asset they have invested in. Which kinda works... but I don't think that satoshi wanted to design it that way.

It's still not prone to problems *if* the hashing power is substantially distributed. 

&gt;The other extreme, lots of tiny hubs: a nightmare for a user, because I don't know if I can actually pay everyone I have to pay and it is probably very challenging from a technical standpoint to find a route.

I don't think that's the case. It's my understanding that with each node connecting to 15-20 other nodes, that's a very strong and complete mesh network (assuming no hubs). I can try to dig up a source on this.


&gt;So with that in mind it seems like the whole system works best if we are somewhere between both extremes, where no aspect of it is either super amazing nor completely terrible.
So making the lightning network less centralized would carry a penalty for something else, while making it more centralized makes other aspects of it better.

I'm still not seeing the downside of having no hubs but sufficient number of channels for ordinary nodes. However, I don't see the downside of lots of hubs either.

&gt;So purely from a centralization standpoint we would have to compare every aspect of the lightning network we have to sacrifice to keep its decentralization high with all the negative aspects of increasing the block size.

I think your conception of LN is a little off. The network is a series of voluntary connections. So long as a route is available, the network works as it should. It doesn't matter if there are many hubs routing transactions or no hubs and it's all very equally-balanced P2P. The only issue I can foresee is if there are only a handful of hubs and other nodes aren't connecting directly to each other for whatever reason. This [clearly isn't what the topology looks like right now](lnmainnet.gaben.win), which is very promising.

&gt;Lets say we would come to the conclusion that the lightning network is more decentralized than big blocks, does that mean that big blocks are then automatically too centralized to be considered a solution? It comes back to question ""what is too centralized?"".

&gt;Lets say we would come to the conclusion that the lightning network is more decentralized than big blocks, does that mean that big blocks are then automatically too centralized to be considered a solution? It comes back to question ""what is too centralized?"".

You're comparing apples and oranges here. The blockchain is secured through decentralized consensus. The LN is secured via the blockchain. If LN is highly centralized (and still works as intended), nothing it lost. it's not like LN centralization hampers Bitcoin decentralization or effects its security. It's simply a layer that runs on top. Therefore, *centralization* means something very different.

&gt;We can't put decentralization above all else, because a highly decentralized project that nobody can use is kinda pointless.

The blockchain *has* to be decentralized, otherwise is can't retain store of value properties. The LN topology can take many forms and still work. There's no downward force that LN puts on Bitcoin that would cause Bitcoin to centralize (from a mining perspective)

&gt;Anyway, have to stop here. I didn't think you would respond so quickly, really have to go to bed now ;)
I will check back tomorrow.

Cheers!

In cryptography, a cold boot attack (or to a lesser extent, a platform reset attack) is a type of side channel attack in which an attacker with physical access to a computer is able to retrieve encryption keys from a running operating system after using a cold reboot to restart the machine. The attack relies on the data remanence property of DRAM and SRAM to retrieve memory contents that remain readable in the seconds to minutes after power has been removed.

"Yes. 2 things: 
1. Banks (in the USA) are federally insured. I don't think Coinbase is. So bankruptcy or theft is covered by the government for a bank.
2. Part of the fundamental guiding principle of many early Bitcoin pioneers is that the current banking system, where banks are free to lend out the money deposited, and only keep a tiny bit available for withdrawal, is immoral. It creates a danger of bank runs causing insolvency, and encourages banks to take wild risks with depositor money, knowing that they will be bailed out by the government if they go bust. The bank acts like it merely stores your money, but really, that money is gone. Some people believe that's a fundamentally unethical business model. If your money can be seized or confiscated, is it really yours?",1525913187

"This is a joke lmao. First of all whoever you copied this from doesn't even understand what Vechain is trying to do, this isn't another Bitcoin

He complains about nodes being reputable businesses and then complains about 51% attacks- WOW this couldn't possibly be more ironic. 

The entire system for selected authority nodes makes a 51% virtually impossible. This guys idea that business will collude is extremely laughable. He has no clue of the requirements to become an authority node and he thinks he's qualified to judge whether or not they'll abuse their power? 

It'd be FAR easier to pull off the following... your neighbors all put a significant amount of money in 1 house at the end of the street. You then go around, and convince 51% of the neighbors to break in and BURN their own money along with everyone else's, and pull it off without a single one of the neighbors who you approached reporting you for this plan. 

The very idea that someone with millions invested in Vechain and an entire business initiative on their platform, would not only destroy that platform, but their reputation and all the time/money spent on the initiative, create an absolute hatred towards themselves from all the other companies they screwed, become untrusted for any future partnerships... The idea that someone would even think about TRYING to organize a 51% attack- is an absolute joke...

"&gt; You aren't wrong in this argument, but a lot can be done to improve block propagation -- light blocks, graphene, other tech in the works... It's not as big of an issue as you think, but yes it is a centralizing factor.

I was simply pointing out that issues/challenges **do exist** and can't be dismissed by just saying ""it's not a problem"" as many seem to want to do.

&gt;Also, ASICs are stupidly centralizing. AntPool &amp; BTC.com are both owned by Jihan Wu, and that's over 40%ish of hashrate. ViaBTC is HEAVILY related to (and most probably owned by) JW as well. So that's well over 50% of hash rate a.k.a. full network centralization.

This is more an issue with manufacturing and availability, is it not? I thought I'd made this point above.

&gt;Also, the network is most entirely run by S9 ASIC's, which are obviously NOT open source. Who knows what backdoors are hiding in AntMiner S9's...?

For sure. But again, is this a problem with ASICs themselves or just the current iterations available and the monopoly?

&gt;Why not talk about this issue that is already here, rather than a theoretical issue much further down the line? It's almost as if Core has some ulterior motive... hmmmmmm............

"&gt; Just so I can respond more fully, what exactly are the centralizing factors you're referring to?

Concerning the introduciton of ASICs?  
I'm thinking of satoshis vision of 1 CPU = 1 vote, which is a cool idea in theory. To me this resembles the idea of having a society which tries to be a true democracy (or as close to it as it can reasonably be) by giving everyone the same power to influence the world. When I first read about bitcoin that's what got me interested.

So the introduction of ASICs destroyed that. I wanted to see a system where everyone can participate and that is immune to sybill attacks. Instead we have a system that is only sybill resistant as long as the POW is in check, which uses increasingly more hashpower to work because of the incentives laid out to miners, reducing the amount of people who can participate because of decreasing profit margins kicking out people without access to cheap electricity.

To keep this in check we have to make sure we don't see a miner getting 50+% of the hashpower. At the same time the majority (?) of ASICs come from the same company, sooo.. yeah. Nodes also lost their meaning.. or at least changed it. At first it wasn't a problem for everyone to be a mining node. Then people where running nodes, but without the mining part. Now even that seems like it lost most of its appeal. We don't need tens of thousands of non mining nodes, but only having 3 would suck. So somewhere in between there is also a point of centralization that can be discussed.

That's what I mean when I talk about the centralization ASICs introduced. Instead of a fully decentralized open world where every person counts, we have rich people and big companies spending lots of money to get more money having a lot of power with the only incentive to not fuck everyone over because it would destroy the asset they have invested in. Which kinda works... but I don't think that satoshi wanted to design it that way.

It's not really as grim as I make it out here, there are some miners that are efficient enough for an average person to run and still make some money but I think you know what I mean. There are also other systems used in other coins that do not use POW or POS to try to keep decentralization at an acceptable level, which I think is interesting. They might not work out, but at least people are still trying to figure something out.

&gt; In what way? In the sense of shortest possible routes or channel sizes or what?

I'm thinking of both extremes of decentralization and centralization of the lightning network. By that I mean the amount of hubs that exist in it.

The centralized extreme: we have only one hub and everyone is connected to it. As a user that would be nice, because I know that everyone I have to pay is connected to it, I can reach everyone without any routing problem whatsoever and it's technically very simple. Of course it has all the negatives of a centralized system, like the power the hub has to censoring transactions, dictating the prices, being shut down etc.

The other extreme, lots of tiny hubs: a nightmare for a user, because I don't know if I can actually pay everyone I have to pay and it is probably very challenging from a technical standpoint to find a route.

To me it seems like going from one extreme to the other makes every aspect gradually better or worse. There is nothing that starts of amazing, becomes terrible at one point and then amazing again at the other side of the extreme. So for example censorship resistance is terrible with one hub, but very good with tons of hubs. It's not like with 1 hub it's bad, with 100 hubs it's good but with 1000 hubs it's bad again.  
So with that in mind it seems like the whole system works best if we are somewhere between both extremes, where no aspect of it is either super amazing nor completely terrible.  
So making the lightning network less centralized would carry a penalty for something else, while making it more centralized makes other aspects of it better.

So purely from a centralization standpoint we would have to compare every aspect of the lightning network we have to sacrifice to keep its decentralization high with all the negative aspects of increasing the block size.

Lets say we would come to the conclusion that the lightning network is more decentralized than big blocks, does that mean that big blocks are then automatically too centralized to be considered a solution? It comes back to question ""what is too centralized?"".

And even if we figure that out, how can we balance introducing a higher form of centralization with the desire to implement new features? What is the priority here? We can't put decentralization above all else, because a highly decentralized project that nobody can use is kinda pointless.

Okay, I read this and I can see the point your making but I'm still not convinced why I, as a holder of BCH, and member of the community should be forced to say ""Bitcoin Cash"" instead of the shorthand (which almost everyone says), ""BCash"". Trust me, it's a way better name. Much catchier and easier to say/type. Again, not sure why you're trying to force people to not say this when it's a perfectly good and applicable shorthand (and again, it's what everyone calls it anyway). Why not just own the term, even if you somehow find it offensive? Personally, I find calling people ""BCH"" ('bitch') is offensive but it's not my place to command people to stop using the term that way or call them trolls/shills/whatever.

At the protocol level this is nonsensical. To generate a transaction it has to contain _some value_ in the nSequenceNumber fields of its inputs. Since you're building a data structure in accordance with a protocol specification, any value placed there will be done so _intentionally_. The 'opt-in' means that nodes are _supposed to_ check that the nSequenceNumber is less-than-maximum value before accepting a replacement transaction instead of simply accepting a replacement regardless of the value.

"&gt;Quick question, 
&gt;So when users decide to join the network and generate their public and private keys, does the network ‚Äúremember‚Äù or store their keys? Or maybe store the fact that it did or did not generate those keys? Otherwise how would it be known that a user is using valid addresses and how would generating replica addresses be prevented?

The network only stores transactions, but every transaction references a public key (or several) in their output, along with a set of parameters that tell the network which conditions must be met for the balance of the address to be spent. The network doesn't need to know about every address or key that's generated, only those with a transaction history (hence, the blockchain). The way the addresses are constructed is not random; the network can identify a valid vs. invalid transaction instantly (hence, the bitcoin protocol / consensus rules). The quantity of possible valid addresses is so massive that the odds of two people generating the same address twice is next-to zero. ",1525909535

"1 and 3: I've actually made a grave error in my initial calculation. The correct one has the result of 0.23 TB/Day at one billion transactions per day.   
 (1000000000 (Transactions/Day) √∑ 4200 (Transactions/Block right now)) √ó 144 (Blocks/Day) = 238095 should be the correct one.  
However, you have to consider that
- the average person makes more than a transaction per week   
- the number of transactions per block is not perfectly uniform - the blockchain has to handle traffic peaks if it wants to be a viable payment method  
- one block per ten minutes is extremely slow - imagine waiting ten minutes at your local grocery store until your transaction is cleared. One block per second should be the goal.   
Even if we ignore all of these issues, 0.23 TB per day *per miner* is enough data to knock out any small independent miner, as most residential ISPs simply don't offer that kind of speed - speaking of ISPs, they might even entirely ban Bitcoin mining on their network, as one single Bitcoin miner takes up more bandwith than thirty normal internet users.  
Bitcoin is supposed to be decentralized, and handing the entire network over to a handful of miners runs contrary to that dogma.
That's only for a billion transactions per day by the way - considering that the average person makes about ten transactions per day (factoring in automatic payments such as subscriptions or salaries), we'd be looking at 16.1 terabyte blocks if Bitcoin was the world currency. Nobody has that kind of bandwidth except Facebook, Google and the NSA.  
  
2: It'll never happen. Bitcoin has issues that go beyond scalability such as irreversibility, deflation, the fact that 20% of the total supply is in the hands of just five hundred people, electricity consumption, ease of use and requiring an internet connection that stop Bitcoin from becoming an actual currency.  
I understand that your point is ""in the future, we'll have faster internet connections"", but it will take a long, long time until the average user can download sixteen terabytes per day without congesting the network.

America however, is closer to an oligarchy: Incumbent power holds the power, does whatever they want, and has democracy at the higher levels of government, but the lowest on the chain have very poor access to democratic process.

Yes, this post is pure speculation but I just want a discussion on why you guys think we are at the beginning of crypto's version of the internet boom instead of the middle like I believe**

It seems to be general consensus across crypto that December 2017 was just the prelude to the show and that the market is going to continue to go parabolic from here. But as a newbie to this, I don't quite understand this logic.

The marketcap of the top 10 already is larger than many Fortune 500 companies. Bitcoin went x10 in 2017. This, to me, seems like the best case scenario for yearly gains, not a new norm. With some of the price predictions many experts are giving, they seem to think Bitcoin will x10-x15 from where it is now within 2 years which doesn't seem possible looking at marketcaps. 

I can already see the average marketcap of the top 30 moving 
from around 1 billion to 100 billion in the next 5 years (since Bitcoin 
is already there and ETH is almost there). But after that, I think the entire market is going to grind to a halt and it will take a very long time for the average marketcap of the top 30 to reach a trillion, compared to general sentiment now, which is that top 10 coins will have marketcaps of 500-1000 billion within 2 years, which is....unthinkable.

The next lot of ICO's will be scrutinized more than previously. Of course some people will still jump on due to FOMO but that pool of naive ""investors"" is drying out.    
Think of ICO's as stocks traded in the stock exchange. Just because there is a potential endless supply does not mean all will succeed or even begin to trade once listed.  The success of ICO's now will depend on performance and delivery.     
Bitcoin, is another beast. The value of it was and is still driven by hype, fomo and hope.

That is what most people don't see, by simply hodling and doing nothing else they are making bitcoin useless and the only function it has left is to store value, however that function to store value is driven by the fact that it will hopefully do something else as well.

Having said that, once all of these coins, tokens et al become mainstream ""the gains"" you are talking about will not come from simply hodling.

"There are many kinds of bitcoin addresses. Some minority of old addresses, usually used to consume the coinbase transaction when mining new blocks, use their literal public key as part of the address. That means the public key in its raw form exists on the blockchain when a deposit is received to an address of this type. This is called a pay to pubkey address and is distinctly different form a pay to pubkey hash address - which is the kind of address you are likely most familiar with and begins with a 1. Originally the migration from pubkey to pubkey hash addresses was due to size and usability. Hashing the pubkey makes it smaller and encoding it in base58 makes it human readable. It also turns out that hashing the pubkey means the pubkey doesn't exist on the blockchain, and so it incidentally protects almost all users from fund-stealing attacks. The only users affected by a quantum attack will be people who mined a block a very long time ago, used a pay to pubkey address, and lost the key. The quantum computers will use the public key to derive the private key and steal the coins.",1525905882

"&gt; Are you saying bigger blocks will cause longer propagation time? That I can agree with. Future upgrades like graphene will cut this down again though, so I believe people in favour of this big block strategy think that the advances in cutting down propagation time by implementing smarter techniques will balance out the overall impact on the propagation time, keeping it at an acceptable level (but probably higher than it is now?!).
&gt; 
&gt; At the same time, increasing centralization is not the problem, having a centralized system is. So the question is, at what point can bitcoin no longer be considered decentralized? And that is up for debate.

I agree with all of this. 

&gt;In my opinion, the introduction of ASICs had a huge impact on bitcoins decentralization. To a point where Im actually suprised that it still works. I kinda read satoshis quotes about it like he/she didn't expect that. Which is weird because it seems obvious that something like that would happen. Anyway, that's why your conversation turned into an ASIC discussion. It was used as an example of another thing that caused centralization.

Yeah I get why ASICs were brought up. Just so I can respond more fully, what exactly are the centralizing factors you're referring to?

&gt;Do you think that big blocks will cause too much centralization, 

Don't know. My only point was that there are many aspects to the problems introduced by big blocks. I was referring to one such issue, which I think is often overlooked. OP kept claiming I was referring to selfish mining attack (which he called an edge case, not sure what he means there)  but I wasn't. I was simply referring to the natural advantage awarded to pools of significant hashing power when blocks propagate too slowly and how this effect snowballs with each subsequent block.

&gt;or that any further centralization of the bitcoin project should be avoided at all costs?

Absolutely. Centralization should be mitigated wherever possible. Otherwise what's the point? How is sound/hard money solved for? 

&gt;I think the next step should then be to talk about the centralization aspect of lightning in contrast to the big block strategy. Because I believe that lightning works better the more centralized it is. Then we can talk about the differences in centralization they might cause and why one solution might be better than the other.

We're still a long way from even reach 8MB = N on that table (especially on BCH, which can actually accept those blocks). In fact we'd need to be consistently around 25tx/s before bandwidth requirements reach ~10Mbit/s which is the greatest obstacle for hobby-node operators.

To put that into perspective, BTC in the late 2017 mania was averaging around 15tx/s when the mempool collapsed, IIRC.

"the most significant factor in determining any one coins price is the USD value of BTC, thats just the way it is right now.

therefore the majority of significant price movements of your coins can be explained by swings of BTC

this makes keeping track of your portfolio difficult if you only look at USD value, you're constantly having to check to see if BTC went up or down to establish how much of your coins movements were of it's own achievements or failures.

Instead of trying to compare it this way, it is far easier and clearer to just measure your portfolio in terms of satoshis, and thereby eliminating the swings of the market as a whole.",1525903737

No true Scotsman or appeal to purity is an informal fallacy in which one attempts to protect a universal generalization from counterexamples by changing the definition in an ad hoc fashion to exclude the counterexample. Rather than denying the counterexample or rejecting the original claim, this fallacy modifies the subject of the assertion to exclude the specific case or others like it by rhetoric, without reference to any specific objective rule (""no true Scotsman would do such a thing""; i.e., those who perform that action are not part of our group and thus criticism of that action is not criticism of the group).

1)  Bitcoin Cash was on 30+ exchanges since their founding on Aug 1st.   Another exchange added them and probably leaked the info.  

You do realize that the Bitcoin Cash does not control who uses their platform and definitely not who uses it and might leak it early.

"I'll put in my input just so you can get a better grasp at what Cardano is attempting to do and why it is indeed very special in the crypto world and is tackling a lot more than those coins you mentioned.

* Charles and his team at IOHK is very open about their progress and does [weekly technical reports](https://www.cardano.org/en/weekly-technical-reports/) and [monthly roadmap updates](https://cardanoroadmap.com/), so that's why everyone who follows Charles and IOHK knows what they're working on. Also, Cardano has the most active github repo within the crypto space with thousands of commits per week and a very active github [as seen here](https://cardanoupdates.com/).

* Cardano is one of the very, very few crypto currencies that are actually peer-reviewed by incredibly smart cryptographers and professors around the world. Meaning, their code has to be reviewed by a 3rd party to ensure that what they are building is secure and operates how it's supposed to.

* IOHK employs some of the smartest people in cryptology and top-level engineers/professors that are well-known in the crypto world.

* Cardano's Proof of Stake (PoS) algorithm called Ouroboros is **the ONLY** provably (not probably, but *provably*) secure PoS protocol and has been proven secure through scientific research (Eth, Dash, Neo, etc. have **not** even been provably secure by any standards at all). When 
dealing with security, especially when it pertains to billions of dollars in transactions, this is a huge plus for Cardano.

* ADA has it's own main net already, meaning it's a coin, and is NOT an erc20 token (looking at you EOS, Tron, etc.).

* Cardano is implementing 2 different layers for their blockchain: Computational Layer (for smart contracts and sidechains for transactions) and Settlement Layer (used for transactions).

* Sidechains will allow multiple currencies to interact with each other within the Cardano network and allow Cardano to scale globally

* Smart contract test-nets are going live on May 28th (K-EVM) and July for the IELE VM. These will allow any Ethereum smart contract to be ported over to Cardano network and will allow smart contracts to be tested on the Cardano network. Multiple smart contracts are already lined up to switch to the Cardano network once smart contracts go live.

* Smart contracts for Cardano can be built using a multitude of programming languages such as Python, C++, C#, Javascript, etc. and even Solidity (Ethereum's smart contract language) because Cardano is using the K-Framework that will allow any programming language to work on the Cardano smart contract. Cardano's smart contract language will be Plutus.

* Scalability is beginning to be implemented in the Cardano network which will allow the network to scale as more people join the network (Similar to the bittorent protocol).

* Nano ledger integration is coming very soon (June/July).

* Paper wallets are waiting for QA and will be deployed very, very soon.

* The Daedalus wallet for ADA will be implementing staking and will allow joining stake pools through delegation. It will also allow anyone stake their ADA, since Cardano is a *TRUE* PoS system and not a dPoS (unlike EOS that only allows 21 delegates).


I'm sure I'm missing some more things, but that's just a gist of what Cardano is doing. ",1525901698

"&gt; risk of double spends (we finally established this earlier

again you fail to give me any examples of a double spend. you established nothing.  

a gas operator cares they got paid.  a LN payment can completely fail, a 0-conf will not and a double spend can be seen, a channel being emptied by another customer can not be seen/known till you try to use it

a 0-conf transaction is safe is 10 seconds and it finalizes the transaction when complete.  the gas station does not give a crap about getting paid for every gallon as it is consumed, they care about getting paid when the transaction is complete and the LN channel may even prevent that from happening to begin with requiring the customer to open yet **another** payment channel with the gas station or hoping someone else has one open with them with enough funds you can use and take away from someone else from being able to use like it was taken away from you

You don't like that I am comparing this to credit cards because 0-conf is **significantly safer** when compared to traditional banking services whereas using the LN is **significantly more troublesome/problematic for both the customer **and** the merchant that is not going to want to deal with opening payment channels for all their customers

you really do miss the point here which is **making transactions as friction-less and as safe as possible for the merchant** and LN does not do that in any way and in fact is **more** difficult than traditional banking and **more** risky to use as it may not be available when you needed it cause someone else used your channel and now a potential lost sale for the merchant due to customer dissatisfaction, or worse they loose the customer to a merchant that **does** accept simple Bitcoin (Cash) payments

"**Psychological projection**

Psychological projection is a theory in psychology in which humans defend themselves against their own unconscious impulses or qualities (both positive and negative) by denying their existence in themselves while attributing them to others. For example, a person who is habitually intolerant may constantly accuse other people of being intolerant. It incorporates blame shifting.

According to some research, the projection of one's unconscious qualities onto others is a common process in everyday life.

"&gt; I never said double spends were not possible,

huh.. I could have sworn I read something further up.....

&gt; there has never been a double spend on a merchant since Bitcoin began, that is a complete boogie man

Or maybe you define merchants to be ""those who have never been doublespent"" :p

&gt;  I am saying they are pointless to worry about and there is many other variables involved with merchant transactions that are all more of a potential problem then double spends

Just because there are other problems doesn't make double spends pointless to worry about.

&gt; and you assume a merchant has never had a fraudulent charge-backs or a stolen credit card charge-back that they are liable for that would never happen with Bitcoin

Why do you keep on talking about credit cards? We are discussing the pros/cons of 0-conf vs LN. LN doesn't have a doublespend problem, 0-conf has. A merchant has to take this into account when deciding whether 0-conf or LN is best for him.

&gt; Of course we know they are signifigantly safer than the tradition system of credit cardfs that can have a charge back months after the transactions, that alone makes Bitcoin (Cash) significantly safer

You seem to be privy to some info I don't know about. Have you actually got a number for how big a % a merchant typically gets in chargebacks vs how much that merchant looses in double spends? Till you know, you can't claim to *know* that 0-conf is better in regards to doublespend vs chargeback risk. It might be true, it might now be. I actually don't really care either, I just prefer to stick with what we can and do know.

&gt; and that is why it is nothing but a Boogie man because there is no evidence of a merchant being defrauded by a double spend after almost a decade of Bitcoin running and being used

You seem to miss the point. LN doesn't even have this problem. If I was going to operate an unmanned gasstation, as per my example, you'd have to consider the following with 0-conf

- risk of double spends (we finally established this earlier
- less than ideal service - can only fill a prepaid amount\*

Next a client requests proof of txs you are interested in and receives a proof per tx. This can be batched and cached. Most of it could be served from mem since clients are mostly interested in recent stuff. Sure some clients requests olders txs and that is more expensive. But those can be rate limited for example in order to force clients to be more effici√´nt \(always on / bg sync\)

&gt;That means, since there's 6 billion people on the planet, that there are 2160/(6*1012) = 243583606221817153033947472119380503 addresses available for every single person.

&gt;Now, if we assume there was someone who could create to the tune of 20 billion addresses per second (this would require many times more processing power than is currently used for Bitcoin mining). It'd take him on the average 2160 / (6(1012)) / (20(1012)) = 12179180311090857651697 years to find an address belonging to someone else, if everyone had an address.

&gt;The number of addresses actually in use is much smaller than this, so it would actually take even more time to find an address that has bitcoins in it.

Ethereum is a premined scam.

1\) Vitalik and many others in the Ethereum space are known scammers. Vitalik is not an idiot thus he should have known better than pitch something as ridiculous as quantum mining to potential investors. This is a snake oil salesman pitching technical nonsense to the credulous.

2\) ETH is an illegal security according to the Howey test with a premine of 72 million eths

3\) Vitalik and many other have been falsely representing Ethereum and misleading others over and over again. example \- pitching turing completeness as the valuable aspect of ETh , now pivoting away from that and saying it was never about turing completeness but ""rich statefulness""

4\) Ethereum is a pointless project that will lead to no efficiency because there is no censorship risk in code execution. If a project has no hope of ever creating an efficiency\(like bitcoin has found with regulatory arbitrage\) than every company and project will ultimately fail in its ecosystem. Are you trying to suggest that someday in the future there will be censorship risk in code execution? If not than what purpose does Ethereum solve if it comes with a horrible tradeoff of an extremely large attack surface and huge scaling problems?

5\) For goodness sake the inflation distribution rate or final algo is not even defined and people are investing in this. This is insane and basically amounts to faith in vitalik and his team, while at the same time newbs are misled into believing eth is decentralized.

Beyond that, you're clearly making me into **strawman** here by claiming that I think centralization only comes down to node count. Where in the exchange did I say that? You're just making shit up to fit your narrative.

"I day trade quite a bit with a portion of my portfolio, but I never stick to just one coin.  
The easiest trades for me occur in times like these, when bitcoin movements cause alts bounce in predictable patterns. I'll look for solid projects that took a larger dive than needed, make a prediction of where they'll end up and set my buys in increments.  
I'll give a recent example of the BTC dip two days ago. [BTC went from close to 9.7 down to 9.3 in a very short period of time](https://i.imgur.com/BeuMb81.png). This wil **always** be followed by panicselling of alts. So I sorted coins by 1hr/24hr/7d/30d changes in BTC value and work my way from left to right to narrow down my options. The 1hr chart told me everything was falling, one more than the other. The 24hr chart told me a few coins were already not having a great day to begin with. I use the 7d/30d chart to confirm these aren't coins coming off a recent surge and correcting.   
  
Was left with a few options, and [Neblio took a large hit on day that was already the 3rd red day in a row](https://i.imgur.com/HFD7mpg.png). It is also a solid project with good volume in my opinion.  
I made a judgement call and set my 50% buyin for 140006 satoshi (you will want to be just above 'nice' numbers), 25% buyin for 138606 satoshi and another 25% for 136606 satoshi. The idea is that you'll want to hit your 50% buy, but if you misjudge and it keeps dropping you take the other two along to average out lower. Put the 25 ones significantly lower than your 50 one, otherwise it makes little sense.  
[I ended up filling my first buy](https://i.imgur.com/I07ysmS.png) only and the project recovered afterwards. Decide on a nice profit percentage and take it.

"/r/Bitcoin_facts #1

[Why is the whitepaper so important?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin_Facts/comments/7dn3w4/point_1_what_is_this_obsession_with_the/)

---

People who researched Bitcoin before investing probably meant to invest in what they researched. Changing the fundamental aspects of this investment without their permission or want is unethical. 

The Bitcoin whitepaper is the specification of Bitcoin, a high level overview that should persists as relevant for all of Bitcoin's life. That's what a whitepaper is. If someone wants a system with full blocks, high fees, forced middlemen(LN), or full nodes with power, then what they want is not Bitcoin.

Let us use this simple analogy as a thought experiment to see why people feel the way they do.

*Imagine*

You read about a new steakhouse with very tasty steaks.     
You go to there, read the menu, pick out the best steak and order it.

No Imagine they bring you scrambled eggs instead. No steak. You went to the steak house, you ordered a steak, you were expecting a steak, but they brought you something else.

You complain to the waiter who tells you the cooks are experts with food and they know better than you. The cooks decided scrambled eggs would be better for you without your input or consent. 

The waiter asks why you are upset? He says he doesn't understand.         
You wanted food, they brought you food, why are you upset? The cooks are smarter than you, they know what you want better than you, you should be grateful for their input says the waiter.


This is how most Bitcoin users feel, that what they wanted (bitcoin) is not what they have (legacy bitcoin).

"Gold fluctuates, all commodities fluctuate. Lots of currencies fluctuate wildly.  Teather doesn‚Äôt fluctuate, very stable.  Depends what is too much. Gold in 40 years has done well but pegged against inflation, not so great and if you put your money into it in 2011 your still down 20% -30%. 
Bitcoin did 40 years worth of gold pricing from $70 to $1300 in just three years and even after the ‚Äòcrash‚Äô and then in one year is still 4 times higher than gold for the same investment over the shorter timeline. 

So each has to define value, too much risk, too many swings.  If you want to make a lot of money it‚Äôs not going to be in usd bonds or gold. You may beat inflation but unlikely. But to say you can invest in ‚Äòmoney‚Äô without specifying what currency is like saying crypto is all junk.

Cryptos don't produce anything so you're only hope of making money off of crypto is that the price will be higher later on... just because (mass adoption? support from big banks? the answer isn't clear). With stocks you're buying a slice of a business, and businesses provide goods and services and generate revenue.

"Regarding the 15s argument, note that the first-seen rule works as long as a miner is not involved in the attack. For instance, an attacker can easily buy 2% of the BCH hashrate in nicehash right now losing ~3% of their capital investment (steady state). Almost every block has a bunch of transactions with only 1 input spending &gt;12.5bch (see [here](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/transactions?q=input_count%281%29%2Cinput_total%281250000000..%29)), so they would have ~10mins to try to respend any coin worth their time. In this scenario, they would lose 1bch/day due to nicehash fees, but could easily make up for that with a respend in one of their 3blocks/day.

I'm not stating it'll be feasible to break a key in 10mins, I'm just arguing that the first-seen rule (and thus the 15s argument) is only valid for smaller values and as long as miners have a long-term commitment to the project. An attacker doesn't necessarily have capital invested in mining equipment and could just be looking for some short-term gains.",1525896388
"I think is clear that there is no doubt whether satoshi wanted smart transactions with a lock-time or not, for me it is clear he wanted the script to do everything it could do.

The other part I read like this: the point is that RBF is worthless for what they were discussing there if there are minimum fees filters with fee policies in the clients and non limited blocks. (Clearly, this discussion is closely related to the poisoned block attack - where a miner mines intentionally a humongous block to stall everybody else.)

The discussion there is basically how to not risk your Tx being in the limbo and a way to replace that with a proper calculated fee. Satoshi says that he wanted outputs matching, but that's just impossible (I wonder which *satoshi* wrote that one ...\*\*). In any case, what he is clearly saying is that he wants something the payee won't notice, that is, he wants that the replaced Tx is still the same Tx but only paying a higher fee, **not a second Tx as it is now**. This is an important distinction!!

To sum up: I can agree with you completely that all these issues are related, what I can't agree is with an interpretation that says satoshi wanted RBF feature like it is today and in the conditions it is used today.

In a early bitcoin era where it was basically free to spam the network, and they wanted to avoid the poisoned block attack, if miners adopted fee policies unaware users might have had Tx in the limbo, and this is bad, they needed something to get around it and recover those funds and properly send them. One solution is a RBF protocol, but that one is nothing but a policy that miners can easily not follow and does nothing against a poisoned block, the other one is simply limiting the maximum size of the blocks, what satoshi did ad hoc without consulting anyone. It breaks up the poisoned block attack and is far easier for miners to follow than sorting Tx in the pool. It is easier to increase the limit as the network grows as well.

When you combine both, that's bad, because you create a ''market'' of people making higher and higher bids to use block space and this makes the payments unreliable, you are back to one of the problems you tried to solve using one of each methods alone.

With bitcoin having much higher value now, even a meager 1sat/B makes it prohibitive for an attacker to fill up many blocks in sequence. Now, also, it is easier to sort things out in the mempool and hopefully (in BCH at least), evolve to unlimited blocks where miners set soft caps themselves.

"I read what was posted in that link. Almost all of it is about thyemos how he feels /r/bitcoin uses censorship. They are not Blockstream. Also most of what was written in those posts specifically about Blockstream was just this guys opinion and very one sided take on how things happened, none of which he provided proof of in his links.  Almost all the links he provided were about /r/bitcoin censorship and many were just other posts written by the same guy or r/btc links with more wild allegations and again no real proof.

His main beef seems to be that Blockstream employed some of the devs so that they could hijack Bitcoin. Blockstream was literally created by the already existing devs. There was no need to even create Blockstream to influence it as they were already the developers. He blames them for not allowing the block size to increase as if they somehow were doing it on purpose for some nefarious selfish reasons (again no proof). Ask any expert, blockchains are inherently inefficient. You could get better performance out of a centralized SQL database. The reason why blockchains are a big deal is because they are decentralized. That is what gives it value. Scaling using only bigger and bigger blocks removes decentralization. That is why they were against the block size increase as a crutch for scaling. 

I find it amusing that he complains about Blockstream paying devs and trying to influence Bitcoin when Bitcoin Cash was literally created by a corporation (Bitmain with ViaBTC) and is the pet project of a sleazy corporate whore millionaire in Roger Ver. Are you trying to tell me that Roger, Jihan Wu and their corporations don't have any influence over Bitcoin Cash? Bitmain pays for all of the Bcash developers. They control it! A bit hypocritical it seems.

So again, all I see is more opinion and hearsay about Blockstream. I still haven't seen any proof that Blockstream is guilty of censorship or anything else they were accused of in that link. It's just his one sided take on the whoe thing. At this point I think we should just agree to disagree because I don't see this discussion going anywhere.

Also, be fully prepared to lose any money you play with. You shouldn‚Äôt be in crypto at all with money you can‚Äôt afford to lose, so decide what is worth losing for the price of learning.

"&gt;To all future halvenings it'll get first, but if u'll compare asymptotic curves the difference is technically negligible and don't exist at all from fundamental standpoint

Just pointing out that the condition wasn't static, not assigning a positive or negative connotation to it. It will be interesting to see what affect any offset in halving epochs has.

&gt; Ability to survive hashrate loss. When BTC's hashrate will drop significantly, block production will stop for a while. It may hurt economics so significantly that BTC will never recover to past levels

The ability to survive hashrate loss is good for a minority chain, but the threat of _not surviving_ hashrate loss is arguably better for a majority chain which seeks to follow majority consensus no matter what. Any competing chain would have to break compatibility, like BCH did with EDA, to survive. That provides a degree of friction to defection from an established consensus.

&gt; I think he hadn't wrote (or maybe hadn't even thought) much about possible competition between SHA-256 chains with incompatible rulesets in the future with a community behind each chain.

He seems to have given it some thought at least. I was just re-reading a post he had written regarding merged mining on namecoin, a subset of 'SHA-256 chains with incompatible rulesets'. I'll have to take more time with that one, for sure. He also considered another subset, the special case of SHA-256 chains with incompatible rulesets forking from a majority consensus. There is evidence that he recognized at least two forms of these chains

The accidental:

&gt; We can't have subfactions of nodes that cling to one branch that they think was first, others that saw another branch first, and others that joined later and never saw what happened.

And the intentional:

&gt; Nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone. They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.

In both of those cases, the slow-to-respond original DAA encourages hash power to stay with or quickly return to alignment with the majority consensus. Whichever side finds itself to be the minority will find blocks at a slower rate, which serves both as proof of their minority position as well as an economic disincentive.

"The fundamental problem you're submitting is the lack of a delineation between the speculative value of crypto and its technological capacity. The technological value of crypto imposes an existential crisis upon banks. 

The major threat to banks is disintermediation, meaning that the crypto world is trying to facilitate Peer-to-Peer interaction. Right now, banks act as a middleman and use antiquated technology (ACH, SWIFT, FedWire etc.) that they can make a killing on by charging obscene fees. 

If banks no longer possess your money, their capital investment structure is fundamentally destroyed, within the current finance status-quo, banks/brokers make money hand over fist through fees and institutional trading. If there is an exodus from banks, it undermines the foundation of this structure.

&gt;If banks really wanted to, they have the capital to short btc to 0.

There's no way they would risk that much capital when they're already making a killing with it in the current scheme. Instead they're just going to pull regulatory strings and do everything in their power to protect themselves. 

This is why you see crypto projects like Ripple (that IMO contradict the inherent ethos of blockchain/crypto), that can be integrated into the current banking system. This allows them to benefit from the new technology by having virtually instantaneous transfer of value at extremely low cost. But who do you think is going to benefit from that?

&gt;It's a feature that's preventing moving fee-paying transactions off the blockchain, fees being a good thing that secures the blockchain as the subsidy diminishes.

Its functions should be defined and agreed before it's classified as something needing a fix, it's not a bug it's not harmed bitcoin, if anything it's been a scapegoat used to arguer fraud and that bitcoin is not broken and works for everyone, fix this and we fix fraud (NOT).

I work in a bank so I get to see all the ridiculous things people think makes their money secure. I once helped an old lady reset her debit card PIN number twice in two days because she forgot it. She also didn't know her account number. She had lost over 10 debit cards in two years. Do you think her private key will be either memorized or saved somewhere safe that she can remember? I still get people who tell me they write their PIN on the back of their debit card. If these people lose their debit card, they can just cancel it and prevent any loss to their account. If they lose their private key, theironey can be emptied in seconds and is completely unrecoverable.

"&gt; I mean from my view consensus worked perfectly. You either have overwhelming majority for a controversial change or you don‚Äôt. if there was overwhelming demand for bitcoin cash, it would be the market leader and hashrate leader.

And if there was an overwhelming majority that actually wanted Segwit, it wouldn't have been just 15% of transactions before Coinbase began making their 15% of transactions with it. Since Coinbase switched end of February, SW usage has only gone up another 3-4% and is currently only about a third of transactions.

http://segwit.party/charts/#

I wouldn't call that an ""overwhelming majority"" of support.

Therefore, less than a third of BTC users (less than a sixth if you understand properly) actually wanted to use Segwit. This would be known as a ""vocal minority.""

&gt; The small vocal minority is the big blocks crowd IMO.

So what is it, maybe 20% that wanted big blocks enough to hark fork away from Core, and 15% that actually wanted Segwit? 

Then you have maybe another 70% that would accept big blocks if it meant keeping the chain together, and maybe another 20% for the same thing for Segwit?

Then you had maybe 10% completely opposed to a blocksize increase, and around the same for Segwit.

That would leave around 5% undecided for a blocksize increase, and around 55% undecided about Segwit.

The strong opinions would be from the actual amount of users that use BCH and the amount of Segwit usage in the first few months:

https://cash.coin.dance/nodes

https://coin.dance/nodes

http://segwit.party/charts/#

The amount willing to compromise I based on the number of miners who actually signaled S2X, and the current Segwit usage.

The completely opposed numbers are a guess based on the strong opinions, and probably actually overlap, which would make the amount undecided (at the time) much higher.

I'll make a prediction here, Segwit has been out for over 8 months now, and I can say with confidence that it won't go above 40% usage before it hits the 1 year mark, August 24^th ~2AM UTC.",1525893667

"&gt;Why use blockchain which is 7x more expensive and 7x slower? 

These are great questions and I'm probably not a great one to answer them, but I have a couple thoughts. 

1) About the expensive part. When you add up the cost for all the mining gear it's probably something closer to 10,000x more expensive. However, that cost is chared by investors, so Walton (or Ven or IOTA or whoever) isn't paying for processing. For the company, the cost to process the data should be zero. 

2) About the speed part. I'm not sure about read/write speeds for blockchain data: 7x seems quite optimistic to me. I'm guessing that it's at least 100x slower than a modern, scaled, indexed DBMS. And with cloud services like AWS or Azure, it's not hard to have data replicated, backed up, and well protected. There are definite advantages to using traditional DBMSs. So what are the advantages of blockcahin? 

I think, for one, is the transparent nature of the data. Everyone gets to look at the same ledger that's validated by thousands of computers. No DBMS can make that claim. 

A second is the crowd-sourced nature of these projects. If AWS or Azure allowed people to buy some kind of token which would increase in value as their database processed more data, a lot of people would make that investment. By using this model, Blockchain services can quickly raise a ton of capital that would take much longer (and probably come with a lot more investor strings attached) raising capital the old way. 

Third: high performance doesn't always matter once you reach a certain threshold. Does it matter that a transaction writes in 800 milliseconds or 200 milliseconds? Sometimes, but sometimes &lt; 1 second is good enough, so speed is not always going to be a major factor. 

Fourth: For Bitcoin in particular, it's pretty hard to turn it off. It's pretty out of control. I don't think this is true for companies running blockchains as services, the fact that governments can't shut it down or manipulate it makes it attractive as a currency. ",1525893510

Crypto will not go away any more than personal computers or the Internet - it's really just a question of which crypto.  And for sure, there will always be more than one.",1525893494
"&gt; Segwit adds a block weight discount only for segwit transactions. Traditional one-input, two-output P2PKH transactions become relatively more expensive and you can still only fit a maximum of 1 MB of them in a block.

What's the issue here? This is partly why there's an incentive to switch. Why is this a problematic approach?

&gt;Some forms of third party malleability have been fixed with BIP-146 (https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/spec/blob/master/nov-13-hardfork-spec.md).

So in other words, no?

&gt;There's more discussion in other threads you can google, for example https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7dgh3j/malleability_and_bch/

So, in other words, still no.

Why does malleability even need fixing with BCH? I thought it was supposed to be the bare-bones original white paper design? No malleability fix was outlined in the whitepaper, so how can BCH be Bitcoin??!

No, Bitcoin is the consensus network and the blockchain for said network. Your assertion ignores this basic fact. This is what the term refers to (at least for anyone outside the BCash shill cult).

Not at all. You can't compare Bitcoin Core development team to the Linux devs. Totally different. If you think they're the same you're even more retarded than I thought. 

Just because Coke and Pepsi are sodas doesn't mean they're the same.

&gt; I wonder what would happen if you had commit privileges.

&gt; You'll find Linux repo is exactly like that. It's open to the public but not to commit anything they want. It's a centralized team that reviews and pulls in the branches and ultimately has the final say on what code is merged in. This is why there is many linux distributions focusing on different types of users from hackers to designers. You have the option to fork and create a new linux project to gather supporters. Period (as you put it).

Yeah right. That's what Gavin did actually. He wanted bigger blocks but instead of forcing everyone (since he was the lead dev and had commit privileges), he forked the code which is known today as Bitcoin XT. Meanwhile, Core deceived the miners to accept Segwit and they, stupidly enough I could say, accepted thinking that they were going to increase the block size 90 after activating Segwit. That's the difference between Core dev tricks and Gavin and Linux devs honorable attitude. Over 90% of the miners (real consensus) wanted SegWit2x. Over 51% of the miners (real consensus) wanted Bitcoin Unlimited. But Core didn't so it did not happen. So yeah, the point stands. If Core doesn't want it, even with real consensus (miners) [they will just hire shills and sock puppets like you and then buy some reddit and Twitter votes and use bots so everyone believes that their narrative is what the ""community"" wants.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7fl2np/rbitcoin_getting_spammed_by_bots_right_now_they/dqcnkf0/) Yeah because a 10k voted post on rBitcoin is totally normal while all other posts can't even get 500 upvotes unless they're bashing BCH or Roger.

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

OK

Right... I've recomposed myself. When was the last time you wired money internationally? I did it on a good few occasions in the past 2 years. Min fee was ~$30. On one occasion, as I was transferring a significant (for me) amount, the fee was a whopping $150. 

I trust you know the txs fees in Bitcoin are currently &lt;$1, regardless of amount. And when they rise again (which I hope happens sooner rather than later), you'll have LN payments available. The tx fees for LN are not even worth discussing.

&gt;-Credit cards/banks already offer no fee for foreign transactions under de minimus amounts, it will always be cheaper and faster.

You must be one of those who never travels. First comment, credit card transactions are never free... you don't see the tx cost because it's hidden in the price of the goods - Merchants have to cover the ~2-5% fee for every txs.

Second, when you travel abroad, unless you have a credit card specifically designed for travel, you will ALWAYS pay a txs fee. My cc will always add $2-$3 as ""foreign fee"".

&gt;There is still an argument to be made for the contracting company in Nigeria that needs to buy a tractor from john deere in the US but can't save because their currency is hyper-inflationary and they have no access to financial infrastructure. With that being said it's an incredibly small use case and becomes useless when the underlying medium of exchange is so volatile, even in a positive direction.

There's much more than just Nigeria... there's tons of people in Africa who would LOVE to transact in USD, but cannot because there's no banking system. Guess what? They are increasingly using Bitcoin.

"&gt; What, in your opinion, makes BCH a scam? 

It could be a legit project and may eventually turn into a legit project but as it stands right now is a scam because it was created under a false narrative , for more reasons than accurately promoted , and its biggest oracles and promoters often use lies and deception to promote it. 

If many of the top oracles in Bitcoin promoted BTC dishonestly one could also make a case that Bitcoin is a scam project as well. 

&gt; Lastly, what do you think would be the main cause of centralisation  which would occur if BTC were to raise the blocksize cap to 32MB  tomorrow? 

These are the main issues with a blocksize increase \(notice I supported the previous block weight increase with segwit and support future HF blocksize increases as was the plan all along\)

Hard drive capacity is the least of our concerns due to ‚Äì

Archival full nodes contain the full blockchain and allow new nodes to bootstrap from them . Current blockchain size is \~170\+GB for an archival node

Pruned nodes can get down to around **\~5GB ,** and **have all the same security and privacy benefits of archival nodes** but need to initially download the whole blockchain for full validation before deleting it \(It actually prunes as it validates\)

The primary resource concerns in order largest to smallest are:

1\) Block propagation latency \(causing centralization of mining\)

2\) UTXO bloat \(increases CPU and more RAM costs\)

3\) Bandwidth costs [https://iancoleman.github.io/blocksize/#\_](https://iancoleman.github.io/blocksize/#_)

4\) IBD \(Initial Block Download \) Boostrapping new node costs 

5\) Blockchain storage \(largely mitigated by pruning but some full archival nodes still need to exist in a decentralized manner\)

This means we need to scale conservatively and intelligently. We must scale with every means necessary. Onchain, decentralized payment channels , offchain private channels , optimizations like MAST and schnorr sig aggregation, and possibly sidechains/drivechains must be used. ",1525891446

But the problem is more for customers paying with BTC or other crypto.

As an intermediary PayPal provides that protection to customers, so they can buy online with confidence.

I wonder what would happen if you had commit privileges.

I have no comment.

Satoshi could always leave a message if he felt strongly about it. Just because my wife leaves me in charge of my kids doesn't mean I'm the best person for the job, I hire clowns to help me out.

&gt;  At the moment only Core has commit privileges which means that if they don't want to implement a change then it won't happen. Period. Linux repo is not like this.

You'll find Linux repo is exactly like that. It's open to the public but not to commit anything they want. It's a centralized team that reviews and pulls in the branches and ultimately has the final say on what code is merged in. This is why there is many linux distributions focusing on different types of users from hackers to designers. You have the option to fork and create a new linux project to gather supporters. **Period** (as you put it).

I would review business plans and new tech and company after company.  Market, competitive analysis.  Ethereum white paper shat on every single new tech (other than CRISPR) I've seen in the past 20 years.  The prospective core ecosystem of ETH, KYB, REQ, MKR, DAI, OMG etc is incredible and is developing so quickly.  Many of the cryptos in development will annihilate existing monolithic infrastructure businesses.  

I also have what could be considered an ethical motivation-  while people have and will get rich from crypto, there is much promise that many of the technologies can actually improve and enhance our lives at the individual, societal level.  Not in some duplicitous facebook way but by removing power from corporations and governments that profit off human suffering.  The original spirit of Bitcoin is important- elegant, attractive, and paradigm changing.

"&gt; But I guess regular on-chain txs are just as bad?

On-chain transactions are not private, but can be more anonymous. It is a lot of work -hard work- to execute with the type of operational security necessary to stymie a global adversary. Most people are not equipped to pull it off, but in all honesty, it's not a realistic threat for most people, either. History shows that the tide can turn quickly and it would be fantastic if we could provide turnkey solutions to tyranny - but we're not there, yet.

Bitcoin is a tool that, when used right, can provide an amazing amount of anonymization and obfuscation, but it isn't a one-size-fits-all fix against the powers that be. A problem with great opsec is that you have to be applying it _before you need it_. Once you realize you're at risk, it is too late to undo what's already done.

Remember the Linden Dollar&lt;-&gt;Bitcoin exchange?,1525888244
"&gt;But the fact that it hasn't, you just proved my point.

Not at all... Bitcoin is essentially nuclear\-grade software. It's going to be really slow to make any changes. Ethereum's whole mantra is 'move fast and break things.'

\&gt;  I will agree that bitcoin is probably the most well supported and secure chains there is and will be for a good long while. \*\*But, no. It simply cannot ''easily do what Ethereum is doing'' and to state this vastly overstates your understanding of this space... \*\*

Comments like this are what I meant when I said that most investors seem to not understand what they're investing in. You could literally hardfork the Bitcoin blockchain onto the Ethereum software, if there was consensus. Do you know what Ethereum is? It's just a Bitcoin fork, with a scripting language added and some algorithm tweaks. That 'virtual machine' capability was \*proposed and rejected for Bitcoin.\* The only reason it was done as a separate project is because people didn't want to be experimenting on the main Bitcoin chain.

Have you heard of Rootstock? It's a dapp platform built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain \- except no hard fork required, and it won't clog the main chain with smart contract transactions. Nivaura? Already settled a real security, from start to finish, on the Bitcoin blockchain. You just don't hear about these companies because they didn't do an ICO, but many of them are a lot further along than anything on an altcoin network.

Like I said, I hold a ton of Ethereum, and some other coins. I'm not a maximalist. But new investors don't understand that most of the ""new"" tech isn't really new at all. Proof of Stake predates Bitcoin. DAG doesn't really work yet, and seems to give up decentralization anyway.",1525888220
Thats all just FUD. BCN is the real bitcoin.,1525888213
"More than any other aspect of 'digital cash' Dash addresses one problem over all others that is a core requirement. That is to decouple the trade clearing priority from the block mining process.

\(By ""trade clearing"" I mean the action by which a merchant processes a customer trade, be it online on a website or at a POS terminal\).

Dash can do this because its network supports a realtime service protocol in parallel with the traditional POW block\-time protocol. The need for the transaction to work in realtime and the mining confirmations to work in blocktime can therefore be met without encountering conflicting priorities as is the case with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or most other networks that do not support a realtime protocol layer where the nodes can confer with each other.

Although you can do ""instant"" transactions with Bitcoin Cash, they are not ""instant"" in a real sense. They still work in blocktime \- just with zero confirmations. Additionally there's no auxiliary network support for fungibility maintenance. It's all organic the same as with bitcoin.

With ""real"" cash, the shopkeeper takes the till to the bank at the close of trading each day and the takings are ""mixed"" with those of all other shopkeepers, thereby maintaining the fungibility and untraceability of the coins. The Dash masternode network \(again by way of its realtime ""service protocol""\) supports a perfect digital analogue of this important attribute of cash.

Finally, the question of ""scaling"" is not simply one of database/network capacity. Monetary scaling is a slightly more sophisticated concept that involves growth into derivative layers, ubiquity and ease of propagation into all kinds of consumer applications that require an ""active"" response from the cryptocurrency network as opposed to simply being served up the latest version of the blockchain. What Evolution will do is evolve Dash's service protocol \- managed by the masternodes \- so that it actually provides the same functions that modern credit card processors like Stripe do. Plugins for websites, backend security for ""light"" JSON clients, wallet functions and so on.

So there will be a ""client side"" developer community for Dash in addition to that of the network itself and this is how it will scale both technologically and monetarily.",1525888159

2) Secure your account info by not losing your checks, account number or debit card. If you have lost any of these or they are compromised by hackers, inform your bank and they will give you all that money back

3) Don't send wires to people you don't know, otherwise your money may be unrecoverable (just like Bitcoin)

As for Telegram, I may be in the minority, but I think it's a horrible platform.  Instant chat type messengers are great for one on one communication, or perhaps a small group, but these Telegram channels that have ten thousand people, dozens of which are posting at any given time, just don't add any value.  It's impossible to follow a conversation.  I subscribe to a few for official updates from teams, but they certainly aren't a source of information or help and they do get crazy unwieldy to moderate. If you have a good Reddit and Facebook presence, that is where the average user will gain the most.  I certainly wouldn't spend good money just to buy a team that will facilitate Telegram.

"U/suuperdad has the right idea.

We need to manage risk. Put 60% of your money in low risk (buy a house and wait 10-20 years) 30% in medium risk (buy stocks and wait 5-10 years) and 10% in high risk like crypto.
We believe in the tech but the tech is not the coins. We could lose everything on BTC,ETH, etc... and the institutional investors can still make billions off the companies behind the coins and the hardware manufactures stock (Nvidia,etc...).
Investing in the tech is not really open to ‚Äúcivilians‚Äù the VC‚Äôs will have it all locked up.

My outlook is really just 4 points:
1: Crypto is ultra-volatile don‚Äôt invest anything you are not prepared to loose.
2: Spread the risk across multiple coins and multiple platforms/exchanges (MT GOX can and will happen again)
3: Be PATIENT whether it is crypto, stocks or real-estate tracking daily will drive you mad. Pick a horse and dive in for the medium to long term (stock day traders don‚Äôt really out perform the market over the medium term)  
4: Crypto is like horse racing. You can analyse the previous races, look into the performance of the parents, track all of the trainers and jockeys history but in the end you make your best bet and then HDOL on until the end of the race.

If it was easy we would all be driving lambos. 
Good luck boys and girls!

PS: just to be controversial: don‚Äôt dismiss everything Warren Buffet says. I hope (and think) he is wrong on crypto but the man knows the game and his base concept of investing in a product with good fundamentals for the long term is 100% spot-on.

I didn't say anything about BCH, and neither did this graphic. You're the shill in this particular discussion. 

Raising the block size limit is something the core team is not fundamentally against, it's just something they didn't want to do yet. Lightning is a better solution for payments because it has no reliance on block creation times. Most people agree that we don't need every single retail purchase to be recorded on the blockchain for eternity. So raising the block size limit only pushes the problem down the road. BCH is banking on the core team working out all the issues with lightning for them, and I assume they will integrate lightning sometime soon after BTC has it in full swing. 

As for me though, I still have most of my airdropped BCH. But I won't support BCH, because it's more centralized, because Ver supports it, and because they are using sleazy tactics(bitcoin.com and @bitcoin twitter misinformation) to try to make it seem legitimate. ",1525886821

Also, the fixed 2% rule also allows you to fail 50 times in a row before you get totally blown out of your account. Trust me, I've blown my account a couple times in the past month and a half and it sucks, but a fixed 2% has prevented that for me in the past couple months. ",1525885310

Bitcoin receives regular updates. It could easily do what Ethereum is doing, or almost any other crypto, but those changes weren‚Äôt made to bitcoin for very valid reasons. That doesn‚Äôt mean that they couldn‚Äôt be added in some form, some day. ",1525884898

"*Most of the so called experts and 'winners' simply got into crypto early. They mean nothing to me. My crypto crew are folks like yourself who have a more realistic and tough experience.*

I think I see what you're saying, but those long-term holders went through MUCH bigger crashes than those of us who got in in 2017. And when they did, no one was talking about Bitcoin. It wasn't in the news. They didn't get to read articles about adoption every day like we do.

"I can tell you what the big obstacle is. It's not token management, or issuance complications, or distrust in smart contracts.

It's licensing.

Game platforms are *incredibly* strict about transactions. XBox Live, for example, requires that any in-game transactions be conducted via their Game Store. Unity has a crystal-clear ""no gambling"" clause in its license agreement. Google Play apps are not allowed to accept payment via any method other than the Play Store; same with iTunes.

Integrating blockchain technology in any form potentially runs afoul of these licensing restrictions for game developers. There was a company called Mego (I think they're still around) that was trying to make a Minecraft server that used a real-money economy denominated and recorded entirely in Bitcoin. Mojang brought that to a halt, and they pivoted to a pay-for-vanity model like other complying servers.

Even a non-monetary blockchain token integrated into a game could bring legal problems. Just *enabling* this type of trade opens a very difficult can of worms for game producers.",1525884801

Buffett is about investment, not venture capitalism.  And this is as venture capitalist as it gets.
     
If you ever read ""The Intelligent Invester"" (written by Benjamin Graham and Buffets mentor), you would know it goes against the incredibly sound INVESTMENT practices preached and utilized by Buffett.  This is new tech and new territory of eco-socionimic frontiers that carries obscene levels of risk.  You are doing this because you either believe in the tech, or believe you are just hoping and praying for a good return.

"Yes, but its very difficult mentally to just leave it in after it went up 100x .  

Like people who bought BTC at $0.50.  When that hit $1000 before the mt gox crash.. Say the person who bought in spent $500 bucks(what he could mentally afford to lose) That's a million dollars.  To keep that million in for 3 years after it crashed 50%.  That's got to be one do the hardest things to just keep in considering the owner of those isn't,already rich.   To just say ""fuck it...I don't care if I lose that 500 grand gain, I'm gonna let it sit there for 3 more years until its like 10 million. ""

That takes a lot of balls. Mentally. I know if I hit a million dollars I'm not going to let it sit there I'm going to take out at least 90% .  That's because I know that 90% will change my life. I will just buy a house paid in full. And buy a property in full, and,just live off the rent collected to give me my basic needs. Food, gas., taxes etc.     

Shit I can rent out both properties and just take a lifelong vacation with the rent money that I'm collecting every month.     Who said a million dollars is enough to retire?

"A lot of people can't do some of this stuff (for example, buying a house after 6 years living in a van)... but everyone (EVERY SINGLE PERSON) can do a lot of this stuff.

Even if you live in an apartment building in the middle of the city, you have a window sill somewhere that you can put a $1 raspberry plant on (which you smartly purchase off an end of sale auction at a nursery). That $1 will turn into $20-50 of food in a year. Not only that, but it will ""sucker"" (new growth) that you can divide and re-pot, and grow a free plant.

Incase you didn't notice, this is LITERALLY PRINTING MONEY.

Raspberries are damn near impossible to kill. 

If anyone reading this has a lawn, even a postage stamp cookie cutter lawn, you have the ability to grow at least $1000 of food on your lawn, with just a few trees. You can buy these trees for $3-5 each if you look for 1 year old bare-root trees online. Sure it may take 5 years to produce fruit, but every single $5 you spend will be literally thousands of dollars of food in the lifetime of the tree. 

If you live in colder climate think about maybe planting some evertreens, douglas fir, etc. You can plant those for $1-3 and sell it in 4 years for $20-80, and they will be zero maintenance if you wood chip mulch them (which you can get for free from city/arborists). 

Everyone reading this can cut back their data plan, their internet speed. Everyone can cut back on entertainment they buy. Everyone can eat out less. Everyone can buy food on sale. Everyone can coupon clip. Many people can car pool. Everyone can try gig economy (UBER etc).

So so so many ways for everyone to save money, and fund crypto in a way that makes it super easy to hold forever - because you worked hard and saved money that you would have lost forever anyways.",1525884123

"That is all valid, except it kind of did have a field test on Litecoin. 
BCH had to hard fork again because it's difficulty adjustment algorithm was fucked by making miners mine the shit out of it at low difficulty, then abandon it, making it flip flop in difficulty. Then it forked again and added Colored Coins, which is new again. People don't realize that Bitcoin Clashic is the ""satoshi's"" Bitcoin cash, but the new Bitcoin cash isn't. 
Bitcoin isn't experimental, it's live and has been for a while. Of course, you can still use BTC clients from before BCH or Segwit existed, and it still works fine. 
For example, just because browsers support html5 doesn't mean the intenret now is a different network than 7 years ago.

"Yeah, but might makes right and therefore you should fall in line and go along with whatever is in the perceived best interests of miners because ""that's how Bitcoin's consensus system works."" This is decentralization, folks. 

Seriously, it is really hard to understand the more general philosophical perspective of people here. I'm sympathetic to a (small) block size increase, but it seems that people here think that validating the chain is useless and we all just ought to trust a handful of powerful miners to not only decide the rules (this is how Bitcoin works, of course) but also that the rules they choose are automatically good. It will be very interesting when governments really start getting involved in this game. An extreme willingness to hard fork changes will make it very easy for powerful entities to use social (or even technical/mining) manipulations to change the rules in their favor.

The devs may have *some* power in that they are the ones who write the code, but anyone can learn to write code, and the devs can't force anyone to run a given piece of software. As you mention here, devs with different ideas wrote software with different rules, some people chose to run that software, UTXO splits happen, and boom: permissionless money. 

The same just isn't true for the miners, who ought not be looked at as *people* with the Bitcoin network's best interest at heart, but rather as profit-seeking automatons. There is nothing wrong with this or reason to be judgmental about it, but we must always keep in mind that miners are integral to the protocol and assumed to be untrusted, by definition.

"Here's my take...

I split my overall portfolio like this:

- 60% in Slow long term growth

- 30% in medium risk

- 10% in high risk high reward.

That 10% used to be various longshot tech stocks (robotics, MEMS, CRISPRS, Quantum Dot tech, etc).... all I did was move that all into crypto (and bumped it up to about 15%).

That 10-15% I consider lost the moment I spent it.

I then take that 10-15% and I split **IT** up in the same way... 60% of it in low risk, 30% in medium risk, 10% in high risk. So I have 60% in ETH/BTC, 30% in stuff like NEO, VEN, OMG, and 10% in stuff like TKY, ENG, REQ, AMB.

Now, how did I fund my 10-15% speculative portfolio so that I'm okay with ""not caring"" if I lose it all? I fund it with money that I would have lost regardless. 

For example, my wife and I used to grab coffees once a day, maybe 2-3 times a day on weekends (kids hockey, etc). Now, we pack our own thermos and I take the delta and pocket it in a jar. 

I made a massive cold storage room at home, which I use to store food. Now, if onions are on sale, I'll buy 3 bags at once, track the delta that I saved, put that in a jar. If I spoil some onions because I ""messed up and bought too much"" I'll take that out of the jar. If rice or beans go on sale, same thing, buy a bunch of it and save money.

I used to buy a video game a month, every month that goes by that I don't buy a game, I put that in the jar. 

I cut my cell phone data plan for a month, all money I saved I put in the jar. I cut my internet speed, same thing. This is all money that used to be ""getting erased immediately"", and is now being put in a jar.

If my friends want to go to a bar, or a movie, and I suggest coming over and watching the hockey game instead, I'll take $20 and stick it in the jar (or 50 if it was the bar).

I spent $10 last year on raspberry bushes (for example), and raspberries are about $4 for a small container at Walmart. Every time I fill a container that size with fresh raspberries, I take $4 and stick it in the jar (once the $10 was paid off first). I actually took a bunch of profits from that and rolled it into apple trees, peach trees, pear trees. I'm ""paying those off"" with the jar money, but once I break even, then imagine how much I can put in every week just off free food growing off trees that used to be just bare grass lawn. I even got a few pears last year, on the first year (that tree was a bit bigger/older than the others).

When I say ""put it in a jar"", it's actually an excel sheet, but same difference.

End of the week, I'll take that money, count it up, and that's my budget for next week's crypto buys. I'll then try to time those buys in good pullbacks/dips.

That money was all 100% gone before. Now it's crypto.

When crypto dips, I don't give a shit, because I never had that money in the first place. It used to be spent on ""slightly faster internet"". It's now invested in my (and my kids) future. 

It makes it really easy to not sell, because I'm going it in a very controllable way. It's money that I don't even miss, because it was being spent on stupid things.",1525882139

"The Bitcoin based blockchains track the unspent outputs (UTXO = unspent transaction output)

In terms of fiat....  I you have a $20 in your pocket and buy a $3 coffee.  You hand them the $20 and they give you change ($10, $5, 2 $1) and your coffee.  The $3 stays in their cash drawer.

When you go to the next store and buy a $6 item, you have them either the $10 (and get 4 $1 in change) or give them a $5 and one of the $1 bills.

The blockchain only cares about what you have and can spend.  Under the covers, a transaction uses inputs (the $20 bill) and creates outputs (new UTXO's) that can be spent.

In the example with cash, you have $10 sent to you, $5 and 2 $1 transaction outputs.  Those are all recorded as UTXO's that can be spent by your address.

His article discusses a more efficient way of tracking those UTXO's over the current LevelDB database.

Every node scans the entire blockchain (even if it does not keep history - pruning) just to build a trusted UTXO database.  He proposes ways that it can have checkpoints so if your database gets corrupted, you can just roll back to the last good point, and move forward.  Today, the entire blockchain has to be rescanned from the beginning just to find the current UTXOs.

It would be a faster and safer method.  Others can comment on the technical details.

 - Small blocks and BCASH BCASH
 - ""Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin"", Bitcoin (BCH)

It was always curious how Bitmain was complaining about how Bitcoin needed a capacity increase, yet would consistently mine empty or small blocks. 

If the folks here were consistent with their big block/fast tx philosophy, they would be virulently against covert asicboost, which reduces capacity and makes it take longer for transactions to get confirmed.

&gt;You dont have to agree, but when you say that its crap that Satoshi did't have a vision you have to understand that there are hundreds of thousands of people who disagree. 

I never said Satoshi didn't have a vision. I said that Bitcoin doesn't have ""intent"" and that BCH is not ""Satoshi's vision"" (and that this is a wholly unverifiable statement anyway).

No. In fact he acknowledges that the protocol has issues which if you follow the developers mailing list they are actively working on improvements every day even since he made the quote 6 months ago there have improvements.

Ok, how did they improve on the need to broadcast everything to all channels?

Because this is the major bottlenecks!

(Genuinely interested, it is not the first time I adk and nobody seem to be able to reply)

So far all the solutions proposed relied on some level of trust (masternode).

&gt;&amp;gt;I am waiting for a link to support your claim.

&gt;Correct you are refusing to take the deal and do the research on why the scaling plan for ethereum is focused on layer 2. You want me to do the research for you which isn't the deal I offered.

ETH didn‚Äôt gave up on onchain scaling.



&gt;&amp;gt; but I guess you refuse to understand. 

&gt;You haven't said anything but repeated over and over again you have to trust your peers to route your tx....which is the same thing as BCH, BTC and every other peer/routed network. Please quote where you explained the difference. 

No, again you don‚Äôt get it.

If your own channels get the full network topology and find a route itself then it is trustless obviously (you didn‚Äôt rely on someone else).

&gt;EDIT: side note, that blog spam article you posted with the quote....completely ridiculous...no context of the quote at all and then terribly written gibberish.

Here is rusty quote:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/714x2k/what_is_the_status_of_the_lightning_network/dn8v3dg/

&gt;&amp;gt; On first connect, nodes either dump the entire topology or send nothing. That‚Äôs going to suck even faster; ‚Äúcatchup‚Äù sync planned for 1.1 spec.

&gt;This barely qualifies as english and is technically nonsense and obviously competely innacurate. Is THIS where you get your info from? 

Rusty Russell is a blockstream LN dev


&gt;&amp;gt;As for implementation, c-lightning at least is hitting the database more than it needs to, and doing dumb stuff like generating the transaction for signing multiple times and keeping an unindexed list of current HTLCs, etc. And that‚Äôs just off the top of my head.‚Äù

"1. of all BAX is an utility token and not a currency. The token can be used to send BAX from your BABB account to any other wallet (this can be exchanges or individuals) and is also used to fuel the network (pay fees in the network).

2. Your BABB account will provide BAX/fiat pairings so you can choose yourself if you want to hold BAX, fiat or both on your account.

3. Since BABB aims to get a banking license your funds will be guaranteed (to a certain amount) by the respective central bank (the same like your traditional bank account).

4. BABB seamlessly connects the crypto to the traditional banking world. As your account is also a wallet in the same time you can for example speed up fiat cash out and don‚Äòt need to go through exchanges and wait a couple of days until you receive your fiat funds. I‚Äòll make an example. You wan‚Äòt to cash out the gains you made with xyz coin on Binance, you simply sell the tokens for BAX, send the BAX to your BABB account and there you‚Äôll be able to instantly convert your BAX to one of the supported fiat currencies.

You are then free if you wan‚Äòt to send the funds to another bank account or keeping them there (fiat transfers to other banks will occur through the traditional interbanking systems).

Carfentanil or carfentanyl is an analog of the synthetic opioid analgesic fentanyl. A unit of carfentanil is 100 times as potent as the same amount of fentanyl, 5,000 times as potent as a unit of heroin and 10,000 times as potent as a unit of morphine.

The toxicity of carfentanil in humans and its ready commercial availability has aroused concerns over its potential use as a weapon of mass destruction by rogue nations and terrorist groups.

Carfentanil was first synthesized in 1974 by a team of chemists at Janssen Pharmaceutica which included Paul Janssen.

**Fentanyl**

Fentanyl, also spelled fentanil, is an opioid which is used as a pain medication and together with other medications for anesthesia. It has a rapid onset and effects generally last less than an hour or two. Fentanyl is available in a number of forms including by injection, as a skin patch, and to be absorbed through the tissues inside the mouth.

Common side effects include nausea, constipation, sleepiness, and confusion.

If you want to learn about the crypto market, whenever they make a altcoin buy, do a little research, then use 1\-5&amp;#37; of your stake to buy some.

Then make your life simple.  Once you buy, put a sell order at the same time for half the order at 2x the price.  This gets your initial investment back to reinvest.

So if I bought 100 ABC at 0.01, i immediately put a sell order for 50 ABC at 0.02

It is hard.

Doing it trustlessly in a adversarial environment is extremely hard. (And remain scalable might be impossible)

Peers that don't perform or do malicious actions are banned. THis is the same in bitcoin and every other routed network on the planet.

If your channel have the complete topology and find a route itself, it is trustless.

If your channel don‚Äôt have to full network topology and have to rely on someone else to provide a route, it is not trustless.

Nothing really completed here.

"A new transaction on a channel requires *both* parties to sign new Bitcoin transactions. If one party has decided to close the channel, he is not going allow any more transactions to happen on that channel.

You can't claim everything for yourself because at each state of the channel, you have a transaction signed by the other party which will pay them their part of the funds, and either pay you the remaining funds after 144 blocks, or pay the other party immediately if he has a secret key for that previous state (which he will have, if there is a newer state).

However, the other party has a transaction signed by you, which will pay your part of the funds, and the remaining funds will either pay him after 144 blocks, or will pay you immediately if you have his secret key for that state (which again, you will have if there is a newer state).

If either of you sign one of these old transactions which the other party has the secret key for, that party can sign a competing transaction using the same signature, but which will claim the funds immediately, and because the person who signed the first transaction has to wait 144 blocks, their transaction will fail as an attempt to double spend what has already been spent.

Which makes it *never* desirable to broadcast an old state because you will lose all of the funds in the channel, unless you fail to broadcast the competing transaction (which is what the watchtower is for, to ensure that it discovers the old transaction and broadcasts the competing one if it does)..",1525875527

"Most negative comments here are laughable at best. The people expecting full decentralisation of a Chinese cryptocurrency, have no idea how the world works. Since when did China ever allow a full decentralised platform? I doubt anyone fudding about this has a legitimate reason to do so, besides a hidden agenda. They never invested.

Also let me give ya'll some advice concerning VeChain's so called FUD, with a well placed Warren Buffett quote, which seems to be a trend nowadays ;) 

""The secret to becoming wealthy? Be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy"". 

Just go and do some research into VeChainThor, double-check the credibility of all their statements by validating every source and look into the people and partners involved. Eventually you'll start to see and know why it's smart not to believe in all the negative BS posted on reddit or anywhere else for that matter. There aren't many genuine crypto projects around like VeChain. Perhaps only a handful.

The FUD (while weak) is present on reddit because on paper Vechain is a beast in the making and a possible problem for the current top 5 and of all the other crypto projects targeting similar markets. The big and small communities are trying to safeguard their own bags by fudding VEN. The amount of times I've seen Vechain mentioned in different community channels is very VERY high. Only Bitcoin and Ethereum are mentioned more often.

And finally... Full decentralisation is impossible. It's a utopia that just does not exist. There will ALWAYS be a government involved in some form or shape. If not now then later when regulations kick in. And there will be plenty.

VeChain and a few other crypto projects are preparing themselves for actual mass/enterprise adoption and government support, instead of following a dream of having a currency and platform that's from the people for the people. We past that point of no return a few thousand years ago already. When we stopped exchanging goods with eachother and started using coins. 

When it comes down to decentralisation. Let's focus on decentralizing clouds, getting rid of the middle men in different business scenarios and value transactions and let's have most of our data stored in a decentralised manner. Those are our current target areas and blockchain companies like VeChain bring out the technology to make that happen.

"TL;DR you can't solve every problem by sprinkling some ""blockcjhian"" on it. Much like in 2000, you could not solve every problem by putting it on the Internet (like IoT is trying to do now).

Where we diverge from TFA: Bitcoin solved a problem. CAP (database) theory said you had to pick 2 attributes in a distributed database:

* Consistency
* Availability
* Partition Tolerance

Bitcoin used the concept of Proof-of-work to allow the network to regain consistency after a partition. In that way, Bitcoin is Consistent and Available, in the absence of a Partition. During a Partition, Bitcoin is Available, but not Consistent.

So thanks to Bitcoin, a distributed, append-only database (with strong time-stamping if the blocks are not full) now exists.

The point of TFA is that the existence of such a database does not imply that all the data stored in it is properly validated. Bitcoin (Cash) is designed to be a currency first. Random non-financial data added to the blockchain is not validated by the network.",1525875216
"Think alot of the reasoning for alts going up or down in relation to BTC/ETH comes from the fact that they are the leading pairs options.

Also you have those who are moving Alts gains into BTC/ETH and the same for BTC/ETH to alts.

Nothing in Bitcoin is certain, even the entire system as encryption can be broken at any time with significantly faster computers (quantum computers).

Of course we know they are signifigantly safer than the tradition system of credit cardfs that can have a charge back **months** after the transactions, that alone makes Bitcoin (Cash) significantly safer

ok

Then how your channel find route?

&gt;This is simply not true at all. Try it yourself. You'll see what happens, sending a tx doesn't even consider liquidity of the route. The payment succeeds or it fails. Period. If it fails a new route is tried. It succeeds or it fails. Period. 

You still need a map to find a route, how you get that without asking all other channels?

&gt;&amp;gt; Because you trust another hub/channel/serves to route you Payment.

&gt;No......stop lying dude, they either route it or they don't. If they stop routing payments you find another peer with better uptime. End of story.

&gt; I've seen the fud about LN peddled here for years. you just repeat the same old bullshit.

That's a good one! Like when LN [was supposed to be ready in 6 months... that was 2015](https://twitter.com/starkness/status/676599570898419712) you mean? And now it's not even a pre-alpha toy implementation with no adoption and no economic incentives whatsoever.

&gt; whatever link i send you to - you will claim it doesn't show...

Another funny one. Ok, so you don't have anything to show and you blame me for that, and even speak for me in the future.

&gt; are smart contracts ""unnecessary contraption""?

Of course not. LN is the unnecessary contraption for making payments. We love smart contracts, and we will have them Bitcoin Cash soon, don't worry. But they are not needed to make simple payments.

&gt; why do you believe this? what is your proof of that?

Precisely because there is no proof to the extraordinary claims that LN could work as a scaling solution. And extraordinary claims needs extraordinary proofs.

I wont do your work. It's the LN proponents who needs to proof in the real world that it can work. I expose my reasons why I think it wont, I don't need you to believe me, in order to work in what I find worth my time.

And this long conversation is no longer worth my time. I had already tagged you as a troll a while ago [for this comment you made](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7o3qb9/bitcoin_cash_and_bitcoin_core_compared_just_the/ds6ks8f/). But I was curious to see the best arguments you could provide. So far not impressed. And I still think you are troll. Although a better than average one I reckon, but that's not much to say.

"I don't see how it's taxation. The miners didn't literally dig gold out of the ground, only for it to be confiscated and redistributed, that's a silly analogy.

As with Bitcoin, it's simple inflation - all holders of the currency have their share diluted in order to pay miners for their work. In Dash, all holders have their share diluted in order to pay miners, masternodes, developers and third party projects that were approved for funding. 

Why is it fair or desirable that miners should be the only party to benefit from inflation, when so many other elements in the network are performing work and incurring real costs?",1525873494

This was the same time people were complaining about withdraws being down for days.  A week later, the withdraws were locked and stories about the owner stealing came to light.

"What‚Äôs wrong with investing in Coca Cola?

It‚Äôs making his money work for him, betting on a relatively sure outcome, with reasonable long term expectations. And that‚Äôs quite frankly the opposite of what crypto investments are today. 

However much you and I love crypto, none of us have a clue about what‚Äôs going to happen. Bitcoin could become absolutely massive, but it could also become the Netscape of Crypto. All of the Cryptos we know today could be worthless in 5 years. They could also be worth a small fortune. 

What I can tell you for sure is that no one here will be netting a stable and predictable 6-10% return per annum. It will either be 1000-5000% at some point or it will be a big fat 100% loss. And that‚Äôs probably fine for the most of us who have invested money we can afford to lose. 

But Warren and the likes, are not playing the same game we are. The stakes are much much higher, and therefore it must be something tangible... Like Coca Cola. 

Look at it this way... He bought Coca Cola stocks for $1 billion in the 80‚Äôs (roughly $2.2 billion in today‚Äôs money). Last year it netted around $500 million in dividends, and the stock holdings are worth around $16 billion. Even if you adjust for inflation that‚Äôs 25% return per annum in dividends, while still keeping your holdings, which are also growing in value. Not bad for flogging sugar water. 

Bitcoin at this point certainly can‚Äôt give you anything like that. You can gamble on it mooning, but then you would have to sell it or spend it to realise your profit. Bitcoin doesn‚Äôt do dividends. 

Unless you get together with other people who have sizeable BTC holdings and start lending it out for a return... in which case you have just created a bank. 

Say what you want about Gates and Buffet, but they do have a point that should be considered. Dismissing them as stupid or ‚Äúscared‚Äù is ignorant as hell. If they were threatened by Crypto, they would keep their mouth shut and just quietly stock up on it and emerge as Crypto overlords in a few years time. 

Between those two, they know far more about world finance and the application of  technology than all of us here combined.

I thought it would be so cool to have this same system but with crypto.  I also had the idea of in-game tournaments with real money pots that are funded by micro transactions of all players participating, all run completely within the game.

"Please know all this about lightning before getting too excited 

Essentially, lightning only works as a scaling solution when everyone is already using it. It has no way to bridge the gap from no users(where it is starting) to everyone worldwide using it.

If the node you are trying to pay is offline, you simply can't pay. And you still incur fees when you settle your channels on the restricted blocksize chain.

Worse, it has numerous tradeoffs that will discourage the average person from using it. This amplifies the downsides that arise from it not being universally in use instantly, and will prevent it from ever reaching that state. Here are those:

1. You must be online all the time to be paid. And the person you want to pay must be online for you to pay them.

2. If you go offline at the wrong time and aren't using a centralized hub, you can lose money you didn't even knowingly transact with.

3. The solution to #2 is to enlist ""watchers"" to prevent you from losing money. More overhead the average person isn't going to care about or understand, and more fees that have to be paid. Or people will just be forced to use centralized hubs.

4. Two new users to Lightning will not be able to actually pay eachother without using a centralized hub because no one will lock up funds into the opposing side of their channels; No funded channels = can't pay eachother. Hence... Hubs.

5. Using hubs will come with monthly fee; They aren't going to lock up their capital on your behalf for no cost.

6. The entire system is vulnerable to a mass-default attack. Hubs are especially vulnerable.

7. Lightning will not be able to route large payments(no route available).

8. Lightning transactions are larger than normal transactions.

9. Lightning nodes must keep track of the full history of channel states themselves. If they lose this, they are vulnerable to attacks and may lose coins.

10. Attackers may randomly lock up funds anywhere along the chain of channels for extended periods of time(many hours) at no cost to themselves.

11. The network randomly may fail to work for a user under certain circumstances for no discernable reason as far as they can see (no route available). 


And the issues directly related to the not having everyone on the planet on lightning at first:

1. Small payments consolidating into larger ones, such as a retailer who needs to pay vendors, will fail to route on Lightning, and the loop between the source of the payments(end users) and their destinations(retailers) is broken. This means every channel will ""flow"" in one direction, and need to be refilled to resume actually being used.

2. Refilling every channel will be at least one onchain transaction, possibly two. If this happens twice a month, 1mb blocks + segwit will only be able to serve 4 million users. Some estimates are that Bitcoin already has 2-3 million users.

3. Regardless of lightning's offchain use, Bitcoin must still have enough transaction fees to provide for its network security. Except instead of that minimum fee level being shouldered by 1000 - 500000 million transactions, it is only shouldered by ~170 million transactions with segwit 1mb blocks.
That situation doesn't exist in a vacuum. Users will have a choice - They can go through all that, deal with all of those limitations, odd failures &amp; risks and pay the incredibly high fees for getting on lightning in the first place... Or they can just buy Ethereum, use a SPV wallet, and have payments confirmed in 15 seconds for a fraction of the fees. Or roughly the same choice for SPV+BCH.

The choice will be obvious.

My (and many others) opinion is that lighting is not near as good as people think it will be... It just isn't a scaling solution. Lightning is fine for use cases that need to do frequent, small, or predictable payments with few entities. For example, mining pools paying PPLNS miners. Or gamblers making small bets on gambling sites. Or traders making frequent trades on exchanges.

But as a general purpose scaling solution for average people? It sucks, and they are absolutely not going to go through all of that shit just to use crypto, especially not with better, cheaper, more reliable options out there.",1525872662

This is not true. Where did you get this information. There is no mechanism in the BOLT specification that requires knowing the channel state of all nodes. This is simply not true at all. Try it yourself. You'll see what happens, sending a tx doesn't even consider liquidity of the route. The payment succeeds or it fails. Period. If it fails a new route is tried. It succeeds or it fails. Period.

No, they either route it or they don't. If they stop routing payments you find another peer with better uptime. End of story. Same with Bitcoin Peers.

"There was insanely high fees from november to december (approximately)

Right now, the fees varies. You'll still have to pay a bit for first block confirmations at high traffic times, but currently the mempool pretty much empties every day. Which means that 1 sat/b has a very high probability of go through same day, at least.

Now, I fully well know that this won't last, necessarily. So does everyone else. 

Luckily, fees are a product of data size, not of transaction amount. This means that at the times of insane high fees, it was still very economically feasible to do moderate to high transaction and have a fee rate which wasn't too bad. The largest problem was the tendency of wallets to always overshoot by a margin in the fee estimates, leading to galloping fees.

The fee rates we have now, is a combination of wallets having gotten better in their estimates, and less number of ineconomic transactions. During the high fee periods, there was all the time a very large number of clearly systematically generated transactions that was clearly uneconomical in nature, they were more or less sending bitcoin back and forth between the same addresses.

Since it was uneconomical, and didn't really have a PR effect at all, I think it stopped for that reason. I do believe there were a number of entities trying to artificially raise the fees. We're seeing less of that today.

Other than that, small value transactions is more likely to be feasible on the Lightning Network than on-chain. You can already today try it out - there is a few useful services on it, but to be honest mostly there's proof of concept services nowadays. As a BTC owner, I took the choice around christmas that I would be among the first to be ready for production lightning when it was ""recommended for production"", and set out to be ready for LN at the time that LN was ready for me. I now run a Lightning node on the network, in addition to more or less accepting I'll use my Eclair wallet as my main mobile spending wallet now, since I want both Lightning and on-chain transactions.

As mentioned in another answer, https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/ is a good site to get fee estimates. I personally like https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#1,2h better, it shows trends in a better way for me, but I realize that understanding the charts take a bit to get used to.

"there has never been a double spend on a merchant since Bitcoin began, that is a complete boogie man

0-conf is **signifigantly** safer than credit cards for a merchant, and they most likely have much more stolen card usage/problems than ever having to worry about a double spend attempt

and all of this assumes the merchant has no security/cameras on their pumps

I said it was silly, but the more you keep me thinking about this the dumber it is for a merchant to **ever** have to worry about a double spend attempt for in person purchases as there is many other avenues to prosecute a person that steals and the merchant.

LN micro-payments is **maybe** good for tiny internet **streaming** services that benefit from taking constant payments, otherwise it is pointless as 0-conf will always be easier and safer than a LN payment that could fail at any time for numerous reasons where 0-conf transactions will never fail, just have a little more risk for in person purchases and greater risk for online/large purchases",1525871445

"If you have 10 pieces of cake, they're the same amount of the cake divided into 100 pieces. What the fiat system is to say that the cake magically gets bigger the more you divide it.

Bitcoin says: redefine your perception of one piece instead of splitting it into ever smaller pieces (inflation).

The cake is growing the same in both systems (available resources and production for the slowly growing cake).

Deflationary systems (such as gold) worked fine, but politicians had no wand to magically create more pieces of which they give themselves the most of. They cannot create gold or bitcoins for free.

Tldr: growth might be slower in a non fiat system (hard to tell) but politicians must ask the population for taxes to finance things. Now they have unlimited resources by inflating everyone else's savings.

But that's delusional.

Those addresses must have a communication channel open with enough funds to be a valid graph node. And then after delivering the package, those addresses may not be valid any more for subsequent deliveries. The global routing map changes every second and somehow everybody must be on the same page to keep it decentralized. This is nuts.

And:

&gt; You only see LN working as centralized hub-spoke model because it‚Äôs what shills in this community want you to see it that way.

"&gt; You only see LN working as centralized hub-spoke model because it‚Äôs what shills in this community want you to see it that way.

Well, that was uncalled for. And very condescending of you.

&gt; So far you only expressed doubts that it can work and fears that it will only work centralized. You provided no evidence it has to be that way.

I explained my understanding on it based on what's there to see, how it works compared to how Bitcoin works, and the proofs shared by the LN team. They haven't proved it can work as they claim.

But I'm not invested in it, either emotionally nor financially. You seem you are, with nothing to back it except faith. So it's not my problem really. I already did my homework, and I'm satisfied with the choices I made. Regarding LN it really feels a very silly and unnecessary contraption.

&gt; Also you claiming routing problem can‚Äôt be solved is the same fud. It‚Äôs a graph problem, we know algorithms to solve graph problems. Solution doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect for routing to work.

Ok then show me that working solution for the graph problem that LN routing represents. You can't because IT DOES NOT EXIST. For more than a few thousand nodes there is no solution, if you intend to not use the hub and spoke model, no solution at all, either perfect or imperfect.

It's not FUD, and I told you the technical reasons. Nobody except you and LN proponents are asking of me to believe anything without proof, nobody except you and the LN proponents are saying to me not to trust my own understanding.

Let's agree to disagree then. And let's see in a year how the situation has evolved. OK?

RemindMe! 1 year ""who was really full of shit regarding LN?""",1525869414

"&gt; On August 1, 2017, Bitcoin ~~upgraded removing the 1MB transaction limit~~ continued on as if nothing happened and a fork of Bitcoin, which has since tried to pretend to be Bitcoin, known as Bitcoin Cash was created. It is functionally no different from any other altcoin.

...
&gt; There is now Bitcoin **(BTC)** ~~BCH and Bitcoin BTC both forks are competing for hashrate during this upgrade process.~~ and many, many altcoins, one of which is ""Bitcoin"" Cash, which is called BCash for disambiguation purposes. A consensus is **constantly** reached ~~when one of the forks is orphaned.~~ by the blockchain, which is a consistent proof of work, as is written in the whitepaper, which ""BCashers"" claim supports their views but for some reason fail to read. Ever.

...
&gt;  They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of
valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on
them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.

Since Bitcoin rejects BCH blocks, obviously, consensus is that BCH is something other than bitcoin. 

&gt; ""The jury is still out.""

You think this needs a jury? The definition is clear. No idea why you're even arguing? Are you actually paid to write this nonsense or are you just so invested in BCash that you're hoping to slingshot its value by convincing people it's the real deal...? Because that's *fraud* you realize. That's just straight up wrong.

&gt; so while either fork can dominate both are Bitcoin.

And by the quoting of the whitepaper, you are wrong. Obviously and completely.",1525869221
"I think the motivations Buffet/Gates are pretty easy to understand.  

1 - There is a nugget of truth in the 'pyramid scheme' hyperbole.  Just like with any investment, it only goes up because more people want it in the future.  Even fiat currency follows this principle were it not for inflation typically countering it.  

2 - They've made fortunes under the legacy system.  This means both that they don't appreciate the circumstances under which cryptocurrency can be superior (avoiding rampant inflation in banana republics, non-access to banks, easy transmission, etc.) and also that they have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo.

If BTC or any crypto become hugely successful, I think there will be a time when, like gold, it becomes a stable and relatively boring investment.  At that point, yes, there will certainly be better investment options.  Ignoring all of the democratizing, liberating effects that would bring to the world population, however, is fairly shortsighted to say the least.",1525869218

"I didn't realise there was an argument.

I'm not sure how your questions relate to what we're talking about?

However, what the point is, is that the way Bitcoin is *supposed* to work, is developers should be competing to innovate, with the mining community voting on the best rule changes to the protocol, backing their votes with Proof of Work.

However, Bitcoin Core have been hostile to any developers with different ideas, using smear campaigns, public ridicule, DDoS attacks, exile and censorship (basically every trick in the book) as tools to control the development.

This would not be a problem if there were a spread of competing clients.

Prime evidence is the current state of BTC, being that it has an arbitrary blocksize cap in place with no working Layer 2.

If development was decentralised, what would have happened (should have) is that Blockstream and their buddies would be pitching LN to the miners, alongside any other proposed solutions from competing teams, *when it is ready*.

Instead, they strangled the base layer with no working layer 2 through social and political manipulation, not the least of which was the classic bait and switch that was SegWit2x, where they agreed to a compromise and then renegged as soon as segwit was implemented, effectively getting what they wanted through the use of dirty tricks. A result that every indication shows that most of the community did not want.

What they did not count on, was that Bitcoin would split off, effectively decentralising itself again. Now we have development competition, but instead of between clients, it's happening on two different Blockchains.

Turns out Bitcoin *is* actually pretty resilient after all.",1525869095

"Oh boy this guy is wrong in many of his assumptions, not sure where even to begin, but I do appreciate his article. Was a nice read. 

&gt;It‚Äôs true that tampering with data stored on a blockchain is hard, but it‚Äôs false that blockchain is a good way to create data that has integrity.

Except, blockchain is opensource and all is data can be publicly viewed. The idea is not the inherit poster of data needs to integrit, but that the transparency allowes users to verify it themselves. He addresses this too by saying users won't do this but when you take Wikipedia as an example, you can confirm community based data can actually be factual, more so than a single entity. 

&gt;Another example: the¬†purported advantages¬†for a voting system in a weakly-governed country. ‚ÄúKeep your voting records in a tamper-proof repository not owned by anyone‚Äù¬†sounds¬†right‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyet is your Afghan villager going to download the blockchain from a broadcast node and decrypt the Merkle root from his Linux command line to independently verify that his vote has been counted? Or will he rely on the mobile app of a trusted third party‚Ää‚Äî‚Äälike the nonprofit or open-source consortium¬†administering the election¬†or providing the software?

Yes, either will do fine actually. Both are still poor in user experience but are miles better than relying on government to verify your vote (hint you can't that way). A blockchain just for voting or even just a smartcontract will be soo lightweight that only UX/UI issues are the real issues. A client/node will always be third party created since no one every would use the described way above to connect to the blockchain. Being opensource is a great solution and bad actors will always get rolled up.

&gt;Blockchain systems are supposed to be¬†moretrustworthy, but in fact they are¬†the least trustworthy systems in the world. Today, in less than a decade,¬†three successive top bitcoin exchanges¬†have been hacked, another is¬†accusedof insider trading,¬†the demonstration-project DAO smart contract got drained. 

Again with this shit, blockchains ARE reliable, it's the third-parties that aren't. These are centralisation and regalulatory issues which is the whole reason people are building DEX's and putting out KYC's before applying. This is not an inherit problem with blockchain, but an inherit problem with *any new asset class/technology*. We've seen the in the dotcom bubble allready. 

&gt;In each case,¬†even¬†if the transaction is effectuated via a smart contract, in practice you‚Äôre relying on trust of a counterparty or middleman, not your self-protective right to audit the software, each man an island unto himself. The contract still works, but the fact that the promise is written in auditable software rather than government-enforced English makes it¬†less¬†transparent, not¬†more¬†transparent.

Correct, this would apply to *most* users who are incapable of verification themselves. The idea is still that *more verificators* can rules out 1 single entity. In this example, if the government would actually implement it themselves you can at least have people validate their enforcement. It's not a zero sum game with only 2 options, it may also be an *extra* layer of transparency. Even if you'd choose government-enforced-only, that is in no way *more* transparent.

&gt; You read that right: the company¬†Ripple¬†decided the best way to move money across international borders was to¬†not use Ripples.

I don't like Ripple but that's a lie too. Xrapid uses XRP, Xcurrent doesn't. Banks prefer Xcurrent (which is the point why I think XRP is overvalued) but still it is definitely used! 

&gt;Blockchain systems do not magically make the data in them accurate or the people entering the data trustworthy, they merely enable you to audit whether it has been tampered with.

Yes it does! This isn't magic, this is community based fact checking, transparent and verifiable by everyone. Again, he adresses this for most people which is true, but on heck of a lot better than *1 single point of failure*. Bad actors can be ruled out, whereas in centralised systems they can't. Either there system failes or people are stuck with using data they can no longer trust. Watch a biased newsstation, don't like it, don't watch it. Don't like a blockchain direction (example btc), fork away (example bch) and have exactly the same data but without the bad actors. 

Imma stop here, to much in the article and I'm sure a lot more is adressed in the comments. If his point is to warn investors I wholeheartedly agree, but the options in blockchain are far more behind his comprehension.",1525868778

"&gt; To receive your counter party needs to preload your channel for you.

As I understood everyone should have 5+ channels opened. Why wouldn't you as a merchant open channel with your employees, your suppliers, some customers  and/or some random well connected hubs? That way you would distribute that 5BTC cap onto several different channels.

Also, it should be possible to extract BTC from LN without closing a channels using an exchange and some fancy trustless method as well...

&gt; You're a bank giving me a loan. Large interests are going to deploy huge nodes so they can collect these fees.

Problem is banks don't have that much money. The only reason they are able to give loans to people these days is because fractional reserve. They will have to find investors, and then there is a question: Who would want to open node with bank as any business with enough money can compete?

"I don't have the faith you have in this technology for sure. I believe I would have to delude myself to think it can work in practice.

I've not seen any proof whatsoever that the routing problem can be solved. Comparing it to package deliveries doesn't make sense to me. It's not just the normal node routing, but it has to take channel balances into account which makes routes change with every transaction, making it orders of magnitude harder.

A more appropriate example woudl be like if DHL or USPS had to deliver the packages not to the destination address directly, but to find an interemdiary address, that has to be able to deliver to another intermediary address... Those addresses must have a communication channel open and with enough funds. And after delivering each package, those addresses may not be valid any more for subsequent deliveries.

And a LN node has nothing to do with a BTC miner node. A LN is the equivalent to an SPV wallet. Electricity spend for miners is a business expense, which enables them to earn money, and they are incentiviced to keep investing in order to ensure their gains.

But normal users wont bother running a LN node which is many times more time consuming and money consuming that using a wallet app, when running it it's not their business. The only way I can see it playing out is large hubs run by businesses acting as money transmmiters and subject to AML/KYC laws, and investing a lot of money in keeping channels well fund, running watchtowers, etc, and earning by routing commisions.",1525866052

"&gt; what centralizing forces?

The biggest one, routing (or the lack of a scalable routing system, that ensures the only way LN would work is with massive ""liquidity"" nodes who can be connected to most people and who maintain large balances. AKA centralization

Let me quote /u/skolvikings78 [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8hw8ko/is_ln_centric_scaling_actually_scaling_worse_than/dynlkng/) because he explains it better than I could do:

&gt; It's not. With bitcoin, every transaction must be broadcast to every full node, which in practice has shown to be about 1-5k nodes to support an indefinite (and possibly unlimited) number of users. So for a simple transaction, 5,000 messages of 255 bytes each must be sent around the globe.

&gt; With LN and it's current path finding/routing system, every transaction must be broadcast to every node, which in this case is every participant. This means that for a network of 100,000 users/nodes, the first thought is that 1 transaction requires the sending and receiving of 100,000 messages of XXX bytes (insert estimated LN TX size, which will likely be larger than  bitcoin's).

There are more, like the excessive complexity of use for non-technical people, the need to have the funds in an online computer to receive payments, watchtowers to make sure your funds are not stolen, the need to worry about balances in channels and whether they became unavailable when you need to use them...

Nothing of that encourages decentralization. It makes it hard for the little guys, and for people that just need something simple to use, and don't have the time or the money to worry about technical details, and [hypercomplex systems](https://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf) with undesirable side-effects.

"Too true. It's easy to look back and say in hindsight ""wow, I wish I could've bought X number of years ago and struck it rich"" - especially if the first thing you look at is a linear price graph - but the reality is very, very different.

Imagine buying/mining some bitcoin in 2010 (worth fractions of a cent at the time) and watching it slowly climb up and up. One day it goes on the mother of all bull runs. It passes 5c. Then 10c. Then 50c. You're on cloud nine. Holy shit, it just reached $1! This magic internet money I bought is going to make me rich!

But suddenly, it crashes from $1 all the way down to 30c. ""What was I thinking?! I got greedy. I should've sold at the top. That money could've bought me a new PC!"". You browse your favourite bitcoin discussion forum and suddenly all these threads are popping up mocking ""bagholders who bought at the top for $1"".

There have been plenty of times in the history of this market when things have looked very, very bleak. Even just last year there was a crash around July which I'm sure many people thought was the end of Ethereum. [I stumbled across this video the other day from just July last year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiXS_jjJYY8). This was right after Ethereum crashed from its all time high of ~$400 all the way down to sub-$150. It's literally making fun of holders. ""Mum, it's going to recover, right?"" etc. Of course, as we know it did recover and went all the way to $1400 in early January.

Everything always seems so bleak in the moment. This market is a wild ride.

Verge claims: untraceable. Tech says since 2014 and earlier: still traceable. Scientific papers can be found through ""address clustering bitcoin"" on Google, like: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8260674

The blockchain itself is is already deanonymized since almost all entry or exit points into and out of the blockchain need you to give out your ID. Exchanges or shops. And so your address clusters are tagged.

IP obfuscation is a buzzword. Every bigger coin has obfuscation through the node network itself (you simply can't tell which node broadcasted a transaction first. You would have to own a HUGE part of the network to accomplish this). What TOR hides is that you USE Verge, but then you are using TOR, and is this really less suspicious?

Verge is not private, the developer is a douchebag who accidentally hardforked last time. The windows wallet needs 45+minutes to start up every time, Linux wallet doesn't compile, stealth address are copied from OpalCoins opqaue addresses.

"I believe in Bitcoin, and a few other coins. That being said, I don‚Äôt think anyone can truly say that it‚Äôs not a risky investment. 

I don‚Äôt know a great deal about Warren Buffet‚Äôs investment strategy, but I am quite sure that it‚Äôs based on seeing something that works. I.e. Coca Cola is sold everywhere in the world every single day, which in turn must mean that it‚Äôs a quite low risk long term investment. 

At the minute, most people that own Bitcoin wouldn‚Äôt dream of using it, so its purpose is purely speculation.

I also don‚Äôt believe that banks will go down. It‚Äôs just not going to happen, and if it did, they would just get replaced with Bitcoin banks. 

But I can see it becoming an alternate method of payment. The risk is whether that actually happens or not. And that risk is significantly higher than the risk of Coca Cola going bankrupt, for example. 

I think people are a bit too quick to call Buffet an old crusty white billionaire dude who knows nothing of the future.

"Bitcoin has intent, and its fingerprints are all over, you have to be daft not to see it.

Why on earth did you think Satoshi minted the first block with the seed: ""Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks""!? Of every possible choice he had to pick a seed from he specifically chose one that captured the entire essence of contemporary Central Bank folly. Satoshi could not possibly have been more blunt about the political and ideological intent of his invention.

For _everyone_ with political leanings towards liberty Bitcoin screams at you that it is the personification of what sound money should be like. If you google Bitcoin in combination with words like liberty, libertarian, liberalism, capitalism, anarcho-capitalism etc you will get millions, tens of millions of hits. Try doing the same adding keywords like marxism, communism, socialism. Strangely enough there are very few hits and the hits you get is that Bitcoin will be their end. Bitcoin is _incredibly_ political and ideologically oriented, its intent is to change the political landscape of the entire planet.

Every central banker in the world shuns it and they have issued hundreds of warnings for people to 'stay away' from bitcoin. Do you seriously think all of this is just a technological coincidence?

Bitcoin was forged after all previous attempts to create a free competing currency failed. Literally every parameter has been designed to circumvent the mechanisms that had landed founders of prior attempts of free marked currencies in jail, eg e-gold or liberty dollar.

Just reading the very first sentence in the white paper:
""A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online
payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution""

Satoshi specifically points out that 'financial institutions' are _out_, they are going to become redundant. Its kind if impossible to reach any other conclusion (considering the genesis seed) that 'financial institution' literally means 'Central Bank accredited Banks'. And just using the word 'cash' here, in a paper describing an electronic currency, is definitely meant to trigger associations like: untraceable and anonymous. Its a frontal attack on the established financial system in every sense.

All of this is not 'arbitrary lines', its the origin on Bitcoin and words/variables Satoshi used determined what people caught interest early on.

And this ideological belief is still strong, just listen to any number of people revolving around Bitcoin who's podcasts are regularly voted to the top, like: Jeffrey Tucker, Stefan Molyneux, Richard Falkvinge etc. There are _many_ more.

It is exactly this belief that is the reason why hundreds of thousands of miners ended up being pointed at Bitcoin Cash _at a loss_ after the split. The idea was more important than the money. And the idea is _exactly_ as Satohis first sentence in the whitepaper: The transactions should be _peer to peer_. Lightning requires hub, read ""financial institutions"", to function.

You are free to perceive the world though your of facet / prism. But its fucking smart to be able to have a multitude of prisms in your bag so you can put them on and perceive the world how other people perceives it. You dont have to agree, but when you say that its crap that Satoshi did't have a vision you have to understand that there are hundreds of thousands of people who disagree. They get out of bed every morning making economic choices in the crypto sphere based on this belief. This is why Bitcoin Cash will prosper as long as Bitcoin is in the ideological desert it's currently in. This is why people will mine it at a loss.

"Hi guys, 

A friendly advice.  Right now is a great time to go a bit into low cap ""shit"" coins (like 10-15 of them).  Why?  Because a lot of people lost money today and when they lose money, there is a growing desire to gamble to win it back.  The people who start runs on these shitcoins realize this and will try to start a run.  That is point #1. 

Point #2 is around this time (before East coast wakes up) is the perfect time for shitcoins to go on a run.  Because they need to increase their volume and want to start this run because when the Americans wake up, they will see that some shitcoin has gone up 30-40% and it jump in (and lose money but that's another story).  So right now is the perfect time to get in at the ground floor.  And because you don't know which ones are going to moon, the suggestion is that when BTC dips again, you pick like 10-15 and spread your money.

Both BCH and BTC is already way too centralized, there's only a few large mining pools dominating the mining. As a new miner, you obviously want to join a profitable mining pool, and increasing the costs (bandwidth etc) does eat into the profit of the mining pool. Now, these costs are *not* proportional to the number of miners, they are fixed! Which is the reason we'll never ever see a profitable solo miner ever again. I am willing to accept that. But we don't need pressure for even *more* centralization.

And developer centralization? You probably have read that a company called Blockstream ""owns"" Bitcoin Core?

Here is a pretty nice breakdown of this argument. Bitcoin Core development is already pretty decentralized:
https://medium.com/@whalecalls/fud-or-fact-blockstream-inc-is-the-main-force-behind-bitcoin-and-taken-over-160aed93c003

There's other node implementations run on BTC, as you can see on charts. But Core dominates, because that's the one with a large, decentralized development team and speed of innovation.

The ""centralized development"" is a red herring. And it is not the kind of centralization/decentralization that matters.

"Yes, most people won't profit from a Rasp Pi. The point is that a Rasp Pi uses around 3.5W of energy and it's negligible for the cost of doing business. There will probably be even more energy efficient ways of doing it, like running the node directly on your home router which is online 24/7 already anyway. Or directly on your phone as it becomes practical to hold the entire blockchain on your phone.

I'm not sure whether Lightning can be profitable for anyone at all. Sure you can route fees for huge amounts of people, but the fees are incredibly low, and if you try to increase them beyond what other nodes have, people will just route around you. I really can't see people making gigantic hubs where they have a *high risk*, because loading up large amounts of Bitcoin into hot wallets for LN makes them a prime hacking target.

The multi-path payment is not implemented yet, it's still in design, but it will be possible to completely automate it. [https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2018-February/000993.html]",1525858309

"&gt; People often say that segwit was the precursor to LN, and is a requirement for things to work properly.

&gt; People also say that LN could easily be used on BCH aswell. Is this without a segwit upgrade, or is it possible anyway? 

Segwit did a number of things, especially something called a malleability fix. But the primary benefit of segwit is that it did **not** require a hardfork. Segwit itself was a very, very complex piece of code, ""messy"" even in the eyes of many. There were other proposals that could have enabled the Lightning Network by doing a hardfork, which would have been much cleaner. However, there was a fear campaign against hardforks.

In reality, segwit was entirely unnecessary for LN, as long as you are OK with hardforking, which most coins have no problem with (Bitcoin Cash, Monero, and Ethereum all hardfork on a regular basis). LN is also not a part of bitcoin. It is being built to be put on _top_ of bitcoin, like a luggage rack for a car. The underlying coin is still the underlying coin. Professor Stolfi wrote an excellent overview of why segwit was pushed so hard in this comment (hint: it had nothing to do with technical superiority): 

[link](https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/6ndfut/buttcoin_is_decentralized_in_5_nodes/dk9c27f/)

&gt; Also why wont segwit be implemented in BCH, as blockchain bloat will eventually be a problem anyway. Wouldnt tx/s also go up with this?

BTW bitcoin does have a monetary control its fixed on inception being the 21m coin limit.

Bitcoin could also have been designed to guarantee a fixed inflation of X% (so that blockreward never goes to 0 and is oriented to the inflation rate) but it was not done that way.
I ask myself the question if it was intentional that satoshi chose the 0% consciously. maybe there is no need for inflation

&gt; Btw yours is a very good question and something I struggled with for a while but I eventually warmed to the idea of a deflationary currency.
&gt; A lot of times people will warn off the dangers of a deflationary spiral but that is a myth of bad never actually occurred in history. But there are endless examples of inflationary spirals and hyperinflation. 

I also think deflation is better than inflation because in the end I could not find deflation spirals that were bad in history. There were plenty of inflationary spirals, that's no secret. At the moment I see this deflation thing as more than a experiment waiting to be uncovered. Unfortunately, I find no evidence that this works long term. I think we just have to test it out.

I agree

One definite upside is that ""crypto investors"" have to actually think now whether on-chain scaling makes sense, and miners have to think hard about which coin to mine and to sell or keep.

Doesn't matter what their motives are, only their ability.

Creating conditions such that creating a fork is legally perilous signals to the would-be users that the organization believes that it would be unsuccessful when competing for users' votes.

If the organization behind VeChain believes I might not vote for them then why care about what I have to say? Go ask them why they think they wouldn't get my vote, they should know better than me.

Regardless of what people think, I can sell any denomination of coin without using another platform specific coin to simply *be allowed to sell or buy such a low amount* on 99.99% of every other exchange. It's as if simply drinking the same poison we didn't like with banks.  Fees, charges, handling, etc. All that shit. In my eyes Binance is trying to beat everyone to being the next shitty bank everyone ends up is convinced is trying to rule the world.

Is poloniex perfect, no but they don't pull that shit. How about bittrex? Also not perfect. The thing I actually find the worst (And perhaps this is a personal bandwidth and geographical location issue) is there trade view is garbage. Most of the time I will have to reload the page several times before it starts working, and whenever I want to switch coins their shit drop-down menu lags out and just is unresponsive. Binance, were dealing with fucking fast money, something your competitors who are somehow again;  threw popular opinion- are apparently shittier then you in somehow every respect... **except for this cat, every one else's tradeview doesn't end up making me the ultimate bag holder durring day trading**. I technically cannot under no sane circumstances, make the money I'm also risking on Binance at all in contrast to even attempting on poloniex or bittrex, bitstamp or nearly any other 'smaller' competitor. The only reason these guys ever beat any other older exchange was threw attempting to monopolize the market threw their own token sale- which we all know they've also reaped the bennifits of from a rising price. 
The token for actual trade use is garbage- no one on the planet but Binance wants to use bnb tokens. That's not really a crypto currency as much as it is a scheme.

Yes I use Binance and I'm not a very happy camper, and I'm nearly willing to bet they've already paid an army of Reddit accounts to hunt these subs and downvote anything ill said against them and then spout some horse shit Binance propaganda. 

If your wondering what I use Binance for; longs and only when I cannot find the token threw any other ok-ish exchange.

Simply put; Fuck any exchange that creates this double standard monopoly bullshit. If they took away the Binance token or created a total new use for It, let me not just turn my shitty *dust* balance into nearly nothing in Binance tokens and also fix all latency issues or tech issues of their apparently *#1* platform which again is fucking retarded- I can day trade on my phone with poloniex if I chose, but I can't even use a laptop to attempt a feat on Binance; then I'd ok with them, but again if they don't change their philosophy on how they do business and present themselves soon- then really their not at all different then *the corrupt and moral less banks that they in part want us to abandon for crypto*.

"&gt; BCH has existed for such a short amount of time that judging its daily volume is ridiculous.

BCH is as old at BTC. It benefited 1:1 from BTC's network on Aug 1st. It's disingenuous to say that BCH is new.

&gt;I haven‚Äôt called anything the true bitcoin. They‚Äôre all different experimental versions of an open source protocol with different ideologies backing them. There will be more versions. Most of them shit, but I personally find BCH interesting enough not to fire sell and to watch closely.

Bitcoin refers to the chain, consensus rules and supporting network, not the white paper or a knock-off. If BCH captured the network around Aug 1, *it* would be Bitcoin. But it didn't.

&gt;Sure 8 billion ppl won‚Äôt be able to use BCH daily. 8 billion can‚Äôt use any crypto daily. What‚Äôs your point?

LN+Segwit+Schnorr+~200 mb blocks can easily support that.

&gt;I didn‚Äôt say both sides are right, I said there‚Äôs nothing but speculation fueling a fire that does no one any good in crypto.

It's not *just* speculation. The differences between BTC and BCH and their respective chances at success are not just up to the fate of the gods.

in consequence all the people that were here before the hype took their money to never come back in the market again.
Leaving 2 kinds of people :

- the ones waiting for cryptos to come back so they can get their money back
- the ones coming in with hopes for it to rise again like last time and make money

In addition to this situation, the hype being gone, and lot of people learned that a lot of money were lost over this, people learning about crypto now are reluctant to invest in such a dangerous thing.

the result is that any new investment doesn't lead to a significant increase since too much people will sell over it.

Plus, as you said, it's not like holding a share, there's no inherent value related to it. and the few companies that could really use it, there is less than people think, with new regulations will tend to create their own private blockchain...

"BTC didn't increase blocksize previously. It actually lowered it. I think a lot of people had - and still have - the assumption that it'd grow if it was needed. I do too.
 But as Bitcoin has become increasingly popular quite fast, the realization last years among main developers in the BTC area is that the most important work is to *limit* this growth.

Noone has ever said it shouldn't grow, though. What is said is that it should grow as little as possible, and that ""it's impossible to pay very small fee for next block confirmation"" is *not* a good reason to increase it.

Btw, Segwit *was* actually an effective blocksize increase. People that worry about low fees has had ample time to migrate to segwit transactions by now, and it gives a healthy discount.

Other than that, there is a few other transaction optimizations in store. Schnorr, for example, will make multi-input transactions cost much less to perform than now. Segwit is the building block in much of these optimizations.",1525851269

"&gt; RBF is (...) a feature built into the original design of bitcoin

Careful with the ellipsis, please; the omission alters the the meaning of my statement. [The transaction replacement strategy in Satoshi's original bitcoin client](https://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/code/1/tree/trunk/main.cpp#l427) did not require additional fees be paid, so it was not RBF. The lack of fees early on in bitcoin's history meant the feature could be abused.

&gt; you claimed that BCH community is averse to this because we are averse to RBF.

Maybe I'm misreading the general sentiment, but it seems to me that most BCH supporters disapprove of any transaction replacement strategy which may effectively evict unconfirmed transactions in favor of new versions. Personally, I find RBF to be the most palatable of the bunch, but if you know another approach with widespread support, I'm all ears.

"&gt;  My point is that the user base, adoption, and txns for monetary exchange seem to be increasing based upon community sentiment.

Why use sentiment when you can just look on the blockchain and the markets. TXs are super low, exchange volume is pretty low, the price is still pretty low. It certainly doesn't paint a healthy picture for 'the true Bitcoin' or whatever.

&gt;Big blocks don‚Äôt necessarily hit a wall eventually. There‚Äôs no data to support this.

There absolutely is tons of research to support this. Don't buy BCH propaganda just because they say it's fine.

&gt;That‚Äôs no different than me saying LN can‚Äôt work because... it can‚Äôt. That‚Äôs ridiculous. It may, and block scaling may work as well for an indeterminate user base size.

Let me clarify. Scaling on chain will never be able to scale to 8 billion people for even one transaction per day and still remain decentralization enough to have any store of value properties. Plus it would be unbelievably inefficient and pointless compared to a centralized normal database.

&gt;Hope you don‚Äôt see this as debate,

IT sort of is though, is it not?

&gt; I‚Äôm simply saying no one really knows shit. 

I understand your point and there's validity but some people *do* know shit enough to know that on-chain scaling to the degree that BCH wants to is really stupid. Also, being anti-Segwit is fucking retarded but it's part of the narrative, so BCashers tow the line. Just remember that there aren't two sides to every story.

&gt;I‚Äôm tired of couch touring experts (not referencing you) trolling or acting like know it alls in these subs. It‚Äôs ruining proper discourse and discussion. If nothing else, this is a generally decent exchange.

Again, I don't see how both sides can be right. Perhaps you just haven't research or thought about the issue enough (not judging). It's a scam though, dude. I'm not saying the price (and ratio) won't go up further, they might. But at the end of the say this is a lame-ass knockoff being pedaled by some of the worst actors in the space. When Craig and Roger are your main spokespeople, you are probably holding a pump and dump coin. 

Whatever though. At least there's one reasonable person in this sub who isn't just shoveling the same ""Satoshi's Vision"" shit into the furnace. ",1525850813
"Ignoring the fact Bitcoin will almost certainly not switch to PoS (as this is a much less secure way of creating a blockchain), the block time is to synchronize the network (i.e. make sure everybody has the same blockchain) and has very little to do with the PoW computational time. 

One can  create a PoW coin (e.g. Ethereum) with very short block time. It creates a lot of problems, including a high rate of block orphaning. In Bitcoin, [orphaning is extremely rare](https://blockchain.info/orphaned-blocks) while in [Ethereum it happens every few minutes](https://etherscan.io/blocks_forked). For Ethereum, since the orphaning is so common, one has to wait many more confirmations to be sure one follows the longest chain than in case of Bitcoin. Therefore, the only benefit is the reduced stochasticity. In case of Bitcoin, 6 confirmations can be 60 minutes on average but may be more than 400 in case of bad luck (or 5 minutes in case of good luck) while security-equivalent 240 Ethereum confirmations would take one hour with much smaller variance. 

High rate of orphaning creates an incentive for miner centralization because the larger the miner, the lower rate of orphaning. Ethereum fights it with paying also for the orphans (uncle rewards) which  may only work in an infinitely inflationary environment that Bitcoin consensus will likely never accept.

I don't see any name calling going on here.

Bitcoin Cash has seen a major trend in *on-chain* application development (Yours, Memo, Blockpress, etc) which is advancing, and we know that op_codes coming online will probably enhance this.

"&gt; BTC has had many hard forks? Please list three.

You realize that anyone can (and has) forked Bitcoin at any time, right? Notice how that doesn't bring down Bitcoin? That's because nobody wants to mine that shit because it's worthless. The only 'real' contentious fork is BCH and the whole ploy is just ridiculous. You guys got what you wanted and nothing came of it. The only reason this has any value is because Roger and Jihan colluded to mine and hype the thing up and then people started trading it because it was a free dividend on a different network. It's not like this was even all that contentious to begin with. Compare the hashing power and price between the two. BCH isn't even close to flipping BTC and yet everyone here is having a wet dream. The metrics look *absolutely terrible* for BCH but everyone acts like everything is great. It's a seriously strange cult. 

&gt;A block size upgrade on BTC will always be contentious, because BTC has ejected almost everyone who supports block size increases from the community. 

Bullshit. Your poster-hate-boy Greg is for block size increases. You're just making shit up to fit your agenda.

&gt;I was ejected in 2014.

No you most certainly weren't. This is open source **consensus-base** software protocol. If you disagree with the rules then you fork and do your own code, which is exactly what happened. But the it's a defunct project and everyone knows it. It's just like the 1000 other alts that are worthless but are still traded at somewhat-real valuations. It's a game, similar to penny stocks.

"As far as I understand it, the block sizes will get bigger and bigger, and eventually become absolutely massive. There are only 20k Bch transactions a day, and the blockchain is over 160 gigs (to be fair a lot of that was inherited from the original network), compared to there being over 150 million visa transactions every day. The Bch chain is growing at about 15 gigs a year if I'm not mistaken with a steady rate of 10k to 20k transactions. If it were doing 150m transactions instead, it wouldn't be growing at 15 gigs a year, it's be growing at 120,000 gigs a year. Even with bigger and bigger hard drives, without some solution, this will get unsustainable, unless you want to use a light wallet or web wallet. But that's not so much ""being your own bank"" anymore.

Also, the time it takes for a transaction to send, especially through places like exchanges, are way longer than a visa transaction takes. This will only get slower over time with more and more people using the network. I think their solution is to keep increasing block sizes as needed, but again, I don't think that's the best approach when trying to compete with transactions that take less than 3 seconds.

It's fine for a relatively-large scale currency, and I'm honestly glad they're trying to make bitcoin more usable, but to ""replace fiat"", it's gonna need to be *better* than visa.",1525850050
