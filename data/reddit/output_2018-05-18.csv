You did what every person says they'd do when/if they got rich, and you actually did it. I am just in awe of that.

Also did the charities sell their btc at the peak price or has their value declined now?

In decentralized systems, users should take over control. And the responsible people maintaining the system must be willing to give up control to the users.
Users must be front and center of any decentralized system.
So, when the majority of the users call a coin only ""Bitcoin"", just for the sake of simplicity, than it is the ""real Bitcoin"". 
Thats a very long way to go. Keep on improving your coin, put the interests of the users in front and center of all you do, and then maybe over time, a fork of Bitcoin became just ""Bitcoin"".
But maybe, if the communities of the different bitcoin forks continue the pointless infighting, an other coin will emerge and take over the dominant position then maybe next to nobody will care about the old ""Bitcoin"".

Usability issues will be ironed out, and there's no reason that LN will be ultimately any more difficult to understand than Bitcoin, since users will not even touch the Bitcoin layer for most purposes, and will be dealing mostly with LN channels.

For example, exchanges will be able to load money directly into existing LN channels, or open up the LN channel to a user. Users will just need to run the software and copy/paste their node ID to the exchange.

You don't need to explain HTTPS to a user for them to use the web. The majority of users will not need to know what this ""lightning network"" thing is, other than they need an app on their phone to pay for things with a QR code or eventually, NFC will probably be ubiquitous.",1526711609

"i am not implying (and im definitely not directly stating) that blockchain was viewed as a useful technology until bitcoin became popular. No argument there.

If you boil down what i said, it basically says: blockchain existed, someone found a way to make it useful as the basis for a currency (bitcoin), that made it popular, now companies are experimenting with blockchain tech (but not necessarily crypto currencies) because it became popular. 

just because bitcoin made blockchain tech popular doesnt mean blockchain has no utility without it. I think its pretty clear at this point that blockchain has a variety of uses, many of which have nothing to do with currency. As it stands, bitcoin's only use case is a store of value. bitcoin made blockchain popular, but the adoption and success of blockchain is becoming less and less connected with the success of bitcoin.",1526711254

In fact, also said I can't expect others to do the same, but it is toxic posts/replies/ debates that keep the noobs hiding among the BTC trolls out of fear for retaliation. Once you show live and respect you become the safe haven and you become who they look to for saftey and guidance. It is working and I don't care what a few people THINK is the right answer 2 months ago, I felt the same. I always fought back. Why?

"New tether is created and given to the one who deposited fiat - its not created out of thin air (at lrast not theoritically). So whoever deposits USD into banks, gets the equivalent in tether. Tether is not getting BTC from anyone - period.",1526710955
"So spirited. It takes ppl awhile to undue the construct of money. But once you get it. You really get it. I know once I did a lot of things in my life were different. I call it a re evaluation. If or when 1 btc can buy a house it may not be enough for me to part with 1. Which is strange because I used to give btc away so people can understand the technology. But when I woke up I was grateful for what I did but resentful for not understanding the whole picture. The pizza guy ouch. But he is still around too. 

My advice to many reading this. Buy what you can afford. Don’t sacrifice an essential in your life either. That will put pressure on you. Set a schedule on how often you will buy. And stick to it. You are not going to miss out. Don’t focus on the price but have an objective or goal for when you will spend it. Dream big. Never tell anyone including relatives how much you own. Remember that. There is always someone out there who will if you give them the chance try to take them from you. At this point we call them altcoiners. Learn how to store your coins off an exchange. And keep multiple copies of your seed words in secret locations that only you know. Keep up to date at what is happening on the protocol. This is important too because Bitcoin has been under attack for years. This is your money and under no circumstance do you fall for leadership. Bitcoin has no leader. Also understand you are not going to get what you want when it comes to making changes to the protocol. But you don’t have to accept what devs, miners, or businesses think is best for your money. Run a node because that is the only way you can ensure the rules you agree to are true. But if you can’t accept that you are trusting someone else. Ignore the FUD, lies and deceptions from those who really aren’t going to act within your best interest. This maybe your government or those who you place a lot of trust to. Lastly, read and learn as much as you can. ",1526710909

I love Bitcoin and crypto in general. But the idea that it's going to bring down major financial institutions is the stupidest idea. Even if Bitcoin took over as the only form of currency in the entire world, you're telling me that the banks aren't going to find a way to monetize it? That's so blindsided.

Wells Fargo will start offering cold storage of your funds so that it's secure. Don't want to deal with passkeys? How about an access card that's directly linked to your wallet so you can make convenient purchases at the store.

On top of that, humans are greedy, BTC is on top because of 9k price. BCH is next with 1.5k. why do you think the price and adoption grew in BCH? It's because of greed. People see their coin zooming past 1k and everybody rushes into it. BTC literally cannot be used for high speed transactions on-chain.

"&gt; Your articulate comment which attempts to position yourself with a level of superiority

I have no illusions that when it comes to quantum computing, I don't know shit. When it comes to mathematics, I am no better than average. When it comes to quantum theory, I barely understand the basics. When it comes to cryptography, see my comment on mathematics.

I'm calling BS on the basis of the fact that I know, from my own experience, how long even simple things take to turn into real products in the fields of software and engineering, That knowledge, combined with what we know about the actual development of quantum computers that could actually achieve this feat, we are definitely more than 5 years off having commercial solutions that can do that. That is my opinion and as you know, opinions are like arseholes. I can't speculate on information that is not public knowledge.

&gt; Wherever did I state I've ""got it all figured out""? I am precisely making the point that WE HAVE NO IDEA what is being or has already been developed.

To me this is the definition of FUD. I find it hard enough to stick to things we know about rather than the realm of conjecture and imagination.

&gt; Of course this could be a mechanism to boost sales.

This is what I think is more likely. Call me a sceptic.

If the NSA is already cracking encryption with quantum computers we are all fucked, but I really doubt it, personally. There's no public record of any such machines capable of that kind of feat in existence. Modern research papers are still talking about 10 qubit systems. The NSA might be powerful, but quantum computing is right up there with one of the most difficult things humanity has ever tried to accomplish.

So, if you want to keep track, if there are commercially available Quantum computers (that a business or corporation with enough money can buy and use privately) that are capable of cracking Bitcoin within 5 years from today's date, I will eat my own dick. ;)

Those are, for all intents and purposes, The users coins. While the security of said coins is called to question that doesn’t allows them to fall under the exchanges known ownership as u have the ability to withdraw them(at least unless there’s a hack).

No, it's dominant because competing clients that did exactly as you suggest were DDoS'd, banned from major forums, attacked relentlessly on social media, and the authors of which were slandered, bullied, and threatened.

They often disagree about things (take UASF, for example), but they agree on enough that they can work together on a shared project.

Show me one significant change to Bitcoin that Blockstream was not in favor of that got approved and put into the codebase.

&gt; The only reason that core remains the reference client is because people overwhelmingly choose to use it, of their own volition.

Again, you're ignoring history. Core is the reference client because any alternatives that seek to undermine that position are attacked relentlessly, barred from all communication channels, and illegally cyberattacked to kick them off the network. Core literally attacked valid Bitcoin nodes for daring to run an alternative client that was outside their control.

&gt; Approximately 10% of the Bitcoin economy voted with their feet and went with BCH when it launched. That's fine. They were free to do so. But most of the economy stayed with BTC.

15% by price, but by merchant transactions? Like 90%+. Nobody uses BTC for actually buying things anymore. Price will follow, not lead.

&gt; If the maintainers of the core client suddenly said ""we're going to hardfork so that 10% of all miners' fees go to our own development fund, do you think anyone would still run their code? I don't. But according to your statement, they can do ""anything they want"".

I agree, they can't just do anything they want. They can only boil the frog slowly. But, what they CAN do is block any unwanted changes. They are gatekeepers, and that means there is zero chance of anyone stopping this slow crawl towards more and more Blockstream-oriented development. Nobody else has any power.

&gt; Doesn't make any sense to conflate core devs and Blockstream. Contributors to core affiliated with Blockstream make up only a fraction of the core devs, and this has been steadily decreasing over time.

Nobody gives a shit about people who contribute some typo fixes in readmes. Core is controlled by Blockstream. No proposals disliked by Blockstream are able to make their way into Core. That's proof enough.

&gt; Your reaction to that statement should give you an idea of what a BTC proponents reaction is to the equivalent statement about Blockstream.

Not even remotely the same thing. One is based on a history of behavior. The other is based on bullshit. You can't simply take two negative statements and equate them. Facts matter. History matters.

&gt; It should be pretty clear by now that we're not ignoring it. We've heard the arguments that it's an issue right now, and find them unconvincing.

Really, you've heard the arguments? How can you when all your communities are censored and managed so that no organic discussion can take place?

I'm floored to see an account as old as yours be so completely clueless. But then again, people do whatever it takes to justify selling all their BCH at $300 :)",1526708539

Hence, lightning transactions is a big lie. Correct me if my understanding here is wrong.

"**ISO 4217**

ISO 4217 is a standard first published by International Organization for Standardization in 1978, which delineates currency designators, country codes (alpha and numeric), and references to minor units in three tables:

Table A.1 – Current currency &amp; funds code list

Table A.2 – Current funds codes

Table A.3 – List of codes for historic denominations of currencies &amp; funds

The tables, history and ongoing discussion are maintained by SIX Interbank Clearing on behalf of ISO and the Swiss Association for Standardization.

The ISO 4217 code list is used in banking and business globally. In many countries the ISO codes for the more common currencies are so well known publicly that exchange rates published in newspapers or posted in banks use only these to delineate the different currencies, instead of translated currency names or ambiguous currency symbols. ISO 4217 codes are used on airline tickets and international train tickets to remove any ambiguity about the price.

I feel like nano is the type of coin that either moons or stagnates. I don't see it slowly increasing over a long period of time.

"There are few points I really applaud:
1. In the ICO craze, the crypto community lost some of its instinct for honest investor communication
2. Bonds deliver principal-plus-interest; stocks deliver ownership and (sometimes) dividends - both support the economic interests of the buyer 
3. Crypto infesting nice to re-acquaint itself with these principles while retaining the world-changing innovationist represents
4. Tokens should distribute benefits (and risk to holders and also offer all holders a simple interest",1526703050

"It's really hard to measure.

Many transactions don't represent a real transaction because the sender is the receiver. Some represent multiple transactions, like paying two different debts at once.

Most bitcoin traffic doesn't have a l1 transaction at all. On exchange trades, and intra exchange sales don't make any foot print on the blockchain. LN will exacerbate this further.

In short, blockchain stats tell us very little about what's happening with bitcoin.",1526702691
"But I don't  think BCH supporters think BTC coders are writing bad code. They probably are great coders. They just question their intent. 
Maybe the people working on BCH write worse code. But they do it with the intention to keep BCH true to Bitcoin.",1526702683

"**Tax protester constitutional arguments**

Tax protesters in the United States advance a number of constitutional arguments asserting that the imposition, assessment and collection of the federal income tax violates the United States Constitution. These kinds of arguments, though related to, are distinguished from statutory and administrative arguments, which presuppose the constitutionality of the income tax, as well as from general conspiracy arguments, which are based upon the proposition that the three branches of the federal government are involved together in a deliberate, on-going campaign of deception for the purpose of defrauding individuals or entities of their wealth or profits. Although constitutional challenges to U.S. tax laws are frequently directed towards the validity and effect of the Sixteenth Amendment, assertions that the income tax violates various other provisions of the Constitution have been made as well.

"**2012 National Reconnaissance Office space telescope donation to NASA**

The 2012 National Reconnaissance Office space telescope donation to NASA was the declassification and donation to NASA of two identical space telescopes by the United States National Reconnaissance Office. The donation has been described by scientists as a substantial improvement over NASA's current Hubble Space Telescope. Although the telescopes themselves are being given to NASA at no cost, the space agency must still pay for the cost of instruments and electronics for the telescopes, as well as the launch of the telescopes. On February 17, 2016, the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) was formally designated as a mission by NASA, predicated on using one of the space telescopes.

"Well we know developers didn't call if the segwit2x fork like you claimed because aside from Garzik there was almost no developer support. The fact that miners couldn't follow through with the fork on there own shows that the claim that many BCH supporters like to make that only miners count isn't true either. 

I don't agree that segwit2x was called off only because of a successful ""Core NO2X astroturfing campaign."" The main reason I don't agree is that if big block supporters scaling ideas had strong technical merit then a strong majority of the Bitcoin developers would be working in that direction and put their support behind XT, Unlimited, Classic, BCH, segwit2x... But they haven't. 

Right now we basically have a relatively small group of BCH developers saying that they know how to scale better then a much larger group of Bitcoin developers. Most of these people on both sides are basically scientists not politicians. I'd be surprised if the large number of Bitcoin developers are proven wrong by the relatively smaller number of BCH developers.",1526701707

"I really hope this is a genuine attempt to understand the BTC point of view, and isn't just exhibitionism.  Here's what I'd say, assuming the former:

If I'm answering just the title, I'd say this:

It's not a concern, because it's all open source and voluntary.  Even if a malicious group were to take control of the github repository, anyone can still fork the code and write competing software, and no one can force anyone else to run code that they don't want to.  Core is the overwhelmingly dominant client because the majority of people choose to run it.

If I'm answering the text between, I would point out that you're assuming that BTC supporters agree with your premises, and just don't care.  In reality, we are aware that many BCHers believe those three premises, we think they are false.

Let's take the first one:

&gt; **The Core dev group** quite literally controls the BTC protocol now and can do with it anything they want.

You're kind of assuming that the reader agrees with you here.  Many r/btc readers might, but if you're looking to get an answer from a BTC supporter, you should know by now that we think it's a false premise.  I'll explain why I disagree:

There are several things I take issue with.

First is ""The Core dev group"".  This makes it sound as though all core contributors are a monolith.  In reality, there are dozens and dozens of coders, contributing both as individuals and as representatives of companies.  They often disagree about things (take UASF, for example), but they agree on enough that they can work together on a shared project.

If I wanted to, I could talk about ""The BCH dev group"", and discuss them as though they are a single entity.  After all, they all work on the same protocol, and agree on a certain number of things.  You might (rightly) point out that it isn't fair to paint them as all the same, because there are different clients, and they are different people, from different companies, etc.  Sure, there's a difference in that the usage of the clients are more spread out.  But read on to find out why I think that's not important.

&gt; The Core dev group **quite literally controls the BTC protocol now and can do with it anything they want**.

I've already addressed the issue of talking about core devs as though they are a single group, but let's assume that you're right about that for a minute.  Could they control the BTC protocol?  I don't think so.  One should be careful not to conflate the core client with the protocol itself.  The only reason that core remains the reference client is because people overwhelmingly choose to use it, of their own volition.  If the developers of the core client decided to do something that most people didn't like...they would choose to run other software.  Approximately 10% of the Bitcoin economy voted with their feet and went with BCH when it launched.  That's fine.  They were free to do so.  But most of the economy stayed with BTC. 

If the maintainers of the core client suddenly said ""we're going to hardfork so that 10% of all miners' fees go to our own development fund, do you think anyone would still run their code?  I don't.  But according to your statement, they can do ""anything they want"".

In order to remain the client that the market favors in the long run, they have to do what the market favors in the long run.

&gt; Their stated aim, via Blockstream, is to figure out how to make profits with off-chain transactions.

Doesn't make any sense to conflate core devs and Blockstream.  Contributors to core affiliated with Blockstream make up only a fraction of the core devs, and this has been steadily decreasing over time.

Imagine I say this:

&gt; BCH's stated aim, via Bitmain, is to figure out how to make profits through mining centralization.

That would be rather unfair, right?  Bitmain does wield a lot of influence in BCH, but I can recognize that there are substantial portions of BCH's community that aren't part of Bitmain.

Your reaction to that statement should give you an idea of what a BTC proponents reaction is to the equivalent statement about Blockstream.

&gt; Why do BTC supporters ignore development centralization? Why aren't they concerned by one corporation completely controlling BTC development.

It should be pretty clear by now that we're not ignoring it.  We've heard the arguments that it's an issue right now, and find them unconvincing.",1526698639

They bought in December, lost half in a matter of days, and panic sold it all vowing never to trust the internet again. With all the good press cryptos been getting lately, you know that same age demographic is going to get FOMO with dreams of  upgrading their retirement and start calling me again.

"&gt; There may be some basis for them, but it’s a very unreliable way to do these kinds of calculations, and nobody who does this for a living would do it like that. It’s odd that someone would.”

&gt; The same De Vries acknowledged that the numbers of the study were based on estimates and that the paper he wrote is made to raise awareness of the mining energy requirements of the bitcoin network. 

So either it’s lazy work or he’s trying to throw shade on POW. Both are bullish for Bitcoin in my opinion.",1526698433

"Even if BTC volatility decreases, there will always be a subset of cryptos that are volatile AF.",1526698318
"So all that means is the ones with high numbers are transparent about it. Plus the exchange address issue meaning some of those addresses represent tens of thousands of people. For all we know more XLM holders leave XLM on exchanges than BTC holders, leading to a higher number.

There are no real insights that can be gleaned from that data when it can be so easily manipulated. For all we know *all* of them have the same high percentage in the top 100 holders hands. 

You're right though, we can tell from that list that some of them are for sure concentrated, but having a low number on that list means nothing.

Concentration of wealth also has nothing to do with network decentralization. Decentralization is about being immutable and trustless, concentration of wealth does not factor in. I fail to see why people care so much about it, the vast majority of wealth will always be held in the hands of a relatively small amount of people. I understand the visceral reaction of it being unfair, but that's just how life goes. Bitcoin's initial goal wasn't distribution of wealth, it was developing a trustless system that can't be gamed. Manipulation is what decentralization is intended to combat, not concentration of wealth.

A higher # of codebase clients being more decentralized is also something that is subjective, seeing as how even Satoshi thought that Bitcoin should only have one uniform reference implementation.

The node count is really the only thing on that list that can be useful, and even then all of the different cryptocurrencys nodes have different roles. Some have a majority of nodes that simply store the whole history but don't have voting rights, some have only masternodes producing blocks etc...

Also some of those numbers are incorrect. Just as an example, a different IOTA node list that requires you to manually add your node to the list (which means it's far from comprehensive) has 113 nodes online right now while this list has 23. There are also no incentives for IOTA full nodes, so that's wrong too.

I understand the need for metrics to try and quantify decentralization, but it really just isn't that simple. Each has to be taken on a case by case basis, it's virtually impossible to get the whole picture from a few numbers.",1526698093

Thanks for the edit, it was supposed to be ""scamper about"" as in moving quick out of fear or excitement. Good catch. :)

I also appreciate your comments on what i'm working on. I have open source developments in the works for what you have proposed, but it will take time. The main goal is to not put a paywall in front of it since im not about all of these wannabe crypto educators popping up. I'm building as much as I can on Github and plan on hosting there for free, much like the professional forum i'm building.

We are all a in a very niche community and should be helping each other become stable and profitable before we reach mainstream adoption.

On the note of crypto culture, I agree in regards to preserving the sarcastic and informal community. One of the best things about reddit and open source communities, is that you are judged more on your merit and ability to entertain.

My only critique of the crypto culture is to stop scamming each other with the promotion of projects we know are garbage out of financial interest, as well as to stop trying to be experts at everything.

Usable money of course. Which is what the winning crypto would become once it matures and the losers of the race fall by the wayside. Doesn't mean we should stick to the dollar. The dollar and every other fiat were also once volatile until markets allowed them to mature. ,1526690857

In June when the mainnet is released we'll have our answer. But I don't think Vechain is running a potemkin crypto operation, and I'm fairly certain its partners and investors did their due diligence.

Satoshi is the world's hero no.1, but also enemy no.1. The only way to hide is in front of our eyes. He must obfuscate part of the truth in order to survive. Creators of revolutionary products never vanish, they always return back to make better stuff. If you think the opposite, give an example from history.

And why should the early bitcoins be returned to him in 2 years from the trust? Are they fake or not? If yes, why yes? If no, what is the purpose of the trust? Why should Craig get the bitcoins? As per the public appearances, Craig has blatantly said that signing with the right keys doesn't prove the owner. That's the end of Satoshi.

is this your first week in bitcoin? when satoshi gave everyone bitcoin and told us how it was designed to work the users said, yes that can work. then without asking the users and without showing any evidence that *either* satoshi was wrong or that they were right a small group of people made *major* changes to the fundamentals of the system and protocol without consensus from the users and without need.

Not a problem? Did you see how core literally changed BTc into something hardely recognizable as bitcoin? the years of stalemate of answers and then just giving up, then going with a lie backed switcha roo?

I think history shows that you are very mistaken to claiom that there isn't  a problem when anyone who has been a part of bitcoin for a while *knows* there is a problem becuase they ahve seem it. 

Satoshi would have hated the idea of Bitcoin not being p2p, noting being elevronic e-cah, and not evey being a currency even more.

Satoshi created bitcoin so no one would have to run a node, and that some 100,000 mining nodes would exist all over the world, relay nodes were never a thing he thought users should run.

The contrast between their claims and what they actually produced—as seen in Rothstein’s documentary—was staggering.

 I am not saying all Chinese cryptos are scams but  the fact is **with crypto we have nothing to go by except technical merit**. At least if you look at Zilliqa (which I am not invested in) which has a Chinese CEO and quite a few Chinese developers have some very technical detail in their interviews and collaborate with Vitalik, Poon, etc.

"IOTA doesn't claim to be a blockchain, making it irrelevant to this article?

I know nothing of VEN, and cannot speak to that.

There is a narrative I've seen repeated ad nauseam, which boils down to the idea that ""blockchain"" is the real invention, and Bitcoin is just some &lt;insert negative thing here&gt;. It's a way of trying to explain the hype without having to buy in to the Bitcoin narrative.

This article debates against this point of view, and I think the author pretty much nails it. There are some neat applications for blockchain (Bitcoin being the #1 example), but many proposed uses for blockchain are just less efficient ways of doing things we already know how to do. ",1526687272
"I disagree. You have it backwards. Blockchain, which essentially boils down to a triple entry ledger system, existed before bitcoin. Satoshis major input was creating a blockchain based system that could support a currency by introducing a consensus mechanism that aligned the incentives of the network participants with the incentives of the folks who run the network. That is what PoW did, it enabled trustless consensus via game theory by aligning incentives. 

So, crypto currencies wouldn’t exist without the blockchain tech. But the currency part is not what makes blockchain important. It just made it more well known. 

Crypto currencies will likely fade away but the underlying block chain technology will live on. I don’t think that blockchain tech requires decentralization in order to be useful (see: every project that the ideologues in the crypto community hate, the main example being ripple xrp) and i think the crux of your argument is decentralization is what makes it special (i saw your response to some other dissenting voices and this was my takeaway from those comments).

Decentralization and the consensus mechanism is exactly what makes crypto currencies special. But it doesn’t really have any relation to the use of the underlying blockchain tech. Most major companies dabbling in blockchain tech are not developing on decentralized public chains. They are developing private chains for their own specific use cases.

I know this isn’t fitting with the hopes and dreams of the people who supported crypto in the first place and it might not be a popular opinion because it doesn’t support your hopes and desires, however i believe it to be objectively accurate. It doesn’t support my hopes and desires either but alas that is life!

"That's incredibly naive.  I see this time and time again, where Devs of suspect coins dump during peaks.  Do you honestly think it's a coincidence that the supply is 8,999,274 at the moment? This is a blatant attempt to stay under the radar.

You need to use critical thinking.  The crypto community is incredibly naive (the growth of coins like XRP and TRX attest this perfectly).

I see it constantly where die hard fans fade into cognitive dissonance justifying coin dumps.

My favourites include ;

'They needed the funds to build the Mainnet/MVP'
'It's for marketing'
'Oh that's just reading the supply incorrectly from the wrong source'
'They needed to increase supply for an upcoming listing on a new market.  It's just for liquidity'

"I believe Calvin Arye, Jihan, Roger, Craig, they all have the capabilities to crash BTC if they want. But what they need is to synchronize the timing together and make it really reeeeeally hurt, coupled by bitcoin.com and bitmain mining pools switching sides. The strategy to ensure BCH goes #1 is to get hashrates across from BTC to BCH. The key is to do I at the beginning of a difficulty rise, cut BTC hashrates by half and start dumping BTC for BCH in multiple exchange, it's downhill for BTC from there.

No transactions go across in BTC if mining power switches side at the start of a new difficulty change, miners continue to cascade across to BCH as BTC is being dumped for BCH. Remember, BTC is only money if transactions can continue to happen, during this flipping period, BTC is not money anymore, it's just a bunch of database that shows you how much you have in your screen.  Let say after 2 hours they manage to mine a BTC block with less miners on their side, so what? You have only mined 1mb of blocks, but there are another 2015 blocks to go and your mempool has already maxed. Even if you managed to mine 2016 blocks after 2 months and lower difficulty, The difficulty only goes down a small portion compared to the hashrates you lose.

So you look at Uber and see random people playing a game on a cellphone. Would a random person playing a game be playing it at 3 AM? Certainly not. Would a random person playing a game arrive where you are in a timely manner and would know how to get to where you need to go? Of course not. After all they are not taxis, they are not professionals who were screened and trained to go this job. And thus your natural conclusion would be that Uber is some weird and useless fad.

Logical reasoning cannot be changed just because you decide to look at the problem from a different perspective. 1+1 is still 2 even of you look at it from a different paradigm. My point is very simple. Bitcoin folks have an identity crisis. Some see it as a scarce resource that has value which would mean the price would go up over time (similar to gold). Some see it as a new medium of exchange that will replace our financial system. I'm here to say it cannot logically be both. There is a reason why gold stopped being used as a currency.

bitcointalk.org has always accepted only BTC, never with any intermediary, and while taxes are very time-consuming because you have to account for *every* transaction, I wouldn't call it ""damn near impossible"".

----

On changing the tax laws, IMO:

* Taxation is theft, and should ideally be eliminated.
* If that is impossible, it'd be better to replace income tax with just a federal sales tax, property tax, a tax directly on state governments, or pretty much anything other than income tax.
* If income tax can't be eliminated, I don't think that the often-talked-about idea of classifying Bitcoin as a foreign currency would help much, and may hurt. If you do many transactions, you'd probably still go over the yearly limit and have to do all of these calculations as before, and there is no reduced long-term capital gains rate on foreign currency.
* The current property-like treatment seems to be the only thing which makes sense in the overall US income-tax framework. I've sometimes thought that replacing the property treatment with a unique use tax (ie. you'd pay a *fixed* percentage, regardless of cost basis, every time you buy something with BTC or sell BTC) might make some sense because it'd make calculation way easier, but it'd often result in either far higher or far lower tax paid compared to the property treatment, so it probably won't happen, and if it did then not everyone would be happy.",1526683794

"You don't have to make the cap any smaller to keep the reward rate the same over time.  You haven't even answered the most basic question of how an exponentially decreasing reward schedule is more egalitarian than just keeping it the same until the cap is hit. 

Exponentially decreasing rewards means people have exponentially smaller opportunity to mine bitcoin if they come later than earlier, not determined by risk or anything other than the fact the protocol exponentially decreases reward over time. That's by definition ensuring and inequal opportunity.

People are just saying ""egalitarian"" because it sounds cool and fair without any interest in what the word would actually mean in context.

You can't just say ""its egalitarian, if you don't get it I don't have time to explain it to you"" as if that somehow makes any kind of point. If what you really mean is ""I can't answer the most basic questions to defend the idea that this is somehow egalitarian"" then say that, rather than high horsing pretending you're actually making good points but I'm too dumb to get them.

&gt;Bitcoin's 21 million cap is one of it's most attractive features and is part of what makes it so egalitarian

"This point of view is mostly held by people who have no experience in big open source development projects. The role of a maintainer in such projects is closer to a janitor than an actual omnipotent leader. They do have powers and there are a lot of implicit and explicit rules that they have to follow when using them.

If they act without a demonstrable approval of other contributors (people posting pull requests, reviewing code, testing features, etc.) these contributors will stop participating and if the maintainers actions are really seriously against this principle the contributors who care about the project will fork away. Based on Github statistics that's not what is happening, new contributors keep joining the project regularly and decisions regarding what gets committed are discussed in detail and in public from my experience.

If you want an example of what dissension among developers in open source projects can give I suggest that you read about [OpenWRT and LEDE](https://openwrt.org/about). For them the ""fork"" had a rather positive effect in the end... they merged again ;)

For Bitcoin, it is undeniable that there is currently a de facto reference client, it is Bitcoin Core and this situation happened over years of development/collaboration. Contributors decided that their efforts were better focused by working on this project instead of starting their own or forking it (some still decided to create their own client on the same network and they have their own implementations/differences but they do follow the lead of the largest community of developers when it comes to the protocol consensus).

Nobody coerced these contributors to work this way, the whole process is open (discussions and development). They come from various backgrouns, work for various companies (many are unemployed/self-employed, many try to stay anonymous too). They are most likely clever enough to witness the collaborative efforts I have described above and decided that there is no actual dictatorship in place when it is time to commit changes and that working on a consensus based protocol requires such collaboration.

The network consensus that is obtained by people running the software is preceded by a form of social consensus among the developers of each client implementation, it's reached by discussion and actual code creation (usually in the reverse order, create code, prove it's worth to the community, it might get committed if enough contributors find it useful and secure). Breaking this form of social consensus among developers jeopardize the project cohesion and maintainers have no interest in doing this on purpose.",1526682990

"&gt; I have lots of good answers -- you're looking at it all wrong. it's not about ""decentralized"".

I never said it is. However without decentralization, what does ""trustless"" even mean? And the point that I did actually make - without a trustless system, whatever system you want to make could be run more cheaply by the central authority with a dirt cheap API on top of it.

&gt;   there are other benefits. the financial incentives are based on increases in efficiencies interally -- the real place for blockchain is in B2B functionality, specifically to infrastructure.

The best interpretation I can come up with on this statement is that the increase in efficiency due to using a blockchain will be great enough that none of the parties involved will want to cheat or bend the rules. That seems highly unlikely - again there is an authority somewhere controlling the data/rules of the blockchain. It would be cheaper to setup that authority as an industry body running the simple and cheap system.

&gt; the reality is that people may not LIKE how it's going to be used by business. I can see people screaming ""NO YOU'RE USING IT WRONG!"" but - there's no such thing. It's tech, you apply it as you need it.

Sure people can do whatever they want. It doesn't mean all ideas are good.

&gt; I'm giving you a good answer. I've sat in many board rooms talking about these exact things with people who have the money and the power to implement them.

Having money and power doesn't guarantee anything when it comes to humanity-level breakthroughs like relativity, the internet, and now trustless information exchange. Blockchains existed many years before Satoshi packaged them up into an actual trustless system with the name Bitcoin. Why didn't all these rich and powerful people use blockchain then?

&gt; As I said - look into Hyperledger Fabric, look into the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, look into hashchains, and other new protocols.

I will do this.

&gt; no one in the business world wants ""crypto"". (except financial firms) - but blockchain when utilized for things like HIPPA compliance and legal chain of custody - not to mention the idea that multiple companies could ""speak"" across their ERP systems with the same language. 

No one wants ""servers"" or ""switches"" or ""BGP"". It does not matter. Those are fundamental parts of what makes the internet work.

No one wants a ""Theory of General Relativity"". It does not matter. GPS would never have been conceived without it.

No one wants ""internal combustion engines"", etc. ad infinitum. We want the applications that are made possible by these amazing breakthroughs. ""crypto"", as you summarize it, is the breakthrough that enables the applications.

&gt; I recommend you do some research regarding this and stop listening to zealotry around cryptocurrency.

I have done quite a bit of research and my conclusion is that Bitcoin works with logic and requires no zealotry. ""Blockchain"" without underlying incentives is what requires zealotry.

As I said before, I am open to being wrong. I will read up on your topics and see if there are already well-formed underlying incentives that allow trustless information exchange.

"Oh my I'm not going to be able to compete with you on text volume! You give a lot of detail, and I don't see any detail that I disagree with, but I don’t believe much of the detail provided makes the case for wasted energy. I'm going to try my best to present why the energy consumed by the bitcoin network is useful and not wasted, and how soon the power consumption will be very acceptable.

### Why does the bitcoin network use so much electricity?

Electricity consumption by the bitcoin network is used to secure the network. Less power consumption = less security. The reason for this is that for an attacker to rewrite the blockchain they will have to overpower the network \(so called 51&amp;#37; attack\), and if the network has more power than anyone or any group of governments can muster, then the network is more secure than the case where a corporation or government \*could\* overpower the network. I don’t think anyone doubts this, but I do believe many believe that too much electricity is used and that it would be acceptable to reduce the network security in order to reduce electricity consumption. I do not agree with that statement but it turns out we won’t need to make that trade\-off in the very near future. But, I’m getting ahead of myself.

### Does the bitcoin network use “too much” electricity?

A socialist government might come to that conclusion. A fair government would say that everyone should use electricity in proportion to what they are willing to pay for it. For example, do christmas lights use too much energy \([https://phys.org/news/2015\-12\-christmas\-energy\-entire\-countries.html](https://phys.org/news/2015-12-christmas-energy-entire-countries.html)\)? Maybe. Who is in charge of deciding what use of electricity is “good” and what is “bad?” The truth is that a free and open market should decide. If you don’t get it… I don’t have the time to try to convince you. I am sorry.

### Is the bitcoin network’s electricity consumption growing so fast that it is out of control?

No. The electricity consumption *is* controlled. Hear me out. It is useful to estimate how much energy is used by the network in the following way. The controlling feedback loop that increases or decreases the bitcoin’s mining power is right now the coinbase reward because it is a miner's primary source of revenue. If the value in $ of the coinbase reward \(awarded every 10 minutes on average\) goes up, miner’s revenue goes up and they are incentivized to add hashing power. Price of BTC goes up, average mining power goes up. What happens if too much hashing power is added to the network? The most inefficient miners find that they are spending more on electricity than they are receiving in revenue, so they shut their inefficient rigs down which reduces the network hashing power. Price of BTC goes down, average mining power goes down. Thus, the hashing power is controlled by the price of bitcoin compared to the price of electricity and computers. The hashing power is not “going up forever,” but it will go up when the price of 12.5 BTC goes up, and it will go down when the price of 12.5 BTC goes down. \(Ordering new rigs and facilities takes time, and the effect may lag the cause by 4 to 10 months\). Fun fact: note that on average it does not matter how efficient a mining rig is. If rigs are made more efficient on average, you will see more hashes/second but *you will not see a difference in how much money is spent on electricity,* in the long run. Understanding why this observation is true is crucial to understanding what drives electricity use in the bitcoin network.

### Is too much electricity used by the network today on a per-transaction basis?

Absolutely. This is the reason that many folks are sounding alarm bells. What they fail to see is that with layer 2 networks like Lightning, the number of transactions per 10 minutes can be increased by a factor of 10\^6, 10\^9 or more without increasing the required hashing power. How is that possible? You’ll need to understand the basics of Lightning, but the short answer is that most on\-chain transactions will end up consisting of Lightning’s opening and closing of channels \(which are on\-chain transactions themselves\) and all of the millions of off\-chain transactions inside the Lightning channels can scale almost indefinitely \(not quite\) without affecting the hashing power. 

### So the amount of electricity used will remain the same while the transaction volume can scale to millions or billions of transactions per second?

Yes. In essence, the Lightning network \(or similar\) will increase the capacity of the transaction network by 6 to 10 orders of magnitude, while the hashing power will not be affected except through the second order effect of the increasing price of BTC \(as described in the paragraphs above, “Price of BTC goes up, average mining power goes up.”\).

### Tell me again why ASICs and FinFET fabric chips matter when calculating how much money will be spent on electricity for mining now and in the future?

They don’t matter. At all. I’m not sure how to interpret arguments that include numbers like the as\-of\-today hashrate of computers or the as\-of\-today rate of increase in electricity usage. Those numbers may very well be right yet it has no material effect on where the mining power is headed over the next several years. If the miners double their revenue because of {insert your reason here it does not matter} then they will use some of that excess revenue to buy more rigs and electricity which increases the hash rate which increases the difficulty level which “re\-balances” the mining network to where it was before the doubling of the revenue. If a new rig comes out that produces 10x the hashes with 50&amp;#37; of the electricity, so what it does not change my calculation: If the miners are making a large profit they will increase their hashrate. If the miners are losing money they will decrease their hashrate by retiring their older rigs. It is a simple control loop that is ultimately driven by economics, not by technology.

"Last year I toyed with the idea of opening a crypto business that dealt only with crypto. It took me a lot of work but I was able to implement a system where QuickBooks could do my accounting properly in USD. At the end of the year, I could figure the rest with Bitcoin.tax. Took a couple weekends to figure out the setup but it's possible.

Setup a WordPress site with WooCommerce and create your offerings sold in USD. Integrate WooCommerece with GoURL.io as your crypto processor to accept crypto (BTC is set based on your USD price and market rate of BTC/USD). Then, use a tool called OpenSaaS that integrates directly with WooCommerce and QuickBooks. OpenSaaS will sync your sales on your site daily in dollar figures based on market rate.

The great thing about GoURL is that they will send the payments directly to your wallet. So if you set up an Exodus wallet, you'll get paid very quickly. Of course they take their cut, but it's not that bad.

the reality is that people may not LIKE how it's going to be used by business.  I can see people screaming ""NO YOU'RE USING IT WRONG!""  but - there's no such thing.   It's tech, you apply it as you need it.

I'm giving you a good answer.  I've sat in many board rooms talking about these exact things with people who have the money and the power to implement them.   As I said - look into Hyperledger Fabric, look into the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, look into hashchains, and other new protocols.

"Fair response. You are mostly likely right at most/all of your points, I understand from a pragmatic point of view I could agree that bitcoin may end up making a much smaller impact on the financial/governing systems then most would like to believe. I agree that for a lot of people counter party risk may be a better trade-off then personal responsibility for their full financial control of assets. Realistically lots of people will save their keys in an unsafe way, get hacked or even give them away willingly on scam sites and many other ways to lose money. And yes nobody is going to stop anyone from creating any form governance including inflationary currency, centralized currency, fractionally-backed currency, and a million and one other systems of governance. And of course the tech isn't where the tech is can't come close to being able to do everything the current system can do. So I agree with you that there are lots of risks/ issues with crypto. However to me I don't see these issues and being problems that are not solvable. Previously creating digital scarcity is impossible, now its not. Because there are draw-backs such as insurance and protection for consumers doesn't mean its permanent. With many projects all working on different application and creating inter-operability with many protocols I believe we can create a system that not only can do almost everything the currents system can, but even more than we can comprehend. Technology moves quickly and non-linearly. To me the bigger risk isn't Technical, its is Social. People are easily lead the wrong way and manipulated; now we have the opportunity to choose what form of world we live in by the forms of governance models we choose to adopt. The majority of people don't even know what money is, let alone know what the pros/cons/tradeoffs of different ways of organizing society. From a technical perspective I think the sky is the limit with what we can create; from a psychological/historical perspective, its likely the same cycles will repeat and not much will change. I'm always going to lean towards taking the optimistic, best case scenario option; even though the more realistic/pessimistic is probably more likely to happen. Because it is possible, it may be unlikely but the future is up to us to create if we choose to, most the best case and worst case scenario are all within the realm of possibility, so I choose to stick to the principles and values I truly believe in. However I understand your views and where you're coming from as well.",1526679599

If you have a couple of grand each month available, it's easy to lose a few hundred and to be able to pay for rent, food and a nice vacation the same month.

What you may loose in a month without barely taking notice can be an other persons saving of months or years. Don't be that ignorant.

One of the great things about this whole crypto field is that finally smart underdogs have a chance to push their own luck.
Trading at a profit was never in reach for people with a low income. Stockmarket is out of reach for those people. Fees and attached costs are so high that it is nearly impossible to get a food in the door. If your leverage is too low, you'll never be able to even hit the trading fee it costs you. If you don't have enough money right from the start, your chances for trading are at zero.

This is a change in paradigms which is happening, right there with crypto. See, Lambos (add down vote here) are stupid, they costs a lot and you have to stop if there is a pebble on the road.

Here is the fundamental mental rearrangement I hope you will see. Bitcoin is not an application of blockchain. Bitcoin is the combination of blockchain and financial incentives that ***together*** are trustless / permissionless. 

Blockchain alone cannot survive in an adversarial environment. When there are 2+ people and valuable data involved, you have to assume an adversarial environment.

In other words, all the blockchain solutions you see that are not built with an underlying financial consensus mechanism will have a central authority built into them somewhere.

"I am indeed a scientist. And while I do not work exactly on climate science, I most definitely have dedicated my life to improving the world, at personal sacrifice of income and recreational time. But this is irrelevant because ideas stand on their own merit.

I have extensively discussed the calculations behind the above claims with my colleagues who work on carbon fixation. 

The inspiration for this post is a few beliefs I've begun noticing among these colleagues regarding Bitcoin. Specifically regarding the energy use, they feel mining should be banned. And they are correct: bitcoin is the very incarnation of a dystopia where an AI maximizes an algorithm at the expense of human civilization.

But so is every other industrial activity, from gold mining to cattle ranching. That is why these things are regulated - to prevent environment destruction. 

So, as hypothetical world dictator, what would you do? I suspect, as a financial conflict of interest, you would not support banning Bitcoin, as my colleagues suggest. Alternatively, you can take a completely hands off approach, which you presumptively scold me for, as it will freely worsen climate change.

Or, we can take a measured regulatory approach to ensure a carbon credit system includes the external costs of mining, as the other scientist here suggests. And I would indeed vote for this implementation. The problem is that Bitcoin is a globally decentralized industry, unlike all previous industries, and the external costs are globally distributed and slow to take place. Regulation requires global government cooperation.

"A lot of questions! 

&gt;What do you mean 'were supposed to' ? 

When satoshi created bitcoin, he had a roadmap of how many coins should be mined per given period.

&gt;the fact that BCH had kept BTC's algorithm is not a premine or a scam. 

BCH didnt keep BTC's algoritm, they implemented one that was easy to abuse for real, huge financial gain. 

BCH currently has 100,000 BTC mined more than BTC does. Why? Because the DAA was easy to abuse and allowed the miners to literally inflate the coins created by 10%. 

100,000 BTC * 1500 = 150,000,000 USD. The small group of miners that played the system (switching off mining, then when difficulty was very low again, starting mining en-masse) got rich from the cheating and the normal BCH users are paying for it. 

&gt;What does Jihan have to do with it? 
He's only one of the main BCH proponents and the largest miner in the world. 

Do you think Satoshi would say 'Yes, thats my vision!' if he'd hear that BCH had a system that would make BCH unusable for weeks, then mining a block every 30 seconds, leading to a huge inflation of his roadmap? Sure, we have the EDA now, but nobody seems to be willing to talk aabout the 150,000,000 USD theft by the miners, of which the largest one is Jihan. ",1526677623
"I posted a thread that didn't get much traction yesterday... There are two things that could happen when tether is created:

When someone buys USDT, they take their crypto (e.g. Bitcoin) and give it to the exchange who has to give it to tether.  The end user gets USDT in exchange for this.

So they either have to 

1) promptly sell that BTC for money

2) Sit on the BTC and use it to back the tether.

-Number 1-  is fine, but one has to question how they are unloading all of this BTC.  It could be they are doing what Mt Gox trustees are doing - selling it to the side market, probably wall street types who are building a fund.  They then have money to back the tether.  If they aren't selling to big funds, I have doubts about their ability to sell that level of cryptocurrency on the side market for cash.

-Number 2- is a problem if BTC, or whatever cryptos they hold continue to drop.  If they sold 2.3 billion worth of USDT for 2.3 billion worth of BTC, and BTC drops to $0.000001 tomorrow, those 2.3 billion USDT's are backed by $17 worth of bitcoin. When people go to cash out of their USDT, the buyback will lift the price somewhat, but there will likely be hundreds of millions in losses.

On the other hand, if they are doing this, and bitcoin goes to $50,000... now they have 11.5 billion dollars worth of bitcoin and owe 2.3 billion to USDT holders.  The price of tether isn't going up, so they get to pocket 8 billion when people take their USDT and buy back into the market.

It could also be a combination of both. I have my bets on choice number 1 though, and here is why:

Institutional investors will not want to enter in through the open market. Its not liquid enough for investing in large quantities. That will drive the price up, and they will be holding the risky bag at the top.  They want to get in during sell offs, which is essentially what tether creation is.

On top of that, USDT is not a US dollar.  In order to convert it back to US dollars, you'll have to do something like buy BTC and send it to GDAX/coinbase and sell it.  That means the institutions are guaranteeing themselves that they aren't holding the bag.  They're going to be the ones selling you the BTC when you try to cash out.  

If this is what is going on, its brilliant really.  The bad news is there will never be any institutional money flooding into the market.  The money flooding into the market will be people converting their USDT to crypto. The good news is that most institutional investors aren't they type to buy and flip... so they are likely doing this to get in for the long haul...",1526677611

Since April, there have been rumors in the narrow circle of large cryptocurrency investors that Rothschilds are developing several cryptocurrency projects.

"&gt; For one, the gold standard was not left for that reason lol. A bit ludicrous to think so. It was left so politicians could get access that juicy inflation funding with thinly veiled excuses like saving us from ourselves.

Wrong, and more importantly, conspiracy theory nonsense.  The gold standard was abandoned for exactly the reason I said, it made poor money and it took the great depression to finally force the world accept that fact and move on.

&gt; For two, we’ve never had a deflationary currency on the supply side. 

Irrelevant, because in real life there is no just ""supply side"", there is simply the aggregate of supply and demand and when taken together, we've very much had deflationary currency before: gold.  Because demand exceeded supply creating... deflation and leading to depressions.

&gt; Recessions cause people to hoard money, increasing its value. But that’s an effect not a cause. Don’t confuse the symptom for the disease.

Good money doesn't increase in value when hoarded, that's what makes it good money.  I'm not confusing anything, you're merely not grasping what's being said.

&gt; Gold, fiat currency, heck even bitcoin are all actually inflationary. In a half or full decade or so we’ll get to see the first effectively non-inflationary currency in history.

"What's going to happen (and what has happened already) is that there is going to be a set of large cap, and stable coins (e.g. BTC. ETH, LTC, etc).  These are vetted coins, working products, that are driven by real development. The price will stabilize and probably become viable as a consistent storage of wealth (i.e gold), or an inflation resistant currency.  They will go up with inflation, down with deflation.  Trading will be like trading on FOREX (not stocks). The bad news is that once we get there, it probably won't be a great money making vehicle.  We certainly aren't there yet though.

Then there will be the equivalent of penny stocks and junk bonds.  That is where you will have your BS coins, scams, and things people will pump and dump.  The two markets will likely be completely disconnected in the future, and the value of major cryptocurrencies won't go up and down in tandem with these scam coins.  There might be a diamond in the rough in this group, but most likely it will be one amongst thousands of crap.  

There will be swings in both markets, but the big cap market (BTC/ETH/etc) will be slow.  The junk market will have pump and dump swings, that are sharp and drastic.  

Not much money enters the penny stock market in today's world... so on our path to this future, I suspect most the money in ""shitcoins"" will drain out.  There won't be a hundred million dollars in some shitcoins we see today. Money will be lost here, as people move to coins with practical applications.  

So, the future is probably bright for the big guys, and anyone with any real promise or technology.  Everyone else will be drained, and it will probably happen quite suddenly.  ",1526676171

&gt; 58\. On November 26, 2009 (Thanksgiving Day), Ira Kleiman and Dave met at their father's home for an early dinner. He and Dave discussed Facebook's recent success and Ira asked Dave if he was working on anything interesting. Dave responded by telling Ira he was working on ""something bigger"" than Facebook, that he was ""creating his own money."" 
&gt; 59\. Ira asked Dave to clarify and jokingly asked if Dave was making counterfeit money. 
&gt; 60\. Dave responded by saying he was making ""digital money."" He then opened his wallet, took out a business card, flipped it over, drew a ""B"" with a line or two through it, and commented on how ""we"" were working on a logo. 
&gt; 61\.
&gt; Da\ve told Ira he was working with a relatively wealthy foreign man who owned some properties. Ira asked Dave why he didn't partner with this wealthy individual. Dave was silent, which Ira understood to be Dave's concession they were already partners.
&gt; 62\. On May 20, 2014, Ira shared this story with Craig via email. (Ex. 2). 
&gt; 63\. Craig responded that same day stating ""we did partner ;)"". ( Id. ). Craig then commented on the ""properties"" stating, inter alia , that he owned 550 acres. ( Id .). He then said, ""I will have to see what I can dig up. The old Bitcoin logo we did is no longer used. I have a copy."" ( Id .). Craig later provided Ira with a copy of this Bitcoin logo. ( Id. ). 
&gt; 64\. This independent verification that Dave was creating ""digital money"" with Craig in 2009, Craig's admissions that he and Dave were ""partners"" in this venture, part of the Satoshi team, and that they were mining bitcoin through W&amp;K, all lead to the inescapable conclusion that their collaboration in ""creating"" or ""mining"" bitcoin and intellectual property was continuous from 2009 until Dave's passing in 2013.

Some of the alts from dividends did over three hundred percent the last couple of months, so here you have a potential growth from some ""worthless"" dividends. If one in ten develops well, it does not matter if some other fail, there is an exquisite growth added to the original 3-6% (and of course you can sell the dull ones and strengthen the ones you like).

&gt;Effectively you are just beginning the same process that has happened before which is taking sound money and through trust in intermediaries

No matter what you are going to have to trust middlemen and other parties. Bitcoin doesn't eliminate the need for trust in most cases, it only reduces it. You can be certain your bitcoin is going to go where you send it and that it won't be copied ect, but you can't be certain that laptop you paid for in bitcoins will actually be working like the ebay ad claims. And if it's not you just lost money with no recourse, hence why some third party is generally needed to insure those transactions. Hell, unless you made your hardware from scratch or are able to audit the code of wallets you are effectively still trusting a third party with your bitcoin. But the difference is bitcoin wallets don't have insurance in the event of a heist.

&gt; the economic system changes nothing other than giving people a few decades of sound money until it co-opted and derivate products are created and lose its value.

If you're worried about derivatives of bitcoin being created it's way to late for that. For example on the stellar blockchain you can get IOU tokens for BTC and ETH. There are also several gold and USD backed tokens on ethereum, so it's pretty clear derivatives aren't going anywhere. But blockchain can make them way more trust worthy because, at least with tokens backed by digital assets, you could instantiate a smartcontract to secure that it is always truly backed by the asset. 


I'm just not convinced that vanilla bitcoin can 100% replace everything a bank does. And if it is possible ethereum has a huge head start but I guess that's not really point.",1526674239

"&gt; It would also be tricky though... If you put your money in the bank, who ""has"" that money? You? The bank? The people the bank lends it to? Their bank? The people their bank lends it to?

The banks, your bank and the bank that received ""funds"" (IOUs) from your bank.

90%+ of bank loans the funds just go to another bank, in those cases the bank doesn't actually give them any money, just a mark on the digital ledger that they now hold x dollars.

&gt;At least one textbook states that **when a loan is made by the commercial bank,** the bank is keeping only a fraction of central bank money as reserves and **the money supply expands by the size of the loan.**[3] This process is called ""deposit multiplication"". However, as explained below, bank loans are only rarely made in this way.

&gt;The proceeds of most bank loans are not in the form of currency. Banks typically make loans by accepting promissory notes in exchange for credits they make to the borrowers' deposit accounts.[17][18] Deposits created in this way are sometimes called derivative deposits and are part of the process of creation of money by commercial banks.[19] **Issuing loan proceeds in the form of paper currency and current coins is considered to be a weakness in internal control.**[20]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional-reserve_banking#Money_creation_process

You need to know what is meant by ""loan proceeds"" to understand what this really means.

&gt;loan proceeds - Under the terms of a loan agreement, net amount a lender gives to the borrower.

Basically that last line that I emphasized states that they don't like to issue loans for actual physical currency. If they did that, the whole system would collapse.

He can build miners for every coin, and understands the sector well enough that if a small country wants to run a crypto central bank on coin ABC, he can make it happen. Like an exchange, they could care less about which coin is most dominant, so long as people want to trade them.

In my opinion the answer is yes, he considers mining *any* coin to be short-term profit. I don't blame him for that, it's no different than any other business out there. You can bet your ass that he's hedging his bets, not going all-in on any coin.",1526672415

Who does someone that raise 15m on a ICO claim to not earn anything in Crypto? o.O,1526671291
"&gt;a gold backed bank could print more notes because people paid and settled debts in notes instead of gold. this doesn't happen with bitcoin where people pay and settle debts with the base unit of bitcoin.

There is absolutely nothing stopping a bitcoin ""bank"" (exchange) from settling debts in bitcoin promises rather than actual bitcoins. The very ability to do this is the cause of several failures and runs on bitcoin exchanges who have sold more promises of bitcoin than they have bitcoin. Most buying and selling of and with bitcoin is done in promise form.

Money creation and fractional reserve are two different things. You can run anything on a fractional reserve so long as its legal and you have people willing to participate in it. You have not described how Bitcoins ""fully reserved"" status somehow means you can't run a fractional reserve bank/exchange anymore than you could with gold or fiat.

&gt;these 'banks' can stray and run as fractionally reserved, but if there's a run on the bank the jig is up and it will die - bad acting bank or not, the system is still fully reserved is it not?

How is this different from any other fractional reserve? If more people try to withdraw more money than the bank holds in reserve then the bank will fail. There is still an underlying quantity of existent currency. There has to be some currency in existence to build a fractional reserve on top of it.

This all seems like a very roundabout way to describe something different, which is that fiat banks can create money by loaning it whereas bitcoin miners have to do proof of work, which is not the same thing as having a fractional reserve or not.

&gt;my point is simply that as volatile a new voluntary currency is, inflation/deflation/appreciation aside, bitcoin adoption seemed to be moving along a lot better in prior years where speculators looking to buy and hodl and get rich didn't seem to be nearly as prevalent

When the supply of bitcoin was much higher and the demand was much lower then it was much less deflationary. As supply decreased and demand rose, price started increasing, which drew in speculators which increased price which drew in more speculators.

The only way to avoid this volatility would be by reforming the protocol to allow supply elasticity. You can't simultaneously tell people they can get rich by buying up bitcoin and then selling it later and not cause speculative bubbles where a bunch of people try to buy, hold, then sell bitcoin to make a profit, causing speculative cycles of price spikes and crashes.

"This is the real recap. Everyone wants instant moon lambos but the stories coming out about crypto currency this entire year are nothing but mass adoption on the cusp.

Not to mention NONE of the crackdown that could have happened by governments has barely even been attempted (not that it would matter for the good, decentralized coins anyways).

"I don't have a problem, I have a challenge and that is to get the whole world denominating prices in Bitcoin Cash. Part of that challenge is making it easy to understand by standardizing on a single currency unit that integrates well with common understandings of currency while leaving the existing conventions when trading BCH unchanged. 

When I went to school, I was thought the decimal system and [billion was what we now call a trillion](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/explore/how-many-is-a-billion/) conventions change. 

When buying in bulk 4 decimal places is used,  like $0.1234.

Most accounting software can handle 6 decimal places for currency units. I don't know any accounting systems that can handle 8 decimal places for a currency unit. 

I think it is easier for a new currency to adapt to the world of many currencies than have Bitcoin Cash change the way currency systems denominate currency. 

I do know when I go to a supermarket to buy something  0.00000005 per unit is more easily confused with 0.0000005 per unit. 

I also know the supermarket would rather have a price displayed in a way it is easily understood Like 0.05 per unit. Which is not as easily confused with 0.50 per unit. 

at this time people don't care about more than say $0.01 worth of BCH which is 0.00001 BCH so stick with BCH for now,

When Future proofing to avoid the problem lets redefine the use of the unused decimals that people don't care about today. 0.00000**""000""**

It's not long until he sees the bigger picture and later clarifies. I won't be surprised if he looks deeper into Bitcoin Cash very soon, if he hasn't already done so or is probably reading this paragraph right now. Hi Woz!

"Every blockchain is practically isolated and can only deliver its services to those people who are using its coins/tokens. Right now we are seeing an explosion of new blockchain projects, each of which has its own functionality and problem it tries to fix. StorJ &amp; SiaCoin for example are building decentralized cloud-storage applications but can only be used by directly purchasing their respective tokens.

Now comes the Blocknet: its protocol allows isolated chains to communicate and interact with each other, making it possible to create dApps (decentralized Apps) using different blockchains. Such a dApp could look like this:

Purchase cloud-storing services with every coin/token you can imagine (but has to be supported by the Blocknet protocol - [right now around 70 - but much more being constantly tested and added]).

The only thing you will see on the app user-interface are the options of which service to buy. You choose your desired cloud-storage service and press the pay-button. Now you can choose your preferred coin/token for payment (Vertcoin, what else?). What you do not see:

By using the Blocknet interoperability protocol the dApp will automatically buy Sia/StorJ tokens for you to pay for the service of your choice which will make crypto-life much easier.

An even ""more complex"" example would be:

So once The Blocknet establishes erc20 integration it would be possible to build dApps from which to consume services like for example StorJ's cloud-storage directly while at the same time using (being logged in via) Digibyte's Digi-ID! And all you would need is Vertcoin to pay for it!

Maybe this article can help you understand better:

The need for interoperability: the last component of a trustless ecosystem

Feel free to ask questions or correct me in case I got something wrong. I am also still wrapping my head around all those new possibilities.

Companies like TenX, technologies like Lightning Network already making BTC a more reliable and trustworthy option for every-day transactions than fiat.  
Seeing how it already worked on a big scale e.g. in Greece or Africa.

More and more personal and shared experiences with every-day use of BTC.  
  
Those are just some of the indicators I trust more than any deceiving stat or number because they actually come from the real world and are impossible to be manipulated or misinterpreted.  
Oh talking of that - the fact that the price is being manipulated big-time for months now may just be the biggest hint that someone is mighty scared to lose his power.  
  
(I will add my personal most valuable reason to this, think of it what you want:  
BTC is the far more human option to our current money system. Everyone who digs into how banks run the world should be horrified and on his way out as fast as he can. Awareness about this is on the rise, as well as frustration about our current financial system and will eventually lead to people taking responsibility and looking for alternatives.

"&gt; Is it more that the algorithm adjusts only to the computing power, more hashing power equals harder algorithm, and less computational power equals easier algorithm like in the early days.?  

That's basically it, yes.  

&gt; The more people buy in with prices rising then the higher the price goes and the more computational power is needed to secure the transaction and find new Bitcoins  

No, that is not what's happening. There is no need for more security with a rising price. If there's a correlation, then it's because with a rising price it becomes more profitable to mine bitcoin, so it's more likely that new miners might come online. But then again your first point kicks in (difficulty adjustment).  
Hashrate follows price, essentially.

"Well, the vast majority of humans lived in poverty for millenia so I'm not exactly basing my economic theories on the wisdom of the ages.

I'm glad (really) that bitcoin is enabling you to have more human contact, but rest assured that no one on the other end of a transaction cares ""how much work and effort [you] personally have to put in to acquire the Satoshi that [you] spent."" And neither do you--when you buy bitcoin, you don't care whether the guy you're buying it from spent $3 on it years ago with pocket change or $15k on it by mortgaging a house he'd spent his life paying for.

It Seems very reasonable to me that as Bitcoin matures, they would WANT to keep their liquidity in BTC as they are likely selling their house to buy another, which is also more desirable in BTC, all for obvious reasons.

Right now, people see 'buying' bitcoin with fiat as the only way to get a hold of some.

Wait until the penny drops that you can sell your mcmansion for BTC and THAT is the way to get your mits on some instead of the bankster fiat on ramps.

That'll drive the price up. People exchanging fiat to BTC to buy houses and that BTC NEVER going back to an exchAnge for fiat, but onto the next house seller and onto the next etc.

Ultimately, most house sales become fiat showing in a bank ledger temporarily as holding place for value until it is exchanged for another house. This process is so much more convenient with BTC.",1526667960

"&gt; I'm not sure what you're trying to say with this. Any money supply is always ""fully reserved"" when you look only at the money that actually exists.

maybe to make this more analogous to the use, at M1 there are loans and the supply is larger in the US fractional system, but a bitcoin C1 would not have any fractionally created money at this bank/user level.  i don't believe an exchange or even further out, derivatives, can make bitcoin anything but fully reserved.

a gold backed bank could print more notes because people paid and settled debts in notes instead of gold.  this doesn't happen with bitcoin where people pay and settle debts with the base unit of bitcoin. 

&gt; If you look at anywhere claiming to accept bitcoin nearly all of them are accepting a promise from a 3rd party reserve rather than a blockchain transaction.

wouldn't this speak more to a lack of decentralization or peer to peer cash?  are these not simply all examples of trusting a pseudo-bank operating in a fully reserved system to itself operate fully reserved?  these 'banks' can stray and run as fractionally reserved, but if there's a run on the bank the jig is up and it will die - bad acting bank or not, the system is still fully reserved is it not?

&gt; At 10% deflation during the Great Depression people were already resorting to barter rather than spending deflationary currency. With Bitcoin people can just keep using fiat with no need to either resort to barter or start using bitcoin as currency.

i don't disagree.  my point is simply that as volatile a new voluntary currency is, inflation/deflation/appreciation aside, bitcoin adoption seemed to be moving along a lot better in prior years where speculators looking to buy and hodl and get rich didn't seem to be nearly as prevalent.

people seemed more interesting in both holding and using it then as should actually be done with a currency.

"lol... nah. Do you actually not know what it is? It’s an important factor when considering long term gains. Bitcoin halving means the rewarded bitcoin from mining one block is reduced by half. Less bitcoin mined per block means fewer supply being mined, which ideally leads to an increase in value.

Well, here's a video clearly showing that the concepts of ""dial tone"", ""receiver switch"", ""rotary dial"", etc were completely unknown. Yet the telephone became ubiquitous anyway. Everyone learned. It wasn't really that hard.

And bitcoin isn't that hard either. Telephone users didn't need to know how switching worked or what was inside their device. Similarly bitcoin users don't need to know what miners do nor all the software machinery inside their wallets.",1526667346
"&gt;A thought excercise: If bitcoin were to replace 15% of the liquid money supply (M3-M1) a bitcoin would be worth roughly 550k.

You could say this about any crypto. Why would goods and services somehow be locked into being represented by any one particular currency? Wealth exists independent of currency. If you burned every dollar in existence and wiped every dollar off every bank computer no wealth would be lost. If you doubled the amount of dollars in existence no wealth would be lost.

you described an immutable ledgers value in terms of utility, not scarcity. immutable ledgers are not scarce, we can make as many of them as we want.

&gt;That's exactly how economics works though. The concept of scarcity as it relates to human consumption literally comes from a 1932 economics paper.

Artificial scarcity is not the same thing as scarcity. 

Increasing or decreasing the number of tokens doesn't directly increase or decrease the scarcity of anything else.

Trade tokens aren't scarce, especially not ones based on an open source software project that we can make infinite copies of.

Scarcity is not the goal of human economy, removing scarcity is. We want as little scarcity as possible. Unless you have a compelling reason how having fewer trade tokens than units of wealth to trade reduces scarcity then you're just arguing for your ability to profit from artificial scarcity, which is just rent seeking. no one has any incentive to make you rich for no reason.

If you think bitcoins are actually real wealth, not just a token, then simply convince every other bitcoiner to change the protocol to issue 10 trillion bitcoins per block and we can all be rich as kings and never have to work again.

&gt;True, but bitcoin is not a perfect economic substitute. If bitcoin provided literally no additional utility over cash, it would be a perfect substitute.

One thing has nothing to do with the other thing. You can effortlessly spin a node and still the overall performance of the system will be terrible if not centralized in a few hubs.

&gt; That's why a healthy fee market for on-chain transactions is necessary and the BTC community understands this.

What prevents it in BCH? You just need to get high volume of transactions going on. Actually, not really unique Tx as in ""one person one Tx"", but *data* paying fees.

This mindset works. It increases your spending power.

The 'price' is short hand for the price in dollars, nothing more, nothing less.

I prefer the price to be more accurate. A USD would cost me 12,000 Satoshi at the moment because that may be the place I need to make the purchase.

However if I am in Zimabwe, my actual real cost in Satoshi moves down rapidly. 

Me personally? 

When I try to purchase a good or service in BTC, I pay what I think the item or service is worth to me in Satoshi and the seller of the good or service tells me what they want and we actually talk about it like humans have done for millenia. As in, how much work and effort do I personally have to put in to acquire the Satoshi that I spent, back?

Vice versa for the seller. What's it worth to them, like really, not just some arbitrary number based on some fiat currency from the other side of the planet representing an evil empire that bitcoin promises to end.

This is how I learned about what bitcoin is, I started trading first and all knowledge I have about bitcoin at the moment came as consequence of trading. 

It didn't take long to understand that trading is not for me, but the knowledge I  gained about Bitcoin, allowed me to understand how powerful and disruptive it is.

"Bitstamp is starting to ask some pretty spooky questions. I only recently filled in the KYC questionnaire.

I have been a loyal customer of theirs for years. Suddenly the KYC questionnaire pops up and I'm thinking ""fine, I'll fill that in, too"". This is bearing in mind I am fully verified. They have my passport, proof of address. You would think that would be enough.

Then they suddenly ask where my bitcoin originate \(mining\), how I heard about bitcoin, how much I am planning to withdraw, how I am planning to use my bitcoin. 

So I'm still thinking ""fine, I understand they are getting regulated up the wazoo and need to cover their asses against money laundering"". I tried my best to answer accurately, but honestly, it was mostly guess work.

But that wasn't enough either. Now they are asking for proof of purchase of my mining equipment. Like, what? 

So I resisted a bit and asked them if they can at least promise me that it will be enough information once I provide them an invoice for the miner \(no idea if I will even find it\). I also asked them what the consequences are, if I do not provide the information. They just ignored that question in their next communication.

Along with their messages, they keep saying ""you are welcome to provide additional \[insert ridiculously private and personal information about wallets and transactions\] and any other information"" without specifying exactly what they need and how much of it. So I just simply won't know when this process ends? That is nuts! Nobody has ever asked this much information of me in such a bizarre manner.

ON TOP OF THAT they have now asked me to 'elaborate' on 3 extremely specific transactions I made. To specific addresses. 

Like, how on earth am I supposed to know what that was for? I interact with the bitcoin ecosystem everywhere, like, some random number strings on blockchain don't tell me why I made some random transaction and it's not like I keep a spreadsheet with them in it.

"If you want to save space making an abbreviation why not use BCH?

Amway, I tend to agree with the poster above you.  The more one delves into the history which caused the split, the more one sees things for what they are.  The conclusion I personally came away with is that both Bitcoin core and Bitcoin cash are Bitcoin. 

However which of the two is most alighted to the original goals and system of Bitcoin, well I come to the conclusion that it's Bitcoin cash. 

Anyone can take the time to research the history, it's incredibly important to understand why the split took place and all the nasty politics which Core and friends used in the 3years leading up to the event. ",1526666359
"&gt;certainly, but the chain and wallets still force a fully reserved system. a monetary equivalent of ""C0"" money supply is purely a fully reserved system. 

I'm not sure what you're trying to say with this. Any money supply is always ""fully reserved"" when you look only at the money that actually exists.

people are already happy to accept non-blockchain ""bitcoins"" as perfect substitutes for bitcoin. Look at how many people are holding and spending ""bitcoins"" that are in fact just a promise by Coinbase or bitpay to give bitcoin on request. If you look at anywhere claiming to accept bitcoin nearly all of them are accepting a promise from a 3rd party reserve rather than a blockchain transaction.

The only distinction in this case would be whether its a government fractional reserve on a government currency or a market fractional reserve on a market currency. Government are the only ones with the power to stop people running fractional reserves.

&gt;but it doesn't need perfectly flat appreciation to be adopted for currency either

It doesn't, but it certainly helps if its not more than 10% annual inflation/deflation. 10% inflation/deflation a week is far too much to be tolerable in a currency you actually use for cashflow, when there are far more stable alternatives available.

At 10% deflation during the Great Depression people were already resorting to barter rather than spending precious currency. With Bitcoin people can just keep using fiat with no need to either resort to barter or start using bitcoin as currency.

Any currency supply that's just on a predetermined schedule with no ability to react to market changes is going to find itself over/under supplied. Gold and cowry both had long inflationary (oversupply) and deflationary (undersupply) periods despite the fact that the supply adjusted to demand, because supply wasn't perfectly elastic. 

Bitcoin has no elasticity outside of 2 weeks. This doubles down on the volatility on both ends. When bitcoin demand grows, supply can't grow and price will shoot up. When bitcoin demand falls, supply can't fall and the price will crash. It's also guaranteed to become under-supplied unless the global demand for currency starts shrinking at the same rate as its supply.  

Requiring exponentially decreasing adoption growth for a currency to maintain a stable price is not a good feature in a currency you want to see go from 0% adoption to 100%.

How quickly can the country obtain a sizable portion of that stable fiat currency to distribute to their citizens? How quickly can a country create a new currency?

"Then you better start saving a bit more money. I've published some statistics about the ""stress test"" back then, check my submission history if you are interested.

The cheapest 8mb block back then had 200$ tx fee, the most expensive one was 1700$. In total 61.000$ transaction fees were spread about 297 8MB blocks. And the first 8MB block wasn't mined instantly, so you need more than just money for one single 32mb block, but probably more like transactions to fill 3 blocks to make sure you get one full one.

And if you are unlucky, pools that have a limit set to 16mb or 8mb for example find the first blocks.

At the end you will achieve only 2 things: you will waste a shitload of money, and you will only feed the bch trolls that will instantly wank off and annoy every btc supporter with their new statistics. who else will care as long as we haven't even filled 8mb blocks since the stress test?

The value is unstable, it’s confusing to normal users, people earn fiat and pay taxes in fiat, energy use is outrageous, its controlled by a 100 whales, can be manipulated by whales (just look at trust liquidating mt goax coins), wallets have been hacked on multiple occasions, new cryptos are created everyday, it feels like a ponzi scheme.

Signaling support for BIPs is a way for a centralized development team to decide what to implement.

"Bitcoin mining is real and legit, you used to be able to do it at home, but nowdays it requires you buy some pretty expensive hardware, and as it continually becomes more difficult to do you have to keep investing more and more in hardware and electricity.  It really is now beyond the reach of most individuals.
Pools are also real and are operated as a way for individuals to group individual hardware together to improve changes of getting a payout.

When someone operates the hardware for you, this is often called a 'mining contract', basically the operator takes your money and uses it to invest in hardware and electricity, often in a place like Iceland where energy is cheap, and you get a share of the profits.  There can be referal bonusses for bringing in new people.

The killer for me is 
&gt; They say that it is more stable than buying Bitcoin, which can fluctuate in price and cause you to lose money.

You are paying money ($3,900) to buy the right to earn Bitcoin, which is then converted back to $, so if the Bitcoin price falls, you might not get the value back.  They either really dont know what they are talking about, or they are hard selling.

However the 'hard sell' and the concept of MLM does sound very concerning, also the lack of ability to access accounts, need for VPNs all sounds like utter BS to me.  If you arent comfortable, your instincts are probably right.

Old school home mining sounds great and reminds me of the good old times, but i doubt that we will go back to the old days where we mined with gpus on btc. Asics are not going to consume less energybor be less loud just because the difficulty will be lower. 

the big question is how miners will drop support for btc when they do. If the majority of the miners just switch to BCH for example in one go right after the difficulty adjustment like they did for ""fun"" last year for a couple of hours, the remaining miners will struggle to even find a single block in a reasonable time frame that doesn't turn the market into a panic sell nightmare. As much as I would love this solution as payback to the big players who steered btc onto this dead end road, this will not happen.

If miners switch in a coordinated way by reducing hash power over a time frame of a couple of months so difficulty can adjust accordingly, it would probably totally be possible to keep btc operational without much consequences. The question will be how decentralized the remaining hash power will be distributed. I wouldn't be surprised if a few farms from big investors are just waiting for this day to take a big bite of the remaining cake afterwards. ",1526664881

"&gt; The inherent value being talked about was in an economic sense, as opposed to speculative value, not just a general sense of value.

Right, and economic value is created when parties save time on transactions, which was the entire point of my story. 

&gt;Then the price of bitcoin is massively inflated above the inherent value of the utility of the technology.

Why though? The current value of people that are able to maintain ledgers with acceptable accuracy FAR outstrip bitcoins value. 

A thought excercise: If bitcoin were to replace 15% of the liquid money supply (M3-M1) a bitcoin would be worth roughly 550k. 

It's absolutely not far fetched to think that sometime in the future, 15% of american business could decide they don't want an accountant on their payroll. 

&gt;People aren't paying so much for bitcoin because of the economic utility of a medium of exchange, they're paying based on speculation on artificial scarcity, which is not the utility of the technology.

That's exactly how economics works though. [The concept of scarcity as it relates to human consumption literally comes from a 1932 economics paper.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarcity)

People have been paying for things they perceived as scarce since before Wealth of Nations was written. Knowing the supply limit would only change that if difficulty of acquiring coins was constant. In fact, this is one of the main reasons why difficulty scaling was so brilliant in the first place. It's effectively a monetary mechanism to prevent deflationary investor behavior. 

&gt;A lumberjack isn't going to pay $10,000 for an axe if they can get an axe that cuts trees just as good for $100.

Correct, but would they pay $10k for a machine that could cut down trees thousands of miles away that could also guarantee that the machine was working without them even looking at it? 

Absolutely. 

&gt;In economics there are basically no recorded instances where something with perfect economic substitutes can be thousands of times more expensive than its substitutes.

True, but bitcoin is not a perfect economic substitute. If bitcoin provided literally no additional utility over cash, it would be a perfect substitute. 

Unfortunately, you can't teleport cash across the world yet, and even if you could, you'd have no way of knowing if the receiving party actually got it unless they could teleport messages back to you. ",1526663530

"&gt; So having too many LN ""hub"" nodes is suddenly a problem because they are too cheap to run and anyone can do this? What happened to the ""LN is going to be centralized around a few big hubs"" narrative that is pushed so hard by the BCH people?

i don't think i'm being inconsistent at all.  it's relatively easy to see how this is all going to evolve.  first off, it IS easy for any Tom, Dick &amp; Harry to spin up a server at essentially no cost to skim fees; and this includes banks.  right now, small fry are chipping away at stealing miner fees but in the long run, the banks can enter the race and become large LN hubs.  yes, small fry will then have more trouble but in aggregate, this doesn't change the fact that none of these LN hubs are doing the hard work of setting up PoW mines that makes Bitcoin's mainchain layer security unique.

&gt;That's why a healthy fee market for on-chain transactions is necessary and the BTC community understands this. 

they don't understand that it's way too early to be crippling onchain scaling and user/merchant adoption.  the evidence being the mass bankruptcy of hundreds of BTC accepting merchants the past few years as fees have skyrocketed.  the fee mkt is a stupid idea at this time.",1526662828

"Can't disagree on any of this but I just think it is part of the learning process we undergo as a global culture. Crypto-currencies are historically totally new to human society with an unmeasurable potencial. This mixture is BOUND to cause a whole ton of misunderstanding, abuse, failure, resistance and struggle over controlling it.  
I believe that it is not our job to keep people from getting scammed or making mistakes in general. We need those to learn and adapt. People need time to learn how to make reasonable decisions regarding such a new technology.  
The lesson with all the ICO scam is not ""crypto-currencies are bad"" but ""don't make unreasonable decisions"". People will get that in the end but unlike someone who's really diving into the topic they might need more time, more mistakes and more positive examples to look up to.  
They might be scared off for months or years but in the mean-time the technology will advance and spread, smart people will create smart ways to make cryptos easy-to-use and it will not be long until they get in contact with the topic again. This time with less traps to step into.  
  
Sometimes the most influencial thing you can do is to just forget about everyone who doesn't get it at the moment. Keep diving in for yourself, keep thinking and sharing thoughts with people who are open for discussion but don't waste your time on people who are not ready for it.

When you have your Cheif Strategic Officer saying some shit like that, then yeah, Bitcoin isn't about banking the unbanked anymore. 

Sure, Bitcoin is designed with game theory in mind, and that people are naturally greedy. I don't think Satoshi imagined that Bitcoin would be ruined enough for this whole fuckin' shitcoin market to pop up based on speculation and gambling. Think if BTC still has low fees and merchant adoption was still on the incline, instead of decreasing, like Steam and Microsoft actively dropping support. It will be a while until companies like this accept ANY form of crypto. Thanks Blockstream. BTC would actually still be king and useful as a currency and not used primarily as a trading pair. 

Yes, Bitcoin won't replace governments and banks, but you can sure as hell say that it takes power away from them. So much for their centrally planned monetary policy.

"**Cross subsidization**

Cross subsidization is the practice of charging higher prices to one group of consumers to subsidize lower prices for another group. State trading enterprises with monopoly control over marketing agricultural exports are sometimes alleged to cross subsidize, but lack of transparency in their operations makes it difficult, if not impossible, to determine if that is the case.

Suppose Alex goes to dinner with two of his friends, Leo and Lin. Alex's meal costs $25, Lin's meal costs $20, and Leo's meal costs $15.

Assuming Bitcoin ever gets put into an ETF, the hoarding effect will drive up price but it won’t eliminate use because Bitcoin can still continue to be used in extremely fractional amounts with no drop off in efficiency (assuming the network doesn’t clog)

This is BS. If you have $164k of some asset that’s as easy to send as email, there is nothing stopping you from being able to spend little bits here and there. If the value keeps going up, the amount you end up shaving off with each purchase becomes less and less.

"&gt;In previous years, Bitcoin was about social change. In previous years, people had a vision for banking the poorest in the world, freeing them from corrupt governments, and transfer of wealth through a decentralized, on-chain bitcoin.

I've been in bitcoin for about 4 years, and that is not what it's about. It was designed with the game theory that people are greedy as fuck so they will act somewhat rationally and not want to lose money for stupid reasons. Rules such as for spamming the network costing transaction fees, or using the longest chain to make sure crappy forks don't become the main chain are 100% about profit. It wouldn't work otherwise. 

Most people including myself, came for the technology but stayed for the money.

There is this weird neo-libertarian  idea in the community that bitcoin will destroy banks and governments or that they will get #REKT and that's the point of bitcoin. This is not the point, in fact banks and governments have just as much right to participate and make profit like everyone else. The point was to create an antifragile new money and value transfer system that protects individuals wealth from POTENTIAL bad actors that control the legacy system. There are many functions that banks and governments serve and that can't simply be replaced by digital cash or even smartcontracts. But the existence of an alternative insures that they will have a harder time acting badly. Bitcoin has created a new, more fair nash equilibrium between the powers that be and the people but it's not a direct assault on banks or governments.

"&gt;the little guy who needs to sell his BTC for fiat to break even on costs because they can't float it is losing out on the gains from a potential market recovery

Thats a ridiculous nonsensical argument. First of all, if you run a single 1000W miner, surely you ARE able to cover the electricity cost with fiat if you wanted to. A company with 10 of 1000's of miners, thats a different story, they DO need to sell BTC to pay the bills.

Secondly, if selling your BTC doesnt even cover your electricity cost, then you are not being profitable period. you can safely forget about recouping your investment and you would be better off unplugging the miner until the price recovers. Hanging on to mined BTC in hopes of price appreciation is completely identical to buying or hanging on to purchased BTC in hope of price appreciation. If you think BTC will go up, buy some. Dont invest in mining equipment or spend on electricity if that generates less BTC than your dollars would on an exchange. 

This kind of ""thinking"" IMO is the main reason why people are willing to pay ludicrous prices for miners. Ive seen it since the first asics where launched, people thinking they made a profit because their mined BTC went parabolic in value, and not realizing investing the same money in BTC directly would have usually earned them a high multiple of that. The reality is they lost on mining, as almost everyone paying retail prices for hardware has for almost the entire existence of asic miners, but people just fail to understand...

Philosophically I don’t know where you stand on that, and as modern western citizens it might no seem like a big deal, or even a very bad thing.

Not everything illegal is immoral.  Under repressive governments the value of being able to move your assets without the government seeing can’t be overstated.  

I can’t imagine how valuable bitcoin could have been to Jews in Nazi Germany or black marketers in the Soviet Union.

"Part of it is a matter of investment and institutional risk. 

If a little guy is going to build a system that requires X hours and $YYY per month in electricity and other misc maintenance costs they are going to have a harder time running the system and waiting out a potential return to profitability with a market recovery at a point where the system is making no or little money.

With someone with more well funded, either personally, through a small pool of investors, or something larger scale, they have the financial backing to wait it out, and potentially pick up good lightly used equipment on the cheap from little guys who are getting out because they can't afford to float an expensive electricity bill for a few months until the market recovers and they can convert to fiat at better rates. 


Think of it this way, the little guy who needs to sell his BTC for fiat to break even on costs because they can't float it is losing out on the gains from a potential market recovery. When the market recovers, if it does, and we are back at 10 or 15k prices in many months, the little guy is going to be at 0 btc because they have been selling to maintain, and the bigger guy is going to have held on and have a huge bump in liquidity that they can use to further expand their system. 

Personally, my system is small enough and I am in a good enough place that I can leave it running and accumulate BTC even if the market goes to complete shit for a few months. My goal is to accumulate BTC through the setup, I will deal with converting to fiat at a later point. But I would have some hard decisions to make if my financial security changed. I actually track the day of value of what I produce as well as the current value. If current value is less than the sum of day of values, then there is no way I am converting to fiat to cover costs, I am going to float it (unless I have reason to believe the market is never going to recover).

certainly, but the chain and wallets still force a fully reserved system.  a monetary equivalent of ""C0"" money supply is purely a fully reserved system.  i suppose a bunch of exchanges running fractions could really screw with the value/purchasing power nonetheless though.

&gt; If supply rose with demand then price wouldn't increase, it would be impossible to increase the price by speculation and so there'd be no incentive to buy just to speculate.

i suppose if you packed velocity and people willing to accept payment as perfectly matching newly minted supply you would not have any appreciation, but it doesn't need perfectly flat appreciation to be adopted for currency either.  it just needs to have a more modest amount than the massive gains by speculators.  ie. the US deflationary spiral during the depression didn't result in as large of swings but it still caused people to hoard money and for activity to diminish, while more modest levels of deflation in past history did not cause the economy to grind to a halt.

"Each Bitcoin ATM has its own policies.  As has been said, you can get a profile of ATMs near you here:

https://coinatmradar.com/ 

We recently used one for the first time in Keene, NH and the process was seamless, even for newbies like ourselves.  (We are even newbies when it comes to smart phones - just got one a few months ago.)    We used cash - fed the machine $20 bills.  The ATM tallied each added bill on the screen.  We used SMS verification which consisted of texting to the machine and receiving a text in return with a number code which we typed into the ATM.    This particular machine had these verification requirements:

$1-1500 per day with SMS
$1501-2999 per day with SMS+ID

So you would be able to buy only a fraction of a bitcoin, even with ID.

The way this particular machine works is to show its scanner a QR code of a BTC address belonging to the user.  I had printed the QR code to a paper wallet belonging to us, and held the paper bearing that QR code up to the scanner.

At that point the machine asked if we wanted a receipt, which we did.  Receipt was printed out and the bitcoin showed up in our wallet on the Blockchain.  By the time we arrived home (it was a two hour drive from home to the ATM, which is in a small news shop) it had received 22 confirmations.

i get that they are current ideologically opposed, but don't expect that to be an immutable absolute for all time.

my current view is that as LN remains complex and not widely adopted, that BTC has pegged success to it, and each month it doesn't deliver (well) on all its promises that BCH will just keep chooching along one step closer to a flippening.  this is also based on my speculation that BCH is actually being used for cash transfers and adoption growing at a faster rate for merchants/peers than BTC - although as far as i can tell there's no way to support that belief with evidence (?)",1526657111

"The inherent value being talked about was in an economic sense, as opposed to speculative value, not just a general sense of value.

&gt;Does a ledger in accounting have inherent value? Does having an easily dividable medium provide utility for the people using it? The answer is yes. Let's say I'm a lumberjack, and you're a cook.

Then the price of bitcoin is massively inflated above the inherent value of the utility of the technology.

People aren't paying so much for bitcoin because of the economic utility of a medium of exchange, they're paying based on speculation on artificial scarcity, which is not the utility of the technology.

A lumberjack isn't going to pay $10,000 for an axe if they can get an axe that cuts trees just as good for $100.

In economics there are basically no recorded instances where something with perfect economic substitutes can be thousands of times more expensive than its substitutes.

As someone who has an MS in Software Engineering, and has been a very successful engineer for many years in larger high transaction systems, i have no clue why you would adopt crypto.

"To some degree you are most certainly right. However you're missing a big point: they advertise with ""easyness"". You have to keep in mind that many people don't want to bother with storing and taking care of the private key by themselves. This reaches new customers that can trade crypto as easy as it can get and don't have to bother about anything else. 

Yes, it isn't perfectly secure. As is to store the keys by yourself (how many lost their own private keys?) - nothing is 100% secure. But I'd argue that if the Boerse Stuttgart is storing the private keys, they put reasonable money into security as they want to hold a good reputation. ",1526656307
"from my perspective, it seems about the same (actually way faster) to create a bank account.  I put a deposit in my eclair wallet.  That deposit needs to clear (its fine by the next day with a low priority fee) from there, I can instantly buy things through LN.  So basically you get all the convenience of a bank without having to use a bank.

For example I just wanted to buy a shirt with LN.  I didn't have enough funds in my eclair wallet. Doh.  So I transfered $50 into the wallet before I went to bed.  Next morning woke up with my 6+ conf and was able to spend the money.  

Its just going to take a slight amount of change in behavior vs bitcoin to become convenient for people to use it.  Instead of spending it instantly and then waiting for 6+ conf before the merchant trust you, you pre load it into your spending account and then when you do the actual transaction, its instant.   So the main btc wallet is more like a savings account and the LN wallet is more like a checking account from that perspective.  

Its all really quite logical if you just shift your behavior a little bit. ",1526656301
"You can’t “invite” or “uninvite” the government. They’ll do what they want. And generally the government is more effective at deterring and punishing theft than community efforts.

If we blacklist the gox coins and no one accepts them as bitcoins, then they are effectively not bitcoins.

"&gt; Valid point but even those are still raising the attention. Adoption and exchange rates are not the only indicators of Bitcoin's value, attention to the topic imho is just as important. Even if it's misunderstanding.

i can agree, particularly if at some point some kind of equilibrium-ish level is found where this level of risk appetite ""investors"" runs out, but they have strong enough hands to stay in, if it perhaps just steps up to some more stable level at which volatility becomes less and the appreciation stops being such a strong discouragement to actual use.

&gt; No such thing as bad publicity.

aren't ICO scam after scam plus exchange hack after hack horrendously bad publicity that does nothing to help bitcoin at all, and even harms it?  i think there's plenty of bad publicity.  i have some friends who think all of crypto is simply pure scam and the merits from one to the other are completely ignored.  if my friend already thinks that, it's not great for some crypto speculator to come up to him and advocate to buy bitcoin because, hey man, it just keeps going up.  plus the USD is going to fail just like the zimbabwe dollar, sentiment i've already read in this subreddit today.  which people have been claiming incorrectly for a long time, as they neither understand the economics of either country or currency.  this doesn't invite someone to think rationally about the possibility of crypto; it causes someone to dismiss what this person is saying entirely.  i don't buy that there's no such thing as bad publicity as an absolute.

&gt; A lot of people now, maybe for the first time in their life, actually start to think about how the world is run and what financial system they're depending on.

do they?  i'm a US libertarian and got interested in ron paul, politics, and money in 2007.  getting other people interested in how money works, particularly in a western country where it works relatively well enough for the mass populace to not care, is an uphill battle.  people know/care about how it works far more in a country where it's poorly managed whether zimbabwe or argentina.

of my friends that can speak to or hold bitcoin in 2018, i'm not sure if there's any more today that could speak to how the financial system is run than there were in say pre-bitcoin 2010 or so.  i'm struggling to think of any with holdings or even simply interest in bitcoin/crypto today that view it as anything more than a speculative hodl investment to make them rich, i know with 100% confidence that most don't know/care about how US/global money works today vs. 10 years ago.  and of the people online i meet who are more interested in that, they often seem to understand things so incorrectly to the point of it being dismissable as i noted above; i definitely think there are cases where no information or understanding is better than bad information/poor understanding.  even if the result might be a positive, that some people hear that bad info and take what i would consider a positive action of trying out bitcoin.",1526656025

"&gt;saying it doesn't have much inherent value isn't the same thing as being useless.

If having a public ledger is useful, then it has inherent value. Otherwise stated: The only case in which a public ledger doesn't have value, is a case in which it is useless. 

&gt;If it has inherent value, what would you be willing to pay for bitcoin if no one else was using it?

Does a ledger in accounting have inherent value? Does having an easily dividable medium provide utility for the people using it? 

The answer is yes. Let's say I'm a lumberjack, and you're a cook. 

I only have trees, and you only have food. I have to find a guy willing to trade trees for something that you'll find useful if I want to trade for food. 

Or, we could agree on a medium that serves as a middle man, all of the time, for every good. Value is created because we both save time that we would otherwise have to use to find suitable trade partners.

Every person that falls for a scam like this leaves hating crypto and hating the space. It also puts crypto in the spotlight, as is evident with a recent highly trafficked Wall Street Journal article claiming one in five ICO's are scams. I think that number is much higher and they had a high bar.

Imagine the impact we, as a community, could have if we self-regulated this space. A truly decentralized network operating without a central figure pointing out the obvious. 

Lets call on every site that lists ICO's to implement a simple vetting questionnaire. Considering we are starting at rock bottom, any improvement will drastically cut out scam projects.

Here's an example:
1. What is the problem being solved? Have other projects attempted to solve this problem? If so, why have they failed and why will this project succeed?
2. The team must be publicly identified with relevant qualifications listed.
3. What is the token utility?
4. What is the revenue model?

Publish these answers, let the community decide if the response is adequate. I suggest a word limit to prevent B.S rambling.

"Because bitcoin 'price' is determined by the tiny percentage of 'liquid' bitcoin in active trade on exchanges.

Today, according to marketcap.com $6.1B dollars worth of bitcoin changed hands. We all know the vast majority of these are flipped back and forth on exchanges (mostly by trading bots), but assuming each trade was for a bitcoin that was not traded further in the 24 hour period, only 753,000 bitcoin are in the 'liquidity pool' (as if bitcoin in themselves are NOT liquid, duh). 

That is only 5.3% of the 14M bitcoin already mined.

The vast majority are HODLed, as in, will NEVER be traded back to fiat at any price. This HODL wall scares the shit out of the legacy financial system incumbents. They are desperate to change their fiat wealth into bitcoin. THEY have an unlimited amount of fake fiat to 'buy' bitcoin in exchange for that fake fiat created by THEM out of thin air.

The intention is to use this artificial 'price discovery' in bankster owned 'exchanges' in conjunction with lame stream media narrative manipulation to try to get us REAL HODLers to part with our Bitcoin.

It won't work.

My recommendation to you is to forget about 'the price', zoom out, learn what HODLing actually is compared to holding, learn what the bitcoin  revolution is actually about, and make sure you pass the message on.

Bitcoin is about removing the power from the central banksters to fraudulently create money out of thin air to pay for endless fake wars.

This is far more important than getting rich in fiat value from 'trading bitcoin' to buy a lambo.",1526654640

"**Santander has scored a digital coup: the Spanish bank has become the first company in the world to use blockchain to make it easier for investors to vote at an annual meeting.**

The eurozone’s largest bank by market capitalisation said it and Broadridge Financial Solutions, a technology company, ran a test at Santander’s annual meeting in March.

Voting took place by traditional methods but they used blockchain, a giant online public ledger, to produce a shadow register.

The bank said its pioneering move could help revolutionise corporate democracy.

Investors at present often have to vote two weeks before a meeting to allow time for ballots to be counted.

The process has been criticised, and some people claim that votes are frequently lost or that it is difficult for investors to vote outside their home market.

Santander said the use of blockchain would speed up the process at annual meetings and make it easier for more shareholders to take part.

Sergio Gámez, global head of shareholders and investor relations at Santander, said the annual meeting was “one of the most important corporate governance events” for a listed company.

“In the case of Santander, having very fragmented capital, it is important to ensure the participation by investors and shareholders. This year using blockchain technology for the institutional vote has been a great help in terms of transparency and agility,” he said.

The bank has more than 4m shareholders with 60.7 per cent of stock belonging to institutional investors.

The proxy voting pilot, which was run in collaboration with JPMorgan and Northern Trust as custodian banks, included 21 per cent of those who participated in the annual meeting.

Blockchain, or distributed ledger technology, gained prominence as the technology underlying cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, but it has attracted increasing attention from traditional banks, asset managers and other financial services companies.

Santander has been one of the most active international banks in the area. Last month it launched a blockchain-based cross-border payments system and it has taken stakes in blockchain specialists such as Ripple and Blythe Masters’ Digital Asset Holdings.

Last month its Spanish rival BBVA became the first global bank to issue a loan using the technology, while UK group HSBC this week completed the world’s first commercially viable trade-finance transaction using blockchain.

Despite the rush of interest and several successful tests, however, some groups are sceptical about the potential to use blockchain at scale.

This year, academics at Tilburg and Ghent universities said blockchain could offer “smart solutions for classical inefficiencies in the corporate governance field”, arguing that it could reduce costs for both shareholders and companies by modernising annual meetings.

“Blockchain can . . . decrease the organisation costs for companies and increase the speed of decision-making, making the AGM a fast and lean corporate organ,” they wrote.

Justin Chapman, global head of market advocacy and innovation research at Northern Trust, said one of its asset management clients took part in the Santander pilot. “We are excited about the next phase in creating end-to-end vote transparency using blockchain as an enabler,” he said.

"&gt;Nobody claimed that well-backed criticism was invalid. The thing is, saying that bitcoin might be like a fax machine instead of email is not valid criticism, and the number of failed technologies doesn't change that in any way, shape, or form.

My criticism for bitcoin wasn't that bitcoin could be end up like fax machines, that was towards your meaningless comparison. I am not saying it will be obsolete, I am just saying just because email ended up being successful despite criticism doesn't mean bitcoin also will.

&gt;So you use it frequently for reasons that are totally unrelated to why it is actually useful, and that's somehow evidence for it not having a use case?

It has a use case, not as a currency. And without having a usecase as a currency it will not achieve widespread adoption.

&gt;Forex has some pretty high volatility pairs if you are dealing with emerging markets. Does that have any effect on it's value as a currency to the people that use it?

If there are currencies that can lose %20 of their value overnight commonly, you shouldn't be going into holidays with loads of that currency in your pockets. When was the last time you used zimbabwe dollars or whatever for an online payment or hotel booking?

&gt;So you're saying that forex is too much work to be of real benefit, because you have to exchange currencies? Again, this is not a valid criticism of bitcoin, because we have evidence of the exact opposite being the case. 

It has nothing to do with forex though absolutely notning to with forex market. the reason you need to convert your money to their local currency is you usually earn your money in your local currency and you would preferably want to spend it in the local currency of your destination. You don't even have to do it, your bank will automaticly convert your credit card payments. Bitcoin is not a local currency anwhere and most places do not accept it. Bitcoin is also certainly more difficult to buy or sell compared to common currencies, which you can do at airport as a worst case scenario.
",1526653863
"&gt;Fiat is not issued in any sort of distributed fashion

I would argue it is. Fiat is created based on debt. If you go to the bank to apply for a loan, the bank creates the fiat based on your pledge to repay.  Every $/€/yen/.. is created this way, based on someone or some government's pledge to repay. Banks cant create the money out of thin air, or for themselves like ICO do.  They cant ""premine"" it. They can only find people or companies willing to take on debt, and then create the fiat for them by accepting your loan (and taking on the risk you might default on it). I would argue that process is more decentralised than mining of any current crypto, and certainly than any non mining coin.

&gt;You seem to be missing the point that it is how the money gets created and what parties are able to legitimately create the money supply that are the core questions and the central distinction I'll continue to make.

Tell me then how for instance DAI is created in a more decentralised way than fiat? There is just one single ""bank"" that issues the DAI. Based upon collateral rather than a promise, but otherwise its a very similar process.

There only two crucial differences between fiat and all crypto's:
- fiat is debt based, crypto is not. At least for now.
- fiat has a government mandate, you are obliged to accept local fiat as repayment.

Thats it.",1526653831

"This is a good article. It's not because the guy was already rich from his finance career. It's because he explains the process by which a technology goes from being unknown, to being FUDded and described as impractical to taking over the world - he's actually summarizing an old Marc Andreessen op-ed, but still good. 

I always give the example of the Internet in 1995 but he mentions one more example I hadn't thought of - the personal computer in 1975-1980. 

Same process: early adopters and entrepreneurs and tech people say ""this is revolutionary"". The Establishment says ""Nah, it'll never work"" and lists a bunch of problems. 

The problems get solved, and suddenly the establishment races to get in and get involved and it goes mainstream and a new class of wealthy people are created from the early adopters. 

The Andreessen op-ed in 2014 says Bitcoin in 2014 is where the Internet was in 1993 or the PC in 1975 which I think was approximately right. 

In 2018, I think Bitcoin has moved on to about 1995-96 in Internet terms - the mainstream has at least heard the word ""bitcoin"" after the 2017 frenzy, but like the Net in 1995, people didn't trust it, didn't know what it meant and didn't understand its implications.

"its simple, instead of dumping it for cash, he can transfer all the BTC to multiple exchanges, swap them at BCH/BTC, crash BTC price while increasing BCH price. This way, there won't be a market crash, instead, only BTC crashes while BCH goes inversely up, riding on the ratio change.

Based on the amount that Jihan and Roger has, the amount they both hold should be sufficient to crash the entire BTC and suck dry BCH supply in exchanges around the world. The market will not be able to absorb that many BTC at the price of 9k, but with 10:1 ratio, BCH supply will dry up quickly, leading to a flippening. This is compounded by the fact that BTC will not be able to recover hashrate when BCH immediately pumps up. with 50:50 miners mining at the BCH pump, BTC transactions will open the floodgate at 1MB and all hell will break loose. We will see 300MB mempool once again where people are bailing out, running to exchanges to sell off before it goes to 0.

You need to close channels in order for btc to be transacted on chain and finalized. With 300mb, your channel will take forever to close.

Now you ask, why 5 years? Well, the purpose bitcoin exist was to flip the banks, create a true peer-to-peer currency without intermediary. Once the banks come in, hold on to useless btc shit, thats where you want to flip it. Dont flip when they have 0.01% stake in BTC, you maximize damage by crashing it when they hold 10 - 15% in BTC. Then proceed to throw all your hashrate behind the newly pumped BCH. Other miners will follow soon, this is the economic incentive that was designed by Satoshi in Bitcoin's whitepaper.

"Hard not to get into full shilling mode here. Been part of the community since 2014. I've very excited that this project is stepping out of the shadows after many years of tech development.

It has been frustrating at times seeing a small team and small community working on something that is so ambitious and get so little acknowledgement of the efforts. Mind you the interoperability vision was there in 2014!

This project is all about true decentralization and about overcoming the tribal attitude we've been seeing in the crypto sphere. It's run by community members, some of who have paid functions like the devs.

It's about connecting the the communities of each project and allowing the great tech of each project to be shared with a much greater ecosystem.

Blocknet is a protocol first, a critical part of inter\-blockchain infrastructure as you will. They allow data to be exchanged between blockchains.

The first Dapp is their own decentralized exchange, BlockDX. This uses the protocol to check if traders actually have the funds available to trade with each other and it allows for value to be interchanged between chains too.

The trades are done thru cross chain atomic swaps. It is true wallet\-to\-wallet trading. Current state is a Beta. But get this: Trading fees/ protocol fees are distributed to BLOCK holders.

There is not company! BLOCK is needed as a trading fee and will be market\-bought on the dex. This is the reason why you want to own some. It creates buy\-pressure automatically with adoption.

Mind you the current state is a beta. Currently you'll need to download full chains for coins you want to trade. But that's also why the blocknet community is hyped about the release of Xrouter.

That will serve as the backend for any SPV \(lite\) client or ultimately a multiwallet that doesn't need to download the full chain. 

To get back to the protocol, imagine being able to build dApps with features from multiple chains. Being able to charge and pay microfees in any cryptocurrency for the services you offer.

If you are a dev, or have a sweet dApp idea, just start cherry picking the features you want from any chain and offer it to your target audience. 

Also, with release in July ERC20 will be supported \(using 0X\)

"Random factors? Like what? that after every single past bullrun and pullback there was a consolidation phase, and that we're arguably in the biggest need of one than ever before (shitcoin central).

Every single bullrun in the past was preceded by a pullback phase, a few bulltraps, a few bear traps, then consolidation into BTC/ETH, followed by a bullrun of new money entering, joining into BTC/ETH, eventually stabilizing as the inflated market from the new money started finding ""hey there's more to crypto than BTC"", and start investing in alts.

I personally think that sometime in the next 6 months a new wave of new money is going to be entering. I think right now we are in a really unhealthy place, with shit like dentacoin, bytecoin, etc all being pumped. The last few weeks have seen a bit of a reversal. When reversals happen, people tend to sell long shot alts and move heavier into BTC/ETH. 

You want to be in those place BEFORE they come in, not after, so that you get inflated as people move money out of shitcoins.

I personally think this is a good time to make that play, you don't need to. We're both guessing at what's going to happen. If you think alts are going to swell while BTC goes sideways then go heavy in alts. I think the opposite will happen.

I dumped my EOS after learning about Brock Pierce and other info, and I only bought BCH because I accidentally followed the BTC subreddit and FOMO had me taking them seriously until I widened up.

"No, if anything it's the opposite that will happen. People are gambling in crypto markets because investors have been reaching for yield for the past 8 years or so. A correction in stocks is going to coincide with less risky assets offering higher yields. *Those* assets are what will benefit.

To the extent that crypto investors see stocks and crypto as substitutions for each other (I don't personally, and a lot of people here don't), those investors will more likely move money *out* of the exotic investments.

A common rebuttal to this reasoning is that people should view crypto more like gold, and that in an upturn it'll blossom as a negative-Beta asset. This is delusional, in my opinion, even for people who are optimistic about crypto in the long term. Gold's status as a negative-Beta asset has very little to do with its intrinsic qualities, and much more to do with tradition and centuries-long treatment of it as a safe harbor for value. Everyone agreeing to that fiction in spite of its weirdness is why gold works the way it does. But the key to that working is the scale, which crypto doesn't have yet. So until then, it's more realistic to treat crypto as simply a high-risk, high-yield asset that will experience outflows if a market correction brings higher yield back to assets with relatively lower risk.",1526652630

&gt;Bitcoin's transaction spreading protocol is vulnerable to deanonymization attacks. 

&gt;When a node generates a transaction without Dandelion, it transmits that transaction to its peers with independent, exponential delays. This approach, known as diffusion in academia, allows network adversaries to link transactions to IP addresses.

&gt;Dandelion prevents this class of attacks by sending transactions over a randomly selected path before diffusion. Transactions travel along this path during the ""stem phase"" and are then diffused during the ""fluff phase"" (hence the name Dandelion). 

&gt;We have shown that this routing protocol provides near-optimal anonymity guarantees among schemes that do not introduce additional encryption mechanisms.

*(Source - https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2018-May/015956.html)*

From what I can tell, it randomizes what peer it chooses to route a transaction through *(Assuming lightning here, more detail on the Github wiki -- https://github.com/mablem8/bips/blob/master/bip-dandelion.mediawiki)*

This provides transaction and network anonymity which will kick out the legs from under most privacy-based coins.

Exchanges are the new banks and I'm okay with that, and the ones that are already in the top 5... Do you guys look and see what the CEOs of exchanges wear... It's natural it's people like you and I.

"Ah... thanks for the article. Although, the author is using his current bank holdings (most of which he bought at bargain prices AFTER the crises started) to argue that he profited off of government bailouts. This is not accurate. Buffet himself actually bailed out Goldman and aided the bank bailouts by investing in them when everyone else was selling. This is why he's so rich. Finally, you have yi understand the nature of the bailouts. They were loans to the banks that were paid back in full. I'm not defending it, or saying it was right.

But now, if bitcoin is reliant on the banking system collapsing. Isn't this bit of history a mighty lesson that it probably won't ever collapse?",1526648940
"&gt; Crypto could have been amazing, but btc should have continued going up from 20k to be 100k by now.

Yeah coulda shoulda woulda my friend, don't be delusional. The tech is good but the fact remains that the demand is not there and might not ever be. The possibility of it going to 100k is just some bullshit spouted by people who are holding and want to get rich. ",1526648908
"It is technically feasible. /u/Chob_Gobbler is just angry for being ignorant. There are a ton of hardcore networking people within the community. 

There are a multitude of reasons. 

1) the founder Synth is quite eccentric to put it nicely. I highly suspect he is on the spectrum. Many people are really put off by his demeanour and grandiose claims. People think ""how can a project that has been developing for 7 years is suddenly only coming out into the spotlight now? Meanwhile they are saying these crazy things like free transactions, blockchain 3.0, decentralised the internet, new consensus algorithms etc""

Yes, the project have been developing for 7 years and it was developed by a very decentralised group of developers. In fact, many early developers of ETH and BTC have contributed to Skycoin in one way or another. 

However, they were so technically minded that they though ""who cares about marketing? the market will obviously gravitate towards the best tech naturally"". They were WRONG. And they also realised that marketing cannot be done by a decentralised group of developers. 

Skycoin's github didn't have a name for the first 4 years. This is how ""technically minded"" they were. They didn't begin advertising until early 2017 and at the time they just created the Telegram room. Synth even said ""there are probably only 200 people that know Skycoin right now"". This was in early 2017. 

Because of a combination of this. This gives the image of Skycoin being a scam. A random project that came out of nowhere claiming ""started by early developers of BTC and ETH"" and ""we have free transaction with our brand new consensus algorithm"". On top of that Synth hasn't been great at PR. 

But if you look at the github, it's one of the most active github in crypto. 

Look at the Telegram channels. It's literally the opposite of moonbois especially in the DIY miner channels. 

2) Is that there is a group attacking Skycoin constantly. I know everyone says that but I know for a fact that there were bots spamming the r/skycoin subreddit for a long time. They had to ban over 500 accounts for spamming. The articles floating on the web are also paid for by our attacked (impossible to proof but that's the rumour). All those claims in these FUD articles can be answered if you just find someone who knows Skycoin. 

Hope this helps. ",1526648885
"What will happen to the market? With everything coupled to Bitcoin in some way, are we looking at another crash?",1526648883
"&gt;  I dont really agree with people saying ""dont bother looking at the past"" in context of graphs/predicting the future because for sure there is something to learn by analyzing price behaviour?

We absolutely agree there.  Most people around here think TA is voodoo magic, I'm not one of them, sorry to assume you were.  The problem with this is that it takes a lot of time that most people just don't have.

&gt; As a goof, would you bet against the marketcap going down to 250k in the next couple of weeks?

If the market cap goes down, then price action would be below the 55EMA and I'd be in cash which is a bet against the market.   So yes I would, and currently I am.   The difference is that I don't treat it like gambling, guessing on a point, I react to hard data and my investing mentality is that I don't have a dog in the race (although I'm very pro-crypto in my heart, my brain disconnects this).

&gt; Where do you look to automate it? Anything reliable? More than stoplimit buys/sells.

I program so I do the trade automation myself and use trading view for my positions.  DM if you want to talk about this, it's too complex of an issue to deal with in a comment thread and is very off topic.  I don't use bots because I don't trust 3rd parties with my private api keys so I really don't have any suggestions on something you can download and use.  Perhaps someone else has a suggestion.

All that said, it's an every 4 hour thing and trading view has alerts that can be sent to via text or email to let you know you need to trade.

&gt; Ill read up on 55EMA when I get home

EMA = exponential moving average.  It basically takes the last 55 (in this case) bars and averages them out weighing the most recent as most important (that's the exponential part, there are others).  End result is a line that's overlaid on your chart of choice and you can clearly see if price is above or below it .. that's what I base my trading on as when price is above it, it tends to continue rising until it crosses below it, which is when I move back into USD.  Difficult concept to understand at first but it lends itself to be a pretty simple trading strategy that doesn't rely heavily on the voodoo magic mentioned above.

[Here is a bird's eye view of the crash from Dec-Feb with annotations of what would have happened using this strategy](https://i.imgur.com/8hqKK7Q.png).  Green BTC is buy, Red $ is sell.  55 EMA is yellow line and the green line over the candlesticks is the price action.  Instead of losing money during dips, you're accumulating more BTC.   You're in the market for any gains though.  True, you never buy the bottom or sell the top, and there is some wash trading (didn't annotate that, mostly break even after market buys/sells) involved when price peaks over for a little bit, but it's pretty safe and again, easy to understand.

Nobody has any idea what the actual convergence price of BTC is. It could be $8k, $1k, $1 million, or $20 bucks. 2. If it does get adopted, it's deflationary nature will cause people to horde it as opposed to spending it.

"Not to me, but this is what I've been watching ever since the Aug 1st fork, when BCH came into existence. BTC's mempool went apeshit and then it wasn't able to work as a currency anymore, because of its high fees, simply because the general consensus for their dev team was that ""BTC should be a store of value"". Ever since then, everyone seemed to think like that, and now we're here.

This is just an example, if it happened to LTC or even ETH I'd say the same thing. But I do realize things are at a point where it's really beyond our advocacy like you said. The only thing left to do now is raise the right kind of awareness to people, or we're gonna fall into the ""it's a Ponzi scheme"" mindset all over again, because again, people think it's crypto""gold"", not crypto""currency"". It's like I give you a dollar and say ""hey this is gold, treat it as such"", and then you die from starvation because you never spend it. Idiotic comparison, but that's the best I can do.

I actually care a lot about cryptocurrency as a whole, not that it's gonna substitute fiat or anything, but that it sets us free even more. Thing is, some people don't want that, thus we're battling over ideals for roughly 10 years ever since BTC came into existence.

The difference is that companies make money, and they pay a dividend. A pretty normal dividend level is around 5% of the company market cap. So if a stock costs 100$, they'll probably leave a dividend of around 5$ each year. That means that even if you are unable to find a buyer for your stocks, they won't be worthless, they'll still pay 5$ each year. And even if the stock price falls to 50$, then you'll get 10% dividend each year (5/50), and for that kind of return you'ld be happy to buy more. This is the difference to bitcoin.

"I already replied to you, but econ 101 is not sufficient to understand how OTC markets work. 

To understand why an OTC trade doesn't actually effect supply, you need to understand what % float is. 

In equities, % float is what % of shares readily change hands. A lot of stock is typically locked up in pensions, has vesting periods, and other factors. It is not readily liquid. 

Long story short, what drives the price of bitcoin isn't how much bitcoin actually changes hands, but rather, how imbalanced the bid/ask volume is. 

If their are 4 times as many ask orders than bids, then you would expect the bid price to move closer to the ask price, which means sellers would be getting fills closer to what their limit order is, which in turn would drive down the price over time. 

While the supply of bitcoin certainly matters in the long run, it's almost entirely independent of the current spot price. The part that really affects the current spot price is the current buyers and sellers putting orders into the order book on exchanges, which simply does not happen with OTC trades.

"Firstly, ""its a lot more egalitarian than fiat"" is not an answer to ""bitcoin was intended to be the most egalitarian currency distribution ever conceived"" when clearly just having a flat reward rate until they hit the cap is more egalitarian. 

Secondly, people like the OP think that the first adopters of Bitcoin are going to become the new 1%, they imagine a vast transfer of wealth via monetary deflation from everyone else in the world to the people who own the majority of the new currency.

Why is transferring a small percentage of value by inflation intolerable theft (a percentage that would be made up for with taxation if it didn't happen), yet transferring the vast majority of the worlds wealth to less than 1% of the population by deflation somehow good and more egalitarian?

Do you think that central banks have transferred the vast majority of wealth to themselves? 

If Bitcoiners get their way, people like the Winkelvoss twins will be the worlds first trillionaires simply by hoarding the money supply.

"&gt;I see that as just an attempt to leech off of the success of the Bitcoin project

If BCH was ""just another alt"" I would agree completely. It pisses me off to no end that so many shysters have used the terms ""bit,"" ""blockchain,"" etc. in their name or the color orange in their logo to imply that they have some claim to the bitcoin ""project."" It's fundamentally dishonest because it is done with a specific purpose in mind.

The thing is though, Bitcoin Cash was forked from the original Bitcoin ledger specifically because there was a fundamental disagreement regarding the future development path of bitcoin. Even if you think big blocks are dumb, you must recognize that the people supporting big blocks are sincere in their love for the bitcoin project and they really, honestly believe that the market will eventually prove their vision is correct. Tons of BCH supporters have been into bitcoin since way, way before the start of the Scaling War and they support Bitcoin Cash because they want to see the idea of bitcoin succeed and take over the world. I don't think they are trying to trick anybody any more than someone who claims Mormonism is a better version of Christianity than Catholicism, if they really believe that joining the Mormon Church is the only way to save your eternal soul. (Not the best analogy, but hopefully you see what I mean.)

&gt;I'm a co-organizer of the Seoul Bitcoin meetup. Interestingly, we've decided to chat about the definition of Bitcoin to see if we can come to an agreement. We have no BCH supporters who regularly attend, but we don't all have the same opinions on this topic.

I applaud any development to improve Bitcoin-based cryptos in this area.

I am one of those stupid scammy dumb mutherfucking roger ver loving completely retarted bcahsers. 

In 2011 I read this on the internet: 

&gt; Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non-reversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party.

&gt;What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party. Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers. In this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions. The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes. 

But you know what Satoshi, fuck you for making us all excited for nothing.

your stupid invention can only do 400 000 tx per day and after that you need to pay more money then I ever had to pay paypal or visa.

And also, I need to wait like for hours and hours and hours. 

Yeah Satoshi you where so wrong. What you build is stupid. Bitcoin can't be a currency. It does not work because the more people use Bitcoin the more centralised it becomes! That's why Bitcoin only works when we keep it small and only use it for speculation, not as money.

You should have thought it through a little bit better Satoshi. Look at you, you dumb dumb shitty guy. 

Why did you even write shit like this to [Mike Hearn?](http://i.imgur.com/ok74kiT.jpg) Everybody knows you are totally wrong! Your invention is shit, it does not work because when it becomes successful it stops working. 

You are not a GOD satoshi, you could have never ever predicted that a bunch of bankers would infiltrate the bitcoin community and then hijack the entire project. Artificially prevent Bitcoin from doing more then 400 000 tx a day and then tell everybody: Hahaha we where right, Bitcoin does not work.

Greg Maxwell, Adam Back ... all of them from the beginning TOLD YOU.. in your FACE that it would not work. But you did not want to listen and build bitcoin anyway. So they just had to destroy it, just so they could tell you.

While I have no problem with Bitcoin Cash - Imagine if Core had released their software with a similar license stating it could only be used on the Core blockchain. Forking BCH would have required much more work, and may not have been viable. What if part of the community in the future doesn't like the way BCH is developing and wants to fork?

"This article will be useful for those who already know about Scientificcoin project and have read my previous publications. It is important to remind that we do not intend to have a conventional ICO and attracting investments for the project was not the only goal we focused on when creating tokens. We have been developing the project for quite a long time and now it is in its closing phase. As I already wrote in my previous article, SNcoin will exist on the basis of Ethereum with a fixed amount of 100 million tokens until the platform is launched in February 2019. After launching http://scientificcoin.com platform, an algorithm specially created to regulate additional emission of coins intended for mining and remunerations for experts will evaluate statistical data from the previous periods of the platform operation:

the price of the coin at exchanges; traded value; the number of unique holders and experts; scientific projects placed on the platform; and project ICOs successfully held on the platform. This algorithm will create a kind of an emission quota for the next year. Coins will be generated automatically by means of mining and in the course of experts’ actions for project assessment.

After the platform is launched (02/2019), each Scientificcoin token created on ERC-20 will be replaced with SNcoin in a proprietary developed blockchain. Token holders will exchange tokens themselves. In order to do this, they will need to download Scientificcoin Client.

I have already described the reasons why we are using ERC-20 tokens with their further replacement: https://blog.goodaudience.com/you-may-call-me-captain-obvious-but-one-of-the-main-goals-the-developers-set-for-themselves-when-ddfb4a9b5bb7 . In brief, it is necessary for faster attracting crypto enthusiasts to the project as they are mainly using Ethereum. All replaceable tokens will be accumulated in a special wallet and withdrawn from the circulation.


Now, I am going to detail the first emission of tokens, their first owners and the procedure of their distribution. On the first day of the issue of tokens (which is going to take place one of these days), 464 addresses controlled by experts in different scientific disciplines specified in this list will become their owners. All the disciplines are represented by a group of scientists, mainly from Akademgorodok. Free coins will be distributed from those addresses for popularization of Scientificcoin platform.

Today, lots of new cryptocurrencies and ICOs distribute their tokens using Bounty Campagne and Airdrops. Firstly, this method is threadbare and those same-type gifts have lost their value as valuable things normally have to be deserved. Secondly, most participants of Bounty Campagne, etc. have turned into bots with fake accounts in Twitter and Facebook or those nobody reads as all they post is ICO advertisements on their pages. There are even groups aimed at topic promotion on Bitcointalk including guys with 10–20 high rank accounts. Their goal is to keep the advertiser’s topic at the top. For this purpose, they write comments and discuss the project but even this scheme requires understanding of the project by those advertising it.

Of course, we need promotion, and we are going to use all kinds of marketing tricks but at a whole new level, without any obvious commercials or naïve comments. In some way, we will also use Bounty Campagne, but in our own unique version. Young people about 20 years of age are to become active participants of our platform. They will be mainly students and people interested in science and self-education.

We have already provided a service on our website for taking general knowledge tests in order to engage young hopefuls to develop the project and to acquaint the most gifted of them with teams of scientists in different academic fields. SNcoin will be paid to them as a reward for their online activities and they will be able to save or exchange them for weekly trainings conducted by famous experts in different spheres, inventors and professors. These will not only include webinars but also conferences held in different cities. Mainly Akademgorodok residents who regularly give talks at international conferences in western countries will be speakers within the next few months but as the platform develops, we will engage speakers from other countries.

This is how we are going to distribute most Scientificcoin tokens among young hopefuls. Nowadays, the number of students throughout the world is 153 million which is much more than the amount of coins we have allotted for this purpose (40 million coins). In order to register on http://scientificcoin.com and start working with the platform: gain access to analytics; become an expert assessing scientific projects, an investor concluding smart contracts, a miner, etc., you have to have 1 or more SNcoin.

This amount of Scientificcoin tokens will be distributed among 464 scientific disciplines on the first day they are created. It is important to note that the terms and conditions of the smart contract restrict their disposal: not more than 10% of the initial amount per month.

Remunerations for Bounty Students will start from 10 coins for a repost in a social network (it can be received only once). All other tasks with fixed fees will be available after passing a general knowledge quiz which is already available on our website at http://scientificcoin.com/0quiz. Thus, we expect that the average amount that can be made by an active student within the year 2018 will be about $1000.

I wrote in my previous posts that we had a successful ICO a few months ago: http://healthmonitor.io. We did not consider any other way of advertising the project apart from using Google AdWords or Twitter ads, and news websites dedicated to cryptocurrencies or bloggers are too expensive and inefficient, in my opinion.

Popularity of cryptocurrencies and growth of their value often depend on how widespread they are but, since most cryptocurrencies do not have any backing at all, creators of new tokens exchange them for any advertising services easily, disregarding their quality. As to http://healthmonitor.io, we could not give away tokens due to the specific character of the project but in the case of https://scientificcoin.com, moderate rewards will motivate students for some easy advertising activity which they would not do for any other projects, not related to education and science. By the way, the significant factors distinguishing http://scientificcoin.com from other crypto projects guarantee the proper attitude to the coin. Well-educated people and those striving for personal growth are not likely to sell small amounts of coins for next to nothing immediately after they get them as they will consider it more reasonable to leave SNcoin for the future. Thus, demand for Scientificcoin will grow and keep drawing interest in the cryptocurrency environment.


30 000 000 will be available for purchase in the automatic mode through the contract address. During the first days after creation of Scientificcoin its price will be $0.1 for 1 token. This money will be used for development of Scientificcoin platform, advertisement and attracting platform users. Before Scientificcoin platform launch in February 2019, we will have to create more than 500 smart contract templates based on requirements elicited by the platform beta version which is to be launched at the end of May 2018.

15 000 000 coins will be owned by 42 team members able to dispose of their tokens with some limitations. In 2018, any http://scientificcoin.com development team member can dispose of only 10% of the total amount of tokens he or she owns. Starting from 2019, they will be able to dispose of not more than 3% of the total amount of tokens monthly and the rest will be available without restriction since 2020.

Remaining 15 000 000 coins will belong to Scientificcoin foundation supporting science advancement. This foundation will support scientists, students and even inventors who do not have any academic degree. Grants, donations and scholarships will be paid after annual Scientificcoin holders’ voting. What can be simpler and more transparent than a blockchain-based voting? Simple majority of votes will be required to solve any issue related to the work of the foundation with a quorum of at least 25% of the total number of token holders. One SNcoin is equal to one vote. Items for a voting agenda will be prepared in advance and published on the platform’s website not later than 2 months before the day of voting.

In conclusion, I would like to express my opinion that young people are inherently not able to value time. They can do foolish things or create unique innovations with the same ease, depending on the conditions of play. We expect that attracting well-educated young people to the platform will help create a flow of creative energy: up-to-date and vibrant, able to support the interests of the entire community.",1526639859

The true value of Bitcoin isn't unique though. Certainly not $8000 per coin unique. There's no value behind the coin to justify that price. It's unregulated market speculation. If banks truly felt threatened by Bitcoin they would simply change the way they operate to compete with it or pump and dump it into oblivion. Inflation isn't an argument against fiat in stable economies as the effect on consumer purchasing is almost always fractional. Bitcoin doesn't have much inherent value beyond speculating and as soon as the mining process is over another coin will take it's place and speculators will move to that. Bitcoin will then plummet again. Unregulated currencies just can not survive long term.,1526638925

"How many independent projects are there that implement the bitcoin cash protocol? I can think of 4 off the top of my head. How man active developers does each project have? This analysis could be performed for each coin and the number of developers summed up. You can do it yourself, I have no interest because I consider the result rather uninteresting and almost irrelevant. I suspect the results would be in the same ballpark at any rate.

What's important to me is what's happening to the coin, if the direction of development is something I can get behind, if I consider the future promising. As long as there are several teams and significant industry interest, the future is pretty much guaranteed IMO. 

I'd only be really concerned about the state of development if there were only one implementation, the code was poorly documented spaghetti, and there were only one or two active coders of significance.",1526636904

"Bitcoin ATMs are still growing in popularity. For an up to date list of locations visit [www.coinatmradar.com](https://www.coinatmradar.com) and you will be able to lookup rates and availability \(online status\) for most of the machines out there. Yes, they are reliable and usually the easiest way to purchase cryptocurrencies \(not just bitcoin, many more coins supported\)

You will need to use the Bitcoin /  crypto wallet on your phone. To my knowledge no ATMs accept debit cards as debit card charges can be reversed months after transaction took place. \(debit cards can be compared to 0 confirmation payments after months of even a year\) For this reason none of the ATMs on the market will support debit cards, you will have to bring some cash. :\)

Limits depend on local laws on cash transfers, only very few ATMs have no limits and the better models will allow you to lift those limits by providing a phone number or ID card. This is done to prevent problems with the local governments as ATMs are the most visible part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As such, you might have to come back a few times before you will be able to purchase an entire Bitcoin.

Yes, all ATMs will allow you to purchase directly to your wallet, some models will also allow you to withdraw cash from the ATM. See [www.generalbytes.com](https://www.generalbytes.com) for details on the different models of ATMs available.

"Bitcoin is now at ~35,000 PH/s. http://bitcoin.sipa.be/

That's about 2.5M Antminer S9s (if all mining were done with Antminer S9s, which do 14 TH/s).   Each is ~1,400W.   So that is in total, 3,500 MW, minimum.    Some older miners are less efficient, so we're seeing certainly over 4,000 MW now.  And that's just Bitcoin.  Bitcoin Cash is a bit over 10% of the Bitcoin hashrate, so that's about another 500 MW.  Ethereum, add another 1,000 for the electricity for their GPUs (guesstimate, based on all mining done with AMD 570s).   

So all electricity produced globally is about 25,000 TWh per year.   There are 8,760 Wh in a year so that's about 2,850,000 MW. 

Bitcoin + all other crypto at maybe 5,500 MW is thus ~0.2% of global electricity production today.   Hashrate still has not reached miner's equilibrium thanks to new lower priced ASICs, so even without a price rally, we'll probably rise another 50% of hashrate.  

But then let's say that 50% increase happens, and we're now at ~7,000 MW and then the price doubles, meaning hashrate doubles, to 14,000 MW.  That's pretty close to a half a percent of the world's electricity production.

Sure, there's a lot of ifs in that, but it is not inconceivable to see demand from Bitcoin miners to rise to levels that start to impact global electricity metrics.  And thus, likely would see policy start to address it.",1526634815
"&gt; the annual consumption of power from Bitcoin mining is 8.27 terawatt-hours per year. The global production of fiat currencies consumes 11 terawatt-hours per year.

This seems like an inappropriate comparison. You compare *one* A to *all* B and by the numbers it looks like A &lt; B, suggesting a false conclusion.

A better comparison would be to compare Bitcoin to *one* specific fiat, or to compare *all* cryptos to *all* fiat.

Either way Bitcoin would look worse which probably is the reason why you chose to put it that way.

"&gt;&gt;bitcoin is not a work of art or a trademarked product.
&gt;&gt;The same is true of Bitcoin Cash

Well it's not exactly the same because it's not backwards compatible. But that's probably getting off the topic about the name. But yeah my analogy isn't perfect either. 

I think for me, the bottom line is that Bitcoin is a specific project that began and ran under the ticker symbol of BTC. That project has never stopped running. So I don't think it's right to call another project Bitcoin. A project already exists called Bitcoin.

Calling another project ""Bitcoin Gold"" or ""Bitcoin Cash"" or ""Bitcoin Private"" is something I don't really like because I see that as just an attempt to leech off of the success of the Bitcoin project. However, I probably wouldn't have a problem shrugging that off.

Personally, I'm not going to shrug off an attempt by another project to simply call itself ""Bitcoin"" while the original project is still running. That's just subversion and dirty tricks. 

&gt;&gt;You keep calling BCH a copy, but it really isn't. It is a variant with an ancestor it shares in common with other variants.

I currently don't agree with you on this but I'm open to discuss the topic with the possibility of being convinced otherwise.

I'm a co-organizer of the Seoul Bitcoin meetup. Interestingly, we've decided to chat about the definition of Bitcoin to see if we can come to an agreement. We have no BCH supporters who regularly attend, but we don't all have the same opinions on this topic.

"**Bit**

The bit (a portmanteau of binary digit) is a basic unit of information used in computing and digital communications. A binary digit can have only one of two values, and may be physically represented with a two-state device. These state values are most commonly represented as either a 0or1.

The two values of a binary digit can also be interpreted as logical values (true/false, yes/no), algebraic signs (+/−), activation states (on/off), or any other two-valued attribute.

"&gt;Your comparison to taxonomy is more about discovery and observation. If you create a sculpture called ""whale"" and I copy your sculpture but perhaps make some edits and I call mine ""whale"" - that's a problem. Where do you disagree, here?

I don't disagree about the sculpture, but bitcoin is not a work of art or a trademarked product. We at least know who created the sculpture, it has an owner. Who created Bitcoin Cash? I'm not trying to nitpick. I think this is a very deep question that everybody should ask themselves.

Bitcoin, to me, is less like a machine or an institution, and more like a living thing. Yes, the basic idea was invented by somebody or a group of people, but it does not belong to anybody and it is capable of either dying or living and changing in a way that cannot be easily anticipated or controlled by anyone. 

&gt;You can follow the PoW of BTC all the way back to the genesis block and everything is still backwards compatible. 

The same is true of Bitcoin Cash. When I parse the blockchain using Bitcoin ABC or Unlimited, it goes all the way back to the genesis block. FWIW, I think of BTC and BCH as two different manifestations of different visions for bitcoin that for better or for worse, diverged somewhere around 2015/2016.

&gt; Poor people living in Africa today can barely afford a smartphone

you obviously have no idea about present day africa. i've seen smartphones everywhere in all african countries i've traveled and, trust me, there is a internet connected western union shop in every fucking village, no matter how remote. these tiny shops will start leveraging the possibility of verifying bitcoin blocks via satellite and use long range radio or mobile networks or whatever is available to them to replace the current remittance business. the money these people will save on transaction costs (5-15% !!!) will easily be enough to cover the cost of running dedicated bitcoin and LN nodes as well as satellite receivers and radio antennas. on the other hand, with BCH and gigabyte sized blocks, only the rich elite in these places will have a chance to participate in the network as sovereign actors, everybody else will have to trust SPV nodes.

&gt; Everybody hates those stupid bloatware apps 

why would you run a LN node on a smartphone instead of having a dedicated device at home that you and your friends/family point their wallet apps to? 

&gt; The limit on BTC will increase exactly when Core and Blockstream say it will increase. It has nothing to do with community consensus

isn't it somewhat ironic that you say that just a couple of days after BCH hardforked because it's 5 developers and jihan wu decided to raise the blocksize? i've seen so many people in the BCH community question the need to increase the blocksize when there is hardly even megabyte sized blocks. but there was no discussion and a fifth of the network got kicked out of the network. over here in bitcoin-land this would be regarded as disaster. 

&gt; the number of BU nodes

you know very well that a large percentage of these nodes are run by a few entities. have we ever seen these large cliffs in the number of nodes that signaled for segwit? reality is neither black nor white, you always have to differentiate. 

&gt; BTC diehards don't seem very happy at all with BCH existing

in fact most people couldn't care less about bcash. but in order to keep our ecosystem open and safe for newcomers we have to speak out against scams and fraudulent behavior, like bitcoin.com is engaging in. 

&gt; where did that couple-thousand dollars (LOL) worth of coin raised for the bitcoin.com ""lawsuit"" end up landing

"&gt; Not sure what the difference is except PR paraphrasing which says the same thing but better. Of course hes selling this to the banks, he has to have funds that can be frozen or reversed or they won't buy it: 
https://ripple.com/build/freeze/

read my other comment about you not reading your links. Also XRP is for crossboarder payments, you don't want to have reversable transactions when messing with foreign FIs and for domestic use the bank has their own system with whatever rules they like (My guess is we will see central bank issued crypto (additional to fiat here)
&gt;I see this argument among Ripple holders a lot 'they wouldnt do it because it will kill their business'. Would you use the same reasoning for Lehmann Brothers in 2006? They will never prop up the housing market, they have the most to lose. No they don't, these people are already rich off you. They dont have anything to lose anymore as you and other holders have already given them your money. I see no problem in them just moving to the next scam. 
Like, brad is already sitting on billions, all the ripple employees have probably cashed out enough to live forever. Not sure what problem any of them would have in reversing a tx that serves more of their purpose than propping up the illusion that XRP is a crypto. theyll just easily move to the next money grab, what does it matter to them? You and I lose, like always.

I just wanted to give you a non-technical argument because you don't seem to comprehend the technical side (can't read your own links)

&gt;Not really. It's solving the problem of liquidity. Trust between FI's was never an issue of some crypto facilitating it. Meryll Lynch and Bank of Japan can chose to use one of their own tokens for settlement too, if they'd agree to do it with XRP. 
If you think xrp is trying to solve the trust issue i think you may be thinking of bitcoin. You by definition cannot have a trustless economy on something held by a single organization with a single point of failure and too much expectations from the individuals involved to do the right Thing

Yes the use of crypto (e.g. XRP) solves the problem of trust between FIs, like I said. Liquidity is solved by market makers, exchanges and the trade volume of the cryptocurrency used.

Obviously you don’t want to pay taxes but taxes are what build roads and schools and pay for education and health care (in most places). What’s wrong with having this information given?

Wouldn’t this legitimize it more with governments who are calling crypto a criminal enterprise?

If crypto is like a bank where you control the Key the govt should know about it. They know how much you have at Citibank or Bank of America. It is a means for tracking large transactions for criminal activity.

Let’s face it- if you are not committing crimes what do you honestly gain from hiding? Wouldn’t mass adoption be preferable to having it banned?",1526628035

"this is what frustrates me about the fud surrounding mining and destroying the environment. bitcoin is energy intensive for a reason: to ensure security through game theory. 

people just need to be creative about how to utilize the byproduct of heat generated from mining. 

1. you need real world costs/investment from the natural world to keep miners competitive and honest by having skin in the game and losing real money if they cheat. that's how bitcoin achieves it's security: through game theory.

2. the majority of energy consumed in bitcoin mining comes from surplus power - power stations that now have a revenue stream to commit excess electricity that otherwise would have gone to waste which was the situation before bitcoin mining. 

3. people are already experimenting  with heating their homes with mining. they have even devised a system of heating the water for a fish farm and greenhouse ecosystem:
http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/bitcoin-mining-greenhouse-fish-farm-1.4470295

bitcoin mining could be a net positive for the environment: imagine home appliances that mine while not being used or re-distributing usage/power to other devices.
