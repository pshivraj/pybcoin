"&gt; Bitcoin is Turing complete.

*sigh*

No, it's not.  If bitcoin script was turing complete, it would be possible to write a finite-length bitcoin script capable of emulating an arbitrary turing machine.   You can build a turing machine that can theoretically get stuck in an infinite loop.   A finite bitcoin script cannot emulate an infinite loop.  Q.E.D. Bitcoin is not turing complete.

&gt; Bitcoin (BCH) can scale. Ethereum can't.

While I happen to agree with you about this, it's pure speculation.  BCH with a soft block limit of 32 MB will be able to support approximately 32*3=96 tx/s.  Eth currently supports about 15-20 tx/s.   While BCH is more, it's not orders of magnitude more.

&gt; Ethereum will not survive long term when it can all be done in Bitcoin. 

Not all of it necessarily *can* be done in Bitcoin.  Bitcoin script simply does not support nearly as many things as ETH does.  Even after the may hardfork for BCH.

Even if it could, there is significant ecosystem advantage for eth in the world of smart contracts that gives it first-mover advantage.  Lots of coins, block explorers.  Compilers, assemblers, multiple languages, documentation,standard libraries, tutorials,emulators etc.  Bitcoin script (Satoshi script) doesn't even have a functioning standard assembler, and is struggling to find support for a common *address* format.

&gt; I'm using small blocks on Bitcoin RIGHT NOW. the fee is 5 cents. Proof: https://imgur.com/qn5bOyn

I said when inflation disappears. You are using 5 cent fees because inflation is still high and adoption is low.

I doubt anyone would care about the nationality of the miners if they were European. 

&gt; And its not racist to call someone by their Nationality. Or is it Racist to call people Americans now? Canadians? Mexicans? 

It can be. Depends on the context. Is them being Chinese relevant? 

&gt; Calling a black person Born in Mexico a Mexican is racist! gtfo

Now you are simply clouding the conversation. We aren't talking about Mexicans with Chinese citizenship, we are talking about Chinese people of Chinese citizenship.

&gt; It is working perfectly fine right now. Lighting Network is for Big Businesses, 

That's not the plan. Im not sure why you think that.

&gt; There isn't enough traffic to warrant bigger blocks. YET. 

Sure there is. Blocks are full, that means there is enough traffic.

&gt; When the blocks are getting filled up by the Joe Schmoes of the world, I am sure Bitcoin will upgrade to a bigger block size. But until then, 1MB blocks are working fine. LN is for Wall Street. 

I don't know where you are getting your info from but thats not the saving plan. Core devs believe we should not let everyone use the main chain for ordinary transactions. We need a fee market to push them off chain.

&gt; Again, look into the DCG. Its Wall Street. And they are all in on Bitcoin and the Lightning Network. Not a Chinese Knock off Alt coin.

",1524633390
"As early as 2010 it was observed that someone (probably many people) were spamming the blockchain with millions of tiny 0.00000001 bitcoin transactions. These transactions are recorded in the blockchain forever, taxing every node with keeping the data on hard drives and wasting the resources of every node on purpose. long term this would discourage people from running nodes, which is a voluntary activity, without reward, and the backbone of decentralization. Decentralization is the reason Bittorrent is alive and well while Napster got crushed.

Bonus info: Such a spam attack was ongoing last December when tx fees on the blockchain were at record heights because limited space created a competitive fees market. By using up limited space the spammers were able to drive fees to insane levels ($50 to make a high priority transaction). You might well ask, who would waste money sending spam worth less than the fees? Well, they were selecting low fees and just clogging up the memory pool (RAM on each node) creating a back log so people who needed to make transactions had to out bid each other for space on the chain. ""Yes but who would do that??"", you ask. Miners, Bitmain is a prime suspect. Now that the industry has become Bitmain and a few others they can drive the fees up with spam (which they collect on top of the block reward, including their own fees they paid to send spam) since they are likely to be the ones mining the blocks. 


   

     ",1524633378
"I define ""spam"" to be tx's that are sent just to fill blocks or advertise. I assume ""spam"" TXs pay feels under 2 cents each. I believe spam does exist even though I understand the argument that any TX that pays the minimum fee is a valid TX. I think they are valid and still ""spam"". So, in my opinion, defining ""spam"" into non-existence is not really dealing with the ""spam attack"" claim properly. 

That said, how can core believers keep falling for the ""spam attack"" explanation for BTC's failure to scale. It could explain a full mem pool which makes BTC look bad, but, only the ""spam"" would not get into the blocks. Transactions that paid over 2 cents would all get into the blocks and fees would not go higher than 3 cents. Maybe all the real believers are unable to understand basic stuff or no one ever tells 'em how blocks and spam work? I think people saying there is no such thing as spam should tell the more complicated story about how spam does not make fees go up.

If people are trying to say the ""spam attack"" was accomplished by sending high-fee ""spam"" and since the miners get the fees, the miners can send high-fee spam and they get the money back.

cool. I think they've chosen GTFO. given your apparent distaste for the banks, at them why would you even consider buying credit from them? 

buying fiat financial products from institutional players is hardly the bitcoin revolution anybody had in mind.

"Forgot that in bcash land, up is down, black is white, etc., etc.

First off, Segwit implementation in Bitcoin is in no way equal to how Bitcoin Cash was created:

Bitcoin Cash was created through a hard fork. A hard fork is a non-backwards compatible change to the protocol. BCH diverged from the existing Bitcoin chain and became a new coin with its own set of rules.

Bitcoin has evolved through a series of soft forks using the protocol rules of consensus. Soft forks are backwards compatible changes to the protocol. Segwit was a soft fork done with consensus. It doesn't force anybody to upgrade and non-Segwit nodes still sync to the network.

Second: The Bitcoin protocol determines what Bitcoin chain is legitimate by establishing which chain is the longest, with the most accumulated proof of work, while following the rules of the protocol.

Bitcoin Cash doesn't follow the protocol rules of Bitcoin so it can't be Bitcoin.

Bitcoin Cash accumulated proof of work is a fraction of Bitcoin's. https://fork.lol/pow/work

The Bitcoin Cash chain is longer because on creation it installed a poorly programmed EDA which was manipulated by miners to mine blocks sometimes much quicker than normal and sometimes much slower. This resulted in there being approximately 8000 more blocks created on the Bitcoin Cash chain vs. Bitcoin during the period the EDA was in effect. This is an indicator of a failure not some kind of success. If the Bitcoin chain had split and a chain raced ahead processing blocks with relatively low amounts of hash power like BCH did it would have been quickly orphaned. Regardless block height doesn't matter to any claim that BCH supporters try to make to the Bitcoin name because BCH hard forked, created their own rules, and no longer follows the Bitcoin protocol.",1524631304

&gt; People won't pay that because with 1mb blocks 'people' won't even be able to access the bitcoin network! It's basic math. The bitcoin network can only support about two million active on-chain users; and by 'active' I mean just TWO transactions per month.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; If 100 million people wanted to 'own some bitcoin'; meaning directly on the blockchain, then they must move to the LN or some off-chain system because, again, with the 1mb block-size limit they will not be able to on-chain; unless they pay the same fees that banks and 3rd party vendors pay which would likely rise to the $20 range.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; For 100 million people to perform just two transactions on the main blockchain, with a 1mb limit, it would create a 3 year backlog of transactions!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Think about that for a second, if 100 million people wanted to hold value on the bitcoin blockchain; it would take over three years for each of them to post just two transactions. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; If you make the blockchain a very scarce resource relative to demand then, obviously, the fees will raise to a very high level so that it scares everyone else off to side-chains or alt-coins.

ratters own post on blocksize increase [archived](http://archive.is/2KDsC)


&gt; The solution to not raising the blocksize is 'fee markets', how much are you willing to pay to buy a cup of coffee?


https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3aha4h/the_solution_to_not_raising_the_blocksize_is_fee/


&gt; For years we were sold that bitcoin was a low cost payment system. We were excited every time another retailer announced they would accept it as payment.
It turns out that we were sold a false bill of goods and a fools paradise.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Now we are told, ""no, no, the bitcoin network does not scale"" (even though we were told for years this wasn't a problem because we could just raise the blocksize). The new story is that the blockchain is a scarce resource and we should fight to pay the highest transaction fees to obtain the privilege of getting a transaction processed.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Without raising the blocksize then fees will quickly rise to $30 (edit, old number) $9 a transaction or more as the demand increases and the block reward decreases.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Am I the only person annoyed they were lied to for years on this topic?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Can bitcoin still work as a settlement layer where a tiny minority of the population, mostly major banks, ever get access to it and, at that, with very high fees?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Yes, it can, but that isn't what I signed up for. I signed up for a low cost payment network, electronic cash, not a Fort Knox used only by centralized third party systems as a settlement network.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



&gt;&gt; **lucasjkr:** I don't think it's the miners that are pushing back against bigger blocks. They shouldn't be; with another halving coming up, and absent a huge increase in the price of &gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Bitcoin, there's a big fork in the road coming up, where either they'll need to collect much more money per transaction, or else be able to fit many more fee paying transactions in each block. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Unless I've missed something, I don't recall reading about any miners actively against an increase. Maybe Luke-jr is, but eligius is a tiny pool these days. The big 4 in China are for it, albeit smaller scale (8mb vs 20). 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Those against seem to be node operators, insistent on being able to ""support"" the network on the cheapest physical hardware, or cheapest VPS, that they can find, along with a group of devs who are worried about theoretical attacks. The chain isn't being spammed to deaths currently, but allowing bigger blocks would somehow cause that. Centralization fears seem like a false worry honestly, in that I feel confident that a large enough number of people will be willing to invest in a hard drive for their Pi node or else will upgrade their VPS to the next largest package. If we go from 6000 full nodes to 3000, I can't imagine that would be the end of the world...
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; **Ratters:** Agreed, great summary.
[archived](http://archive.is/J5rAF)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


&gt; Here's is Andreas /u/andreasma repeating, as he has many times before, that bitcoin scaling is 'no big deal'.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/01/blockchain-scalability.html
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; And, directly from the bitcoin wiki, as it has been there for years:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; ""With some modifications to the software, full Bitcoin nodes could easily keep up with both VISA and MasterCard combined, using only fairly modest hardware (a single high end server by todays standards). It is worth noting that the MasterCard network is structured somewhat like Bitcoin itself - as a peer to peer broadcast network.""
&gt; 
&gt;
&gt; The claim that bitcoin can easily scale continues here:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; One thing about scaling, is that people haven't done the math to figure out just how impossible it would be for hundreds of millions of people to have any value stored on the main bitcoin blockchain. Even if they were going to use blockstream or the lightning network for the bulk of their transactions, simply having value stored on the blockchain itself would be incredibly difficult with those kinds of numbers. And, if you imagine billions of people rather than 'merely' hundreds of millions, it becomes truly absurd.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; My point is, that even if off-chain transactions end up doing the heavy lifting for small day to day transaction processing, you still need to scale up substantially for a large population to have some value stored on the core blockchain itself.
[archived](http://archive.is/qY2QJ)

&gt;&gt;&gt; **Ratters:** Without raising the blocksize then fees will quickly rise to $30 a transaction 
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; **smartfbrbankings:** [Citation needed]
&gt;&gt; Assuming $30/transaction would mean that people who are paying a 1% fee to use Bitcoin would be transferring $777,600,000 per day to use Bitcoin. Either Bitcoin would be wildly successful for this to happen, or the fees don't raise that much.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; If this isn't what you signed up for, Dogecoin is that way ----------&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; **Ratters:** You are correct, the $30 figure is wrong, because it is based on old numbers when the transaction volume was lower and the price of bitcoin was higher.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; We must first realize that the block reward is going away. People like to cite the 2140 number but, in reality, the block-reward will diminish to a minuscule level in less than 20 years. Fees are supposed to replace the block reward.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; So, currently miners receive 3,610 bitcoins a day for the service of processing transactions; that's 3,600 for the block reward and about 10 bitcoins in transaction fees.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; That means that miners earn around $902,500 a day for processing around 100,000 transactions. This means they earn about $9 per transaction.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; After the block-halving, the average transaction fee will need to rise to $4.50 per for the miners to earn the same reward as they do now.

&gt; Considering what the bitcoin wiki says about scaling, as well as what every single promoter of bitcoin was saying for years, (that scaling wouldn't be an issue), is why I feel ""lied too"".
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; For the past several years if you brought up the scaling problem you were downvoted and ridiculed for not understanding Moore's law.
Now, all of the sudden, the blocksize is a holy relic never to be adjusted.

&gt; People forget that sidechains and payment channels still require settlement transactions directly on the blockchain. It helps with scaling, a little bit, but not much; because the transaction limit on the bitcoin network is so low that even with sidechains only a very small percentage of the population could even have entries on the main blockchain to begin with. Do the math.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; This means that everyone, the general population, will be forced onto centralized third party solutions which, in turn, means we lose nearly every benefit bitcoin was supposed to deliver in the first place.

&gt;&gt; **jrm2007:** I am convinced that Bitcoin is not to pay for coffee. It is for if you will, loftier things. It may not even be a currency which does not mean that it can't in some cases be used simply to buy things.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Maybe it is only to pay for usage of the Blockchain for non-trivial uses like deed recording, etc. 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; But I don't even think framing it as a currency is desirable. Making it a currency makes it a target of government and banks. Gold is mainly for jewelry and as a side effect of this it can be used to buy things -- usually not cups of coffee, however. [archived](http://archive.is/HKzTg)

"Shakepay is fucking crazy good. I’ve never used it to withdraw fiat, but I was waiting for some $$ to come in to buy crypto and it finally came in today, the day BTC pumped, of course. While the CAD price of BTC was over $12k, I sat back and bought in using Shakepay at just over $10k and they pay the BTC miner fees to withdraw. Seriously so awesome.

When I want to withdraw fiat to take some profits, I’ll probably just go open an account at Vancity or somewhere that hasn’t been fucking people over.

Attempting to scale to global proportions ""on-chain"" will eventually exceed the ability of ordinary people to provide nodes. Then the only nodes will be large organizations. That is centralization.

&gt; This is trying to solve a non-real problem. **The existing system is working fine. People make thousands of zero confirmation transactions daily and there are virtually no issues.** People are having transactions get 'stuck' but, not because their 'fee is to low', but because **the transaction capacity of the network is artificially constrained.** 
[archived](http://archive.is/84t0P)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


&gt; Regardless, this whole discussion is absolutely absurd. No one asked for replace by fee. No one wants it. It solves no problem while it creates many.
[archived](http://archive.is/rxE8X)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



&gt; Let's back up here. The claim is that RBF was allowed to fix stuck transactions. However, it does a whole lot more than that. It provides an official supported path to encourage double spends and fraudulent transactions. RBF also turns a highly constrained blockchain to act as an eBay style auction house where bidding wars can be established to get transactions handled. It is a horrific solution to the blocksize limit problem. Rather than increasing the blocksize limit so that all reasonable fee bearing transactions are safely processed, RBF is designed to create a fee market bidding war.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; RBF exists to turn the blockchain backlog into a bidding war. That is why it was created, plain and simple. Now stop acting surprised that people do not consider this a viable or desirable way to solve the scaling problem.

&gt; The use cases for RBF only exist in a highly artificially constrained bitcoin network. RBF was designed to allow fee markets to develop in this highly constrained bitcoin network.
Just don't claim it is about 'stuck' transactions that are stuck because the network has been crippled by core devs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



&gt; No one is basing large financial transactions on zero conf. People are basing small payments on it taking into account the acceptable low risk. I am completely befuddled about how this 'feature' no one really asked for, and as far as I can tell, almost no one even wants, was blithely accepted into the bitcoin core. When other developers wanted to incorporate a change which the vast majority of the general bitcoin community wants, a modest increase in block size, debate was suspended, people were banned, and that version of the software was described as an 'attack' on bitcoin and an alt-coin.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; To me RBF appears to be far more of an attack on the core principles of the bitcoin network than simply adjusting a single block-size parameter which is a less than a one line code change.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Actually, I think this RBF fiasco is a good thing; because I can't find hardly anyone who wants this 'feature'. Maybe this is what it will take for the community to realize that there is no 'official' bitcoin core client, there is simply the set of core rules that the community as a whole agrees to. I can only hope that no miners adopt this change as it is so clearly against the core principles of bitcoin. Creating a 'feature' which encourages double-spending is deeply irresponsible in my opinion.

&gt; Blocks should not be 'filling up'; the bitcoin network was designed to SCALE as usage increased. Artificially constraining the network to destroy key and critical properties is the problem.
[archived](http://archive.is/FtWdL)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



&gt; So, crippling bitcoin today based solely on the promise of a technical solution that won't be available for years from now, certainly makes no logical sense whatsoever.
[archived](http://archive.is/ghOGo)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



&gt; Ok, so we don't need it 'yet' but we add it anyway? Even though the community seems largely opposed to it. But you suggest we incorporate it now, 'just in case' we might need it in the future. Meanwhile, we need a blocksize increase immediately and we are not allowed to do something even as simple as just bumping it to two megabytes from one, because the entire decision making process is locked up. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Think about that? We could DOUBLE the transaction processing of the bitcoin network simply by changing a single #define from 1 to 2; but that is considered too scary and risky, even though Satoshi always suggested that raising the blocksize would be a natural thing to do as transaction volume increased.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Instead, RBF is invented as a scorched earth mechanism to deal with an artificially constrained network, and is readily accepted into bitcoin core even though the vast majority of the users of the network are opposed to it. Sure...makes perfect sense to me.

&gt; It was not previously possible to do a 'replace by fee' transaction was my understanding. How was it 'previously possible' to unstick a transaction by resending it with a higher fee, or even to resend it with different outputs? How was this 'previously possible'?

"**Analysis paralysis**

Analysis paralysis or paralysis by analysis is the state of over-analyzing (or over-thinking) a situation so that a decision or action is never taken, in effect paralyzing the outcome. A decision can be treated as over-complicated, with too many detailed options, so that a choice is never made, rather than try something and change if a major problem arises. A person might be seeking the optimal or ""perfect"" solution upfront, and fear making any decision which could lead to erroneous results, while on the way to a better solution. On the opposite end of the time spectrum is the phrase extinct by instinct, which is making a fatal decision based on hasty judgment or a gut reaction.

"I agree ""move fast and break things"" is a terrible policy but it concerns me this apparent [paralysis by analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis) state we are in. The changes we have in place for the upcoming HF would have taken less than a week to deploy back in 2010. It's actually interesting to think it required a totally new client (ABC) to spearhead the fork and now it's arguably the most conservative of the clients. Unfortunately it seems like great innovation depends on people with ""nothing to lose"" that needs to devote massive energy to fight for their ideas.

When presented with multiple choices, a market with rational actors chooses the best solution, not the ""best solution given the creation constraints"". So, in my humble view, selecting a proposal just because of the fewer changes required is unreasonable. Suppose we have 5 competing solutions and each one forked bch into new currencies. After some time (and a few total failures), it doesn't really matter solution A had lower risk by the time of the fork than a bolder, better and working solution E. But forking is too laborious, it'd be great to find a way to overcome paralysis by analysis and bring healthy innovation to life.

Your proposal doesn't require any changes to the network rules, which by itself is a great advantage, but as a result it comes with many limitations. It makes perfect sense to try to sell it to the token interested community to see whether it fits their needs or not.

&gt; I have not a good grasp of the current state of all the complexity in counterparty, though.

Counterparty is incredibly simple. If you only consider token issuance and transfer, it's really close to your proposal. If you are interested, it takes 5 mins to read the sections 'Transactions' and 'Send' [here](https://counterparty.io/docs/protocol_specification/).

&gt; Do you think that is not enough of an incentive? If so, can you explain what is missing?

I do. We can't just rely on honest people doing the right thing for something to work. This is the reason it took us so long to have a working decentralized digital currency (think b-money and bit gold). Sure, if you consider everyone else is playing fair, anyone could run a validator even without some kind of reward. But what happens if malicious actors manage to somehow overload the validators? What if it's truly successful and there are many many token transactions to validate? For no reward, some of the validators might just quit and leave the burden to the rest, until no one is left validating.

As a side note, I saw you use Electron cash. Running an ElectrumX server is much more expensive than running a bch/btc node and we simply take it for granted. They have no incentive for that and they are extremely important to support further adoption. What if we really manage to bring 1 billion people to use bch everyday with SPV wallets? Do we really expect these servers to continue doing all the heavy lifting for free? I think the costs will be prohibitive.

&gt; What do you think about that?

I like it. You've just solved the side chain distribution issue. If you further decide that you don't need the whole transaction structure just to store the token transfer data, you might converge to counterparty.

I'm not an expert in token systems, so take my opinions with a grain of salt. I feel it's important to reiterate that I really appreciate your work. Please keep me posted! Thank you",1524630520

4. Bitcoin (BTC), and only Bitcoin (BTC), can say that it has BOTH the highest proof of work AND can process transactions from 2014 software.

5. As long as both of these remain true, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has no reasonable way to claim to be Bitcoin, and when the day comes that both of these were not true for Bitcoin (BTC), the blockchain with the most proof of work will be called Bitcoin (which Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is WAY behind in the proof of work race).",1524629501

"Wanting permissionless money doesn't mean that a person has to accept that in all areas of their life. 

The Bitcoin protocol is permissionless in the sense that no authority can decide whether or not you can make a transaction. The Bitcoin protocol isn't without rules though which is more what I think you are implying. It's code. It's full of rules.

One of the basic rules written into the code is that Bitcoin is the longest chain of blocks, with the most amount of work, which follows the rules. There is nothing in the code or any of the discussions between Satoshi and Hal Finney I have read where it says ""Bitcoin is whatever the current dominant group of people say it is.""

I think people just take the word permissionless and misconstrue it to mean things it doesn't in the context of Bitcoin. I know that free market libertarians, cypherpunks, anarchists, etc. are an important part of the Bitcoin community but some of them sometimes talk and act like Bitcoin is a literal expression of their chosen ideology.",1524629380

Core people also like to imply that making blocks 1 MB won't impact the things they criticize in BCH, but of course it will, unless they delete all the blockchain. It also grows indefinitely, only slower, and layer 2 won't prevent that. It is really a series of non-sequitur arguments to justify lightning network, which is already a failed project.

The difference in BCH is that we are scaling the blockchain to handle these problems core pretends do not exist and that segwit+LN is a panacea, a cure for all the problems. It is very dishonest.",1524629301

"Since you don't seem to have any idea, Bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto. The ""original"" working client that Satoshi coded himself was version 0.1. He remained project leader through development to version 0.3.16. There is no doubt, whatsoever, among anyone, that version of the software Satoshi was running is and was Bitcoin. BTC today is an unbroken continuation of that blockchain in every way. The present version of the reference client is version 0.16 and it's backward compatible with the V0.3.16 node that Satoshi was running as lead developer. BCH, on the other hand is not compatible with any previous version of the Bitcoin software, not V0.1, not V0.3.16, not V0.16 or any of the other 50+ versions the reference client has grown through. Satosh Nakamoto, with his unquestionably ""real"" bitcoin node running 0.3.16 could not interact with the BCH chain, at all. Likewise, no BCH transaction would be recognized by Satoshi's 0.3.16 node.  

Conclusion: Yes, there is a real Bitcoin and BCH is not it. 

So your opinion(s): 

&gt;there's no such thing as an existing definition of the real bitcoin.

&gt;Fundamentally they're both correct because there is no absolute definition, it's all about perspective and what in your opinion is the direction 

&gt;there is no fundamental absolute truth which chain is the truest one and both groups have the right to claim they are correct 

.. is complete horse-shit. 

BCH does not compute. Not according to Satoshi Nakamoto's node. **Therefore BCH is not Bitcoin**. 

And that's without even mentioning the norms and conventions in open source software development. Ubuntu is not the real Debian.

Your whole post and presence in this thread seems to be about subtly lending legitimacy to BCH as having a claim to the Bitcoin name. I'm glad to spoil all your work because as I've demonstrated, it does not.   ",1524629067

I would advise anyone invested in cryptocurrency to please understand how this system completely fucks over the American people.

Everytime a loan is issued in dollars - because of fractional reserve banking, the currency is inflated. The money is created out of nothing. Banks can loan much more than what they actually have.

If we did not have fractional reserve banking, this would not be possible as banks could only lend out what they have on deposit.

"Ironically, had Wikileaks not blown Bitcoin out into the open so soon (meaning organisations like EFF had to drop early support) then we probably wouldn't even need coinbase (or any exchanges for that matter) since everything would be running through the one decentralised client.  Sadly, that didn't happen because the few people in the world who truly understood the technology had to stop coding and take to essay writing and conference speaking in order to defend the idea before it had yet had a chance to truly mature. 

And yet everyone soldiered through the fallout that came from that WL announcement (and Satoshi's resulting sudden departure) and gritted their teeth as the old fearful world descended (and with it the business get-rich-quick brigade that saw nothing but dollar signs)...  It has taken many, many people (in both old world and new) to undo the damage from that fallout; they have written millions of words between them in essays, emails, tweets; words they would have much preferred to be typing into a compiler alongside the small esoteric group that truly grokked the 'WHY', as well as the science behind all this.  

Instead, many of the people behind all this had to face up to their fears and go into 'the dragon's den' in the spirit of bringing everyone together in order to shepherd bitcoin back into the light... On that journey, both the old world and new learnt a lot about each other and realised a lot of their assumptions and fears were unfounded.  Andreas [meeting with the Canadian senate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUNGFZDO8mM) to allay such fears is a beautiful example of old and new working together.

I think a strong argument could be made then, that the Wikileaks announcement setback the relatively plain sailing that was bitcoin development some 5 years or more (and with it, Bitcoin's ability to understand and quietly address the many problems people working in the light in that old world faced).  Whilst I understand the impetus for the WL announcement was an American financial system pulling the kill-switch on them, if money was all Wikileaks needed... then they had plenty of supporters in the UK and elsewhere able to keep them afloat (WL had a plethora of wealthy, high-profile supporters back in the day). 

Ultimately, Coinbase should be commended for the hard work they have done in easing tensions during that very chaotic time... IIRC anyone wanting to start an exchange there needed a $1m money transmitter licence per STATE simply to get off the ground... Most U.S. companies simply bailed out and moved to another country to work on bitcoin, Coinbase figured out how to play within the rules...   And yes, that meant complying with the same onerous set of regulatory hurdles that your average bank faces.  

It *is* sad that coinbase are having to cut ties with WL and other organisations that might rise eyebrows with old world regulators, but if that's the price we have to pay in the interim for a stable, user-friendly 'bitcoin bank' in this space that is capable of onboarding millions of ordinary everyday citizens (without risking closure) then so be it.  We must recognise with all the scams out their targeting the less tech savvy (again, because the tech came out too early) a 'bitcoin bank' is *exactly* what some people need right now.

Thankfully, this is no longer 2013 and there are plenty options out there now for those who are not a good fit for that environment.  

It would be helpful to everyone in this space if Wikileaks - instead of trying to fight the existing reality -could instead take a leaf from the [Pineapple Fund](https://pineapplefund.org/) initiative and start focusing on the light ahead and all the good they could be doing with their holdings (thanks to those early bitcoin believers that have kept them (and the rest of us) afloat all these years).  Given Julian grew up on an old abandoned Pineapple farm, I'm secretly hoping that's exactly what they've been doing :p

If the size of the blocks causes fees to increase, to levels greater than people are willing to pay, the miners will have to change something, likely paying for improvements/optimizations to the protocol.

No it does not. Bitcoin is designed as an evolving biological org so it can survive. 

&gt;* Segwit did increase the block size. By less than 10%. It did not drive the fees down. It (being a soft fork) did not prevent the community from splitting. 

SF it's always safer if you have (economic)  majority. Of course you can't force someone to not create their own coin.
Fees are 1 s/byte.



&gt;* LN will never work on a big scale. There's not even a proposed solution to the routing problem. 

Scaling strategy is taking tiny txs offline in a trustless network. Routing can be optionally and efficiently done with large LN nodes the same way now Coinbase, Kraken and others do today (but in a trusted way). That's an option. If you don't want to use a supernode you can always route your tx on smaller channels.

Bigblocks should be the last option. 

&gt;* Bitcoin is a great idea and can work, despite all the Blockstream propaganda. 

Stop the Blockstream conspiracy nonsense, it's damaging for your argument. Most core devs don't work for that company.

Not everyone will be using the Lightning Network. Everyday joe schmoe can use the Bitcoin Network like how we are using it this very day. It is working perfectly fine right now. Lighting Network is for Big Businesses, who have millions of transactions a day, and then they can settle on chain ONCE, at the end of the day. So they don't clog up the network. There isn't enough traffic to warrant bigger blocks. YET.  When the blocks are getting filled up by the Joe Schmoes of the world, I am sure Bitcoin will upgrade to a bigger block size. But until then, 1MB blocks are working fine.  LN is for Wall Street. 
 
&gt; Wallstreet money isn't interested in innovation. 

Look up the Digital Currency Group and look at who owns them. Look at all the Crypto Businesses Goldman Sachs is buying.

They want the status quo. New money, investor money is moving to BitcoinCash because Bitcoin Cash wants greater adoption. 

Again, look into the DCG. Its Wall Street. And they are all in on Bitcoin and the Lightning Network. Not a Chinese Knock off Alt coin.

petulant sarcasm aside, you do correctly imply that they're not benevolent actors. they're profit making institutions, concerned with the bottom line of their shareholders above all other things.

if you believe in crypto, feel free to invest *your* money.

The product is the protocol like what IPv4 and IPv6 are to the internet which is working and improving by the day.  It's not JUST a currency but will facilitate many other use cases in the future.  Adoption is a gradual process.  And if it happens, I would venture to say that traditional metrics of investments like market cap and supply won't mean much.

&gt;Because it’s not, core break their Bitcoin version.

&gt;Bitcoin IS peer to peer cash, however the only version of Bitcoin which continues that original on-chain vision (and peer to peer, not peer to Lightning Network Hub) is Bitcoin Cash (BCH).

&gt;The only fork that does that, is BCH.


wow, you are a high falutin retard. I got to quote you incase you try to delete this. I want everyone to be able to read your dribble. 

Bitcoin core refers to the development team, not the Bitcoin Protocol. unless you say, bcash, bitcoin cash, or BCH, everyone will assume you are talking about Bitcoin. lol, you got to add your little identifier to it. 

Again, how is Bitcoin not Peer to Peer cash? If you post up your address, I can send you as little as I want. The fees are 6 cents right now. Seems reasonable to me. And it confirms within 10 minutes. Oh yeah, you got in a hissy fit cuz it got slow once, last year and you jumped ship like a little bitch into an altcoin. BCH. Why aren't you guys on the reddit.com/r/BCH ? 

Just because the Lightning Network exist, doesn't mean you need to use it. The Lightning Network is for Business applications. Regular people can use it if they want, but they wont need to because the Bitcoin network will be flowing like how it is today.

You want in on a secret? Wall street owns most of Crypto. Maybe not the coins themselves, but 85%-90% of the Crypto businesses. Coinbase, Circle, Poloniex, Abra, pretty much all of them. Not Bitmain though. Thats Chinese. But here is the deal, Nasdaq owns the Digital Currency Group (DCG)look at DCG's portfolio. ran by Gary Silbert. Big Wall Street Hedge Funder. Check out his bitcoin fund, GBTC. His Bitcoins are selling at a premium of $16.8k right now. Lightning Labs is also being funded by the DCG. 

The Lightning Network is being built By Wall Street FOR Wall Street. We are on the preface of something huge. Wall Street is about to turn on the firehose into cryptos. But not into Bitcoin Gold, Not into Bitcoin Private, Not into Bitcoin Diamond, and not into Bitcoin Cash.  They are going to unload into Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum.

My working theory is that Wall Street did a test. They started flooding their money into Bitcoin in September, november and december and it got clogged up. It ran up the price, but the blocks were being filled up to 1MB and slowing down the network. Its true. Decentralized Blockchains are not very efficient. But the Lightning Network is on the Brink of coming online for Wall Street to use. The Lightning Network isn't for you and me. We can do on chain transactions no problem. Its for Businesses like VISA who process Millions upon Millions of transactions, and they can just settle on LN and do a single on chain transaction at the end of the day. And that way it wont clog up the Bitcoin Network for the rest of us. 

The Chinese realize this and they have co-opted Ver and a few others to trick people into buying up bcash with Bitcoin. You can't watch that video of Ver saying Mt. Gox is Solvent and say he isn't a conman.  There are many other coins that do ""instant transactions"" better than bcash. You want a fast coin for daily transactions, use Digibyte. Blazingly fast.

I like how ""bitcoin.com"" fraudulently misrepresents bcash as ""Bitcoin"" now without even a qualifier. A coin that relies totally on counterfeiting/identity theft because it cannot survive on any merits of its own. You know that at some point someone with money is going to get burned by that kind of scamming, and the legal battles will not be pretty or turn out well for your scamcoin and its cartel of ringleaders. Just something for you and your naive investors to keep in mind.

One more minute on the it's-not-censorship hypocrisy clock. Keep in mind that bcash has fees, is controlled by self-interested miners who jack it around to their own benefit, and is making itself vulnerable to spam bloating with 32 MB blocks on a chain that doesn't need 200 kb. blocks. Nano is dramatically better on all such fronts, being free, faster, more scalable, and without damaging the environment or being subject to miners control. So why are you wasting time on an outdated and undersupport scamcoin that 85% of the crypto community passionately hates as the plaything of frauds like Ver and Wu and Wright?

"How can it process 100 times the data? Your math doesn't add up. 

Bitcoin Cash 8mb blocks can hold double Bitcoin's 4mb blocks, but it isn't as efficient. Bitcoin Cash handles double the transactions for 8x the resources. Bitcoin testnet is 1 Satoshi oer byte, and Bitcoin is 3 Satoshi per byte. The fees are as low as BCH despite handling 11 times the transactions and 30 times the amount of outputs. 

Why would you spend 8 times the resources to get double the capacity?

It's not that I am against the block increase, it's just... What the fuck? FlexTrans fixes the mallability, but Segwit does the same while increasing block size without increasing chain size, meaning the nodes still process 1mb to hold the 4mb blcok weights. 

Just think, what if Bitcoin Cash just implemented Segwit, then they'd not have to fork again (because now there are already 2 separate Bitcoin Cash chains who fight, BCH and Bitcoin Clashic) and they'd get 4 times the space. 

Plus, they'd be able to use LN, which is capable of competing with Visa in it's current form. ",1524621270

Since ABC just stood for ""adjustable block cap."" Both xt and unlimited were already known in the community and I'm assuming they liked how Bitcoin Unlimited used ""cash"" in it's implementation name it ended up being a quick and easy name that would not ""hurt feelings""

Development
The first implementation of the Bitcoin Cash protocol called Bitcoin ABC was revealed by Amaury ""Deadal Nix"" Séchet at the Future of Bitcoin conference in Arnhem, Netherlands.[19] Subsequently, Bitcoin Unlimited made its first release of Bitcoin Cash compatible software, named BUCash[21] and Bitcoin XT also released before the Bitcoin Cash fork.[22] This meant that 3 full node clients were available before the Bitcoin Cash hard fork on August 1, 2017.",1524621116

"Yeah, the global, agorist crypto economy would like a word with you.

Just because *you* don't use it as a currency doesn't mean it isn't used that way.

Crypto is a class of its own. It has properties that are similar to currency, investments, and commodities, but it also has properties that is different from those things.

This is uncharted territory, and our current culture has yet to develop a good grasp on the underpinnings of the implications that crypto will have on society.

We are living in a time where we now realize a new possibility and like with pretty much every modern field of science, are approaching the realization that our current models of economics and finance are incomplete.

I also do not use it as a currency, and I also don't solely hold bitcoin.

I think of Crypto as the financial instrument that is emergent from the information age, just like stocks (or at least common stocks) were the financial instrument that emerged from the industrial age.

People will probably lose a lot of money, but the ones who lost the most during the crash of the 20's were the people day trading.

Most of the people who invested in a diversified portfolio of stocks in the 20's, and managed to hang on to them through the depression might have had a few stocks end up being toilet paper, but many of the companies weathered the depression and ended up being very valuable.

I can't tell the future, but that pattern seems too close to be coincidental, especially when you saw similar things happen when humanity transitioned from an agrarian economy to an industrialized one.

My plan is to do my research, invest widely, in small amounts, and frequently, and then not really think about it until it's time to retire. I have other investments as well to rely on for that in case crypto doesn't pan out for one reason or another, but I really doubt smart contracts aren't going anywhere, so my money is on shit be changin', yo.",1524621069
To do that the P2P protocol needs to be rewritten and right now that is completely unnecessary. 32 MB will allow Bitcoin Cash to scale up to about 10% of all tx that Visa does. Should be good for the next 10 years. The maximum block size only needs to provide enough room so that no tx is left behind. ,1524621061
"When buying altcoins, one strategy is to wait until bitcoin hits a solid rock bottom floor, which last time was around $6600, knowing that once bitcoin rises there will be enough confidence that the altcoins will go up with bitcoin.

The reason why several altcoins suffer right now is because people bought them at a far lower price (see my previous section) and are selling them for profit.

However, since bitcoin will likely keep going up and pass at least 10k-11k, altcoins should recover gradually depending on their respective sell pressure.

If bitcoin experience huge drops at some point that is breaking the positive bull momentum, without being able to hold proper ground, then that's when you will likely see a major sell-off of altcurrencies.

Due to these mechanics, bitcoin tend to increase its market cap percentage when the its drops sharply, as a result of people selling altcoins and consolidating in bitcoin, while it loses some of its market cap percentage when the price is going up and you have bull terrain momentum, since then traders have more confidence in diversifying in alts.",1524621045
"I'm off to bed, but it has been a nice chat. You've made me consider some things that I had not thought about before. However, I do think you vastly underestimate the difficulty of this problem and overestimate the capabilities of commodity hardware. These computers need ms route computation which would be a challenge if the algorithm was *linear* in the number of edges \(I wouldn't say the difference of an iterated log makes it *much* faster when the other factor accounts for most of the weight\), especially considering the highly dynamic nature of the edge weights and the existence of the nodes themselves. Forget everything else\-\-just keeping that information up\-to\-date and consistent across the network is going to be a huge challenge. I think most engineers recognize this as a path that seems less than promising. Also regarding the importance of nodes, we can agree to disagree, but bitcoin worked just fine before ""full nodes"" were a thing.

And yeah in December that was a funny irony\-\-the camp that wanted to keep the system such that it could run on an rPi was the only one of the two coins that was having issues running on an rPi bc the mempool was too large for some of them \(admittedly, probably on low end rPis wo any additional storage, but still\).

The subjective theory of value is a theory of value which advances the idea that the value of a good is not determined by any inherent property of the good, nor by the amount of labor necessary to produce the good, but instead value is determined by the importance an acting individual places on a good for the achievement of his desired ends. The modern version of this theory was created independently and nearly simultaneously by William Stanley Jevons, Léon Walras, and Carl Menger in the late 19th century.

"**Henry Cisneros**

Henry Gabriel Cisneros (born June 11, 1947) is an American politician and businessman. He served as the mayor of San Antonio, Texas, from 1981 to 1989, the second Latino mayor of a major American city and the city's first since 1842 (when Juan Seguín was forced out of office). A Democrat, Cisneros served as the 10th Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in the administration of President Bill Clinton from 1993 to 1997. As HUD Secretary, Cisneros was credited with initiating the revitalization of many public housing developments and with formulating policies that contributed to achieving the nation's highest ever rate of home ownership.

"Of course I know venture capital investment is all about an eventual pay day, so please keep it real. 

Your assumption is guided by what you want to believe, its called confirmation bias. 

You would love to think Blockstream and AXA are in control of Bitcoin but the reality is no.

Blockstream is focussed on private side chains for business purposes and software for exchanges, its venture capital partners will benefit from the profit Blockstream will make, eventually.

Blockstream makes no profit from Bitcoin or Lightning. 

Blockstream developers assist Bitcoin and have been helping to implement Lightning.

Blockstream has liquid, it doesn't need Lightning

It's a symbiotic relationship, for mutual benefit not for the purpose of control.

Now lets turn the tables for a moment.

nChain and BU both assist BCH in much the same way Blockstream helps the coredev team and Bitcoin.  nChain recently did a deal with SBI bits banking.  SBI are mining BCH and will be in-bed with BCH in many ways very soon. Bitmains and ViaBTC have built a monopoly around BCH and are doing/have some very dodgy things. I see BCH now being centralised on a few fronts.  It's no longer grass roots or aligned with Satsohis vision, far from it. Even though Blockstream is helping Bitcoin it has not affected its open source decentralised nature, that remains fully intact. That cannot be said about BCH because its been 'allowed' to go off course, and now you have megalomaniacs like Ver, Wright, Ayre, Wu controlling/manipulating its direction.

Recently Wright said his vision is to use his patents to bring down other crypto-currencies and elevate BCH as the one and only crypto-currency.
No doubt Wright is super bright but he is also very delusional and mark my words 'he will ruin BCH' by making it a target for attack. 

The fact is people like Ver, Wright, Ayre and Wu will centralise BCH and bring it under their control, the process has started already.

"Ah, I see what you're saying. I would guess that your _R_ (the amount you're willing to risk per unit on a trade) is too low for the amount of volatility in this market.

In more fast-paced markets, you want to take a smaller position size with larger _R_. In the extreme, you have hodlers who are willing to ride their BTC all the way down to 0 - effectively, they've set their _R_ to the entire amount of the trade. This works because the market moves so quickly and they stand to double, triple, or even 100x their money - in other words, make returns of anywhere from 2R to 100R+, with a high enough probability that they have a positive expectancy. They believe that the market is so volatile that to take a smaller risk (for example, by setting a stop loss) would cause them to lose too many trades unnecessarily due to what is essentially noise. 

Contrast this with steadier markets like stocks, funds, bonds, etc - you'd take a larger position size but with a smaller _R_. A given percentage movement in a less volatile market carries more information than the same percentage movement in a more volatile market, so you need to set tighter stops to avoid bleeding out your account.",1524619335

Referring to BTC, but not BCH, by the title of its majority software client, is a strange inconsistency that always passes in BCH circles, that I can only conclude is deliberate. So widely does it pass, that pro-BTC guys who post here just to grief are called ""Core trolls"" and not ""BTC trolls"".

I completely understand having the opinion that Core controls BTC to the extent that it's ""their thing"". I don't understand supporters of a currency attempting to rename another currency entirely (goes both ways).

Bitcoin cash is magnitudes closer to what bitcoin's trajectory was years back, an actual peer-to-peer electronic cash system. The truly depressing reality of this is that bitcoin cash is considered to be an insult and attack to bitcoin core, when it's actually a struggle to preserve the history, integrity, and elegant genius of the original path. Newcomers to the scene aren't going to realize the dangerous path bitcoin core is headed, they weren't around to see what it used to be. It's a really unique kind of sadness to me.

Exactly. The vast majority of people who own bitcoin don't have the time to pay close enough attention to the politics so as to figure out all this stuff, that's why Core's deception has worked.

"Hi there, outsider here. Closest I have to coins are silver in my safe.

But I've been watching Bitcoin (and the developing alt coins) since 2010 or so. I haven't had the money, and talked myself out of a miner (I'd lose on electricity, you see, and I didn't think it'd break $100 per coin before it all went tits up. Yes I kick myself for this at least weekly.) But now that I have the money, it's way too hard to get good intel for me to feel comfortable dumping a couple grand in this. Everywhere I look, there's exchanges falling, wallets getting hacked, high fees and slow processing times. Not to mention the weekly ""x is a shill"" and ""y took my money"" and ""z just disappeared, taking millions of USD with them."" 

It's all very exciting, the wild west part of it is a big appeal, but until I can find solid sources I can trust, I'll stick to more conventional investments. Or miners and physical wallets. ",1524618208

"&gt; 1) it is not currently a viable mean of payment. Not everyone accepts it, mostly because;

Not many people accept my $NZ either. Outside New Zealand it is even more useless than bitcoin.

&gt; 2) it is not a store of value. Bitcoin is way too volatile to be used as a currency.

It is too volatile because it is too small a currency. Not enough people are using it to make it stable. If more people use it it will become more stable, meaning more people will use it, and vice versa. While I agree with this point I disagree at the same time because feedback loop.

3) Unit of account. How can you price something if the value of currency itself changes? 

See previous point.

TL;DR: Bitcoin isn't currency because it's not even money. It can't be money until it's value becomes stable enough that it won't fluctuate more than a normal inflation rate.

The question is ""is it a better *form* of money, this programmable money?"" Even if is the best form of money possible it can't be magically stable in value overnight because, as you've pointed out, that takes a lot of people using it, and that takes time, and something to really bootstrap its use; a killer app that *requires bitcoin*.",1524618069

This may piss off tech heads who enjoy Crypto for what sweeping changes it may bring to the world but I'm investing in crypto for the money. 

Iota, as of the moment, has around a 5 billion marketcap. This is very high. There is not much room for multiples unless Iota somehow hits 40+ million this year, in which at that point, it wouldn't really matter what coin you invest in within the top 30 as we would all be rich.

There is no finished product for Iota nor a hard release date. By this definition, it is still a concept. I cannot search Google and find a release date for the main product Iota is trying to roll out. Yes, I see that they have some titanic partnerships and they expect the technology to be done and implemented in less than two years. The estimates are all over the place and we are looking at tech that may not actually be out until the end of 2019.

"Yes its accurate to say that blockchains have never been hacked as such (DAO and other buggy code aside), but that is irrelevant to the question of security of ones money. When the underlying network is secure yet people are still losing money ""crypto"" is not more secure; its misleading to even bring it up. Bank vaults too are 100% secure until someone opens the door, but you have to open the door at some point.

People are equally if not more vulnerable to hacks and phish attacks when using crypto. They are equally vulnerable to the same ATM skimmers, IRS spoofs, identity theft and robbery too. Crypto does not fix a single one of those issues no matter how secure the underlying network is, instead it actually introduces a new issue of not getting your money back when you lose it.

The difficulties with using crypto are the flaw in it all right now, not the networks, until we have better tools and maybe one day more social awareness of crypto risks such that people will know they can't give people keys in the same way that people understand you can't set fire to $5 and expect to somehow get it back.",1524617230

"Why is Bitcoin valuable? Its unique security model. Part of that security model includes tens of thousands of node operators and billions of dollars in mining equipment. Even if you brought an overwhelming number of nodes and miners to have full control of the Bitcoin ecosystem the remaining ecosystem which finds this abhorrent would simply fork off.

Our economy, our user base, our miners, our nodes, our developers. We are all what make Bitcoin, Bitcoin. If we feel threatened we will simply cut you out of our decentralized club. If the miners threaten us we will change PoW systems. If the nodes threaten us we blacklist misbehaving nodes. We have many mechanisms to do this and talk about it frequently, in fact PoW change is luke jrs favorite thing and I don't really blame him.

We've even seen this plan in action when BCH forked for under a mix of ideological differences and fabricated pretext of attack. You won't ever stop Bitcoin and the people who know it is possible to come to a decentralized consensus from doing just that.

"Very very few? Have you seen how many dapps are on ethereum?

I think the biggest use case right now (since all people do at this point in time is speculate on coins) would be the dai stablecoin made possible by smart contracts. 1 dai = 1 dollar. Even when someone got liquidated for over a million dollars on their eth collateral, dai still maintained 1 dollar. This would be a decentralized tether you can trade in and out of. 

Another use case in this point in time? Decentralized exchanges. Kyber just integrated with mew as well so straight from your trezor or ledger you can swap any erc20 to any other. Very very minimal exchange fees (close to 0) and it’s instant with no trust needed and no ID. This is straight from the most used ethereum wallet and not using shapeshifteor anything. You can swap token to token or token to eth or eth to dai etc. 

These are just a small sample. There’s tons of other projects I’m pumped about for ethereum. At its height, (December Jan) eth processed 1.2 million transactions a day, bitcoin was capped at 300k. 1.2 million transactions was higher than every single crypto other than eth combined. 

This will increase with sharding. And sharding is not pie in the sky. Vitalik moved it up to coincide with the first part of Casper, to be released this year. That also allows the first part of proof of stake.

"Yes, you can still be angry, /u/Cthulhooo is doing the usual ""reddit contrarian"" argument, and while I love a good contrarian argument, this one lacks the depth required for a proper proof (and as I will demonstrate, the argument is invalid).  Malice behaviour is detrimental to any economic system, contrary to those people that hate libertarians, libertarians don't celebrate an ""anything goes policy"", libertarians celebrate free-market solutions that people voluntarily abide by.

Anything that interferes with a free market is actually very dangerous to libertarians, probably more so than it is to a system that can fall back on a powerful state government. In this case, Roger Ver is intentionally misleading newcomers or people naive to the crypto space. If Roger Ver was merely making another variation/altcoin, then Cthulhooo would be correct. This however, is not the case, Ver is (a) attempting to steal a brand, and (b) is doing this by intentionally misleading people. BCH forked from BTC, BTC still has the developers from before the fork, and there is a strong consensus among the community on which is the true bitcoin*.

These malicious behaviours are in viloation of free markets, you can't have a free market where fraud is acceptable and where you can't grow a reputation because people steal brands and identies. Free markets only work were there are the actors are rational, and the actors have good information (hopefully this point is intuitive to most readers, I don't have space to flesh this out without creating a 10 page essay). The typical libertarian solution to fraud is civil law, and in cases where offence is too mild to bring a law suit, it's seen as acceptable to use social pressures. 

It's also absolutely foundational that people speak up and say something or the fraud will continue and will get worse, so the ""You can but it's not gonna change anything"" response proves to me that this person has not actually considered the problem in depth. It is clearly a bad thing to have this issue going on, and it is important to do something about it. If being angry motivates you to write a post or act in a way that will better the situation, then be angry.

*To further this point, in case someone reading this sides with Ver, that BCH is the true bitcoin: If I make a new currecy called ""the true american dollar"" and I made it out of gold and silver (as per the constitution), I may be correct to say this is more closly aligned to what the founding fathers defined as money, but you bet your ass the US government would be coming after me for calling it an american dollar, and if I tricked someone into taking it, they would be rightfully upset if they were expecting actual American dollars. Here's another example: Anyone can fork the major currency and claim they are following it most closely to the white paper, what validates one claim over the other? It's the back end, the developers, the community, and the progression of a continuous project. BCH has an early adoptor that claims he is better at following a white paper, contrary to the vast majory of other early adoptors.",1524616214
"Mempool is a backlog of transactions (BTC has a backlog from time to time because there is a 1MB transaction limit. and more transaction demand than there is capacity.

[BCH]9https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#3,all)

&gt;So you say ""We see them all the time"". This shows 1 orphaned block for BCH and 3 for BTC. Has there ever been an entire blockchain (i.e. entire set of coins; I'm assuming they're the same thing) orphaned?

That is the orphan rate for that 1 pool. ( a block they mines that no one mins another block on top of so they had to abandon it (and not collect the reward.) I think the historic average is about 0.5% of blocks get orphaned. 

There was a fork not so long ago of 7 blocks, and one in [2010 for 53 blocks](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/3343/what-is-the-longest-blockchain-fork-that-has-been-orphaned-to-date)

"&gt; bcash is extremely expensive compared to many altcoins

Bitcoin cash transactions are free if you don't want to get into next block absolutely, actually. It doesn't get much cheaper than that. And typically about a penny if you do want to get into the next block. That's cheap in absolute terms, no matter who you are.

&gt; and bitcoin when I use LN. I pay 0 to 1 sat per tx with LN.

If you say so. Except that you have to lock up a lot of cash in Lightning, which has an opportunity cost of its own. And you must do transactions to get BTC into Lightning or out of it. So, your price quote is confounded by those variables. Not to mention the technical requirements of running a Lightning node and figuring out you need to do all that other stuff.

Showing me something even close to this for Lightning and you'll have a point:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4&amp;v=BF_ycdI4oF4

Here's a Lightning-proponent trying to do a single Lightning transaction, which takes 3 minutes to setup and ultimately fails:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgjUXi6XXFc&amp;feature=youtu.be


&gt; That is a mere 0.00009652 usd. Doesn't matter how large you raise the blocksize limit, fees will never be that low with bcash

Now imagine that opening and closing a transaction using BTC costs $50 each time.

You also seem to think Lightning can't be built on BCH, it can be.

And BCH transactions will always be cheaper than BTC transactions. 

So there's nothing unique about having Lightning on BTC, any blockchain can use Lightning, and it would still be far cheaper using BCH, but what's more, far more people can actually use BCH to on-board and off-board of a lightning network, due to the vastly increased transaction capacity and low cost.

So again, ceteris paribus regarding Lightning, BTC does not compare to BCH. Far less capacity, far higher costs.

As for other altcoins, they'll never have the network effect that we do, for the same reason they didn't threaten BTC for the longest time.

There are very few altcoins that can be purchased directly with fiat money. So, thus you must use an intermediary coin like Bitcoin or ETH, where you send it from Coinbase to a dedicated ""crypto-crypto"" exchange (like Binance). Then you purchase using Bitcoin or ETH. This is the case for most coins.

This is so crazy short-sighted. You can't go down that road with software like this, especially a protocol. I'm sorry, and I don't mean to be rude, it is just extremely ignorant.

Secondly, many Cashers claim the long term solution is simply increasing the block size.

Many cashers think nodes are not even necessary, which is just insane, and shows that they don't really understand how bitcoin works.

also, the big dumb question.. is now a good/bad time to throw some money into crypto?  as you can tell i'm still a tad shaky, i'm not looking for advice on WHERE to put money, i trust the friends of mine that are giving me advice.  what i'm wondering is if it is even smart to start now?",1524615194
"one way to think about bitcoin is like this:

80% of coins have been issued. Bitcoin had now split into many chains.   (miners are competing for the last 20%) Existing investors determine the future of hashing power by valuing the coins they hold.

Which chain is the one to survive we can't say definitively but those people who had keys pre the split have coins on all chains, you only lose if you sell your coins or as a new investor, invest in the wrong Bitcoin. 

I like to think that Bitcoin pre-August 1 2017 is now like a Bitcoin index consisting of BTC, BCH, BTG, BCD, etc.

In the short term money flows where attention goes, but over a longer time frame, the value is going to flow to the version that delivers the most utility for investors. The value of the chain will scale appropriately. Those chains that don't provide value will be abandoned. 

It is too early to tell the winners as 99% of the value is just speculation on future growth.  ",1524615175
"Discussions tend to drift from topic to topic and in many directions yes. 

But these are the answers i'm looking for:

How do you feel about the block size increases necessary to make LN functional? And do you know how big they will be? I assume they will solve slow confirmation &amp; transaction times as bitcoin cash did. Won't fees go to the moon when the mempool fills up again?

Why use bitcoin at all for a bitpay card. Why not just use any random tokenised (or not) blockchain ledger. I could copy paste a new one tomorrow from bitcoin

How would you intend to encourage spending of a deflationary currency? (Because I think the store of value theory has been thoroughly destroyed)

How would you propose people in unbanked countries secure their passphrases, it is a big enough issue in safe countries. And once it's gone it's gone.",1524615159

"&gt; you only needed to use the full node wallet IF you were mining

He is not talking about the initial state of bitcoin, that quote come from an email about future scalling.

I'll quote it again:

""Only people trying to create new coins would need to run 
network nodes. **At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware**. A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node.""

Thats what he tought about the future, be it right or wrong. You can say he is wrong (there are issues with scalling SPV queries to full nodes for it to work well without a huge cost), but don't try to change what he said. It is written in a very clear way: running a node would be left to to server farms.",1524615097

If we don't want to get too optimistic, we'd say that the multiple will be somewhere between 3x and 7x. This puts us somewhere between $29k and $67k. 

Of course... Bitcoin is weird and very volatile. So it could be some other crazy number way outside my estimate. If I was going to guess where we'd be around the end of the year, I'd say somewhere between 30-40k, but take that with a grain of salt.",1524615076

"The nodes are not comparable. 

In that comment he's asking if a lightning node is similar to a BCH node. This hints at what I'm talking about.

You don't need a full node on BCH to make a transaction. SPV nodes are a part of bitcoin's original design, it's in the Satoshi whitepaper. It is bitcoin.

You don't need to run a BCH node to receive a payment, for instance; you don't need to be online. Not true for a Lightning node, you must be online to send or receive payments.

You don't need to [put your private keys online](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7niwcs/wait_what_my_private_keys_need_to_be_on_an/) to send or receive BCH payments. Not so for Lightning nodes--and that's a massive security risk.

BCH nodes are not stateful, there's no need for Watch-towers to keep you from being cheated by other nodes. There's no way that your BCH node can get its funds 'exhausted' by others sending transactions through your node causing you to have to add more funds.

Beyond all that, Joseph Poon, one of the original creators of Lightning said that BTC will need roughly 133mb blocks in order to scale Lightning, because everyone must perform an on-chain transaction to get onto and out of Lightning, and 1mb blocks will make that nearly impossible. 

Someone did the math on that and figured out it would take something like 39 years worth of transactions for even 1 billion people to do a single on-chain transaction to open a lightning channel of their own.

Ignoring Lightning's scaling challenges that have caused some researchers to propose a 3rd layer on top of Lightning.

Lightning can't possibly be the way BTC scales, it looks more like the BTC ecosystem is being setup for failure somehow.

I'm putting my money on [Liquid](https://blockstream.com/liquid/) being the way that Blockstream intends to *rescue* BTC once Lightning reaches the breaking point.

But Liquid is a privately-owned sidechain that Blockstream alone reaps fees from. It can scale quite nicely, running on Blockstream's boutique hardware.

But it will mean everyone has to trust Blockstream and will be the death of decentralization.

But they'll probably say using them is just optional, even though it will be the only realistic way anyone can use bitcoin. Just like how high transaction fees make on-chain transactions optional, but they're using that to try to push people into 2nd layer solutions like Lightning.

And like Lightning, Liquid requires malleability fix and was proposed back in 2015 and hasn't been much seen since.",1524614951

Whew!  

Comes along Bitcoin that does all of these things by itself by you.  You setup your own account, you keep track of your money, you control your withdrawals and deposits, etc.  Sure you may pay fees to do those things but they are far more cheaper than the banks doing all of those things with different applications and architectures and not to mention there's hundreds of them around the world.

"Price stability is not a requirement for something to be a currency but it's one of the most highly desirable features for a currency to survive. when you get hyperinflation, even with strong government controls, people abandon the currency for practically anything.

Before I go on, I expect the bitcoin fanboys to point to weinmar republic and veneuzuela and zimbabawe and that the USD has lost 10% over 10 years or something. These are important things to note but the reason they are important is that the hyperinflation examples are rare and also illustrative of the importance of price stability. USD does fluctuate as do all fiats but it is rare that when you go grocery shopping, that the price of the bananas you just picked up will cost 10% more by the time you pay for them at the checkout. So before you fall into that trap of argument, think about why you're going down that path.

So - bitcoin is highly unstable in pricing. That makes it problematic. Most people need to be able to work out their expenses each month to survive. They rationally don't factor in that rare currency crisis event in their calculations. Or if they do, they can't afford to hope to mitigate that risk by having 5%+ monthly fluctuations in their incomes or expenses. that's why the populous can't just accept bitcoin as their source of income or their means of expenditure. And because they can't do that, mass adoption is highly highly highly unlikely if not impossible without government force (eg if the US government decided one day that they will only accept bitcoin as a method of tax payment - note it has to be the only acceptable method because as I stated above, if you have a more price stable alternative, like fiat, then then populous will stick to paying their taxes in fiat because they have more comfort in knowing what that ends up costing them).

You need mass adoption for the price to stabilize. But you need price stability for the population to voluntarily adopt it.

I guess technically it could be called a currency if you have one transaction per year in bitcoin but it's not a currency in any meaningful way. And it's unlikely to ever be.

It's a punt. And potential insurance against a crisis (assuming that's where people go in a crisis). But right now it's not really a currency. And as much as I hate fiat, I don't think it will ever be. It can never replace fiat because you're forced to pay taxes in fiat. And get government benefits in fiat. Fiat is the way value is forced through the financial system. ",1524613930

"**Begging the question**

To beg the question is to assume the truth of the conclusion of an argument in the premises in order for the conclusion to follow. It is a type of circular reasoning and an informal fallacy, in which an arguer makes an argument that requires the desired conclusion to be true. This often occurs in an indirect way such that the fallacy's presence is hidden or at least not easily apparent.

The term ""begging the question"", as it is usually phrased, originated in the 16th century as a mistranslation of the Latin petitio principii, which actually translates to ""assuming the initial point"".

"Holy suit this is a lot of text. I must have hit a nerve.

&gt;Rewrite history much?

&gt;BTC+Segwit had consensus or it would never have activated.

The fact that the network split means there was not consensus. Some miners left Bitcoin and started mining a new chain. They did this because it was the only way to get bigger blocks.

&gt; It was a soft-fork which was activated by vast majority of the network.

What was left of the network after a portion left and went to BCH

&gt;BCH is just a random alt-coin that Roger Ver launched and had a premine of the initial UTXO set. 

I think it was ABC that coded it, but it shares the same history of BTC. If BCH has a premine then so does BTC Segwit.

&gt; Not true. Segwit never would have activated with 20% support. It had an 80% activation threshold.

Rewrite history much? Seg2X had a 80% threshold.

&gt; What you can't do, however, is fraudulently claim it ""is bitcoin"" which it is not.

You don't get to decide what is and is not Bitcoin. It is decided by the white paper. P2P electronic cash, not a bank settlement layer.

&gt; There is no 'code' associated with a fee market. 

Keeping the block size at 1 meg and introducing RBF does.

&gt; RBF, segwit, are both optional soft-fork features which were activated with super-majority consensus of the network.

They are also not part of the original design and Segwit is bad code. 

If the majority of the network decided to ditch Segwit and take the money, what then? Is that optional in your opinion?

&gt; It added not only an EDA, but also increased the blocksize, 

That's part of the original design. Its not a new feature but an old one. 

&gt; defaced the source code by removing RBF and segwit

I thought those were optional. RBF decreases the security, so that a bonus. Segwit wasn't removed as it wasn't implemented yet.

&gt; It is now introducing new opcodes.

Old op codes

&gt; Every day it is becoming a wild-west exercise in software development, so centralized that it hard-forks at will.

3 development teams is far less centralized then 1. Hard forks are good, upgrading the network is good. Bitcoin has had several in the past and we need to make up for the last 3 years of stagnation.

&gt; That is not a fact. The chain which did not hard-fork away retains the exchange token.

Who cares about the exchange token? I got into this to remove the financial elite and you think they should decide who owns the name? Open source project, no owners, that's the point.

&gt; There is absolutely zero difference between BCH and bitcoin gold and other bitcoin hard-forks. 

Then why does Bitcoin Gold get to keep Bitcoin in its name and Bitcoin Cash does not? Not very consistent.

&gt; I disagree. I think for Roger it's all about his own ego and power over the bitcoin network. He may not be able to admit that to himself. In fact, I'm willing to grant that maybe he believes he is 'sincere in his beliefs' but his actions speak much louder than his words.

This Roger hate isn't healthy. I see no evidence of his control over the network. I do however see an insane amount of control over BTC wielded by the core devs. They have even claimed that consensus cannot be reached without their approval. Kettle pot black.",1524613460

If you want the higher returns, it comes with a higher risk of course.

I will tell you a few projects I myself consider to be very interesting and promising. I will rank them in the order of risk, ranking the safest option first.

1. Request Network,  currently ranked 103 on coinmarketcap. Aims to be the paypal of crypto + more. (it's a platform for payment requests) it has a lot of projects in development and a very professional team. They received backing from THE startup incubator in sillicon valley Y Combinator.

2. Masari, currently in the process of being listed on coinmarketcap, it's a very new project, aiming to be the little brother of Monero (similar to how Litecoin is to Bitcoin). I believe privacy coins are going to be very popular in the coming years. Masari wants to have features implemented to itself, before potentially being adopted by Monero. The community is really active, and it has grown to about 5 million in market cap (which is very low).

3. Xtrabytes (ranked 263 on coinmarketcap), could be a complete scam or a revolutionary project. Aiming to be a 10k+ Txs code agnostic Dapps platform (essentially Ethereum 3.0). However their team is currently anonymous, and no proof of coe exist. They claim to wait for a patent to be approved before they release the code, so no forks can occur. a VERY high risk.

"This is a variation of the same basic question: 

""Which strategy is better right now, buy and hold, or buy the dip?""

I've seen analyses that argue for both side of this, in stocks and in crypto.  

The tradeoff is between volatility and growth.  The more volatile a particular asset - as defined by the strength of price movements and reversals - the better a ""buy the dip"" strategy is, because it allows you to take profits from that volatility.  The cost of doing that is the potential to lose out on the growth that results from big, sudden runs.  In other words, if you're tethering the day BTC jumps a lot, you kick yourself...

Look at December 7, 2017.  BTC rose from $13,500 to $16,600 in one day.  It can happen.

I think right now, in such a rapidly snowballing market, buy and hold is a better strategy than buy the dip.  Because I think the probability of another 12/7/17 happening on any given day is sufficiently high as to make the opportunity cost too high for scalping.

But if you're in a position where the money matters to you - especially if you're using leverage of some sort - you might consider selling a small portion of your position back into USD and keeping it there.  And continuing to do so as the market rises.

If you're in a position where the money isn't important to you in the short term, I'd just hodl.  Being on the ride is more fun than watching it.",1524612296
"Yes for receive addresses. No for spend, that’s the basis of the devices security. 

You can safely post your receive address on the web, in your signature or Anywhere. It can accept payments forever. 

In order to spend you need the private key. Which is held on the Nano. That key is never displayed, even to you. 

Bitcoin (and most others) operate with 3 keys. 
1. Public address / receive key 
2. Public view key (see balance) 
3. Private key or spend key 

You must posses the spend key in order to have full control over your coins. Hence the phrase “not your key, not your coins”. 

This is why you never leaves coins on any exchange. Because they hold the spend key. 

Nano is so secure that if there is an airdrop you will not get the rewards. This becomes a good argument for paper key. ",1524612257

"&gt;&gt;Neither BTC+Segwit or BTC+DAA had consensus, thus the split. 

Rewrite history much?  

BTC+Segwit had consensus or it would never have activated.

It was a soft-fork which was activated by vast majority of the network. 

BCH is just a random alt-coin that Roger Ver launched and had a premine of the initial UTXO set. 


&gt;&gt;Segwit had about 20% support iirc whereas bigger blocks hit about 40%. 

Not true.  Segwit never would have activated with 20% support. It had an 80% activation threshold.


&gt;&gt;The community has been deeply divided on this issue for a while and decided to go its separate ways. 

This is true.  A minority of the community created an alt-coin called BCH.  They are welcome to their alt-coin, just as Dogecoin, Litecoin, and many other forks of bitcoin have existed for years.

What you can't do, however, is fraudulently claim it ""is bitcoin"" which it is not.

&gt;Did you not know that?

I know you are repeating falsehoods and I am correcting them.

&gt;&gt;BTC has added hacked up code (RBF, Segwit, and a fee market),

There is no 'code' associated with a fee market.  RBF, segwit, are both optional soft-fork features which were activated with super-majority consensus of the network.

The code was extensively tested and peer reviewed. There was nothing hacked about it.

&gt; whereas BCH has added a difficulty adjustment algorithm. 

It added not only an EDA, but also increased the blocksize, defaced the source code by removing RBF and segwit.  It is now introducing new opcodes.  Every day it is becoming a wild-west exercise in software development, so centralized that it hard-forks at will.

&gt;Fact is neither chain owns the name Bitcoin and both can claim it without fraud.

That is not a fact.  The chain which did not hard-fork away retains the exchange token.  There is absolutely zero difference between BCH and bitcoin gold and other bitcoin hard-forks.  They are all just alt-coins which have just as much right to exist, I suppose, as any other alt-coin.  They cannot, however, 'claim to be bitcoin', because that is not true.  And to do so is fraudulent behavior.

&gt;&gt;Roger, despite his flaws, is sincere in his beliefs. Do you disagree?

I disagree.  I think for Roger it's all about his own ego and power over the bitcoin network.  He may not be able to admit that to himself.  In fact, I'm willing to grant that maybe he believes he is 'sincere in his beliefs' but his actions speak much louder than his words.

Bitcoin.com is owned by Ver, and calling bcash Bitcoin so that new users will buy it instead of real Bitcoin is theft. Bcash is an altcoin, and it's not what anyone wants when they're trying to get into the space.

Pretty much but so what. Most stocks don’t earn dividends either. You enter and exit a position low and hope to exit high. Revenue a company makes is just one metric one utilizes to determine if it’s a good or bad time to enter or exit such position.  Crypto is just less predictable is all. So higher risk due to high volatility but potential for higher gain. ,1524608805

"&gt;Trying to say that the 2FA on an exchange is a safer route.

It's not. First of all 2FA wouldn't have saved anyone from MtGox. It's not only individual accounts which can be compromised, but the entire exchange can have a problem (such as assets being frozen by govt as happened to BTC-e). Second, I read about a user on LocalBitcoins.com who just knew he was safe having his 2FA enabled, only to return months later to find a zero balance. The best explanation we in the forum could come up with was an attacker got his email/pass somehow (eg malware), then contacted LBC support requesting 2FA be disabled maybe saying their phone was lost. After a 2 week interval I think LBC would allow the 2FA to be disabled. I'm not sure this was their policy or what happened but I remember this proposed as a theory. There was also the story of the guy losing 30K I think it was from Coinbase because their 2FA is sending an SMS phone message, but the attacker upon getting the victim's phone number social engineered a Verizon support rep to change their number to the attacker's phone. So 2FA was defeated again. It provides a false sense of security. There is also the possibility of a phishing site gaining a 2FA credential and using it elsewhere.

&gt;This includes, but isn't limited to: Coinbase...

One thing I would say is a large company like Coinbase can generally be thought of as secure, although I'd still keep balances limited. They have insurance and usually top notch security experts. What I do recommend is holding *limited* amounts on *different* exchanges. In this way it's unlikely you lose any giant sum when some unexpected unfortunate situation arises. Hardware wallets are still the recommended option for easy security of large amounts, though. They are purpose specific.",1524608730

The anti-bch trolls are going to crop out but when there are two versions of Bitcoin in the top 10 and some valid supporters of Bitcoin Cash you have to really ask yourself really which Bitcoin so this no longer makes it the safest bet in my opinion.

I could go full crypto nerd rn but i have finals to study for, so heres the gist. 

Bitcoins original intention was to be a transactional currency, but as it got larger and larger the network became too slow and the orginial dev team couldnt fix it because the miners pretty much controlled it and were abusing their power to drive transaction fees way up. Thus born BCH in an attempt to revitalize BTC original goal as stated in the the white paper. Im not saying BTC is bad as a store of value which it is used for now, but looking at it in terms of what it was meant to do its trash. They will both continue to exist as long as miners can profit from them. I do not like Ver he is a douche and gives BCH a bad name, but what no one seems to realize is he does not control BCH the miners do, he is just a BCH advocate. And yea he may have been able to load up on it because he was in contact with the dev team and knew what they were trying to do and trying do and capitalize on it like anyone would. 

No one seems to understand that BCH isnt a scam by ver. He just knew what the dev team was trying to do and capitalized on it and he's trying to get other ppl to follow to bch so that all the miners switch to the bch protocol like what was originally intended with this fork, but half of  miners choose not to because at the time btc was still more profitable.

The scaling debate had been an issue brought up years prior to hitting the ceiling and was ignored by Blockstream.. I guess you most certainly were not in any kind of rush last year, nor this year with the current development.

&gt;Satoshi did not mean to do increase the block size at block 114000, or whatever the exact number was. That was just an example.

The point being, there was a scaling solution set in place by SN, that was completely ignored on false premises in favor for a nonexistent system at the time.

&gt;This was not known to Satoshi at the beginning, and is one of the reasons for keeping the blocks small, to have that fee market.

You mean to tell me the great SN was smart enough to foresee the majority of the more complex issues with BTC to this day, but SN wasn’t smart enough to foresee the day that the system they built would hit the coin distribution ceiling?

&gt;No it cannot, because

Because.........

&gt;that is only true until the next coding clusterfuck. What if you're a merchant who sold a lambo, and then the random Vitalik of your choice decides to roll back to recover some funds? All of a sudden your payment is gone... but so is the lambo! Yes, you can chase the buyer, but that might end up being extremely lengthy AND costly.

This is 100% avoidable if the applications built on top of the protocol are bounded by the foundations of said protocol that do not allow such clusterfuck coding.

2) walton hires some new marketing people
3) they come up with a free giveaway to create a buzz
4) it backfires massively because someone doing Walton's marketing also participated in the free give away.
5) The crypto community goes absolutely nuts over this. Somehow the 2.14 fiasco got more attention and votes than even the most popular Bitconnect topic. Does that seem fair or fishy ?)
6) some people become convinced an exit scam is coming or ""worst"" and sell.
7) some people decide to invest / hold
8) walton continues to meet the deadlines in their roadmap and demonstrates its legitimacy.
9) some people who convinced themselves an exit scam was imminent are having a hard time admitting they were wrong.

Yes, i'm telling you the WTC team had an incompetent marketing team. They made a mistake, but they seem to be doing a much much better Job now.

In a way you should think of it as a good option. Consider that all this skepticism has kept WTC's price artificially low.

"There's a whitepaper draft [here](https://github.com/particl/whitepaper/blob/master/decentralized-private-marketplace-draft-0.1.pdf). [Here](https://particl.wiki/marketplace) you can find more information about the marketplace's features. Also, [here](https://particl.wiki/infographics_mpkeypoints) you will find an infographic of the marketplace's key points. Basically, the Particl marketplace will be a place where users can buy, sell and trade any goods and services without relying on any third-party (including for the escrow system which is based on MAD and can be used at no fee (except normal PART transaction fees)). Additionally, the marketplace will route every marketplace transactions through the RingCT protocol which makes every mp transactions private by default. Note that Particl is Bitcoin-based, not Cryptonote-based like all the other RingCT chains. Another sweet feature will be the possibility to use almost any coin to purchase items. Particl is atomic swap-enabled since 2017 and plans on having a complete [in-wallet integration](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DWs2hGqU8AAK-TC.jpg) (other wireframe [here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DWs2hp4VwAEXYoE.jpg) ) of atomic swap trading. Particl can also integrate any third-party such as Changelly Shapeshift to widen the number of currencies that can be accepted on the Particl marketplace. The good stuff is that even though you could buy something with Bitcoin, for example, your BTC transaction would be automatically transfered into PART so that the marketplace can use the RingCT protocol of its native currency as well as the escrow smart-contract. So while you can buy anything with your currency of choice, that still generates demand for the coin. Another dealbreaker (at least, for me it was when I first heard of it) is that 100% of the fees generated by the marketplace (as well as the other future dApps) are redistributed to the Particl stakers. That adds up on top of the scheduled inflation/staking rate as well as transaction fees. The marketplace itself is moderated by the community, not any central authority. Content rejected by the community is purged off the blockchain entirely. There is, however, the possibility to have private listings/markets that cannot be moderated. This would literally be like buying an item in-person and paid by cash. Also, for scalability purposes, the team is looking into integrating Bulletproofs later this year or early next year. That would make RingCT and CT transactions much smaller. Data storage (such as listing images) are stored off-chain on what we call DSNs (data storage networks). Our own native DSN is [SMSG](https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/data-storage-network/smsg.html), a P2P message mixnet running parallel with the Particl network. Note that the page I have just linked you to is a bit outdated. For example, messages are not stored for a maximum of 48 hours anymore. They are stored for a period determined by the fees paid by the user. SMSG can store messages (we have a messaging system in CLI mode), but also can store images and othe types of data, which is how it is used by the marketplace. ",1524607035

Whilst the blockchain tech itself is secure (in that its trustless, proven to be ""unhackable"" and more than likely will never go away) if you can't use it without all the other related tech (and you can't) it is still no better; the same scams, hacks, cheats, vulnerabilities etc are all still possible in both ecosystems. That crypto also pushes most security responsibility on individual consumers instead of relying on centralized institutions it actually makes it more vulnerable overall and less secure. The success of this DNS attack is proof of that, these people made fairly basic mistakes and lost their ETH. It's not Ethereum's fault, it did what it was supposed to but that ETH is now owned by someone else and it can't be refunded to me, whereas the same mistakes and same attack on my banks website I would get that money back.

The expectations on the end user are currently higher with crypto, the reward for the attacker is high and risk to the attacker is currently low.

"I understand your point of view but let's be clear here, there's no such thing as an existing definition of the real bitcoin.

To crazy Roger and his fans his fork with bigger blocks with bigger capacity is a real bitcoin, closer to a white paper vision a peer to peer cash.

To many people here bitcoin btc is a real bitcoin, with smaller blocks potentially less susceptible to centralization. Fundamentally they're both correct because there is no absolute definition, it's all about perspective. Now of course more people believe in BTC than in BCH but what if today someone made a fork and the network would split 50/50? Which one would be the real bitcoin? Who gets to decide that and why? What if the split would go in 3 distinctive ways because of some community split or development arguments and all of the new networks would get approximately 1/3 of the market share? Would Chain A, B or C be a real bitcoin and why? Or maybe the previous BCH? 

That would depend entirely on the people who chose one network over the other. This is why unlike people who are very attached to their favorite crypto brand in my opinion this is fine. Why? People who put their trust in BCH may truly believe that saving people from putting money in fake bitcoin (btc) is a good thing to do because BCH is better and more useful. Meanwhile BTC fans will believe that protecting people from fake bitcoin (bch) pretending to be ""real"" bitcoin is the right thing to do because BTC is better. I know that many people will argue here that the scummy moves and misleading practices of Roger are bad and he is on the wrong side of history but once again, pretend for a minute that you believe that BCH vision is much better, in such case fighting the ""core"" with anything you've got would be the right thing to do.

People who are emotionally or financially invested in one of those will often defend their beliefs to the death and deny the other group their position. I on the other hand believe there is no fundamental absolute truth which chain is the truest one and both groups have the right to claim they are correct and the degree of their success should be determined by the consensus of people not some powerful organisation that will impede them one way or another just because some people complained about them. By asking some authority to intervene they are taking the ability of the people to decide and that is not decentralization. 

Like that twitter shutdown. People were cheering that the Twitter has shut down bitcoin account (which is presumably controlled by BCH people) and this was wrong in my opinion. When a centralized entity takes power from your opponent it may be convenient but it is a hypocrisy to cheer because when the same thing would happen to you you'd be crying about your ruined decentralization dreams.

I know right?  Is it gonna go up 1,500% this year or 10,000%?  So volatile!

Anyway, big institutions are already moving money from gold and such into bitcoin.  So, they seem to think it can store their billions just fine.

&gt; 3. Thing in Itself. A bitcoin has no intrinsic value.

For the first time in history, you can send any amount of money to anyone in the world, in seconds (LN), practically for free, and it can't be reversed or disputed.  AND, you can store any amount in your own head if you want to!

"Enrironmental Scientist, Geochemist, checking in. I am working on the Envirnmental Case for Bitcoin and POW. Some quick points: Energy use is not the problem it's how is the energy produced. Bitcoin/POW incentivizes the use of the cheapest energy, and fossil fuels can't compete with green tech (solar, wind, hydro, nuclear, geothermal, OTEC, wave, etc.) for much longer. Competition for mining power will lead to proliferation of green energy infrastructure across the globe as mining can be participated in from anywhere, think space race except for remaking the energy grid. Inflation requires continuous growth in consumption, resource use, and enviromental exploitation, deflation may alow growth without increased consumption. The US is dragging it's feet with climate action because of ties to Saudi Arabia and Oil pricing in dollars and because the Oil infrastructure was built with loans that need to be paid back (politicians on the take from banks and oil companies), weakening oil reliance = weakening the dollar and potential default on loans from outstanding debt, Bitcoin/POW can weaken oil and the banks expediating the transition.

"This is a huge misconception. You need to look at it when you equalize the units when compared to other crypto projects. (for some reason people ignore the decimal points in other projects) If people actually did the research they would realize the total supply per unit is actual only 33% larger than Bitcoins and owning a single GiOTA (1000 MIOTA) is MUCH MUCH scarcer than bitcoins since only 2.7 million will ever exist.

To compare apples against apples, let’s compute the respective smallest unit value and then let’s compare the relative “scarcity” of Bitcoin vs IOTA as per attached table:

As shown in the table, there is 32% more supply of IOTAs but the current price of their respective smallest units is 4,890% more in favor of Satoshis or Bitcoin!

For Example
2.779.530.283.000.000 IOTA
2.100.000.000.000.000 Satishi

https://imgur.com/yVut5M0

The below table shows the relative supply and prices of ETH, XRP and IOTA against BTC.

It shows that 1 BTC = 4,762 XRP = 4.71 ETH* = 132.36 MIOTA (*Note: ETH has no hard cap supply).

Thus using current prices, 1 BTC that is worth $9,244 = $4,320 worth of XRP = $3,212 worth of ETH = $287 worth of MIOTA.

But percentage wise compared to BTC price, we can see that the equivalent quantity of XRP is currently 47% of one BTC; ETH at 35%; and MIOTA at only 3% of one BTC.

Here is a unit equalized table for other coins

Also, it seems to me, we should not pay too much attention to what governments think of bitcoin \(we don't need to let that guide us \-\- we need to take the reins ourselves so that governments will eventually follow along\), although as I have argued repeatedly before, we need to be waging a battle against bitlicense proposals both with [legal / legislative advocacy](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8dmi30/so_youre_bullish_on_bitcoin_and_stoked_that/) and also with [technological privacy improvements](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8e0gwo/have_you_contributed_to_bitcoin_privacy_lately/).

We should advocate for approaches such as that in Slovenia, where as of 2018, bitcoin is not discriminated against and is treated properly  for the most part. Look up ""Legality of bitcoin by country or  territory"" \~ Slovenia's approach is reasonable in stating bitcoin is  neither a currency or asset. Which is correct, because it is not.

"As we edge closer to 10k again, and the land of real FOMO, let me remind you of a magical time we saw a lot in November/December of last year and haven't seen a lot since then.

As a result, your portfolio will see a lot of Red again for while, simply because Bitcoin is taking up all the market's space, so to speak. 

Don't worry too much about it - But as a temporary thing, once Bitcoin reaches whatever stage it needs to be and goes sideways for a bit, **that** is when the real alt explosion will happen, as everyone consolidates all the profit they got from Bitcoin into alts that haven't moved yet or are due for an upswing.

You seem to believe there are ""opt in"" soft forks and ""non opt in"" soft forks. That's not the case. Every fork is, by definition, opt in. If you use the updated client you'll take advantage of the new features, but you don't have to, and you'll still be good to go. (Of course, at least 51% of the miners must be on-board.)

&gt;why wouldn’t you implement those “soft-forks” as a hard-fork.

Less disruption. Also because there's people are not fighting to use cryptos, aka we were not in a rush last year.

&gt;Tell the whole story... As a temporary measure, and even provided specific dialog on how to raise the blocksize for scaling.

Yes, and blocks will become larger, when other optimizations are not sufficient anymore. And no, Satoshi did not mean to do increase the block size at block 114000, or whatever the exact number was. That was just an example.

&gt;Hello, the original vision for the Bitcoin protocol was to be a currency system for the entire world, blocks should not be getting full and fees should not be so high that it defeats the entire purpose of using the protocol as currency.

New research emerged which highlighted the problems Bitcoin will face when the block reward is no more. (Google ""On the instability of Bitcoin in the absence of block reward"".) This was not known to Satoshi at the beginning, and is one of the reasons for keeping the blocks small, to have that fee market.

&gt;You do realize the greater picture that Bitcoin can be both, 

No it cannot, because

&gt;just as some use Ethereum for currency.

that is only true until the next coding clusterfuck. What if you're a merchant who sold a lambo, and then the random Vitalik of your choice decides to roll back to recover some funds? All of a sudden your payment is gone... but so is the lambo! Yes, you can chase the buyer, but that might end up being extremely lengthy AND costly.

Bitcoin = Money, period.

&gt;The point is to have an endless ecosystem of all different types of applications using the base protocol as the currency to power such applications. That ideology is much more powerful than having 1,000 different incompatible currencies.

Welcome sidechains and Rootstock (RSK). If you don't know it, you should Google it. You can make whatever coding clusterfuck on the RSK chain, and it **won't impact Bitcoin at all**!!!


&gt;Let me guess.. limit the potential of layer 1, create a layer 2 to undermine layer 1, through the use routing that is more complex than unsolved BGP routing, then move the majority of the very mining fees that create economic incentive to secure the network to that layer 2 in the form of hub-and-spoke, effectively creating the federal reserve 2.0.

The Bitcoin Core (BTC) network is in trouble due to high fees and slow transaction times. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is the upgrade that solves these problems.

Right next to it is a link to ""learn more about bitcoin cash"" - on the bitcoin.com website. If you're completely new to crypto you'll be greeted with this:

&gt; This guide will help explain the difference between the two most popular versions of Bitcoin: Bitcoin Cash ($BCH) and Bitcoin Core ($BTC).

And the jumps are huge over short bursts. I'm only looking at the charts on gdax. That isn't the sum total of the market so what's going on? Are a few big players moving a lot of money to decieve the eager? It's one thing if an exchange lags behind the others and so huge orders come in from cross exchange profiteers when a lot of demand is unmet. It's another if it's a whale forcing such an event.

"Interesting question (I assume rhetorical?). If he did, he'd probably live to see himself become the villain.

&amp;nbsp;

However, I would like others to read this BitcoinTalk post of his written back in 2010. From what I can tell, it seems as if he was advocating for second-layer solutions. This actually makes answering the above question more difficult.

&gt; Actually there is a very good reason for Bitcoin-backed banks to exist, issuing their own digital cash currency, redeemable for bitcoins. Bitcoin itself cannot scale to have every single financial transaction in the world be broadcast to everyone and included in the block chain. There needs to be a secondary level of payment systems which is lighter weight and more efficient. Likewise, the time needed for Bitcoin transactions to finalize will be impractical for medium to large value purchases.

Bitcoin backed banks will solve these problems. They can work like banks did before nationalization of currency. Different banks can have different policies, some more aggressive, some more conservative. Some would be fractional reserve while others may be 100% Bitcoin backed. Interest rates may vary. Cash from some banks may trade at a discount to that from others.

George Selgin has worked out the theory of competitive free banking in detail, and he argues that such a system would be stable, inflation resistant and self-regulating.

I believe this will be the ultimate fate of Bitcoin, to be the ""high-powered money"" that serves as a reserve currency for banks that issue their own digital cash. Most Bitcoin transactions will occur between banks, to settle net transfers. Bitcoin transactions by private individuals will be as rare as... well, as Bitcoin based purchases are today.",1524602680

Now the marketvalue of the tokens is10$, we're all of the sudden at a marketcap of 1000$, instead of the previous 100$. 

Yet - I've only bought tokens for a total of 50$, and for simplicity sake lets say everyone else bought at a static price of 10$. 

That would mean that only 550$ has been invested, but the marketcap is at 1000.

However, in crypto there's probably even less than 55% of actual money invested. I'd say it's around 10%, but i got no stats to back that up (CBA looking it up).

"Holding is good, and I may be wrong in what I’m about to say, but I think it’s important to have information and knowledge to be prepared for a big market dip. I will explain why. 
The mistake I made was to watch my investment grow 10x and then hold on to it and watch it leak back to where I started in the first place. Yes I still had the same amount of crypto currency, but if I had listened to others who were selling and putting there holdings temporarily back into fiat and bought back in I would now have 5x to 10x more cryptos. 
I know hindsight is an exact science, but when you see the TA from the last bitcoin run up there was no support and it had to correct. 
I didn’t lose any cryptocurrency and I didn’t lose anything on my initial fiat investment. What I made in profits I lost l, and it wasn’t a small amount. 

I will not be doing the same in the future.  

Holding in my opinion does not apply to all situations. Yes I agree holding is good through small dips etc. But when it goes parabolic it makes no sense to just hold it all the way back down to the bottom. 

I think we all strive in life to do the best for ourselves and for family etc.  In a market that can drop 70+% to me it only makes sense to hold it to as close to the top as you can, sell and then buy back in as close to the bottom as you can. ",1524602318

"True, but he did send 25k btc to bittrex and hasn't returned them. No doubt that he's still very rich. ",1524601991
"There's a whitepaper draft [here](https://github.com/particl/whitepaper/blob/master/decentralized-private-marketplace-draft-0.1.pdf).

[Here](https://particl.wiki/marketplace) you can find more information about the marketplace's features.

Also, [here](https://particl.wiki/infographics_mpkeypoints) you will find an infographic of the marketplace's key points. 

Basically, the Particl marketplace will be a place where users can buy, sell and trade any goods and services without relying on any third-party (including for the escrow system which is based on MAD and can be used at no fee (except normal PART transaction fees)). Additionally, the marketplace will route every marketplace transactions through the RingCT protocol which makes every mp transactions private by default. Note that Particl is Bitcoin-based, not Cryptonote-based like all the other RingCT chains. 

Another sweet feature will be the possibility to use almost any coin to purchase items. Particl is atomic swap-enabled since 2017 and plans on having a complete [in-wallet integration](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DWs2hGqU8AAK-TC.jpg) (other wireframe [here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DWs2hp4VwAEXYoE.jpg) ) of atomic swap trading. Particl can also integrate any third-party such as Changelly Shapeshift to widen the number of currencies that can be accepted on the Particl marketplace. The good stuff is that even though you could buy something with Bitcoin, for example, your BTC transaction would be automatically transfered into PART so that the marketplace can use the RingCT protocol of its native currency as well as the escrow smart-contract. So while you can buy anything with your currency of choice, that still generates demand for the coin.

Another dealbreaker (at least, for me it was when I first heard of it) is that 100% of the fees generated by the marketplace (as well as the other future dApps) are redistributed to the Particl stakers. That adds up on top of the scheduled inflation/staking rate as well as transaction fees. 

The marketplace itself is moderated by the community, not any central authority. Content rejected by the community is purged off the blockchain entirely. There is, however, the possibility to have private listings/markets that cannot be moderated. This would literally be like buying an item in-person and paid by cash. 

Also, for scalability purposes, the team is looking into integrating Bulletproofs later this year or early next year. That would make RingCT and CT transactions much smaller. Data storage (such as listing images) are stored off-chain on what we call DSNs (data storage networks). Our own native DSN is [SMSG](https://kewde.gitbooks.io/protocol/content/data-storage-network/smsg.html), a P2P message mixnet running parallel with the Particl network. Note that the page I have just linked you to is a bit outdated. For example, messages are not stored for a maximum of 48 hours anymore. They are stored for a period determined by the fees paid by the user. SMSG can store messages (we have a messaging system in CLI mode), but also can store images and othe types of data, which is how it is used by the marketplace. ",1524601978
"They are labeling bch as Bitcoin and btc as Bitcoin Core. 

I just don’t see how that seems like a good move aside from the fact that the number of people who are confused and buying something other than what they intended and complain about it, vs the number of people who are confused and buy something other than what they intended and don’t complain is an acceptable ratio to Ver, because it will keep the trend of ‘adoption’ climbing and he can get more out of bch before he bails than if he didn’t do stuff like this.

The worst part is that BCH has its own value and can rise and increase adoption on its own merits without this shady crap.  Ver is very much not ignoring the fact that people see ‘Bitcoin’ on the news at nearly $10,000, and all their friend talking about it over the years, and then go to bitcoin.com and see Bitcoin selling for a fraction of that, and thinking they’ll get a steal.

"Bcore is controlled by a for-profit business called Blockstream - they will never allow a block size increase, in fact it's much more likely the block size will eventually shrink to ensure users are forced onto their proprietary payment network (after their false flag called the LN is declared a failure of course).

"I agree with your first criticism... I don't think that BCH is Roger Ver's project in the sense that he founded it... I'm sure he meant that in the sense that it is something he currently supports and works on. Sorry I should have been more clear on that.

Regarding the BCH Wikipedia entry I've read that before and it's certainly isn't very clear on the timeline and neither is the info in your comment. Bitcoin XT forked the software in 2015, with both Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited implementations following soon after. These were all precursors to bitcoin cash and attempts by big block supporters to scale Bitcoin by increasing the block size. It's important to note that none of them received majority usage by mining nodes. I point this out because it is an important indicator that big block supporters were never able to gain consensus around their proposed scaling methods. 

It's common to hear now from BCH supporters that scaling was blocked by a ""Blockcore Bilderberg cabal"" when in actuality they have never been able to achieve majority support from all areas of the community. Bitcoin Cash is a response to the inability to achieve change by convincing the community. It's supporters hard forked and created a new chain with different rules than the main chain. They chose to stop trying to build support from within the community and are now attempting to work from outside Bitcoin to take it over.

Regarding Segwit2x that had its roots in the Hong Kong agreement which generally had support of many core developers. By the following year and the New Year's Eve agreement it had almost no support of core developers as consensus had started to build around shaking by layers. Segwit2x also explicitly aimed to remove commit access from the core developers and put it in the hands of Jeff Garzik and whomever was backing him so the idea that core developers were going to whole heartedly support that is kind of silly.

"&gt;I was on their side for a considerable amount of time. I was in the bitcoin game early on when it was all ""freedom and decentralization and libertarian festivals and down with the big banks the internet of money is going to help everyone out of poverty! Everyone can be their own bank! Alpaca socks!""

I don't think you were early if this is what was happening. I've been involved in some way or another since 2010, and back then, bitcoin wasn't decentralization, libertarians, or freedom. 

the only goal that was common among everyone back then was transparency. Mainly because the opaqueness of the banking industry is what exacerbated the 2007-2009 housing crash. 

&gt;I'm paraphrasing of course, but fees continued to climb. And the community's focus had changed. And even back in 2015 everyone was blindly hyping some apparent vaporware 'lightning network' which, back then, everyone insisted was ""Just around the corner!"" and ""Lightning Network will fix this! It'll fix everything! We promise! I saw a YouTube video on it once!"", when just increasing the damn block size like Satoshi had left as an option seemed like it would immediately result in lowering fees back to economically moot levels like they had been originally.

You're missing the point here though. While fees increasing is a very real problem, the solution you take to dealing with them is important. 

Increasing the block size inevitably leads to a concentration in mining power, because the hardware required to stay competitive increases as block size increases. While this decentralization effect is not particularly important to bitcoins future on it's own, the effects it creates are extremely important. 

As concentration of mining increase, so does concentration of bitcoin wealth. As fewer and fewer parties have control over more and more bitcoin, incentives become perverse. Similar to how monopolistic firms cause deadweight loss in ecomomics due to pricing issues. 

A system of ever increasing block sizes will inevitably cause perverse incentives; that is, incentives that encourage reducing transparency. Which, undeniably, IS the main focus of bitcoin, whether you view it as a currency, or as a store of value. 

If bitcoin doesn't do its job as a transparent and secure currency, the fees are inconsequential. They could be zero, and nobody would use the coin. 

bitcoin cash as a solution would be like your doctor putting a band-aid on your tongue because you have herpes. it does nothing to fix the core problem, nor prevent future problems associated with it. It just looks better until the band-aid falls off. ",1524601650

If they were to add 10 new (ERC-20) tokens, then yes maybe BAT could be one of them, but why would they add a token with a very specific function in a very specific ecosystem when the others on Coinbase are currency coins?  I think it's more likely they add other platform tokens like NEO, ICX, etc.  I don't see how someone can look at this objectively and think BAT is going to be THE NEXT TOKEN added. Also, yes, the CEO tweeted about it over a year ago.  Since then, crypto has gone through a HUGE transformation.  ",1524601596
"Even relative to sat value alt-coin performance has been really good. 

Compared to Last month when BTC was down, but everything else was totally dumpstered.

Pretty obvious because while the market cap has been rising, the BTC dominance has been dropping (it was above 40%, now closer to 37%). 

If the bull run continues I expect new money coming into BTC, with the whales jumping on for the ride which will drop alts (hopefully not too much). These gains will then be invested in the alts again in a similar europhic run to late dec / early Jan. 

Though this is purely retail behaviour, if the money is institutional then things will be more stable and growing the top coins mainly (top 3-5). Whales will probably park these gains into the alts, though at a slower rate. 

Steady growth is way more better than these crazy boom / bust cycles purely driven by retail traders with the attention span of flies. ",1524601576

"BTC might come with some flaws. The blocksize and the fees are ridiculous. BCH proposed a good answer to that, but without doing the research I'm going to assume BCH isn't flooded with the same amount of txs as BTC. It peaked somewhere around 25-30% of BTCs value, although some charts read closer to 50% which was short lived and might have been an misclick on an exchange - if you blinked, you missed it. That is quite an impressive feat in itself but with the amount of propoganda and agenda-pushing for BCH, it's obvious that its meant to profit a select few who are deeply invested in BCH. I think the biggest thing is to respect the consensus, the mining hashrate which you have to also consider that the difficulty being lower on BCH and price bursts are going to have profitability miners temporarily giving BCH a boost in hashrate here and there. If I had to bet on it, I'd obviously stick with BTC over BCH, but it doesn't make much difference to me since I hold the same small amount of both.. I'm like 95% in altcoins anyway. ",1524601486

"Hi. 
Michael Perklin here, board member of TBF.

First, I have to correct a quite a few inaccuracies that you made in your post which seem to have lead you to inaccurate conclusions. 

First, while it’s true that Llew (our Executive Director) is a colleague of Vinny, it’s untrue to claim that the entire board has been taken over by BCH supporters. 
I am a technology supporter and believe there is a place for both chains (I support both). Other board members are BTC-only supporters and vehemently oppose BCH, and I have no idea of Vinny is a BCH-only supporter but even if he is, there are a wide array of viewpoints from the board. 

Next, Llew is not a board member and does not have the ability to vote on board resolutions.

Third, your claim that TBF has “a substantial budget” is entirely incorrect, and you acknowledge this yourself towards the bottom of your post where you say that bitcoin has a PR budget of 0. This is the truth. TBF has 0 budget for public relations. 

Finally, while your claims about Roger are true (he IS mounting a PR campaign), that fact has nothing to do with TBF. It would be equally relevant to TBF’s recent update email to cite Elon Musk’s recent work on automotive construction. While it’s a notable fact, neither the man nor the fact have any relevance to The Bitcoin Foundation at this time.

"A hard fork copies the blockchain and creates a different currency (this doubles the coins), after that both blockchains/currencies coexist. The community tried to implement bigger blocks in Bitcoin without a hard fork, but they didn't get enough votes. Thats why Bitcoin Cash hard forked from Bitcoin to use a bigger blocksize of 8MB instead of 1MB in Bitcoin. This allows more transactions to be saved in a single block. 

When Bitcoin had its highest price the 1MB blocks were always full and it took hours or days to complete a transaction. Imo this shows that the bigger blocksize was definitly needed, but sadly wasn't implemented in Bitcoin.",1524600992
"The difficulty makes mining harder and ensures that a new block is mined every 10 minutes on average. BTC has a blocksize of 1MB as opposed to BCH's 8MB, so naturally BCH's blockchain can deal with more transactions in the same time. The problem with a bigger blocksize is that the entire blockchain becomes larger (naturally), so storing and propagating (bandwidth) becomes more expensive. If running a node becomes more expensive, then simple economics will tell us, that fewer people run nodes which decreases decentralization. Maximum decentralization isn't always best though, so you need to find a balance. In my opinion, although raising blocksize to 8MB is not a big deal and still decentral enough, it's still only a temporary solution since blocksize scales linearly while usage if adopted will increase exponentially. Given advancements in infrastructure and cheaper technology, BCH may be able to keep on increasing blocksize until adoption stops increasing.

BTC on the other hand tries to scale by trying to offload most transactions to the Lightning Network. Within this peer-to-peer network money can be transferred instantly and free or for a small fee. The details on how this Lightning Network works are very complex and keep on changing. This, too carries some degree of centralization with it (debatable). There is tons I would add to this paragraph if I wasn't so lazy.

"Adoption is not currently happening anyway - people buying gift cards and a few niche sites do not move the needle. So, I think we should focus on building APIs, services, apps etc that allow existing businesses - specially the ones with a ton of users - to integrate Bitcoin Cash. But even to get there safely, we have to guarantee these platforms that their users won't have issues with volatility or private keys. It has to be all so smooth and natural.

By volatility, I mean, the perception of volatility. Let me explain:

Let's say you buy the same cup of coffee each morning, and you pay for it $2.20. You do this for over 3 years, getting ready for your work commute. Even if you paid $2.50 for it recently, the change was so gradual everybody assimilated it with no issues. Also because regular people don't attribute those rising prices to inflation or other economic factors, they just assume ""things get more expensive by time. I remember my grandfather paid a nickle for a cinema ticket...""

And, reason, logic and economics, tell us a different story: that $2.20 price tag fluctuated in value against many other currencies constantly. But again, people don't perceive that. And you know, those currency rates are set by market forces.

The problem is more apparent in some countries such as Venezuela or Argentina, but people are the same everywhere: if you make them buy something they don't understand and don't know how to properly use or store, they will finally stop trusting it. And you have lost that user forever.",1524600263

I’m not confident. It would boil down to making as much profit in the slower months to offset the disparity one would experience by a bull run of that magnitude and that’s where it would be close. 

That’s where short term success can disillusion oneself to the greater reality. So for a six month window of slow steady movement I believe I could again and have.

Bitcoin Cash tries to manage more transactions with bigger 8MB blocks in the blockchain and Bitcoin uses 1MB blocks. Bitcoin also develops the Lightning Network, which does not use the blockchain, to handle more transactions.

That's absurd. The Chinese government doesn't control over 51% of the nodes. It's not like the government of China itself has the hashing power. It's a lot of individual miners in individual pools. Would you be so concerned if the US citizens had over 51% of the hashing power?

"I’m not against soft forks, however, the implementation of Blockstream’s “opt in soft-forks” make it so their protocol will not scale unless you are using the soft-fork implementations. So in essence, since the main reason for the protocol changes was due to the scaling problem, why wouldn’t you implement those “soft-forks” as a hard-fork.

I would assume so you can pretend like you didn’t just completely change the protocol, effectively running a whole different coin disguised as the same ol’ BTC that the users are used to.

&gt;Satoshi implemented the 1MB limit as a soft fork. 

Tell the whole story... As a temporary measure, and even provided specific dialog on how to raise the blocksize for scaling.

&gt;When blocks are not full, Bitcoin works just as in the past, nothing changed.

Hello, the original vision for the Bitcoin protocol was to be a currency system for the *entire* world, blocks should not be getting full and fees should not be so high that it defeats the entire purpose of using the protocol as currency.

Don’t kid yourself, there is no excuse to opt for complex, unproven, buggy (unfinished) code, that includes the potential risk of complete loss of funds, over a simple, proven method that can be easily implemented while you work on your complex system in the background, when in regards to a financial system.

&gt;I want Bitcoin to be used for money, not as the base for all possible DApps in the world,

You do realize the greater picture that Bitcoin can be both, just as some use Ethereum for currency. The point is to have an endless ecosystem of all different types of applications using the base protocol as the currency to power such applications. That ideology is much more powerful than having 1,000 different incompatible currencies.

&gt;All in all... since it was Satoshi that introduced many of the features in place today, including the 1MB limit AND disabling OP codes, I'm not sure BCH is particularly reflective of ""Satoshi's vision"".

Let me guess.. limit the potential of layer 1, create a layer 2 to undermine layer 1, through the use routing that is more complex than unsolved BGP routing, then move the majority of the very mining fees that create economic incentive to secure the network to that layer 2 in the form of hub-and-spoke, effectively creating the federal reserve 2.0. - *Samson*toshi Naka*mow*to.",1524599453

ABC is the leading Bitcoin Cash full node implementation, they've updated their client for the scheduled hard fork upgrade on May 15th. If you are looking to run a full node wallet, you'll want to run one of the latest versions that support that May 15th hard fork, you can pick between ABC, BU, or XT. If you are running a node that is not upgraded for the fork, come the fork time you will not be able to transact on the Bitcoin Cash network, as the previous version will be abandoned. 

Or you can just use an SPV wallet like almost all regular users and not have to worry about devoting the resources to a full node, and it will automatically follow the longest valid chain come the fork. ",1524599351

"Because it fails all 3 functions of money.

1) it is not currently a viable mean of payment. Not everyone accepts it, mostly because;

2) it is not a store of value. Bitcoin is way too volatile to be used as a currency. Imagine if your dollars would lose 40% of their purchasing powe in a week... Only to regain it 2 weeks later. You can become a millionaire and then broke in a few weeks, without changing the numbers in your bank account. And because of that, Bitcoin can't be used as;

3) Unit of account. How can you price something if the value of currency itself changes? You can't price something in Bitcoin because the value of bitcoin itself changes too fast comparatively to everything else. It's a quasi-inflation rollercoaster. When bitcoin loses value, it's inflation, when it gains value, it's deflation. To make long term plans, you need a stable currency, where its value doesn't change. Imagine you own a shop. You want to invest because you think you can make 10% more money if buy whatever. However, there is also the possibility that the money sitting in your pocket will, by itself, value 30% in the same time of your investment. So you don't invest because you're afraid you will lose that potential 30% gain. It becomes impossible to make plans to the future because money won't be usable as an unit to.make the calculations of the investment. 


TL;DR: Bitcoin isn't currency because it's not even money. It can't be money until it's value becomes stable enough that it won't fluctuate more than a normal inflation rate.

So you're actually doing it like me. I don't know, maybe that's just a flat concept I had in my brain. I seem to have been thinking that ""day traders"" would automatically mostly trade Bitcoin, because of its volume and also popularity really. 


Which is I why I wanted a curve, where you outperformed holding Bitcoin by *trading Bitcoin*. As in, it is the trades that make you better, not the assets, which is what it is, when you include Altcoins. 


I trade all kinds of coins, I frankly think are absolute garbage. But I trade them anyway, because they pump better than others. You seem to be doing that, I'm doing that aswell. I trade weekly mostly and try to predict market sentiment on a weekly swing. It's profitable and gains me Bitcoin over time, but really I'm switching Alts and Tether mostly.

Do you think with your trading capabilities, you could trade Bitcoin on daily basis and outperform just holding it? Just a gut feeling maybe, you think you could do it? 


Because me and my friends have been considering to day trade some small sum and see how it goes, but I really think it's easy to blind yourself to short-term success.

Every MB increase quietly pushes out vast numbers of more people, unless kept strictly beneath Nielsen's law (which hasn't been the case so far).

And 9 years to 1 GB would still be too slow anyway, since you need multiple gigs to reach Visa level capacity. In an ideal world this will become bigger than Visa, Mastercard, and Discover combined. (I personally want to see it even go farther than that, and have the internet of things using bitcoin to trade resources autonomously, like solar energy generation and storage.)

I don't follow how block size is more resource conservative than segwit, since segwit is just a space efficiency improvement. I'm not familiar with mesh nets posing an unsolved problem. Maybe there's a problem I don't know about. I do know that Craig Wright has been trying to convince people lately that finding a path of sufficient liquidity is NP hard or something, but it's absolutely not. It's just the [widest path problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widest_path_problem) which is of course well known and easily solved. I think the internet itself tends to be centralized simply because of capitalistic, political reasons. Cryptos will help change that. (I wanna see a smart contract ISP)

One of the nice things about the lightning network is that it will incentivise people to run non-mining full nodes. If anyone can run a node with a stake in the chain's correctness, that makes the network decentralized. Hashpower alone doesn't control the chain. So you're right, people who mine all have ASICs, but soon lots of people who don't have deep pockets or thicc fiber will be wanting to run nodes, and that's a great thing for the network.",1524599001

I do support what Bitcoin Cash is doing, but I don't see things changing for the better unless BTC's price is taken down. BTC/BCH ratio isn't something to be taken lightly, in fact I think that's the most important metric when comparing the two Bitcoins\*.

Miners will mine the coin with bigger profits in block reward and fees, because that's in their best interest, nothing can change that. Better to have $100 in fees per block than $5 in fees per block, right?

If the fee market is for sending money like btc was in a few months ago yes I agree with your statement. But what I mean is that if fees rise even a bit it will kill almost all micropayments apps using BCH, which should keep the fees pretty low for payments.

I have no proof of this but my study of economics and money theory makes me convinced that cash/payments is the most useful economic service/good on the market, if we consider the network effect to be huge (I imagine that by then a big percentage of the world population would be using BCH as money)

But let me share with you my analysis: Cryptokitties clogged ETH (and I experienced it firsthand) because: ETH is not used as money, the network effect is small, ETH had not a lot of room of capacity and cryptokitties provided more value than anything else on that chain. I do not believe this can happen on BCH because all of these elements are different, and BCH #1 value proposition is to be cash for the world.",1524598318
"Well for USD it is bad to keep a set amount of dollars in a savings account because the value of those dollars would decrease in value over time due to inflation.   So it is important to find a way to use the dollars in savings in order to not lose value.  We end up loaning our money to the banks so they can use it and compensate us for that usage. 

The same concept isn't popular in bitcoin yet, but it is entirely realistic in the future, and from other cryptocurrencies.",1524598317

"&gt; We aren't stuck with the current state of bitcoin forever.

No. Changes can be made to the core code, and any miners that adopt the change will be supporting the new code. S2X was intended to be such a change but was rejected by the btc community, so the fork never happened. Had it happened, we'd have a different bitcoin today than we did 2 years ago. There's nothing saying it wont be attempted to be changed several times in the future, and any of those potential changes could be mass adopted and we get a different bitcoin on the other side. 

It's all a matter of why is there an attempt at change, and will the new code result in a better bitcoin. If we see obvious shortcomings as more people adopt and we scale up, there might be legitimate need to make changes to the core code for it to develop any further.

If some other crypto figures out ways to do things better than bitcoin, there's really no reason why bitcoin itself couldn't just adopt whatever those differences were, depending on what the specific changes would be.",1524598189

"Cryptocurrencies competing against each other would be perfectly fine. But unfortunately this is way worse, and OP's screenshot is a perfect example of it, it's about a group of people misleading the public for own profit.

As you can see in the outlined area of the screenshot, the site lists 2 currencies, Bitcoin (BCH) and Bitcoin Core (BTC). As a matter of a fact, there is no such coin as ""Bitcoin Core"".

BTC or ""Bitcoin"" as we all know since 2009, is a protocol or an economic unit where ""Bitcoin Core"" is one out of many wallet implementations.

BCH is known as ""Bitcoin Cash"" or ""Bcash"". Though the site on the screenshot is listing it as just ""Bitcoin"" in an attempt to forcefully take the brand and mislead people into thinking it's the coin that's being spoken of on the news or in friend-to-friend conversations.

Lots of news media have spoken about Bitcoin being over $10000 a while ago, but BCH has never achieved such a thing at the time of writing this, however if this kind of lies keep spreading people will begin thinking so.

Far from the page being shown in the screenshot, associated people and companies have been spreading tons of misleading info all over the media like for example [this](https://twitter.com/rogerkver/status/853250894162350080) which is provably false by anyone with enough understanding of the protocol.

This is why, though some people comming from /r/all may not understand the situation, anyone who is aware of this will get upset whenever they read Bcash is spreading bullshit again like attempting to call it just ""Bitcoin"" or ""The real Bitcoin"".

"I understand your concern.

However BCH is about moving forward. It is very much like entrepreneurship, and it is about taking risks to pave the future by pushing the limits.

We have no idea where those limits are today, they may not even exist. Yes we can imagine ""what if we reach a limit"" but as I have learned, this is not really constructive thinking as long as the limit is not even in sight.

In the worst case, the limit is reached, miners refuse to upgrade to bigger blocks for some reasons, and fees will rise a bit, killing all micropayments applications. Cash will remain the main feature (because people will be more willing to pay fees to send money than anything else) and we will see a similar situation that btc is in right now (but for real practical reasons this time). In that case layer 2 solutions and other solutions to scaling will become more interesting and micropayments businesses will have to adapt their business model (for example yours.org, contrary to memo.cash, does not store the data of posts on the blockchain but on their own server, this is the kind of things we could expect business to do in that case)",1524597854

"&gt; Bitcoin has way more inflation and deflation than fiat

Bitcoin doesn't have any deflation, and the inflation is set in stone without a hard fork change.

The coin itself is pretty much the most stable currency concept in the world, it's the value of everything else relative to bitcoin that's so unstable it makes using bitcoin as a currency today unreliable. Fiat is far more versatile in that specific regard, as fiat policies can be changed with changing political or economic climates.

"Credibility is important to science. It's why we trust some journals, but not others. It's why you must list funding sources. It's why your career is instantly destroyed the moment you get caught presenting fake data. Science tries to be as objective as possible, but the core message in modern philosophy of science discussions is that it is impossible to divorce science from the failings of the human mind. The way to separate the good from the bad is to demand evidence generated under compelling methods. Evidence I have asked for from you. Instead all I see is ideology steeped in moral superiority. An ideology I happen to agree with; a fact that I don't think you've noticed. I am not on this sub to troll. I'm here because I'm an actual adopter of bitcoin - and not just as a get-rich-quick investment. So I am not debating the ideology behind it. I am debating whether it has been successfully applied and stress-tested in an rather unrelated realm. A discussion forum is *very* different beast than a financial ledger.

I practice experimental science as a career. Ideologies and hypotheses and guesses masquerading as ""theories"" are a dime-a-dozen. People are good at generating ideas that seem plausible. These can be comfortable or convenient to believe. But they are not so different from faith until tested. When you are attempting to promote an ideological shift, the burden is on you to convince people.

Your inclination to declare my skepticism as unscientific is absurd. Skepticism is the foundation on which science rests. Were it not for that, charlatans and snake-oil salesmen would take over. I cannot accept the blind application of any ideology, no matter how seemingly great, without careful consideration. Just because a distributed consensus system works well for a financial ledger doesn't mean we can claim it is possible to apply the technology to every facet of life. We can certainly try, though (and should). But I am unconvinced a decentralized community can prevent decay by popularity. This is not the same as being convinced of the opposite.

I must be really stupid because I ctrl+f and search 'easy' in the original whitepaper and I get zero hits. Can you show me where it says that? (https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)

&gt; almost instant

So, I searched again for 'fast' and 'instant' and I got zero hits for instant and 3 for fast, but all three for 'fast' were referring to the speed of the chain growing to prevent attacks from someone trying to coopt the blockchain whatever *that* means. Can you explain why? I mean, you must be right so please tell me where I can find this in the whitepaper like you say.

&gt; always cheap enough so that people in the third world can use it

&gt; BTC isn't any of those things anymore.

Uhhhh fast, cheap, easy to use... it is actually all of those things. For me it always has been. And since I'm so dumb it must be for everyone, right? Are you think of some other coin or something? Or ... do you just repeat what someone else told you...?

&gt; Even the developers don't consider it money, but a ""store of value"".

Wow, weird, I never had the realization that money isn't a store of value. I mean, I thought that's exactly what money was. A way to standardize value so that you can store a sheep's value in a coin or bill so you don't have to bring a sheep to the hardware store to exchange for scissors or a hammer.

&gt; bug-ridden LN for any kind of scaling

uhh...? BTC relies on LN for scaling? Huh, news to me, I never noticed that. I always thought of segwit and LN as upgrades and that on chain scaling can indeed still happen. I mean I'm no genius or anything but to me it makes sense to compress cotton balls before putting them in the bottle instead of just getting enormous bottles to gently floof cotton balls into more and more.

&gt; And at the same time, that removes power from the miners, and destroys the equilibrium sustained on greed incentives, which is the economic part that makes Bitcoin a genious idea that works in the real world.

&gt; BTC is definitely not the original. The current iteration of BTC has been through many revisions and even hardforks where it was the one changing in the fork.

The original is, however, created through network consensus. The network consensus is that Bitcoin should still exist, while Bitcoin Cash should exist as a separate entity, and that's fine.

If Bitcoin is worse, then Bitcoin Cash will be the name in the media anyway. There's no need to make this half-assed attempt to confuse people that it's the ""real"" Bitcoin.

"&gt;“soft forks”

&gt;sneakily change the very foundations of the original BTC protocol



Satoshi implemented the 1MB limit as a soft fork. 


&gt; Blockstream’s true genius.

Most of the changes in BTC, all the way up to, and including SegWit, were done via soft forks, even before Blockstream was a thing.

&gt;With that said, technologically speaking, many do have a valid reason to feel as if BCH is the ‘real’ Bitcoin, ‘real’ meaning BCH is more in-line with the original low-fee, fast transaction Bitcoin protocol that got everybody into crypto in the first place.

When blocks are not full, Bitcoin works just as in the past, nothing changed. In fact, in terms of fees expressed in sat/b, very recently the fees were the lowest since 2011! have a look at [this chart](https://transactionfee.info/charts/feerate/median?avg=7&amp;step=false&amp;start=2011-02-04&amp;end=2018-04-23), plots the median fee over time. So what happened? Well, price went up! Keep in mind that the same will happen to BCH, if it appreciates significantly. The average fee is ~8sat/b now, and was ~25sat/b earlier this year. And blocks were not full, so you can't say that fees will get lower because blocks will get bigger.

&gt;Especially with BCH re-implementing OP codes that were disabled for reasons that still remain unknown, that allows the BCH Bitcoin protocol to be a platform for other projects to build on top off of, similar to Ethereum.


OP_RETURN was disabled by Satoshi, as well as a bunch of other OP codes, to address vulnerabilities. The question is rather why were they not re-instated, but that's well known - Precisely to **avoid** something like Ethereum being built on top! I want Bitcoin to be used for money, not as the base for all possible DApps in the world, like CryptoKitties and other such junk. Look at what happened to ETH, DAO clusterfudge + fork and the parity hack, which will be forked soon, most likely. How is that an ""immutable"" ledger??? If you can change money like that, it's not sound money. And giving Turing completeness is guaranteed to generate bugs, because humans are not machines... and sometimes we code when we're tired.

&amp;nbsp;

All in all... since it was Satoshi that introduced many of the features in place today, including the 1MB limit AND disabling OP codes, I'm not sure BCH is particularly reflective of ""Satoshi's vision"".

Right, but in that case some _alts_ have hard forked off. Bitcoin didn't do anything, and it certainly can't be considered an ""upgrade"" to Bitcoin!

Yes you can; we risked it last year during the UASF.

See: https://bitcoin.org/en/version-history for version history and whether they are syncable or not. Also this chain does a great job of explaining why the 2013 hardfork did not result in a chain split.

"this is not accurate - it calls it ""Bitcoin Cash / BCash"" - mentioning the two labels, including the derogatory one, is very different from picking the derogatory one and only using that .... one may not like it, but I'd say there's an argument to be made given the reality that it's often referred to by the latter to include both for clarity, regardless of one's 'political stance' on the matter ....

at least in my view, if Trezor had just called it ""BCash"" I'd see that as a negative factor in choosing between them and Nano Ledger ... but the fact that they're referring to both terms, I don't really see that as a big negative.

You know enough about crypto to be fully aware that BCH is not the scam it is painted as, and while Roger can be inflammatory and gung ho, I think you would agree that this comes from a place of passion rather than malicious intent.

This discussion wouldn't silence the trolls on either side (it would likely enflame them), and it certainly wouldn't bury the scaling-war hatchet, but it just might encourage people on the outside to look into this wonderful world we're all working towards, and wasn't that the reason you got into this in the first place?

a. MyCompany stock goes up 1%
b. sales go up 30% 

The two are tracked separately. We know MyCompany has a demand for stock and is being traded. Day traders may also be creating demand driving the stock up.

A few weeks from now the stock may go up 10% more because of the successful sales... however if sales were not tracked only ""day trading value"" it may remain at 1% .

Right now most cryptos are primarily affected by: either ""investments, holding decreases supply increases price"" or ""day trading ups/downs"" or entry barriers to market (BTC/ETH/LTC must be purchased to buy alt)...

however navcoin can do what BTC does but is not a broker on coinbase. If navcoin starts being traded and ""invested in"" the price goes up. However if navcoin ends up being used daily how would we track its ""adoption"" and consider it worth investing further when we only look at ""Day trading"" benchmarks?

Since both implement the Bitcoin protocol for transferring information and storing the transactions both have the right to be called Bitcoin, BTC supporters claim that since they own the original github they should be the only ones with right to the Bitcoin name, and BCH supporters claim that since they adhere more strictly to what is described in the whitepaper they should be the ones called Bitcoin.

Since then, a new Difficulty Adjustment Algortihm (DAA) has been deployed on BCH that adjusts every block and does a very good job of ensuring 144 blocks per day on average (equal to six block per hour on average). The interesting thing is, this now means that BCH finds blocks at much more accurate intervals than BTC does, since BTC only adjusts difficulty every 2016 blocks, and hash rate almost always grows during those intervals. So eventually, BTC will again have more coins in circulation than BCH unless they change their DAA, hash rate trends change, or the ""Cashening"" occurs first.",1524594522

"No worries...

I still think the electricity cost is the biggest influence, and before you can figure out a solution for that centralizing force, I don't think the block-size difference will matter that much. Anybody mining BTC/BCH is using ASICs anyway--my bet is that if you can afford an ASIC miner, you probably have your storage and networks costs covered. 

Your logic re GB blocks is sound and I hadn't considered this before, but it is no longer correct to use 1MB as our initial block-size.  BCH has 32MB blocks coming May15 and I *assume* there will be no bandwidth issues--time will tell. So if we consider 32MB the starting point, that's less than 9 years from GB blocks, and that doesn't sound too far off the mark. And keep in mind BCH is not against 2nd layer solutions, they are against being forced onto layer 2 before it is necessary. I've heard it repeated many times that IF Lightning works as advertised, BCH would consider adopting it. 

A straight block size increase is more conservative resource-wise VS SegWit--that much is just fact. If Lightning Network can get its ish together, then you may have a point. But for someone who appears to have a CS background, and who is concerned about centralization, you have to realize that the only network topology that would currently work for LN is hub-and-spoke, right? Decentralized routing of the kind LN would require to establish a mesh-type network is an unsolved problem in CS. It doesn't scale past 100,000 nodes or so. If it existed, the internet itself would use it. However, this is a much more difficult problem than internet routing because you would need to keep track of ever-changing BTC balances in each of the vertices.

I had before my eyes, thus, a chart that could also be read and interpreted like a musical score. I immediately wondered what that score would be like. This melody that we in the ever growing Bitcoin community compose every day, how would it sound?

I decided, then, to embark on the challenging task of translating that BTC/USD chart to discover that hidden melody, from the initial exchange rate in 2010 to the 31st December, 2017. Naturally I came across many obstacles. Confronted with the strictly mathematical aspect, because of the great fluctuations in the value of Bitcoin –especially during 2017–, I was forced to modify several tonal intervals, as there is no instrument that can comprehend a scale from 1 to 20000.

What you will listen to, then, is a close approach to this “score”, focused rather on its artistic aspect than on the mathematical one. As I worked on the musical translation, images kept coming to my head, so I decided to also make a video to go with the melody I was uncovering.

I leave you here then this game, this experiment truly hoping that you enjoy it. A way to acknowledge my work, if you liked it, is to share the video among your friends.

And I also leave here my address (1F6ovYqfXFR1HJPCv1ovFFeFHuc5aojys9) and QR code for those who liked it so much that they would like to collaborate with a donation ;)

A warm hug to all the global BTC community! Gerswissman.

"Of course you can, where did I say you can't? 

But what I explicitly said was ""*don't do absolutely anything with your wallet/node*"". And if you do keep your software non-updated, you will spend the coins on the Bitcoin chain, not the Bitcoin Cash one. To spend your BCH you'll need to get new software, claim your new coins, and then start spending them. So it's a really hard sell to say that ""the true Bitcoin"" is represented by this coin which I have spend all this effort to spend, whilst the coin which requires no effort whatsoever is ""not Bitcoin"".

I pick snaller Mc coins with daily volume in the 500k range as I’m intimately familiar with the amount of money needed to move the price and the sell walls are often trivial in comparison to the larger platform coins in the top ten. When I first started I primarily held while I learned about TA and such. Since I’ve been primarily trading as of late 2016. My methods likely would not work for many as I rely on my own instincts for market movement. As for a preferred time frame I can’t say I have one as I shoot for consistency. I don’t trade with bitcoin and rely on alts so the comparison isn’t the same. I look for daily high/lows that foster 10-15%.

"Again, this is by definition not true. From the quoted article:

&gt;In the years following the Genesis Block, there have been several hard forks. During a hard fork, software implementing bitcoin and its mining procedures is upgraded; once a user upgrades his or her software, that version rejects all transactions from older software, effectively creating a new branch of the blockchain.

A at least two branches are created at every hardfork and were created during prior hard forks as well. If a branch is not mined or widely supported, it dies out.

This is also why any version of Bitcoin Core implementation prior to 0.7.2 fails to sync. That is when the 2013 hard fork took place See: https://bitcoin.org/en/version-history for version history and whether they are syncable or not. Also this chain does a great job of explaining why the 2013 hardfork did not result in a chain split.

Everyone could run that application locally, and since the IPFS-Hash is on the blockchain, everyone can download that exact app. that application could interpret the incoming transactions to its address and work with that as input .. this is of course limited to some extend, for example the ""bid+refund"" system of ENS can not work.

Oven if they managed to cut the transaction size times TEN, it would still be around $0.60 per transaction.

"That distinction isn't sufficient anymore. It used to be back when there was just one bitcoin blockchain and Bitcoin was the currency on it, but shit got more complicated. Now we have ""bitcoin"" and we have both BTC and BCH. The name ""Bitcoin"" used to refer to BTC and it arguably still does, but if you want to refer to BTC instead of ""bitcoin"" the idea, you're better off just using BTC instead to prevent any ambiguity as there's no authority on ""Bitcoin"" and no consensus anymore either",1524592747
"They aren't ignoring or censoring. They just don't come to r/btc or follow BCH ers because they are convinced BTC is the only bitcoin. They are in an echo chamber. They can only report what they know there are only a few truly neutrals in the cryptocurrency media the rest are either bch/btc orientated. Even the BCH media is skewed in favor of BCH. That means that we have to tell about how they got it wrong. You have to explain why their facts are wrong and back it up with your own facts. Here is a perfect example...this YouTubers prides himself on fundamentals and he is spot on, on most of his cryptocurrency reviews, but he is SO BTC centric that he has never taken the time to truly research the BCH fundamentals. In fact, he was so far off on this video. I corrected him with facts in the comments and then he thanked me for the info. https://youtu.be/N3-J4PDkkZY

"Forgot about this conversation.
You can't just say other decentralization problems have no legs because electricity cost is more prominent. If that's the case, why don't we just turn both coins into paypal? If all other centralization concerns are just ""mild background noise,"" why not? Electricity is an equal problem for both coins, so it's irrelevant to a discussion of which coin is better.

We can't wait for multi-gig blocks to be as trivial as 1MB blocks are today. Moore's law for internet bandwidth is called Nielsen's law, and it says bandwidth grows by about 50% per year. That's over 17 years just to get from 1MB to 1GB...and that's still nowhere near sufficient block size for Visa-level functionality.

BCH is more conservative in the design sense that you're saying. I meant conservative in terms of resource usage.

I would love it if big blocks were all we needed to get bitcoin where it needs to be. The fact is, the math just doesn't work. We have to do more. The BCH side of the debate was seeded with the rational idea of ""maybe we should increase block sizes for now to keep the ball rolling until we figure out the long-term plan."" It has since evolved into a cult-like following of Roger Ver that's obsessed with the destruction of 'core', who claim that all who oppose them are corporate trolls. 

As a side note: Weirdly, the BCH community does tend to acknowledge Ver's and Craig Wright's deceits when they happen, but they quickly forget and go back to idolizing them. That's not super on-topic to this discussion about basic facts and merits of the coins themselves, but it is a red flag.",1524592695

BCH is fullfilling the role of the electronic p2p cash system described in the whitepaper. Which should be very easy to use for everyone in the world, almost instant, always cheap enough so that people in the third world, and always scale on chain.

BTC isn't any of those things anymore. Even the developers don't consider it money, but a ""store of value"". It has broken 0-conf and instant payments on chain thanks to RBF and it now depends on the embarrasingly complex and bug-ridden LN for any kind of scaling (that it can actually scale is yet to be seen). And at the same time, that removes power from the miners, and destroy the equilibrium sustained  on greed incentives, which is the economic part that makes Bitcoin a genious idea that works in the real world.",1524592454

As soon as you learn a little about the background, you find out about the difference between BCH or BTC or BitcoinDarkDiamond 4.0, and it's up to you to decide which coin you prefer.  

Again, cryptos are not for the stupid and careless, and we should not care about them. If you want to have a truly decentralized, free, censorship resistant, p2p currency, you must force people to learn about it before using it.",1524592442

"Gonna get downvoted but if anyone is willing to have a cordial debate, feel free to respond.

I think the partnership that verge made with PH does NOT set a bad precedent simply because companies will find economic incentive in many other ways than ""pay to play exclusive crypto partnerships."" Look at Nokia and how they sent a precedent within the technological community, their stock tripled just from the announcement that they are gonna fiddle with the blockchain... As crypto is more widely adopted, merchants will not only feel inclined to accept it, but will more or less be forced to in some regards. Look at visa/mastercard, if your shop now\-a\-days doesn't accept those cards, rip half your sales. Look in the long term. Do you think visa will pay ever to be accepted on any sites? Obviously not. 

Right now crypto is an infancy that companies generally don't have a great deal of incentive to adopt crypto, so giving a push\-off start like this is beneficial for the crypto community as a whole. Additionally, PH didn't pocket the money. It takes time and money to integrate into payment portals, and advertise to get the word out that PH was going to accept this crypto. Nothing comes free in this world, and judging by how much PH did for Verge \(whole day PH changed their logo to verge themed and huge banner\- reaching hundreds of millions of people.. billions of impressions\), that alone is worth more than what Verge put in.

Partnership is also by MindGeek, not just PH. Brazzers and Nakutu is already also accepting Verge. Trafficjunky is also being speculated to begin accepting XVG payments \(also.... a daughter company of MindGeek\). Hell, Probiller could simply integrate XVG through their payment processing company DIRECTLY which would mean that every porn company \(since every porn company uses TrafficJunky and Probiller\) would be forced into having XVG as a payment option. 

This is a really good kickstart for adoption, but I do agree that there is more need for more ease of access into crypto. It's quite hard for people to acquire verge unless they go through 2 exchanges and wait multiple days. But you'd be foolish to say that this decision was hasty and greed filled, because when a company that is worth literal billions wants to make a partnership happen, and every company in said $100 billion dollar industry has to go through them in some way, $3,000,000 is chump change and Verge was smart to hop on the opportunity. Oh yeah also legitimizing the use case of a privacy coin in such a way not only gives Verge such a leg up in the whole industry, but also shows that Privacy coins has legitimate real world use.

"Some time ago I started to think about the intrinsic connection between music and math. 
As I looked at the graphs of the BTC/USD exchange rate, during my routine technical analysis, I imagined that each of those numbers –for example, in a monthly, weekly or daily candlestick chart– could represent or correspond to a note in the tonal musical scale.  
  
I had before my eyes, thus, a chart that could also be read and interpreted like a musical score. 
I immediately wondered what that score would be like. This melody that we in the ever growing Bitcoin community compose every day, how would it sound?

I decided, then, to embark on the challenging task of translating that BTC/USD chart to discover that hidden melody, from the initial exchange rate in 2010 to the 31st December, 2017.
Naturally I came across many obstacles.
Confronted with the strictly mathematical aspect, because of the great fluctuations in the value of Bitcoin –especially during 2017–, I was forced to modify several tonal intervals, as there is no instrument that can comprehend a scale from 1 to 20000.

What you will listen to, then, is a close approach to this “score”, focused rather on its artistic aspect than on the mathematical one.
As I worked on the musical translation, images kept coming to my head, so I decided to also make a video to go with the melody I was uncovering.

I leave you here then this game, this experiment truly hoping that you enjoy it.
A way to acknowledge my work, if you liked it, is to share the video among your friends.

And I also leave here my address (44321ecd-d973-4187-900f-466eae57b8fb) and QR code for those who liked it so much that they would like to collaborate with a donation ;)

No they're not because YOUR COIN ARTIFICIALLY CAPPED THE COST TO ATTACK IT when they removed ASIC mining.

"Lol, this silly point. How about the technology and the code behind the two?

BCH’s code is almost identical to BTC prior to Blockstream/segwit - the same code that got BTC to where it is today. 

BTC code resembles that of original SN BTC more so than current Bitcoin Core. You may feel that it’s no different because of being able to spend your 2016 coins on the current BTC chain, however if you take a closer look into the “soft forks” that allow you to do so, you would see that the implemented soft-forks, sneakily change the very foundations of the original BTC protocol, which I believe to be Blockstream’s true genius.

With that said, technologically speaking, many do have a valid reason to feel as if BCH is the ‘real’ Bitcoin, ‘real’ meaning BCH is more in-line with the original low-fee, fast transaction Bitcoin protocol that got everybody into crypto in the first place.

Especially with BCH re-implementing OP codes that were disabled for reasons that still remain unknown, that allows the BCH Bitcoin protocol to be a platform for other projects to build on top off of, similar to Ethereum. ",1524591404

Yeah I personally think the “umbrella” approach is the most reasonable. I don’t really have a problem with the statement that “Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin.” I think most who are making that statement are doing so as a provocative way to express one of the following ideas: (1) Bitcoin Cash is the chain that most closely adheres to the original vision; (2) Bitcoin Cash is likely to emerge as the dominant chain; (3) “Bitcoin” is an umbrella term and Bitcoin Cash properly falls within the scope of that term. Obviously if by “Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin” someone means that “a reasonable person hearing the term ‘Bitcoin’ would understand it to refer unambiguously to the BCG chain,” then that’s just silly.

"&gt; &gt;   there is more market interest than can be explained by poor, hopelessly confused n00bs
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I hope you weren't just trying to diminish my argument into a strawman like that.

More a response to a lot of sentiment in the thread that Roger is evil, and the confusion caused by the ""Bitcoin"" in ""Bitcoin Cash"" is the sole reason for it's popularity.  I don't think so.  There was certainly PR reasons behind the choice of name, but if that was all it had, it would have much less market interest now -- Bitcoin Gold is a good example.  You can find some places that still trade it, but it's value is abysmal.  

&gt; However I think there is a flaw with your statement in general. A small number of people can convince a large number of people about conspiracies and technological solutions that others disagree with, and that can create a base that is strong enough to then support an even much larger portion of people to speculate on the price.

That is a reasonable point.  Bear in mind it might well be applied to both sides of this discussion, though.

&gt; My biggest concern with BCH is what if it wins, and then 10 years from now, on-chain scaling is an ENORMOUS problem, and the block-chain is too large to be run outside datacenters, and then governments shut down datacenters to stop bitcoin.

I don't think the BCH camp is completely averse to off-chain scaling.  Just that at the current time, it is not the appropriate solution.  My concern with BTC and LN is actually similar -- I suspect that the network model that will grow is that you will have most users (both buyers and sellers) connected as leaf nodes to large, well connected hubs, much like TCP traffic is with the current internet.  And those hubs will be vulnerable to both overt and covert attacks.  Centralization of one sort or another is inevitable as adoption goes mainstream.

TBH, I do think that BCH is more likely to come out on top in the long run, but it's by no means certain.  It may well be BTC or some other coin that wins out.  Or the whole concept may end up a failed experiment.  Ask me in a decade.  Or two.  :D",1524590764
"My recommendation is to tweet Joe to ask Andreas about Bitcoin Cash.   

Though many of you think AA is 100% pro-Core, that is false.  

He definitely fails to speak out against them.  But he has routinely touted the merits of Bitcoin Cash on the LTB podcast over the last year.  So if he were asked, he would give a fair and balanced response.  He has done so many times.  

And quite honestly, any “raising of the topic” will be insane exposure for BCH.  Especially since Andreas absolutely won’t call it a scam or talk trash.  

He describes it as a viable approach to scaling and that he supports the market deciding.  Let’s make sure it gets brought up.  ",1524590752

Anyhow, BTC is currently the main alt gateway, miners are going to mine due to economic incentive, regardless of politics, that’s how the system works. Given the BCH code, any  BTC alt-pairing can also be a BCH-alt pair. Also, given BCH algorithm is derived from BTC, if/when more BCH-alt markets arise, miners can easily use their existing hardware to mine BCH.

Bottom line, if BCH continues it’s adoption trend, you will see a shift in hash-rate.",1524590482
"My intuition tells me something here is off.   Here's some math:

Let's estimate Bitcoin's current power consumption:

26000000TH/14TH = 1857143 S9's

1857143 * 1.4kW = 2600000kW

2600000kW == 2600MW

2600MW * 8760 hours/year = 22,776,000MWh/year.  Probably considerably lowballed, since it assumes every miner is an S9 and neglects most inefficiencies, not to mention altcoins.

According to the US government, US-based airlines consumed about 17.7 billion gallons of jet fuel in 2016.  The energy density of jet fuel is about 37kWh/gallon.

17.7E9 * 37 / 1000 (to get MWh) = 654,900,000MWh/year

If my math is right (and I might have goofed somewhere), US airlines burn about 30 times more energy than the Bitcoin network uses in electrical energy.

But if we suddenly ran out of fuel for cars and airplanes, the global economy would essentially collapse overnight.",1524590478

Good reply. I fully agree that naming in itself is decentralized and in that sense my rant here and in related threads is no different than our common, tireless attempts to rant at small blockers. It's just sharing my view on the matter.

I'd like to stay out of the naming discussions but I got into it because I strongly disagree with the notion stated by others and summarized by you as ""others"": that there can be some underlying rules or essential character that forms a requirement for Bitcoin being Bitcoin.

Such rules introduce an authority, whether it's an authority of the whitepaper or of the code or of some assumption of intent.

This harms decentralisation, not quantitatively but qualitatively.

I do agree that Bitcoin is well used as an umbrella term, and an attempt to upgrade like Bitcoin Cash (or SegWit) is certainly no ""altcoin"" in its traditional meaning. This does not in itself supports a statement that ""Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin.""",1524590028

"Segwit was stalled for a year, mainly by Bitmain, which is the issuer of bcash. Bitmain has enough control in China that many other miners assumed that everthing that company puts out in the media is true.

The problem with Segwit is that it bricks covert asicboost, i.e. it decreases the efficiency of Bitmains miners. So, they issued this coin that still works with covert asicboost.

Just issuing a coin is not enough, it drops to zero. What they did was use every success bitcoin had and project it onto themselves. And at the same time trash bitcoin whenever they can.

They can do that because they have such huge amounts of money. Bitmain must have a substantial percentage of all bitcoin, their revenue last year was about $4 billion. And their cheerleader Roger Ver may on his own be worth maybe another $1 billion.

Roger is very aggressive against bitcoin. He controls bitcoin(.)com and @bitcoin. Both these channels spout anti-bitcoin propaganda every minute of the day.

The goal of bcash is to kill off bitcoin. That’s their business model.

The problem with bcash is that it’s a centralized coin that does the same thousands of other coins do. And it’s not even good at it. From an organic growth perspective, bcash can not be in the top 20. It has no merit, they took the bitcoin code, made it less secure, and started marketing the hell out of it. It should drop to $3.50. But then again, it’s growth is not organic. One of the things you see is that they start burning coins to boost deflation and that Bitmain does not sell the bcash it mines, because the value would then drop below 10% of bitcoin.

It’s a scam, because they claim to be something they’re not. They’re not bitcoin and they don’t care about other people’s babies. They care about money and probably the kick of the scamming process itself.

"Several issues. First when you put all hackers into one group as if there aren't Russian hackers that work for organized crime, the government, various companies, and independently. 

Then you implied that organized criminals who you seem to think all the hackers in Russia belong to are only in it to steal money. First there is no evidence that organized crime is the one doing this hack to steal crypto. This could easily be a single person who found an exploit. Second, you implied that hackers were only after stealing money. I supplied several points against that most notably is the stealing of celebrity nude photos but there are many other examples of hackers who don't care about monetary gain that made the news. Plus, several examples of ways to make money hacking without stealing money.

And now, in this comment, you talk about DNC claims that Russians hacked the election. That's a misleading what of phrasing it at best and outright not understanding the claim at worst because that makes it sound like they claim that Russians hacked the actual election system and created fake votes. When the claim is actually, that Russians hacked into systems to get information that they could publicly release to have an impact on the election and that Russian troll farms were spreading misinformation in an attempt to influence the election. Even if someone at the DNC thought the election results were hacked and tampered with directly which I haven't heard, that would only be a small part of the overall claim.

The guy above you's argument is that BCH follows Bitcoin's original scaling roadmap more closely than Bitcoin's current roadmap.

Also, forks=/=bad. There have been quite a few hardforks on the Bitcoin network over the years, with the community collectively deciding that the legacy chain is inferior. This could be something as simple as a mining bug, and the network forks to fix it. Who would stay on the old chain? No one. Theres no reason to follow a flat out inferior chain.

The Bitcoin whitepaper defines ""Bitcoin"" as the longest PoW chain. So that is how a fork can become the original. If Bitcoin Cash maintained &gt;51% hashrate since the fork, it would be called Bitcoin. It hasn't but that doesnt mean it won't",1524589469

Roger gets so much hate while Blockstream gets none whatsoever, even though they censor, suppress dissent, and dictate how the community should behave i.e. in a way that keeps them in control of bitcoin so they can profit off their product which relies on small blocks.

"Segwit was stalled for a year, mainly by Bitmain, which is the issuer of bcash. Bitmain has enough control in China that many other miners assumed that everthing that company puts out in the media is true.

The problem with Segwit is that it bricks covert asicboost, i.e. it decreases the efficiency of Bitmains miners. So, they issued this coin that still works with covert asicboost.

Just issuing a coin is not enough, it drops to zero. What they did was use every success bitcoin had and project it onto themselves. And at the same time trash bitcoin whenever they can.

They can do that because they have such huge amounts of money. Bitmain must have a substantial percentage of all bitcoin, their revenue last year was about $4 billion. And their cheerleader Roger Ver may on his own be worth maybe another $1 billion.

Roger is very aggressive against bitcoin. He controls bitcoin(.)com and @bitcoin. Both these channels spout anti-bitcoin propaganda every minute of the day.

The goal of bcash is to kill off bitcoin.

The problem with bcash is that it’s a centralized coin that does the same thousands of other coins do. And it’s not even good at it. From an organic growth perspective, bcash can not be in the top 20. It has no merit, they took the bitcoin code, made it less secure, and started marketing the hell out of it. But then again, it’s growth is not organic. One of the things you see is that they start burning coins to boost deflation and that Bitmain does not sell the bcash it mines, because the value would then drop below 10% of bitcoin.

The initial complaint tries to compare the difference between the market price and the lbtc buy/sell price as a ""fee"".   It's not a fee.  Its a discount or markup.  People who value privacy (including those who want to buy or sell contraband) and are unwilling to do the work to compete in the LBTC market pay the higher amount.

What's more, the claim that this person is an exchange or a broker is just crazy.

What is concerning is that because the guy acts guilty.  Its understandable why.  It's because law enforcement is applying the law in such a way as to be confusing to traders, and entrapping them.

**I would suggest that all traders on LBTC state explicitly in their ads that anyone they trade with must agree that they are not using funds for illegal activities.  A further step to avoid entrapment is to snap a photo of anyone stating they are using crypto or fiat for illegal purposes and to share that photo with others in the crypto community.**  Let's face it.  The only criminals who tell others of the illegal activities are stupid or they're actually law enforcement.  If they are law enforcement, they don't want their covers blown.

My biggest concern with BCH is what if it wins, and then 10 years from now, on-chain scaling is an ENORMOUS problem, and the block-chain is too large to be run outside datacenters, and then governments shut down datacenters to stop bitcoin.",1524588980
I think everyone would be fine with Bitcoin (BCH) and Bitcoin (BTC) but that's not what is happening.  It is intentionally trying to confuse people.  You cant deny that. One side is being disingenuous ,1524588974
"What the hell man, it there a counter-discussion on twitter or something? Its like crypto equivalent of a coup",1524588971
"&gt; Especially when he simply states BCH is the true bitcoin as it follows the white paper which says to increase the block size as needed.

BCH fanboys use this line as if the whitepaper is some sort of holy book. Satoshi (be it an individual or a group) was not infallible. The mysticism and godlike status you attribute him are detrimental to the whole ecosystem, and merely an excuse to legitimize Ver's plans. I'm pretty sure if the real Satoshi were to come out in favor of second layer solutions, you'd change your tune. 

&gt; The community saw what happens when the block size doesn’t increase, it can take hours or days for transactions to confirm, with fees over $50. BCH has surpassed BTC in transactions numerous times and never faced such a backlog and skyrocketing of fees. At most around $0.02.

The only time I advocated for an increase in blocksize was as a doomsday solution to what I thought could destroy years of progress for the ecosystem. I was, fortunately, proven wrong. One of the biggest strengths of the REAL bitcoin is its immutability. Hard forked coins are not immutable. BCH is not immutable. The fact that Ver &amp; co are still desperately attacking bitcoin over fees when you don't pay more than 5 cents should be a telling sign that they are like rats on a sinking ship. Because once Bitcoin achieves mainstream level scaling (and I can promise you it will despite what you think. Through segwit, lightning, schnorr and other future solutions), bch will be rendered obsolete. Immutability and brand are what keep bitcoin on top. There are already other currencies much more capable as of NOW to handle mainstream adoption.

Ver and his cronies capitalized on the vocalism of a dissenting group (again, for legitimate reasons) to hijack an interesting project, if anything. If they'd have wanted to prove that bigger blocks were the real solution to scaling, they'd have named it something else and let free market economics decide. But they know bch cannot compete on that level. So they stole the name and added cash to it (which is, imo, laughable and a choice gypsies would make if they were to start their own cryptocurrency). Because they have literally no other option at achieving dominance in the fintech of the future. 

&gt; Blockstream (who’s taken over your beloved BTC)

They have not. Again, free market economics and consenting individual accepted, one by one (very important) their solutions through softforks. What if someone were ok with 8 mb blocks but wouldn't go as far as 32, for whatever reason? Would they have to option to continue using the old chain? Soft forks ensured the legitimacy of the upgrades through an increasing individual adoption and also the immutability of the chain. Monero, eth, bch and many other hardforked coins are jokes in that regard. 

&gt; Ver doesn’t control developers, Blockstream does. So how is Ver evil for spreading what he believes, which also happens to be the truth

The truth he's fed your hurt ego. Need I remind you who these people are? Should I spend some time on searching videos of Ver advocating for lightning network a little over a year ago? Saying that bitcoin kills babies for not having bigger blocks (that one was fucking amazing) Or the fact that he was reading a script and telling people Mtgox was liquid? Can't you see that ALL the people supporting bch are frauds and liars? What does that say about the community? Gullible or malicious?",1524588966

"&gt; Honestly, me and pretty much everyone I know who supports XMR doesn't really give a f*ck about Dash.

Right, that's why you guys spent 4 years shilling against them and fuding them on bitcointalk, right? You think you're talking to someone who hasn't watched your community for years. You can fool some of the people all of the time...

&gt;Besides, there is nothing preventing anyone who likes ASICs mining on XMR from joining XMC/XMO/whatever

And yet when they do you FUD them to all hell calling them scams and other names. No class. 

&gt;Basically, you have no evidence of this at all, it's just your opinion. 

Actually the thread I posted had plenty of evidence. And the fact that you continue to dance around the fact that botnet mining is the most profitable form of mining for monero. That's a fact Jack, whether you hope people don't notice it or not.

&gt;You need concrete proof to point that the size of these botnets is enough to allow them higher hashing rates that the cumulative legitimate miners, otherwise it's just a speculative point.

Nope, because its more efficient to run a botnet operation than anything else, its simple math really.

&gt;You do realize that ASIC producers can in secrecy build the extremely powerful miners in very large quantities and then use those same very large quantities of ASIC miners to dominate more than 51% of the hasrate and perform double spends?

What would they gain from this? The economics of Bitcoin already make this a dumb idea. They are ALREADY mining large quantities of bitcoin. Its a COMPETITION to see who can mine the most, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO TRY AND GET THE MOST BITCOIN. THAT'S THE POINT. The nerve of these guys, they are trying to use NLP to manipulate you into hating the very thing that give cryptocurrencies their viability and security.

&gt;I have not said that I support Blockstream, anywhere in my post.

When Segwit and RBF were added and Op_codes removed from Legacy Bitcoin (BTC), it effectively changed the project and the road map from on chain scaling to off chain/side chian scaling. 

Companies like Blockstream thought they could sell a ""side chain"" service, apparently not realizing alt-coins could serve the same service. 

Many of us continued to believe in the original Bitcoin vision of decentralized digital CASH, not some weird store of digital value with high transfer fees. 

So now Bitcoin is gone, but we have a back up, Bitcoin Cash, which is just Bitcoin but before SegWit was added. Same chain, same code, same everything, so BCH is Bitcoin strictly speaking.

"Yes, I am young. But I am an electrical engineer. While I specialize primarily in battery management systems and power saving algorithms for CPU scheduling, I am still familiar with cryptography used in SSL, WPA2 security, salted hashes for web based security, and yes, even SHA256 algorithms used by many PoW based cryptogcurrencies. 

Although age has nothing to do with it. I'm not saying that you don't understand it because you're old, I am saying you don't understand it because you don't understand it. Most people don't, and that's alright. 

Proof of Capacity is likely going to be the choice of future cryptogcurrencies, as they are a zero-cost algorithm. (It does take electricity, but the algorithm doesn't). 

Your phone doesn't even download any blocks to it, it's just watching the chain via different services offered by nodes, and broadcasting signed transactions. Otherwise your wallet would take up 150gb and need to download constantly. Of course, this would be useless, which is why this was changed. 

Great, so you have 6TB. You can still only verify 1/16th of the transactions, OR 1/16th of the speed as you would on BTC. This is only a problem for nodes though.

What happens is nodes have higher operating costs, and so they will cost more in fees as the blocks increase, increasing demand on SHA256 hashing. 

And, nodes and miners now require internet speeds 16 times as fast. This means that places with 1-2mbps (40% of Americans), or on Centreylink (15%) who have a bandwidth cap, they will not be able to run BCH nodes, while they can barely run BTC nodes. Again, reducing true decentralization. (Although this isn't a big issue, centralized miners and nodes still are secure). This reduction in nodes just means the higher load on hashing or CPU is going to cost more in electricity to run hash functions to verify transactions, and then if it's not profitable, stop. Fewer nodes = increase in fees when blocks get full. ",1524588602

Honestly, me and pretty much everyone I know who supports XMR doesn't really give a f*ck about Dash. Check out the r/Monero latest threads or whatever, I doubt you'll find people discussing it often. Besides, there is nothing preventing anyone who likes ASICs mining on XMR from joining XMC/XMO/whatever, anyone can fork off and gain support based on the specifics that their fork offers.

&gt;As I already explained, botnet mining is the most cost-efficient method of mining, which means it stands to reason that it would formulate the majority of the hashrate just like ASICS do for bitcoin.

Basically, you have no evidence of this at all, it's just your opinion. The average PC that was hacked and used for mining most likely contains a shitty CPU+GPU configuration which will barely mine anything, compared to CPU/GPU rigs which miners build specifically to mine crypto or PC users/enthusiasts with more powerful machines who put their machines to mine while they're not working on them. You need concrete proof to point that the size of these botnets is enough to allow them higher hashing rates that the legitimate miners, otherwise it's just a speculative point.

&gt;No they don't, they rely on good faith. They rely on good faith that rich, powerful actors won't attack them and doublespend their coins. POW only prevents this by being prohibitively expensive, if you remove this protection, you remove that protection.

You do realize that ASIC producers can in secrecy build the extremely powerful miners in very large quantities and then use those same very large quantities of ASIC miners to dominate more than 51% of the hasrate and perform double spends? I'm much more worried about this possibility than botnets.

It wasn't enough to refer to Bitcoin as Bitcoin Core but they now also renamed Bitcoin Cash to Bitcoin,1524588096
"Generalizing a lot here, but I am trying to be fairly neutral with my response:

BTC believes in offchain scaling, Lighting Network and smaller block sizes (and more efficient use of that block size), and generally thinks that any pain today (from high fees, slow transaction times, etc) are worth it now (read: early stage adoption) in order to have a leaner, more efficient chain in the future.


BCH largely sees the limiting of blocksizes as an artificial cap in order to make fees higher and allow the core team to push the lightning network. BCH has larger blocks that are used less efficiently (no segwit) which has relieved the pain now (really low fees, faster transaction times during times of congestion, etc and does not have ""replace by fee"" which makes 0-confirmation transactions viable). BCH supporters see storage space as cheap (who cares if the blockchain is 4tb if you can buy an 8tb drive for $150) and feels that networking will continue to evolve to easily handle large blocks in the future, so there isn't a need for almost-mandatory complex offchain solutions in order to use the blockchain.

They are both splits from the same chain in August 2017, and both are different from the original Bitcoin whitepaper, so neither has a claim to the name besides adoption. In general, the most used chain has the name. The most used chain is not Bitcoin Cash by any measure, and trying to argue so makes you look like an idiot. But if at some point in the future BCH overtakes BTC and it doesn't appear to be contested, I don't see why BCH wouldn't be referred to as Bitcoin at that point. (But that would need to happen first)

Basically it boils down to off chain scaling (BTC) versus on chain scaling (BCH).

"Fees are not tied to price of the coin, no matter what coin. The fees on bitcoin didn't go up to crazy amounts in december because the price went way up. Fees are tied to space in the blocks. Fees got crazy because the blocks were full with a huge back log of transactions waiting so people had to put higher and higher fees to get their transactions sent in a reasonable amount of time. Now at a price of $9000 bitcoin fees are like what they were a year ago at a price of $1000. Price and fees are not directly linked only indirectly through the direct linkage of usage to fees.

I'm tired of seeing people claim Bitcoin transactions will cost hundreds of dollars when the price gets higher, it will only cost that much if the usage skyrockets and the blockchain's throughput does not increase to match (though it is increasing with stuff like segwit and LN).

Anyway, yes BCH fees will increase if they ever were to get a lot of usage, and since they are sticking to everything onchain their only option would be to increase blocksize even more and make BCH super centralized to the point where it loses its value proposition. And of course if it became centralized there would be little competition in the mining market so those that control the BCH mining could raise fees as much as they like no matter if blocks are full or not.",1524587552

I was in the bitcoin game early on when it was all ""freedom and decentralization and libertarian festivals and down with the big banks the internet of money is going to help everyone out of poverty! Everyone can be their own bank! Alpaca socks!""

Then I came back to the scene after a few years and the subreddit had changed to 'Bitcoin was never meant to be a peer to peer electronic cash system, [why would you think that](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)? Why would you ever *buy* anything with bitcoin?'

I'm paraphrasing of course, but fees continued to climb. And the community's focus had changed. And even back in 2015 everyone was blindly hyping some apparent vaporware 'lightning network' which, back then, everyone insisted was ""Just around the corner!"" and ""Lightning Network will fix this! It'll fix everything! We promise! I saw a YouTube video on it once!"", when just increasing the damn block size like Satoshi had left as an option seemed like it would immediately result in lowering fees back to economically moot levels like they had been originally.

I'm glad that we're finally starting to see some of the LN, but I'm still apprehensive that the lightning network will actually fix anything. In my career, I'm very used to vendors and sales guys promising the same kind of promises and when we finally get the product, it's a sack of hot garbage. I still hold my BCH that I got from the fork, and continue to buy small amounts regularly alongside my BTC buys. But that's due to inherent economic selfishness and my refusal to blindly support one side over the other, as if cryptocurrency is some kind of competitive sport where only one side wins.

Really it wasn't until I had the realization that a perfect storm of high fees and high volume with a large blocksize might result in, (though doesn't guarantee), a runaway blockchain size problem, in the event that trading volume doesn't go down. If the market becomes crazy bullish and blocks are full and stay full, having large blocks becomes a big problem really fast. And high fee, full block conditions can come out of nowhere. Just see late 2017 for example. I honestly didn't know if that surge was ever going to stop. I was concerned that $20 fees were just 'the new normal' for bitcoin. It was entirely possible.

I still wish BTC would harken back to their roots a little bit and try to solve some layer 1 problems before moving to layer 2 but as aantonop said, if we really need those things, we can always make Bitcoin2 in 10 years or whenever. And transitioning from Bitcoin to Bitcoin2 will be significantly easier than transitioning from Fiat to Bitcoin1. Let's focus on that first.

"&gt; Decentralization is a continuum, not a discrete variable that you either have or don't.

this is false.

Reduce decentralization to a binary regarding 51% attacking: ""your nodes"" and ""not your nodes.""

&gt; Each additional node provides diminishing returns in terms of increased resilience. 

true if you're just considering nodes as some sort of % obviously, but no, practically this is also false.

Count the # of nodes: if there are 2 total, bad actor needs 3 to ""win.""
if there are 200 total, bad actor needs 201 to win (yes i'm aware it is more, just simplifying). yes, ""each node is a smaller % of the node count"" but that's meaningless.

If anything, running a node makes it MORE inconvenient and less feasible for an attack. It is easy for 1,000,000 people to run 1 node, it is not as easy for 1 person to run 1,000,000 nodes.


And so:

**Each node added is 1 more node that the ""bad actor"" needs to over come. There is no diminishing return to that.**



&gt;  A good answer to this would settle the disagreement, but I've seen none so far.

that's because the knowledge of ""how much % of the nodes/hashing power you control"" = money, and nobody is going to reveal that.

The bottomline there is that nobody who is even remotely close to 51% is going to literally kill bitcoin by being publicly at 51%. As soon as they get there, they'd splinter off % to be unknowable. There literally negative value for revealing that control, and positive value for concealing it. Not a hard decision to make.

So you can never know the value of someone plugging in their USB stick or jalapeno miner... or running a full node.

"&gt;There is no attack on mining.

So why are members of the xmr community taking the same hardline stance that BTC core took and continue to promote?

&gt;you automatically accept the ASIC resistance principle as this is one of the foundations upon which the coin is based.

This must be the talking point or something. Please stop trying to distract from the point of the OP: which is that the ACTUAL reason for xmr's stated anti-asic stance is rooting in the same place as the BTC core's stance.

&gt;Same thing with BTC, if you don't like the 1MB cap on the blocks, don't use BTC, use BCH. It's your free choice, find the coin that matches your principles.

Except BTC core shilled BCH hard and still does. They tried to prevent the entire BCH fork. And after it happened, instead of being happy to get what they want, they've been trolling BCH non-stop. Just like the XMR community did with Dash and other privacy coins it considers 'competition'. Tell me, why would a privacy coin want ALL the privacy transactions? Why would they go out of their way to lie and say that DNMs overwhelmingly accept Monero, and then when confronted lie AGAIN and say that nobody is saying that monero is widely used?  The only reason to want ALL the privacy transactions and give a completely false sense of ABSOLUTE privacy is because you have a hidden motive.

&gt;How do you exactly know this?

Because less than 1% of btc transactions are used for illegal activity according to researchers, that includes extortion through malware.

&gt;Why, on the other hand, you propose that majority of XMR's hashrate comes from bad actors also without any proof?

As I already explained, botnet mining is the most cost-efficient method of mining, which means it stands to reason that it would formulate the majority of the hashrate just like ASICS do for bitcoin.

&gt;Coins which defend ASIC resistance still rely on PoW, lol.

No they don't, they rely on good faith. They rely on good faith that rich, powerful actors won't attack them and doublespend their coins. POW only prevents this by being prohibitively expensive, if you remove this protection, you remove that protection.

&gt;Why don't you go around attacking every other Cryptonight coin which has announced that they'll implement ASIC resistance following XMR. 

Are there any other cryptonight coins that are popular? XMR is barely popular and its the largest one...I don't think there are any other popular cryptonight coins.

&gt;I support BCH, but implying that Blockstream is the reason anything you don't like happens is very childish.

Weird, never thought I see someone taking up for blockstream in this sub...",1524586808

a way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them.

This is true, but it's not a very good argument. Lunatic asylums are filled with people who ""truly think"" they are the reincarnation of Napoleon/Caesar/Nero/Tutankhamen/... does that make it so?

There's one fact that cannot be just ignored - If you held Bitcoin in 2016 and didn't do absolutely nothing with your wallet/node until today, and you spend those coins, you will spend them on the Bitcoin blockchain, not the Bitcoin Cash chain. This is not something that can be argued about, can it?",1524586169
"This has pretty much been my thinking and my strategy.  And it has worked pretty well, but now that I am about to break even I'm worried about taxes for 2018.

I don't really feel comfortable holding some higher risk altcoins for over a year to get to long term capital gains, especially since they are on exchanges.  Tough decisions coming up.  ",1524586153

Even if you are not a US citizen or a company is not US based, the SEC has very long tentacles and can still cause trouble.  Not to mention, once the SEC sets the precedent other nation's regulatory bodies will follow.  Crypto will no longer be an equalizer.

"&gt; Bitcoin Cash isn't Bitcoin. It's a fork of Bitcoin that hopefully and most likely will become Bitcoin.

That really depends on one's definition of ""Bitcoin."" I guess you're defining Bitcoin as something like the most-worked / economically-dominant chain that traces its history back to the Satoshi genesis block? That's not an unreasonable definition in my view. And using that definition, Bitcoin Cash might be thought of as simply a candidate chain to *become* ""Bitcoin."" Alternatively, one might argue that Bitcoin Cash will *prove to have always been* ""Bitcoin"" when it surpasses the BTC chain by defining ""Bitcoin"" as the chain that ultimately emerges as the most-worked chain.  Others might define ""Bitcoin"" as a the most-worked chain extending back to the Satoshi genesis block *that preserves Bitcoin's essential character as a low-friction (fast, cheap, reliable) electronic cash system*.  By that definition, BCH is ""Bitcoin.""  Still others might consider ""Bitcoin"" to be a general umbrella term that describes all ""Bitcoin"" chains. According to that view, referring to *either* BTC or Bitcoin Cash as ""Bitcoin"" sans modifiers is at best sloppy, and at worst, incorrect or misleading.

Of course, language, not unlike Bitcoin itself, is a decentralized protocol that's highly dependent on the network effect for its utility but that's nonetheless capable of ""forking"" with different groups using the same term in different ways.",1524585862

"Litecoin was released in 2011, it is not 9 years old.

Litecoin was not added to Coinbase until 2017.

I've owned bitcoin but really started out buying a lot of ETH actually and still own some.

BCH will never be bitcoin.  It will always be bitcoin cash, a hardfork created by Roger Ver and Jihan Wu in the summer of 2017 in an attempt to consolidate power and influence and pad their own pockets.  Now they have a ton of reddit and twitter minions who eat up all their propaganda and shill non-facts all day long because they got a air drop of their coin.

You and all these other BCH proponents can say anything you want to say about Charlie Lee.  It wont change the following facts:

2.5 minute blocks are faster than 10 minute blocks.  0 confirmation transactions are a farce and used as a straw mans argument to say BCH is faster than LTC.

158% the wallet addresses of bcash, 184% the 24h trading volume of bcash, and 122% the transactons of bcash, during a BCH pump triggered by AntPool burning BCH - all without a self proclaimed ""bitcoin jesus"" evangelist running around spreading disinformation and lies and attacking anybody in his path.

No, sorry, LTC isn't competing with BTC - and bcash in no way competition for LTC when it comes to the fundamentals of decentralization.

LTC faster on chain and has LN as an option, is clearly more decentralized, can't be confused with the real bitcoin, BTC, and it doesn't need a Roger Ver type person operating in a highly questionable and quite possibly legally fraudulent manner.

Please, reevaluate your argument because all I'm seeing is the same non sensical ad hominem drivel that Roger runs around spewing about everybody who isnt a BCH evangelist.",1524585785
"&gt; The ecosystem needs to be able to self-police

But that's exactly what happened?

"Satoshi was also optimistic regarding SPV security developments, which are still WIP/underrealized.

"I would argue that literally everything you say here is wrong in my own opinion, but I'm honestly way too lazy to go into the depth of each topic so I'm going to summarize my thoughts here:

- There is no *attack* on mining. If you are a part of XMR community, you automatically accept the ASIC resistance principle as this is one of the foundations upon which the coin is based. If you don't like it / think it's a bad idea or whatever, simply don't use XMR. Period.

Same thing with BTC, if you don't like the 1MB cap on the blocks, don't use BTC, use BCH. It's your free choice, find the coin that matches your principles.

&gt;That's a horrible analogy because 95% of btc transactions don't come from ransomware payments

How do you exactly know this? Why, on the other hand, you propose that majority of XMR's hashrate comes from bad actors also without any proof?

&gt;This is false, the premise of the OP is that XMR's 'stated policy' is actually a front for an anti-ASIC, really, anti-mining POV that legacy financial interests are trying to push onto all crypto communities to destroy the backbone of crypto: POW and mining.

Just so you know, PoW != ASIC

Coins which defend ASIC resistance still rely on PoW, lol. Why don't you go around attacking every other Cryptonight coin which has announced that they'll implement ASIC resistance following XMR. Are they all forced to do so by Blockstream, lol? This is tinfoil hat wearing at its finest. Don't get me wrong, I support BCH, but implying that Blockstream is the reason anything you don't like happens is very childish.",1524585525
"Whenever you start to freak out about Btrash, remind yourself: They regard Craig Wright aka Fake Satoshi as an authority. This really is all you have to know about that project.

Face it, youre a fucking idiot that talks out of his ass and doesnt even know what he's saying.  Your positions are poorly stated to begin with, they deal with hyppthetical realities based on your libertarian ideals.  It is you who wants to deal in maybes and possibilities instead of the reality in front of your face.  Bitcoin wouldnt exist without the government creating all the technology beforehand that allows it to operate.  I'm not dealing in potential realities, I'm dealing with this one.

You're the one that has twisted and contorted your positions, especially when you have nothing backing them up and desperately try to cling to something.  You made batshit crazy claims like international trade is anarchic.

"&gt;WCN is a complete joke.  I'll never forget how WCN posted a full panel ""show"" just before the very first Bitcoin Cash price spike, I think it was August 18, 2017 \(or thereabouts\). Each of the guys in turn were insulting Bitcoin Cash, while they were watching the price begin to rise.  They all had their zingers ready, too.  When the camera went to Tone Vays for instance, he said Bitcoin Cash was just going to be a bigger bug splat on a windshield \(or something like that\).  But after that show was posted, and by the time I was watching it, the BCH price had spiked well over $1k.  By this time down in the comments a lot of real people were completely bashing them, \-\-\-Ed\-\-\- for example was destroying the whole panel.

This is pretty much exactly what is happening.  In 5 years, there won't be a Bitcoin (Core) or a Bitcoin (Cash).  There will just be Bitcoin.  (Or maybe neither -- crypto isn't a sure thing quite yet.) Which of the current two forks that will be is still anything but certain.",1524585428

If he can follow through (there are legal/tax issues, sigh) this would be pretty spectacular of him as it's not required.

So I know a lot of people still have a lousy view of him, but I wonder here if Bashco's not out too far on a limb in making a connection between Ver and Karpeles' hiring based on Ver being on the board back in 2016. One could wish for better corroboration of a link at any rate.",1524584948
"Yep.  I dumped all the channels you mention.  I also dropped Crypto Spark.  They have all become a shrine to themselves, sort of like a facebook page.  Not one of them really gets crypto.  You won't hear anything about permissionless, open access to the blockchain and how that is the revolutionary idea. They are far more concerned with subscriber counts, and are therefore are easily purchased.  Ivan seems to butter up Bitcoin Core the whole time.  Crypto Daily is too gimmicky to me, I want less fancy production, more actual insight and information.  Michael on Boxmining is way too naive and just not very deep, he actually live streamed talks from a Bitcoin Cash conference, but then removed the videos.

WCN is a complete joke.  I'll never forget how WCN posted a full panel ""show"" just before the very first Bitcoin Cash price spike, I think it was August 18, 2017 (or thereabouts). Each of the guys in turn were insulting Bitcoin Cash, while they were watching the price begin to rise.  They all had their zingers ready, too.  When the camera went to Tone Vays for instance, he said Bitcoin Cash was just going to be a bigger bug splat on a windshield (or something like that).  But after that show was posted, and by the time I was watching it, the BCH price had spiked well over $1k.  By this time down in the comments a lot of real people were completely bashing them, ---Ed--- for example was destroying the whole panel.  And by the time I had finished watching the show, that video had already been ENTIRELY REMOVED from their channel!  Obviously the bashing got to them. That is when I knew those guys care more about getting approval on the manipulable Internet than actual crypto tech.

That said, I do follow these and some other channels:

* [ChronosCrypto](https://www.youtube.com/user/ChronosCrypto) - Chronos gets it and with his format he can cover lots of topics including Bitcoin Cash
* [Rogue Money](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQe9wLGm0nDlp9faBtvAQUQ) - not crypto specific but occasionally some good chat, and they don't shy away from Bitcoin Cash
* [Decentralized Thought](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMpAklXQxme_wZi3sdHdHVQ) - very helpful and informative, his explanations I really appreciate (not to be confused with ""Decentralized TV"" which is total garbage)
* [Roger Ver](https://www.youtube.com/user/rogerver) - Always want to hear what Roger has to say, plus I'm following the Bitcoin.com channel now
* [We Are All Satoshi](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8aCt-P8D9mU3CMjeKUWQwg) - same with Rick Falkvinge

Bitcoin Cash was created because the development of Bitcoin was hijacked by the Bitcoin Core team. They refused to increase the blocksize or even to provide an alternative scaling solution that would work within enough time.

If you don't like Bitcoin Cash, please don't use it. And a gentle reminder, calling it Bcash confuses you and other readers since Bcash is something else. Making false accusations about Bitcoin Cash such as being controlled by Roger Ver or a scam does not also work unless you can prove it.

"&gt;this sub has nothing to do with XMR really, but since you've posted this here, let's go trough it:

The post is not about Monero, it is about XMR's attack on ASIC mining, you know, the same thing that lead to the hard fork that created the crypto that 95% of this sub backs. So, yeah I take issue with the intimation that this is not relevant to this sub.


&gt;there is no way that the developers can prevent bad actors from abusing the hacked computers for mining crypto.

Its usually bad form to start out a rebuttal with a demonstrably false statement; there is certainly a way they can do that. The same way every other coin does it, they can either rely on the original game theory of BTC as designed by satoshi which leads to ASICs (the centralized nature of which Satoshi mentions and is completely fine with in the white paper), **OR** they can go POS. 

Either way, the statement that there is no way to prevent that is false. And you have to ask yourself, why would you want to use a coin who's stated goal is to remove the one thing that prevents  blockchains from being attacked by state-level actors? ASICs make it prohibitively expensive to attack the network, removing this removes that protection.

 &gt; Do you have any evidence of how many % of the hashrate comes from these bad actors?  This is like saying BTC's price relies on ransomware because victims have to buy BTC is order to pay the ransom to decrypt their hacked computers.

That's a horrible analogy because 95% of btc transactions don't come from ransomware payments, but if THEY DID then that would actually be a correct thing to say. But Botnetmining is the highest efficiency tier of mining just below asics, so in actuality, what the XMR team is doing is not 'preventing asics', they're 'enabling botnet mining', because that is the most economically profitable way to mine monero when you prevent ASICs. The monero devs are smart enough to know this. Hell, so am I.


&gt;This is ancient stuff and was well explained many many times already, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=005hHOZCb0A

Right and its true. Its ancient truth, but most people seem to not know about it. Considering how often the members of your community have called other coins a 'scam', its curious that you are so reticent to discuss the scammy origins of your own coin. Dismissing it as 'ancient stuff' does not indicate a willingness to discuss it. And unlike, say the dash fast-mine, the majority of XMR discussion is horribly devoid of the context of its origins.

&gt;In the end, the title has nothing to do with the post itself. 

This is false, the premise of the OP is that XMR's 'stated policy' is actually a front for an anti-ASIC, really, anti-mining POV that legacy financial interests are trying to push onto all crypto communities to destroy the backbone of crypto: POW and mining.

"**Confidence trick**

A confidence trick (synonyms include confidence game, confidence scheme, ripoff, scam and stratagem) is an attempt to defraud a person or group after first gaining their confidence, used in the classical sense of trust. Confidence tricks exploit characteristics of the human psyche, such as credulity, naïveté, compassion, vanity, irresponsibility, and greed.

"Great questions! Yes, Brave is currently an underdog in the browser marketshare, but the winds are changing! They are currently up to 2 million monthly active users, over 100% increase since winter 2017. The partnerships with these big-name YouTubers like Philly D and Bart Baker are helping immensely on the adoption front.

Your concerns about cost-of-advertising for value-returned due to the small amount of users is extremely relevant. As any startup, you have to smart small and scale up. At this point, we can only speculate on the popularity that BAT ads will achieve. But from my point of view, it's basically saying, ""Would you rather use Chrome that tracks your browsing history and every move reported back to Google, or would you use an open source browser that doesn't track *anything* and still get paid through crypto just doing what you're doing""?

Investing in BAT is a speculative one, but if you are anticipating Brave's success at future disruption (of Chrome's marketshare and Google's ad revenue share), then it could pay off big. The team members have mentioned some insane advertising partnerships are in the works. They are working behind-the-scenes 24/7 to build business relationships as well as developing the Brave software product. That's how they seemingly procured the Dow Jones Media Group partnership seemingly out of nowhere!

I know that me personally and everyone I've heard from in the community are all excited about the BAT ads. Web browsing for crypto and being served relevant ads is an extremely appealing service to try, so I think there won't be too much of an issue with adoption. This will be the value proposition that hits the homerun for Brave in terms of why you would even consider switching browsers to begin with, if complete privacy didn't do it for you already.

As for your questions about the returns compared to Google/FB, that's a question for some of the BAT team members, as they are professionals in the ad-tech industry.

So if coinbase wanted to run a bunch of LN nodes to make money ... they would have to get the hardware to run lets say 10,000 nodes.  Then you need to secure those 10,000 nodes (4000 bitcoin).

Ideally you'd be running them in varying environments ... then you're constantly updating them for security flaws.  Honestly I'd go so far as to design custom hardware.

"&gt;GPUs are already a commodity product, and by nature of having multiple uses will always have greater market penetration.

GPU's are VASTLY more complicated than SHA asics and even in a saturated market with marginal profits, GPUs will always cost a high multiple per watt they consume,  compared to SHA asics .

As illustration, a GTX 1070 has 150W TDP and cost ~$500. That is ~$3.3 in hardware cost per watt consumed.  An Antminer S9, despite still carrying a huge profit margin, retails for $1200 and uses 1350W, almost 4x as much W/$. If/when bitcoin mining market becomes saturated, this will get closer to 10x. 

This is extremely important, because when hardware depreciation is just a tiny fraction of your electricity bill,  you can begin to think about using asics to heat water, heat your house, do whatever where ordinarily you would use electrical heaters. And you can convert excess solar/wind energy in to money, even if your asic runs only 20% of the time during peak supply or low demand period. With gpu's, thats never going to be profitable, because the hardware is too expensive to idle.

&gt;There would be no net change in power consumption.

Thats not what I meant. The issue is not how much energy is used,  SHA mining will in fact, end up using more energy than GPU mining, because its a more efficient way to convert electricity in to crypto's, its simply cheaper per W. But that also means a lower revenue profit per watt, and thus the energy consumed will overwhelming be the cheapest (ie free), intermittent, excess green electricity, and not much more expensive 24/7 guaranteed supply from the grid.",1524583500

"The $1000 spike from 6.9k at 12th of April was likely a result of shorters being forced to close their shorts, i.e. buy back their loaned bitcoins as a result of misjudging the market transition at the end of tax-season.

Bullrun market mechanics often cause sudden spikes. If you combine bulls, traders setting up longs, bots trading and a hungry market with lowered sell pressure, perhaps add some fomo, and spikes just may happen.

Market manipulation exist, especially in a non-regulated market such as bitcoin, it's just hard to extrapolate from the price movement. There are legions of different types of whales, traders and bots doing their own thing, resulting in a price terrain that is sometimes surprising.",1524581718

I don't see the scam anyway.

It's a decentralized world rules by consensus. If somebody wants to consider Bitcoin Cash the ""real"" chain, it's their business/problem, the market will ignore it.

I would argue how that consensus was achieved, but this is beyond pointless, because it was achieved and Bitcoin is Bitcoin, no matter what Bitcoin Cash supporters claim.

If they consider Bitcoin Cash the real Bitcoin, who cares? 

In the end this doesn't matter at all, and don't bring pointless arguments such as ""scam"", there's no scam going on, or ""but new investors will get confused"".

"Programmer here, it blow my mind how susceptible people are to youtube videos/commercials.

People have no clue what the blockchain does. They have no idea what benefits it creates. Blockchain is a data storage tool that is used when you need multiple people to store and verify data.

This is very expensive to do. This is also slow and cannot be made fast without compromising the security. When people talk about free/instant, they are talking a very small network or they are talking about a network without the intense security.

Dont trust anyone here. Half the people here are paid marketers hyping up their small businesses shitcoin. This isnt new, back when libertarians were the only crypto owners, this was happening back then. The libertarians werent technically savvy either, they were obsessed with privacy coins and lambos. 

I dont see blockchain being very useful outside of Currency and Voting. Logistics are cheaper and more flexible when done on central servers. Medical records similar. etc... This is my opinion, and Ive heard some things like Logistics with a thermometer that will null a contract if the contents temp hit 60 degrees. That's a usecase I accept.

My bigger point, be weary of the shilling. There is a reason most people rightfully trust BTC only. Blockchain is only a tool for data storage, we currently have lots and lots of data storage methods. Be skeptical of people who predict black magic out of the crypto scene. ",1524581468

There are a number of OTC (over-the-counter) services that handle larger quantities. Many of the BTC/fiat exchanges have their own OTC desk (although they may not advertise it directly).,1524581407
"One of the biggest issues is having banking facilities work with you as a crypto business. 

Exchanges especially need to know that their fiat on-ramps / off-ramps are solid, but for obvious reasons the vast majority of the banks refuse to work with crytpocompanies. 

The option of operating where these business owners live is not there, they get slammed by security regulators and froze out by banks. This isn't the same as the wealthy elite dodging taxes who are doing so out of choice. 

Exchanges are forced into this situation to merely operate because the banker class is using their paid for government connections to keep them out. ",1524581328

"You're missing the issue.

There is ""Bitcoin"".  This is the original.  It is commonly abbreviated as BTC.

There are many forks of Bitcoin.  Many of them use ""Bitcoin &lt;xyz&gt;"" in their name.  Examples are ""Bitcoin Cash"" (BCH), ""Bitcoin Diamond"" (BCD) and so on.

Calling Bitcoin (BTC) ""Bitcoin Core"" is wrong.  Bitcoin Core is the name of a client that operates on the Bitcoin network.  One amongst many.

This website even then goes a step further and calls BCH ""Bitcoin"" instead of ""Bitcoin Cash"".  The only effect of this is to confuse people who are not familiar with it and potentially cause them to acquire some BCH instead of BTC when that is what really wanted.

Most people don't complain about the other forks that have Bitcoin in the name because - so far - none of them have companies associated that are actively spreading this level of confusion.  Companies associated with the other forks tend to use the full fork name only and will only ever say ""Bitcoin"" alone when referring to the original BTC chain.

I can't speak for anyone else, but if that website would relocate to something like ""bitcoincash.com"" and consistently refer to BTC as ""Bitcoin"" and BCH as ""Bitcoin Cash"", I wouldn't have any negative feelings towards it. (I still wouldn't get any since I have no interest in owning worthless fork coins that don't bring anything useful to the network, but I'd simply not care about it in the same way that I don't care about any of the other forks)",1524581228

Unfortunately there is no bank that allows you to buy whatever you want. It's at their discretion. Most banks allow purchases of crypto from exchanges (for now) and some don't. One of the main reasons a certain bank might not allow the purchase of crypto is that they may face repurcussions if their clients take part in black market crypto use or fraud (same as cash, but some banks may see crypto as a far higher risk from that kind of activity)",1524581165

"Pardon, another user stated it’s legit.

And he’s far more intelligent than your petty soul. Especially when he simply states BCH is the true bitcoin as it follows the white paper which says to increase the block size as needed. That’s his message, that BCH is the true bitcoin that is designed to scale for the entire world without sketchy second layer software on top. The community saw what happens when the block size doesn’t increase, it can take hours or days for transactions to confirm, with fees over $50. BCH has surpassed BTC in transactions numerous times and never faced such a backlog and skyrocketing of fees. At most around $0.02. With 32MB, we will stay more stable and lower. Educate yourself on why the split happened (developers and miners chose to support it, Ver has no say in what crypto exists or not), and what 32MB block max will bring to the currency that BTC has shut out for years.

And ya know, who cares if it’s purely economical. That’s what Bitcoin is. A currency, to be used in the economy. Economic motivation is what drives innovation and better standards of living. It’s why Capitalism works. Have you perhaps never taken an Econ class?

But further on economical motives, Blockstream (who’s taken over your beloved BTC) has publicly stated their goal in “developing” bitcoin is to profit. It’s public. Easy to find. Ver doesn’t control developers, Blockstream does. So how is Ver evil for spreading what he believes, which also happens to be the truth",1524581058

"When I tried Radar Relay for the first time, I executed a market order on Bounty0x. The volume was so low and some expired orders in the order book made me buy at an average of 80c. They're at 16c today.

Before that, when I bought crypto for the first time, I bought bitcoin for about 400$ on Kraken. I transfered a quarter of it to binance which cost me $10 fee.  Then I did it again. Then I changed my Bitcoin to Bitcoin cash and sent the rest for another huge but smaller fee.

I then went ham on binance and bought a bunch of cryptos I've never heard of. An couple of hours later I sold them all, at a small loss.

This was the moment I questioned myself ""Wtf are you doing? You have absolutely no idea what you're doing here.""

So I read up as much as I could and stumbled upon a few projects, mostly decentralised exchange based.

I bought in and then Bitcoin crashed like crazy. I held onto my coins until Bitcoin reached 10.5k and sold everything but a few, with a deficit of 37% to the value of my portfolio.

"&gt; People will hold off unnecessary purchases because they think it'll be cheaper in the future due to deflation. Which causes a drop in consumption and demand on goods.

This only happens if the price drop is so huge that it negates the utility of having the goods sooner rather than later.

Nobody is going to refuse to buy milk, or steak, or vegetables, or electricity, or gasoline, because it might be a fraction of a percent cheaper a year from now.

People don't even refuse to buy computers and phones that might be 10% cheaper a year from now.  If they did that, they would be missing out on a year of being able to use these things, and that year of use is worth spending the money now.

People don't spend crypto because its value increases at a ridiculous pace unheard of with any fiat currency.  People *would* spend crypto if it gained value at a few percent per year.  People would certainly spend it if it had exactly the same value from year to year, which destroys the fiat issuers' ludicrous assertion that currency must lose 2-3% of its value every year (which is to say, half of its value every generation; this is a *catastrophic* erosion of purchasing power).

If fiat currencies were stable, without losing ~2% of their value every year and further widening the gap between the working class (who cannot necesarily afford to put their savings at risk in the stock market or other defenses against inflation) and the rich, we wouldn't need crypto.  If crypto's calue stopped shooting up and it became currency-like instead of an investment, people would be willing to spend it.  Either one would be good for ordinary people.  And people are going to keep flocking to crypto as long as fiat issuers refuse to let their currencies be genuine money and function as a store of value.

&gt; If Facebook could persuade a large enough fraction of Bitcoin users and miners to run its own proprietary version of the Bitcoin software, the company would thereafter control the rules.

&gt; As with Bitcoin Cash, a rebellious few will choose to stop using your wallet and will instead send their transactions to the few ideologically driven miners who continue working on the old Bitcoin blockchain.

&gt; So under those scenarios, would there be advantage left to the original Bitcoin? Maybe it&amp;#039;s the one thing Bitcoin enthusiasts tout as the technology&amp;#039;s greatest strength: Bitcoin transactions are anonymous and impossible to censor.

&gt; Regulators across the globe are scrambling to make sense of ICOs, trying to determine whether they are traditional investments like stocks and bonds-or something else that shouldn&amp;#039;t be subject to securities rules.

&gt; Ethereum, the second most popular cryptocurrency network after Bitcoin, may also be a security, said Gensler, since its token was first sold in 2014, before the network actually launched.

&gt; Is it possible to design a so-called &amp;quot;Utility token&amp;quot; that is solely about consumption, as opposed to investment? If developers sell tokens before a network launches, as a security, can it &amp;quot;Evolve&amp;quot; into something other than a security after the network launches? Cryptocurrency challenges the traditional definition of a security, and some rules may have to be &amp;quot;Tailored&amp;quot; in some way, he said-&amp;quot;But I don&amp;#039;t think it means that we just exempt the whole field and say good luck to investors.""

"You're getting at the crux of the problem - most people don't know what is best for them monetarily. And to boot, a lot of people are going to have a lower standard of living when crypto replaces fiat.

The price going up is what grows the system - it was designed that way. Sure it brings in dumbasses - they make up a significant part of the population so they're is no avoiding that. The inevitable price increases FORCE people away from fiat. That's why Bitcoin has gotten this far in the face of mountains of negative PR",1524579536

"I used the exponential function 1500$ * e^(0.9898 * t), which does infinitely many growth steps (not just 2, as in your example). Maybe I'm using the empirical growth constants in a wrong way. But this way I can solve for 1 BTC = 1 BCH.",1524579526
"Finished reading.

I'll not check every number, I'll just assume the calculations are correct.

If we do huge blocks, 1 billion users, 1 billion transactions/day, 100k full nodes, the whole story, and pay for the full nodes with fees or new coins (do a hard fork to reward full nodes), that would be $2 for each transaction. This is not what we want to achieve (and this state just is not real: no one would do 1 tx a day if the fee is around $2, this state is not in equilibrium, number of transactions and cost of full node fees would be different).

In the end, the problem is:

&gt; And each time an SPV client connects and asks to find any transactions for its wallet in the past day, four full nodes must read and filter 500GB of data each.

I've not checked this info by myself, but if this is true, thats the bottleneck to tackle in ""satoshi's vision"".

I don't know how much work is being done to solve that, but I'm glad we have two networks trying different things. If big blocks is a bust, we'll still have BTC running. There needs to be no hate for BCH if we think of it as a big testnet for a different path foward.",1524579520
"The sad thing is that people were doing this. The crappy thing is, there were those of us that spent $100 per week on it, instantly paid the credit card back.

The credit card was the vehicle in, collect some points to offset fees, then immediately pay the credit card off with money already in my bank account.

Now, I have to just use debit, and some Canadian banks appear to be blocking debit card crypto purchases. The moment my bank does that, I take every single penny out of the bank.

The thing is, we need to make it painful for the banks to take that stance. Once enough people do this they will be forced to play nice. Obviously crypto just isn't big enough yet - but that shows you how early we are in this adoption phase.

The banks that survive the next 20 years are going to be the ones that embrace crypto, and reap the rewards of the migration of millions of accounts to their bank.",1524579505

Induced demand, or latent demand, is the phenomenon that after supply increases, more of a good is consumed. This is entirely consistent with the economic theory of supply and demand; however, this idea has become important in the debate over the expansion of transportation systems, and is often used as an argument against increasing roadway traffic capacity as a cure for congestion. This phenomenon, called induced traffic, is a contributing factor to urban sprawl.

"To quote /u/peter__r:

&gt;Shorter block times increase orphan rates, all other things held constant. Roughly speaking, the average orphan rate is given by
&gt;
&gt;orphan rate = 1 - e-(t/T)
&gt;
&gt;which, for orphan rates less than ten percent or so can be approximated as
&gt;
&gt;orphan rate ~= t/T
&gt;
&gt;where T is the mean block time and t is the average block propagation time to the network's hash power.
&gt;
&gt;If the average propagation time for a block is 6 seconds, then (approximately speaking) Bitcoin would have a ~1% orphan rate, Litecoin would have a ~2.5% orphan rate and Dogecoin would have a ~10% orphan rate.

Sure, LTC might be able to get a transaction mined into a block quicker than BCH, but it has a 150% greater chance of orphaning that block. 

I don't follow LTC, but last I heard at the end of 2017, LTC still supports 0-conf and hasn't implemented RBF. With LTC's orphan rate bring 150% higher than that of BCH, there's a significantly higher chance of double spend against LTC transactions resulting in much lower security. You can bet your arse BCH beats LTC on every quick transaction metric.",1524578297

- OP_RETURN data carrier size has been increased to 220 bytes allowing for more non transaction related data per transaction

- Old OP_Codes that bitcoin-qt team disabled will be re-enable giving bcash some of the functionality that originally was going to be implemented on bitcoin, like simple smart contracts.

Litecoin transactions confirm in 2.5 minutes and hit the mempool instantly, which is the same thing as your bullshit “0 conf transactions” for BCH but much much faster.

2.5 minutes will never be slower than 10 minutes. Neither yourself, me or Roger Ver have the ability to manipulate time and magically make 10 minutes go by faster than 2.5.

Then a couple days later, I leave a few tweets but notice I'm getting 0 notifications, I have a look at a couple of the tweets I did and a couple of them have replies. I replied to one of the replies ( not a follower or someone I followed) and he replies ""why did you delete your comment"" I DIDN'T DELETE ANY COMMENT. Then I went full shadow banned.

Listen, I'm not completely against big(ger) blocks. I am however against fraudulent behavior. Ver is trying his hardest to get people to CONFUSE btc and bch. I will never trust this snake. Not in a million years. If he gets bored of bch tomorrow, the chain will fade into obscurity in a matter of months. 

I am not a ""core shill"" as some might put it. I, and the majority of the knowledgeable base of btc users - those that are familiar with the disgusting politics involved and have a grasp on the tech - cannot support these attacks on bitcoin. And you are alienating more and more people everyday with these fraudulent schemes. You will draw the ire of the whole ecosystem, and you cause will matter little.

"It's neither good nor bad. This is what permissionless environment is. It means brands are not protected and any jackass can fork your coin and claim he is following the original vision and the others aren't and if enough jackasses follow him then the network decides that this ""brand"" has value. 

There is no such thing as real bitcoin. The people decide individually. In case of bcash it has less value than bitcoin (core) but it is much more than zero so some people are fine with that vision which means to them bitcoin cash isn't a worthless knockoff but simply another version (in their eyes, more close to the idea of white paper and therefore more valid).

Don't get me wrong, Roger Ver is batshit crazy but if he believes bitcoin cash is real bitcoin and it is worth more than 0 and some people agree then they are technically not wrong. People who say btc is real bitcoin are also not wrong. This is what permissionlessness is. Anyone can claim whatever they want, in the end the market decides and this decision can be decisive (like the other previous bitocoin scammy forks that nobody cares about which gone nowhere) or indecisive like the BCH vs BTC case.

"I think PoW is superior for PURE decentralization, even though PoS could - once a solid implementation comes in - be its equal. 
DPoS it's too much of a compromise leaning towards 'dem gainz', I think. I still haven't seen a DPoS proposition that gets rid of this. Frankly, I would love to see adoption of a system where the DPoS gives back 0%. In that case, there wouldn't be monetary interests in it (because imo otherwise it's only a matter of who shares the most revenue %, like it is now).

Of course, again, ARK is a big holding of mine, but I make no secret that it literally is the only one I keep for just monetary gains. All of my other holdings are PoW, PoS or DBFT (of which the latter has problems too, but to me less so than DPoS for decentralization). Same reason I would hold Stellar. To me, a cryptocurrency that has no wallet but just a web interface that gives you 'access' to your money through the company database pretty much (look at ripple/stellar), it goes completely against my idealistic stance on blockchain. Just to be clear, I don't hold any Stellar and I am not interested in it. Even though I'm pretty sure there's good money to be made on it.

Market cap I'd argue is low because first of all, ARK PIVOTED their mission/stance at least on a marketing point of view. It was supposed to be THE BLOCKCHAIN TO BIND THEM ALL TOGETHER (which intrigued me at first), now it's being marketed as 'one click ICO/sidechain' or 'the wordpress of crypto' which I find incredibly sad (and that's why as soon as I'm happy with my returns with it, I'll get rid of all of it). It will still be able to connect chains and so forth, but in today's age, there's too many that do that, and instead of playing it strong as one of the first in the field and actually releasing it, they decided to pivot their mission. Meh.

Plus it's taking them forever to get to the infamous 'core v2', which imo has no reason to take that long (source: i'm a developer myself). Again, I'm guessing they switched objectives halfway through. I do not like that.

I have no reason, though, to believe that they don't deserve a higher market cap. Frankly the idea of the wordpress 'one click sidechain' will have a good influx of people buying into it. 
It will get over Dentacoin. Just give it time and actually some solid fundamentals (v2, and actually releasing their darn product).

Reading back, it might sound more like a FUD post! But yeah, I'm just realistic. If you want good money, ARK is a good investment. If you actually in the long haul for the blockchain adoption and tech, I wouldn't ethically reccommend ARK.

As a final note: NEO might have some different problems than ARK. but NEO is actually a blockchain in which future I do trust (yes I also hold NEO) and I do plan on utilize myself.

Obviously everything is just my 2 satoshis :P

The recovery up to over $1,000 again felt like ages, and it really was in ""Bitcoin time""... a couple years, very slow.  Once that price got back to the all-time high again though?  That's when the rocket fuel seems to kick in, apparently.

I'd expect a slow recovery to around $18,000 or $20k and then things might get insane again as it lights a fomo fire underneath all the noobs.",1524577373

"He's not correct... he's very wrong, actually. Here's a repost from r-btc:

The conclusion of the post is completely flawed, /u/MortuusBestia. The complete switch over by hash power is **extremely difficult**, if not outright impossible. Ironically, the reason for this are... fees. Yes, those hated high fees. Here's why.

There are two possibilities for a ""hash migration"". A ""slow"" migration and a ""fast"" migration. In the case of a slow migration, the network will adapt downwards, no problems at all. Just instead of ~2wks, it might be 15-17 days. In the case of a fast migration, though the situation gets more interesting, and we've seen some of that in November last year. What happens is that the txs backlog increases correspondingly fast. And what happens when the txs backlog increases? Fees increase! Which means that the corresponding block reward increases! Hence, miners will not be so keen to switch, especially because the price will never go to $0 immediately. (Unless there's a fundamental protocol flaw discovered, that is.)

Remember when Greg was ""popping champagne""? That's when the fees exceeded the block reward. For one or two blocks, the fees accounted for more than 12.5 BTC. It would happen again. Now assume parity of price - A miner has the option to mine Bitcoin with ~25 BTC reward OR BCH with, say, ~15BCH reward. What will they mine?

&amp;nbsp;

This reason above is one of the fundamental reasons why I support small blocks AND a fee/blockspace market - Network security. Users are, at the end of the day, paying for the network security. Fees are insurance.

i've almost always been ""bigger"" block user, but not too the extent that BCH is taking, off-chain with a reasonable blocksize increase (size wise i am still undecided on) which benefits the user is in my opinion the only way for bitcoin to successfully scale without branching too far from the whitepapers principles of consensus and censorship/money working for the people.

"First of all, the necessity of large hubs is not certain. Time will tell if this is the state that things end up taking or not.

Secondly, there are plenty of businesses that hold a considerable amount of bitcoin that could be used to fund channels. Exchanges, web-wallets, miners, etc... Especially exchanges make sense as hubs, because LN allows for users to have access to near-instant order execution while keeping full control over their coins (in contrast with the traditional model of sending coins to an exchange, waiting for the appropriate number of confirmations and then being able to trade, but with your coins being controlled by the exchange).",1524575956
Pro tip: don't shill crypto to friends and family. Tell them to do their own research and invest at their own risks. It's all good in a bull market but they eventually feel the wrath of the bear.,1524575954
"&gt; Woke up on the East coast to BTC @ $9,300. Good morning on the up and up!

Damn Bro you sleep in late",1524575939
"&gt;but when bitcoin.com gives you info about bitcoin cash

Yes, and the website is **privately owned, not publicly owned** and frankly speaking it's not misleading considering the fact that Bitcoin's development has been taken over by Bitcoin Core and they have crippled it.

&gt;the bitcoin twitter is for bitcoin cash

It was for Bitcoin. The user @Bitcoin learned the history then he started showing his support for Bitcoin Cash. It's also his account so he decides what he does with it.

&gt;and people spam this bullshit that Bitcoin is called ""core"" or ""legacy"", its purely to drive confusion.

And people spam this bullshit that Bitcoin Cash is ""BCash"" or ""BTrash"", considering the fact that BCash is :

1) [A Brazilian payment system that holds the trademark.](https://bcash.com.br)


2) [Its own game token/ICO](https://bcash.games)


3) [A Greek Bitcoin ATM company](https://bcash.gr)


4) [A yet-to-be-launched ZCash-based crypto](https://medium.com/@freetrade68/announcing-bcash-8b938329eaeb)

and this is [BTrash](https://btrash.io). 

&gt;but trickery and bullshit only muddies the waters and hinders adoption.

The trickery and bullshit is done by r/Bitcoin and the Bitcoin Core team, considering the fact that they use censorship in order to survive, while BCH does not use censorship to spread its message.",1524575938
"Miners go rogue and **implement segwit as a hard fork**, then start a zombie uprising during which the bitcoin foundation resettles an start distributing anti-zombie shotguns.

A more **realistic** failure would be some merchants/3rd parties didn't update their nodes in time and 0-conf attacks go rampant against them.",1524575919
"A friend of mine today asked me if I could take my original investment (I'm down perhaps 40%) would I walk away or invest it again?

I told him I would it invest it all again today. 

Crypto is the future and the price will not crash. It will face correction, it will face huge dips, but ultimately the total market cap ahead of if is far greater than what it is currently. 

Family and friends think I'm crazy, but I won't be selling. ",1524575903
"hahaha I was teaching a friend about crypto few days ago... I told him about selll the news and how the market reacts to good news.

Poor guy he couldnt grasb why ¨it is good news when a coin lands a cliend or partnership, no?¨  ... yup, crypto is weird",1524575900
"if dealing with crypto, then it's best to forget fiat-conversions.  it's super hard, but that's the only way to start moving towards crypto-adoption, i.e. not think about the fiat.  
since, we work for fiat rewards, these kind of cryptocribs enterprises are best for miners, where you are spending the crypto that you're mining ('working') for.
i would just prefer different ways of paying, e.g. BitShares, DASH, etc.
( some kind of integration with KomodoDEX for swapping between coins/chains )
",1524575877
"Iranians don't really care what the government is doing. IRR is rapidly depreciating against UDS and the government is implementing these measures to prevent capital flight from IRR. For example, holding more than 10000 USD in cash was made illegal. People are increasingly turning to crypto to save their capital from depreciation. Most of crypto are traded OTC or in unlicensed exchanges. ",1524575876
I'll tell you something else that is really sad. The amount of fucking shit posts on this sub about fucking /r/bitcoin!!! ,1524575841
So it gets so much hate because it is everything that Crypto tries to get away from? It is from banks.,1524575823
"Well, sure, I just don't have any BTC, so that's what I meant. Didn't notice which sub this was.",1524575793
"When you have let's say 85,7 ICX and you want to trade to BTC. you can only trade 85 ICX. So you still have 0.7 ICX on your account (the dust)",1524575788
I bought their Lifetime Bitcoin mining contract before Roger went rogue. Never switched my contract to BCH.,1524575771
"Hello. my name is den, I'm 13. and I want to raise money to buy a car for my mom. It is very difficult for her to manage everything without having a transoptta. and unfortunately I can not work at this age now.

Another prime example of when Core supporters tried to use the government to get their way was when Core Dev and Blockstream cofounder BlueMatt wrote to the SEC asking for regulations in Bitcoin around the time of the SegWit2X fork. ,1524575763
"My hunch is AA accepted funding from Blockstream early on, before anyone really knew what was happening, and he was not aware of the situation he was putting himself into. If he wants to continue to be funded, he cannot bite the hand that feeds him. As Blockstream fades into irrelevance, maybe he'll come around eventually. He *used* to be a great Bitcoin thought leader.",1524575762
"Bitcoin ABC sounds lame. They need a good name progression like Bitcoin Cash Advance, or Bitcoin Cash Money, or Bitcoin Cash Me Ousid How Bow Da.

You could see how this could hurt the Brand and lead to confusion.

I hold majority bch but also hold btc and eth.

",1524575757
You bitcoin cash evangelists are a joke. Calling Bitcoin (Core). No its bitcoin. Its the king. Its the measure of value for every coin. Give up on bitcoin cash already. Nobody cares about it and nobody wants it. This calling bitcoin cash bitcoin is getting fucking annoying now.,1524575722
"You should withdraw all your money from the bank in the form of cash. Then light it on fire to protest the Indian government's stance on crypto.

That'll teach them a lesson!",1524575710
"I will seriously consider selling when my stash is worth enough to buy a house with. And if I don't sell at that point, then once it's worth enough to retire on and live on passive income from safe investments. In either case, I'd keep some and not sell all. 

However, both of those targets are currently way, way out of reach. So for now, I hodl.

Ideally, if I ever reach one of those targets, I won't have to sell the BTC for fiat and can simply spend the BTC directly.",1524575707
"Dust is the small amounts of crypto left over from conducting trades and withdrawals. Many exchanges don't let you withdraw the full amounts, down to the nth digits, so can you can be left with ""dust"" over many exchanges. ",1524575687
It's not going to be used as a currency so why would it? Your knowledge of crypto astounds me. One of those BTC elitists that think it's that and nothing else. If AION was a scam coin it's founder wouldn't be on the EEA with vitalik and vitalik's dad wouldn't be a big investor. Interoperability will take this space to the next level. Keep praying for LN because that bandaid over a bullet wound won't help adoption. First mover advantage is all BTC has left. ,1524575679
Do you not think at that point you could buy what you need with bitcoin directly?,1524575674
"i'm not saying one is better than the other, but when bitcoin.com gives you info about bitcoin cash, the bitcoin twitter is for bitcoin cash, and people spam this bullshit that Bitcoin is called ""core"" or ""legacy"", its purely to drive confusion.  Keep your name, and let bitcoin be what it is. If you want to beat it, earn it. If it is truly the better coin, it will overtake bitcoin in due time, but trickery and bullshit only muddies the waters and hinders adoption.",1524575669
Agreed...  I think we are still vulnerable until the next halvening in 2020.  After that.... with only half the headwind we have now...  BTC will have created so many wealthy individuals they will have the means to defend their investments.,1524575653
Bro. I did it because this is the scenario in India. No crypto transaction via banks at all. Check out the recent RBI stance on crypto. They banned every bank from providing services to exchanges as well.,1524575652
I like to look at extremes then find a middle path. Lets look at 3-4 years out when tech for many cryptos go live. At that point btc may be $10k-30k but all the alts with tech goijg live may see 1000% growth or more which is a good roi. Of the poster was right we may see  more.,1524575649
"The focus of the article is mainly the potential for crypto to circumvent the PayPal ban and alleviate pressure from the sanctions that have brought the Iranian Rial to its all time lowest value, if anyone's interested in reading it.",1524575633
...Or you'll get scammed by bitcoin judas Roger Ver.,1524575614

I'll think about selling when I can just sell for BTC and buy an apartment with that. The reason for this approach is I'm way too busy with shitposting to get to actually know the market.,1524575573

"Literally nothing I said there was trolling, it was all factual. I know you and Roger love your straw mans arguments that are completely unhinged from reality but the facts stand.

Litecoin transactions confirm much faster that BTC or bcash. They hit the mempool instantly and can be considered 0 confirmation transactions just the same as your unconfirmed BCH transaction.

Any representation of BCH as being faster than litecoin - is a complete lie.  The bcash “0 confirmation transaction” argument for instance - is a straw mans argument with no adherence to reality.",1524575524

"I don't think satoshi envisioned the asic's concentrating miners so much. But without validating nodes miners control everything in a return to a master slave network. Think about how easy it is to censor transactions at that point or play games if every wallet must connect to your mining farm.

"That's incorrect. Roger Ver did recommend MtGox but at the end of the day it is at the user to decide what he does in the end. If I recommend to you MtGox and you lost your money, that is not my fault at all.

The hate for Big Blocks was there at first because of the censorship, then the hate came against BCH. They all hated BCH before Roger Ver started saying Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin and this is because of the censorship. Had there been no censorship, there wouldn't be any of this drama. No Bitcoin Cash, No /r/BTC. Just Bitcoin.",1524575411

"Laws and fear of regulation throughout the world. Tax season. Cold feat. Pump n dump. Ico scams. Other scams. Too many junk cryptos. Crackdowns on unknown users (no tracing). Fear of new regulations. Still a difficult entry to market for many consumers. Stock market down turn. Inflation and higher interest. Banks blocking crypto transactions. Advertiser blocking by Google/Facebook (some of it is needed due to scams). Mcafee is a  shill. Normal corrections as people balance investments.

Tons of people buying btc, ltc, eth to buy alt (short term increases big three until they diverse investments). Crackdown on illegal activities such as darkweb and money laundering. 

Too many exchanges that may be less credible. 

Most likely china, korea and india government regulations caused fear in the market for major investors. While in the west major stock investors moving portfolios around and taxes.

"&gt; We know how to do privacy on Bitcoin since 2013

What are you referring to here? I believe this is not true, we have had many ideas but few that have absolutely no tradeoffs.

Be careful you don't fall into the Dunning–Kruger trap, bitcoin privacy and fungibility is *not* solved which is why there's so much research into it.

I think Tor is widely misunderstood for bitcoin privacy. For example people will often connect their Electrum wallet to an Electrum server over tor, thinking it's important. When in reality the Electrum server can still trivially link together all the user's bitcoin addresses and therefore see everything they do in bitcoin.",1524574556

"&gt;Anyhow it's possible whatever model they have used didn't really work with bitcoin FOMO but still I find the idea of banks protecting themselves and customers from crypto risk pretty far fetched. 

Ok, drop the ""protecting customers"" part.  I never said they're protecting you and you're having a strawman there.

You find it a stretch to think they would protect themselves after bitcoin suddenly became a ""get rich quick"" scheme for a sizable crowd of morons in december, and are now defaulting and leaving the banks paying for it?  If the ""cryptocurrency"" category is like 0.001% of their business and the category as a whole became a loss for them, you wouldn't say fuck that category?

&gt;I don't think they care about crypto succeeding. That's why I said political, it has no basis on reality

No, they don't care if it succeeds or fails.  It is based on reality though.  Idiots buy bitcoin on credit en masse in december dreaming of lambos.  Idiots lose their money and default on their cards a month later.  As real as it gets brother.

&gt; Political as in we don't like this shit and don't want to do business in this space, we don't want our customers participating in this space.

That's not political, that's business.  ""we are losing money on this space, we don't like this space, and we don't want our customers participating in this space at our expense"".  

&gt;You could view it as anti crypto message if you will. I don't believe debt related to crypto is a problem or risk to banks.

See, the mistake is thinking cryptocurrencies are getting some special treatment here, that they're really doing it because they somehow feel threatened by it.  That's a bunch of bullshit, and you gotta stop listening to idiots' drivel here man..  

This is NOT the first time this has been done to a category.  Every bank has a whole list of categories that they deem too high risk and want no part of.  The december FOMO/gold rush was HUGE.  Fucking everyone was buying bitcoin.  Idiots bought it with money that they don't have.  Idiots can't pay the money back.  Onto the banks' shit list it goes.

&gt;The reason being they have some acceptable risk model for debt of average joe, ie. i can't whip out 1M debt with my income. That being said it's possible they have identified some problems with this and are reacting, I just find it hard to believe.

They don't just view your debt ratio as the only risk factor.  They very much view certain categories as higher risk than others. Again, they have entire lists of high risk categories that they won't do business with, and that list is always growing and rarely shrinking.

&gt;What i'm trying to say is that they identify your income and assets and issue loans based on this AND they are not sad to see you max out your debt within this framework. People struggling with debt are good customers, people defaulting are bad customers.

Yes, and certain categories they identify as high risk because people participating in those categories seem to default at higher rates.  For example, if you stack up debt buying a $5000 new TV and I stack up debt buying  $5000 of Amway, do you not think one of these categories probably has a higher rate of NOT getting paid back?",1524574467
"Some thoughts.  April 7th was when BTC was hovering around 6600 dollars.  Fast forward 3 weeks, it is at 9310 dollars with 41+% increase.  Let's see how the coins I closely followed faired in this same 3 weeks span.  From order of largest gain to smallest. 

1.  BCH  +148.2%
2.  IOTA  +132%
3.  EOS  +131.1%
4.  ICX  +123.8%
5.  ADA  +118.1%
6.  ENG  +108%
7.  XLM  +104.9%
8.  REQ  +96.17%
9.  XRP  +94.15%
10.  ETH  +87.89%
11.  XMR  +83.24%
12.  NEO  +80.61%
13.  WTC  +80.27%
14.  VEN   +80.27%
15.  TRX  +75.04%
16.  Nano  +59.56%
17.  LTC   +43.12%
18.  BTC  +41.06%

Some thoughts on this. 

1) As expected alts have done quite well.  It is not surprising that BCH, EOS, ADA, etc. are on top given that they rode the bull wave and has big events planned soon.  

2) It is encouraging to see ETH right in the middle here and ETH outgained by BTC by 2x in the same span of time.  Tremendous outlook. 

3) So now, this might be a controversial claim but here it goes.  I can't help notice that WTC, VEN, TRX, and NEO are hovering near the bottom of the list.  And these are all Chinese coins.  Perhaps (again, I have nothing to back this up), the China-US trade wars are having an impact on these coins?  Again, this might just be a coincidence and I don't mean to fud.  

4) I believe Nano is underpriced and ready to go on a run.  ",1524574462

There are many members (a lot more than Core devs) who are competent enough to understand what's right and what's wrong in some aspects, e.g., it is super easy to tell that increasing base blocksize is inevitable at some point. You don't need to be a great chef to know some practices in cooking are good/bad. The community as a whole will make a decision when the time comes.

With that being said, I do have a concern that a hard fork to increase the base block size when it's necessary (or any other non-life-or-death hard fork, e.g., improvements) may be blocked by ""some members of the community"", who are actually enemies of Bitcoin in disguise. They may succeed because hard forks require overwhelming support. They will try to make it like there isn't.",1524574352

"First of all...my first sentence was sarcasm. Let me not use it this time.

Everyone does NOT have the same risk tolerance or same Investment goals. I mostly trade in alts because I'm looking for larger returns. I UNDERSTAND alts are riskier but I am okay with that because I have the risk tolerance for it. Everyone does not. I UNDERSTAND BTC is King and that it's the safer bet, I will even tell friends to make sure they have BTC in their portfolio. 

But my goal here is financial Independence and see the possibility of exponential growth in alts so I take that risk because my Investment goal and risk tolerance align.

Trust me...this is working for me and I'll be good financially even if it all goes to hell.

Lastly, do not throw statistics around that 99% of altcoins fail when it is indeed not factual... you're pulling it out your ass. How does one even define if an alt has failed?",1524573497
"That's not even true dude. Do you even know anything about Bitcoin? 

As long as the network consensus rules are that the first transaction seen on  the network is the one that makes it in a block. A transaction made cannot be undone before it's in the block. So with a 0 conf transaction you have a fraud rate magnituged lower then with fiat systems like Visa, and that's what it is all about.

Hypothetically speaking 1000 confirmations are more safe then 100 confirmations and 100 confirmations more safe then 6. 

But the question is, when is it safe enough that it can be used in practise without having to wory about it and with the best possible trade offs. Yes a 1000 confirmations are really safe. But that safety is not needed for a 10 dollar transactions. And why would you want to wait 10 000 minutes on a 10 dollar transaction? 

And so 0 conf transactions, 99,9999% get confirmed. Which makes it save enough and fast enough.

Everything is connected and it is a worry that these exact methods work to elect heads of states. If that worked, why would social-manipulating people into economical paradigms not work?

"A 1099-k form is the standard form that a third party processors (like Paypal, and now Coinbase) reports to the IRS if you meet *both* of the two criteria; 200 or more transactions and 20k in revenue. For the purposes of Coinbase, each trade counts as a transaction, and the dollar value of the trade counts as the revenue. It doesn't say anything about profit or cost basis, as it is a form the IRS had to come up with in the late 2000s (2009?) to combat the underreporting that paypal enabled for contractors at the time. Once upon a time, it was easy to say 'pay me via paypal' as a contractor (or sell stuff on Ebay) and avoid taxes for your LLC/Sole Proprietor ship.

A 8300 is a form required by the Bank Secrecy Act, and is supposed to be filed within 15 days of taking/making a $10k cash transaction. Because of how crypto works right, exchanges themselves don't (yet) file Suspicious Activity Reports, which is the requirement by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. SARs are the bank equivalent of 8300, and can be triggered by cash/cash like transactions for as little as two or three dollars. If you've ever had to give you drivers license at walmart for purchasing a large amount of money orders, it's probably because they're filing a SAR. A 8300 requires you report cash transactions of $10k to the IRS within 15 days, and by necessity, and time an individual needs to file a 8300 (they move 20k from an exchange to a bank account), the bank needs to file a SAR as well. SARs on 10k+ personal movements attract more scrutiny than SARs on 3k transactions. If you're thinking of breaking up your transactions to stay under these limits, be aware that intentionally doing so to avoid regulatory requirements is a federal crime known as structuring. Structuring is bad for your life, don't do it.

FBAR is part of the Bank Secrecy Act (the same act that brought about 8300s/SARs) and stands for Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (it's backronymed a bit). U.S. citizens with foreign financial accounts &gt;$10k are required to file and disclose their international holdings. Note that this is in aggregate, so $6k at Binance and $6k at Kucoin/Bitfinex still means you need to file. There was once some ambiguity as to if crypto fulfilled the FBAR requirements; I won't give legal advice (and none of this should be construed as such), but I will say that all the big U.S. players I know have now either filed FBARs on their crypto holdings, or have created corporations that hold their funds for them (which requires even more legal hoops to jump through).

"&gt; A fair statement, but there's a lot of evidence and reasoning to show that this would be a preference - at least after the first few months of an ASIC's first successful manufacture. Regardless it isn't important so I'll concede that assumption and move on.

it is important, as control of distribution of ASICS is what makes the miner market an oligarchical market, and also what enables the market to keep functioning as an oligarchy (along with the capital barriers to entry). In any game theory devised model you would have to account for this factor.

&gt; Changing PoW (or other developer-driven counters) isn't a change of chains though. the ecosystem is mostly going to follow the developers unless there's a huge ideological push favoring the miners (which is simply a community fork at that point).

If the cartel of miners refuse to secure the new POW chain, then what? 

Depending on the geo-political context, it may not be a desired outcome for anyone to have a chain half as secure.

&gt;  I'll assume 100% since they want the increased revenue, but naturally this would not be 100% in the real world.

You have to assume 100% as you have to assume that the miners want to maximise profit.

If you don't believe that miners want to maximise profit then you can relax that figure. 

Either way, the scenario i set is that 51% of the hash rate is supporting the move to artificially create a fee market by limiting block size. 

&gt; The next important question is where the businesses and exchanges stand. The main entities running transaction-receiving/sending nodes. Do they back the miners?

We can assume they have no preference. They have the ability to support both chains should a split occur (we saw this previously), and will see time and time again.

&gt; I'm going to assume they do not back the miners as this is an attack scenario we're discussing.

no, the attack scenario is between the miners and the users. the miner know that the users will absorb an artificial limit in the blocksize, and thus orphan blocks that fall outside of the cartel agreements. the exchanges/markets have the capacity to earn money on either chain, post attack. 

&gt; Note: I'm using BTC distribution from your link, even though you said BCH distribution):

yes, my error. its doesn't really matter. its a hypothetical scenario that states a small number of controlling miners/pools can form a cartel. This is true in both BTC and BCH. However, the attack is much more effective in BCH given the non-existent fee market in its current state of play. however the attack is also viable in BTC, i accept. 

&gt; This simple softfork requirement fucks over the attacker's strategy of blacklisting non compliant miners. If they didn't have enough of the other miners in their chain, they'd fork off the network, and their blocks would be considered invalid by the rest of the network.

Your first psuedo code solution would be impossible to work out in practice, and would be gamed - especially by the side doing the attacking. So its a no go. All that would have to happen is a DDOS attack on one of the pools, and chains/blocks would not be valid. It would cause chaos, and could not be implemented in this scenario. 

&gt;but with the other miners being able to fill 8mb of blockspace they would get both the higher fee benefit and be able to pick up a lot of the slack from the cartel's restriction

no they wouldn't, as the cartel would just change their distribution of hashing, and the chain is no longer valid either way. the only solution is a fork. that then means a change of chains for users, which brings costs. 

&gt; *From blockheight N to N+180 days, a block will be considered invalid if its average fee is &gt; 10 satoshi per byte unless it contains &gt; 7mb out of 8mb *

That is still compliant with the attack 

A full block with &lt; 10 sat fees is now invalid. **this is the attack**

**A full block with &gt; 10 sat fees is valid** - which is great as the miners want fees

A half full block with &gt; 10 sat fees is now invalid - don't really care, as these fees will move to the next solved block, driving up the size of fees in that block (and its size) until it meets the criteria to be accepted. 

**A half full block with &lt; 10 sat fees is valid** 

however, the attacking cartel just orphan any block that meets the last condition. they have 51%+ power. so then what?

&gt; But if this game of cat and mouse escalated, the obvious choice would be a PoW change, which would end the attack.

would also create a new chain (which i already stated is costly to change to), and be half as secure. Not an ideal situation.  

&gt; merchants and businesses have begun accepting altcoins extremely rapidly to the point where support for multiple coins is now basically the top priority for nearly every big-name ""Bitcoin"" business

that would have happened already. The marginal cost to accept altcoins is low, whereas the marginal revenue increase is much larger. Everyone thought this movement was about Bitcoin - it wasn't. Bitcoin is just one implementation of an idea. I know you know this, so don't kid us that you don't. 

&gt; FYI, I don't personally buy the ""one group wrestled control"" unless the ""one group"" is more diverse and larger than what is usually implied by BCH diehards. It doesn't matter for my evaluation - the community split, and the damage to the largest / original chain from that split is still being done. In the last 10 days BCH has almost doubled in ratio - quite surprising to me really, but we'll see where it goes.

agree with this.

&gt; Is that what segwit2x was about? I seem to recall it being the opposite...

Whatever your ideology, SW was an update to the protocol. The 2X part, i haven't a notion. I think businesses were sick of the way the system was functioning, and so tried to politick a situation. Big fail.

&gt; My above examples don't require moving chains. 

no, they don't. 

your POW change (the only viable option i see) does. 

So there is no solution, given the condition that i originally set. 

&gt; the scenario isn't an attack so much as a community split, and that's very very different.

no its not, its an attack; realised through an enforced fee market, driven by a cartel of the oligarchical miner market. ",1524572395

"You are thinking way too hard about this...it's more simple (and less risky) than you think.  I spend about 4 hours a day studying release dates and roadmap's of many crypto projects.  Something that is almost always a guarantee is if you buy the hype and sell right before the news/release, you will gain some sort of profit.  When gambling you are just using laws of averages, luck with 0 outside influence for the most part.  In crypto it's very easy to study the human element of ""fomo"" and monopolize on it.  So say i know XYZ has a ""big release"" coming up in their roadmap.  I know that the majority of people on Reddit do not pay attention to anything more than 1-2 weeks out, so once it hit's reddit, i pretty much have already made my profit.

Take PFR (PayFair)...they announced that their nodes will be going live April 30th.  I knew that it would be this this month so i stocked up on PFR when it was only about $0.04 cents.  Within the last week it has gone up to $0.12 as of this writing.  There is still 6 days to go until the platform launches...this is about 3 months in Reddit time when dealing with crypto.  You will soon see PayFair being shilled hard in the enxt few days...more people will FOMO into the project to try to get a node.  I'll sell off all my PFR on the 28th and 29th, most likely when it's around $0.25 give or take.  Once the nodes launch on the 30th. there will be a mass sell off. 

In this example keep in mind i bought in at $0.04...so even if i sold today i can easily say that was a nice profit.  Say i hold until the 28th and i am wrong and it doesn't go to $0.25...i know very well it will not go back down to where i bought it.  So in this situation i would say this not much of a gamble at all, rather understanding the human element of people invested in crypto and on Reddit and monopolizing on it.",1524571672

I am fighting two power, inertia and the big *bitcoin* players that are cosying up with the media in making sure my stories don't get out. They only report on my stories only when they have really have to and can't hide it anymore. It took coindesk two years to write the first story about it: http://www.article78againstnydfs.com/press.php                                  
              
It was not a real problem as long Andreas, Roger Ver, Charlie Shrem, and Company, were not really talking about it. It was an internal fight between me and the politicians. Now Andreas is suggesting that people don't do anything: https://youtu.be/5xihdO7bVZE (Bitcoin Q&amp;A: Criminalization of ownership?) while politicians are clearly going after it: https://youtu.be/JMnhsA2Z_uo

"No, I don't. I have experience in AML and KYC, and have had to learn through personal experience why banks do what they do. Banks primarily want two things - one, appear to be in compliance so they don't get audited, two, manage their risk properly. Crypto is a huge risk (take the money and run) and also very difficult to manage compliance wise; how many U.S. citizens filed an FBAR when the send 10k to Binance, or filed a 8300 within 15 days of sending 10k from an exchange to their bank? Hell many people here were up in arms about Coinbase's 1099-k form despite it being the now legal requirement for capturing and reporting *revenue*.

Not sure if you know how mcap work, irregardless - the mcap for btc isn’t actually 150 BILLION of real fiat. It’ll take far less new fiat buying into btc to affect its price.

"&gt;In this sense, most traders are actually gambling, and each time they take a trade their chance of being right is only 33.33%.

Just a correction, I would better say the chance is 50%, not 33.33%

Right now and for the last 6 hours, BTC rate goes sideways at about +/- 1%. In this case, if I'd bought 6 hours ago, I'd simply wait this range to finish.

When the range ends, you've then only 2 remaining directions; up or down - which is a 50% ""bet"" if you consider it as a game.

TA of a future price may be gambling, yes. 

But TA and other technics to trade may not depend (or less) to chance. Like when you've analyzed the global tendency, you may enter in trade when suddenly happens a big move up (for example), and following the move while exiting at the best moment (with profit).

Yes. It's in the bloody terms and conditions.

What you can (and can't) use money you're borrowing from them on is in the terms and conditions.

&gt; They make money whenever you complete a transaction

Banks make twelve cents per debit transaction. Credit card fees are .5-&gt;3%, and half of that goes to the issuer (visa/mc/discover/amex) and the other half to the bank.

They're a moron. Disallowing crypto is about **risk** and **compliance**. If you want to borrow money and use it on crypto, take out a personal loan of credit, or go with 0-2% APR offers on your cards. Deposit the cash in a different bank account and go from there.",1524569786

It comes down to the way Bitpay implemented BIP70: it causes users to only be able to pay with a bip70 compatible wallet, causing wallet dev’s to either implement BIP70, or lose customers because they can’t use your wallet everywhere and causing confusion at check out when you realize you can’t check out. Also, when you spend BCH at a merchant that uses Bitpay, you’re limited to spending once every ~10 minutes since you can’t spend unconfirmed coins. So if you try and buy something before the next block is found at a Bitpay merchant, you can’t. The user experience of new users paying with BCH is horrible with this process. This is a huge trade off for making life of a Bitpay easier and I feel the community should be less of a cheerleader towards Bitpay because encouraging users and merchants to use Bitpay makes the experience of using bitcoin as cash less attractive.",1524569670

"How confident are you that another coin will outperform the market relative to ETH (not USD) during your timeframe, and by how much?

Speaking as someone who enjoys the irrationality of a bull run, absolutely try to turn every ounce of profit into more profits. Just place good bets! It's all house money anyway! Most people just don't have the *balls* to win as hard as I know you can win! Go get 'em, sailor.

Speaking as an idiot who didn't understand tax implications last year, my real advice is to make less, but more meaningful moves. 10% is nothing. Be sure to subtract the difference between long-term capital gains taxes and short-term gains taxes before you think you've ""met your goals"" at whatever +x%. Let your winners win. When you hit +50% return, sure, shave off a bit to your base pair (BTC or ETH). When you hit +100% return, throw a chunk or all of the profit into another coin (at a good discount at the time), *but make sure that you're going to actually still want that coin in six months/a year*.

Everything goes up in a bull market. Don't make a shitload of small trades, the potential profit of which are siphoned away in ways you cannot see on your portfolio app, by moving your cost basis around so much.",1524568283

The point is that there is very very low correlation between price movements and money flow - especially for markets whose stocks/coins don't have economic factors such as profits, ROI, EPS, PPE underlying the asset. For these cryptos, it's almost 100% fueled by speculative emotion.

If all the holders unanimously decide BTC is worth $100k and there's not a single person who would sell for less, then the moment a buyer comes along and is willing to pay $100k, that's what is worth. 

Same thing if media can somehow convince people that it's worth $6k, and no buyers want to pay any more for it. All of a sudden, the second someone sells for $6k, that's what it's worth.

"I think the question should rather be posed in the opposite direction.

Here's what I mean: consider a simple transaction with 2 inputs and 2 outputs, where all 4 have value 1 btc. This is very artificial but it explains the point. There is no way, even in principle, to assign inputs to outputs. Output 1 is fundamentally not ""from"" input 1 or input 2, and nothing on the blockchain can make that mapping. So transactions are a ""many-many mapping"", all input utxos are 'destroyed' and new utxos (outputs) are created. ('destroyed' in quotes because the data's still there of course; just means no longer spendable).

This is what I mean when I always say to people ""bitcoin has a fundamental fungibility""; that is not to say it has good fungibility, it's to say that this property is fundamental.

Now, there is a ton of academic work already looking at how to trace coins on the blockchain. It probably starts with Sarah Meiklejohn's paper, which lists a couple of very logical heuristics you can use to make assumptions about common ownership (that's basically what a blockchain analyst is trying to do; associate different utxos and claim with some very high probability or certainty that they are co-owned); for example Heuristic 1 is that we can reasonably assume that all inputs are co-owned because that's mostly how Bitcoin software works and the alternative is difficult to arrange. Heuristic 2 is iirc about change amounts.

But let's stick with Heuristic 1 :) The same assumption is made in Satoshi's whitepaper and he states it even more boldly, almost as a fact, which is just false. [Coinjoin](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=279249.0) is simply a description of a procedure to make it false.

Most existing software for 'clustering', i.e. associating addresses as being under common ownership, is based on Heuristic 1 first, and then uses other data (and there is a lot of metadata you can get hold of!) to expand on and improve that, *as I understand*. But this kind of approach is completely busted by coinjoin. It will basically end up with very large groupings of addresses where actually there are a large number of people all being put into the same bucket - due to the erroneous application of Heuristic 1.

Lastly, in Joinmarket specifically, there is an algorithm called ""tumbler"" which addresses the weakness of just ""oh let's do one transaction where coins are joined and we're done"". That is indeed weak for all kinds of reasons. Tumbler tries to address timing correlation and amount correlation. It was somewhat inspired by the description of a ""Clos network"" approach as outlined in the Coinjoin link above. You can read more about the tumbler algorithm [here](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket/wiki/Step-by-step-running-the-tumbler) and [here](https://github.com/AdamISZ/JMPrivacyAnalysis/blob/master/tumbler_privacy.md).

Lastly, bear in mind that there is nearly no one for whom there's an incentive to say anything good about this approach. People running Bitcoin competitors of course will point out the negatives, and of course they'll have a very good point. Blockchain analysis companies will of course brag that they can trace anything, that's their business model (just like IT security companies). That doesn't mean they're wrong. But Coinjoin is kind of fundamental in Bitcoin, as I tried to explain in the early part of this. Later tech like Schnorr interacts with it in very interesting ways, and that's even more true for Confidential Transactions.

Also we're still waiting for someone to trace the final destinations of [these](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/69duq9/50_bounty_for_anybody_recovering_445_btc_stolen/) coins (read the comments).",1524566161
"2 Is the biggest reason why they shouldn't have done it. No crypto is ready for major adoption yet. If you look at it as a game crypto is currently in it's Alpha stage we're slowly going to Beta stage. 

The Verge currency is nothing special and just overhyped like 99% of the crypto out there. The only thing they have going for them is marketing I mean just look at the spam on their reddit page about them begging on twitter to add their crypto as an payment option... 

But hey the flaw of crypto atm is the fact that people see it as a way to make money, it's not about money it's about the technology. The fact that it's about money allows for coins like Verge to gain value if it was just about the tech and not the news Verge would be a dead coin.

It will be a dead coin eventually anyway why because all they do is advertise a Alpha product if Mindgeek aknowledges that Verge is shit and still has major flaws it will lose major value.

I personally can't wait until it starts being about tech and not money. Crypto's like ETH, NEO, ELA etc will see massive gains when that happens",1524566116
"&gt; That doesn't mean that new shitcoin would have anything to do with bitcoin.

You completely missed the point /u/hailsith1s brought up. Your second paragraph stands, but *technically* forks are *variants* of the bitcoin *software/chain*. Most altcoins build upon the bitcoin core software and change it to fit their needs. Some even use the existing chain up to some point.

So you don't see how all the talk about the price going up and HODL isn't basically gambling?  What do you think happens when idiots buy bitcoin on credit @ $19,000 in December, and now they're defaulting on their cards as breaking $9,000 is a celebration?

&gt;If cryptocurrencies start to be considered a viable option as a currency, banks are dead. Nothing they do will work in a world that's run on crypto.

Ok.  The OP is Indian.  Citi seems to be content working with their currency.  Last I heard, they operate in a whole bunch of countries and currencies.  

So, if bitcoin and other cryptos can transition from volatile speculative assets (gambling) to being considered a viable option as a currency... what the fuck do they care if you pay in rubles or bitcoin?  

Do cryptocurrencies make people suddenly not need to borrow money anymore?",1524565918
"My understanding is that there are such applications in the works, something that would pull the latest prices from such or such a source and update advertised product or service rates in crypto. That would seem to fix the problem. Even if I thought my currency was going to, say, double in a year or two, I'd still spend some on a room because by spending it, I'm realizing profit without paying capital gains tax. Plus, spending it is what it's all about! That's how we benefit from owning it! 


But my guess is that some of these Cryptocrib rates were posted before the fall. I compared rates on AirBnB and sure enough, the rates on Cryptocrib appear to be 40% or so lower! About the same amount that prices dropped most recently. Having said that, as a merchant, I can see the logic in basing a rate on the ATH of a currency in the assumption that that ATH is going to be overtaken in the coming months. By honoring that ALT, you're making it more attractive to the customer while still getting coin for your goods or services. ",1524565895

No, your interactions with them is voluntary, they are not forcing anything, They are dictating what terms you interact with them, like any other free business would.

"Your underlying problem in using this approach is the arrows have different meanings, making the whole thing in consistent, sometimes the arrow represents process/time flow, sometimes the arrow represents additional information about another part of the diagram. 

Honestly I don't think bitcoin lends itself to this visual approach. I think you're better off separating out use cases, and referencing them where appropriate. For example, mining is one use case, which, when considering transactions within a block, can make mention of the fact that those transactions were validated and broadcast by nodes. Trying to come up with a single flow-style diagram misrepresents the temporally decoupled nature of the various use cases involved. Consider just a few months ago, a node might verify and publish a transaction that sits in the mempool for days/weeks before a miner pays attention to it. That decoupling is important to capture. The mempool is not a strict queue/stack.

At the time I felt like the gains were too insane the way we were smashing to new records at record speeds (esp. after breaking $10k). I recall the $16k mark was a turning point for me though: I expected it to correct a bit from there, but was amazed it kept climbing up. It was at this time that mu reservations were basically pushed aside by FOMO and I started believing this was normal. Looking back now it obviously wasn't.

So my opinion is that we simply had too many inexperienced people believing in the hype. At the top we simply ran out of new money to compensate for the smart people taking profits. Hindsight is 20/20 though and I have no way of telling in advance when a top or bottom is in, so the best tou can do is expect this pattern to repeat.

* Electrify Asia is creating a decentralized marketplace for energy in Asia.
* Will help both consumers and producers. More choice. More savings. More transparency. Less barriers for alternative energy sources.
* Builds on an existing business running successfully since March 2017.
* Already working product that has produced $4 million since being in business.
* Based in Singapore, the place for innovative blockchain projects. One of the most crypto friendly countries.
* Marketplace will feature commercial retail contracts, p2p energy and conventional providers.
* The ELEC token will allow the producers and retailers to access Electrify Asia’s ecosystem. Retailers and producers will be required to stake their ELEC as a deposit to offer their energy in the marketplace. Transaction fees will also be paid by energy providers using the ELEC token for the usage of Electrify Asia’s smart contract platform.
* Distributed ledger technology will allow every participant to have an identical copy of their contract details, monthly or periodic energy usage, settlement details and energy fees.
* Decentralizes a heavily centralized utility marketplace. Will transform the industry. This is exactly what blockchain projects should be doing.
* Practical use case.
* Will expand to Philippines, Japan, Vietnam and Australia.

**Other stuff**

* CEO, Julius Tan, was featured in Forbes 30 under 30 in Asia. 
* **Founder of OmiseGo**, Jun Hasegawa is an advisor. Jun will be assisting with direction on blockchain scalability and payment solutions for Electrify Asia.
* ""Reason why I’m confident this project, because Electrify has real business going on and that indicate real world business that bring real value to consumer level. Also there is significant requirement of scalability which what OmiseGO solving with Plasma :)"" - Jun Hasegawa, founder of OmiseGo
* Jeffrey Char, head of blockchain initiatives at TEPCO (biggest Electric company in Japan) is an advisor.
* Martin Lim (COO) is constantly putting himself out there, doing interviews and going to conferences. 
* Power Ledger of Asia to put it in simple terms. Power Ledger is Australia only and is 6x the market cap of ELEC.
* ICO went extremely smooth and handled well.

"&gt;If I rephrace the question, today, lots of vendors are opting for several blocks of confirmation before treating a transaction as definitive. I don't think this is gonna be viable if we want mainstream adoption. What is bch:s proposed solution to this problem?

Now this is a good question. But this isn't inherently a problem of BCH, and not really something that is ""fixable""

If  a vendor requires f.e. 6 confirmations he obviously wants the security of 6 confirmations, otherwise he would use 1 or even 0 confirmations. 6 confirmations on BTC/BCH mean on average 60 minutes proof of work and a certain amount of hashes.

If we would lower the blocktimes to 1 minutes, 6 confirmations would be done in 6 minutes only! But this means that there was only 6 minutes proof of work done, which is way less than what the vendor wanted with 6 confirmations. If he wanted the same security with 1 minute blocktimes than with 10 minute blocktimes a vendor has to wait 10x the confirmations.

The problem you described is more of a problem with educating vendors on how 1 confirmation is way more than needed for even big purchases like a cheap car, 0-conf is safe for sub-1000$ amounts because attacks would not be worth it for miners running multimillion-dollar mining operations per day and more than 1 confirmation is only needed for really large transactions.",1524561217

"I agree that future problems are **better* solved when they exist, but still think a framework in which the merchant gets the TX before it is being broadcast, so it can inspect it and report back any errors without the wallet ""locking"" the fund, is important.

If you have 1 overpayment every 2 months, then for 100k merchants, that represent a customer support cost of ((0.5*100k) / 30) = 1600 situations per day.

I don't think bitpays all 100k+ merchants are as active as you are, but it's reasonable to assume that they dealth with hundreds of tickets every day and had a growing trend as more and more people connected and started engaging in the ecosystem. That is a significant cost.

&gt; We've seen the seven-day moving average for underpayments to BitPay merchants fall by approximately 90.24% month over month (12/09/17 vs. 1/09/18), with a reduction of 70.24% in the seven-day moving average for overpayments (12/09/17 vs. 1/09/18).

I say it again, I support BIP70 and Bitpays stance today, because they have no officially documented alternative - if another BIP were available that technically solved their problems without relying on DNS and the X509 certificate system (or optionally used it, but not mandatory) and they still choose to use BIP70 - then I would too be against them.

For now, a new BIP is needed and discussions about it is much more important than trashtalking the businesses that take part in our ecosystem.

I am not a good technical writer, so I've tried to do my part by making the discussion happen, and if you can't write the BIP yourself, at least pitch in to the discussion with your pain points and what you think a better BIP would need to accomplish:

Now when that happens a set a stop loss to buy back in for example if it would go back up to around 8.4k maybe? I need to further look into that. Then i buy back in higher which costs me a couple of percent but on average is worth it because i mininmize risks.

People here know the logic behind all this: ""Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin..."" repeated over and over again by the BCH supporters, and IMO this is the biggest mistake. Instead of spread the qualities (and the differences) of the BCH if compared with the Bitcoin, to have people forming their opinion and finally accepting to join the ""Bitcoin Cash"", someone is using the brute force to inject an opinion and mixing the names, crossing the border of the common sense.

If I go on Kraken to buy 1 Bitcoin, and Kraken will sell me 1 Bitcoin Cash  because it renamed a crypto currency by giving it a different name than the rest of the world, Kraken will be accused of scamming and it will face legal consequences.

BIP70 does not limit use of unconfirmed transaction chains - Bitpay do. For that, I think they are doing a misstake, and I think they will fix that misstake when they are ready. There is a lot of uncertainty that goes into being a company that serves hundreds of thousands of merchants.

&gt; but as a merchant who doesn’t use BIP70, I still have 0 reason to use them.

As a single merchant, with volume in your ballpark and the motivations you have for engagement otherwise, the support costs are not that big of a deal. You can handle the occasional customer doing a misstake and guide them to doing it right.

As a payment processor that gets to take the heat from hundreds of thousands of merchants customer misstakes, it's undeniably a problem, or they wouldn't have implemented a solution to it and documented it's effect on their blog as part of their process of reconciling with the isues of the payment system.

&gt; those are BTC related problems and problems related to merchants not estimating the amount right

Fee estimation ended up being less relevant on BCH, yes, but overpayments, underpayments and other user errors is still benefitting from BIP70.

Even more importantly, future unknown user errors benefit from being BIP70 compliant today.

There has been 0 upgrade/hard fork in btc for improvement since forever, hence the problem has never been addressed and fixed.

Current fees is low because there is less people, that's all, give me evidence of an upgrade/hardfork to proof that BTC has fixed the low free permanently and then perhaps you can argue something valid here.

Most people want to hold usd because they cbf with trading currencies and like the idea of a government-backed currency.  The majority of people either don't care enough about economics to have a problem with central banking, or they do know some economics and think having control over supply is better than not.  As long as people can't see their savings being inflated away in real time, they really don't care.    

I agree it'll probably get easier to trade currencies, but if someone is able to sign up for a forex account now and buy into EUR or whatever, I don't really see a reason why there'd be some mass fleeing out of any country's currency, with the obvious exception of countries with ridiculous inflation.

So if I want to sell stuff on EBay, I might expect to see a net positive of several thousand dollars or more over a year.

Ah, I see what you mean. There's a way to receive money on a channel where you were the only one to lock funds: you spend part of it first, that part moves to the other side and you can receive it back as payments.

Otherwise, if you want to be able to receive immediately, the other party has to  lock funds as well. Maybe they can collect extra fees for that, or some type of interest, I don't know. But it doesn't seem like a hard problem to solve. 

&gt;But there are going to be a huge number of nodes, most of which will be small, poorly connected leaf nodes.

Maybe not, since your fees go down if you're better connected because you have more routing choices.

&gt;But I haven't seen anyone claim that they have developed an algorithm that when tested in simulation allows the Lightning Network to function at thousands or tens of thousands of times of the current size.

Well, the current mainnet has 2000 nodes and seems to be working fine with the current algorithm. Improving it is not the priority for now, stability and security are much more important to get right first.

"I've read it. I don't think Vitalik knows about Ark other than the name of the coin. Most of the points he raises don't apply to Ark.

Coming to the point of trusting the delegates. That's indeed true but there is a mechanism provided to manage that trust. If a delegate screws up you can change your vote at any time. There's no tenure duration or cool down. Also there's an extraneous cost to voting in a bad delegate, which is that the overall value of the whole ecosystem drops and it reflects on your holdings. In the real world if a country's democracy becomes corrupted you can't just pack up and leave to somewhere else. In the world of crypto you just fork the coin and change what you want in order to fix the issues (which is infact how Ark was born). So I'd argue the effect is quite similar to the extraneous cost of electric power spent in PoW and any sane individual will see how that affects them in the long term. For now we don't need to worry about non tech literate people although that issue can easily be solved by implementing liquid democracy https://medium.com/organizer-sandbox/liquid-democracy-true-democracy-for-the-21st-century-7c66f5e53b6f

Ethereum has a similar problem as well. In Ethereum's proposed PoS system only people who hold at least 1600 Eth can become stakers. Out of 30 million unique addresses there are only 5429 addresses currently who hold enough ether to become a staker (multiple addresses may belong to a single person but this is a good estimate since everyone has equal opportunity to create new addresses). As a result things like RocketPool are popping up and you have no way to kick them out from staking if they prove to be bad actors (unless they try to do a double block vote since that's the only thing ethereum's PoS protocol cares about).

In the end PoS tries to argue that governance should be solved with code without creating hierarchies while DPoS tries to argue hierarchies are fine as long as there is true liquid democracy. At this point we don't know for sure which way is better.",1524556501

"What would you prefer me to compare BTC holdings to if not fiat?
Gold? Silver? Black market organs?

I have increased my BTC position by 
1. Buying on the way down and 
2. Trading alts against BTC to gain more BTC. Like a 20% Neo position at 0.0068.

I bought my first BTC at 16k and if I sold everything to fiat now I'd be break even. I am happy with my position.

I wish I understood your critique.

Unfortunately I need to think in fiat as that's what my mortgage company, childcare provider, utility provider ect accept as means of payment.
Where abouts do you live that only accepts crypto as means of payment?",1524554199

"I haven't posted here in a long time, I just checked in for Vegeta memes, so take my opinion with a grain of salt.  But historically, some users of /r/bitcoin, specifically BTC maximalists, are very anti-BCH and have no problem with using smear tactics or attempts at censorship to sway the conversation (looking at you, /u/theymos).

I'm not saying that BCH is completely free of scandals, as I own some of both coins.  Both sides would profit greatly from the hashrate flipping/staying on their side, as Bitcoin/crypto is destined for greatness, so I'm not surprised that people fight dirty over this.  However, I think that censorship is always wrong, promotes ignorance, and runs completely counter to many of the principles of cryptocurrency that drew investors in the first place.

I think it's great that BCH allowed the miners who were advocating for blocksize increase to have their peace, *and* that Lightning Network is finally panning out to be the fee reduction that some people were hoping for.  The fair market is going to decide this battle though, using these kinds of tactics just makes all of the crypto scene look bad.",1524553673

BTC = BCH BTCC = Bitcoin Core,1524553655
"Core has spent almost half a decade now drilling it into their bases heads that hard-forks are evil, infinitesimally larger blocks set in motion a chain of events that will centralize Bitcoin, and the only scenario where a hard-fork would be permitted would be if it were almost entirely uncontentious and achieved near-unanimous consensus. This mythical state of consensus was unachievable even when major players in the Bitcoin dev community like Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn were pushing for it, and the bulk of the community was clamoring for it. 

Now when bulk of the community are hopelessly uninformed because they're reading curated small blocker propaganda on r/Bitcoin, where on Earth would the support for a blocksize increase come from? The most ardent big blockers forked off and created their own coin Bitcoin Cash. The moderates in the community who prostrated themselves before Core and asked for the tiniest blocksize increase from 1MB to 2MB were dragged through the mud and derided with the #NO2X camapaign. They got to watch as Core celebrated with ""champaign"" the great victory preventing a miniscule blocksize increase represented to Core. Big blockers of all flavours got to watch as Core, rather than looking inward to all the mistakes they made that lead to average fees in excess of $55, celebrated with more ""champaign."" 

All these people that Core alienated with their antics are never coming back. No one's who's made a substantial investment in Bitcoin Cash will support BTC weaseling their way out of this suicidal path it has decided to embark on. And BTC's own community has had it drilled into them that if the chain should be forked at all, it should be at some mythical point in the far future, after we've seen what Segwit+LN+Schnorr can do for the BTC network. If $55 fees wasn't a wakeup call for Bitcoin Core I don't know what could possibly serve as such a wake-up call. I don't know how much higher fees can even realistically go. I think people will just stop using BTC in favour of alts like they did during the last fee event rather than letting the fees get event crazier. And when that traffic ramps down, that will just convince Core-supporters that big blockers were just spending tens of millions of dollars spamming the BTC chain. I don't think there's anything that can course-correct Core from this self-destructive path.",1524553633
