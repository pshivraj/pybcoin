"&gt; it is explained in section 4,5,6 and the conclusion. 

Neither of those sections say anything about competing with hashpower. Litecoin does not violate any of those sections.

&gt; there are no official bitcoin authorities. the only decider is hashrate.

Hashrate does not define what bitcoin is, consensus defines what bitcoin is. 

You killed your own argument here. If hashrate defines what bitcoin is, then bitcoin cash is not bitcoin because it doesn't have sufficient hashpower.

&gt; Yes it is, and unlike Core it is one of may implementations of the now Bitcoin BCH chain. 

BCH is a well-defined financial asset, and it's not defined as ""Bitcoin BCH"". Why do you insist on using confusing terminology that differs from the one everybody else uses? Wikipedia, for example, uses my termology. So does every book written. So does every bitcoin exchange except bitcoin.com. And every news website except bitcoin.com.

"**Newspeak**

Newspeak is the language of Oceania, a fictional totalitarian state ruled by the Party, who created the language to meet the ideological requirements of English Socialism (Ingsoc). In the world of Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949), Newspeak is a controlled language, of restricted grammar and limited vocabulary, a linguistic design meant to limit the freedom of thought‚Äîpersonal identity, self-expression, free will‚Äîthat ideologically threatens the r√©gime of Big Brother and the Party, who thus criminalized such concepts as thoughtcrime, contradictions of Ingsoc orthodoxy.

In ""The Principles of Newspeak"", the appendix to the novel, George Orwell explains that Newspeak usage follows most of the English grammar, yet is a language characterised by a continually diminishing vocabulary; complete thoughts reduced to simple terms of simplistic meaning. Linguistically, the contractions of Newspeak‚ÄîIngsoc (English Socialism), Minitrue (Ministry of Truth), etc.‚Äîderive from the syllabic abbreviations of Russian, which identify the government and social institutions of the Soviet Union, such as politburo (Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union), Comintern (Communist International), kolkhoz (collective farm), and Komsomol (Young Communists' League).

"A bitcoin transaction can be broadcast to the network with a fee of zero. Miners deciding to include it in the next block is indeed possible, but highly unlikely given that there's no incentive to work for free.

I tried to include a link to a stackexhange post about this, but my comment got removed by the automod. I'll post the contents of the answer her anyway:

____

&amp;nbsp;

Zero- and low-fee transactions aren't relayed by default. If you attempt to broadcast one over the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network, most nodes won't pass it along for you (and they might even ""ban"" you by refusing to relay any of your transactions for a while). However, such transactions are still valid, and it is perfectly legal for a miner to confirm such a transaction by including it in a block, should they choose to do so. So this raises two questions:

How would they get ahold of a zero-fee transaction, if they're not relayed?

The miner might have created the transaction for themselves. For instance, if a mining pool needs to pay its members their earnings, the pool operator could create a transaction and include it in the blocks the pool is attempting to mine. There's no point in including a fee, because the pool would just be paying the fee back to itself.

Some large miners may have alternate ways to receive transactions (e.g. a web site where anyone can paste a transaction and the miner will consider it). This is also useful for people who want to create transactions which can't be relayed because they are not standard.

Why would they confirm it?

Obviously most miners are motivated by profit and so they would prefer to confirm transactions with higher fees. But other than altruism or bugs, here are some reasons why they might choose to confirm a zero-fee transaction.

It's their own transaction, so there is no point in including a fee. See above.

They've been paid in some other way. Some miners have ""transaction accelerators"" where you can pay that specific miner some amount to ""buy"" faster confirmation.

""Child pays for parent."" If the zero-fee transaction is used as input by another ""child"" transaction which has a high fee, the two transactions together might have a higher average fee than any other two available transactions. The miner can't confirm the child without also confirming the parent, but it might be worth it to collect the child's fee.",1524981170

"&gt; was there a reason non-mining relays were allowed? (you don't have to give a lengthy response, just curious).

They were never ""allowed"" or ""forbidden"".  No one can prevent someone from setting up such a server.

The protocol has effective incentives for each miner to accept new blocks from other miners, to validate all blocks and transactions that he receives, to create only valid candidate blocks, and to forward new solved blocks (whether his own or not) to other miners, as fast as he can can.

Each miner also has an obvious incentive to include in his candidate blocks eery valid transaction that pays more than the cost of doing so (which is very small).

However, the protocol originally did not have any incentives for a miner to forward a transaction that he receives to other miners.  There was in fact a small **dis**incentive: besides the internet bandwidth cost, it would reduce the chance of that miner pocketing the fee of that transaction.

On the other hand, Satoshi was assuming that mining power would be fairly well distributed over thousands of independent miners.  That created a problem.  If a transaction T was known to only a small number of miners, whose total hashpower is only 0.1% of the global hashpower, then T would be confirmed only after 1000 solved blocks (about one week).  

Satoshi could not really solve that problem.  He punted, by assuming that the miners would be mostly nice fellas, so each miner would forward to his peers every transaction that he receives, even before it gets confirmed in a block.  That is, unconfirmed trasactions would propagate through the same virtual network that miners used to propagate blocks.  Then, any user (even if not a miner) only had to know a few miners, and send them his transactions to them.

That solution was against the basic premise of the protocol: that miners could only be trusted to be ""selfish greedy"", and only do things that maximized their immediate expected profits.  But no one could find a solution with that premise, so...

That also brought up the problem of how a miner or simple client could find those miners to talk to. Advanced users could provide Satoshi's program (the original Core implementation) with the IPs of miners that they knew about.  However, the default behavior was to contact a ""seed set"" of Notable Miners, whose internet addresses were hard-wired in the program, and query those for referrals of further miners that they happened to know, and so on recursively -- until the software gathered a handful of contacts that it was satisfied with.  (This is the default behavior now, and I am assumed that it was always so.)

AFAIK the idea of ""fully verifyiing but non-mining relays"" was not discussed beforehand, and never explictly decided.  It happened more or less naturally.  From 2011 on, as GPU racks and pools took over mining, and the difficulty kept increasing, those Elders of Bitcoin found that they could no longer afford to mine, and/or that their hashpower fraction became too small to matter.  

Presumably, real miners excluded those Elders from their peers list, and replaced them with other real miners, in the interest of speeding up the propagation of their blocks to all miners.  The Core software should have done the same. But, instead, the Elders continued to run the software in mining mode: with full validation, forwarding of blocks and transactions, etc -- minus the mining itself.  And those Elders continued to talk to other Elders as if they were miners, too, and refer clients to them.  And the ""seed"" set in the Core implementation continued to be a set of (non-mining) Elders, instead of real miners.

Satoshi's original network had only miners -- who had financial motivation to validate everything -- and simple clients -- who only verified that the transactions that mattered to them had been included in the blockchain by the majority of the miners.  The loss of mining power by the Elders, and their retention in Core resulted in a three-layer network: simple clients would talk to ""pseudo-miners"", that talked to each other and to the real miners, who talked mostly among themselves (where ""talk"" means sending new unconfirmed transactions and solved blocks).  

That development was disastrous, because, while the miners have a strong financial incentive to work ""honestly"", the ""pseudo-miners"" have no incentive to do or don't do anything at all.  In fact, the simple clients have no easy way to check whether a pseudo-miner is working honestly, and no way to punish him if he isn't.  

While a pseudo-miner cannot tamper with the blockchain, he can silently drop the user's transactions instead of delivering them to the miners, and/or hide the majority blockchain from the simple clients and serve instead a minority chain.  If the client happens to talk to malicious pseudo-miners  only, they can block him, or defraud him with .

Moreover, unlike miners, pseudo-miners can be spawned by the thousands at relatively little cost, making sibyl attacks viable.  And, since the ""seed"" pseudo-miners of some implementation are all ""friends"" of the developers, all pseudo-miners that they recommend are likely to be ""friends"" too.  So, for example, a simple client who runs the Core implementation will quite probably talk to Core-friendly pseudo-miners only.

The Core developers should have taken steps to remove those pseudo-miners from the network and try to connect simple clients directly to real miners.  Instead, as mining became increasingly concentrated in a handful of real miners and pools, the Elders of Bitcoin spread the notion that said concentration was not a problem, because the layer of pseudo-miners would be checking the work of the miners and block any mischief that they might attempt.  Moreover, the network of pseudo-miners would take care of propagating the users's transactions to all miners.

To reinforce this new ""gospel"", the Elders and developers redefined the word ""node"", which for Satoshi meant ""miner"", to mean ""pseudo-miner who does not mine"".  This way, it became easier to say that ""the nodes decide"" or ""the nodes ensure the security of the network""

In his whitepaper, satoshi analyzed the security of his two-layer model, under the assumptions that mining would be well dispersed and every user could send his transactions to a sufficient fraction of the miners.  I am sure that no one ever bothered to redo that analysis for the new three-layer network -- because the conclusion would have been most unwelcome.  

Basically, the three-layer design has no security at all.  Since the pseudo-miners have no incentives and no overseeing, they cannot be trusted in any way.  There is no reason to trust that they would try to prevent some ""bad"" action by the miners.  There is no reason to trust that they would not do ""bad"" things themselves (as the UASF golpistas tried to do).  A ""51% attack"" by the miners would entail significant investment and risk for them, whereas a ""0% attack"" by the pseudo-miners could be very cheap and wold have no bad consequences for them.

"Interesting theory. I'll indulge...

If you create a token and give them to companies that use your product, you've essentially created a centralised token economy. Think of it like neopets.com and neopoints. Another analogy is gaming economies where tokens have exchangeable USD value. Secondlife and the Linden dollar. World of Warcraft and gold. But again, these tokens are components of a centralised database.

Yes, the companies and people who use your software have an interest in keeping the network alive. But the ""network"" is no different from a company database. We've been using databases for a long time.

The whole point of blockchain technology (and distributed ledger technology) is to go beyond centralised database architectures. 

https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21677198-technology-behind-bitcoin-could-transform-how-economy-works-trust-machine

The economist article is a great bit of reading to get an overview of the real value of what we are a part of here.

At the core, the value of all of these coins is the value of trust. Combined with the immutability of past events on a blockchain, it is a strong value proposition that we have never seen before. As a society we have always relied on trusting centralised third parties (which scale very efficiently, see VISA, Mastercard) however as we explore the technology we are seeing that moving towards the decentalised side of things may have additional benefits.

Full decentralisation may be impossible to achieve, but I'm a firm believer that as we evolve we will see a middle ground become the optimal pathway.

"This is one of the best comment threads I‚Äôve ever read.

Not that my opinion carries any weight whatsoever but I think the core this conversation comes down to the fact that greed is currently the best way to organize / incentivize humans.

In the USA that‚Äôs why there are legitimate reasons to be liberal or conservative. Greed leads to prioritizing money making (even within governments) which also lead negative side effects (doctors being overpaid, unfair hiring practices, disproportionate salaries). The other end to that sword though is that greed is the only way we can all cooperate...

When you go to work and give up 8-14 hours a day you are doing it because of greed. Or at least a desire to not be poor (whatever you want to label that ). It‚Äôs through that though the companies can ultimately maximize their profits.

Bitcoin as a concept isn‚Äôt truly about financial freedom because the same greed applies. The greed has created this value BUT just like capitalism greed has many positive side effects in this case. 

Bitcoin allows for true free trade and true free enterprise. The biggest hurdle is/was awareness and adoption, the greed to make outsize gains will lead to awareness and adoption. Then we will all benefit ... not necessarily in a world changing way but in a way that creates a lot of efficieny.

"Things I‚Äôve learned in 6 months of Crypto Trading:
I first heard of Bitcoin in the winter of 2016 online from a guy named David Seaman.  Controversial at best doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe the content that Seaman would cover yet it wasn‚Äôt the John Podesta emails or anything like that but it was the commentary he had made about Bitcoin. 
Like everything else he made mention of I  took it with more than a grain of salt to say the least. However in the past year leading up to the fall of 2017 I checked in on this Bitcoin thing. Not knowing really how it worked or really even what it did. 
It wasn‚Äôt until the week prior to Thanksgiving weekend I was really dialed into BTC and was seriously considering pulling the trigger and at least putting my toe in the water with maybe $1k USD.  It was Wednesday and the price was at 8,200 or so, you can check it. Still the noob that I was I had no idea that the markets didn‚Äôt close ‚Äì they were 24/7/365 NON Stop ‚Äì Well I thought I could come back Monday after the long weekend and decided then. Wrong!  By  the time I went to buy Monday  it was like 9,700!!! 
I was in the game‚Ä¶. Now all I had to do was figure out what the heck this game is all about and how it works so with that introduction here is just some of the thing I have learned since then‚Ä¶.

Proof of stake (PoS) is a type of algorithm by which a cryptocurrency blockchain network aims to achieve distributed consensus. In PoS-based cryptocurrencies, the creator of the next block is chosen via various combinations of random selection and wealth or age (i.e., the stake). In contrast, the algorithm of proof-of-work-based cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin uses mining; that is, the solving of computationally intensive puzzles to validate transactions and create new blocks.

"From Wikipedia:

&gt;[Proof of stake \(PoS\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-stake) is a type of algorithm by which a cryptocurrency blockchain network aims to achieve distributed consensus. In PoS\-based cryptocurrencies, the creator of the next block is chosen via various combinations of random selection and wealth or age \(*i.e.,* the stake\). In contrast, the algorithm of proof\-of\-work\-based cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin uses mining; that is, the solving of computationally intensive puzzles to validate transactions and create new blocks.

PoS is the consensus algorithm that Ethereum uses, but there are issues with PoS, which leads to decreased functionality and scalability when a large volume of transactions clog the network. Charles Hoskinson, who is one of the co\-founders of Ethereum, the founder of Ethereum Classic, the founder of Cardano, and a CEO of IOHK, left/was forced out of Ethereum. He went on to start Cardano, and sought to solve the problems that both Bitcoin and Ethereum are currently facing. One of, if not the most important problem is scalability \(ie, the ability to maintain high functionality despite increased network traffic\).Cardano is founded on the principle that, in order to gain the trust of the masses, the fundamentals of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency must undergo rigorous review by experts in the field of computer science to validate the legitimacy of the technology. All of the publications by the computer scientists working for IOHK undergo rigorous peer\-review prior to being published in academic journals. This scientific approach is the closest Cardano can get to ensuring that the technical aspects of their platform are not only sound in theory, but also sound in practice.This past week, Charles announced both on the [Ethereum subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/8f63la/proof_of_stake_is_solved/), and on the [Cardano subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/8f7821/proof_of_stake_is_solved/), that their team has published a solution to Proof of Stake. [Vitalik Buterin](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/8f63la/proof_of_stake_is_solved/dy0z2ik), founder of Ethereum, even validated Charles' claim and challenged some aspects of IOHK's paper, which is completely healthy in the realm of scientific research and academia. If your research findings don't raise questions from experts in the field, then they are likely worth nothing.tl;dr \- Cardano prides itself in being the first blockchain platform to take an academic approach to solving problems in the crypto space. The IOHK developers published a research paper this week claiming to have solved Proof of Stake, a consensus algorithm that Ethereum has been working toward perfecting since its inception.[Composable Proof\-of\-Stake Blockchains with Dynamic Availability](https://iohk.io/research/papers/#AQZE2XCV) \(the publication\)[Video explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCeK_4o-NCc)",1524975071

##Everything MoneroV does ""differently"" is a lie. Here are their claims.

* **On Decentralization**
 * MoneroV claims that Monero is run by one individual and therefore vulnerable. **This is false**. Monero development is freelanced and funded by the community through charity donations, and that can be seen live [HERE](https://getmonero.org/forum-funding-system/).
 * More evidence proving the contrary is how many times Monero has kicked their figurehead off the team: **Monero was created by Thankful_for_today and the community banned him.** It was acquired by Tacotime - Who the community blocked out as well.
 * Also, how can MoneroV have a decentralized development team if 1) it's closed source 2) has A DEVELOPER PREMINE and 3) doesn't invite anyone on the team? Who even audits their code?
 * MoneroV also boasts about their full-time development team. But HMM, somehow it's a decentralized full-time development team..

* **On Supply Cap**
 * MoneroV sites in their whitepaper that the Austrian School of Economics determines that a fixed cap on the circulating supply of a coin is best from an economic standpoint. They fail to realize the following things though:
 * **Because Monero works differently than Bitcoin, THERE CANNOT BE a supply cap**. Monero scales on-chain so they never have to fork to a larger block size. This is done through Dynamic Block Sizing, which relies on people mining for a reward on each block. Monero must always mint new coins for this to work.

* **On Legitimate Mining**
 * MoneroV claims to fight the botnets that Monero allows to allow more competition for legitimate miners using their computers.
 * **Monero has never supported the use of botnets, and has forked to bar ASICs from ruining the network**. MoneroV - Has not.

* **This is not a shitfork like Bitcoin Gold where you just ""Claim free money"". MoneroV damages the network.
 * Because of how Monero works, forking the chain in the specific way MoneroV has chosen to ruins Ring Signatures on both networks for users who decide to participate in the ""Free Coin Airdrop"".
 * Monero is anonymous through the Cryptonote protocol which enables Ring Signatures and Stealth Addressing by default. Over the years, more things have been added on top such as subaddresses and RingCT. This makes the transaction A -&gt; B invisible on the blockchain to an outside observer, and MoneroV still has that.
 * **The issue with re-using the chain is when B is trying to find out who sent it money by only looking at the blockchain**. A -&gt; B is invisible to the average user by stealth addresses, but only to B via RingCT and Ring Signatures. Due to some complicated math I can't get into with a single Reddit post, this risks the anonymity of A in this transaction.",1524974950

- Two token model: VET and VeThor
- VET produces VeThor at a rate which will be adjustable
- VeThor is the ""gas"" used to power smart contracts and transactions on the VeChainThor public blockchain protocol

- **Fundamental value would therefore be the amount of fiat value businesses are willing to invest via regular VeThor purchases (paying rent) or buying a lump sum of VET (buying the house) to obtain the value provided by utilising the network**

Note:

- VeThor fiat value will be manipulated to decrease volatility. Not clear how this will be done but likely through an automated mechanism.
- VET fiat value will fluctuate like all volatile cryptoassets


- I suspect some early adopter enterprises will buy VET (strategic partners such as DNV-GL, PWC, BitOcean etc.) but most enterprises will pay regular VeThor and utilise the VET network via a third party e.g. one of VeChain's strategic partners. In such a way, enterprises will not need to interact with the ""crypto"" side of things (wallets, private keys, opsec) and can continue conducting business as usual. They pay for a service (supply chain tracking) in fiat and the service is provided.

Exactly, they're conveniently saying that TX volume dropped because everyone is ""suddenly batching transactions and using Segwit and LN"". That's pure bullshit. While it's true that a few crypto companies are batching now (which reduces privacy and speed by the way) the TX volume dropped too much, so no, batching Segwit and LN are not the reason.


&gt; It seems a bit of a coincidence that the price dropped in line with the number of transactions. To me it just looks like BTC hit a bit of a Christmas mania and died off in the new year.

This is kinda what happened. Everyone started buying BTC because it was mooning but when the transaction fees went to $50 ~ $100 and BTC price started to go down, people realized the huge mistake they made and started to dump BTC to reduce their losses. That's why BTC price is struggling. People lost confidence.

This doesn't mean that a new hard fork will never happen in bitcoin. \(3 HFs with consensus have occurred in the past [https://blog.bitmex.com/bitcoins\-consensus\-forks/](https://blog.bitmex.com/bitcoins-consensus-forks/) \) A future hard fork with consensus among the most of the economic community could easily happen under certain scenarios \(breakthrough HF proposal with little downsides or protocol bug that effected everyone where some other concerns\(scaling\) where added\) or under other scenarios take more work. 

There may not even be a need to do any future hardfork as we may just decide as a community to scale with sidechains/drivechains or SF upgrades. There seems to be an odd obsession or fear when people discuss HFs as if they have some sort of anxiety that bitcoin won't adapt when if they participated in the development process they would see that bitcoin is changing and evolving all the time.

"Yes, it is.  Its also a bad idea for a few reasons, assuming you care more about the security of your coin than the convenience of rarely misplacing a finger.

Basing a unique private key on a fingerprint makes it lots( &lt;-- append absurdly many repetitions of the phrase "" and lots "" here) easier for a bad actor to find your private key.  You literally leave copies of the key anytime you touch most surfaces.

A quick google search estimates 2^74 probable unique fingerprints.  I feel that might be a high-end guess.  There are 2^160 possible private bitcoin keys with rip-160.  Thats 77 trillion trillion keys per fingerprint.  That destroys the security model.

Also consider, fingerprints are not immutable.  If you suffered damage to your fingerprints(burns, cuts, etc), that would change how a scanner would read it, and derive a different private key.  You'd lose access to your funds.  So you would need an immutable backup, and the best types of backups are so much more secure than your fingerprint that its best to just use them directly...

So, fun idea, but I think if I ever own a bitcoin I'll use a cryptologically secure random number to derive the address from. :)",1524971033

"Thanks for the enlightening history and for taking the time. I knew centralization was one of the reasons for Mike Hearn's rage quit (that, and being bitter about all the crap that was hurled at him), but I never understood the full details. 

Bitcoin reminds me of capitalism. I am not in favor of socialism at all, but I do not agree with many libertarians that a free market _alone_ will lead to utopia. The reality is, a society without both freedom, _and_ virtue, will not work, no matter how free or how well designed. This is true of all forms of government, and was one of the beautiful fore-sights of the founding fathers in the USA. They knew freedom alone would not lead to a good country, but that if a majority of people in that country had a strong degree of virtue (and were able to rule) it might. It's why, contrary to popular belief, many were perfectly OK with and supported religion in the government (swearing on the bible, federal recognition of days like Christmas, etc.), they just didn't want a state _run_ or _mandated_ religion (Church of England).

Bitcoin was designed on the premise that people would be incentivized to have this good virtue through profit. But, like so many things rooted in selfishness, it only leads to finding more profit. It is obvious now from the outside looking in that this would be inevitable.

When you spend your bitcoins from a software wallet your private keys are exposed.

You are probably right that a smartphone encrypted with a fingerprint is going to be pretty much safe for most people, but as I said basically every phone out there today can be remotely rooted.

So it is riskier to store bitcoins in software wallet than a hardware wallet.

If you use an electrum wallet on your PC, all you need to take that wallet from you is to make an image of your PC, wich is easy to do if your pc has been hacked. They can basically copy your entire computer if you have a trojan. Then they can have a clone of your pc and all they have to do is crack your password for the wallet, wich they might have already due to a keylogger.

You cant make an image of a hardware wallet, but you can make an image of an entire PC and just load it and look for the wallet files.

And one of the people who says smartphones have no security is John McAfee, a guy who works with cyber security.

"You act as if shit hits the fan over night...There would be a period of time, perhaps quite a long period, where the USD/fiat will be spiralling out of control and all your fiat savings will become essentially worthless, but gold will be worth A LOT (though in nominal terms it will be worth about the same as it is today in terms of buying power, maybe a little bit more though because people will view it as a store of value during this period). Now, it is during this period that the gold stackers will use up most of their gold, prepping for the eventual collapse they know is coming, buying food and water and supplies with their actual life savings that have stored its value, whilst fiat only folks will have literally nothing with which to do this with.

If shit hit the fan that badly, you'd be a hell of a lot better off with gold, than with crypto currency you can't even buy that many goods and services with right now, and when things get really, really bad you wouldn't even be able to access crypto if/when there is no electricity. Sure, when there's looting and chaos the gold will be worthless, it may even be a liable for someone trying to loot it off of you. But once the pieces are slowly being picked back up again, you know gold will be THE currency of choice yet again. It is why many people who stack gold also stack a decent amount of food and water, and as I said earlier, will stack even more food and water in the weeks before the chaos ensues. But keeping some gold as well for a post-chaos world when things are getting back together slowly.

If you're really expecting complete societal collapse, gold makes perfect sense. A store of value for the early days of the collapse when inflation is running out of control, so you can stock up on the things you'll need to get through the chaos, and keep some of the gold for when things are getting back to normal. Bitcoin on the other hand, I see less value in. It will probably get propped up by hyper inflation, just like every single other asset class, I just find it hard to believe people will be willing to throw so much into something which will be 100% inaccessible in a no internet and/or no electricity era, something that takes days/weeks to convert to fiat in order to buy the goods and services in the earlier days of the inflationary period, such that by the time you actually get your fiat to buy goods and services it is worth far less than when you sold the Bitcoin.

The only scenario for BTC as a store of wealth in a collapsed society is some weird semi-collapse where electricity and internet are still readily accessible by all and BTC has already reached a stage where it is accepted everywhere.",1524964333

Although the market is developing dynamically, there is still a lack of all the necessary tools that will be used to hedge the positions of investors. After all, even the best traders are not immune from any changes in the cryptocurrency market.


What can we say about ordinary newcomers who have just entered the crypto-currency market and are in no way immune to the sudden shifts of the altcoins. That is why the team of specialists created its BITRUST platform to provide an opportunity to ensure its assets and potentially reduce losses in the event of a sudden and sudden change in the market. All this is possible through the use of smart contracts that will contain all information about the terms of the contract, ensure security and the implementation of the agreement. And also to carry out transparent and reliable transactions without the participation of third parties.
In 2017, 179 new altcoins were released, many of which fell dramatically. It is for this reason that BITRUST offers investors to use their platform to avoid such pitfalls and significantly reduce the risks that are often associated with high market volatility. Experts BITRUST believe that the use of this platform will reduce barriers to entry of new investors. And also to increase the amount invested by current participants of the crypto-currency market and for one to increase the liquidity of the altcoins.


BITRUST is a decentralized insurance platform with a simple and affordable P2P, ETH-based, smart contract. The main objective of the project is to have an accessible interaction between the retail trade of crypto-currencies and investors with an average monthly volume of trades from 100 to 100 000 US dollars.

At the current time, of course, various solutions are beginning to appear that are aimed at risk management for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Nevertheless, they are more focused on more experienced traders (various hedge funds and trading houses). This, in turn, makes them very expensive and difficult for beginners of crypto-currency investors.
After all, often, the problem faced by a potentially new investor is associated just with an increased risk of losing the value of particular altcoins. And all because there is currently no transparent regulatory oversight and the main form of investor protection. Therefore, the cost of altcoins is not set by anyone, not counting the market and its participants, who are engaged in trading on exchanges.
BITRUST also offers its potential users a crypto-currency insurance platform, through which investors can bypass and significantly reduce their costs and risks for investment management. BITRUST hopes to bring a special social contribution to the development of the block-community, which will increase the attractiveness of the crypto-currency market as a whole.

A recent study by the British firm Autonomous NEXT has about 68 crypto hedge funds, which are actively involved in the development of the crypto-currency market. Basically, they use the traditional investment strategy in ICO. Nevertheless, although specialists have recorded a significant growth of these crypto hedge funds, they are still at the initial stage of their development, in comparison with traditional hedge funds.
¬†
Though with every day the market is developing and developing, it is still just beginning. And a person who wants to delve into this ultra-dynamic market, there are difficulties, because it is difficult to predict any fluctuations in the market. On the basis of this problem, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãits solution arose, by creating the BITRUST platform.


The BITRUST team is firmly convinced that crypto-currencies have a number of advantages over Fiat. At the same time, they look at the current state of the market from several sides, namely: the capitalization of the crypto-currency market, the types of wallets used, the number of participants, the problems associated with exchange and security, and the presence of large players.

The platform itself is officially registered by BTF Project Limited, which plans to launch its launch no later than January 2019, if it will certainly raise enough money after a token.
¬†
 I think the idea of this project is very necessary for investors because I myself am an investor. In the future, I will enjoy using this platform with the help of which I could save myself from losses and risks associated with a sharp drawdown of altcoins

Therefore, if you are a beginner or a practicing cryptoinvestor, I recommend that you familiarize yourself with this project in more detail:

* Making shielded transactions default and improving UI
* Wallets for the merchant payment solution \(prototype is done\)

Yes, I am. Kudos to you for realizing and acknowledging it.

As stated above, I have continued to care about both Bitcoin and the truth, regardless of how unpopular both of these things are around here.

I self reflect on a daily basis, and it does help in a number of respects; I recommend the habit.

&gt;Did you always want to be a dictator of the protocol

Have you stopped beating your wife?

&gt;or did you once believe in it for libertarian reasons?

I believe in plenty of things, and the NAP is a very good rule of thumb that I philosophically support; describing me as a ""libertarian"" is fair enough, even if it is a simplification. I believe in (and fight for) Bitcoin for a number of reasons, and libertarian belief-sets do overlap with this, to a degree.

But I do choose my own full node software, and that's enough to make my economic node, attached to an IP address, a force to be reckoned with.

That's what prevents other nodes from cheating, miners or not.",1524960270

"Each side is looking back at the past to justify their actions around the time of the BTC/BCH split. Each is also assuming that neither side is capable of or planing to continue development of their coin because it will eventually fail and go to zero. I.e., 'dead coins' have no plans.

This is simply not realistic. Neither side is monolithic and there are already signs of fracture insofar as the civil war is assumed to be over. The politics of revolutionary movements almost guarantees it. Until you get one or more strong leaders there is going to be at least semi-chaos no matter how undesirable this is.

Because they can. Same reason why ATMs have fees. The people that go to this machine are doing so for the ease-of-access or novelty. In either case, they're willing to pay more in fees. 


Cost to operate is definitely higher than a website. Not sure what you mean by third party. The machines are by Blockchain BTM which is a private company.

Do you consider gold more valuable than the USD? Cause I'm sure you'd be able to find more people that would except gold, than BTC.

**Description:** Responding to criticism by  attacking a person's perceived favorability to an out\-group or dislike  to the in\-group as the underlying reason for the criticism rather than  addressing the criticism itself, and suggesting that they stay away from  the issue and/or leave the in\-group.

Over 35 years that I invested in gold, pretty much every time it looked like it was going to increase in value there'd be a big sell off to suppress the price again. Once the dust settled, I'd find that no-one actually sold physical gold, they just moved wads of paper on the stock market. There is far more money in the ""gold market"" than there is actual gold.

"The backing of a currency isn't the problem. Currencies can be backed by nothing and still exist as long as people agree they have value. 

The problem has never been ""is bitcoin valuable"". Bitcoins were fine when they were worth pennies. 

The problem is crypto currencies are a commodity currency fueled entirely by speculation. The real value in crypto is hoping it rises over time by magnitudes with little effort.

Which is fine for an investment. Its a stupid high risk one but it is an investment. 

The problem is currency wants to be stable, reliable, and steadily increasing marginally. Economies favour predictable currencies over erratic ones. 

And without a general AI with a complete world model manning the production of crypto the lever is either in the hands of an algorithm that can't be left alone to manage the coin or an organization that cant be considered objective in how they run the coin. 

At the end of the day crypto is not decentralized. Crypto still has a mint. The only thing is the process allows independent mints to form they just become part of a pool of minters. The mint will still decide how much currency exists. 

And because of how the economics of mining works, you will get a centralized private mint. 

Currencies need less and less printing done as time goes on. In some cases they diminish currency before going back to minting surplus. That's the nature of economies. They don't scale linearly over long periods of time. 

As such mining needs to get more expensive to accomplish over time. Which reduces the margins of the coin. As this process repeats more and more miners are knocked off as their scale is no longer economically viable. Eventually one firm mints all the coin in the currency and noone can touch them. The economy eventually reaches a stasis where the numbers are kept just above what would shutter the Minter but not too much as more would kill the economy. 

To do anything else would flood the economy with too much currency and devalue and crash it. 

Again. Speculation is what drives value here. Not use as an exchange. So if it stops being a good investment they VC pulls out. 

Eventually when the system weeds out all but one minter you reach the problem. 

Your decentralized currency consists of two entities. An organization to determine how much coin is needed. And an organization that will mint as much coin as said org allows. 

""Decentralized""

The technology is amazing. 

The implementation does not live up to the ideals. ",1524957146

When r\bitcoin started banning A LOTpeople from participation - mainly, people who disagreed with Greg Maxwell - all those people, and there are literally thousands who got banned, they started this sub to talk about BTC, but without the scared control freaks like Greg.   

Over here, they talked about how shitty it was for BTC to be banning opionions, censoring thought, controlling the ideas of its users that way, and changing the project, then creating a ""scaling problem"" and proposing the One Official Solution(tm).  

When BCH came along, it was clear.  Thanks largely to the censorship, but also the new fee market over at BTC, and also the coordinated attacks against good people like Roger Ver,  the entire uncensored community now prefers Bitcoin Cash. 

But don't worry, we definitely do continue to talk about BTC.  Mostly about how messed up it is.  Have you tried to use Lightning yet?  It's supposed to be the solution to BTC's artificial ""scaling problem"" but you may not have even tried it because it's terrible.

Even the seconds required to transfer a couple of MB of data today are pretty crucial  when it comes to mining competition.

Additionally, if bitcoin is going to remain government proof, then the data needed to run a node must be easy to obfuscate, and must not be easy for any large institution to block or disrupt.

"1.  You need an account with Request in order to pay the Request.  It's essentially like paypals system but with a variety of payment options and lower fees.

2.  It being account orientated helps with the accounting nightmares you're talking about.

3.  Losing their private key is the fault of the user and if funds can only be refunded to that address then so be it, again, fault of the user.

3.  If you paid for something when Ethereum was at 600$ and requested a refund but Ethereum rose to 1200$ you would simply get 0.5 Eth back and not the full Eth.  

4.  Not sure if you can use two addresses to pay the same request if your bill is 1 eth and two accounts you hold have .5 each.  I would highly doubt it if they would as that further complicates things.  If anything it would be two different transactions each stemming from each of the wallets.  

5. No need for manual entries of payment details.  Purchaser signs up an account, inputs his wallet for payments.  Seller does the same but also includes what's being bought in the details, all automated, just like Paypals receipt system.

I get what you're saying about Bitcoins Lightning Network and all but with that you're only ever sending and receiving Bitcoin.  The beauty is that Request can perform all of Paypals duties to a tee without issue while making tx cheaper to use and allowing users to send and accept the currency of their choice.  LN Is not capable of that in anyway and actually sounds like it takes more work and less simplified for just sending/receiving BTC as a payment in a retail setting.

"&gt; If stolfi was just another schmuck on the internet like you and me, I'd say no problem. But he wears his identity and his credentials like a shield of armor. Once you want to use your educational and professorial credentials as a demarcation of superiority, then you place yourself on a pedestal. When you then resort to name-calling, belittlement, and refusal to answer uncomfortable questions, then your credentials lose any importance and your whole presence in the debate is unbecoming of the title of ""professor"" of anything, IMO.

Yeah okay, some comments have been out of line. This has been a heated argument. 

&gt;Edit: ""if you show any respect for Craig it means you know nothing about math or CS"" is exactly the problem I have with him and others. This idea that knowledge is actually a process of identifying the correct authority figure who is right about everything and aligning one's beliefs with that authority figure is BAD SCIENCE. Good ideas often come from shitty people. If you can't hear a good idea because of the person who said it, then you have left the path of knowledge and taken the path of politics instead.

This is a difficult point for me in particular to respond to, because after my deep-dive into CSW's writing when his critique of SM was the hot-topic on this sub, I'm pretty convinced that the gist of what Professor Stolfi is saying here is correct. Namely anyone who is technical and leverages their technical knowledge in understand what Craig is saying, will realise he is authoritatively spouting nonsense he shields with technobabble. I think you're under the impression that the reason Craig is so often criticised by technical people is because we're all gate-keeping and straw-manning his positions because he is inarticulate and often misuses technical words due to the wide-breath of his knowledge. I can say from first-hand experience that this is untrue. I'm willing to do whatever it takes to steelman Craig's arguments and be arguing against the strongest version of them, right up until we end-up in the domain of religious apologia: where any religious contradiction, either intratextual or an external contradiction stemming from scientific facts, is just a challenge for the faithful to resolve with creative and outlandish interpretations. [See jstolfi's brief critique](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8cmq15/nchain_releases_nakasendo_royaltyfree_software/dxi2g6u/) of Craig's SM paper for an example of yet another Craig argument that requires theologians to rescue it--let's not even start on SM itself please. 

 As I've said before, I find your belief that CSW is some kind of misunderstood genius utterly perplexing. The fiercest supporters of Craig on this sub usually fall into one or more of these buckets:

1. Their thinking cap is an actual tinfoil hat. Every conspiracy theory is obviously true regardless of how unparsimonious the conspiracy theory is and how little supported by evidence it has. Usually they lack the technical knowledge to see through Craig's BS, but if they have it they have constructed an elaborate explanation as to why Craig *chooses* to present himself as a charlatan.
2. They lack the technical knowledge to see through his bullshit, and they're impressed by all the big words he uses. He tends to say a lot of nice things about Bitcoin (BCH), in particular he makes bold proclamations and promises that no one else is making, and that makes people feel good about their BCH holdings.
3. They're actual paid shills. There's a bunch of people who I strongly suspect, given their antics, that are employed by Craig. Arguing with them about Craig does not feel like arguing with a human being, but rather with someone whose financial well-being in some way depends on never giving an inch even when they have no rejoinder to an argument advanced against Craig, or a hole exposed in their argument.

You don't fit nicely in any of these buckets. So you're an interesting case.",1524955640

"&gt; it's very few that are described in the Bitcoin White Paper that are rooted in the ""The Times"" genesis block from 2009

The whitepaper only specifies that a genesis block exists. It doesn't specify which block is the true one. Litecoin does not violate anything in the whitepaper, and ethereum only violates section 9 which discusses an an unimportant implementation detail.

&gt; BCH distinguishes itself from the other forks in that it competes with BTC for hashpower. 

And the whitepaper mentions that where? It does not.

When Namecoin used to compete for BTC hashpower, did people call namecoin bitcoin? No. They invented the term altcoin for this purpose.

Are there other coins that compete with BTC for hardware. Yeah. Are any of those ""bitcoins""? No. They are forks of bitcoin or altcoins.

&gt; Bitcoin Core is a way to distinguish Bitcoin BTC from the other Bitcoins. it's not derogatory like ""bcore"" it just highlights the network that follows the reference client that is knows as Bitcoin Core. 

Bitcoin core is derogatory, just like btrash. There is no currency named bitcoin core. Only bitcoin.com and /r/btc pretend that there is because they have a vested interest in confusing people.

&gt; Bitcoin ABC is also a Bitcoin implementation that does not follow the Bitcoin Core reference implementation, thus those Core Fundamentalists call it not bitcoin, when in fact it's just not following the Bitcoin Core reference implementation rules as defined by the Core developers. 

BitcoinABC is not a bitcoin implementation. BitcoinABC is a fork of bitcoin core and an implementation of a Bitcoin Cash node and wallet, you could also use the term cryptocurrency wallet. 

&gt; actually it is not often used as a wallet the wallets don't define the network, the miners who write blocks to the blockchain do, BS/Core are the sacred keepers of the consensus rules that the miners use. they need to stay compatible with Bitcoin Core to be called Bitcoin hence calling Bitcoin BTC bitcoin Core.

Bitcoin Core does not define what bitcoin is. Consensus defines what bitcoin is. At this point in time, bitcoin core is one of the many wallets that are compatible with all bitcoin consensus rules.

It is exceedingly difficult to counterfeit large quantities of any major currency. Maybe it's even harder to do with BitCoin but it hasn't become so massive a problem with traditional currencies that this is some huge differentiator. 

When people are criticizing the dollar and the federal reserve system, ""it's too easy to counterfeit"" is rarely an argument I've ever even seen attempted.

In the end, it's all fiat currency that only has value if there's someone else willing to give you a good or service in exchange for it.

And for BitCoin, there is no one entity out there that is guaranteed to always accept Bitcoin for goods and services. Some individual business may promise to do so, but businesses go bankrupt and cease to exist all the time. 

For the American Dollar, you can be certain there will always be one entity that will always accept the dollar. That is, the Federal Government. And since everyone has to pay taxes, and dollars is the only form of currency the IRS accepts, as long as the US exists and taxes exists you know for sure at least one very large entity will always accept dollars.

You aren't wrong. If we are comparing bitcoin to alts or investments with a similar supply and inflation rate, then yes, a lower price means less money is required to increase the price. But it sounds to me like you are making an argument for putting money into alts simply because they are cheaper, and I think there is really very little about most cheaper coins that make them likely to stick around long term. I think you have to assume quite a bit in order to claim that a lower price makes it more likely that some other investment will go 10x before bitcoin does - especially if we are talking about an 8 year time horizon. 

In the larger scheme of things, Bitcoin is still actually very small, and being the largest cryptocurrency makes it basically the only one with the sort of liquidity necessary for much larger investors and institutions to really begin to get involved. It has multiple network effects working for it, it is the most secure and immutable, and there isn't much that the world needs more than a sound digital money. 

Government fiat currencies have on average a ~27 year life span, and every time one fails whole populations starve to death, or go to war, or otherwise have their lives completely turned upside down.

"&gt; I expect more than 1% per year to be lost.

That would be great, as long as it is not you who is losing the coins...

&gt; [The centralization of mining] fact did not effect the value of anyone's coins.

AsI said, the holders spun around it.  However, decentralization was supposed to be the ONLY advantage of the bitcoin payment system over other payment systems.

That advantage came at a great cost in all other aspects -- computing cost, convenience, speed, security, reversibility, privacy, legal support, etc.  Without that only advantage, bitcoin would obviously lose the competition against those other systems (as we have seen in the last 5 years).  Then it should have lost its market value, that was ostensibly based on the expectation of widespread adoption.  

Therefore, if holders were rational, they should have viewed the centralization of mining as a much worse blow to their investment than the hypothetical raising of the 21 million cap.

Rational holders should also have dumped bitcoin when it became clear that the 1MB limit would not be lifted and that the capacity would be forever limited to 4 tx/s.  ",1524954117

"Hello everyone, due to the fact, that in the comments are various opinions about the taxation of cryptocurrencies, we would like to give you some information how the German tax law deals with cryptocurrencies (only for private persons). First we must make a distinction between the VAT and the income tax.

VAT:

In Germany cryptocurrencies are not subject to taxation. This statement has been repeatedly confirmed by the German Ministry of Finance (BMF). Please don‚Äôt confuse the VAT (Umsatzsteuer, USt) with the income tax (Einkommenssteuer, EStG). Cryptocurrencies are only tax-free in the context of the VAT.

Income Tax:

In Germany cryptocurrencies are classified as economic assets. Cryptocurrencies are, even though the name consists it, not currencies. Furthermore, they are not financial assets. In Germany we have a special Paragraph only for financial assets (¬ß 20 EStG ‚ÄúEink√ºnfte aus Kapitalverm√∂gen‚Äù). At the present moment no cryptocurrency is a subject of taxation for the capital gains tax. The profit or loss with cryptocurrencies is regulated by the ¬ß 23 EStG ‚ÄúPrivate Ver√§u√üerungsgesch√§fte‚Äù. If the time span between the purchase and the sale is smaller than one year, you must pay taxes on your profit, but you can also realize your losses.

If the time span is bigger than one year, the profit is tax-free. Furthermore, when the interval between purchase and sale is longer than one year, it is not allowed to offset profits and losses. If your profit is smaller than 600 ‚Ç¨, your profits are tax-free. For calculation you must sum up all your profits within the ¬ß 23 EStG. If your profits are greater or equal to the tax exemption limit (600‚Ç¨), all your profits which were made within one year are liable to tax.

In addition, we give you a short overview about the taxation in Germany:

‚Ä¢ No VAT for cryptocurrencies

‚Ä¢ No Capital gains tax for cryptocurrencies (¬ß 20 EStG)

‚Ä¢ Income tax for profits (¬ß 23 EStG):

o If Time span between purchase and sale is smaller than one year

o If The total of all profits within a year for ‚ÄúPrivate Ver√§u√üerungsgesch√§fte‚Äù is greater or equal 600‚Ç¨.

‚Ä¢ Personal tax rate (up to 45 %)

The most important thing is to record every transaction in case the tax authority wants some transparent information about your profit or losses. We created a Tax Reporting Application where you can report your taxes across crypto wallets, trades and exchanges. In addition, the tool will create an official tax return document for the country of your residence.

If you are interested in the taxation of more specific issues (Forks, Proof of Stake, Masternodes etc.) please visit our website and check our blog under https://cryptotax.io.",1524952096

I don't agree with this at all. The message in the genesis block was ""Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"" - an implicit complaint about money printing, and bitcoin being an alternative store of value is a very important part of the vision.

"&gt; You mean they are both cryptocurrencies. There are many copycats of bitcoin,

it's very few that are described in the **Bitcoin White Paper** that are rooted in the ""The Times"" genesis block from 2009

BCH distinguishes itself from the other forks in that it competes with BTC for hashpower. 

&gt;There is no crypcocurrency named ""bitcoin core""

Bitcoin Core is a way to distinguish Bitcoin BTC from the other Bitcoins. it's not derogatory like ""bcore"" it just highlights the network that follows the reference client that is knows as Bitcoin Core. 

Bitcoin ABC is also a Bitcoin implementation that does not follow the Bitcoin Core reference implementation, thus those Core Fundamentalists call it **not bitcoin**, when in fact it's just not following the Bitcoin Core reference implementation rules as defined by the Core developers.

Also add in the fact that major services were not taking advantage of simple things like upgrading to Segwit addresses allowing more tx to fit in each block, and tx batching combining many outputs into one tx. So the normal congestion from hype along with spam exacerbated the situation, and many people were so impatient that they paid such high fees.

"**Anarcho-capitalism**

Anarcho-capitalism is a political philosophy and school of anarchist thought that advocates the elimination of the state in favor of self-ownership, private property and free markets. Anarcho-capitalists hold that in the absence of statute (law by centralized decrees and legislation), society tends to contractually self-regulate and civilize through the discipline of the free market (in what its proponents describe as a ""voluntary society"").

In an anarcho-capitalist society, law enforcement, courts and all other security services would be operated by privately funded competitors retained by private property owners rather than centrally through compulsory taxation. Money, along with all other goods and services, would be privately and competitively provided in an open market.

"&gt;EOS will be extremely centralised. 21 nodes is a paltry sum. Non-full-nodes will not have any way to do lightweight verification, thus multiplying its degree of centralisation.

Another person who uses words he doesn't understand. Centralized refers to the notion of a single person or entity having majority control in a system. As all 21 delegated nodes will likely be unrelated to one another given the token distribution method and high degree of competition, this makes the system completely decentralized. Here's a good article Dan wrote about decentralization a few years ago: http://bytemaster.github.io/article/2015/01/09/How-to-Measure-the-Decentralization-of-Bitcoin/

&gt;On top of all of this, the 21 full nodes will be delegates, which are voted in. By necessity, this turns consensus into a political process instead of an automated one. One of the practical effects of this is that the delegate nodes will be known/trusted third parties.

Correct. This makes the nodes accountable for their actions, and puts them at the mercy of the network. If they misbehave, they get thrown out. 

&gt;To sum up, EOS will be a trusted third party based ledger.

The only thing that requires trust is the network's integrity as a whole. You don't need to trust the one node owned by the Chinese government, or the one node owned by Bitfinex. You only need to trust that the nodes aren't colluding. This is identical to the way Bitcoin and Ethereum work right now, in that you need to trust that the nodes forming consensus, most of which belong to a small handful of mining pools, aren't colluding with one another. Only in that case, there's nothing you can do about collusion aside from a hard fork.

&gt;TTP-based ledgers do not have the high assurance of immutability of permissionless Byzantine fault tolerant ones like Ethereum. Therefore, they're not as attractive for new projects as a platform to launch on.

Both immutable and mutable contracts have use cases. If I were a software developer who planned on writing, say, a decentralized Facebook, I certainly wouldn't want my code to be immutable. Immutability only works for very simple, straightforward software. Not for the types of software that EOS is being built for, such as everypedia and EOSfinex.

&gt;EOS is more like an attempt to create an evolved version of the traditional centralized server-client architecture rather than an attempt to introduce a paradigm shift like Ethereum.

EOS is an attempt to combine the decentralization, reliability and redundancy of the blockchain with the speed and usability of centralized systems. ",1524948636

anything bitcoin was is not here anymore.

i really still cannot believe that there is even a question about whether BTC or BCH is better for daily use.

"If you are plebs living outside paradise, i.e. non-US and non-EU, the answer is no, there isn't. Check out cex.io. They have a service to withdraw btc ""to your debit card"". This is supposed to work worldwide.  It is actually a wire transfer, but with a twist. These type of international wire transfers, legal abroad - to -physical domestic entity would be stopped and banned by banks, but in this case, the bank sees this transaction as coming from visa, with some additional metadata in the tx about the origination which has a well-hidden cause. The downside is that if you are from a country that has a financial sector from a stone age (most of the world shitholes, including mine) there is a high probability that the bank's core system will not be able to process this type of transaction (""withdraw directly to debit card"").

I agree with that.

No.  Again.  You don't understand how this works.  The entire reason Bitcoin is revolutionary is that its owned by nobody, and everyone has 100% power to decide what it is.  Its called consensus.  Right now BTC has that concensus.  It may not forever.  And that is exactly how its designed.  You are literally rejecting its most basic, and important tenets because for whatever reason, you dont agree with them, or see the value in them.  But you are one thousand percent wrong.

False.   Completely and utterly false.  I know for a fact that you were not here, and you do not know how this played out.

"While you do bring up the point that some coins might be worthless and have no value assigned to them, I'm assuming that with the relative ease of forking a project and improving upon it, would certainly reduce the price of the previous iteration. Forks are easily the greatest threat to Bitcoin. I understand that it is not identical to the original, but this in *essence* is printing more crypto, given that you receive an equal amount of crypto from the fork. We have clearly seen a struggle between Bcash and Bitcoin. Bcash is evidently also assigned a fiat value and can still pose a threat to Bitcoin so I'm not exactly making any assumptions. I can see problems further down the road if this were to continue as the indecision among investors with their limited fiat cash will have to decide what to bet on. Even if the entire ecosystem rises, Bitcoin's price could be still worth more if those crypto never existed since it would be proportional.

 My main point is the supply of crypto being affected by the limited quantity of fiat that the vast majority of people possess. As I mentioned before, the higher the price of Bitcoin goes in its fiat value, the poorer we become, given that late adopters either by choice or even by the misfortune of being born too late will miss out on buying Bitcoin cheap to own a significant share, again with their limited amount of fiat cash. The early adopters essentially become the new versions of a central bank because they control the majority of it and can thus dictate who they give it to or what they use it for. ",1524946843

Additionally, it‚Äôs wise to keep in mind that Bitcoin moves control away from governments into the hands of few early adopters/miners controlling well over 70% of the world‚Äôs mining power. At the very least, governments are accountable for their actions by stakeholders, meanwhile; in a decentralized, anonymized ledger the main shareholders are not held accountable. 

There is nothing wrong with improving the current system 21st century tech and having an open-source, fully-transparent ledger that holds all member parties accountable. With Ripple, the trade-off is simple. Want to save money? Want to increase cross border transaction speed 10000-fold? Want to not have to have trillions in overseas nostro accounts? And do you want to keep up with your competitors that have already joined the ecosystem?

"That is what all Ethereum experts and believers used to say about the idea of modifying smart contract.  And you saw what happened.

And note that ""code is law"" was the absolutely essential principle that justified Ethereum's existence.  

That is not the case of bitcoin's 21 million cap.  The fixed cap has been a big selling point for those who turned it into an investment scam, but for Satoshi it was only an embellishment.   The essential feature of bitcoin, the only one that justified its existence, was to be decentralization.  That feature is totally independent of the issuance policy, and of whether it is bounded or not.  The investment scam itself On the would probably have arisen, and would survive just as long, if the issuance were to be changed to 1% per year, forever. 

On the other hand, bitcoin stopped being decentralized in 2013 or earlier; and that outcome could have been predicted as early as 2010, when GPU farms and mining pools were invented.  Yet few faithful were turned away by that fact.  They promptly spun the tales that it was not the miners but the ""economic majority"" that controlled bitcoin, and that the non-mining relays were representatives of that majority, and that as long as there were a couple thousand of them the network would be effectively decentralized.  With is all total bullshit -- but was enough to keep the dead whale afloat for five years, and maybe another five.",1524945807

The fact Bitcoin went to shit could be attributed to the Cash people, who needed to a, stand their ground for big blocks and b, not try to subvert the good name of the original Bitcoin when they didn't get what they wanted.

"Here is a thought.  Why would Vicky side with BCH?

Please correct me if I'm wrong cause I don't linger on forums and I don't watch these debates like it's 1993 Bloods vs Crypts; however it seems that ETH was sold for BTC and thus has a significant stake in the success of BTC over BCH.

If people were to fully believe that Wright is Satoshi and that BCH is the TRUE Bitcoin then the demand for BCH would likely sky rocket devaluing the Ethereum holdings of BTC and thus the company overall. (Most likely to a significant extent)

At the same time Vicky couldn't transfer the large amount of BTC they have to BCH without negatively affecting the supply and thus price. (most likely) Again, losing a significant amount of value. 

So, regardless of course they lose if BCH is the real deal.

"The truth is that **BCH is at least as much Bitcoin as Bitcoin itself**, everything else is really just a matter of opinion.

Is ""Bitcoin"" the system which most closely resembles the ""goal"" of Satoshi, as discerned by what sum total of opinion they left behind?

Is ""Bitcoin"" the system which most operates ""most closely to the whitepaper""?

Is ""Bitcoin"" the system as described by a ""majority"" or a ""consensus"" of humanity?

Is ""Bitcoin"" the system which is defined by an arbitrary rule, such as the highest difficulty chain, exchange price, total transactions, or daily tx volume?

The facts:

""Bitcoin"", as described by the ruleset which enforces 1MB blocks, SHA256D PoW, and the ~21M token cap (etc etc), is defined as being a deprecated network as all notable development is being done on optional-use side protocols (SegWit, LN). Typically traded by the ticker BTC.

""Bitcoin"", as described by the ruleset which operates the upgraded DAA and allows for much larger blocksizes, is being actively developed by dozens of teams in numerous directions with notable development currently being done on core protocol improvements alongside processing efficiency and throughput enhancements on client-side systems. There are a growing number of dev teams working on new interfaces and new use-cases for the core protocol rather than focusing on optional enhancements such as ""LApps"". Typically traded by the ticker symbol BCH (sometimes BCC) and colloquially known as Bitcoin Cash.

So which is ""the real Bitcoin""? Seems to depend more than anything on who you ask. Perhaps that's the way it should be.",1524944376

"You mean they are both cryptocurrencies. There are many copycats of bitcoin, including but not limited to bitcoin gold, bitcoin diamond, bitcoin cash.

There is no crypcocurrency named ""bitcoin core"". Bitcoin core one of many wallets that can be used to transact bitcoins over the Bitcoin network.

The image you are linking to is silly. It's missing the most important concept which is consensus. Bitcoin cash exists only because they knew they had no shot at getting consensus, so they went for a minority fork and they called themselves bitcoin cash.

"&gt; Sure, but Forex has insane volume, tight spreads, and low volatility. Trades are very short term, seconds or minutes. People are trying to make fractions of a percent with each trade. It takes massive amount of leverage to make any money because the movements on currency exchange rates are so small.

I think you have a bad idea of that Forex actually is. It isn't seconds or minutes it can be days or weeks if you know what you are doing with swap. On such small timeframes it is usually bots that are doing it or scalping type traders (which is hard). 

You can lose your entire stack in Forex, because those currency pairs can actually move quite a lot, especially on news events. Just cause we are moving from 1.10 to 1.11 doesn't mean you can't lose millions when you have a leverage of 100 or more.

During a news event you can lose all of your money in a few minutes if you bet the farm.

I am not saying these markets are the same, but what i am saying that you can easily fuck up just as much.

Everything depends on the **capital you are risking.** I have traded 1:5 margin on crypto and the losses aren't so huge if you don't put 40% of your capital and don't trade on 5 minute timeframes.

"&gt; EOS is a private centralised permissioned chain, ethereum isn't.

you clearly don't understand EOS.

It is not private, it is public. Everyone can read blocks and transactions, everyone can submit transactions to nodes on the network. Please explain how its private.

It is not centralized, nodes are voted in by other token holders and can be voted out and will lose stake if they do anything malicious. Nodes can disagree on what makes a valid chain. EOS is arguably less centralized than Bitcoin is (and has proved to be) due to mining pools centralization where right now conceivably two pools could conspire to take down Bitcoin.

It is Permissioned (assuming that means not everyone gets to participate on consensus) but that's because that's how DPOS works at any given time, it's not any less a public decentralized blockchain compared to other blockchain consensus designs where permissioned == centralization. With DPOS if you get the votes you get permission, so it's not permissioned by a centralized authority.

&gt; Ethereum could easily switch to private networks with 10 nodes 

Yes of course, Hyperledger is already doing that for instance, but EOS is not doing that so the comparison is wrong. 

Bitcoin and Ethereum's shared flaw is their POW based consensus. Ethereum are trying to fix it with a move to POS, EOS have moved past that problem already with DPOS.

&gt; Ethereum can maintain the fully permissionless, decentralised, open public blockchain and still obtain high TPS with sharding

A type of digital currency in which encryption techniques are used  to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer  of funds, operating independently of a central bank.

Please explain to me how that is not confusing. Differences: Core vs Cash.

0.01550474 BTC vs 0.10408716 BCH

One decimal difference. One letter difference. Its hard to tell which one is more even looking closely. Decimals are hard to decipher for most people. If you do not know that there is a difference between cash and core, which you certainly would not know from [bitcoin.com](https://bitcoin.com), you would not even not even bother checking for the difference. Even a knowledgeable person could easily purchase the wrong coin by mistake because they are nearly identical buy pages. 

If you are a layman that wants to invest in bitcoin and go to [bitcoin.com](https://bitcoin.com). All the front page tells you is ""The Bitcoin Core \(BTC\) network is in trouble due to high fees and slow  transaction times. Bitcoin Cash \(BCH\) is the upgrade that solves these  problems."" That would obviously suggest that BTC is the old dated model, and that BCH is better. A currency website should not try to argue which currency is better. [bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org) certainly does not, nor mention any other coin for that matter. Why would they?

[Bitcoin.org](https://Bitcoin.org) also does not provide a purchasing service. That is good, they are a currency. Currencies should be attained through exchanges, not home plate. That is not ethical. Instead they link you to the exchanges in which you can purchase them from. At [Bitcoin.com](https://Bitcoin.com) they obviously they sell their own product. ",1524940960

1. Bitcoin Cash forked before SegWit activated. So clearly, Bitcoin continued on as before, whereas Bitcoin Cash introduced a consensus breaking change and created their own altcoin in the process.

2. The whitepaper talks about Bitcoin being the chain with the most PoW done. Bitcoin Cash is the ""shorter"" Blockchain in terms of PoW, so even if they hadn't changed the rules and Satoshis difficulty adjustment algorithm that was meant to kill off minority forks, they'd still not be Bitcoin.

3. Bitcoin Cash has had its miners attack the network, producing 100,000 coins in the process. This was a bug in their new difficulty adjustment algorithm, allowing them to create blocks far sooner than ever 10 minutes, without an increase in hashrate. 
So in a way BCH showed us what happens IRL if we support a cryptocurrency that gives too much power to mining pools: They'll abuse that power to gain monetary advantages, even if they have to break their cryptocurrency in the process.

A block's ultimate validity is probabilistic. Any block at the head of the chain is at its lowest possible probability while still qualifying as a _potentially valid_ block. The probability that such a block would be further confirmed despite violating rules previously enforced is entirely in the hands of the miners. If a majority agree to do so, their decision is no less valid than their previous decisions on which blocks to confirm.

"Yes but the foundation of a companies price per share has a backbone of statistics and underlying value. Stocks are priced with intrinsic value based on fundamentals which allow for a greater gauge and smaller margin of error. Additionally, with stocks ur buying a share of the company.

To a company they hold value as a vehicle for fund raising. 

&gt;  But for a utility token we would expect the present and future value of the coin to be reflected in its MC the same way as a company‚Äôs profits and expected profits would be tied to its MC. 

I disagree. We have no reason to believe a coin/token to be a direct reflection of the company‚Äôs progress or profits. Especially since most projects are not generating revenue...yet. If they were a reflection of the company‚Äôs progress then updates and progress reports would likely move the price which is simply not the case. ",1524939231

"Maybe, but the scaling limit is far higher than they want you to believe. BTC has a maximum block size of 4 MB, depending on segwit usage. Currently the maximum possible is as low as 1.2 MB. That was higher than the mean block size when Bitcoin network was clogged, by the end of last year.

But what will happen when Bitcoin Cash have the kind of demand to fill 1 MB blocks? Nothing, because the block size limit is 8 MB, thus, we already have more than 4 times the capacity of Bitcoin, assuming full segwit usage. In May, this number goes to 32 MB, more than 16 times the capacity of BTC.

Then you may ask: will BCH suffer some side effect of having 8 MB of data that BTC avoided by having this effective limit of 1.2 MB? In other words, how big can be a block so that Bitcoin Cash will keep working as it is now? The truth is, we don't really know. I am sure it can handle perfectly well blocks of 100 MB. People of Bitcoin Unlimited have experimented with 1 GB blocks, and at least one guy made his argument that Bitcoin Cash can handle [1 TB block right now](http://blog.vermorel.com/journal/2017/12/17/terabyte-blocks-for-bitcoin-cash.html)!

I looked up the [vice article](https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/7x7pwd/crypto-currencies-are-in-fixed-supply-and-thats-a-problem). It's short and quite shit IMO. They say 'This is a major problem because if prices keep falling people will stop spending and hoard their money because they think it‚Äôll buy them more later on.' At some point, you need to spend money to live. Saving something that's going to increase in value in the long term seems great to me. The alternative is to save for retirement only to find that some government has QE'd your money into the dirt.

You should think very hard about your point 2. Especially this part... 'why is creating a new coin an antithesis for fixed supply? If every single coin has fixed supply, then all of them together also have fixed supply.'

I'd agree with you that some tech might inhabit some realm that Bitcoin (BCH) is quite bad in, and in these cases, I think it makes sense to create a new coin. Not a new coin for each new service as you see with the ERC20 tokens. This is human greed.

"&gt; is intended to be set some arbitrarily large amount higher than the typical run rate of the network

No questions there.  You could have lifted that from some comment of mine.

&gt; Therefore, the condition of exceeding the block size limit under non-attack conditions boils down to one of two things: 1. a miner misconfigured his mining soft limit and mined a big block 2. a miner misconfigured his block size limit and refused to accept a reasonably sized block

The ""mis"" in ""misconfigured"" means ""wrong"".  So what are the ""right"" values for those parameters?  How does a miner know that it has the ""right"" values?

Forget the soft limit.  It makes no sense to set it to less than the hard limit.

&gt; Just like the 8.1MB block reached a quick convergence

I lost count of how many times I explained to you that the 8.1 MB branch was ignored only because there was a **minority** of miners who acccepted it.  You still refuse to consider what would have happened if a **majority** (but not all) of the miners had accepted it.  No, it would not ""quickly converge"".  

And you still refuse to understand the concept of ""validity rules"" and the profound difference between ""orphaning"" a block or branch and ""rejecting"" it because it is invalid by those rules. 

&gt; some clients (like BU) have strategies that prevent that

I could not get Peter to provide a clear and precise definition of the BU algorithm.  The ""description"" that is out there mixes a ton of philosophy with the description, and then leaves out important details.  

One thing I have understood, however, is that BU would let two branches grow by many blocks before deciding to change its own block size limit and switch to the branch with ""too big"" blocks, if it keeps growing faster than the ""right size"" branch;  

Thus it seems that its goal is merely to adapt to changes in the block size, forgetting that the purpose of the protocol is still to process payments of users.  It would be a disaster for them whenever the BU client switched to a bigger block branch, dozens of blocks after that branch started.  

It seems that the BU algorithm has never been tested in an adversarial situation; or, if it did, the testers did not care about the effect on users at all.

&gt;  ABC or other clients that do not employ an elastic limit would require the miner to perform the ""elasticity"" function ""manually"" by tweaking the limit upward.

How long do you think that it will take for the human manager of an ""ABC 8 MB""  pool to notice that 60% of the other miners are mining a branch that started with a 9 MB block?  

All ""ABC 8 MB"" miners and clients are supposed to **ignore** that branch **because it contains an invalid block**, no matter how long it is or how much hashpower it has.  Just as they will ignore any BTC block, even though it has more hashpower than the BCH blocks.  Or just as they would ignore any BCH block with 50 BTC of reward.  

""Ignore"" there means really ignore -- not ""keep the block around just in case"", or ""ignore unless many other miners accept it"", or ""call the human operator and ask him what to do"".   Therefore, the ""ABC 8 MB"" nodes will *never* warn the operator that there is an 8.1 MB chain being built, and that it has 60% of the miners.  

Can you see now why a chain split by ""huge block"" would NOT ""mend itself""?

&gt; Again, this is profoundly unlikely.

There was at least one miner who had a limit larger than 8 MB.  How can you say that it would be ""profoundly unlikely"" that such miners would be a majority?

Even if you assume that nearly all miners will be using ABC, how could you say it is ""profoundly unlikely"" that none would set a limit to less than 8 MB?  If **one** of them set the limit to 4 MB, and some other miner created a 5 MB block, that miner would go off mining a branch of his own, totally ignoring -- not ""orphaning"" -- the branch mined by all other miners.  

&gt; When the limit is hardcoded, as we have seen evidentially, it creates an instant political lever and places control of that lever in the hands of developers.

Development is inherently centralized, because all miners must agree on all the ""validity rules"" -- not just the block size limit, but also the protocol version tag, the block and transaction format, the hashing algorithm, the  reward schedule, the difficulty adjustment algorithm, the max transation size, and zillion other rules.  

No one has been able to imagine a decentralized way to define those rules and to coordinate changes to them.  Therefore, each community that wishes to transact through a common network must choose a head developer, and submit to his decisions. 

The ""block size war"" did not happen because the limit was explicit in the code, but  because in Feb/2013 a certain guy proposed a radical redesign of the system, which required permanent congestion of the network; and he managed to convince some investors to back that plan with 50 million dollars or more (to Blockstream and other companies).  

With that money, that man was able to force the miners to accept his rules, which included keeping the 1 MB limit, SegWit, and several other changes (as ""soft forks"").  Even if there were no explicit size limit in the code, that man would have added one -- because congestion was essential to his design. The 1 MB limit only made his goal easier, because he was able to convince most bitcoiners -- including most big-blockers -- that the purpose of that limit was to limit normal traffic.",1524938531

"As others have said why wait until May 5th.  All that means is more people fall victim.  If you have already done the research and you are ready to present your evidence, why wait?

It's very hard to convince people the coin they invested in is a scam.   Every piece of evidence you present, someone has an explanation.  How can you present legitimate facts and not be accused of spreading fud.   One person's evidence of wrongdoing is another person's fud.  It's very difficult to convince a true believe, in that regard many of these coins are like cults.   Even if civil or criminal proceedings are initiated there are still those that refuse to believe anything negative about their coin.

This feels alot like the same strategy alot of other crypto projects employ.   Announce some big upcoming news, let the hype build and then make the announcement.  I am not saying you don't have anything, just saying you are doing the same thing everyone else in the  industry does, legit coin or not, which in my opinion hurts anything legitimate you have to say.

It says, hey, look, I've got crypto on me. Sure, you can buy a trezor and keep it in a bank vault. Or you can do the same with your iPod or smartphone. Why have a special hardware wallet if you're not planning on carrying it around? Hmm? You have yet to answer that.

Again, you are mistaken.

""Bitcoin Core"" has never incorporated a hard forking change, though you could argue that ""Bitcoin QT"" did, with the updates in 2013 corresponding to the BerkeleyDB to LevelDB switch, because of the (user-configurable) lock restrictions in BerkeleyDB. Of course, if you customized your BerkeleyDB settings specifically to accommodate high simultaneous lock counts, you'd be able to sync with the chain just fine even with Bitcoin software from 2010.

Depending on the amount you buy and from which seller you buy, you (don't) have to verify your identity which is what I came to this site for. When looking for sellers it also shows the amount of orders they had processed and reviews other people gave to them which is how I determined their legitimacy. Once you've found a seller you like with an offer you like you can start the buying process by clicking 'BUY' which then directs you to a screen where you can chat with the seller and where you will find info about what to do. After having completed the payment (the seller will have put his BTC in escrow by then) you can press a button to tell the seller and localbitcoins that you did. Once the seller has received your payment (this can take multiple days depending on your payment method), the BTC will be released from escrow onto your account.

There are some fairly intelligent people, that are not software engineers, who have fallen for core propaganda and are convinced that doing tx on chain can't possibly scale up without bitcoin failing in some other way. 

Maybe they are correct, only time will tell, but in the meantime they have aligned themselves with the camp of people who's idea we have already seen fail.

No they are not. Only the people that already are Bitcoin rich or are making a fortune day trading. This will end one day .... unless Bitcoin becomes a global payment system. 

If onchain scaling turns out to not work, then it really means all of Bitcoin turns out not to work.

"&gt; Yes, there is. If the consensus change is backwards incompatible, it is a hard fork, no matter the details of the change. You're simply mistaken. 

Then Bitcoin Core has had numerous hardforks, as a node from 2010 will not sync to today's chain without significant changes.

&gt; No soft forks in Bitcoin have used, relied upon, or even somewhat incorporated Sybil attacks in their deployment or activation.

Suuuuuuure. Clearly the UASF didn't rely on a sybil attack, clearly not. Launching thousands of nodes that would drop non-SegWit blocks once UASF was triggered definitely wasn't a sybil attack. Multiple Class-C IP blocks being full of nodes, controlled by the same person or people, that all ran UASF nodes, those were clearly innocent and not at all the preparation for a sybil attack. Node count increasing with more and more UASF nodes? Clearly wasn't a preparation for a sybil attack.

Just because it was never taken into action, and was only a threat that made miners support SegWit for fear of the consequences in case Core went ahead with their attack, doesn't mean it wasn't used.

Trademark allows you to stop anyone from using the name for commercial purposes related to the trademark without your permission. It wouldn't matter whether someone was selling Bitcoin books, a bitcoin exchange, bitcoin tokens or bitcoin t shirts, you could sue them for using the name ""Bitcoin"" without your permission. Trademark grants a wide range of exclusive rights.

&gt;gold is not a trademark, no one owns the word 'gold', but gold has physical properties that can be demonstrated.

Thanks to bitcoins open source license you are legally entitled to completely copy the bitcoin codebase with 100% identical properties to Bitcoin. You don't even need to make slight changes to make it different. You're allowed to sell something as gold so long as it contains some amount of gold. It doesn't even have to be pure gold. A range of alloys all with fairly different properties can all be sold as ""gold"".

Trying to call it fraud would be like a phone network trying to sue another phone network for selling credit on their own network because it wasn't the biggest, most popular or original phone network, that they're the real ""phone network"", and by other networks calling themselves a ""phone network"" they are defrauding customers trying to get on the ""real"" phone network but are being tricked onto getting onto the fake phone network.

Only significant material changes to the nature of the phone network (i.e. it can only send text messages and not phone calls) might open up that phone network to charges of fraudulent selling by describing itself as a phone network.

If the technology is freely usable by anyone then so is the name, in absence of a trademark to give one group exclusive rights to the name.

Open source software by its nature requires trademarks/copyright if you are going to try to elevate one particular branch as real or authentic and others as fake.

Nano is effectively new tech for the exchanges. It cannot be run at scale on a single node. Exchanges are lazy and just use the standard user single software node for as long as they can get away with it.  /u/raix_jaydubs has had no problems scaling Nanex, because he is competent. Kucoin are copying his implementation. So should all other exchanges.

On to velocity: Adoption means things like gaining a share of the $600b annual remittance market, over coins like XRP. I see that as an easy future win _once we have more fiat on-ramps_. Since Nano  _is_ the currency, those remittance senders would _have_ to buy some to send it. The more buyers than sellers, the more the price goes up, obv.s.

"My friend, please, read again my comment, carefully. You got everything wrong ma' man!

Let me correct you about my comment:

I said ""Unless bitcoin reduces its node count to something like 10 supernodes."" because **thats the BCH plan!** When you scale a cryptocurrency using bigger blocks, you force every node to consume a huge internet bandwidth. The result of this is that only enterprises will run nodes. A bit fast forward, only global corporations like Amazon/Google/Governments will have infrastructure to instantaneously upload worldwide GB blocks. That way **you also centralize miners** because they will need to clump together for low latency and share the costs of maintaining their supernode data center. Maybe they will only have the option to trust a government/corporation node. **The problem with big blocks is not storage, its internet bandwidth**. If HDs became free and infinite as of today, it would be **still** unsustainable to scale BTC onchain.

A Lightning Hub is something **much much much** lighter for a hardware. A Binance-level LN could be operated on a regular PC. Also, its much lighter on the internet connection because you consume bandwidth only from the origin wallet to the destiny wallet's server. Your coffee transaction wont be downloaded 10000x over and over again to each worldwide node. This will also free a lot of space on the blockchain.",1524934605

"&gt;Distribution

XRPs plan works on volume from public exchanges, who would buy the new one? Also, forks basically can distribute the forked coin just like BCH did, boom, distribution solved. BCH didn't seem to have any issues with it, why would the next fork? Also, BCHs isn't exactly distributed either, the vast majority is concentrated in the hands of a few entities. Ripple is just more transparent about it.

&gt;Making forks successful.

Exactly my point for a copycat XRP. Who would buy it? Who would run nodes? Who would push incentives to build the ecosystem? Who would ensure compliance? Who would work with regulators? **What would the incentive be to use a copycat XRP product over one that's established with a trusted company overseeing the ecosystem, relatively high trading volume, exchange listings, established third party validator nodes etc?**

&gt;Uncensorable and no one will ever use it

Haha people say the exact same thing about Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, no companies or businesses will ever use it. How is Bitcoin Cash more uncensorable? Bitmain absolutely dominates the hash rate, so you'd rather trust a pseudonymous company in China, and think large businesses will as well? You think the Chinese government couldn't step in, or doesn't already have some control?

Again, it's already used by multiple remittance companies, some of the largest in the world. SBI Holdings has expressed interest in expanding their MoneyTap internationally utilizing xRapid, as well as their upcoming XRP/fiat Virtual Currency exchange. 

That's multiple large institutions, using it when it's still in beta. It's true it's a possibility they won't use it, it's far from guaranteed. However, every xCurrent customer can begin using xRapid with the push of a button, and I'm betting they will use the software once it's out of beta and regulation is not so murky. xCurrent customers include the Bank of England, American Express, SAMA, MUFG etc. I'm betting they would rather push a button to use xRapid rather than drop Ripple as a client, then redo their whole systems **again** for a different cryptocurrency. Every investment is a risk.

Also, say to switch the discussion from ""What can XRP do that BCH can't"" to ""Even so, no one will use it"".

Thing is, tech limits trickle down to, ultimately, block size limits. At this point we can disagree on where this limit should be, and I'm more than happy to discuss this separately, but it is a limit that we need to accept. Long story short, I think where this limit is will depend on what you want the final system to look like - Potentially every user to be able to run their own node, or not. My personal opinion, or better dream, is that in 10yrs a ""mobile phone wallet"" should actually run a fully validating node! Download wallet, wait, say, 30min, get node fully up to speed. This is leads to the kind of decentralization that is absolutely immortal, and that's what I want. Or anything as close to this as possible.

As I said, separate discussion...

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;As far as new nodes taking months/years to sync up: yes that sucks but here are some thoughts on that: Some nodes might not care. They simply concider the sync time as a startup ""cost"" that they have to ""pay"" (by waiting) before going live. Peronsally I wouldn't care, I have no time constraint on going live for my purposes of running a full node.

For a business, this is very quickly prohibitive. I just don't see businesses kicking this up today, waiting for 3 months, and then up and running. What I do see, instead, as very awesome is a salesman walking into your local corner shop with a ~$300 full node to sell, which syncs in ~1hr, on a Sun morning before the merchant opens late, and then is good to go. Again, this is decentralization that cannot be killed.

&gt;Doing so is a bit of a compromise, because they **have to trust** that everthing up until `CurrentBlock - 100` is valid without performing validation themselves.

Highlight mine... and here lies the problem. If we are happy to compromise on the *completely trustless* nature of Bitcoin, then yes, life becomes a lot easier. This really goes to the core (pun not intended) of the problem - There are no conspiracies, just design compromises. You can't have it all, so you need to give up something.

Yes, if we decide that a ""partial trust based"" system is OK, then you are absolutely correct, bigger blocks will absolutely do. And again there is no right or wrong answer, just different compromises and different priorities people are making. You can probably guess my viewpoint, I'm not willing to give up *complete* trusetlessness, high fees be damned. In other words, I accept high fees as the price to pay to retain full trustlessness. And this is without compromise, which should make it clearer why ""small blockers are so irrationally stubborn"".

One of the arguments is, think I've written this somewhere else around here, that if you trust everything up to, say, `CurrentBlock-N`, you are relying on peers to feed you the correct UTXO set for `CurrentBlock-N`. With this premise, I can set up many nodes, say thousands on AWS, that randomly feed 100 different UTXO sets for `CurrentBlock-N`. At that point, you will not be able to determine very much, and you'll need to keep validating every single one of my UTXO sets and I'm not sure you'd ever get out of the mess.

In other words, a trust-based system can be Sybil attacked relatively easily. Which is one of the reasons I don't want such a system.

Note: I'm not saying this type of system could never be set up, perhaps as a mix of trusted+trustless. Maybe we could rely on actors that build reputation over time to feed us more recent data. But the key requirement, to validate the full UTXO set from scratch, remains. Or you're not in a mixed set up at all, but a trusted one.

&amp;nbsp;

Hope this clears the ""hard core small block"" position better. We're really not paid shills or Blockstream brainwashed sockpuppets. Much more simply, we're not willing to compromise on a few key aspects of the beautiful system Satoshi came up with, and are absolutely fine with all the consequences of this... high fees for on chain transactions first and foremost.

Also it would be completely unfair considering the other sub has 4x the subscribers, and there was only one coin when it was created. They didn't have to worry about 2 bitcoins, so they just chose the name.

Also  [r/bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin)  is not for discussing **btc** only. 5/17 top posts there now are related to BCH. Only one is a meme/insult. Pretty much all of the posts right now are insulting bitcoin on this sub.

There are only 5 fucking mentions of Bitcoin cash on the entire website. 2 strategically positioned to just barely not be on screen on the standard monitor size. 2 at the bottom of the website. 1 in the fucking footnote link section. BCH is only mentioned 3 times, in the same place, and beside the BTC price on the header.

BITCOIN IS MENTIONED 60 FUCKING TIMES. On the actual [bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org) site it is only mentioned 10 times, AND THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE. [Bitcoin.org](https://Bitcoin.org) looks a lot more like a start up, which I mean years ago it was. A grand idea of decentralized currency.

"&gt; It's possible I might have missed it, but it would appear that Satoshi himself never mentions exchanging fiat cash for Bitcoin through exchanges.

Not sure how relevant this is, but he did say specifically that it will either be ""worth"" a lot or ""worth"" nothing.  Obviously that's not a direct quote using the word ""fiat"" or ""dollars"", but worth is expressed colloquially through a person's regional currency.

&gt; To repeat what I have said early differently, as more crypto continues to be created, we must choose where to invest our scarce fiat cash.

Sure.

&gt; Thus, even while all crypto are similar, but not identical, the expanding totality of the their supplies will continue to erode Bitcoin's price.

First of all, that's not necessarily true.  No one is required to invest in a given coin, so the introduction of a new coin does not guarantee an erosion of bitcoin's price.

Second, even if what you have stated were true, if the entire ecosystem experiences a rise in value, said erosion won't be noticed.

But the issue I have is that, very clearly, supply requires fungibility.  If Bitcoin has a specific price, introducing another coin (assuming 0 buys of said coin) has zero effect on Bitcoin's price.  However, introducing more Bitcoin *would* have an effect on Bitcoin's price.  This is different.

You're making the assumption that new coins will have value AND this value is the same value bitcoin provides (since the new coin, by your logic, must necessarily eat at the value of bitcoin).  Both of those assumptions are incorrect.  New coins may not have value, and thus will not dilute Bitcoin's price.  New coins may also operate in a manner that Bitcoin currently cannot, which means Bitcoin wouldn't be purchased anyways for such a use case.

"**Rwandan genocide**

The Rwandan genocide, also known as the genocide against the Tutsi, was a genocidal mass slaughter of Tutsi in Rwanda by members of the Hutu majority government. An estimated 500,000 to 1,000,000 Rwandans were killed during the 100-day period from 7 April to mid-July 1994, constituting as many as 70% of the Tutsi population. Additionally, 30% of the Pygmy Batwa were killed. The genocide and widespread slaughter of Rwandans ended when the Tutsi-backed and heavily armed Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) led by Paul Kagame took control of the country.

"There was a chain split and community split in August. This is due 100% to the intransigence of the Core developers and their supporters. We tried everything possible to compromise to prevent a chain split and keep the community together. In the end their version of a compromise was ""you give us everything we want, and we'll give you nothing you want"". 

So there was no choice but to take the nuclear option and split the chain and community. There isn't just a single bitcoin now because of this. There are two (technically more than two but only two that matter). 

The Core side wants to whitewash this history and pretend like none of this happened. They want people to think that there wasn't a chain/community split and there aren't two versions of Bitcoin as a result. They want people to think Bitcoin Cash is just some random unrelated altcoin that is trying to leach off the Bitcoin brand.

1. i don't understand why a fixed supply curve is the only thing that is good about crypto (what about decentralization, consensus, tranfer times and fees, etc..? those exist also without a fixed supply). There is a vice article saying ""Cryptocurrencies Are in Fixed Supply and That's a Problem"". I don't say they are right, but i think you aren't either.
2. why is creating a new coin an antithesis for fixed supply? If every single coin has fixed supply, then all of them together also have fixed supply. F.e. lets say i make a new coin with fixed supply and the best tech of all cryptos, eventually becoming the world currency. Then we have fixed supply like with bitcoin, but everyone has a better experience, humanity saves a lot of resource, has more possibilities etc. Image everyone using netscape 1.0 still. What's wrong about that?

Also, some techs are better suited for certain use cases, so it makes very much sense to have different coins (for some of them it might even make sense not to have limited supply, depending on the use case). Google ""Web 3.0: the internet of bockchains"" and you will see what i mean.

"&gt; For EOS, a dedicated subset of 21 nodes aka block producers is elected by the network to propose the blocks.

Anyone can run a validating node (just not on a RaspberryPi). This is not permissioned. A node does not need to be elected in order to validate transactions, only to produce blocks/be on standby in case an active block producer is voted out or goes offline. This requires being voted in with stake. So to get the lucrative job of being a block producer, requires stake. Mining hardware is also expensive, but you have to buy it. A block producer on EOS could conceivably get elected while owning next to no stake themselves - on their other merits.

&gt; 21 active, 121 nodes online. What's the difference? Ethereum has over 10,000 nodes in the network. Less nodes mean less decentralization, less security and less like blockchain. 

Decentralization and node count make a curve. Performance and node count make another curve. To create a blockchain system that is actually useful to humanity, both curves must be taken into account.

&gt; Well the government can't shut EOS down but basically now you're trusting all your money to anonymous whales running the nodes compared to your Government.

I'm not following your reasoning here. Just because they run the network, doesn't mean you have to share your private keys with them. This is like saying with Bitcoin you are trusting a bunch of miners with your money.

"It's possible I might have missed it, but it would appear that Satoshi himself never mentions exchanging fiat cash for Bitcoin through exchanges. It would also explain why Satoshi's addresses have never moved, as using fiat to value and purchase Bitcoin defeats its intended purpose. 

People here seem to think that everyone has an infinite amount of hard earned fiat cash to use to buy crypto with when that is clearly not the case. We have already seen the influx of altcoins (aka shitcoins) erode Bitcoin's price. If no altcoins existed, of course everyone's fiat cash would be directed into Bitcoin and its fiat price would most likely be substantially higher. To repeat what I have said early differently, as more crypto continues to be created, we must choose where to invest our *scarce* fiat cash. Thus, even while all crypto are similar, but not identical, the expanding totality of the their supplies will continue to erode Bitcoin's price.",1524931145

You can only go so far with a single project at a time, evidently - if you're the face/spokesperson of a multi billion crypto which promised to do everything, as Vitalik is, he's locked into defending that irrespective of the reality of the situation.

People tried to play the same card on Dan Larimer for not 'sticking with' his other blockchains (which were 100% working and completed, and he then left in the capable hands of other developers) but it doesn't fly because they are specific applications for specific purposes (which doesn't make them immune from attracting 'believers').

"What stops anyone from copying Bitcoin Cash for a cheaper coin without polarizing figureheads? I'm sure people would love to support a Bitcoin that follows the white paper and doesn't have the controversial backers that Bitcoin Cash does such as Roger, CSW and Jihan.

If people copied Ripples software that utilizes XRP and made another token, it wouldn't be interoperable with their software that uses XRP and no one would even use it. It could be traded on the XRP Ledger, but not used in xRapid or xVia.

Why would any one trust some brand new chain that the only people running validators and publishing a UNL list for are some unknown people? Right now multiple banks and institutions are already running validator nodes, what would be the incentive to switch and trust some new guy? It would take a huge amount of resources, effort and time it would take to catch up to Ripple/XRP's progress, who would do that rather than just use XRP?

Ripple and XRP have been around since 2012, the XRP ecosystem is overseen by a company that has over 200 employees, has a dedicated staff to help institutions with integration, has many ex regulators and prominent compliance officers in order to make sure they stay legal (can even operate in NY). It already has companies that move billions per year trusting XRP, Western Union and MoneyGram being the most notable. It already usually has more transactions per day than Bitcoin and Ethereum and over 150 validator nodes, and xRapid is still only in beta.

There are plenty of coins that are just as fast, but XRPs fees are variable. If paying 10 XRP per 1 million transactions is truly too much for institutions and XRPs price rises enough to make that unreasonable, the validators will just vote to lower the fees and wallet reserve requirement.It

&gt;If it can't be used in Silk Road then it's not really money.

So your only point in favor of Bitcoin Cash is DNMs use it? Most actually don't seem to accept it from what I can tell looking online, but I could be wrong. 

""In a bizarre yet significant move, Dream has yet again made headlines with an integration of Bitcoin Cash...observers can only speculate about why the popular darknet market chose to go for Bitcoin Cash considering its deficiency, particular anonymity and privacy""

From just a few weeks ago in an article about Dream integrating BCH:

 ""The reason it evokes interest now it it is the very first attempt by a dark net market to BCH in its basket of officially accepted currencies for transactions""

So apparently you can't use it on most DNMs anyways, so by your definition it isn't really money.

I would never use anything other than Monero for any private transactions I may need to make, so I don't see how this is a huge plus when there are popular coins designed specifically for stuff like this. It would matter if they **only** accepted Bitcoin Cash, but that's not true of the single DNM that does.",1524931027

"This is a solid counterpoint. I probably was overstating it when I said that Satoshi *definitely* would disagree. However, I still think I'm right.

However, this just kicks the can down the road, because the term 'honest' is not well-defined in bitcoin, either. It's a social agreement. Some on this sub have argued that SegWit is 'dishonest', and that makes the BTC chain invalid. I'd disagree, but they're free to argue that.

I'm not sure *anyone* would say that a dishonest block at the head of the chain **is** now part of 'bitcoin' (for those 10 minutes or so, until it's overtaken by the 'honest' miners).

"Hello brawdias,

Transaction fees are measured in satoshis, which is a denomination of bitcoin. So if you mean that the transaction fees expressed in fiat are higher when the value of bitcoin is higher you are right. When expressed in btc, however, the transaction fees depend on other factors. 

Factors that influence the transaction fees on the bitcoin network are the demand and supply of transactions. A block can have a max amount of transactions it can validate within a certain time period.  Miners prefer transactions with higher fees because it makes it more profitable to mine, so if you want your transaction to be validated immediately you should send a higher fee. You can check out the following website [here](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) to get an accurate estimate of which fee you should send with your transaction.

"Greedy and selfish is called human nature.

I've been buying bitcoin every week since 2012.  Dollar cost averaging.  I try to keep bitcoin at 6% of my net worth and generally don't sell unless it exceeds 12% during my quarterly rebalancing targets.  I've sold bitcoin 3 times in 5.5 years -- at $900, $3300 and in the $18,000 range.  

So every week I buy a small amount, typically around $125 average.  I retired 3 years ago at age 41 and have been buying $125 a week as usual, but as of last quarter (ending March 31, 2018) I realized my passive income is about double what I expected, so I am doubling my bitcoin purchases to $250 a week, every week.

I am not living off of bitcoin profits, I just want to acquire more.

And yes, I do think a long-term investment is the best strategy in the current market.  VeChain(VEN) and OmiseGO(OMG) are the two best long-term investments IMO.  One key thing I didn't mention about both is that you will receive rewards for owning the coins - for VEN companies will pay when they use the tracking, and OMG companies will pay for each transaction/exchange.  By holding the coins, you receive a percentage of each transaction - so the more the network is utilized, the more rewards you receive, and the more the value of the coin rises - especially enticing when offers a lot of potential/value for companies without the public ever having to be aware of it.  Rewards(aka Staking) hasn't launched for either yet, but will be live in June for VeChain and August for OmiseGo.
    
I'd recommend doing some research into the partners both have.  VeChain has an incredible list already, including direct deals with the Chinese Government(Google VeChain/Gu'ian) and OmiseGO has made a deal with Thailands government at a large scale.  IMO, these coins have a very high chance of succeeding in the long term with high returns as well as passive income - they are my main long-term holds, along with ICON(ICX).
    
As far as when to buy in and how much to allocate, that's up to you.  If you're unsure, I would buy some now, and then save some funds for later in the event we see a downturn/buying opportunity.  This my own opinion, but I do think we're due for another strong rise towards the latter part of this year.  If you look at the early signs, such as the SEC/FTC's positive views on regulation, Goldman Sachs spending $400 million on a crypto exchange in an unregulated market, Japanese banks offering crypto directly and governments making deals with cryptos, I think the predictive signs are there.  I don't forsee crypto replacing currency, at least in the near term - I'd give it 3-10 years before that is really on the table, and IMO this is all the ""public"" really thinks of is ""why would we need to replace the dollar or use another currency""?    
        
I do see an impending explosion of blockchain companies entering the space and disrupting/creating massive value(VeChain/OmiseGo, Brave Browser, many others) paired with ease of use increasing, public awareness shifting from seeing crypto as currency to the power/value some companies will provide, and institutional money entering the space(Bitcoin ETFs).  These specific cryptos may fluctuate with the market, but long-term they have massive potential for success.

For example, if you wish you can fork the software and change the delegate count to a more decentralized number such as 50 or 100, but the trade off is that you will lose performance in the process. So the question is not ""are you decentralized"", it is ""are you decentralized enough to be safe from corruption"". That latter question depends on more than your consensus protocol. It depends on a multitude of things. Right now, Ethereum and Bitcoin are NOT decentralized, period. They have more centralization because people like Jihan Wu own most of the hash rate and therefore make most of the decisions for the community. So the fact that Bitcoin is still considered decentralized is pathetic. In Ethereum's case, it suffers from the same fate at the moment. Even when it moves to proof of stake, it will suffer from centralization due to the stake consensus. There are few people who own the majority of Eth if I am not mistaken, and if not, then this can easily be accomplished with time. So Eth and Eos suffer the same fate in terms of whales controling the staking power, but Eos at-least allows faster throughput. Think of EOS as a more decentralized version of AWS and Paypal put together. DPOS requires many of the whales to be against one another and to not work together for it to work effectively for decentralized purposes. It's not ideal decentralization, but what is?",1524930143

Banks could start their own crypto and go that route, full embrace, but is it profitable for them? Surely they make a fuck ton more money now by keeping all these fees right?

There are so many profoundly different ways in which crypto can cut costs, save the majority of us money, render huge industries redundant or seriously change them...

Math or bullshit. There are no other options.

Let's math.

A single transaction is at least 250 bytes. They're typically 0.5kb.

A transaction to pay for a single kilobyte of data (whether a newly crafted Bitcoin transaction or a newly recrafted Lightning channel transaction) requires the assembly of about 0.5kb of data.

That means to pay for data received you are generating and transmitting 50% of that amount of data.

Absurd. Nobody would do that and nobody would provide that service.

Math didn't check out. It's bullshit.

"&gt;Your definition of ""remarkably mistaken"" is to speak solely about transactions, rather than saying ""transactions/blocks/protocols"", when talking about transactions and their relations to forks, in the context of transactions. Nice.

My definition of ""remarkably mistaken"" is standard; when something is phrased strongly, specifically, and falsely, it is mistaken. Your definitions of various types of forks are *not* the actual established definitions, and lead directly to erroneous conclusions, because you're confused on terminology and spreading your confusion as much as you can.

&gt;A simultaneous tightening and broadening of the rules by, for example, enabling new previously-invalid transaction types and disabling previously-valid transaction types, has properties of both a soft fork and a hard fork. It is simultaneously a soft fork and a hard fork, as it's the same as having a hard fork immediately followed by a soft fork.

No, it is simply a hard fork. This is why definitions matter, and your incorrect conclusion here is a result of you not knowing the actual definitions of these terms.

If a new consensus protocol is backwards-compatible with the old one, it is a soft fork. If it is not, it is a hard fork. When you get the definitions wrong, you wind up making stupid mistakes like this one, where you think ""It's *both* a hard fork and a soft fork!"" despite this being a definitional impossibility due to the mutual exclusivity of the two terms.

&gt;There is nothing in the definitions directly stating that if both occur it is to be called solely a hard fork

Yes, there is. If the consensus change is backwards incompatible, it is a hard fork, *no matter the details of the change*. You're simply mistaken. 

&gt;if you buy a new house and sell your old one you'll generally say you've bought a house, rather than saying you've sold a house, despite both occurring.

You can buy a house without selling another, and you can sell a house without buying another. If you've bought a new house, you can definitely say that you have done so, just like you can also say ""I sold my old house and bought a new one."" These are all valid statements. However, they are not relevant to your terminological misunderstanding regarding blockchain consensus forks.

&gt;Nice strawman you got there. What I said is that the UASF, which would have nodes attacking the network to stop the propagation of non-SegWit blocks, was being widely supported by the Bitcoin Core community when they didn't have sufficient miner support for SegWit.

No, you didn't. Go re-read your above comment and look at what you *actually* said regarding ""Sybil attacks""... it isn't what you seem to be pretending it was.

No soft forks in Bitcoin have used, relied upon, or even somewhat incorporated Sybil attacks in their deployment or activation. You simply don't understand the subjects you're trying to discuss, and seem unwilling to learn or grow. Oh well.",1524928185

Thankful for what they did, but I don't really worry to much about what their views are in the same way I am not concerned with the political leanings of the guy who created email.

It makes a nice story, but society already has enough arguments brought down about what some dead/gone person would have to say about the current state of something (politics, religion, constitutions).  
  
I think the farther bitcoin moves away from Satoshi the more healthy it will be. We are less than 10 years in and only 7 years removed from Satoshi's last appearance yet we still ended up with a mini-civil war where ""Satoshi's Vision"" was a main talking point of one side. It dragged on for 2 years before a fork and now has entered a second phase of tribalism. I cannot imagine how heated this kind of thing would become given an entire generation polarization.  
  
Satoshi being anonymous was very important as it created no owner/god/king/CEO for bitcoin.

Same thing applies to the other end of the channel who you are connected with.  Both parties can close the channel at any time for any reason.  I would suggesting having at least three channels open spreading out your Lightning balance.  If you put all your balance on a single channel, who you're connected with can effectively send all of your funds out of the Lightning network if they decide to close the channel.  Then you lose your ability to spend in the Lightning network.  If you disperse it across a few channels, you should always have some to spend and have time to repair a closed channel.",1524927801

"Um... Genuine question, how is it name calling? BTC stands for BiTCoin. BCH stands for Bitcoin CasH. BCasH is a shorter way of saying Bitcoin Cash without shortening all the way to BCH, and is shorter in spoken word than either of the other options (2 syllables rather than 3). It's not name calling, it's a way to differentiate it from BTC while also keeping the name short... If you say ""Bitcoin,"" people are gonna think of Bitcoin, not Bitcoin Cash, because that's what had the name first, and is the most popular thing with that name.

If you want to be called Bitcoin too, like I'm seeing with all the references to how lots of countries have their own ""dollar,"" that's fine and all, but doesn't that come with the same problems all those countries have when referring to their dollars in an international scale, which is that the average person thinks of the USD when referring to dollars? Yes those other currencies are also called dollars, but unless you specify for example Hong Kong Dollars, people will assume you mean USD.

This strategy works to guard against loss when a market can turn bear but it also has its downsides.

- I sold half my BTC when it hit $2900.  
- I sold half my BTC when it hit $4400.
- I sold half by BTC when it hit around $17,000

I managed to pay off most of my mortgage in its 1st year in 2017 alone (With ETH, XMR, NEO and Nano as some of my other holdings)  but if I hadn't sold for profits the 1st and 2nd time, I'd have been able to pay off the whole amount plus had a pretty sizable downpayment for a rental property.  Taking profits did protect me from losing money if there was a major crash at $2900 or $4400.  

What I am trying to say is taking profit early and often is a defensive play that will ensure you make money but it can also really hurt your long term chances of really big gains if the market or your coin continues to moon.  ",1524927589

I support free speech, and do not think they should have to give up the domain, but those of us that oppose that can spread the word that bitcoin.com is an anti-bitcoin site that is deliberately confusing people. Free speech is annoying at times, but it has an influence on people's opinions.

If BCH supporters would at least agree that it's sleezy, I might be convinced to not associate BCH itself with sleezy actions by Roger Ver, and stop thinking BCH=scam. But I've never seen a BCH supporter agree they should stop trying to take the Bitcoin name, or acknowledge that their fork didn't gain enough popularity to be the ""main"" one, so their coup failed.

"**Streisand effect**

The Streisand effect is the phenomenon whereby an attempt to hide, remove, or censor a piece of information has the unintended consequence of publicizing the information more widely, usually facilitated by the Internet. It is an example of psychological reactance, wherein once people are aware that some information is being kept from them, their motivation to access and spread it is increased.It is named after American entertainer Barbra Streisand, whose 2003 attempt to suppress photographs of her residence in Malibu, California, inadvertently drew further public attention to it. Similar attempts have been made, for example, in cease-and-desist letters to suppress files, websites, and even numbers. Instead of being suppressed, the information receives extensive publicity and media extensions such as videos and spoof songs, often being widely mirrored on the Internet or distributed on file-sharing networks.

"Erik,

I don't think at all that you are an enemy of bitcoin. In fact, I think you are a great supporter of it. But it's difficult to really understand what bitcoin really is. 

Think about it this way. Let's say that in the future about 51% of miners decide that they don't like the fact that the block reward will be decreasing and they want to keep it at 12.5 btc. So, they get together and agree they will maintain the block reward at 12.5 btc no matter what. So there is a chain split---in the immediate period their chain will have 51% hash power (thus greater total POW) and the other 49%. 

Now you are saying that the market will decided because based on which chain users prefer the price of one chain will drop and the price of the other will rise and therefore miners in the 51% group will switch to the 'true' chain. But let's say that they don't because of ideological reasons--we saw how during the BCH fork initially there were miners mining it at a loss just for ideological reasons so this can happen.

Which is the real bitcoin now? By your definition it is the one with the highest 'work'--the 51% chain with the perpetual 12.5 btc reward. But that's not right. Why? Because the miners changed the consensus rules of bitcoin unilaterally and even though they have the highest POW chain they have created an 'invalid' chain. I think Satoshi himself pointed out such a scenario.

I think Roger is confused. He created a new coin FROM BITCOIN--but it is NOT bitcoin. I think he would do himself a great favor by just realizing this and working to make his new coin 'better' than bitcoin instead of wasting a lot of energy trying to confuse people by claiming it is the 'real' bitcoin. IT IS NOT.",1524926794

Fees *aren't* $50. Also, why?

&gt;On-chain scaling does work, up to a certain point, and we don‚Äôt know yet at what point it stops working.

Agreed. Bitcoin will get a blocksize increase at some point but it certainly doesn't need it now and the right move is to exhaust efficiency upgrades (Segwit, Schnorr, etc.) before raising the blocksize, which necessarily reduces the decentralization. BCash's roadmap (increase blocksize indiscriminately) is a recipe for disaster because it doesn't protect against spam and creates a perpetual problem of decreasing fees, which leads to more spam, which leads to increased fees, which leads to larger blocks... and so on... and so on. It's a horrible idea. Not to mention that, even without accounting for spam economics, a globally adopted BCH would have blocks in the range of terabytes, which is beyond untenable. It's also just a terrible design decision, beyond it's effects on centralization.

"&gt; making a concerted effort to convince ppl that BCH is Bitcoin that‚Äôs very misleading

What's misleading is passing BTC off as [Bitcoin](http://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf) when it deviates in a material way with almost every section of that white paper, including the title

We understand you guys don't think Bitcoin as described in the paper will work.  That's OK.  If you don't agree with a coin's design, the correct approach is to *mine an altcoin* not [hijack the project](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/informative_btc_vs_bch_articles/dl8v4lp/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage).

But you guys *did* end up hijacking the project, starting by throwing out the top devs, then the attack on the rbitcoin community, then the endless failed compromises (8-4-2, the failed HK agreement, the NYA bait-and-switch, need-I-continue). 

In doing so you (maybe not you personally, but the people whose side you are taking) split the community irreparably.  rbtc literally would not exist except for theymos throwing out thousands and thousands of bigblockers.  BCH would not exist except for the years of persistent attacks and failed compromises.

&gt; While it can‚Äôt be owned the devs should have control over the ticker since that‚Äôs the globally recognized name/face of bitcoin

And who, pray, are ""the devs?""

I'd point out that of the four major compatible BTC full-client implementations (Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin Classic) only one of these opposed larger blocks.

If your answer is that Bitcoin Core is the only devs that can define Bitcoin, then you do not have a permissionless coin.  You have an organization called Bitcoin Core with a single individual at the top ultimately responsible for what is and is not ""Bitcoin.""",1524925969

"**Application-specific integrated circuit**

An Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) , is an integrated circuit (IC) customized for a particular use, rather than intended for general-purpose use. For example, a chip designed to run in a digital voice recorder or a high-efficiency Bitcoin miner is an ASIC. Application-specific standard products (ASSPs) are intermediate between ASICs and industry standard integrated circuits like the 7400 series or the 4000 series.

As feature sizes have shrunk and design tools improved over the years, the maximum complexity (and hence functionality) possible in an ASIC has grown from 5,000 logic gates to over 100 million. Modern ASICs often include entire microprocessors, memory blocks including ROM, RAM, EEPROM, flash memory and other large building blocks.

You're just gonna concern troll able bit, won't you?

Not true. Txs are NOT valid without signature. If you think they are, try sending one and let is know how it goes. It's old nodes that won't see the signature because it's been moved to a different part of the block, but the new nodes **will** see it and **will** validate it.

&gt;You rely on the miners good behaviour to actually check the signatures, when it's cheaper for them not to.

This is broken understanding. No one designs security software like that, certainly not core. SegWit works because it doesn't rely on miners good will, much like Bitcoin.

Please stop the concern trolling.",1524925472
"u/Napo555 The first step here is recognizing that all cryptos are not targeting replacing currency.  Instead of Cryptocurrency, it's better to think of them as Cryptoassets.    
    
I'll give you two examples - the first is VeChain.  This company creates tracking devices - QR codes, RFID/NFC chips, etc.  Each one has a unique signature that is stored on the blockchain, so it can't be altered.  For example, let's say a company is transporting sushi, which must be kept cold.  A VeChain tracking chip is in the truck and monitoring the temperature to ensure it is always at safe levels - if it ever goes unsafe, it will be recorded and that data cannot be altered/deleted because of how the blockchain works.  This data is visible to every company along the supply chain and the consumer.  The end result is shipping/tracking will be much safer and transparent and fights counterfeiting, a huge problem in China, without any ""currency"" ever being adopted.  This can be applied to almost anything - Wine, shoes, luxury handbags, cars(They're working with BMW and Renault), Employee ID badges, any IoT device.  This project can massively succeed, even if the world goes on using fiat currency for the next 300 years.    
    
Another example is OmiseGO - They're a large payment gateway company in Southeast Asia, working on tech that can potentially do 1 million TPS(Plasma).  Here's the issue they're solving - Money cannot be sent between different services at the moment - Paypal can't be sent to Venmo, Paypal can't be sent to Western Union, etc.  In other countries, E-wallets are very popular, but there are many companies and most are not compatible with each other and it's a huge issue.  They already have massive partnerships(PWC, DNV GL, Kuehne + Nagel) and notable investors(Billionaire tech investors Jim Breyer and Tim Draper).    
    
What OmiseGO will be doing is creating a fast platform that you can seamlessly transfer normal fiat money between anywhere, recorded on the blockchain.  Companies can adopt the tech, again in the background, and allow payments to go to any other company using the tech.  This can include you having USD loaded in your wallet, and paying in EURO without ever having to exchange the currency and pay high fees.  You send them USD, it's instantly converted into Euros at the lowest rate, and the vendor receives Euros - all seamlessly and recorded on the blockchain.  Same applies for redeeming reward programs and other transactions - all at a speed far faster than Visa and others are currently using.     
    
Hopefully this helps explain why crypto can succeed without replacing fiat.  To answer your other question, yes BTC and ETH can be replaced, but they will have a strong ""moat"" from years of developed technology and partnerships with existing companies.   Cryptos can be upgraded as time progresses as well, with developers always working actively to improve them.    
    
Hope this helps :)",1524925406

"&gt; We can both accept that what he did here is good, and that what he did before with S2X was really, really bad.

I wonder. He is calling out Ver for failing to to topple Bitcoin with a looney fork he co-opted once S2X failed. He is not calling Ver out over the technical inanity that is the BCH roadmap, inanity that S2X was no stranger to.

Let us not be mistaken, BCH is garbage on its own lack of technical merit, regardless of how obnoxious Ver is. This fork isn't even at the point where implementation snafus would matter, because it would crash and burn on a perfect implementation anyways, seeing how terrible the ideas being implemented are to begin with.

Voorhees is critical of the tip of the iceberg. It's hypocritical, as he attacks the politics, yet conveniently ignores the inane technicals, even more so in a space where code trumps politics at every turn. I would even say he goes as far as saying BCH is sound, as he implies it would be Bitcoin if it had the most accumulated work.

2) Segwit was a soft fork. Nobody is forced to use it. Miners can continue mining legacy blocks just like before the fork. When they do so, they can use the full range of ASICboost techniques, just like BCash miners can.

I had never encountered this scam before and it downloaded a Trojan to my laptop to the point I had to wipe it. I would laugh at such an attempt now, but back then I was naive. I wasn't purposefully stupid just uninformed because no one told me about this kind of scam. 

If I had stored by life savings on a cryptocurrency wallet and thought that it was safe to store my key on my computer (that is now wiped by a virus), I am suddenly penniless. I might become homeless or desperate and start mugging people in order to not be evicted. So now because there was no method of me getting that money back that was stolen by the simple virtue of me misunderstanding Bitcoin security I am now a criminal and a liability to society. 

Let's now say that Bitcoin is the only currency in the US. How many people do you think would have similar stories: small mistake or large ignorance caused them to lose every penny they had? How badly do you think that would affect society when scammers are free and clear to fleece as many people as they want and no central authority to stop them? Sure everyone else would start a campaign of information to tell people how to secure their wallets, but it wouldn't completely prevent the crime.

"An item made with gold can vary in purity, aesthetics, form and in other ways, but the gold itself can not. Melt it down and it is indistinguishable from other amounts of gold.

X BTC originates from specific addresses that is public on the blockchain along with its entire history. Any merchant or individual can create blacklists denying transactions from certain addresses. Miners can also create blacklists and refuse to include transaction from certain addresses into their blocks. If, for example, a specific address is associated with criminal behaviour, all Bitcoin sent from this address can be considered tainted and will be less valuable than other Bitcoin. This makes Bitcoin (on the base layer at least) not fungible, unlike gold, cash and Monero.

This has not been much of an issue so far, but analysing and snooping on the blockchain and tying individuals to addresses is being done on a large scale by businesses and by intelligence organisations. This is also why decentralisation of mining pools is very important for Bitcoin. Its not due to 51% attacks, but rather the possibility of political and financial pressure on pools to enact blacklists and whitelists.",1524924126
"Nope. Because of increased block capacity fees will remain this low even after BCH has 8 times as many users as BTC, and then 32 times as many users after the May fork, then 64 times as many users in November fork (or whatever we raised it to them), etc.

We would rather have a lot of people paying a small fee and tons of transactions than a small number of people paying a large fee as on BTC. Ultimately the former will be more remunerative for miners, and was the original Satoshi vision for scaling bitcoin.

BCH devs are committed to low fees going forward, so we should expect to see penny fees for the foreseeable future, to get into the next block.

The entire third world who are more money sensitive will likely be willing to wait slightly longer to obtain free transactions, which will get them into the second or third block.

Try that on BTC and you might wait a week or literally forever for your transaction to clear.

An Example: Bob sends 1 BTC to Alice, Alice receives the transaction, waits a couple of seconds to ensure Bob didn't broadcasted a second transaction before it and she can with a good amount of certanty attest that if Bob tries to double\-spend the transaction the second transaction will arive latter to the miners, thus ensuring the transaction to her gets put into the block and the other gets ignored, because blocks that introduce this second transaction would not be mined on by miners who got the other transaction first, and a couple of seconds is enough to ensure a transaction has traveled around the world and reached every miner. When RBF got introduced Bob could send the transaction to Alice and a couple of minutes later send a different transaction with a higher fee to his own address and that would get priority, so Alice needs to wait until her transaction appears on a block before she can accept she actually received the coin.",1524923756

The BTC people are trying to achieve by their propaganda campaign what their technology is incapable of delivering.

That is why they attack us and no one else. They whip up their partisans into a frenzy over small things because they fear what our tech can do, even if they won't admit it even to themselves.

Remember that BCH proposes the flippening, which means BCH would replace BTC as the top relevant coin in the crypto space, and nearly pulled it off when B2X was cancelled and there was a mad rush out of BTC and into BCH. 

They have turned crypto into a political sphere because they wanted control and profit. They were willing to cripple bitcoin to obtain both. And they did so.

Except we escaped them and their influence, and that makes us the thorn in their side that they can never get rid of. 

Had crypto been any other commercial software project, they would own the code and could change it anyway they want and the world would be locked out.

But since they can't do that, they are trying to find other ways. First by silencing all opposition and censoring all opposing viewpoints.

Secondly, by demonizing anyone who challenges then publicly.

It's bad behavior. I'm not surprised many here are angry about it. After all, many here have been banned from forums they control, typically for lousy and unfair reasons.

Note how the other forum bans everyone for just talking about other cryptocurrencies, UNLESS you are trash talking other crypto, especially BCH, then you're golden, you get to the front page, etc.

Now that the miner already has all headers of the longest PoW chain receives a transaction from Addr1, this transaction also references the previous transaction, he can then query the branch on the block from that transaction, to validate that that address had enough back then, and validate this transaction. Now doing just this is subject to double\-spending, so he would need to downlad all blocks from that transaction until now, the older that transaction the harder it is for him to validate.

Now if you just setup a mining rig you could begin downloading the blockchain in reverse order, i.e. newer block first, and validate any transaction that has an origin transaction that's newer than the older block you've received, so theoretically you could mine an entire block before downloading the entire chain if you get enough transactions that originated from a transaction newer than your current step in the blockchain. I haven't ran analysis on any block to know about the actual statistics on how viable this would be, but it's intuitive that people who use bitcoin tend to use it more than those who just hold, so most transactions probably originate from an address that has recently received cois, especially with multi\-sig wallets where the return address is not the same as the origin.",1524922134

"I definitely see bitcoin losing its spot that is for sure.
It's not all about speed, yes it's a good thing to have but it isn't the be all and end all.
I can't say what is definitely better but to pick out two which are really already out there and working Ethereum for one which obviously due to its #2 spot is doing very well and in good use and also Ripple which is working to solve the issues behind legacy banking systems.
I'm not sure if they could definitely overtake Bitcoin but they are great examples of cryptos which are out there working in the wild solving actual issues.

Great tech and speed doesn't always mean that you will come out on top, that's obvious as people are constantly highlighting issues with Ethereum",1524921335
"The thing about Request Network is that it's a good thing for crypto as a whole. The main problem to get huge adoption, is the process of getting/using crypto. Today, you gotta go through an exchange like Coinbase to buy bitcoin, transfer that to an exchange if you want to buy other altcoins, Buy altcoins, transfer to wallet... etc etc....

What Request wants, is for you to be able to use any fiat or any crypto, buy whatever you want, and the person on the other side can chose what fiat/crypto he/she wants to receive. This is a simple explanation and it's so much more they want to do. Have a look at their [mindmap](https://www.mindmeister.com/991002501?t=R1iofDilV0) for all potential use cases.

But no one needs to interact with their token in **any** way at all to use the network! anyone today can just install the the woocommerce plugin for free, and use it to accept ethereum.

- use less words/options on your main page and less techie terminology  - it's really off putting and confusing to new users - direct them with the bare minimum they need to see/read to perform a function - simple clean interfaces with less used options put  into a simple drop down menu

- being without issues that leave people scratching their head as to why things aren't working - if you have to use tips when people do things wrong then it's the design of your website that's the problem.

- Failed transactions are not acceptable 

- MEW creates a new wallet if you mistakenly put a wrong letter/number in when you send funds - this is bad but not being able to get those funds back is unacceptable when the wallet belongs to nobody

"**Hear, hear**

Hear, hear is an expression used as a short, repeated form of hear him. It represents a listener's agreement with the point being made by a speaker.

It was originally an imperative for directing attention to speakers, and has since been used, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, as ""the regular form of cheering in the House of Commons"", with many purposes, depending on the intonation of its user. Its use in Parliament is linked to the fact that applause is normally (though not always) forbidden in the chambers of the House of Commons and House of Lords.

"This is a fallacy and rests on a false assumption that **total amount** electricity burnt must always correlate with the price of bitcoin. In reality the **cost of electricity burnt** will tend to correlate with the price of bitcoin. 

This means that as bitcoin continues to compete with all other forms  of electrical demand worldwide the price per kW across the board will  rise and thus decreasing the amount of electricity needed for bitcoin  even if the price of bitcoin continues to rise and making bitcoin more  and more efficient. This also has the side effect of encouraging more  and more efficient and greener forms of cooling and electrical  production.

BCH is bitcoin, BTC is bitcoin, the outcome will be that ONE shrinks to minimal value or zero and the other will inherit the entire value of both. This will take time.

Lovely community. Great people. Great coin. Very easy to defend without insulting competition or critics. So many wonderful comments explaining the hypocrisy that I perceived. I have truly seen the error in my ways.

"&gt; Yes, because what you mentioned has anything to do with what UASF actually does. Mind you, I'm talking about UASF, NOT real segwit, for which you should show some respect to the people who actually made it happen instead of trying to steal credit for it.

Top respect goes to the developers who coded segwit. Secondary respect to the community who made UASF happen.

&gt; No one was against segwit except for the same old big block shills which no one cared about. Miners had publicly agreed years ago in Hong Kong to activate segwit exactly until the month in which they did activate it.

Stop trying to rewrite history. Antpool was blocking segwit, [they said so themselves.](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/antpool-will-not-run-segwit-without-block-size-increase-hard-fork-1464028753/)

""When asked specifically whether Antpool would run SegWit code without a hard fork increase in the block size also included in a release of Bitcoin Core, Wu responded: ‚ÄúNo. It is acceptable that the hard fork code is not activated, but it needs to be included in a ‚Äòrelease‚Äô of Bitcoin Core. I have made it clear about the definition of ‚Äòrelease,‚Äô which is not ‚Äòpublic.‚Äô‚Äù""

i.e. They will block segwit until a hard fork version of Bitcoin Core is released. (That's what they said until the UASF movement sent them packing)

&gt; rage rage rage altcoin rage hypocrite rage central planning

There's no need to be upset... just get with the program already. Bitcoin is awesome and doesn't bow even to warehouses full of ASICs.

"It would be even harder to prove this nebulous definition of ""fraud"" in court than getting a trademark.

People are acting like there's some kind of parallel legal system that allows all the benefits of trademark protection without actually having to register a trademark because they don't want to face the reality that Bitcoin doesn't have a trademark and open source software projects get trademarks for a reason because its almost impossible to police the use of a brand name without owning the trademark.

Even with a trademark, brand names can rapidly get genericized by unlicensed competition (see: videotape, aspirin, flip phone), even when they have the legal power to stop anyone using that name.

The Linux Foundation would have had no need for the Linux trademark if it was as simple as suing anyone who wasn't the ""real"" linux.

Courts will make no distinction of what version of linux is the ""real"" linux. you can't sue someone for fraud just because they sell a version of linux that you don't deem the ""real"" linux.

If software is open source, and its distribution is not controlled by a copyright licensing agreement, then you cannot simultaneously give people free use to copy and modify software and then sue them for using the name of that software to describe that software, unless you register a trademark that says you get to decide who uses the name.

Yes, because what you mentioned has anything to do with what UASF actually does. Mind you, I'm talking about UASF, NOT real segwit, for which you should show some respect to the people who actually made it happen instead of trying to steal credit for it.

&gt; they stirred up useful idiots in the community to block the segwit upgrade for 9 months.

No one was against segwit except for the same old big block shills which no one cared about. Miners had publicly agreed years ago in Hong Kong to activate segwit exactly until the month in which they did activate it.

&gt; Bitcoin users wouldn't stand for that and organized themselves to activate the segwit rules without the miners.

Speak for yourself. I'm a Bitcoin user and I wasn't fooled by this scam fork. I never ran that scam node software. Same with &gt;99% of us. Your scam really never caught on.

All that users needed to do and did was to run the real segwit client, which is Bitcoin Core, and let the miners activate segwit when they may. UASF looks more like an attempt to allure miners to disable or delay segwit, which failed, partly because not enough users like you were dumb enough to put their bitcoins up for grabs. You guys tried to insult miners, promise things to them and then betray them, allure miners with free bitcoins through a UASF fork and attacks, and all this failed to divert them from their course of activating the real segwit when they promised.

&gt; Miners quickly fell into line without a fight, because that's how bitcoin works on a technical level.

HAHAHA tell me how bitcoin works on a technical level, let's hear the idiotic misconceptions. According to you, consensus rules changes can be dictated by some random central idol figure and his few worshippers and then everyone else has no choice but to follow them. You speak of decentralization and then promote ideas of central planning for bitcoin, which don't work anyway, on a *technical level*. Hypocrite. But you know how bitcoin works on a *technical level*, right?

&gt; They want a digital currency that has a low requirement for trust

Right, and forking bitcoin into a shitcoin, as you attempted with UASF, is not part of this. *We* (apparently not you, that's why you said ""they"") want real segwit on the real bitcoin, not on some worthless forsaken shitcoin. You were forced not to fork off through UASF only because miners activated the real segwit on their own and your UASF shitcoin was ill conceived. Let that not hold you ""hostage"" to the bitcoin miners that you so hate. Go play with your other shitcoins and scamcoins and scam your other scammer buddies there and leave honest bitcoin users alone. Funny you try to insinuate that I'd be into some altcoin when you yourself attempted to create an altcoin with UASF and failed.",1524916502

That is not a mistake; that is by design. They 'admit' this when in their response they tell you that 'this is old news and the devs knew about it for years!' I mean, how much more in your face do you have to get?

The point is, crypto is not going anywhere until we shrug off our 'handlers', namely the BTC, XMR and LTC communities. 3 communities full of moon and lambo dreams while they FUD, brigade and browbeat their way to the 'top' and use manipulation in both social media and the market to play favorites with shit coins so Noobs won't be able to find the gold.

"You're really asking how that is scammy? Come on. Purposefully misleading customers is the definition of a scam.

And no, me calling it a scam is not due to my opinion on which scaling solution is better. What it is based on though, is something called ""consensus through proof of work"", which dictates that changes are only activated on the main chain if the majority of the network (largest proof of work) accepts the change. The Bitcoin Cash change didn't get this consensus and is thus simply not the main Bitcoin chain. By hijacking the Bitcoin name after failing consensus spits in the face of the vision they hold so dear. If they just did the fork and promoted their brand &amp; solution, that would be fine. Many altcoins do it after all. But somehow only BCH is involved on hijacking the Bitcoin name.

Regarding his time spent, Roger himself literally accused Bitcoin of causing deaths because they're developing a new, untested, scaling solution instead of increasing block size.

"Hello makanos26,


Just a tip to start off with, we suggest that in the future you post a clickable link. This makes it easier to reach the referenced article. 

To answer your question, it really depends on what the future will bring. It is estimated that the last bitcoin will be mined in 2140, so we have no clue what the world will look like then and if bitcoin is still relevant. However, we think you are referring to the hypothetical situation where bitcoin is still relevant and widely used. 

On this website [here](http://www.bitcoinblockhalf.com/) you can find an overview of when the reward for miners will halve again and other relevant data. Around 2140 the final block will be mined and from then on miners will only receive the transaction fees on the bitcoin network. There is a lot of speculation whether this will make it profitable enough for miners to keep maintaining the bitcoin network. If the value of bitcoin keeps rising, these fees should be enough to keep mining on the bitcoin network profitable. Furthermore the costs of energy and mining equipment will play a decisive role in this hypothetical situation. 

The reason there are transaction fees are used on the bitcoin network to make it more attractive for miners to keep mining. On the following website [here](https://www.smartbit.com.au/charts/transaction-fees-per-block?from=all&amp;day_average=30) you can find the average transaction fee per block. This can give you an insight of how in the future miners will be rewarded.

With kind regards,

Imo both btc and bch are bitcoin variants.

Users + miners + devs is what make bitcoin work. The problem I have with blockstream is they have made miners the enemy. And users who don't agree with them.

"&gt; it is a tremendous mistake to conflate an orphan (such as happens regularly when (1) miners produce blocks at the same time, or if (2) a miner misconfigures his software hint hint) with a ""chain split"" (such as BCH splitting from BTC).

You are making a tremendous mistake by conflating (1) and (2).  Only (1) is orphaning proper, like it happens all the tim.  If the miners disagree on whether a block is valid or not, then you potentially get a coin split -- depending on the nature of the change and how many miners reject the block 

In that case, that block is NOT said to be orphaned; it will be included in one of the branches

A disagreement on the protocol version tag could be enough to cause a coin split.  That is how the BCH split was done.  A disagreement on the block size limit could be too.

&gt; A dishonest miner can always burn his block reward to disrupt the system, the toxic block isn't unique in this regard. The same miner could just mine empty blocks and orphan non-empty blocks to achieve the same result. When the block size limit was introduced, the cost to mine a toxic block was maybe a dollar.

That is wrong. Again,  If a miner (by malice or accident) mines a block that is invalid for everybody, then he just loses his work.  But if he mines (by malice or accident) a block that is valid for some peers, but invalid by others, the chain may split, depending on the nature of the violation and the percentages on each side.  The risk of splitting HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH COSTS OR INCENTIVES. 

That is why all miners must have the SAME rules to decide whether a block is valid or not. And that is why people call those rules ""the consensus rules"" -- not because they are reached by some sort of converging negotiation among miners over time, but because the miners must all agree to them from the start, and change them together.

&gt; Conversely, someone produced an 8.1MB block on BCH, that block was orphaned

Again, you are wrong.  That block was not just orphaned. It was ignored by some miners for being invalid, and thus they continued building an 8 MB chain without it.  Fortunately for the BCH fans, those ""8 MB"" miners were in the majority.  Then, since the 8 MB chain was valid even for the miners with larger limits (and there was at least one), these miners abandoned that 8.1 MB chain and switched to the 8 Mb one.  ***But if the majority had accepted that block, then the chain would have split in two.**

&gt; even though ever miner on BCH is mining on a client that allows them to trivially adjust their block size

Again, it was just **sheer luck** that the majority of the miners were running ABC with the default 8 Mb limit.

"&gt;No. An increase as small as that would definitely NOT have sacrificed decentralization.

Every single increase has a measurable affect on decentralization. That's a fundamental law of nature. How much affect is subjective and circumstantial.

BTC is focusing on distribution and decentralization at its core. The more people who have access, the better it is for all. It's a long term goal, one step at a time. 

BCH is focused on utility, and making it useful right now, while sacrificing the core principals which BTC was originally intended for - decentralization and incorruptibility. People don't like BCH because, 1. it fundamentally goes against the original concept, and 2. It's marketed like some titty show in the bad part of town.

"The FUD does make a lot of sense at first glance but the more you look into it, the more you go further into the rabbit hole, the design decisions start to make a lot of sense. Specifically:    
&gt;EOS will be extremely centralised. 21 nodes is a paltry sum. Non-full-nodes will not have any way to do lightweight verification, thus multiplying its degree of centralisation.    

It is actually 121 full nodes, 21 of which mine blocks. Non full nodes can verify unless public key cryptography is broken(still going strong as of now(the nodes don't get your private keys, so it is still auditable and merkle tree is easily verifiable). There is still a risk of 2/3 bps colluding to either censor or do something else untoward. If they do, token holders get to kick them out via elections that occur every couple of secnonds or so.
&gt;On top of all of this, the 21 full nodes will be delegates, which are voted in. By necessity, this turns consensus into a political process instead of an automated one. One of the practical effects of this is that the delegate nodes will be known/trusted third parties.    

I think you are right about this but keep in mind the system still works if 1/3 bps are trustable. So yes we do have trusted 3rd party BUT the trusted 3rd party does have a huge financial disincentive to screw you over. Contrast this to ethereum or bitcoin where if the 5 or so biggest mining pools get together, they control the network outright, the person with the most hashrate then is a trusted 3rd party? Anyway you are probably right, eos has had to modify satoshi's vision in order to achieve scalability, and eos is not perfect, the richest people in the world could buy all the tokens and control the network. The holy grail I think would be dpos + identity to enable a crypto democracy as opposed to a crypto oligarchy.

"Brief history lesson for those who might want it: When the size debate was young, Gavin did some testing and felt that 20Mb was good, and after debate on the method moved his recommendation down to 8Mb.

Adam said ""No, 8 is to high, but we'll go with 2.""

""OK, how about 4?""  ""No, 2""

""Well, ok, we'll take 2"".

At this point Adam said ""No, we like 1.  We're staying with 1.""

This short dialog brought to you, to remind everyone about the goalpost shifting.  This was very early in the blocksize debates.  Many other attempts were made to try to find a compromise.  

Greg even told us to go fork if we wanted bigger blocks.  We did not want to fork, but the fee market was already causing terrible experiences for users and merchants.  The only 'light at the end of the tunnel' was Lightning Network, but it was already 18 months overdue with no word from the developers of it.

There was no option that would reduce the fees and allow the network to grow.

I also wrote the first (and shittiest) CashAddr implementation in JavaScript, and I run https://cashaddr.org, so I know a bit more than average about how address formats work.

Maybe if the exchange generated a BCH address, and someone sent BTC to it, and the exchange checks the BCH balance and deletes the private key because it thinks the balance is zero, but that would be a pretty bad bug in the exchange for that to happen.",1524911799

"1. you are demonstrating a tremendous misunderstanding when you conflate an orphan (such as happens regularly when miners produce blocks at the same time, or *if a miner misconfigures his software* hint hint) with a ""chain split"" (such as BCH splitting from BTC).  These are not at all the same thing.  Orphans are natural, to be expected, and cause no particular harm to the ecosystem.

2. You continue to discuss the toxic block attack as though this is a unique threat.  No honest miner will deliberately mine a toxic block.  A dishonest miner can *always* burn his block reward to disrupt the system, the toxic block isn't unique in this regard.  The same miner could just mine empty blocks and orphan non-empty blocks to achieve the same result.

3. I did notice that since last August there are two Bitcoins, I also noticed that the 8.1MB block did not produce two Bitcoin Cashes.  Let's discuss the difference.  In the first case, the users of the system demanded a split.  After **years** of fighting for this split, it finally happened.  The level of difficulty required to produce a sustaining split is simply tremendous.  Conversely, someone produced an 8.1MB block on BCH, that block was orphaned, and within the hour it was like nothing happened -- *even though ever miner on BCH is mining on a client that allows them to trivially adjust their block size* - which you claim can only lead to inevitable collapse of the system.",1524910251

"&gt; while being so remarkably mistaken in so many respects

Your definition of ""remarkably mistaken"" is to speak solely about transactions, rather than saying ""transactions/blocks/protocols"", when talking about transactions and their relations to forks, in the context of transactions. Nice.

&gt; once you understand that a hard fork is the loosening of consensus rules (such that previously-observed rules are no longer enforced) and a soft fork is a tightening of consensus rules, it becomes clear that any hard fork implementation which also includes the addition of new rules or constraints (which would represent a soft fork if decoupled from the new rule relaxations and implemented in a backwards-compatible way) is just a hard fork

A simultaneous tightening and broadening of the rules by, for example, enabling new previously-invalid transaction types and disabling previously-valid transaction types, has properties of both a soft fork and a hard fork. It is simultaneously a soft fork and a hard fork, as it's the same as having a hard fork immediately followed by a soft fork.

There is nothing in the definitions directly stating that if both occur it is to be called solely a hard fork, it's just common to do that, as a hard fork generally speaking has more implications than a soft fork, the same way if you buy a new house and sell your old one you'll generally say you've bought a house, rather than saying you've sold a house, despite both occurring.

&gt; ""enforcing new soft forks is a type of Sybil attack"" is an abuse of terminology

Nice strawman you got there. What I said is that the UASF, which would have nodes attacking the network to stop the propagation of non-SegWit blocks, was being widely supported by the Bitcoin Core community when they didn't have sufficient miner support for SegWit. People were widely suggesting setting up more and more nodes to have a high enough number to successfully launch a sybil attack, forcing the nodes to change to SegWit to not have their income nullified.

Or is it that attempting to launch a high enough number of nodes to subvert the network by not relaying blocks (or transactions) other than the ones they create not a sybil attack?

Likewise, those other proposals I mentioned also had high numbers of nodes being spun up in order to force miners to change their own mining rules, or they'd be facing a sybil attack: they weren't enforced through mining consensus but rather through nodes being spun up to control block propagation and drop blocks that didn't follow the proposal, or under the threat of doing so. They only began gaining miner support once the threat of a sybil attack became more prominent.

And yes, I'd argue that enforcing new soft forks through a high number of nodes controlled by only a few actors (like the few Class C IP blocks that had 200+ nodes, one per IP), despite lack of miner and user consensus, designed to force them to abide by your soft fork or to face losses from the attack, is a sybil attack.",1524909441
"Trying to dictate consensus rules changes (what Luke Daesh jr. is doing, e.g. with the UASF 148 contentious fork, also known as ""fake segwit"") is itself an attempt to centralize Bitcoin. It's a futile attempt, as it doesn't work as advertised, but it nevertheless shows their evil intention. UASF by definition is an attempt to change the consensus rules without consensus. If it worked, then one would be able to change Bitcoin completely and turn it into anything they want. Luke Daesh jr. wants to do this. In fact, he thought that he'd found some magical key to change Bitcoin to anything he wants, whatever other people do. He thought that he'd be able to push his stupid/evil ideas in case UASF 148 failed, too. He thought, or wanted other people to think, that he'd be in control whatever the miners did. Here's what he said - https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6msyk5/if_bip148_fails/dk42z3u/

"&gt; then those miners are orphaned, and must adjust their limits to be closer to those set by other miners.

**WRONG**.  What happens is that those miners go off in a branch of their own -- that is, the coin will split.  Because, by their rules, the other branch is invalid.

&gt; In either case the system quickly converges to consensus. 

The system will get to a consensus only if and when all the miners adopt the same block size limit.  As long as they have different limits, there is no consensus, and a block with wrong size could cause a coin split.

&gt; Which was borne out in reality.

It was not. That situation has not happened yet.  The 8.1 MB block was orphaned because the 8 MB blockers were a majority.  If they had been a minority, the coin **WOULD** have split.

&gt; If there exists such a powerful incentive for all miners to employ the same limit then miners can all configure their clients the same.

Good!  Then, if you love BCH, you should tell all miners to forget about BU and XT, and use ABC  with 8 MB limit.  Because it seems that no one else knows that BU and XT have different limits.  That information is not written anywhere, and I had to use crowbar and sledgehammer to extract it from your wise developers.

&gt; The only way to prevent miners from changing their software in a way that is unacceptable, is to orphan their blocks when they do something unacceptable.

Again, it seems that you don't know the difference between orphaning a block and rejecting it because it is considered invalid.

&gt; The block size limited was introduced as a way of preventing a form of flood attack in which a miner introduces a block that is ""toxically large"" to his peers.

You (or CSW?) must have copied this from some of my posts.  But it seems that you did not understand what ""toxically large"" means.

&gt;  It is as far as I know an entirely theoretical attack that has never occurred IRL. The mere existence of any limit whatsoever is a very strong deterrent against poison-block attacks. 

**WRONG**.  The attack is avoided if and only if all miners adopt the **SAME** block size limit.  The mere existence of a limit will not do, if the value is different for each miner.  In fact, a toxic block is precisely a block that is too large for a minority of the miners, but okay for a majority.

That attack has never happened because, since mid-2010, all bitcoin miners had the same 1 MB block size limit -- which made the attack impossible.  **But it could happen now on BCH, depending only on the miners choices for the limit.**

&gt; No miner wants to fragment the network.

Did you notice that, since last August, there are two ""bitcoins""?

And **why** do you think that someone mined that 8.1 MB block?

&gt; For the same reason that the coin never ""splits""

Assuming that BTC is $10k and his initial fund is $10l.  In which case, he can:

a.  Buy 1 BTC (1x leverage, 100% equity)
b.  Buy 2 BTC (2x leverage, 50% equity)
c.  Buy 4 BTC (4x leverage, 25% equity)

Assuming 0% maintenance, he loses his $10k when:

a.  BTC reach $20k with 1 BTC
b.  BTC reach $15k with 2 BTC
c.  BTC reach $12.5k with 4 BTC

Anyway, he can't lose more than $10k.  Exchanges will impose a maintenance margin (e.g. bitfinex is 15%).  In which case, no matter how much he has leveraged, the exchange will liquidate and force sell when he loses $8,500.  Bitfinex's max leverage is 40% equity or 2.5x.

"**Gaslighting**

Gaslighting is a form of manipulation that seeks to sow seeds of doubt in a targeted individual or in members of a targeted group, hoping to make them question their own memory, perception, and sanity. Using persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, and lying, it attempts to destabilize the target and delegitimize the target's belief.

Instances may range from the denial by an abuser that previous abusive incidents ever occurred up to the staging of bizarre events by the abuser with the intention of disorienting the victim. The term owes its origin to the 1938 Patrick Hamilton play Gas Light and its 1940 and 1944 film adaptations.

Imagine the headache of suddenly not being able to afford your house because all your money is in crypto and it's tanked heavily for 3 months. Crypto will never replace fiat unless it behaves like fiat. And personally I don't see that ever happening. Only a government issued crypto could ever replace fiat.

I'll disqualify the ""you decide"" answer because that removes the need for the question altogether. 

What's left is hashrate vs the wallpaper, which is basically BTC vs BCH. 

But the BTC case makes no sense, because their project is all about not trusting the miners. Evident from the fact that they are willing to even cripple the currency just so every raspberry Pi can check on the miners. Not to mention that mining follows price, which you already exposed as a bad definition. 

Then there's the definition by the whitepaper.  From [here](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/W/white_paper.html): ""...  publish white papers to explain newly developed technologies and can include an explanation of **how the technology was developed, how it is used**, benchmark and other testing results for the technology, statistical analyses, and other information"".

Roger Ver not only owns rbtc, but also @bitcoin and bitcoin(.)com, which spout this misinformation every minute of the day. He now tries to buy rbitcoin.

Bitcoin cash is however an altcoin like the 1000+ others created by a company in Bijing. Roger does the marketing. The goal for bcash is to take over the bitcoin name and destroy bitcoin itself.

The reason you hear so much about bitcoin cash, but not about the other altcoins, is because of the media channels owned by Roger Ver and because the marketing budget is so huge (it‚Äôs literally billions of dollars).

Since 2015, when it became clear that Blockstream is against that and it has control over the community, there's been the proposition to add the change without Core. Gavin and Mike tried to do it in 2016 but were stopped by censorship and DDoS. There were numerous other attempts through the years and in 2017 the Bitcoin ABC developer Amaury Sechet bit the bullet and without waiting for total concensus announced his software will support bigger blocks since August. As I said, many people already supported the idea. Miners and developers moved to his software and created the fork of the old BTC blockchain (the same forking happened with SegWit too, but people had no way to choose because it was a soft fork). Jihan Wu and Roger Ver are just some of the supporters of this change. I'd argue the block increase idea was created by Satoshi, when he [explained](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1347.msg15366#msg15366) how it will be done, thus Bitcoin Cash is the project that Satoshi started, not Bitcoin Core.

"&gt; I don't agree that the SM paper was bad science at all

The SM paper makes a sweeping generalization in its problem statement.  That generalization holds true throughout the paper.  Unfounded generalizations are bad science.  *Doubling down* on them is bad science.  The SM paper basically concludes ""Bitcoin is just broken and won't work.""  It's highly sensationalist.  That's bad science too.

I have continued to poke at that paper since our prior discussions and I continue to believe that once the network is correctly observed according to the ""complete graph"" theory, that the entire thing mostly falls apart.  IOW the most interesting thing about SM isn't that there exists an edge case attack against the network, but actually that there may not exist any such attack at all, if the unproven assumptions that underlie the paper are challenged.

Now when I say ""bad science"" don't misunderstand me.  I think mostly the paper is good science.  Did you miss the part where I said I seriously considered studying under the paper's author?  But good science can be spoiled when it's based on unfounded assumptions and when it makes sensationalist claims that can't be supported.

I was part of a study once to determine if ""gifted and talented"" high school students can correctly identify other ""gifted and talented"" students just based on impressions.  'Thin-slicing' to use Gladwell's terminology.  Turns out, identifying one gifted person and asking him to identify his gifted peers is a highly accurate way to identify high IQ.  I have thin-sliced Craig and found him intelligent.  I believe his intelligence to be of the ""mile-wide inch-deep"" variety, that is, he is very clearly a generalist not a specialist.  I am also a generalist not a specialist.  I have spent quite a bit of my life defending my ideas from specialists who are able to identify gaps in my specialist knowledge that can be used to attack my credibility.  So I am not as swayed as most people when Craig is poked by specialists and found to come up short.  I do not expect ""big picture"" intellectuals to always be correct about the details.  I likewise do not expect detail-oriented intellectuals to always grasp the bigger picture.

We can agree to disagree about Craig's IQ or lack thereof.  I think he's sharp and insightful (and inciteful).  I agree he's dangerous and cringeworthy.  I also strongly believe that to write him off because he's a buffoon is to miss the value he may bring.

WRT your opinion of Stolfi, actually, we aren't far off.  I am also a fan of his.  He'll tell you.  I've even tipped him generously in the past.  I agree that his skepticism has value.  However, he is dogmatic and does not admit when he is mistaken, and that makes him a poor academic intellectual IMO (remember, he holds academic credentials as a CS professor).",1524904640

Crypto like other things before it is just the excuse to shorten the government leash that hold us in check. I was born in a time where reading a letter not addressed to you was a crime and where nobody knew how and on what you spent your money nor did anyone think the government or anyone else had the right to know everything about it. Times have changed without people realising how high the price of those changes is.

The issue is extremely nuanced and it's funny to me that people here think they're smarter than Brian Armstrong, Vitalik Buterin, and many others who have hinted or in some cases openly stated that they think that BTC blocksize should increase.
