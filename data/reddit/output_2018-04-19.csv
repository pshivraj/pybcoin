"&gt;https://coin.dance/blocks - Switch between BCH and BTC and see there are more independent mining pools mining Bitcoin than BCH.

&gt;https://coin.dance/nodes - Same here; I know BCH supporters often argue that non-mining nodes don't matter; I disagree.

BCH use the same PoW than BTC.

Therefore it has the same mining decentralisation.

(Actually probably a bit better because low Transactions fee is good for small mining operations.. their profitability is not killed by onchain fees)

&gt;While there is only 1 reference client for Bitcoin ; there are many more non-reference clients (and teams maintaining them) than for BCH. This can be seen just by looking at the diversity of nodes for BTC/BCH.

One reference client for BTC, all change must be validated by the code maintainer.

It cannot be more centralised.

The last decentralised attempt to get 2MB last November, clearely show that only the core team is in command (with strong influence from blockstream)

They were willing to split the cures on more time than get more capacity onchain (!!)

On Dev point BTC fail dramatically.

&gt;As for ""Distribution"" this is a bit harder to determine. 

Well the ‚Äúponzi‚Äù or ‚Äúhodl‚Äù mentality doesn‚Äôt help BTC distributions certainly.

&gt;Since BCH and BTC have the same genesis block we would expect the coin with greater distribution to have greater ""Coin Days Destroyed"". There would be less older coins moving on the less distributed Coin ; since anyone who wanted to dump coins after the fork would have likely already done so. 

&gt;If the coins were dumped from from one chain to the other; then the chain that was ""dumped"" (in net) would have ""newer"" coins since they'd have moved at the time of the fork. With that reasoning we would expect in general that CDD will be greater with the more distributed coin; since there are more older coins to move around.

&gt;That is what we see for the 7 day window here:
https://fork.lol/blocks/cdd

None of what you bring here demonstrate that BCH is centralised.

If anything BCH is designed to be used, spend, distributed.

Non-monetary are welcome (those typically increase the demand for node.. look ETH)

Basically returning to the original Bitcoin premises.

"Bit of a related story i have:

When i was a I.T technician in 2013 I once had a really odd (socialist/communistic?) student come into our computer store that had a bitcoin ATM. We chatted briefly about it but he literally said 'You should get rid of it, i think its stupid' in a pretty disgusted face.

I responded that i thought it was pretty neat, mentioned some of its benefits as money and i asked why he didn't like it. I cant remember what he responded here but he just doubled down essentially against my statement of it being money.

I finally said in the most non-aggressive way possible that a lot of people come to see it and that he is free to not use it which infuriated him and he walked out in a furor. My boss (Also a bitcoin supporter) overhead some of it and was as clueless as i was to what the hell just happened. After that ive always felt pretty cautious in dialogue.

So I'd say those buttcoiners are the same socialists that hate people having personal freedom (Also known as not having violent control over others).",1524205874

"&gt; Big shout out to Roger for staying on the ball

Don't think Roger had anything to do with the creation of Bitcoin (Cash). As I understand he's just a very vocal investor and uses that ""power"" to help market Bitcoin (Cash) but as far as running it, well nobody runs it and we don't even have just one dev team so it is very decentralised.

&gt; all the hard work and planning it took the devs and miners to leave the blockstream crippled version of bitcoin behind

There wasn't much planning (so there couldn't of been that much hard work) which is why it was somewhat announced and then forked within space of a few weeks. It had to happen as the BCore UASF hat-idiots had forced the pollution of the chain with Segwit and we wanted a Segwit-free chain.

Since then there's been a lot and lot of hard work from talented devs on the node software teams, to people building apps and all sorts of great new tech for the first time. Once hard fork happens in May expect cool apps etc... to increase drastically and existing ones such as memo.cash to work a lot better.

&gt;  especially the viabtc miner always grinding on is amazing work
Lots of miners always grinding on mining, being selfish and profit motivated and nothing else - always thinking of themselves as all good miners should and as how the system is designed.

Perhaps it's because, someday, they don't want to be on the wrong side of a fork invalidating their coins that some kind of majority of people claim is invalid against their own will.

Im not much of a trader but do traders buy back in again at a higher price in a bull market?

PS I agree 100% that the price of Bitcoin will come back up, regardless of how far it drops. For 9.5 years with 100% accuracy BTC has always broke above the previous all time high price and gone way above it, over and over for nearly a decade. This recent time will be no different, in fact the run up might be even greater than the last run, because thats been a pattern too..... That give us 150k Bitcoin easy, because we ran over 2000% on the past bull run. Assume $6500 was bottom we get $130k bitcoin so I'd say we see $150k for a week but maybe touch $175k for an hour or so like the way we touched 20k for 15 minutes but 18k was the price for about a week.

They could get a big % of the mining power, I say big but do not mean 50% not even 30% let's say 10%. On one front they pump alts and then gather btc, on another front they stables exchanges and get some more from fees, and finally they mine, they dump btc enough to make ir not profitable to be mined as a trading market with no rules which globally asign a price to something which is invaluable (a piece of bitcoin cannot be replicated or generated, it cannot be controlled or stopped by anyone, it is as free as the internet really is), was not an obstacle foresought...

They have the resources to mine at a loss for a long long time, they built a system which gets feed by their lever and it will break when enough people say fuck this shit and sell... 

A bet on bitcoin is a bet on the rational, tired, brought to the ground middle class man which justs asks himself ""what for?"" are we tired enough? Do we got the answer? If our existence is meaningless and  just a flash then why not enjoy the hell out of it instead of hitting keys all day ""creating"" something to be sold that no one really NEEDS...

I'M JUST SO TIRED... and shit did people before had it worse... It's not surprise we as a species want drugs, alcohol and entertainment to be distracted from our reality, we fill our silence with our own insecurities I guess is something too true to really think about it as it is just as true as it is scary...

How did adults got through this? How did they decided to bring us here? What in hell were they thinking aren't we enough? Why do I feel teenage angst when I'm no longer a teenager? What is going on? Why...

Well... We do as a species create some amazing shit, I know I'm here to experience everything I can afford to, with the wife by my side!
It's sad that we've been fooling ourselves, adding value to a piece of materia, the real currency here is time and that is finite for us, we  sell our time and we sell it cheap, 50 or 60 years so the next generation has more free time... Or that was the goal before we found out we are going too slow... And we did some stupid decisions along the way, and now some people want to correct it, but we generated enough humans and did not tend to everyone to a point where 99% do not give a shit, do not understand why, nor what...

"**Gold standard**

A gold standard is a monetary system in which the standard economic unit of account is based on a fixed quantity of gold. Three types can be distinguished: specie, bullion, and exchange.

In the gold specie standard the monetary unit is associated with the value of circulating gold coins, or the monetary unit has the value of a certain circulating gold coin, but other coins may be made of less valuable metal.

The gold bullion standard is a system in which gold coins do not circulate, but the authorities agree to sell gold bullion on demand at a fixed price in exchange for the circulating currency.

Let that sink in.",1524202628
"Here is another one of my pet peeves .... all this talk about ""blockchains"" 


99% of everybody on the planet using the blockchain buzzword have no idea when a blockchain is a solution and when it's  not. And also when a blockchain can work and why it works. 

For instance, private blockchains are retarded because if you are going to control who has acces to your blockchain or not ... then why use a blockchain at all? Blockchains are only a solution for providing a system that works in a environment where you can't trust the other participant. 

And the main reason why Bitcoin works is not really a technical one but an economic one. Bitcoin was designed to that the incentive to cooperate within the network are of magnitude higher then the incentives to try to break the rules. 

So any blockchain system that does not have these incentives ... well they are not a blockchain! At least not in the way Bitcoin is.

And so to separate blockchain from Bitcoin is deceitful. 

Having a database stored in a distributed way is not a new invention and so you can't call that a blockchain.  Having a timestamp server is not a new invention and so you can't just call any chain of hashes a blockchain.

Satoshi invented a mechanism, and the totality of that mechanism was called Bitcoin. And the data structure we call a blockchain. 


If you take elements away from that mechanism it will stop working. And if you take elements away from that mechanism and create a totally different mechanism that might work ... then you can't call it a blockchain ...... 


Where people go wrong is that they have no idea what Satoshi was trying to solve. And so when people call something that does not solve Satoshi his problems, Bitcoin ... well that's not fair! Go come up with your own name! 
",1524202599
"Because the post wasn't about a coin at all. It was about, as the title and link should explain, Memo.cash. Which is the first of its kind, a social network running completely on the blockchain. 

This is revolutionary for crypto in general. Bitcoin Core supporters need to be aware of this and I thought posting to their sub would suffice. 

I've been a long time BCH fan and haven't ever gone out of my way to promote BCH on r/bitcoin. To do so is to be banned, we all know this. I want to participate in Bitcoin discussion as much as the next person and wasn't intentionally jeopardizing myself.

"Very much so. I think a lot of people had their interest piqued during December and were interested in buying in, but didn't. Many will see this crash as a way of validating to themselves what they already thought ""See! I knew it was a bubble! I'm glad I didn't buy in after all!"" but if the market does recover and btc climbs over its last ATH, I think there will be a lot of ""wow, if it can recover even *from that*, maybe there's something to this thing after all"".",1524202543
"XVG advertised as a private crypto solution to a broad audience when you could know the only blockchain privacy feature is a plagiate (open source license broken) and furthermore this privacy feature is old tech from 2014 already deanonymized with several research papers.

So basically one of the bigger cryptocurrency adoptions is build on lies risking users privacy knowingly. I personally thought that a privacy sensitive service on a big scale would do their research before adding a crypto. Apparently they did not or the few millions of dollars blinded them.

I expect a ""data leak"" regarding Verge in the future hurting cryptos as a whole. Best solution would renowned tech sites auditing the Verge privacy and publishing their results before this is a data leak.",1524202532

"The short answer is No.

Why will people pay fees and how much should they pay, are all pertinent questions. 

We are not expecting anyone today to be alive to see that happen but here are some of the variables to consider. 

1. we need economies of scale, lots of users paying low fees to be effective money.

2. there will always probably be some free translations (ultimately necessary to keep bitcoin fungible - you can,t have 0.1BCH with 50 inputs be worth less than 0.1BCH with 1 input.) 

3. Miners won't mine at a loss, so if there is a technical limit they will balance supply and demand and the fee will vary according to market forces, so yes there could be some variance in fees. Competing miners will optimize for unique use cases.  

4. users will ultimately pay for utility some times it'll be security some times priority. Should fees and demand ever drop to a point where miners turn off equipment, collective groups of people like an exchange could prioritize payments by increasing the demand incentive, encouraging miners to boot up extra hashing units. 

Ultimately the fees are going to start to solidify as the mining reward is halved every 4 years. ",1524202171
"Bitcoin can also fragment.

Lets say we fragment the world internet in 4 isolated regions.

The bitcoin community on each of those areas can lock custom nodes with replay protection from each other, so if ever the connection between any of those parts are reestablished, you will have 2/3/4 different forks.

While the reconnection dont happen, each fork will have a different price because the demand between the different regions would be probably different.",1524202140

This is odd because he didn't do anything illegal. You could say the same thing about people donating money to a school to use for a new Sports Complex, or to add instruments to the band room. Just because he offered money for a specific purpose does not make the act illegal or inherently morally wrong.

Also odd, the event didn't have anything to do with any particular coin. And Roger's tweet doesn't say that it was a BCH event. Could there not be BCH supporters at a conference called ""Free the Blockchain""?

From my perspective, as a BCH supporter, Bitcoin Core/Blockstream has completely choked BTC and its development. I would see the title of the conference and be interested as BCH promotes a free and open blockchain.

But, assuming either BTC or BCH (as we call them today) actually does survive to the point where the block reward runs out, that would almost certainly mean it was massively adopted.

However, because only 0.1% mine the old version, the coins will need (10 minutes x 1000%) to mine the next block.

So then profits go to those that produce...important stuff like food. You see where this is going? We could all choose what to do with the surplus of our labor and save the rest. 

We create wealth by using real money. For a cool trick, take your rapidly devaluing fiat currency and purchase real money with it. Hodl the real money until the collapse of rampant imperialism. Congrats, you now have actual wealth. So what I‚Äôm saying is... buy bitcoin.",1524197006
"Margin trading = borrowing money to buy larger amounts of an asset (in this case, crypto).  If you margin trade $100 with 10x leverage, you essentially borrow $900 to make a $1000 trade.  This can help you get massive gains, but can also lead to devastating losses.  

A squeeze refers to people ending trades at a loss.  To give an example, the number of people shorting BTC (i.e. betting its price will decrease) reached an all time high right before the price boom on April 12.  All of the people betting BTC would go down were ""squeezed"" out of their position, either because they had a stop loss or their margins were liquidated.",1524196977

"I‚Äôm not really an anarchist, I‚Äôm really just learning and challenging my positions continuously. I drift in between limited, and thus more accountable government, and none at all; then I run up against some of my own contradictions that I haven‚Äôt worked out yet.

But also, I think your classification is wrong to call Bitcoin democratic. It is democratic in so far as there is meritocracy and thus governance loosely in the way Plato may have envisioned the Republic. 

However, it is heavily decentralized, voluntary (I have no qualms with voluntarism in any capacity) to participate in, and there are immutable laws/or principles that can not be changed. Ironic, or maybe not so ironic at all and in fact deliberate, is that the rules that can not be changed actually are there to preserve each individuals inherent and basic rights‚Äîliberties.

This is the exact opposite of what happens in our democratic society. The philosophy and understanding of universal rights are all but forgotten.  All democratic policy is constantly distorting and subverting the will of the individual, by its very nature, for the sake of the ‚Äúminority‚Äù or for fear that someone evil somewhere might do something. If we can not trust a people with their freedom, how can we trust a people to vote for their rulers?

As Ayn Rand once praxeologically deduced: ‚ÄúThe smallest minority on earth is the individual. Those who deny individual rights cannot claim to be defenders of minorities...‚Äù

"The bottom line is if everyone owned some  bitcoin supply and demand would make them so rare they would be fought over and the price would surge pushing up all the other coins with its massive gravita! The truth is most people have evacuated Bitcoin for alt-coins, tokens and privacy crypto's and this is what has made the bare market. I am guilty of this myself. There are millions of us holding 1500 different coins. If everyone held at least  25% Bitcoin we would be helping our selves out. If we could run a massive campaign to spam the crypto sphere telling everyone why it's so important that everyone hold positions in Bitcoin we could change the market over night. God Bless.

"Ya exactly. What I'm curious about is if next year will have a beginning of the year dip because ppl will learn from this year and sell.

2. It‚Äôs true that tampering with data stored on a blockchain is hard, but it‚Äôs false that blockchain is a good way to create data that has integrity. Is Coinbase trustworthy?  What software do YOU use to convert your bitcoin ?  Why has so much bitcoin (hundreds of millions) been stolen if Decentralization builds so much trust?

*next*. Auditing software is hard! The most-heavily scrutinized smart contract in history had a small bug that nobody noticed ‚Äî that is, until someone did notice it, and used it to steal fifty million dollars.

3. Keep your Overseas Aid records in a tamper-proof
repository not owned by anyone‚Äù sounds right ‚Äî yet is your Afghan villager going to download the blockchain from a broadcast node and decrypt the Merkle root from his Linux command line to independently verify that his aid has been recieved? Or will he rely on the mobile app of a trusted third party ‚Äî like the nonprofit or open-source consortium administering the aid or providing the software?

"Say Im a cryptoadvocate and I have a website/blog where I publish content. Now lets also say I want to publish an address where readers can donate bitcoin to.

"Say there are 100 people with BTC on exchanges.  &gt;90 of those 100 people are trying to buy altcoins with BTC, while only &lt;10 are selling.  This graph represents a bunch of different BTC-alt pairings (refer to the bottom of the page where it says ""Buy Markets"" to see which markets are &gt;50% buy orders) and is an aggregate of all of those.    

The data shows that the altcoin market has an insane amount of buying pressure right now, which will drive their price up.  BTC-fiat markets aren't represented here, but since BTC value is increasing we can assume the buy market is fairly substantial.  It seems like we found the bottom in March and will have a nice recovery, at least in the short term.",1524196007

"You‚Äôre right, and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs only good for short term buying low and selling high. If ETH and BTC make up most of your portfolio then it‚Äôs a good app to use fiat on ",1524195950
90% of the all the orders on exchanges are people trying to buy bitcoin. 10% of all orders on exchanges are people trying to sell.

If there are no transactions, isn‚Äôt there 98% fewer fees for miners?

"If Bitcoin is ""trustless"" then you have to explain the software you use and TRUST to exchange your bitcoin every day. to process your transactions, and why and HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS in bitcoin have been stolen from exchanges that people trusted. Is coinbase trust-less? 

You'll always need to trust a 3rd party to exchange your coins. Or store parts of the ledger on THEIR computers. Unless you write your own code . 

Blockchains ""value proposition"" is different from it's technology is. It's value prop is : ""What if everyone keeps their records in a tamper-proof repository not owned by anyone?"" and it's technology is : ""a very long sequence of small fies ‚Äî each one containing a hash of the previous file, some new data, and the answer to a difficult math problem ‚Äî and divide up some money every hour among anyone willing to certify and store those iles for us on their computers.""

It‚Äôs true that tampering with data stored on a blockchain is hard, but it‚Äôs false that blockchain is a good way to create data that has integrity.

"It will pretty much do the opposite really. Look at the altcoins right now that don't have any USD pairings (most of them). When people trade their BTC for these coins they go up in satoshi and thus up in fiat. There isn't as much of an arbitrage opportunity here so when they got hot there is not automatic sell pressure. Now lets look at what happens when they get paired with fiat in an example. 

Lets take a look at shitcoin. A has always been paired with BTC in an A/BTC pairing but now it also gets an A/USD pairing. In the past if people wanted to cash out A they had to sell it back for BTC and then sell that BTC for fiat. If the Sat price of A went up on exchange 1 the only arbitrage opportunities would be on the same A/BTC pairings on other exchanges. So as A went up on Binance people would buy on the other exchanges for the lower prices and immediately sell the more expensive A on Binance for guaranteed profit. If demand is strong enough the price rises on all exchanges despite this arbitrage. In this scenario the Fiat price of A is merely a derivative of the real price discovery in satoshi. 

Now Binance adds an A/USD pair. Bitcoin is trading at 10,000/coin. A is trading at 100/coin on the A/USD pair and .01 on the A/BTC pair. Say we get a rally like we have been having the last few weeks. There is not a net increase in fiat coming into the system (as evidenced by a stagnating BTC. If people were buying alts with fiat rather than with BTC they already hold then BTC and alts would both be rising on and off because BTC has to be bought first in order to purchase many of the alts pumping right now) but market cap and many alts are rising because they are primarily priced in BTC and this BTC is being traded into the sell side of most ALT's order books right now. People start trading their BTC for A and push the price from .01 to .11. So A is worth 100 in USD but 110 dollars in bitcoin. Not only is there sell pressure from arbitrage on other exchanges on the A/BTC pair but now we have a whole new set of direct fiat arbitrage opportunities. People will immediately start buying that A for $100 and selling it for .11 BTC making a risk free 10 dollars. This increase in arbitrage opportunities will reduce volatility while also hurting the market as a whole by reducing BTC's roll as the reserve currency (something that adds value to the whole market).",1524195609

"From a cursory glance over the Signal protocol, it looks like it uses Curve2559, rather than secp256k1, so it wouldn't be compatible with bitcoin keys. However, you could probably use ECIES to exchange Curve2559 keys, and then use the blockchain as a medium to store subsequent Signal messages - thus removing the need for any central server for Signal messaging.

One potential problem though with Signal messages stored on the blockchain is the fact that clients have to attempt to decrypt every message. Since Signal creates new keys for every message (I believe, I'm not deeply familiar with the protocol, but learning as I write this comment), clients would need to attempt to decrypt every message with multiple different keys. This increases the complexity required of the client compared to ECIES, and also is a potential scaling concern (if a user has hundreds of conversations, they are forced to do hundreds of times more decryption operations under Signal than under ECIES).

Also, I'm not sure how large Signal messages are. ECIES messages are 49 bytes of overhead, plus whatever the size of the ciphertext is (which is usually about as long as the plaintext with AES). I imagine Signal messages must be larger because they also have to communicate the key for the following message.

So, in my view, based on what I understand of the Signal protocol so far, ECIES is a more appropriate messaging scheme for bitcoin private messaging.",1524192881

Increasing the block size would technically solve any ""not enough block space"" problem, but using it as a catch all solution for every problem is lazy.  Batching is a better solution because it actually reduces the transaction size with no downside. Batching is an old feature, too, it's just been brought up recently because it turns out exchanges didn't hatch their transactions, needlessly inflating the value of block space.

"&gt; Can you give some example blockchains with layer 2 scaling solutions on their mainnet? 

Nano.  IOTA.  Litecoin.  Ethereum.

Just because you can do something does not make it a good idea.

&gt; bleeding edge innovations such as lightning network,

lol.  LN is fraught with problems.  Would you like to explain to people how LN's only routing system is literally:

1. Broadcast and track the *entire network*
2. Pick a random route to the destination; You cannot know or find out if this route will actually work until you try
3. Send payment and hope for the best.  If it fails, the money will come back to you and stop locking up every channel along the way... eventually.  Might be a few hours if someone decides to fuck with LN, which they can do easily without any consequences.
4. If it failed... You may or may not find out why.  Then you pick another random route and try again.
5. If it keeps failing, you give up and open a new LN channel to the destination.

Oh, yay, money was sent after an onchain transaction!  And now both LN, the receiver's funds, AND the utxo set are even more fragmented than they were before!

I'm sure you didn't realize that ""routing"" worked like this.  After all anyone who explains how it actually works - or discusses any problems with LN at all - gets banned from your safe space.

Oh well, stay uninformed.

&gt; segwit 

Segwit was not a bleeding edge innovation by any stretch of the imagination.  It was an ugly hack.  It functions, but it makes everything unnecessarily complicated and avoids addressing several real problems all in favor of simply avoiding a hardfork.

But you wouldn't know that because you don't know what segwit actually did or how it did it.  Or maybe you can prove to everyone that you're not totally clueless... Tell me, why do segwit transactions have two script fields when everything can be done with only one script field?

&gt; schnorr signatures?

You mean the thing that isn't actually live yet and only provides any benefits for users that change their behavior and don't send simple transactions like 95% of the userbase wants to?  Stunning innovation, much wow!

But you wouldn't know that either.  Real information about what these things do and don't is banned from /r/Bitcoin.

It's also great for vendors who want to serve those people. It does absolutely nothing for anyone else. The real point of BTC isn't to be used super fast as point of sale. The point is to be able to use it for things that would otherwise require permission / exchange / multiple fees / divulging identity.

"&gt;Segwit adoption has dramatically increased; more wallets, exchanges, users, all support it. Including, finally, Coinbase.

So from just before the spike, a high of 18% and a low of maybe 12% averaging closer to the low spectrum. (Looking at data after the 18% spike 506555). After spike a low of 26% and a high of 35%. Using data from [segwit.party/charts](http://segwit.party/charts/). Ok, their's a minor increase and it could have an impact on transaction fees, but I think that impact would be minor.

&gt;Transaction batching by exchanges has dramatically increased, making much more efficient use of the blockspace available.

I can't find any solid info for this. Link it if ya got it.
&gt;Millions and millions of UTXOs have been consolidated.

You are right that the UTXO set has been consolidated. See [blockchain.info/charts/utxo-count](https://blockchain.info/charts/utxo-count). Good thing they can afford to consolidate their transactions because their was high demand, up to 55% OF ALL UTXOs became unspendable because the fees outpriced the value of the utxo. [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7kt3zl/what_of_addresses_are_unspendable_at_this_point/). If you keep the ""fee market"", this will be the norm.

&gt;The lightning network has been deployed on mainnet. And while it's not offloading any significant number of transactions at this time, it is still a major technological achievement that shows the way forward will work.

So nothing right now.
&gt;RSK launched, and while few people seem to notice or pay attention, the fact that there are functional sidechains is still a pretty big deal.

So also nothing right now.

1 - Built from scratch, not some copy and paste job from ETH, BTC or LTC
2 - It's not just a blockchain, but a platform like ETH, the ecosystem can house multiple tokens (NEP-5), allowing ICOs and other ventures to exist on the platform

BTC - $16,733



Well look at that... all LTC did was basically follow BTC in the market (like almost every other crypto).

BTC is more centralized.,1524188301
"We have a fundamental difference of opinion on that as I rate non-mining full nodes as borderline meaningless to the network if you're not an economically significant actor (by economically significant I mean some who's rejection of blocks has meaning, such as an exchange or payment processor). Certainly not worth crippling BTC to ensure Raspberry-pi level hardware can run one. And ""kicking the can"" is pretty much the norm for computer engineering in my experience, if that's what's required to keep the user experience satisfactory. 

This is pretty much the philosophical difference that caused the BCH chain to be formed. So that's fine.",1524188277
"Eth is rising faster than btc. Not being a dick, but you should wrap your head around this if you want to successfully stick around.",1524188274
"Typical with new technologies is the early investors support the first innovator and miss the big investment opportunity. 

Bitcoin had the better tech and the first mover advantage. 

Not everyone in this space is going to make money dispight this probably being the biggest inventmentoppotunity in human history. 

The most valuable thing I think you can do is make your on decisions. 

Read the white paper it's written in simple English then read the LN white paper. 

The ideas that'll be understood by everyone are the ideas that spread. 

You decide. 80% of bitcoin BTC and BCH have been issued. Those on guilty of group think have sold their BCH


Most investors in bitcoin hold both. It's only a few who know with certainty that 1MB is the perfect transaction limit that never needs to be changed and can product the future winner. 

",1524188268
"If we assume Lightning Network can someday be made to work as promised (decentralized, robust, and 100% usable), every crypto will utilize it.

This is the bulk of the reason BTC is dead in the water, even if LN works it will offer zero competitive advantage to BTC.",1524188231
"They're pulling an AOL.

I'm guessing they saw a steady decline in user numbers over the years (probably due to crypto) and came up with a number of how many users would be loyal to the platform if rates were raised by whatever amount. Less people, more fees. Most likely they figured out that people who would leave the platform for alternatives wouldn't be the one paying the new fees anyway.

There will still be millions of people around the world using PayPal for years to come, just as there are about 25 million people that still use AOL to connect to the internet in 2018 (with 2.1 million still using dial-up). Now AOL focuses more on security for the insecure, and PayPal has been emphasizing that more recently, as well.",1524188164
"Do that 20 more times and it's ~ 20,000 bitcoin! =)
",1524188123
"Okay, explain to me like I'm five the term fork in crypto then. I always assumed that every fork had a coin created from it. (Bitcoin cash, Bitcoin gold, etc) if you're saying that you can fork without creating a new coin why isn't it just an update to the protocol. Why use the term fork in this situation at all? If that's the scenario. ",1524187993
If Bitcoin takes a shit I promise alts will outpace it on the way down too,1524187979

We‚Äôre in a bull run right now and Alts are out pacing BTC currently. Especially OmiseGo,1524187887
I wouldn‚Äôt touch 98% of the ERC20 tokens actually. P3D is akin to an open source computer program running on the Etherum blockchain. Don‚Äôt you guys get it?? Bitcoin is centralized. Ethereum is centralized. Controlled by ASIC miners. P3D is a smart contract. No humans. ,1524187887
"There are three outcomes over the next few months. BTC could go up, BTC could go down, or BTC could stay the nearly the same. Doesn't matter to me what way the price goes over the next few months. I rather it go down so I can buy more month to month. I hope for a slow climb to 18k by the end of the year. I really don't want to see 50k this year. I want to buy as much as I can now while the coins are cheaper.",1524187825
"They've held over 10 btc worth of crypto in my account from me for over half a year, support has stopped responding and I've complete all KYC. I'd advise staying away from them. I am not the only person with funds locked up in bittrex. ",1524187821
i think the bitcoin association is to valuable,1524187816
"Damn, BTC is only 8200 and you're already in green.",1524187813
Blah blah blah. It cost me 2 cents to move $30k of bitcoin the other day. Fees were high at all time  highs ... but SegWit has been implemented by some big players and the fees are next to nothing. I want my bch to retain or grow in value but bch offers less than nothing that bitcoin does. ,1524187806
"Bitcoin investors can choose exactly which lot they want to use when making trades. 

https://www.investopedia.com/university/definitive-bitcoin-tax-guide-dont-let-irs-snow-you/definitive-bitcoin-tax-guide-chapter-1-trading-gains-and-losses-c-lifo-fifo-offsetting-lots.asp

&gt;The fact that bitcoin traders have the right to calculate their cost bases using one of several different methodologies makes the questions of tax reporting and enforcement even more complicated. Because bitcoin is taxed as personal property, investors have the option to sell their assets on a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) basis, a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) basis, or they can sell specific tax lots that are most efficient via the ‚Äúspecific share identification‚Äù method that is commonly used in stock trading. Which of these options a trader decides to use may have a major impact on the calculations of both long- and short-term capital gains.",1524187719
For new people: r/btc was created long before the BCH Bitcoin fork. r/btc is and always has been full of og people who love Satoshis invention and don't want it captured.,1524187701
"A lot of folks I respect in the Crypto Community are in KIN. I've been on the sidelines long enough. I like the fact that its going to have real world useage and adoption, on a level thats really un\-matched by any other crypto thus far is huge. It's unique as well, which is exicting. Feels boring when owning a crypto that literally does the same thing as 5 other cryptos and you're not only hoping for adoption, but hoping it holds up well vs it's compeititon.  ",1524187687
"A BTC bull run would almost definitely drop Satoshi value and alts wouldn't rise much.  The bull run always goes BTC, ETH, alts",1524187641
"Most of us who are interested in Bitcoin for more than just greed are intersted in it because it's peer to peer, and we think those kinds of relationships are healthier, even if they are ""more expensive"" in a superficial way.  Getting to know your neighbors and doing business with them instead of the cheap crap corporations will improve life for everyone, since it increases the resiliency of your community to keep things local and personal.

And it sounds like you are making assumptions and excuses instead of actually trying to do something new, which is what Bitcoin is all about.  If you just want to stick to whatever you were doing before, that's fine, but why hang out here where we talk about the future and how we can change things to be better for everyone?",1524187608
"I wish I knew about crypto technology to answer that question. If you do want more information about how a universal wallet works, ethos has a great white paper. It doesn‚Äôt go into the technological details but it does offer some nice insight as to what the wallet does",1524187607
"So you bought 100 million in Bitcoin cash, is that what your saying?",1524187584
 Nice observation. We're getting ALT runs at a relatively low BTC. Can't wait for a BTC bull run.,1524187579
"That's just FUD that was spread around here (also, evil MBAs!). No one can gain control of Bitcoin.",1524187577
"Who knows. I have a feeling that with all that‚Äôs gone on with ltc that it‚Äôll no longer be a top contender. Despite what the good ol litecoin sub says, I personally say it‚Äôs overalued. 

I really think the only reason it had its initial run from 65-395 was because bitcoin holders were looking to cash out quickly when btc hit 20k. The bitcoin transactions were so backed up that people figured out they could buy litecoin with ther bitcoin and ltc got its bull run. ",1524187535
I know last time I sent Bitcoin the mining fee was 12 dollars and it tool over an hour to get it's destination..  That BTC and lighting network with its segwitted shnorr signature left me broke and limp.,1524187516
"It's 8 pages. You should read it. 

The important part is that it shows a way to allow a person to send value to another person without any Bank or lightning hub in the middle, or any other middleman. Without having to trust anyone (like a watch tower). Without waiting hours for a backup up mempool. Without paying anything but a penny or so. And you can even send a penny.

This *works*. That's what BCH is doing today, right now. You can try it with SMS.

BCH *also* does everything that BTC ever could, but now finally, faster and cheaper. So when people find this out, they'll (and they already are) they'll use the Bitcoin that works well and stop using the Bitcoin that doesn't work very well anymore and hopes that a payment shuttle network will help it.",1524187506
"Bitcoin BTC has fallen to centralised controle. 

LN sounds good and all until you realise its a nice story and can't offer the benefits of a typical bitcoin transaction.

At the end of the day we are all speculating on future use cases and adoption. 

Bitcoin BTC has theoretical scaling plans that depend on technology that has not yet  and may never be deployed. 

It's not dead most people here are moving on. 

",1524187499
"I am a BCH fan, but with your definition, 'winning' loses all meaning since it becomes impossible to lose.

There has to be a way for BCH to be losing, if you want to celebrate winning.  Saying BCH won because its the original Bitcoin - as true as that is - makes it impossible for BCH to be 'losing'....",1524187473
"Totally sarcasm lol. I've been invested in Bitcoin for 5 years. 

I don't like when people call it ""Bitcoin core"" is all, it's Bitcoin. The one and only Bitcoin. ",1524187471
"check the backlogs in transactions. spikes make btc unusable as 0 conf wont work with low fees.

bitcoin needs room to breathe to function properly.


business cant use a currency with such unreliable fees.",1524187399
"Because cryptos are absolutely useless as currencies if they are so volatile and they will be unable to solve a real world purpose. These gains exist only because people expect crypto to be worth something huge in the future but paradoxically, volatility is really bad for a currency. There will be millons of others who believe in the tech so you may leave if speculating is your only objective in this space",1524187376
"&gt; Volunteerism can't do it.

That's the con that corporations and their governments are pulling. 

The reality is that all living organisms naturally are motivated to create, explore, and share great stuff that improves life.  That's literally what evolution programs us for.

But humans have this little extra thing where we can be infected by religions and memes and belief systems and advertising and so we can be convinced to go against our natural instincts and do something that is dumb, and uncurious, and greedy, instead.  Which messes the whole system up just like any dangerous virus.

A social media forum is easy to do in a decentralized, egalitarian way.  I've been doing it for decades.  There is no silly complex fancy equipment needed beyond the normal communication tools.   I'm not sure why you would think it would.

&gt; so rules can't be enforced by algorithm

There are no rules.  A decentralized system doesn't force rules on individuals.  The individuals make the rules themselves.  That's the whole point.  If you are participating, you are helping create the functionality of the community.  No one individual or group has control over the others.  (Which isn't totally the case with Bitcoin, which is a part of it's vulnerabilities.)

There is no such thing as an ""attack"" on a conversation community, except for the rare cases of actual spam, which is, as I said, normally easy to deal with through self-regulation, where individuals vote up or down.  Or a reporting system can help catch them, if you want to go that route.

But ultimately, it sounds like you're making excuses for not even considering it.  It works.  It's good.  Maybe you like someone else telling you what you can and can't read, and having an authoritarian government controlling your interactions with others, but that's the thing many of us who are intersted in Bitcoin find so harmful to our world.  So we are looking to get rid of that approach to our relationships.",1524187359
"Paypal is the scummiest company ive ever delt with. Unfortunately theirs basically a gun to my head forcing me to use them atm or go broke. I've tried to ditch them several times over the years but they've engrained them selfs with buyers who refuse to use other payment methods.

Their basically a bank without any of the banking systems regulations/oversights with a monopoly and very low morals.

Thankfully i can see that changing in the next few years. Not so much to btc but other viable competition coming out, one of which MAY be btc. Thats is btc can ever get its shit together to eliminate learning curves and simplify onramps for even the tech illiterate.",1524187342
"When you say my lightning network, do you mean bitcoin lightning network ? Will lightning network benefit to bitcoin cash as well or i'm mistaking ?",1524187327
Give them props for calling it BTC and not Bitcoin.,1524187307
"I would say...patience, BTC will have its run. Timing this market is damn near impossible ",1524187267
It is obviously quite a bit more complicated than my metaphor can depict. But OP asked for a layman's explanation. Not everybody has been around since Satoshi and has followed everything and learned everything there is to learn about Bitcoin and its recent history ;-),1524187263
Nice answer but you missed the main reason for keeping blocks small: decentralization.  Without that bitcoin is nothing.,1524187254
"There was a time when OMG was $16 and BTC was 15K. Hypothetically speaking, if BTC reaches 15K what would OMG price be then? 

Or will BTC eventually leave alts in the dust at some price point?",1524187222
When Bitcoin value in USD drops from 2.5 million to 1 million. A phase known as the big drop. Lol wouldn't it be nice,1524187219
"Thanks. I try to keep up on crypto news, at least the news that matters. Though It's hard to sift through the BS. I'm already invested in IOTA but it looks like I seriously need to look at NEO as well. ",1524187206
"Use BTC for a while, you will understand.  (hint: the fees will go high the more BTC becomes popular and Blockstream wants to see transaction fees in the hundreds of dollars some day - that's what they are planning for).  Good luck.",1524187195
"Also, I think it is quite telling what the market is thinking about BTC/BCH. BCH is surging ahead whilst BTC sleeps. The flippening can occur at ANY moment and it will take less than a day to complete. People could switch over to BCH and everything could resume normal function within 24H. It will be like a lightning bolt (excuse the pun)",1524187155
I don't think it was that at all:  it was an attempt to gain control of bitcoin by a bunch of CEOs.  Dressed up as a compromise (which actually neither side of the blocksize debate wanted).,1524187150
I don't understand your sentence. Atomic swap can come when it comes but for now what is preventing you to use your money with bitcoin instead of bitcoin cash ? Everyone seems fighting against something in bitcoin but i don't understand why,1524187110
Would be awesome. Especially for people just jumping into crypto. Explaining the process as simple as it may be keeps a large group of new money out of alts.,1524187099
"To help adoption, Satoshi could give a way Bitcoin (BCH) at some pivotal moment...maybe even when BCH is worth a lot.",1524187058
"If the coin is traded with BNB ( XXX/BNB ) then you can just trade the dust to the BNB coin,  then to ETH or BTC.  Not all BTC and ETH trading pairs, but a large percentage of them, with coins being added regularly.  It helps but won't completely illiminate your problem.",1524187013
Nah the other sub sure saying because ppl stop using btc and turn into their shitcash or alts they invested in,1524187005
"I'm not happy about it because I'm mostly in BTC right now. Was thinking that since it's held fairly steady it would be next to go bull...but it hasn't....

",1524186999
"Andreas Antonopoulous [said it best](https://bitcointalk.to/index.php?topic=181168.msg1977971#msg1977971), talking about Bitcoin Core:

&gt; All hail our new overlords. They're not just coders, they are press directors and OWN bitcoin. As they often say, if you don't like it... fork. 
&gt;
&gt; It is exactly like those who shout ""If you don't like this law, LEAVE the country"". 
&gt;

His words, not mine.

TL;DR some really incompetent people messed up BTC so the community forked to take Bitcoin back away from them.
",1524186964
Twas a good day for crypto,1524186963
"I understand how people were brainwashed... even I was opposed to the fork, only being a newbie to the scene at the time. It was only after I did my research and learned about the history of Bitcoin that I realized that I was being misled. I think the problem is that the majority of the sheeples that are supporting Bitcoin Core have only been around for about a year or two!",1524186939
What Blockstream eventually wants with Bitcoin though? ,1524186815
Yup only takes a 60 percent drop for bitcoin team to do something.  Finally fixed a small problem..  Great work for a team of monkeys.  Humans not so much..  good luck with that team behind bitcoin.,1524186772
"My dad's boss is the VP of finance at bitcoin. He thinks this is a going to have a small pull back at $12,000 but he said not to worry. Bitcoin price will continue up and will break ath. ",1524186758
"This upcoming BCH is not going to give you any free coins. Ethereum also has upcoming Hardforks which will not give you any free ethereum.

A hard fork is just an upgrade, nothing more. Free coins appear because there is a contentious fork that changes the protocol during the upgrade and people do not want to go along with it, hence a split in the protocol causing 2 version, hence the free coins from the extra fork.

However, in BCH and ethereum, there is always agreement and no contentious fork except for that one time for eth classic. Bitcoin candy is a project to come up with solutions against quantum computer breaking the encryption security of bitcoin, not really a big thing at the moment.

So no, there is no free coin in the upcoming BCH hard fork.",1524186734
"Well with BTC market cap % dropping down to the 30's, with Bitcoin Cash rising gradually (much more worrying for them than a pump) and with network upgrade about to occur of course they're going to turn auto-moderator on again.",1524186691
"So basically, this article is showing that paypal users will flee to bitcoin because of higher transaction rates?",1524186683
"I agree, I think there will be a huge market for this as people look to unload massive amounts of crypto in single transactions without an exchange holding records and without affecting the price of the token they are trading.",1524186681
"Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin

SegWit is not Bitcoin and Lightning has nothing to do with Bitcoin, other that funding LN channel with funds from Bitcoin (which is no different to converting Fiat to crypto, only you are converting BTC to LN)",1524186671

What's with bitcoin cash?  I got some on a whim (planned to move it into something else pretty quickly) but it's going up more than anything else I have.,1524186500
"BTC pairs are also generally much, much, more popular. So if it's a question of staying pegged to a BTC value or an ETH value, they will stay at a BTC value and let the ETH change. This might be flawed reasoning here, open to feedback",1524186487
"&gt; but bitcoin is the single most advanced project there is. 

Well we all know what you're smoking.  How's the /r/Bitcoin cult going?  Oops, can't use that word, its banned there!",1524186463
Ignore this troll it definitely matters. Gdax you can use limit orders and pay $0 fee. You can also withdraw crypto to any address from gdax for free(They pay all tx fees). They are the same company so you can link your accounts and transfer free/instant between the two.,1524186459

Yeah that sucks when it happens but if you had good reason to set the stop then it's whatever. You should never trade with 100% of your portfolio in a single position. Most trades I do are 1-5% Of my total crypto,1524186251

"Surely gold mining and deposit surveying mechanisms have evolved substantially from the days of panning for gold, there's nothing specific about ore extraction which has exempted it from massive gains in technology and technique we have seen applied to industry globally in the last 100 years. Even if gold hasn't kept up in terms of positive value delta of human productivity (which I don't concede it has, the market value is currently 10x what it was in the 1930s despite greater supply).

I don't see how gold and gold backed currencies are a good example of a deflationary currency. I think Bitcoin and the idea of a nationless extrajudicial algorithmic monetary supply is very unique and unexplored. It isn't a replacement for inflationary currencies and economic management. Not to get too far sighted by looking at next century, but if bitcoin turns out to sap enough economic force from global economies that it demands action then the best choice for global actors will be to interface their economies as layers on top of bitcoin, which is pretty much end game conditions if everything goes well.

Once we're all borrowing and investing on top of bitcoin we will have all the existing benefits of managed economies and inflation, it will just exist as layers on top of bitcoin.",1524186239

Bcash in general marketing seems to use deception to trick new users into thinking Bcash is Bitcoin.

They are so similar in tech though incompatible, when you try to keep the same name and same social presence it only adds to the confusion and will only turn people off. It is just generally not good for Bitcoin and crypto as a whole. 
",1524185885
"Volunteerism can't do it.

A main reason bitcoin works is because it's secured by fees and very expensive hardware. These two things prevent spam, abuse, Sybil attacks, etc. The fees and expensive hardware are not deal-breakers because it's a financial network in the first place, incentivized that expensive hardware, and accepts payments for fees in its own internal currency. Another reason that bitcoin works is because it polices itself with very simple (relatively) scripts - everything that happens is a transaction with meaning that is fully understood by computer. For this reason, rules are enforced entirely by algorithm.

A forum, however, is a social network, not a financial one. The idea of requiring expensive hardware and fees to use a forum will be much more resisted than those same requirements on a financial network. Additionally, the ""transactions"" are content written by humans that can't (yet) be understood by machine, so rules can't be enforced by algorithm. This means you need moderators, and without a way to prevent Sybil attacks, even random selection of users can be Sybil attacked by creating many user accounts.

I don't believe a distributed forum *that runs well at full scale* is a solved problem. You can get systems to work using volunteerism... until they have 800k users all wanting to abuse it for their own profit.",1524185875

Bitcoin Cash sais: lets build more roads. And once these are full too, we build even more roads. Its fast, simple, and immediately effective. Until they are full again of course..

This metaphor misses some critical tradeoffs of both approaches.

BCH is more like saying we need to build more roads, and also the agencies maintaining those roads have to remember each time every car has ever taken one, forever, and share this increasingly vast records between each other.  The roads can't work without an increasingly vast record-keeping bureaucracy. 

Core+2nd layer scaling is more like building airplanes to bypass the congested roads and the record-keeping bureaucracy.   They quickly go immediately where they need to go.

"No offense taken at all! I'm happy to have skeptical eyes thinking about any possible weaknesses here. It's the only way to truly harden any crypto library.

The code in this library is just an implementation of the ECIES specification outlined by the Standards for Efficient Cryptography Group in the document [SEC 1: Elliptic Curve Cryptography, Version 2.0](http://www.secg.org/sec1-v2.pdf) (pdf). (Incidentally, this is the same working group that defined the secp256k1 elliptical curve used by bitcoin.) So, while it is possible this library has bugs in the implementation, I would not say that this is a case of me rolling my own crypto. Fortunately, the [actual code](https://github.com/jamoes/ecies/blob/003751015e38eb07f3d150516ee4937e6f5fce51/lib/ecies/crypt.rb#L65) for encrypting a message is quite short, so it's relatively straight-forward to review.

There are only 6 million people in the entire crypto market, Kik alone has 15 million monthly users (and that's just one digital platform). If Kin becomes popular with the masses then demand for the token will far exceed the supply.

"&gt;The net effect of Selfish Mining is to drive up the effective difficulty for competitors, but to do it one must also raise their own effective difficulty (meaning: difficulty of adding a block to the chain, not just finding one).

You're writing this in an incredibly opaque way that conflates well defined Bitcoin terms like ""mining difficulty"" with more colloquial definitions of ""difficulty,"" and the above quote provides a great example. In some colloquial sense finding blocks becomes harder because more of everyone's blocks get orphaned, but the actual mining difficulty of finding a block is unaffected until difficulty adjustment when it actually adjusts down not up.  So with more terminology precision nothing you're staying above really holds up.

So, if we could come up with some scheme, like maybe GHOST, where miners were incentivized to add orphan block headers to a block they had just discovered, and those orphan blocks factored into the difficulty adjustment, it's at least possible that we could render SM unprofitable. A miner doing SM is strictly less profitable than he would be if he was not doing SM before the difficulty adjustment lowers the difficulty. If difficulty did not adjust downward the only advantage conferred by SM would be a disproportionate number of blocks the SM would get to add to the chain at the expense of profits. Whether this result is worth the many downsides of such an approach is something I'm still skeptical about.

Bitcoin has more than 400 developers, of which some are well recognized world leading cryptography/cryptocurrency experts. It should be easy to draw the conclusion which is better without going into any technical detail.
The problem with Bcash is not about the technology at all, although its technology is inferior. It is not even about decentralization, which it fails totally, which makes it totally valueless. It's about it is created by a cheater (AsicBoost) and backdoorer (AntBleed). Few altcoins are more scammy than Bcash. Bcash does not resolve any problem in Bitcoin. It is an altcoin with virtually no users and every altcoin without many users has low fees and fast confirmation times.""

"That makes all the sense right there.  What I don‚Äôt understand is, all that hashrate for security on the main chain, but LN nodes are secure too because? How does an underlying chain secure a side chain?

Can we add funds to LN nodes? How the f is this supposed to work. It‚Äôs really confusing to the average business owner who wants to accept and use bitcoin / bitcoin cash. Inter-community fighting is the ultimate drawback.

To give some additional background on the eBay/PayPal relationship, eBay is slowly going to scale off of PayPal, though, starting this year and continuing until 2020\-2021. By discontinuing PayPal as the primary payment processor, eBay is projected to save several billion dollars and potentially attract millions of new customers. PayPal is actually a major friction point in eBay as it makes purchasing take several steps and whenever PayPal goes down, eBay payments are affected. Also, eBay going to their own payment system \(with Adyen as the back end payments platform\) opens them up to allowing crypto as a payment option.

5. Stablecoins are making great progress, but this is definitely something which would need to be addressed.

"It's more user friendly and promotes adoption by customers if the vendor bears the fee rather than the customer. This is one of the things that need to change in crypto - TX and infrastructure costs should be covered by those who run businesses, not passed on to the customers. It gets even worse in Ethereum. Micro payments for every step you take on chain. It doesn't matter if it's a few cents or not, it's a psychological barrier and it's user hostile. Imagine a social network that would charge you to sign up, charge you to post and charge you to like a post. Obviously makes more sense if the infrastructure costs are covered by the vendor.",1524182591
"Great work!!!

I don't think people realize what this is, so let me explain.

Many are aware that if you have a bitcoin address, you can ""sign a message"" with your address, which proves the message was authorized by the person controlling the address.  For example, if I'm known to be associated with a certain address, I can sign a message ""jonald was here 4/19/2018"" and everyone can check to see it was actually me that signed this message.  This is known as a *public key signature system*.

However, what the OP has created is something entirely different, which is known as a *public key encryption system*.  In this scheme, anyone can send me an encrypted message that only I can read (without us ever having to exchange keys).  So if you know my address, you can use it to encrypt a message and only I can decrypt it using my private key.  The most famous public key encryption system is ""PGP"" (pretty good privacy).  

I never heard anyone talk about using Bitcoin in this way, so its awesome to see it created.  Again great work and congrats on this achievement!",1524182588
"Look at the top 20 crypto's, they're all about 60% down from their all time high. Once another bullrun hits it could be a year until we see prices like this again. And if the bull run is huge we may never see these prices again. Obviously dont FOMO in, but realize almost all crypto is 60% off as of right now.",1524182496
"Let's say you had a billion dollars worth Bitcoin. And you wanted to double it.

You would fork your Bitcoin. So you had twice as much. You would keep holding your real Bitcoin. And than you would pump up your fake forked Bitcoin as much as possible so you could make your billion dollars, into 2 dollar dollars.

Looks like they wasted a lot of money and don't understand that Bitcoin isn't anonymous...,1524182402
Oh I see you‚Äôre part of the 42% who don‚Äôt know how it works let me explain it to you. You see this guy called satashi made a app where you can click on a coin and get one bit of the coin (bitcoin). As you get more coins you can buy upgrades to your coin. Some of these upgrades include an auto clicker so you can get bitcoins while you‚Äôre not in the app. The whole thing is just a blantent copy of cookie clicker^TM,1524182397
"Apparently its pretty hard to answer a question seriously nowadays. So here goes:

A couple years ago, the community was actively discussing how Bitcoin would scale. The original idea, offered by Satoshi, was to increase the blocksize periodically. On other hand, a lot of new developers came onto the scene and Satoshi was long gone, even at that point. These developers proposed to first and foremost make the blockchain as lean as possible before just increasing the blocksize. There were reasons for this. A blocksize increase is a hardfork (in other words, not backwards compatible). They proposed the SegWit upgrade, which is very complicated, but it could be enabled as a softfork (backwards compatbile) and is thus deemed safer. Reasons against the segwit upgrade (from a technical point of view) is that it takes adoption from users in the ecosystem and it is complicated stuff, whereas a hardforked blocksize increase would be instant and easy to enable.

Long story short, debate raged on for years and consensus was not reached among the community, mostly due to political and economical reasons, which I wont get into. So both camps went forward with their vision. The bigblockers hardforked and increased the blocksize to 8mb. The segwit camp enabled the tech, and adoption is still ongoing, almost a year later.

To put it in a metaphor: Roads are congested. 

Bitcoin sais: lets automate how we drive, lets optimise the cars so that we can jam more cars on the roads, lets push people to start driving smaller cars, so we can fit more on the roads we have, etc. Its smart, complicated, slow and ultimately effective.

Bitcoin Cash sais: lets build more roads. And once these are full too, we build even more roads. Its fast, simple, and immediately effective. Until they are full again of course..

I think its amazing both versions exist, and very interesting. I have my opinion on the best design philosophy, but thats outside the scope of this comment.",1524182325

"Bcash (BCH), aka Bitcoin Cash, is an incompatible fork from Bitcoin. In a nutshell,

1. Bcash is basically a one-man's coin, although he has quite a few influential minions.

2. This man is Jihan Wu. He is owner of Bitmain, a mining hardware (aka miners) manufacturer that produces most of all miners in the world.

3. Bitmain's miners have a secretly embedded cheat named Covert AsicBoost, which gives Jihan's mining farms (but not his customers!) advantages in mining, which results in Bitmain's monopoly in mining industry.

4. Covert AsicBoost is unintentionally disabled by SegWit, a newly activated feature with many merits that gets intensively attacked.

5. Bcash was live at the same time as the beginning of the activation of SegWit.

6. Bcash is basically 100% Bitcoin, with SegWit removed, plus a minor modification claimed to be a better scaling solution.

7. Besides Covert AsicBoost, Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded backdoor named AntBleed. It gave Jihan the power to shutdown any Bitmain miner in the world remotely.

7. Jihan publicly stated he'd attack Bitcoin with his hashpower when Bcash was being created. (He controls a significant proportion of the overall hashpower.) He also implicated he'd use AntBleed in the attack.

Note that unlike the allegations about the devs who created SegWit, Covert AsicBoost and AntBleed have solid evidence and are acknowledged by Jihan/Bitmain.

By understanding who is behind Bcash and what he has done / what kind of person he is, you can draw a conclusion by yourself. This includes 1) why Bcash came into existence? 2) why they attack SegWit?

Bcash has few developers, of which none is well recognized, and near zero development activities. Bitcoin has more than 400 developers, of which some are well recognized world leading cryptography/cryptocurrency experts. It should be easy to draw the conclusion which is better without going into any technical detail.

The problem with Bcash is not about the technology at all, although its technology is inferior. It is not even about decentralization, which it fails totally, which makes it totally valueless. It's about it is created by a cheater (AsicBoost) and backdoorer (AntBleed). Few altcoins are more scammy than Bcash.

Bcash does not resolve *any* problem in Bitcoin. It is an altcoin with virtually no users and every altcoin without many users has low fees and fast confirmation times.",1524181188

"my best guess: its probably the best way to link BTC accounts to names, and for the gov to see whos not paying taxes",1524181038
"You should avoid Coinbase.  I've heard nothing but horror stories about their customer service.  Also their fees are astronomically high (I'm in MN, which unfortunately means we can't access or use GDAX - the exchange tied to Coinbase).  Check out Binance, they are a good platform for exchanging ETH/BTC for other coins.  I used Gemini to purchase my ETH/BTC, but I know their fees went up a bit recently too (still better than coinbase).  By 5-30m he means that's the market cap for the coin in millions.  I would recommend looking into VEN, LOOM, WTC, ENG, IOTA, and XRP.  Do your homework a little bit and only invest in coins that you truly believe have a bright future.  Avoid trading a ton since it impacts your taxes (look up capital gains tax information if you're curious).  Also if you are putting any significant amount of money in, look into cold storage (I like hardware wallets).  Lastly, read the FAQ, there's tons of info there I'm sure.",1524180904

"&gt; It's not though!

Yes it is. I will explain it.

&gt;  Talk to everyone who offers things that you need

You mean, supermarkets, large-sized retailers? They cannot use Bitcoin. It's simple as that. Every payment needs to issue a selling bill for tax reasons. Failing to do so, can get them into big trouble.

Maybe small retailers, but I don't shop in those because they have nothing I need or because they are more expensive. But even in those, there's the issue of the age.

Shops which are managed by elder people, are a no-go. Where I live, elder people are very distrustful of new-tech. They prefer live-cash. most of those retailers don't even accept debit/credit cards.
This also takes out small groceries local markets, since most of them are also managed by older folks. 

Then there's the distrust in what Bitcoin is. I have found to be very common, for millennials to distrust Cryptocurrencies. They see it more as gambling.

The only thing I'm remembering is online shopping for computer hardware. When Steam was accepting Bitcoin, I wanted to use Bitcoin to buy some games, but the fees... the fees killed me. Too bad Steam doesn't accept Bitcoin anymore. It would help there.",1524180754
"I am aware what a white paper is - I have written many of them myself. I just don't understand the obsession in the crypto space when there are other factors that are MUCH more important. Whitepapers are just words and ideas - you can write anything in them. It doesn't make them true, and it doesn't even make them accurate.

If it's plans, ideas, concepts, how the technology works, etc that is needed - then VeChain has answered quite a lot of that through their AMAs, Apotheosis, and numerous presentations. And given their partnerships and activities, I'd say we are well beyond white paper stage.",1524180750
"1,000 years from now, when people ask, ""who made bitcoin?"", Pieter will be in the first class, along with Satoshi, Hal Finney, and few others.",1524180716
"Makes too much sense. X dollar amount leaves the crypto market for the mostly shit ICO market. Founders of shit ICO's dump on everyone else, losses on original X principal. Rinse. Repeat. Less $ in crypto market. ",1524180707
"I've got two previous predictions on record. In my first, from about a month ago, I predicted, mainly based on a gut feeling, that the market would bottom out around or under $90 billion, and definitely higher than $25 billion. I don't really believe that any more. Or, rather, if the market does that, we're all so screwed that it may not even be worth planning for. 

My second prediction from a couple of weeks ago was based on the percentage correction we saw in the 2013-2015 bear market. If this bear market mirrored that one, we'd be looking at a bottom somewhere around $190 billion. Assuming that this bear market comes and goes 3x faster than the previous one did, we'd be looking at it ending by Q4 of this year.

Ultimately, though I think a lot of it depends on whether several looming crises in crypto actually erupt. The most serious of these is Tether, which is acting like a 19th century wildcat bank. Either it's going to be revealed that Tether doesn't have $2 billion in a vault somewhere, causing a run on the bank, or Tether will come under serious regulatory scrutiny, hampering its ability to continue operating. Both of those things could happen in tandem, too.",1524180658
"I know its obviously history, but I had fun seeing the CMC API page has aged quite nicely:

https://coinmarketcap.com/api/

BTC at 500 USD, ETH at 10 USD.

HODL and Spend my cryptofriends. Do not waste your efforts on day trading and tethering.",1524180657
"Cc fees around 3%
Crypto fees around 0.x%

And crypto is obv way faster ",1524180622
"Plenty would slip through the net, but enough would be caught at random to make some people afraid to use it, and those that still wanted to would be forced into doing it in the shadows, which would make yet more people wary. Realistically governments can't shut down crypto 100%, but they could shit on it hard enough to ruin it anyway.

"Let me know what you think about that:
An 25-something years old asked me, to explain Bitcoin to him as short as possible.
I: You know Gold, right?
H: yes.
I: You remember downloading from decentralized Torrents, many peer-to-peer connections to get your File together and how fucked the whole global Content-Industry was, because there was no way to stop it?
H: Yes
I: well, now Torrents and Gold had something like Gangbang with some Genius and some Cryptography joining in, and the result was a wonderful thing, called Bitcoin.
H: and? what does that mean?
I: So, we're on par, that Torrents were unstoppable, and Industry adapted.
Gold is some fun stuff. But doesn't fit in your cellphone or through a fiber cable, right? What do you think a hard to get (mine) and unfakeable, but easily and globally transferable ""thing"" could add to that thing, that disrupted the way we communicate or consume content, or order stuff? You know, the Internet?
H: well...woah.",1524180573
Visa and Mastercard apparently limit chargebacks to 1% of your sales. This is not really a problem that bitcoin would solve for almost any business.,1524180510
"White paper is the document where you describe how something works and on what principles it is based. The term was first mentioned by Winston Churchil in 1922 and is used to persuade customers or partners, proclaiming an unalterable principle, viewpoint or policy. Most cryptos start with a whitepaper, so we can know the technical details, roadmap in some degree and what, how, and why they are doing what they are doing. Its the first thing i check when investing in a new crypto.",1524180495

"&gt; The NYA/SegWit2x was cancelled because there was no consensus for the hard fork

the NYA/Segwit2x was called off **after** the first half of it had activated ie Segwit on the main chain.

the fact that it was called off half way through does not invalidate the fact that it is still the reason why you have Segwit on manchain now!

hence the bait and switch


I know you know this but I will spell it out for you and others who might not


&gt; the timeline


* pre NYA Segwit signalling for activation maxed out at about 40% prob being generous here

* and therefor would never of activated on the main chain, with its own activation mechanism (needed ~95% i think)

* enter your mate Shaolin Fry with his UASF node code which on a certain date would not accept non Segwit blocks hence forking the chain

* UASF nodes **never got above 5%** and absolutely no economically important nodes (exchanges bitpay etc) were in among this 5% ie **no one would notice if they forked off onto their own network** even assuming they had a miner

&gt; could UASF gained enough momentum? maybe but we will never know, though considering after nearly a year of Segwit signalling it barely got above 40% probably not.

* enter NYA  activate Segwit, then a couple of months later fork and increase the blocks

* **Segwit signalling goes to 99% overnight**

* Bitcoin Cash is created to preserve a pre Segwit chain and a hedge against bait and switch tactics ala [HKA](https://www.ccn.com/developers-unilaterally-tore-agreement-says-bitcoin-miner/)

* Segwit is activated on main chain

* anti hard fork propaganda goes into overdrive

* exchanges and merchants who probably only wanted Segwit ( presumably they believed the fud about forking ) dropped out once they had got what they wanted. causing a cascade 

* many stayed strong but the damage had been done

* hard fork is called off, as there is deemed not enough consensus




",1524180159
"There was once a legitimate discussion to be had about the trade-offs involved in increasing block size as bitcoin was approaching its block size limit.

It quickly turned into a embarrassing shitshow. 

But one way or the other, irreconcilable differences in technological consensus were resolved the only way you can do it in crypto: the coin forks and the market/community/ecosystem decides what's worth what.",1524180157
Amazon would no doubt sell the data to governments and from there they could easy have a list of everyone's names and Bitcoin addresses. Lol fuck that I'm not paying with crypto on that site when or if they accept it.,1524180080

"Definitely not BCH. You'd have to buy BCH, send to binance or bittrex. Change to Eth or BTC. Then to Ada or IOTA. Eth is a better choice as it's a pairing. Extra step with extra fees for BCH.",1524180008
"&gt;Amazon could use this for the betterment of crypto

They wouldn't unless it gives them a lot of profits and advantages.",1524179989
"I also believe crypto is going to have the largest market cap in the world. Nothing can compete with a market where there are coins with a fixed supply that are in high demand. You can put 10 of the best coins on a dart board, throw a dart and all in on whatever coin the dart lands on and be set for like in 1-3 years depending on how much money you put in. Not everyone needs to jump in on WTC like it's the only coin going to bring us to the promise land. ",1524179983
"it's not so much placing pictures, but placing 0's and 1's in such a sequence that if you were to interpret it with one of popular image formats it would come up with a picture of child abuse, this is possible in bitcoin because you can add a message to your transaction",1524179979
"You should have bought eth, not btc.",1524179892
"&gt; pay 30$ for each transaction for bitcoin

Transfers aren't even close to that, lol.  But this sub hates btc, which is the backbone of things.  So you trade into Tether or USDT, but you can't get real greenback until you transfer to a common crypto that you CAN, like BTC.


These pairs sound more like places to store your wealth while they make money off your wealth.  Sounds like bloomberg, which has been pounding the market with negative stories lately.

",1524179890
"**Merchant acceptance is NOT the problem.**

You would be hard pressed to find a merchant that says ""I *prefer* to pay thousands in fees and lose thousands to chargebacks!""

Super low fees and irreversible payments?  I'm a merchant that does $5M/yr and pays thousands in fees and chargebacks monthly, I'd take that in a heartbeat!

The problems that are preventing merchant acceptance, which is why verge had to PAY mindgeek to sign on:

1. Very low consumer adoption.  If you offer to accept crypto, it will be like 0.001% of your revenue.  Its hardly worth the time of integrating into your POS/Website.

2. Very little benefit to consumers over existing payment methods, causing #1.

3. Too many hurdles to obtain and pay with crypto, causing #1

4. Too much risk of theft by hackers, causing #1

5. High volatility, causing #1

I should mention #4 and #5 are big problems for merchants as well.  If the price were stable, and if banks could hold and insure your crypto against theft like they do with the FDIC backing cash deposits, that would solve the only problems merchants have besides consumer adoption.  It might solve the problem for banks as well, what would they care if they're taking cash or crypto deposit?",1524179882
"There are many block explorers out there, but the best one right now ATM that I know of is www.smartbit.com.au.

They have correctly implemented segwit, so you can search bech32 addresses and the fee size on transactions is shown correctly.

Also unlike blockchain.info and blocktrail.com (bought by bitmain), they're not pushing bullshit forks of bitcoin.

They also have charts, although not quite as many as blockchain.info.",1524179880
unfortunately lots of people on this sub reddit were doing the exact same thing when BTC was at the all time high.  I'm just amazed a lender would actually suggest it in advertising when most banks are trying to block crypto transactions.  I know Cash Call is a glorified loan shark but still,1524179872
"In its current form, it makes no sense to hold BTC. There's the argument that they could at any time increase the block size like BCH did. But in my opinion they won't, because Blockstream's mission is to kill or at least stop or slow down Bitcoin. If in order to kill Bitcoin Cash they need to increase the block size, they will have already failed, because BTC will work again. Besides, there's this cancer called Segwit, that can't be rolled back, so even if they increase the block size, a big part of the network is already ruined. That's why Bitcoin Cash forked exactly before Core began using Segwit.

If you have doubts about this you can always keep a ""hedge"". You can keep a small percentage of your holdings in BTC, just in case. BTC could still go up in price irrationally, as most people are quite uninformed. Personally, I don't like betting on irrationality. I mean I could also win at the casino, but it wouldn't be a safe bet. With Bitcoin \(BCH\), I know price might fluctuate wildly during the year. But over the years, it will go up a lot. Especially since it's so low right now, and adoption is growing really fast.

I don't know at which point the mainstream media will call BCH Bitcoin. The media is controlled by the same people that funded Blockstream, so who knows. Personally, as long as BCH continues going up over the years, and works as intended, I don't care. People can accumulate BTC if they want, but I don't want to accumulate a coin that I might not be able to spend when needed. Last year I spent fees of up to $100 to get out of that shitcoin. A friend of mine who is a trader even had a transaction ""come back"" to him. It was a huge transaction, so imagine his customer's panic. But he's honest so he sent the coins again. When volume goes up, BTC becomes completely unreliable.",1524179860
"as far as I've heard, CIBC is one of the last banks to not be very crypto-adverse. you should be fine.",1524179849
"Bitcoin would have been cheaper and faster.  But I'm incredulous.  I have sent many wire transfers, and I have never paid less than $50 even for amounts in the thousands.

Plus, fuck banks. We don't need them anymore, not for moving our own damn money around, anyway.  The smart ones are probably figuring out how to adapt to the new economy wherein dollars will only be used for paying taxes and will be largely shunned.  Yeah, that's right: in five years, your latte will cost $100 or .0000001 BTC.",1524179848
Cant use my mastercard to buy btc on coinbase. Fuck them,1524179843
The McAfee cock-o-meter is by far the best way to follow the price of BTC. ,1524179813
What is the big deal with transaction fees preventing adoption? All credit card transactions have fees and the store you're using pays those fees. What's the difference between paying those credit card fees and paying a cyrpto transaction fee?  Wouldn't a  store in theory take on the crypto fees like they already do for credit cards? ,1524179794

"Why are big banks and corporations like Amazon, Apple, Walmart etc going to adopt an open source decentralized crypto when they have the resources to write their own and control it?  This is a roadblock to widespread adoption of crypto.  I fully believe the technology is going to be widely adopted but I think big companies will want to centralize and control it because they can.  

I also don't think Chase, Citi, Bank of America, Amazon, Google etc will make inferior products because they probably have as much or more resources and software dev experience then all of the current crypto projects combined.  These big banks and retail companies want to use the blockchain technology because it will make their businesses faster and more efficient but obviously they want to control it.  And even though it sucks, the reality is that I imagine the vast majority of people who want to use crypto for utility not as an investment will be more then happy to use ones issued by companies that they trust and that will push adoption of the tech.

I'm fucking tired really of having to justify Bitcoin's existence and whether people uses it for good or bad.
Bitcoin, just like the Internet or cash is a tool and people chooses to use it in a good or a bad way. What we need to go after is the terrorists and criminals, not anything they touch be it a truck, a knife, the Internet or Bitcoin.
I will go even further: we are in those kind of debates because we live in a society where the discussion is on ""what next to regulate or forbid"" where we accept that it is acceptable for the Government to regulate every aspect of our life and treat us like children.

"Fuck, I lost a full reply like an idiot. Summary:

None of these companies are monopolies per se. Internet companies more or less have formed an oligopoly. Wal Mart is something you or I might agree is a monopoly and yet they are more like Facebook and Google in the fact that they offer a wide variety of products and are thus hard to pin down as having cornered an entire market. Tell that to the individual markets that have been affected however.

My main point though is that we not hail Google, Amazon and Facebook as paragons of excellence and virtue simply because on the surface they appear to share our values. There is obfuscation at hand.

Here are some good articles that are out of the mainstream lexicon but objective enough to warrant a good look through. 

https://mic.com/articles/85101/10-corporations-receiving-massive-public-subsidies-from-taxpayers#.TSkWtH8xb

Google takes in more money from subsidies in 2014 than Wal Mart and Disney combined. So in one instance, they are ‚Äústanding up for our rights‚Äù while in another instance, they are depriving us of those rights. Don't look at the left hand, only the right. We want to save you money while we take your money!

It turns out these companies, and all companies, and all people tend to care about self-preservation. The next article may illuminate that self-preservation in action and what Google has to gain in the NN debate. It is dated all the way back from 2010.

https://www.siliconvalleywatcher.com/googles-billions-in-internet-subsidies/

""- Google is lobbying the FCC over what broadband providers can charge consumers because it takes attention away from its own massive use of Internet bandwidth.

Google's massive hidden implicit subsidy in the FCC's proposed open Internet regulations is that it is acceptable for broadband providers to charge consumers more for faster service, but it is unacceptable for broadband providers to charge web companies like Google more for more speed.

He makes the point:

Why should a consumer have to pay more for more broadband speed and capacity, but Google should not?‚Ä¶‚Äù

Amazon is another leech on the taxpayer. You and I have the choice to reject the internet companies if we so wish. In a free-r market, we might even have better choices--I could almost guarantee it. But for some reason, we can't object to subsidizing a company whose CEO is quite literally the richest man in the world. Wouldn't you, at the very least, not like to subsidize the richest person in the world? I remember there being a thing about people in this country disapproving of the 1%.

And yet...

and...

Ironically enough, the USPS is also a leech and if not propped up by tax subsidies it would have long died off. USPS is nothing more than Nationalism. I‚Äôll take FedEx anyway of the week!

Finally, and more relevant to cryptocurrency,  I literally saw this today in r/bitcoin:

"&gt; What is going to stop them from enforcing taxes on bitcoin that scale with USD inflation? Once that happens, doesn‚Äôt btc become useless?

Nothing and depends.

""inflation = tax"" is the dumbest argument for crypto for the reasons you pointed out. government can just increase taxes on literally anything else to compensate, so you aren't reducing the tax burden you're just shifting it to somewhere else, and its not necessarily going to be shifted to a better place than taking a tiny bit of value from everyones dollars, which has very negligible effect unless you're holding a large amount of dollars over a long period of time not invested in any kind of returns, which is not a good thing for a currency anyway.

A bigger core issue is that Proof of Work is a fundamentally inefficient way of securing a network. The bigger the value of the network the more inefficient transactions have to be to stop it being more profitable to break the network than to secure it. 

People are overly focused on tokens for trade not being ""devalued"" whilst ignoring they're supporting a system that is going to waste real value (not just a token for value), by depending on an energy-computing arms race to make sure no one can take 51% of the network.

If the justification of Proof of Work is to avoid ""inflation tax"" then its utterly doomed to fail because you're not avoiding tax you're just switching to a form of money that now wastes huge amounts of resources to stop anyone from compromising it.

Zero chance lightning can become a world-payment system with everyone running their own lightning node.

The only, only way it can work as a global payment system is via a hub and spoke model in which ordinary people give money to companies that run lightning nodes and manage their account for them.

Which will be the death of trustlessness, which will require AML/KYC laws, since these companies WILL be custodians of the funds of the people they manage money for, and it's quite likely that the entry point for Lightning will be banks and similar institutions. You'll have a savings account and a Lightning account with your bank, you can fund back and forth. Lightning will essentially replace the checking account at banks.

Setting aside ‚Äúselfish mining‚Äù imagine thee are only two mining pools one with 0 &lt; a &lt; 1 hashrate

The other naturally has 1 - a

You can generate the expected block interval for each miner by creating a series of random numbers that are exponentially distributed, for some given period of time.

Pool 1 finds on average every 10/a minutes.
Pool 2 finds on average every 10/(1-a) minutes.

They are independent processes. The miners will find blocks in this fashion regardless of whether the other finds a block, or published a block, or orphans previous blocks. 

If you were to then consider both pools as being honest miners then analyse the interval data you find that the sum total of blocks found works out about 1 every 10 minutes, as expected.

The number of blocks found by each pool corresponds to their hashrate.

Those block intervals have a different mean, and by virtue of being exponential distributed different standard deviations.

So the suggestion that you can model ‚Äúwho found the next block‚Äù as a simple random variable doesn‚Äôt make sense to me, as this does not take into account the respective variance in intervals.

To demonstrate this you can take those generated block intervals and use them as the means to decide who mined the next block in the SM simulation. (Instead of just randomly assigning based on hashrate)

You get different results on where the threshold for profitability.

"It requires insane computing power to send a ""Shielded"" transaction. Your average cellphone and even some laptops and computers literally cannot send a private transaction with Bitcoin private.

As a result, no one uses them. I don't mean most people, I mean no one. No exchange, 3rd party wallet, hardware ledger, store or payment gateway will ever use BTCP's privacy mechanism.

And you might say well okay that's great, but as computers get better more people will start using them, right?

But the issue is that it's a completely different implementation, so now BTCP has to go back to every place that accepted it and ask them to change how their entire system works just so they can have shielded transactions.

ON TOP of all that, BTCP uses a trusted setup based system so it's more of like ""You can't see what's going on but I can"" type thing - which is kind of how banks work. I can't see your banking history but your bank can.

To make things worse, the CEO of Zcash (the coin ZCL is based on that BTCP is based on) basically admitted that Zk-snarks are ""private enough for most transactions"" but not private enough for criminals. If it's not private enough for criminals, it's not private enough for you.

"You would think BCH supports would just focus on how to enhance the BCH blockchain instead of really even caring about BTC.  I don't really understand the point??

The bottom line is that nobody really knows the future role of Bitcoin (or BCH or any other crypto). All that we know is that Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency to build a sustainable blockchain that has lasted for 9+ years. Building upon that secure network seems super valuable to which is why I believe that blockchain (and not the copied BCH blockchain) will become a new standard for global money.

The truly interesting aspect about this whole project is that ""Bitcoin"" in and of itself is still just a protocol layer looking to be built upon. This is what is so interesting to me and many other engineers out there. Bitcoin has created a new form of money that can be programmed and built upon, essentially giving inner-apps intrinsic value to function. This is amazing! To simply say it is 'cash' is incorrect as it drastically simplifies what Bitcoin is and can be.

Why can't BTC and BCH live in harmony? The answer is, they probably can but time will tell. Imo, BCH has to drastically shift its marketing tactics as it is currently quite the pariah in the crypto-community. Why not shift and become a stand alone project and stop comparing itself to Bitcoin and marketing it as 'the real Bitcoin'. All of that nonsense hurts this project and makes its supporters look foolish.

Take the time to look at BCH as what it is, a completely separate project that has a larger blocksize than Bitcoin. It is NOT Bitcoin, it is Bitcoin Cash. Delineate these projects properly and finally you will be on a path to possible success. Constantly compete with Bitcoin and choose to market the BCH brand as ""Bitcoin"", and that will just lead to the eventual implosion of this project.

If you introduce a change to the network that users can either embrace or ignore, it is an opt-in soft fork.

Honestly, in my opinion the only coins I can say with any degree of certainty will still be here in 5 years are Bitcoin and Ethereum. Now, I love to speculate on all manner of alts, but when I'm looking for a safe place to park money long term, a proven slow mover is just right.",1524174165

"&gt; So far, little has changed to fix the fundamental problem.

Little has changed??  Are you serious?

Since the last time we had massive fees and huge mempool here is what has changed.

* Segwit adoption has dramatically increased; more wallets, exchanges, users, all support it. Including, finally, Coinbase.
* Transaction batching by exchanges has dramatically increased, making much more efficient use of the blockspace available.
* Millions and millions of UTXOs have been consolidated.
* The lightning network has been deployed on mainnet.  And while it's not offloading any significant number of transactions at this time, it is still a major technological achievement that shows the way forward will work.
* RSK launched, and while few people seem to notice or pay attention, the fact that there are functional sidechains is still a pretty big deal.

With these changes the mempool backlog we saw back in December, would have been completely cleared today.

So, enough with this 'nothing has changed' narrative.

The community learned that the blockchain is a valuable resource and they are now acting as a better steward, by not abusing it with inefficient practices.

Also, and I don't think enough people recognize this enough, the fact that people were willing to pay massive fees during that time, *as painful as it was*, is nevertheless also an incredibly positive development too.

It showed that sending bitcoin was **so valuable** to people that they were willing to pay very high fees.  Fees so high that the fees themselves were beginning to compete with the coinbase subsidy.

Why is this so important?  Because the plan of record for bitcoin is that fees need to begin replacing the block-reward subsidy, which is decreasing far more rapidly than most people realize.  This isn't something to 'worry about in a 100 years' but something that will be happening rapidly over the next 20 years.  The block-reward decreases **exponentially** and will be going down to a minuscule amount far faster than most people realize.

The fact that, for a period of time, the fees were actually capable of compensating miners, and that people were willing to pay those high fees, is a remarkable event in the history of bitcoin!",1524173722

I really don't see the case for the merchant being protected from double spends just because he sees the transaction first.  In fact, I see it as even more likely to BE a double spend.

A customer sends two transactions at the same time - the invalid (or double-spend) transaction is sent directly to a known miner.  The merchant receives the other transaction and takes some bit of time to validate and retransmit.  Is the merchant already fooled at this point since he has seen a transaction that has proper format, signatures, and fees - thus assuming the transaction he sees will be accepted by the network?  Or does he wait long enough to request confirmation from other nodes or a miner on the network - in which case, why bother receiving the transaction except to provide an internet connection for the customer*?

* This option to provide rebroadcast of the transaction could be totally valid in the case where the customer does not have a network connection.  If that is the only intent, I think the wording should be much more explicit there...not ""10% is where you need internet to avoid a double-spend"".",1524172935

My local coffee stall doesn't want to have a smartphone or a tablet perched on their countertop (or velcro'd to the wall, as it used to be before BTC stopped working for coffee). So what I'm trying to find for them is a POS terminal with a decent form factor. 

The best examples I have found are two-screen devices like [this](http://www.tousei.com.cn/android-terminal/pt-7003.html), [this](https://www.zkc-pda.com/zkc900-intelligent-pos-terminal-3g.html) or [this](http://www.cynovo.com/en/). They can easily display a QR code on the customer facing screen and they have NFC, a receipt printer and a nice cradle to dock in and charge from.

Now don't go thinking you can have one of these things accepting both crypto **and** credit cards, because any terminal that can take credit cards must be approved by EMV (Europay Mastercard Visa) through their PCI (Payment Card Industry) initiative, and why would they allow that. Just ask [Poynt](https://poynt.com/) who openly admit in their developer documentation that you can't do anything interesting with the second screen because EMV won't let them let you. So stay away from anything ""EMV/PCI/PTS approved"".

This resistance to coexistence could be useful to our cause in a way. Those devices I linked to have a primary touch screen the size of a small tablet, big enough for a whole Android POS application, so goodbye old fashioned till or PC-sized POS, this is all you need. And you can display a nice summary with a total amount on the second screen for the customer, with options to pay by crypto or credit card. And since EMV won't let you take cards on this device, you just place one of those ugly little Ingenico / Verifone / PDQ devices next to it for the customer that wants to pay by card.

Now the merchant and customer have this great, clean, modern experience on a next-generation device for POS and seamlessly integrated crypto payments. And EMV is the ugly old cousin on the side with the same old crappy experience for card payments. Who's in the driver seat now?",1524172756

Nah I don't think the price can be predicted short\-term. A successful upgrade might generate a cycle of euphoria, good news, and a jump, but no one can assure you such thing. Long\-term it's definitely going to the moon, since it's the real Bitcoin \(BCH follows the original design, scaling plan, and blockchain\). For years I believed it can go to 100,000 or even 1,000,000 USD, and I still believe it. In fact, Bitcoin \(BCH\) is the only coin that has survived a hostile takeover by banks. In 2016 and 2017 I was really worried because Blockstream/Core kept refusing to upgrade the 1mb limit that was crippling the entire network and economy. But now that it escaped the blockade as BCH, I see it's truly unstoppable. If someone tries to take over by buying its devs, censoring its forums, etc, like Blockstream did, Bitcoin will simply fork away and continue doing its thing.

The fact that most people still are in the shadows about all what happened, and many still believe BTC is the good old Bitcoin \(it's not, since it killed its use as cash by keeping the 1mb limit and implementing RBF, Segwit, etc\), makes BCH even a better investment opportunity, because its price is a fraction of what it should be.",1524172574

While there is only 1 reference client for Bitcoin ; there are many more non-reference clients (and teams maintaining them) than for BCH. This can be seen just by looking at the diversity of nodes for BTC/BCH.

As for ""Distribution"" this is a bit harder to determine. 

Since BCH and BTC have the same genesis block we would expect the coin with greater distribution to have greater ""Coin Days Destroyed"". There would be less older coins moving on the less distributed Coin ; since anyone who wanted to dump coins after the fork would have likely already done so. 

If the coins were dumped from from one chain to the other; then the chain that was ""dumped"" (in net) would have ""newer"" coins since they'd have moved at the time of the fork. With that reasoning we would expect in general that CDD will be greater with the more distributed coin; since there are more older coins to move around.

Chartism was a working-class movement for political reform in Britain that existed from 1838 to 1857. It took its name from the People's Charter of 1838 and was a national protest movement, with particular strongholds of support in Northern England, the East Midlands, the Staffordshire Potteries, the Black Country, and the South Wales Valleys. Support for the movement was at its highest in 1839, 1842, and 1848, when petitions signed by millions of working people were presented to the House of Commons. The strategy employed was to use the scale of support which these petitions and the accompanying mass meetings demonstrated to put pressure on politicians to concede manhood suffrage.

All that we know is that Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency to build a sustainable blockchain that has lasted for 9+ years.  Building upon that secure network seems super valuable to which is why I believe that blockchain (and not the copied BCH blockchain) will become a new standard for global money.

The truly interesting aspect about this whole project is that ""Bitcoin"" in and of itself is still just a protocol layer looking to be built upon.  This is what is so interesting to me and many other engineers out there.  Bitcoin has created a new form of money that can be programmed and built upon, essentially giving inner-apps intrinsic value to function.  This is amazing!  To simply say it is 'cash' is incorrect as it drastically simplifies what Bitcoin is and can be.

Why can't BTC and BCH live in harmony?  The answer is, they probably can but time will tell.  Imo, BCH has to drastically shift its marketing tactics as it is currently quite the pariah in the crypto-community.  Why not shift and become a stand alone project and stop comparing itself to Bitcoin and marketing it as 'the real Bitcoin'.  All of that nonsense hurts this project and makes its supporters look foolish.

Take the time to look at BCH as what it is, a completely separate project that has a larger blocksize than Bitcoin.  It is NOT Bitcoin, it is Bitcoin Cash.  Delineate these projects properly and finally you will be on a path to possible success.  Constantly compete with Bitcoin and choose to market the BCH brand as ""Bitcoin"", and that will just lead to the eventual implosion of this project.

"&gt; Most miners run ABC ... When the miner receives the transaction, he will then broadcast it to all the nodes he's connected to.

You cannot rely on anonymous volunteers (including miners) doing something only because it is good for the Cause.  That is the very premise of the bitcoin protocol, and the reason why the problem of decentralized payment system remained open for 15 years.  

From SMTP to BitTorrent, decentralized systems had been built from such ""well-meaning volunteers"" (WMVs).  Everybody who tried to design a decentralized payment system assumed unconsciously that it would be operated by WMVs too.  But that did not work, because the stakes for fraud were much higher, and it was impossible to assume that a majority of the anonymous volunteers would be well-meaning.. 

Satoshi's bright idea was precisely to dispense with the WMVs and instead build the network from ""selfish greedy bastards"" (SGBs), whose only goal would be to grab the reward of the next block.  The security of the bitcoin network depends critically on the assumption  that a majority of of the miners will be SGBs.  This assumption is not at all certain (and in fact is not valid today), but was plausible enough to make the scheme worth trying.  

The cypherpunks, who appropriated the system after Satoshi left, never understood this fact, or did not accept it.  They could not accept the idea that ""their"" payment system, which would be the foundation of their utopia, would be run by greedy entrepreneurs who did not care about their Cause.  

Thus the cypherpunks changed Satoshi's design to include a layer of WMVs -- the relay network -- between the miners and users; and told themselves that those volunteers would be the true masters of the network, who would check the work of the miners and keep them honest.  To reinforce that new dogma, they even redefined the word ""node"", which for Satoshi meant ""miner"", to mean ""non-mining server that accepts your transactions and maybe does something else that you expect it to do, maybe not"".

But obviously those relay nodes are much worse than useless.  They don't contribute anything to the network's security.  On the contrary, they completely break it.  While they cannot change the blocks that miners produce, they can censor client transactions and serve a minority branch instead of the majority one -- which is what the the UASF golpistas intended to do. Then the basic bitcoin rule ""trust the longest valid branch that you know"" no longer yields the (already weak) security guarantees that Satoshi proved from the critical hypothesis above. 

The addition of the relay network to Satoshi's design was like a bank accepting the services of a bunch of self-appointed anonymous volunteers security guards in ninja costumes, and letting them ferry papers and cash between the clients and cashiers.  Technically, it was like a guy disliking the idea of combustion engine and thus having his automobile pulled by a horse instead. 

The miners have no financial incentive for forwarding to non-mining nodes the transactions that they receive; but have small a financial *dis*incentive -- the processing and bandwidth cost.  

Miners have a weak incentive to forward the transactions to other **miners**, because of the way the FIBRE protocol works; but they may also have a *dis*incentive to do so, because of the transaction fees.  Namely, if you have 5% of the hashpower and receive a tx with $1.00 fee, your expected revenue from that tx is only $0.05 if you forward it to most miners, but (say) $0.20 if you do not forward and only 15% of the other miners get that tx through other means.

The system cannot depend on the assumption that miners would abide by a specific implementation or policy that has no financial motivation -- such as forwarding any txs that they receive to some non-mining relays -- just ""for the good of the Cause"".  That would mean assuming that every miner hosts, in addition to an SGB that does the mining proper, also a WMV who cooperates with the non-mining relay network -- a *honest* WMV. 

And, again, any decentralized solution that solves the double-spending problem for 0-conf transactions would be a decentralized payment system that runs entirely on WMVs, without mining and the blockchain.  That is what scientists and cypherpunks have been trying to build since the early 1190s -- so far with no success.  

You may be able to do that by having a single ""double spend detection service"", but that would be just a centralized payment system.  And even then I don't see how you can ensure that the transactions that the central service approves will be the ones that the miners will confirm.

Maybe there is a more fundamental misunderstanding going on.  For Satoshi, as for computer scientists and responsible software professionals, a system can be considered secure only if it can be **proved** to be secure.  One can make *explicit* assumptions (like that mining power is dispersed among thousands of independent miners, as Satoshi did), and only give a  small upper bound to the probability of failure (as Satoshi did).  But **there has to be a mathematical proof**.  Then others can decide whether they can trust the system, depending only on whether they trust the assumptions.

Well, it seems that most developers who followed Satoshi do not share that view of ""security"", and may not even understand it. It seems that they think it is enough for them to state that some undesired things ""are unlikely to occur in practice"" -- even when there is no logical argument or empirical evidence to back such claims.  Like:

+ ""It is unlikely that the relays nodes that you contact are all malicious""

+ ""It is unlikely that three pools will conspire to do something that holders/traders/users don't like""

+ ""It is unlikely that miners will stay with pools that try to take advantage of their size""

+ ""It is unlikely that miners will fail to honor their blockchain votes about a soft fork""

And so on.  And also

+ ""It is unlikely that a miner will confirm a transaction that was not seen by the 0-conf validation service""",1524169351

This is a simplification, but that's basically how it goes.

&gt;Well, IP Addresses falling under GDPR seems a bit silly, I think MAC Addresses are a far better choice to bring under GDPR

Both of them fall under the same. For IP address you of course need the address and time. For MAC just the address itself is pretty permanent unless intentionally changed.

You mention Satoshi's white paper (for some reason), but in reality, back during the Bitcoin list-serv, Satoshi admitted that micro spending would likely still be a concern.  Was this something you just did not know or did you have another interpretation that lead you to believe the intention was to transfer ANY amount easily?  It was never an original intention as instead, it was an original obstacle known to be addressed at some point.  But the initial version of Bitcoin did not address it.

&gt;Bitcoin isn't currently practical for very small micropayments. Not for things like pay per search or per page view without an aggregating mechanism, not things needing to pay less than 0.01. The dust spam limit is a first try at intentionally trying to prevent overly small micropayments like that.

"\#2.

Adding another channel requires additional liquidity in the form of on-chain Bitcoins. Without those available, the only answer is the close-and-reopen.

\#3.

You do not need a Bitcoin wallet to receive Bitcoin. You simply need a private key and a generated address. No interaction is required beyond supplying the address. No connectivity is required.

\#4.

This is like ""locking"" your money in a checking account, too. Think twice before you dismiss the analogy as ludicrous - every new ""lock"" requires a fee.

\#5.

Oh, you can route the money in a circle - once again, at the cost of two transaction fees and requirement of external liquidity.

\#10.

Lightning is closer to IOU's than 0-conf because they are unbroadcast transactions. They're effectively digital IOU's - the action of broadcasting (i.e. closing the channel) is the action of redeeming it. Remember that physical dollars are actually IOU's, too - the action of spending a dollar is the action of redeeming the debt it represents.

\#11.

This deserves to be hit back hard, because it's so wrong.

* Current topology doesn't matter when speaking of scaled futures

* Current bank money-making methods don't matter when speaking of a bank takeover

&gt; The whole reason banks enjoy enormous power, is because they have custodial control of everyone‚Äôs funds, and customers have no way to enforce the agreement with the bank.

Wrong. The whole reason banks enjoy enormous power is because they have custodial control of funds *and can use them as collateral for loans*. When you can explain why a financial service that shares control of large sums of consumer funds in Lightning channels *cannot* use that shared control of funds as collateral for a loan, then your argument will have merit.

&gt; Banks can loan your money out without your knowledge.

They typically don't because that isn't profitable. They instead take loans *against* your money.

&gt;  According to new laws passed both in the US and across the EU during the 2008 financial crisis, all customers are now ‚Äúcreditors‚Äù to the banks,

We always *were* creditors. This just galvanized it into law.

&gt; The Lightning network strips all of this power away from them.

**HOW?!** They can still do all the borrow-and-replace shenanigans they were doing before - you know, the speculative borrowing that led to the global financial crisis?

&gt; The lightning protocol fully neuters them from any kind of fractional reserve 

**NO. IT. DOES. NOT.** Cooperative participants can reserve (and thus, fractionally reserve) against any asset they want to. If a lender will accept an unpublished song script as collateral, than that unpublished song is reserved into debt. If the lender offers five times the perceived price of that song, then the song is fractionally reserved.

&gt; completely eliminates the idea of overdraft fees

Lightning channel operators can incur whatever fees they want, and include overdraft fees in the default closure contract.

&gt; It forces the banks to put up real on-chain collateral in order to maintain channels with customers and businesses.

No, it doesn't. You've already explained why in #5.

&gt;  It eliminates practically 99% of the revenue generation model that banks currently use.

... except it absolutely does not in any way eliminate any of the revenue generation models banks currently use *except for the now outdated model of directly lending consumer deposits*. The only problem it solves is one that is not a problem anymore.

&gt;  And they must delay their entry into the industry for 4 or 5 years while they develop a complicated and theoretical cryptographic smart contract network.

(ahem) How long has Lightning been in development? What is the expected total development time, again? 4-5 years? Right.

\#12.

&gt; I mean Bcash is the ‚Äúreal‚Äù Bitcoin after all, amiright?

High-quality slander from a high-quality article, amirite? Give me a break. If I had any confidence in your competence prior to this point, it is gone now.

&gt;  If you somehow wrote the commitment to screw yourself out of coins, you only have yourself to blame.

Well, you and the network of major participants that all refuse to accept commitments that *don't* have a screw-you-out-of-your-money clause. But it's never the industry's fault for pursuing profits, it's the consumer's fault for not providing a competitive service.

\#13.

Your answer to the liquidity freeze attack is channel closure - *which requires paying more fees before being able to complete the transaction*. This means any time-sensitive payment can be prevented arbitrarily by any included channel operator - the victim is forced to await closure confirmation before retrying the transaction, which can render the transaction impossible.

\#15.

Straight up lying in this one. **If you are not online yourself, someone else must be online for you to monitor for attempted fraud. The only way to trustlessly participate in Lightning is full time.** You don't ""have to trust the watchtower"" because you pay them, right? Except *someone else could pay them more*. So your funds, when secured by a paid watchtower, are only as secure as the amount you paid them. If a thief wants to exploit your watchtower, they must simply offer more than what you pay.",1524168653

The three big parts are Interchange fees, Discount fees, and Gateway fees.

**Interchange** is the card network (Visa/Mastercard) and the card issuer.  As a merchant you can't do shit about this one though, unless you are big enough to become a card issuer yourself and can displace many of these with your own card.

**Discount** has nothing to do with discounts, it is the fee your acquirer is charging you.  This is where most merchants get screwed.  

The first thing to know is fee structure.  If you are on a tiered plan, you are almost guaranteed to be getting screwed.  They'll advertise the lowest ""qualified"" rate, but none of your transactions ever end up in there.  The real rate is probably outrageous like 1.76%+$0.15 per transaction.  You most definitely want a cost-plus plan which is a flat rate charged seperately from interchange, rather then bundling them together on your invoice just to keep your more confused.  That flat rate might be like 1%+$0.10 if they're less greedy, but depending on your volume it is possible to push it as low as 0.25%+$0.

The next thing to know, this is all a commission (residual they call it) based industry.  If I sign you up as an agent, I now get 70% of those discount fees.  You are paying me quite a lot of money for someone you'll never speak to again.  I became my own agent to cut this middle man out, and now I get that residual.  Its mostly just my own account, but I help some people out who'd rather not go as far as I did and just want someone who will actually give the lowest possible rate he can give them.

**Gateway** this one is obviously your gateway, like authorize.net.  You might not realize how big this is until you cut your discount fee down and you're doing high volume.   Especially if you solve the whole ""failed AVS leaves a full priced authorization on their card, and the customer tried repeatedly, now they're yelling at you that their card is maxed out with tons of 'charges' from you"" problem by doing a $0 pre-auth first.  Auth.net dings you for those $0 pre-auths too.  I cut my discount fee down to just hundreds a month, my interchange is obviously untouchable so still thousands a month, but my gateway fees were adding up to over $4000 and becoming the largest item on my bill!  

Fuck authorize.net is your answer.  Fuck all the other gateways that follow their lead with basically the same pricing.  USAePay all the way.  There is a $200 signup fee, and you might not have a prebuilt integration available, but both were well worth it when auth.net cost me $4000+ monthly.  The monthly cost is $30 for 5000 transactions, and $10 per block of 5000 transactions beyond that.  $4000 to like $50?  Fuck yea.

That's just a 'quick summary' but you can see for the common merchant that doesn't have the time or bother to take the time to learn payments, they get fucked hard.",1524167991

Maybe in the longer term, 5-10 years out, more people will be using crypto and the ERC20 to ERC20  swaps they're just about to roll out (or any crypto to any other crypto) will be useful - but right now that will only drive adoption within our closed ecosystem of current crypto holders.

I'm not so sure that decoupling most currencies from Bitcoin, or ETH, or BNB, or any of the other ways you can already buy them will change that much.  People think that decoupling will mean that these coins no longer suffer when BTC crashes, but that just doesn't make any sense to me.  If that were true, people would be bailing out of their BTC into these alt-coins when BTC crashes, and when BTC is rising they would jump back into BTC.  Prices don't reflect this happening.

An example would be to look at Binance BTC/REQ and Liqui BTC/REQ. Both are at 2754 sats (at the moment). But if I wanted to buy 0.3 BTC worth at Binance, the max I'd pay is 2755 sats: 



Sats | Coins | BTC (total)
---|----|----
2753 | 363 | 0.00999339
2754 | 7,694 | 0.21189276
2755 | 11,232 | 0.3094416

You'd buy all 363 at 2753, all 7700 at 2754 and most of the coins at 2755, averaging out just over 2754 sats.

But look at Liqui (low volume, not many orders):

Sats | Coins | BTC (total)
---|----|----
0.00002754 | 0.03269843 | 0.0000009
0.00002809 | 18.98770559 | 0.00053426
0.0000281 | 28.8901572 | 0.00134607
0.00002811 | 9.48048176 | 0.00161257
0.00002824 | 172.7860674 | 0.00649205
0.00002852 | 23.12762339 | 0.00715165
0.00002854 | 57.59535579 | 0.00879542
0.00002879 | 23.12907601 | 0.00946131
0.00002888 | 70 | 0.01148291

0.0000292 | 23.12724649 | 0.01383656
0.00002924 | 57.59535579 | 0.01552065
0.00002955 | 10152.28426 | 0.31552065

To buy 0.3 btc worth here, you'd buy all the way from 2754 sats up to 2955, averaging close to 2955 sats. That's a 7.26% difference... or almost  800 REQ less that you'd be getting. 

Volume supports more stable prices and allows people to buy in. Low volume can artificially spike prices (up or down) on a relatively low volume (in this case a 7% difference from just 2400USD). 

You can choose any pair you want - without volume it's susceptible to this type of volatility. That's why you need the volume in order to support a real value for the coin you're looking at.

It‚Äôs all about how humans interact disregarding the older free market methodology of objective based value. It revealed to us (common sense now) was that value is subjective and that too apply objective rules for things of subjective value is heinous. It also considers the producer the consumer as well, as there is great interrelation between the both.

We needn‚Äôt get into medical research. I think you hearts in the write place, but I believe the reason we have less cures for disease today is less about capitalism and more about monopolization and regulation. 

I also don‚Äôt agree with or understand that producers only invest in things that only have value. Certainly some of our brethren sank on the tron ship by jumping in at .32 cents. They will not live another day as it pertains to investing, more or less. Some of us, threw serious money behind projects that we envisioned to have value in the long term that would‚Äôve otherwise been safer in our own pockets. This metaphor is repeated time and time again in the world outside of crypto, of course.

I agree that regulation is important, I just think that we already have great blue prints for how we should protect our citizens and the further we complicate our system of government the further  away we are from knowing exactly what we are trying to preserve to begin with. 

Whew this evolved...

He said though that because they are such a small company with a limited amount of ATM's that he doesn't believe they will be forced to provide personal information any time soon.

"At the end of the day, crypto and decentralization can't solve all of our problems. There are a few ways we could remove reliance from the ISP's, but they are much bigger tasks then preventing the removal of net neutrality laws.

The first would be the de-privatization of network infrastructure. If the Govt owned and maintained the infrastructure instead of the ISP's they would be able to encourage competition. This would come with LOTS of downsides and it is not worth it overall, but it would remove the stranglehold the ISP's currently have.

The second and more likely (although still unlikely) answer is to break up the ISP's. This would require a much larger amount of govt intervention, and would really only be a short term solution - this has happened several times before and yet here we are.

If we can keep net neutrality in place, that changes everything. If all internet is equal, then meshnets are very effective. They will still access the network via ISP's, but the ISP's will not have the ability to interfere with the speed of the meshnet. This is one of many reasons that net neutrality is so important.",1524164823

"No, I don't believe the GPU prices will fluctuate with crypto price or difficulty. I'm saying that I think GPU prices will be based on their hashing performance. It doesn't matter what the difficulty or crypto coin price is at. The performance price for a GTX 1060 should always be around $340 a card. 

For example the last rumored price of GTX 2080 was $1,500. If that price tag matches the performance capability then that card should get around 1,500 sol/s on Equihash. If however the price does not match the performance lets say the card can only do 900 sol/s then the fair price for the GTX 2080 should be $900. 

Each hashing algorithm would have a different ratio of hash/s to dollar. I just use Equihash as the example since it's roughly 1:1 ratio. I would estimate DaggerHashimoto is around 1:14 ratio. 1MH = $14.",1524164636

"My 2 cents - There are two big moves that I think will bring in the masses. 

**Option 1)** I think we won't see the general public really ""get into"" investing in crypto until there is a legitimate crypto index fund provided by institutional investors. Not just investing in crypto businesses - but in crypto coins/tokens themselves. 

I think a lot are still interested (even with the bear market), but even with coinbase or easy fiat pairings - I think they'll shy away until they can just give someone money and say ""Here - put it in!"". They don't want to know about hardware wallets or private keys or cryptography or distributed ledgers. They just want someone to do it for them, even if it comes with a fee. And if we get this coupled with FOMO - watch out. 

**Option 2)** Someone builds a dapp/currency/blockchain that everyone uses without having to realize they are using it. For example - currently everyone pays with their cards, but underneath it all you've got the internet powering that transaction. No one needs to know or care that they are using the internet - it's just there. We need that, but with crypto.

I think both of these are coming and will be the jet fuel once it happens.",1524164182

If FIAT was accepted for more coins and BTC would be out of the picture, since FIAT does not lose value or increase in value as much as BTC, prices might actually be more steady on most crypto and the ones that would go up would mostly be because people actually are more interested on that coin/token

"The less liquidity there is, the less likely it is that you can execute a buy/sell at market price. USD BTC is very liquid, so you won't drive the price up or down very much by buying and selling BTC (Unless you're trading big amounts), but selling even a small amount of an alt coin in low-liquidity markets can move the price up or down - if you sell, you drive the price down, cutting profits as you sell, vice versa with buying. 

Fiat markets for alt coins will have to build an acceptable amount of liquidity before they'll provide a comparable experience with the BTC/ETH markets, and that can definitely take some time. If demand for a coin remains static but more pairs are offered (ie fiat pairs), that static amount of volume is now spread even more thin than before, which is why they might not introduce fiat pairs for the really low volume coins.",1524163732

"Yes. In cost basis computation there are 4 general cases.

1) The trade itself involves USD. One clear way to handle.

2) The trade involves one currency that trades directly with USD. One clear way to handle.

3) The trade involves two currencies that trade directly with USD. Multiple viable methods to handle, can select higher volume currency to establish value or an average between the two.

4) The trade involves no currencies that trade directly with USD. Complicated. The method of favor is to find an intermediate currency that trades with USD and both tokens, compute the exchange between the both tokens and multiple intermediaries, select the intermediary with the lowest spread between the two tokens, take the mean as the ""market value"". For most tokens BTC is the logical choice, but since ETH had lower transaction costs and high volume in 2017 it was usually preferable in scenarios where it was an option. The value of each side of the trade when BTC was used as an intermediary particularly for obscure tokens could be as high as 5-6% even after time averaging over several hours or days for low volume tokens.

"&gt; This is misleading. In the past BTC value in USD was less and you had to pay more fees in BTC in order for your transaction to get mined. Miner fees was reduced as BTC value in USD went up IIRC.

"&gt; This is true, tho. SPV wallets don't carry the entire blockchain so they need to reach out to a 3rd-party server with the entire blockchain to validate the transaction.

From the whitepaper section on SPV:

&gt;**It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node. A user only needs to keep a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain,** which he can get by querying network nodes until he's convinced he has the longest chain, and obtain the Merkle branch linking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in. He can't check the transaction for himself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, **he can see that a network node has accepted it, and blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it.**

&gt;As such, the verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network, but is more vulnerable if the network is overpowered by an attacker. While network nodes can verify transactions for themselves, **the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network.** One strategy to protect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid block, prompting the user's software to download the full block and alerted transactions to confirm the inconsistency. Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to run their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification.

http://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin/#selection-227.4-227.38

This means that SPV can only be fooled by invalid blocks, because the only way to spoof a transaction, whose hash is in the Merkle Tree (which is in the block header), would be to find a collision, which is more improbable than an extinction level event happening in the next 100 years.

So an SPV does verify that your transaction was validated by a miner into ""a"" block, it would just have a hard time determining if its ""the"" valid chain, if there is an attacking miner with majority hashpower (or 33+%, if that's correct). So this isn't really a problem right now as the biggest miner has less than 20% of the hashpower.",1524162424
"I think this makes a lot of sense. 

Personally, I'm not going to make any moves on this theory, even though I believe you're correct.

You may look at Telcoin and think they have 100 billion in total supply, it's nuts but also more than half of that total supply doesn't go to us, it'll be used as an incentive to work with the telecoms, it goes to them.

Don't let the satoshi price fool you, there have been coins such as Verge, Tron, Siacoin, Bytecoin,  and Ripple who've been in Telcoin current price range and some of these coins were even lower priced.

"I think this sub is rather defensive of raising this issue, and rightfully so. The scale of misinformation being spread by bad actors is pretty mind boggling.

That being said, OP has very tastefully raised an issue and is looking for discussion, and we should be respectful back. Here is my opinion:

A block size increase will not allow bitcoin to scale up to any kind of widespread use, unless you increased the blocksize by several orders of magnitude. We could sit around and argue that a 2MB block doesnt cause very much loss of decentralization, but 2MB blocks won't solve the problem. 

20 mb blocks won't solve the problem.

maybe 200 mb blocks would solve the problem, but that creates so many more problems in the end. 

Even with 100% segwit, schnorr, batching, etc, and 20 MB blocks, bitcoin would still not be able to handle the scale of transactions required for widespread adoption.

Therefore, layer 2 (L2) solutions are required. Lightning looks promising. We should continue to develop, test and implement it. L1 will be the strong backbone. L2 will process the majority of transactions in the future.

"**Stockholm syndrome**

Stockholm syndrome is a condition that causes hostages to develop a psychological alliance with their captors as a survival strategy during captivity. These feelings, resulting from a bond formed between captor and captives during intimate time spent together, are generally considered irrational in light of the danger or risk endured by the victims. Generally speaking, Stockholm syndrome consists of ""strong emotional ties that develop between two persons where one person intermittently harasses, beats, threatens, abuses, or intimidates the other."" The FBI's Hostage Barricade Database System shows that roughly eight percent of victims show evidence of Stockholm syndrome.

It was formally named in 1973 when four hostages were taken during a bank robbery in Stockholm, Sweden.

This is arguable depending on your definition of a ""wallet"". I can generate a public/private key pair and receive BTC without ever using a computer, this is simply not possible with a decentralized LN.

* LN can be used at about a dozen merchants, BTC/BCH is accepted by tens of thousands, even Dogecoin is more widely accepted than LN for making payments.

* Claiming the ""UI is better"" is a desperate statement. You can remove all the PoW and transaction verification and build an incredibly slick interface, but there's still no actual value behind it. Knowing the devs are forced to build backend and frontend simultaneously only makes their work harder and their progress slower. All this while they're actively competing against dozens of other cryptos and the legacy banking system.

Obviously the government would be able to subscribe. Why wouldn't they?

&gt; A group of telecommunications providers may subscribe downstream to the combined data stream and be able to correlate the IP (Internet Protocol) addresses of the transactions to countries of origin. Government agencies may be able to subscribe downstream and correlate tax transaction data to help identify transaction participants. 



the entire point of this is to collate bitcoin addresses. if you use bitcoin to buy something and get a shipping address. amazon would store that in a database (no shit) and share that with all of their vendors (also no shit). If you opt in to being identifiable, you will be identified. Amazon is proposing a way to store that.

I mean, blockchain has certain addresses labelled already.


This implies that amazon would be directly taking bitcoin payments, because if they were using a payment processor the coin would not be coming from ""your"" wallet.

A new class of brokerage services!
Start cryptocurrency trading on MT5

Full spectre of services for exchange, trade and investments in cryptocurrencies.

MT5, 1:3 leverage

More and more people become involved in the crypto industry recently. It happens because of high rate of return which exceeds the traditional financial instruments hundreds of times, and as a result the market is constantly growing.
Distinctive features of a crypto brokers if to compare to crypto exchanges:
1. Super modern and powerful MT5 trading terminal, surpassing in convenience, navigation, trading, additional services (there are a lot of robots, applications, social network of MQL5 traders on the market) and speed of any current platform of crypto exchanges.
2. Quotation accuracy and accuracy of the deposit is 8 digits after the decimal point.
3. System of accounting for positions includes both netting and hedging on the trader‚Äôs choice. In netting, all orders for a single instrument have one position, with a hedge each order is a separate item.
4. Millions of traders around the world are already using MT5. You just need to enter a new login, password and IP address of your new broker to get started.
7. The user can choose in which cryptocurrency to nominate the deposit. For example, if the user chose Bitcoin as the deposit currency and bought Bitcoin for a pair of BTC/USD, then, as the cost of Bitcoin increases, the user will receive revenue twice - from the rise in the cost of Bitcoin (since the deposit balance is nominated in Bitcoin) and due to the growth of the pair BTC/USD.
8. Margin trading with a 1:3 leverage allows you to trade for a total of three Bitcoins while having only one Bitcoin on your balance.
9. Trading in crypto assets is available 24/7.",1524158510

Passive rebalancing - injecting fiat to rebalance your holdings - works without the tax dings.

The brigading that occurs if you mention bch negatively in another subreddit for example. 

I check in here every now and again to see what the latest from Ver is, same way people check out what Trumps been up to. From my little visits here, its clear and blatant. I've never seen anything like  it from core or blockstream, in fact I don't think they have ever made such communications.

The most recent is obviously Roger's latest post regarding bribing reddit which was probably sarcastic but the irony was not lost.

"**$8,300: Bitcoin Seeks Direction at Key Price Hurdle**

https://www.coindesk.com/make-or-break-bitcoin-nears-key-resistance-hurdle-at-8300/

Bitcoin (BTC) remains in bullish territory today, but a major break above the long-term descending trendline has been elusive.

That failure on the part of the bulls means the cryptocurrency needs a major move above $8,300 soon to lessen the risks of another sell-off. The trendline resistance is around $8,285 currently.

However, soon before press time, BTC was closing in on that target level and changing hands at $8,226 on Bitfinex (up 1.4 percent on a 24-hour basis). So, the next few hours are likely to determine the pattern going forward.

View

A high-volume break above $8,300 would confirm a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change and open the doors for a move toward $8,800 (10-week MA).

Repeated rejection at the key trendline hurdle would boost the odds of a deeper pullback to $7,510-$7,200.",1524157409

The market cap can grow at least to that of gold and likely further than gold someday. If all crypto equals good then that's 7 trillion or 20x what it is today.

This is the right answer. Most exchanges took the position the name bitcoin is given to the chain with the most work,1524155306
"The address is just the public part of your key pair.  BCH and BTC use the same type of keys,  so your BTC keypair can be used as a BCH keypair too.  Recently BCH changed the way they display the key address to help reduce confusion (cashaddr).",1524155289
"Even better argument. 

Ultimately, the point is though, that currency is to be spent- that‚Äôs the entire philosophy behind it. It is an agreed term that can be used to transfer ownership, regardless of what item the ownership is, even if it‚Äôs just money. All of that being said, the ones who view scalability issues and fees as ‚Äúit was not designed to be a charity‚Äù technically, sure you‚Äôre correct. I don‚Äôt remember reading in the white paper that Bitcoin‚Äôs goal is to be a charity. But it wasn‚Äôt meant to be held onto for dear life, it was designed to be SPENT just like other things we spend our FIAT on, without the trusted parties inbetween. SN didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúbuy bitcoin and hodl foreverzzzz!‚Äù or anything of that nature. Sure, you wanna save some of it? Go for it, people do that with Fiat too, however, it is ultimately to be spent. Whether it‚Äôs a savings for college, retirement, rainy day, or you just wanna save some money, one way or another you‚Äôll spend it eventually somewhere, or give it away. This was never a money making plan, and again although a $100 fee on a million dollar transfer is a bargain, that‚Äôs not the fucking point behind it. I‚Äôd say they need to look outside the box, but they put themselves in that box in the first place and I can‚Äôt see them leaving it anytime soon.

this is why **usage** of Bitcoin is the most important part of Bitcoin (or any crypto for that matter).  just like ETH that has great usage and communities encouraging usage, ETC has the same toxic garbage that the legacy Bitcoin chain has (and no coincidence there) and as we have seen nobody cares about toxic garbage except for the trolls",1524155232

"Stick around, or create a thread asking your questions.  I am sorry I thought you were a troll.  The questions you asked are brought up and discussed constantly  on this sub. I don't have time at the moment to go into details, but I am sure others would be happy to answer your questions in more detail.

Here are some quick answers.

1 - You are correct. Everyone using bch would be terabyte blocks.  Currently, the hardware exists to support this but yes it is expensive and requires data centers.  Also, the bch clients out there need some optimizations to handle blocks that size.  Optimizing the code for larger blocks is the current main focus of the bch dev teams that is not being worked on much by core.

The main important quality for bitcoin separating it from other currencies is censorship resistance. Decentralization is important but is one of several trade-offs. Restricting the blocksize increases decentralization for nodes, but decreases decentralization in other areas. High transaction fees or LN bank hubs are a bigger threat to censorship resistance in my opinion.

Currently, bch is able to handle gigabit blocks which is VISA levels.  Maintaining a node at that blocksize (if blocks are full) costs roughly around $4k / year.  However, not all users need to run nodes. Non-mining nodes don't actually increase the security of the network because they can be sybil attacked and they have no voting power over blocks.  SPV wallets are a secure way to validate the blocks necessary for users.  Businesses involved with bitcoin would want to run nodes and $4k is trivial for them (a lot less than a single minimum wage employee).

Also remember that this 4k is for VISA levels of transactions.  We have a long way to go before getting there and tech will get cheaper with Moore's law.  Moore's law is currently outpacing the growth of cryptocurrency and so long-term there is a chance that hardware costs never become a problem even for terabyte blocks because that will take a long time to reach that level of adoption.

Also, even if Moore's law doesn't keep up, the plan from Satoshi was always to end up with data-centers.  Miner centralization is going to happen automatically to some level with the economics of scale and is happening to btc as well as bch.  However, as long as there is ""enough"" decentralization that one mining cartel doesn't have 51%, than the decentralization is enough.  This is still a concern, but lowering the blocksize doesn't actually address mining centralization at all.  The costs miners have with the block-size is trivial compared to other centralizing pressures such as cheap electricity, etc.

One aspect that is very important to understand is the economic incentives of the ecosystem. A large miner has more to gain from not trying to reach 51% because of the economic incentives of the system.  Gaining 51% to attack teh network goes against miner's economic incentives.  The bigger threat from 51% attacks is not miners but governments.

Finally, transaction malleability is somewhat important for lightning though not necessary because you don't need transaction malleability to make lightning transactions.  Transaction malleability is important though for watchers because malleating a transaction makes it much harder for watchers to monitor the network.  This greatly increases the risks of attack from closing the channels with out-of-date state.

I don't have time to go into detail, but each of these topics is discussed in depth constantly on this sub.",1524155165
"&gt; That's because you're LOSING adoption

This is not so obvious. If you exclude the Oct17-Dec17 period of mad crypto FOMO, which is undeniable, the number of **payments** per day has been fairly constant over the past two years, [see this](https://transactionfee.info/charts/payments/perDay?avg=7&amp;step=false&amp;start=2015-12-30&amp;end=2018-04-17). With oscillations up and down, the current amount of activity is nowhere near out of normal. And if you look at the period in Summer 2015, the nr of payments was also exploding, but that was an anomaly just as late last year was.

Note: This counts the number of payments, not transactions, which is the relevant metric as txs batching decreases the number of txs hitting the blockchain. And the number of payments is calculated as `nPayments = max(1, nOutputs-1) `, to account for the change addresses.

And if you look at the [Bitcoin trading volume](https://coin.dance/volume/localbitcoins) on localbitcoins.com, you can clearly see that the trend of trading is clearly up... so demand is rising. (And you can also see the spike from late 2017.)

I much more simply think that the world is not ready to go crypto yet. I tried to talk many friends into it, and they are just not touching it.

Show respect where it‚Äôs due.,1524155144

Anyone who is being honest with themselves and has done 15 minutes of research knows the only reason btc is even still alive is because of name recognition. It will die eventually and it's place will promptly be taken by it's competitors. ,1524155072

"My guess is that Amazon really just wants to be able to better verify who someone is so that they can incorporate Bitcoin and related cryptocurrencies into their own shopping payment options (both for them selling and sellers using their platform).

"The block size should be set as low as possible to do the task that is requested of it. 1 MB might seem arbitrary, but it was part of the initial design. The reason increasing the block size without a *need* is a bad idea is because all of these blocks have to propagate across all full nodes. Larger blocks lead to exponentially larger nodes. These larger nodes can deter users from running their own node, and at extremes, financially and technologically prevent the average user from being able to run a full node. Less nodes means less decentralization. The reason the block size discussion is silly is because it is a patch (e.g. bandaid) solution for short term results, but does not fix the real scaling issue. It's irresponsible and lazy development, and Bitcoin doesn't have room for such responses to potential problems.",1524154924

"you need to research some more about the bip39 password.
It works like this.

You have a seed, 24 words, okay?
Think of the bip39 password as a 25th word for your seed. But it creates entirely different addresses, its another wallet entirely.

Ledger and Trezor support this, so in the end you have two PIN numbers, one access the ""regular"" wallet from the 24 word seed, and the other one access the ""hidden"" wallet from the 24 word + 25th word.

The single word is not the entire seed, you still need the 24 words, but it provides the additional security features:

1) If your seed is exposed to someone, say the cleaning lady, she will only have access to your main wallet, because she does not now that there is a hidden wallet. You can monitor your funds, and if your funds move, your main wallet has been compromised and you should move your hidden wallet funds.

2)  An attacker that demands via physical violence that you give him your BTC can think that you only have the BTC that is on the main wallet, because he does not know you have a hidden wallet. If you keep ""reasonable"" funds on the main wallet, you can say that you sold your btc and all you have now is that.

3) As for the security of this single word, for it to be vulnerable to brute forcing, people must know that you have a hidden wallet on that seed, so that is the main security point. You can, if you want, make it whatever size you want, but remember: As it should not be written anywhere, you should not make it error-prone.",1524154704

But IMO, nobody is using even Bitcoin for payments: it's rather a store of value, a way to have real control of your money / be your own bank, an investment, etc but how many people is using it for daily things?

I think your comment about them being single uses coins could possibly apply to Ripple (their CEO is famously known by his ""peanut butter manifesto"" which basically means that a company should laser focus on few things, but do them extremely well and then expand) but definitely not to VeChain or Icon. VeChain is still misconceived as only a ""supply chain coin"" but it's so much more than that since the re-branding - it'll be the most enterprise used crypto. Think of it as a better version of Ethereum rather than supply chain. It's uses are almost infinite and it'll start having ICOs as well.

"I'm thinking about doing another historical ""What if?"" analysis like my previous posts from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8bauts/a_brief_history_of_the_20132015_crypto_bear/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8bmi5y/a_brief_history_of_the_2013_market_peak_why_some/). Before starting another one, though, I wanted to seek input on the research questions and methodology.

In my previous analyses, I looked at what would have happened if you'd bought in near the bottom of the 2013-2015 bear market (TL;DR: Even bottom-of-the-barrel alts would have made you more money than BTC, assuming that you could unload them today (low volume being an issue)), and what would have happened if you'd bought in near the peak of the 2013 bull run (TL;DR: Don't buy high, although you'd still have been up 25%, virtually all of that gain was from BTC). 

So, for my next analysis, I want to start with the assumption that it's impossible to predict the bottom of a bear market, and look at what would have happened if you'd bought near the middle of the 2013-2015 bear market (i.e., roughly halfway between the top and the bottom). 

Per [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/), the total cryptocurrency market capitalization peaked at around ~$15.7 billion in early December 2013, and bottomed out around $3.1 billion in January of 2015. Even after bottoming out, however, the market didn't hit $15 billion again until June of 2016. The halfway point between the top and the bottom is roughly ~$9.5 billion. So, I want to find a [historical snapshot](https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/) of a date where the market cap was around ~$9.5B. Pickings are slim, however. 

Right now, I'm looking at using one of the following snapshots:

- March 8, 2014. Market Cap: ~$9.19 billion. Only 149 coins listed, though. 

- June 8, 2014. Market Cap: ~$9.13 billion. 290 coins listed. The market didn't reach this level again until 2016.

- May 29, 2016. Market Cap: ~10.26 billion. 604 coins lists. I don't love this date because it's in the middle of the bull run that led back to the $15 billion mark, suggesting that the timing would have been too convenient for the analysis. 

Methodology: Once I pick one of the above dates, I'm going to do an analysis in which an equal amount is invested into 60 coins--the top 20, 20 from the middle, and 20 from the bottom. I'm thinking of imposing a minimum volume requirement for the middle and bottom coins--maybe $2k in volume per day for the middle coins and $500 per day for the bottom coins. Does that sound reasonable?

In my previous analysis, I looked at blocks of coins (e.g., 30th-50th). This time, I want to look at a broader sample. I'm thinking I'm going to take every 5th coin that meets the daily volume requirement to build each sample. So, if the total market was 290 coins, the middle sample would be the 25th, 30th, 35th, etc. up to 120th, and the bottom sample, would be the 125th onward.

So, what do people think of the research design? Are there additional research questions you'd like to see answered? Do you have any suggestions for the methodology? Thanks in advance!",1524153618

The second red flag can be found when said members are seen constantly trying to bring down the Bitcoin name whilst confusing new investors (negatively affecting the whole market) to shill their own version of the coin where the only benefactors of the price increase are a handful of individuals (the BCH executives). Don't believe their propaganda when they claim ""BCH is the real Bitcoin!"" Then back it up with made up ""evidence"".

If you hold yourself to only spending $1000, then the rest of those gains can go to further padding your investment.

That latter part eventually becomes untrue, even if it takes years or decades.  You can see this pattern everywhere, if you look hard enough.

For what it's worth, Bitcoin has gone through the same thing.  At the beginning, the goal was to create a better economy than the banks and governments provided.  Then Bitcoin became established (among tech people at least).  Nowadays, Bitcoin supporters reject the new upstarts by saying that Bitcoin is the best known, it has the longest history, etc.",1524153066

I was answering to his comment regarding using BitPay card.

My argument regarding using bitcoin as a currency is perfectly valid. 

If I keep my bitcoin and spend my fiat, I will be keeping my best performing asset while spending my worst performing asset. It's a perfectly valid option. At the end of the month, my fiat value will be the same at best, or loose value at worse. On the other hand, bitcoin has a high probability of becoming more valuable. 

Since the only way for me to spend Bitcoin in my daily life, is to exchange it for Fiat, there's no valid reason to do it. I'll just keep my Bitcoin and look at it as an investment asset and not as a currency. ",1524152760

"Its because no one from Verge could post in here without being downvoted to oblivion, and they kept coming onto our forum talking nonsense and downvoting like, innocuous posts form Verge supporters..on our own forum lol..so sad.  Like someone would say ""Go Verge !"" and it would have a -1 score...they would invade our forum and talk smack and if we tried to say anything to defend the coin on here..they would downvote and then anyone with less than 100 karma cannot even post on here, so essentially most Verge supporters who were failry new.could not even post on here.  I posted 1 comment once defending the coin as it was all cc Monero shills killing Verge..and...I got a -134 karma on ONE post.  Just simply defending Verge with factual information.  It was like a mob riot, they kept saying the coin is a ""Scam"" the partnership ""doesn't exist"" etc. etc. etc. ..total nonsense.  Now the parternship is here, its with a company making 200-300 mil per year, 10x times what the top darkweb site makes, its not even close.  So now they aren't as wildly stupid..but still compleetely jealous and not with reality on what Verge is and what it is doing.

In terms of your Q's its too many...you gotta research.  ask me like 2 or 3 of your most pressing questions and I can answer 2 or 3.

Basically Monero is invisible by default, which means it will NEVER be adopted as the most used coin by large businesses.  Whereas Verge is privacy OPTIONAL (they are working on RingCT too..and it will probably be an OPTION)  this means, like bitcoin, it offers SOME privacy..but is also not going to get like, regulated like Monero might, and its not some shady invisible coin that is tied to darkweb stuff, which will never get mainstream adoption. Monero backers cannot understand these concepts and kept bashing the coin saying the partnership was fake blah blah..

90% of the world does not need invisible transactions, and large businesses will never work with or adopt that.  That is why Verge is ready for mainstream adoption, even if it is ""less"" private.  90% of the world does not want or need that...they want something fast, and easy to use, with SOME privacy, and with an OPTIONAL RingCT option (in Alpha now)  that is looking very good....

Bitcoin was made by a dude in his room, this is another dude in his room...and Steve Jobs and Bill Gates were both arrested for similar goofy stuff around the same age as Sunerok.  They use anything they can to bash the coin..and none of it works. Because 90% of the world is not sitting on this CC sub bashing other coins with meme-level thinking.  They were doing that for weeks, while...Verge got a 200-300 mil per year partner which is 10x larger than anything Monero has done, and even most any privacy coin.  

If you understand the need for OPTIONAL privacy you will understand Verge and how its more ready for adoption than most other privacy coins.  Also Monero is slower and more expensive, will never be used in a retail experience if you have to wait 5 minutes for a charge to go through, minimum.  (sometimes hours apparently)  Why would you even need an invisible transaction in a retailer face to face anyway ?  lol..its silly.  Their coin is like, made for only a small subset of business, the darkweb, which is like 1% or less of world business and it will forever be stuck in that area.   Verge however, can have purchases made in seconds, 30 seconds or less, and can absolutely be used in ANY setting, and...is already gaining adoption and will continue until it is used in face to face retail, in anything.  with OPTIONAL privacy.which is what 90% of people want and need...not some darkweb-level nonsense . I like Monero but its stuck with just that Niche use.  and they don't even understand why...

"1. The main dev is called sunerok. There are also contributions from outside but can't really comment on that. Have a look at github: https://github.com/vergecurrency  
It doesn't look like the team includes cryptographers as the code is copied into one repo from several other cryptocurrency projects, e.g. [stealth.cpp](https://github.com/vergecurrency/VERGE/blob/master/src/stealth.cpp) is copied by ""The ShadowCoin Developers""  
2. Github commits aren't happening daily. So I would say: no  
3. This is very unclear. They did open a crowdfunding to enable Verge payment option in Pornhub but development-wise it is probably the developer holding many coins. Also, I received word that they plan to send 2% of all block rewards to the developer account by doing a hard fork. [german-only source](https://www.btc-echo.de/watch-my-block-verge/)  
4. Verge has been called ""DogecoinDark"" before the rebranding. Developers say it is a fork of Bitcoin; however, Verge addresses have the same format as Doge addresses. Also, bear in mind that there is also other code from different projects (e.g. the stealth.cpp)  
5. It aims to be a privacy coin for everyday use  
6. Implementing RingCT that is already actively used in Monero for one year. [Roadmap](https://vergecurrency.com/roadmap/)  
7. Verge does use 5 different mining algorithms where each block there is another algorithm. I am not a miner and can't comment on this. Didn't find a website displaying the hashrate(s). On the number of node: some hours ago I tried to sync a Verge full node for testing purposes and it failed several times with the error ""no node(s) found"". When I tried again later I got one node (that is really bad). Website and Twitter account are maintained by sunerok.  
8. Wallets are listet [here](https://vergecurrency.com/wallets/). There are Windows, macOS and Linux full node wallets, written in QT (cross platform), as well as electrum wallets. Also there seems to be an Android wallet with reviews of 3.4 in average. I did only test macOS full node (should be the same on Windows and Linux) and it is really crappy tbh. Crashing multiple time and no way to turn off Tor -&gt; syncing took too long so I did use a bootstrap.zip. Very bad UX. Know some people who tested the Electrum wallet: it does not allow the creation of stealth addresses, so basically it is Bitcoin Electrum + Tor running on a different chain.  
9. There are also Telegram and Discord channels  
10. Good marketing team.  
11. Basically everything else: toxic community, censorship in every channel, not a private coin (but promoted as one), pump&amp;dump coin, missing deadlines (Wraith)  
12. Verge tries to protect privacy using the protocol ""Wraith"" they did develop. Wraith does use Tor to obfuscate your IP and stealth addresses to obfuscate the receiver. Tor itself is pretty useless because transactions are still linkable (imagine using Bitcoin with Tor: exchanges and merchants still know your addresses/txs and can link them together). Stealth addresses are a real first step towards privacy but 1. they are only implemented in the fullnode 2. they only protect the receiver (Pornhub still knows the sending address) and 3. they are protected in a bad way because the receiver first has to generate a stealth address which is bad UX.  
13. If the dealer has bad intention or gets caught your sending address will be public and can be linked back without any obstacles.  

I did my research on Verge (also did download the full node) to test it a bit. However, it fails to deliver the promised privacy. If you have any further questions, please ask!  

If you are looking for a privacy coin lookup [Monero](https://getmonero.org) as it delivers full privacy by several techniques (stealth addresses, ring signatures, ring CT). Also they are developing the I2P Router Kovri and are also looking into building something like a LN for Monero.

"Hey, has anybody used gate.io as an exchange before?

I am dealing with an issue with them which I would consider a bug, but their support claims is correct behavior. I have never seen this behavior at any other exchange and want to know if I'm just naive or not. Has anyone else dealt with this issue, and do you know of a fix?

For every other exchange I've worked with, you can simulate a market order using a limit order by setting the price outside the normal range. For example, in the ETH-BTC market, if the low ask is 0.07 BTC, and I want to buy 100 ETH at market price, I can place a limit order to buy 100 ETH at a price &gt; 0.07, such as 0.1 BTC. The exchange will fill my 100 ETH order with the best price available, as long as it's less than 0.1 BTC.

On gate.io, you'll experience the same behavior when using the above technique with sells, but not with buys.

In the above example, gate.io's logic plays out like this:

    1. They determine how much total BTC my order was worth. In this case, 100 ETH * 0.1 BTC = 10 BTC
    2. They keep buying ETH until:
        A) I have spent 10 BTC in total to buy ETH
        B) The low ask exceeds my given price of 0.1 BTC

When you apply the above logic, what ends up happening is that the exchange will end up purchasing well over 100 ETH for me (because 10 BTC is worth more than 100 ETH). This is despite the fact that I requested 100 ETH in the ""amount"" field.

All I am trying to do is purchase **exactly** 100 ETH, but gate.io simply purchases too much for me. I've also tried just setting my price to the current low ask, but due to lag times, the low ask can change while I'm placing my order, and after applying their logic, I also end up purchasing an amount that is different from what I specified.

Anyway, is this logic normal? It seems completely retarded to me. Anyone know of any strategies to buy exactly 100 ETH on an exchange that operates like this?",1524150716

"lol no, I'm not a web developer.  Some things just need explaining.  

For example, let's look a portion of the 'decode_account' method in 'rai/lib/numbers.cpp':

    bool rai::uint256_union::decode_account (std::string const &amp; source_a)
    {
    	auto error (source_a.size () != 64);
    	if (!error)
    	{
    		if (source_a[0] == 'x' &amp;&amp; source_a[1] == 'r' &amp;&amp; source_a[2] == 'b' &amp;&amp; (source_a[3] == '_' || source_a[3] == '-') &amp;&amp; (source_a[4] == '1' || source_a[4] == '3'))
    		{
				....

Focus on that 'if' statement.  Now, without documentation, can you immediately tell me what it is doing, and why?  

It is validating the account prefix, we can figure that much out pretty quickly -- however, the *why* is unclear.  For instance, why are 'xrb-1' and 'xrb_1' both valid?  Why are '1' and '3' the only valid versions?  Guess we have to dig up the docs... (can you see how this wastes time?)

And I haven't even mentioned yet how ugly it is.  Really, that statement should be in its method, e.g.:

	bool is_valid_account_prefix(std::string const &amp; account)
	{
		// &lt;Insert detailed explanation here&gt;
		const std::string xrb_prefix(""xrb"");
		bool is_valid = (account.compare(0, xrb_prefix.size(), xrb_prefix) &lt; 1)
			&amp;&amp; (account[3] == '_' || account[3] == '-')
			&amp;&amp; (account[4] == '1' || account[4] == '3');

		return is_valid;
	}
	
Even without comments, the above method greatly improves clarity.  And that's just one example, I could pull out hundreds more.

No one thinks those things about themselves. Of course they rally together and find support among each other to validate their ideas. What else would anyone have expected to happen?

I'm sorry its just absurd. You can be the biggest BCH fan in the world and still understand how ridiculous that is. 

Which is why you want it to just be ""Bitcoin"" in the first place. It's not enough for BCH to ""overtake"" BTC before this is plausible. It has to **eradicate** BTC.

"It's a smart move to buy BCH now before the May fork, because I'd the May fork comes off without contention or problems, this is clear evidence that the BTC Core devs are wrong that forking is ""too dangerous"" and BTC will be quickly left in the dust by BCH. All significant development and energy will be drawn to BCH where new and exciting things can still happen in the protocol, whereas BTC is forever dead and stale at the protocol level.

Similarly, anyone wanting to build crypto apps on BTC will have to do it as a Lightning app (Lapp) and deal with the complexities of integrating segwit. And then few will even be able to use your app, because few are using segwit, and fewer still can even use Lightning. So barely anyone can even try your shiny new Lapp.

Meanwhile, BCH development is closer to the metal, you aren't developing for some 2nd layer bullshit, you're touching the blockchain directly with your app, and literally everyone in BCH can use your app day one.

BTC is a bit like when Sega released the 32x add-on for Genesis. Then it's releasing games for the add-on, but now you've split your own user-base.

That's a stupid thing to do. And purposefully reducing the utility of the coin by giving up on all aspects that are not ""store of value""--i.e. by giving up on using it for transactions, means Core has ceded that entire market sector to BCH.

We've got a lock on the future. It's only a matter of time before BCH is outshining everyone anywhere near our market cap, and we begin advancing up the charts to challenge BTC itself.

And I do more research than the avg Joe, so I'm pretty confident I can outperform the avg person.

However, for someone elderly, putting money in crypto is just silly (my personal opinion). I mean, as long as they have enough money to survive off, if they live until they are 110, then that's fine I guess.

Bitcoin has not technical solution for this. You have to trust the network.

Nope lol. Never owned any btc. ,1524148959
"so here's my take: bitcoin's security relies on hashrate, hashrate is provided by miners for economic incentives, incentives are inflation and fees, inflation is quickly diminishing and was only put in place to avoid pre-mining all coins and get miners on-board, over time more and more incentive will be coming from tx fees.

*there has to be a reasonable fee market and reasonable fee market means that fees go high when demand goes up. without reasonable fee market miners have no economic incentive to provide chain security.*

the promise of keeping the fees as low as possible by bumping block size every time throughput hits the ceiling means destroying the fee market and has one of two conseqences:

- rules about bitcoin inflation will have to be adjusted to keep providing miners with economic incentive
- miners will leave, hashrate will drop and with it - value of the currency/network

so yes, bitcoin was never designed to be a charity. if you want to maintain value of bitcoin through security of the network you have to understand why fees matter.

P.S. PoS is not a solution, marginal revenue always = marginal cost and PoS just obscures the cost and pushes it out of simple ""i've burned this amount of energy"" into political aspect of fighting for control over the stake to maximize profits.",1524148951
"&gt;BCH is a viable sound money that is easily workable to become the next worldwide reserve currency.

It's not stable and it's not widely convertible so not really. About the only thing it ticks the boxes on are that it's free from direct government intervention and that there aren't any capital controls.  There is no chance it'll become a reserve currency any time soon (so.. within the next decade..).

And while confusion in the marketplace is to be expected, it has a negative impact. Just for context, taking the largest numbers I can find suggests that there are about 12m active bitcoin users (the lowest bound on that is 3m) that's nowhere near mass adoption for a currency. ",1524148950

OP is predicting a blackswan event where it skyrockets to new ATH after a months of a bear market. This is actually a lot more possible than people think though because bitcoin has never existed during global recession or economic crisis. The stock market has been in a bull run for years and is due for a correction whilst at the same time institutional investors now have many ways buying bitcoin in large amounts.

Then it should be more of a federal audit and not at the state level (of a state in which Kraken doesn't even operate any longer). The truth of the matter is that New York made unreasonable obstacles for blockchain companies/exchanges with the NY bitlicense and was another way for them to generate revenue (i.e. exploit) blockchain and charge high fees to apply for this license. 

While you may see their response as childish, I think they did what more people should do at overbearing and aggressive government requests. They called out an unreasonable request and hopefully will set an example. I'm not saying that no regulations or oversight should exist, but it needs to be approached in a more organized global level. In the US, states often operate/regulate/license independent of one another and it makes for cumbersome and exhaustive measures for individuals/entities to obtain approval/licensure from each individual state.

"Bigger blocks and faster block times are all, as it can be seen on countless other alts, quick and dirty fixes that do not work in long run. They work, but only as short term solutions with drawbacks later on in time.

For example, how many blocks do you have to wait until exchange accepts your payment in some other fast block coins? 10, 20, 50....as i trade alt's i have seen it all. Having to wait 20 mins or more on alt that produces block every minute etc.
Block speed is no magic wand. It has it's own problems (orphan blocks and stuff like that).

Block size, same deal with different set of problems. You can easy remove block limit size and puff, fee's are out of the window, just like that, but in return you get coin that once it starts to be used by masses will be so centralized that you'll be glad there are Banks around as only huge businesses will be able to store all the data.

Let's make an example:
1 MB vanilla blocks support 4 transactions per second
Visa has around 1600 transactions (avarage) per second (googled it up)
To support Visa number of transactions, block size should be 400 MB

Let's see how would blockchain look like as far as storage goes:

400 MB per block
2.4 GB per hour
57.6 GB per day
1.728 TB per month (30 day month)
20.736 TB per year

And that's if we never ever grow past Visa.....

Now, tell me, who would be able to have full node and be ""your own bank"" with that kind of blockchain?

Do you see the problem? Faster block and larger blocks are easy short term solutions that make your life tougher as time goes on and centralize network.

No....i do not support it and i do not think it's good. I don't think that picking easy way out is good in any situation.

I think that working with multipliers is way we need to scale. You see, SegWit is multiplier. For same block size, you get effective 2.4 MB blocks. Than transaction batching....again, for same block size, more transactions, shnorr signatures....same etc. Than after those small on chain, in protocol multipliers you have huge multiplier in form of LN that bumps it up to the moon (transactions per second, not price).

But, far in the future, when IoT devices will be using crypto, even LN might not be enough.

Than you bump up block size. With simple 2MB block in that far future, you don't get 8 transactions per second (double to vanilla 1mb block), you get 8*segwit*batching*schnor*LN. for simple 1MB extra per block, you get millions per second, if not more!

That is hard way, but that is right way too.

And thanks for your question...you just gave me idea for my next blog post....",1524146009

"So I mentioned this a few times before, but I think this next bull season is going to go in 2 phases:

1) Old money getting out of tether

2) New money hopping on FOMO train.

3) BTC hits scaling issues again


**Phase 1, Old money exiting tether**

This phase will have alts run faster than BTC, because this old money has previous projects they were supporting. They are going to jump back into those projects, pick up alts on sale (Neo, Eth, Ven, OMG, Nano, etc (my portfolio)).

In this phase, BTC dominance falls, alts go on a run.

**Phase 2: New money FOMOs in**

New money starts FOMO'ing in and where do they buy? They buy BTC mostly, some ETH, some LTC, some BCH. Basically, whatever is on Coinbase.

Old money sees the BTC run and tries to ride the bull as long as he wants to romp around. Alts go down as people sell them to jump on BTC. 

BTC dominance soars, alts don't fall, but they watch BTC have bigger days than them.

**Phase 3: BTC hits scaling issues again**

People start getting mad at BTC for being slow. New money starts reading about alts. People trade BTC for alts. Their next purchases are no longer BTC, but ETH, LTC, BCH.

BTC dominance starts falling. It doesn't stall (still a FOMO market), but it starts going sideways) as people pick up alts.

.......

Those are just my predictions on how the next bull run looks like. It will look slightly different than the last one, simply because there's more people in tether at the start of it. These tether people aren't going to untether into BTC (they will to an extent), but they will mostly untether back into their alt portfolio (which may include some BTC, even a large percentage, but not 90+%, like what happens when new money enters).


Thoughts? 

Just my humble opinion that you want to be in BTC only like 10-20% now, and be in alts. Just for now. Once the new money comes in, you want to jump over to BTC before everyone else does, and get your seat on that bull (a first class seat). Then once it starts going sideways and hits scaling issues, you want to jump back into your alts, and again, do it before others do.

"It is strange, but it's unsurprising. I played with it a lot early on, because it was novel and it showed promise, the lack of adoption as an actual currency was the barrier that I figured would remain (and it has) and that would limit utility.  That and the fact it was quite hard to use anyway (The granny test etc..).

So I acquired and shared, swapped, transferred, mined, lost and generally bounced bitcoins all over the place (I never had many, I think about 12 all in..).  I never thought they'd be worth massive amounts per coin (I was impressed when it went to $1..).  

Now that they are are worth vast sums, it has changed the equation. The existing problems (spending them..) still remains, most people can't do their grocery shopping with bitcoin, and a lot of people wouldn't want to. They have gone from being currency like, through appreciating asset and speculative asset, to essentially stores of wealth to be converted into fiat when the value rises.

The fact that the value has risen so massively has, in my view, reduced both utility and any viable wide scale adoption. The explosion of other cryptocurrencies has offset that a bit, but that has then added in issues of exploitative schemes and fraud.  You can add the confusion created by things like bitcoin cash, and the linkages between cryptocurrencies and their forks too.

The technology is still interesting, and there is still a lot of possibility, but things haven't quite gone how I would have hoped.  Throw in that there are now so many odd, and frankly counter-intuitive applications where block-chains are shoehorned in, and that major banks and financial services providers seem to be creating centralised tokens of their own and even that fades a bit.

"you do know his 1 million BTC fortune is spread over some 50,000 addresses? i doubt even Satoshi envisioned how much BTC would be worth in the future. he was much more interested in the technology. he mined the first 50k blocks or so by himself and that was before BTC even had a monetary value, it was worth literally nothing. i don't think he bothered saving all the private keys to all those 50k addresses because he didn't think it would be worth the time. 

honestly, i think Satoshi is one individual. He's still alive but is staying anonymous for the sake of his survival - a government agency would be swift to take him down. Bitcoin needs Satoshi to stay away from the project to be successful. i dont think he bothered saving all the private keys, so he doesn't have access to the 1 million BTC. he may have a much smaller personal stash worth millions that he's probably living on today. 

its not some bogeyman conspiracy. satoshi was some normal, but incredibly gifted, dude. he made a currency that he never expected to grow as large as it did (although he designed to the protocol to scale to that level if it were to be that popular, no one ever expects massive success like that) and didn't bother saving the, at the time, worthless currency.

This is a private setting, with rules that are enforced. That said, *relevant* discussion of alts, as opposed to opportunistic sales pitches, are usually tolerated. And if you prefer more of a mixing-pot, there are other communities that are more inclusive of the entire cryptocurrency industry, such as /r/CryptoCurrency.

That all said, I think you should revisit how you make investment decisions. Judge the investment on its own technical merits, instead of focusing on the baggage carried by its enthusiast community.  ",1524145239

Yes, I agree. Which I think is one of the reasons Christine Laggard made the announcement this week - it marks a shift in the IMF's attitude to cryptocurrency and bitcoin, for this very reason you've just mentioned.

Also, the OP quoting Satoshi is spot on. A subtle point perhaps missed about the central bank being trusted not to debase the currency, is that Satoshi was saying there is now something akin to a neo-gold like standard (bitcoin).

"Chargebacks are another problem raising prices for consumers. There are people who abuse chargebacks, using them when the item they paid for was delivered correctly. Here again is a problem for merchants that decreases their ability to deliver the best experience and cost for customers on what they offer, as they must also factor in unscrupulous actors.

What recourse does a person have after handing over cash? There is no chargeback option with cash, and yet it's the best way to pay for things. If one could pay for things with cash over the Internet, that would be the right way to go. You may wonder what happens if the merchant is at fault. That's a legitimate concern, but the right way to handle it is not with chargebacks which can be abused. Other things should occur. For example, the merchant could be tracked down and confronted, the same as would happen after using cash. Nobody wants an unpleasant situation erupting. Alternatively, a merchant can suffer negative PR by word of mouth, which if bad enough can put them out of business. The problem we have right now with things like credit cards and PayPal is issues with payments and security are being handled inefficiently and/or incorrectly. With crypto we have an opportunity to fix these things, making a better experience for all parties to a transaction overall. :)",1524144473

"These are the transactions:

1) Buy BTC at unknown price (no info provided)

2) Exchange it for COINX. Total proceeds, (10k) x ($100) = $1 Million.

Capital gains triggered here. No info on starting price, so I can't tell how much he spent on the BTC originally. When I read this, I assumed that steps 1 and 2 were done within minutes of eachother and there would be no profit here.  However, if there is, you must pay taxes on the gains.

3) Now COINX goes up 100x. 

However, no trades of COINX are done, so no capital gains yet. 

4) If now he trades COINX into Fiat, or back into BTC, or into anything else... gives it in barter for a 100 million eggs that are worth $1 each, now he must pay capital gains on the delta between acquisition and sale of COINX. Essentially capital gains of $99 million dollars.

However, until he makes that transaction, no gains are sealed in.


For that reason, in the next tax year, lets say it's Dec and so far this year you have lost $100k on crypto, and the losses are sealed in. On Dec 31st 2018 you can trade some ETH for BTC, such that the capital gains is $100k (based on whatever you acquired the ETH for). Now you seal in the capital gains on that, to take advantage of your $100k capital losses early this year. Now you owe no tax. 

Again, Canada works like this, double check US tax law. You may have some wonky rules on how much capital losses you can have, etc. I have no idea what your laws are, but I just know they are relatively similar.

What screwed people this year is that they had this situation happen:

1) Buy BTC cheap before Nov.

2) Nov runup happens. Alt run starts. Sell BTC for alts. Capital gains are now sealed in.

3) Dec 31 passes by and we enter 2018. All shapshots on capital gains/losses are now final.

4) Jan, Feb, March happens and the alts they traded their BTC for have lost value bigtime.

5) Tax season comes, they owe $80k in taxes. However, they haven't actually sold crypto back to fiat... they just exchanged BTC for alts, and the alts crashed 70%-80%. Now they need to find a way to come up with $100k but their alts are only worth 100k. They now have to sell 80% of their crypto stack just to pay taxes for ""gains"" they had in 2017. These gains are now gone, but that doesn't matter, Big Brother wants his money.

6) Crypto market crashes, because TONS AND TONS of people were in that boat.


So now where are we today?

Taxes are done and paid for. People have squared that up. They now have 50, 60, 80, 100k worth of capital losses in 2018 so far, but only 20k money in the market.

People start buying the dip.

Next year won't be as brutal, because people are going to be smarter about this, planning for it, and also carrying forward massive capital losses which should offset capital gains from the upcoming bullrun. (being optimistic here, but all signs point to BULL).


So this next tax season shouldn't be as bad... but if you are just getting started right now on the ground floor, you need to learn a lesson from people in 2017. If you have massive capital gains, you may want to wait until Jan 1st 2019 to ""seal them in"", so just buy and hold. Don't sell crypto to crypto. If you do, try to keep an eye on what your rolling capital gains is at. 

Be prepared and have a way to pay them. If we get a big bull run, make sure you take some fiat profits so that your hand isn't forced into selling your stack on the dip.",1524144110

But when evolution steps to far away from your initial vision you might need to overthink your fundamentals and point out where it lost it track to overcome those issues in the future.

"&gt;P.S. I can see how supporters of Bitcoin (BTC) can also be irritated by the naming situation, but I'd recommend they be more like Vitalik - accept the fork (in his case Ethereum Classic) gracefully even though it includes the original name. After all, unlike Vitalik's case, YOU (small blockers) told us to fork off.

I think this misrepresents the Bitcoin community. No one is ""irritated"" by Bitcoin Cash being Bitcoin Cash or calling itself Bitcoin Cash, with whatever ticker you prefer, whether that's BCH or something else. The real point of attrition comes when **this** community starts to confuse and mislead people by incorrectly comparing software (Bitcoin Core) with a cryptocurrency (Bitcoin Cash), or by referring to Bitcoin Cash as *the real* Bitcoin. Jihan Wu, I think we all agree he's a big supporter of Bitcoin Cash, condemned this behaviour on more than one occasion.

People referring to Bitcoin as Bitcoin Core are doing so with a very well thought out and malicious intent. Well, at least whoever came up with it did. Yes, the intent is malicious because it aims at reducing Bitcoin to ""just *some* possible Bitcoin"". The ultimate goal is obvious, and has been stated many times and openly here, which is to take possession of the Bitcoin name and, ultimately, ticker. 

You cannot expect the community to just quietly and submissively accept it. So when you say

&gt;I'd recommend they be more like Vitalik - accept the fork (in his case Ethereum Classic) gracefully even though it includes the original name.

this comes across as extremely patronizing. I can guarantee, and willing to stake some Bitcoin (!!), that if this community stops the misleading name calling, small blockers will accept Bitcoin Cash, just like every other coin is accepted.

&amp;nbsp;

It's not about ""containing the original name"". After all no one has a problem with Bitcoin Gold/Diamond/Atom/God/Private or any of the [many (50!!) forks](https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/01/24/forking-great-up-to-50-bitcoin-forks-in-2018/) that could happen in 2018.

"The issue is that strict adherence to the austrian school of economics is a farce. 

It doesn't account for the producer and therefore doesn't account in reality for the consumer. The market doesn't produce good that we *need* as assuredly as the preachers of the religion of supply and demand would have you believe. Medical research for instance is one such example, in which the interest of the producer isn't to cure the consumer. Additionally producers tend to invest their money in things that currently have value, as a result the market fails to anticipate the needs of the consumer in the long run (see: antibiotics). 

I like crypto because I dislike banking as an institution and fundamentally disagree with the economics of a fiat currency as a it banking and market control.",1524143606
"some critical words towards the direction BTC is going, or lets rather say, is being pumped/dumped into. I know this is general chat and not the critical discussion topic, but anyway.

imho it is very noticable that certain patters in BTC seem to repeat after a certain while. e.g. take this formation here: https://www.tradingview.com/x/Fg3u3m8P

another example is the similarity of the BTC charts from 2014 and end 2017/2018 so far. all this leaves room for a certain amount of predictability as where we are heading to as trend.

I know that all this sounds a lot like tinfoil hat stuff, but imho there is one big argument in favour of this: The repetition of patterns like these gives all participating parties (whales, institutional money, exchanges) a kind of guideline of what is happening next, approx where and when a pump is going to go next, without much need for communication otherwise. Due to this reason I dont find all this patterning stuff not too far fetched at all.

thoughts?",1524143594
Funny thing is that sunerok never hyped it as as biggest in the history .. He said it might be the biggest adoption of a non top3 coin and a massive partnership- which might be even true..

"why do people keep on talking about attributing an entire wallets balance and lightning network. this patent and discussion is not about that.

"For your purposes, you don't have to figure that out. The software takes care of everything automatically.  

You'd need to figure out your private key only in order to back it up (offline) or for exporting your wallet's balance into another wallet. To be honest, I don't really know what the best practice for Bitcoin Core would be in such a case.  

I think it's enough if you copy the wallet.dat file on an external hard disk/USB, so you'd be safe in case anything happens on your desktop wallet, but perhaps someone else with more experience will chime in here. ",1524143468
"I was threatened with a site wide reddit ban for referring to ""bitcoin cash"" the second letter in the alphabet cash.

"I've shared these same opinions..

I'm not 100% fully informed on Bitcoin Cash's Dev team and any trouble they've stirred up.. Their mission is simply to follow the Whitepaper which does say ""We define an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures"" imo that does give them some legitimacy as not just being a random BTC clone to gain a quick buck like BTG's premine.

Yet I only hear of bad things and censorship from Bitcoin's core Dev team &amp; r/Bitcoin. But i'll admit i haven't been 100% caught up to date w/the drama.. So my old opinion is irrelevant but not sure if the FUD surrounding Bitcoin Cash is entirely warranted.

"&gt; Nobody seems to be counting out WW3 

Too much sensationalism. Like that fucking doomsday clock that IIRC is closer to the midnight now than during cold war. Do you think the relations between US and Russia are now worse than during cold war? They even use Russian rockets to launch stuff into space for crying out loud. The wars of the future are waged in economics and cyberspace not in nukes. Politicians aren't that retarded.

&gt;I'm skeptical that continuing to play by the rules that have landed us in this recklessly precarious global financial situation is ""thinking in the long term"" either.

Mortgage crisis happened exactly because everyone was busy masturbating to their short term rewards and goals and nobody bothered to look at the whole picture and scrutinize the whole circus. 

By the long term I mean more transparency, more scrutiny, more accountability and less shadiness. Is there something wrong with that? I don't think so. Right now a large chunk of cryptospace is still hiding in the dark, opaque institutions without transparency and accountability and with dubious legitimacy. I think this must end  or crypto will never be taken seriously.",1524143365

But you totally don't have to use it When it comes to bcash blockchain, roger even says it will work better on Bcash.

What onslaught.....which metrics indicate an onslaught? What a meaningless sentence.

All my money is already bitcoin. And the government has no idea about it.,1524142984
"&gt; Does this all work based off of my IP address?

No, your IP address doesn't have anything to do with it. Your receiving bitcoin address (= public key) is generated by the underlying private key. When you export your private key to another wallet, all the incoming and outgoing transactions belonging to that key are transferred too, as well as the full control of all coins on that key.  

That's why it's important to never let anyone know your private key and also why you are not committed to a specific wallet.. Because you can always export your private key, import it into another wallet and then continue using your coins as before.

"&gt; I think history serves to show ICOs are thinly veiled means of circumventing securities laws. The vast majority of ICOs have been scams and failed projects. RSK will I am sure be used by people making erc20 tokens since the same code will work, but at least the platform itself cannot have an ICO. Having an ICO immediately calls into question legitimacy of a project.

You have a very narrow view of ICOs. A vast majority of companies that dont do ICOs or presales (not inside the crypto realm) also fail, what is your point?

Unfortunately, since the community split, both subs become echo chambers. I wish it wasn't the case, but it is.

&gt;Also by your logic, do you consider LTC or ETH not an alt? How about BNB?

LTC and ETH aren't forks of the same chain BTC and BCH originated from, so I do consider them alts (though ETH I'd a strong coin and I do root for it just as much as BCH). I don't know what BNB is.

&gt;I thought through this a little more. I don't think we really need the term alt at all, but if we insist on using it, I think only one coin can claim the non-alt title by definition. That one should should be the most impactful on the crypto space. Right now that is btc. If it moves, it has the greatest impact on other coins.

Fine, but that's a tie for all four relevant coins. They all started in January 2009.

rBTC is a terrible place to find information.

Still, they sent these letters to major crypto exchanges presumably in good faith in order to obtain information that would assist them in their task for greater transparency and investor protection. I see nothing wrong with that. If you read the questionnaire you'll see they are reasonable questions and there is nothing wrong with a bit more transparency and honesty.

Some of those exchanges officially deny US citizens from their services because they don't want to be subjected to US jurisdiction. Which is even more hilarious because why would Kraken CEO rage that hard about a letter from an organisation that is more like an honest inquiry and not some cease and desist ultimatum?

In fact, they could literally not respond and it would be much better for their PR than this....rant? Instead guys like Bittrex and Gemini showed examples of confidence and leadership and Kraken showed a manchild who refuses to adapt. I find it extremely hilarious.

Also about international organisation...I'm not sure such thing even exists, each country has their own laws and their own bodies responsible for handling companies that deal with their citizens.

That seems like a pretty elaborate path to target someone with ""&gt; $50000"" in cryptocurrency.  I would imagine that there are plenty of other well known targets that can guarantee to be significantly more lucrative given similar effort.

Anti-innovation is on both sides.  Don't fool yourself.  The justification for SegWit was to keep the 1Mb base limit.  It is a hack and a kludge that tricks old nodes.  It was done just because it was an interesting programming problem, not because it was the best solution to scaling.

It causes bad user experiences because of the high fees and delays.  It is hardly a fix for anything.  BTC continues to lose adoption and stifle innovation.  I hardly call that an advancement in technology.

Big blockers are treating the whitepaper as an edict from god that can't be changed.  We just have not reach a point where on-chain scaling does not work.  If we do, testing will identify the point where that happens and will solve the issues long before it becomes a problem.

I'm into long term investing for the most part although I'm not against swing trading when the market is clearly in the bull direction. I mostly play with top 100 coins, but to be fair I'm only about 40% allocated to BTC currently so that makes me a pretty big risk taker.

"**Robust control**

In control theory, robust control is an approach to controller design that explicitly deals with uncertainty. Robust control methods are designed to function properly provided that uncertain parameters or disturbances are found within some (typically compact) set. Robust methods aim to achieve robust performance and/or stability in the presence of bounded modeling errors.

The early methods of Bode and others were fairly robust; the state-space methods invented in the 1960s and 1970s were sometimes found to lack robustness, prompting research to improve them.

Crypto has largely gone mainstream in 2017, at least when it comes to awareness, and there are countless discussion venues on the internet. Hell even r/cryptocurrency is nearly as big as r/bitcoin and the discussions there are far more interesting then either rbtc or rbitcoin. However Roger seems to be stuck in 2013 and think that a largely irrelevant subreddit holds the keys to the future of Bitcoin and the world.  He's as delusional as Theymos in that regard.

"People are used to use at most two decimals for their fiat currencies. I think if you start messing with multiple sub denominations between Bitcoin and all the possibilities all the way down to satoshis you're going to get new users confused.

And I think is more democratic because there's no standardization body in Bitcoin because it is supposed to be decentralized, so I think developers should not decide what is the default denomination and use what the protocol understands and works with and that unit is satoshis. People will always understand that more satoshis means more wealth.

Another think to avoid confusion would be to add a selector for a denomination in the Send tab of the wallet application, so it allows to do: 'Send 10 \[sat, bits, bitcoins, etc\] to 1xxxx' so people don't have to worry to convert between denominations. Right now I think wallets only allow to chose a unique denomination for all the wallet functions.

Crypto has not achieved mass adoption yet so I would not worry about confusing existing users now, I would worry about confusing new ones. But at the end you can't control what developers do and education is the only way to get people to agree.

That's why I think default should be satoshis \(I agree not typing them as SAT or it would appear as a price ticker for another currency, more like Sat. or sat.\) and then let in the hands of the users to choose other denomination if they want to.

"From the article: 

n 2014, Amazon applied for a patent that would help de-anonymize crypto currency transactions and then sell that information to law enforcement and government agencies. Although Bitcoin was never meant to be totally private, the patent looks to remove almost all levels of anonymity from crypto currency transactions if possible.

The patent explains a ‚Äústreaming digital marketplace‚Äù where data points form different sources are used to pinpoint users identities. Below is a quote from the patent application.

One example is a data stream that publishes or includes global bitcoin transactions (or any crypto currency transaction). These transactions are completely visible to each participant in the network. The raw transaction data may have little meaning to a customer unless the customer has a way to correlate various elements of the stream with other useful data. For example, a group of electronic or internet retailers who accept bitcoin transactions may have a shipping address that may correlate with the bitcoin address. The electronic retailers may combine the shipping address with the bitcoin transaction data to create correlated data and republish the combined data as a combined data stream. A group of telecommunications providers may subscribe downstream to the combined data stream and be able to correlate the IP (Internet Protocol) addresses of the transactions to countries of origin. Government agencies may be able to subscribe downstream and correlate tax transaction data to help identify transaction participants.

*The purpose here would be to combine data from different retailers and look for common points, such as a shipping address or IP logs and then start to put together a picture of the real identity of the person using Bitcoin or any other crypto currency.*",1524132086
"How do you see this not as a problem?

&gt;This means that the Bitcoin Cash blockchain would grow by 178 GB each day

My Bitcoin full node needs around 500 GB bandwidth monthly with only 50 connections. Most Isps and server provider use a fair traffic system or otherwise charge you the exact traffic you actually consumed. For example, my provider did shut me down for going above 1.5 TB. The  	consequence was that my provider did add to their TOS that you are not allowed to run crypto tools anymore(e.g. Bitcoin...) Unlimited/fair traffic doesn't mean they will accept 100 TB transfer a month from you. Can you point me to a hoster that would provide me with 100% certainty close to 100 TB transfer below 50$? Digitalocean would charge the hell out of you.",1524132023

The reason people are giving you strange answers is because what you are saying doesn't sound very logical. First of all you cannot send money to blockchain.com to exchange it into bitcoin. If with $$$ you mean bitcoin, then yes, you could send it to a wallet on blockchain.com. However you could also just immediately transfer it  to coinbase to exchange it into cash if that is what you mean.

We would however not recommend storing your coins on coinbase or blockchain.com, as you will not be the owner of your own private keys. It is smarter to use a wallet such as Electrum in combination with a hardware wallet like the Ledger. 


For the fees you will have to be aware that for every transaction on the bitcoin network you need to pay a miner's fee. For the fees that coinbase charges we suggest you look into this yourself.

"Is the plan for Bitcoin Cash to have so many sub-cent transactions that the fee will pay for the eventual security through Proof-of-Work? If the network cannot be secured by businesses and individuals running large mining farms, then what will stop governments from entering with their confiscated money and controlling a large part of the hash-power, as they can waste money for whatever reason. Corporations and individuals won't be running mining if they will incurs losses over a long period.

100 transactions = 1 dollar at 1 cent.
100,000 transactions = 1,000 dollar at 1 cent.
1 million transactions = 10,000 dollar at 1 cent.

So with each block having 1 million transactions, that would be 6 million an hour and 144 million transactions a day. VISA does average 150 million a day, so the number is fairly realistic in terms of human usage.

Looking at the latest Bitcoin Cash blocks, the average is around 2.44 kB pr. transaction. This is due to a lot of large transactions, and they drag the average very high since there are almost no Cash transactions yet (around 8-12 a minute).

If that continue to be average, each block would be 2,383 MB (2.4GB).

But it is more likely with 1 input and 2 output and it will stay around 225 bytes which is normal for Bitcoin / Bitcoin Cash.

So to get $10K in transaction fee value, one block would be 225,000,000 bytes (1,000,000 * 225), or 214.6 MB pr. block.

At that rate, it would require 31 GB a day in storage. 217 GB a week, and 930 GB a month. 11.4 TB a year. That should be doable, with a 4TB disk costing $90 today. So $270 a year pr. full node a year in storage investment, not counting backups or disk failures and increased storage pr. dollar.

There are around 2000 public Bitcoin Cash nodes today, so investment in storage will be $540,000 a year for those nodes. These are just public nodes, and Bitcoin got almost 10K. So the number is likely in millions of dollars a year in storage.

The recent planned hard fork to support 32MB blocks will be able to contain ""only"" 149,130 transactions pr. block.

That will equal to $1,491 in fees pr. block if maxed out. And that is with fee at 1 cent, Roger think that is too much.

At the moment there is no earnings on fees for Bitcoin Cash for miners, as each block gives between 3 cent and a couple of dollar in fee earnings.

Right now the earnings for a block with BCH price at $884.56 is $11,057, which is about what one would earn with 1 million transaction blocks.

Right now the collected fee pr. block on Bitcoin is about $150 to $3500, varies a lot.",1524127454

"Digital money is more practical now than physical money.  There are tons of articles pointing toward growing adoption.  It's coming and soon. New tech will succeed this year that will make payments on a large scale realistic.

What could speed things up big time is a world wide financial collapse with US fiat leading the way.  Hyperinflation results from currency devaluation - see Venezuela. If ( or more likely when) that happens, crypto prices will climb with the demand with silver and gold taking the rest of the flight.  Adoption would have to follow, rapidly, because cryptos will be where the buying power resides.  Just look at the debt everywhere if you doubt this could happen.",1524127319
"It confuses me too.  Honestly, I got into it once when I was in the research chemical business.  Someone used BTC to buy something from me one time, so I set up a wallet &amp; used my BTC to buy something off the original Silk Road.  If I hadn't been using stimulants I wouldn't have had the attention span to bother learning, haha.  The wallet took 3 days to download &amp; it was all very complicated.

I still don't understand how it all works.  What if you buy a ton of BTC &amp; your computer crashes &amp; dies?  Where does it go if your wallet thingy was on that computer?  

And now there's talk of Bitcoin or Bitpay or whatever banning kratom, nootropics &amp; other things that aren't even illegal.  If that happens it will be no better than any other payment method out there.  The advantage of BTC for me is the freedom to do what you want with it.  Other payment processors already have too many restrictions &amp; it's ridiculous.  (But I don't know whether that applies to BitCOIN or just BitPAY...whatever that is.  Just know I read about all these new restrictions &amp; felt disgusted by them).  The last thing cryptocurrency needs is a bunch of regulations &amp; bans.  ",1524127224

",1524127152
IMO. Let's Bitcoin stay the way it is right now. Why do we need to point out their mistakes?,1524127152
"1 - Team behind the coin is on their website, sunerok is the lead dev - watch some interviews with him and you'll understand he is a solid guy. I think he if also quite highly regarded in the crypto community - except of the reddit monero shillers.
Maybe you can watch these:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCOcwwTiRhs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFXkJjgPlII 

2. Not sure about it, but I think at least sunerok is - he also is advising other proejcts on their privacy side. I believe he had some IT security company before he started working on verge

3. The developement is funded solely from the community - mostly donations. I believe that guys in the team have some amount from the early mining days to go on even without ) But there was crowdfund for everything important - binance support for example, now this pornhub adoption.

4. Code comes from Bitcoin/Peercoin which they forked

5. I believe long-term goals is to make stable crypocurrency with possibility of a mass adoption with privacy features if needed. Even though there is public ledger even with Wraith off - you still have I2P and TOR which hides your location - they do not want the transactions to be untrackable if wanted - so it can be used for the commercial use

6.  Short term goals are probably better implementation and more businesses to adopt. They are also working on RING-CT, moneros main privacy feature to implement it. Ledger/Trezor support - IOS wallet and many more things - check the roadmap

7. I believe the main intention was to make it as decentralized as possible - thats why there is multialgo for mining - which caused the recent timestamp exploit everyone talks about - but was fixed in merely 2 days - which is fast. They can't just fort it whenever they want without informing comunity beforehand.

8. - Wallets are available on the website. I personally use Androids Tor wallet with QR codes to send xvg

9. - There is discord/telegram groups, but they are so full of uneducated people is 2edge sword .. I think there is currently no legit way to get these questions answered - too many toxic people

10. - The best thing - hm - probably fast and cheap transactions at the moment, and their goal .. I believe every other feature will improve with time 

11. - Probably the reputation ? Which is completely misunderstood ..

12. - The privacy is differenct from monero/zcash which tries to hide the transaction themselves - Verge main goal is to hide your physical location and obfuscate your IP adresses so you are not trackable. You can also fake the transaction with wraith protocol (stealth adresses) - thats so called private ledger.  This is much better solution for mass adoption - even though it might be less private than Monero (which leaked IP addresses and recent paper on RingCT showed it can be tracable in quite many cases), because what would happen if you want to buy something with Monero - what about warranty, how do you prove you bought it when you do not have proof of transaction? 

13. - Not sure if that is the question but yes :D 

I dont know, there is much more to every point - maybe try to do your own research. One thing is they also partnered with Tokenpay - another coin which will have their own exchange, creditcard and many mroe thing - sunerok is their security advisor. So I think there are many things to come this year and I hope it will prove these idiots who take care only about their own investment - spreading lies or half-baked info.

"&gt; It doesn't. Again, the attacker sends T1 directly to the miners (as everybody should do). The listening nodes would see only T2, and would not see T1 until it is confirmed.

That's not how bitcoin node software works, though (at least not BU or ABC or XT).  Most miners run ABC and a few run BU.  When the miner receives the transaction, he will then broadcast it to all the nodes he's connected to.  So yes the listening nodes _will_ see it.

You can argue that the miners might modify their software to keep transactions secret, but that falls under deviant behaviour which I also addressed in my previous post.   

&gt; Again, that only detects double spends sent to the non-mining relay network. 

That's not true. If the website notices that a transaction from its mempool gets replaced by a conflicting transaction in a solved block (because that TX was hidden), then the website will report this as a successful double-spend  At least I think that's how it works, but let's ask /u/dagurval to be sure.

&gt; And the fact that no one is trying double-spend attacks now does not mean anything. 

If you look at the website, you'll see pages and pages of ""double-spend"" attempts.  I think a lot of those were done by /u/dgenr8 when preparing for his SV Tokyo talk, but what it suggested is that a few second head start is enough in most cases for the first TX to win in most cases, and also that few if any miners were doing RBF.  

&gt; There is very few commerce with BCH, and even less (maybe none) trusting 0-conf.

Yes, fair point.  Right now 0-conf is too weak, but I think once we have Tom Harding's double-spend relaying deployed and merchant software uses this properly, it will be acceptable for low-value in-person transactions.

There's no such volunteers in Bitcoin at the moment though.,1524126584
"It's feasible and should be necessary eventually. Imagine if 1 BCH was worth 1 million USD, then 1 satoshi per byte would be pretty expensive (if people were still comparing BCH to USD at that point).

Fees are actually nothing but more input than output in a transaction. If someone uses input addresses for a total of 0.1 BCH but only specifies output addresses for a total of 0.01 BCH it means the miner constructing the block is allowed to take the remaining 0.09 BCH for himself (it becomes part of the fees gathered in the block).

So a transaction actually doesn't have a set fee per byte, it is just something that the client uses for calculation. So it's completely acceptable to use 0.01 sat/byte or 0.000124 sat/byte as transaction fee today. However, miners are free to refuse any transaction in the block and many simply don't include those with less than 1 sat/byte.

It makes sense right now when 1 BCH is worth less than 1000 USD since otherwise it would be too cheap for an attacker to fill an entire block with spam transactions.

However when the day comes, when BCH is worth 20k USD or more, miners need to start accepting transactions with fees of less than 1 sat/byte.

Personally I think it would be reasonable to make it so that miners adapt their minimum accepted fee depending on the size of the block. The first 1 MB of a block would accept 0.01 sat/byte in fees, then the second MB would require 0.02 sat/byte, the third 0.04 sat/byte, fifth 0.08 sat/byte and so on.

The first 100 KB could even accept 0 sat/byte in fees to provide the option of completely free transactions with very low priority. The original Bitcoin protocol actually had part of the 1 MB block reserved for transactions with 0 fee.

I think it would be wise to implement these increasing fees depending on the block size sooner rather than later so that when the day comes to accept less-than 1 sat/byte it won't be too late and miners simply refuse to do it. Then we might be stuck with high transaction fees forever... 1 sat/byte is only a low transaction fee as long as 1 BCH isn't worth several thousands of USD.",1524126567

Yes, but it is still going to be small. Maybe $0.25 or so.

&gt; If that's the case, is it better to reuse old addresses so if I bought that 0.01 100 times I would have a lower fee as it just one address not 100 addresses?

&gt;I understand what Bitcoin Cash is, and you can do the exact same things on Bitcoin that you can do with Bitcoin Cash.¬†

No, you can't. Segwit weakens the incentive structure and is effectively an irremovable blemish. 0-conf doesn't really work on BTC for several reasons. And the blocksize cannot ""just be raised."" You need the miners to go along, and why would they voluntarily de-hedge themselves by making BTC more like BCH? The two experiments need to run their course, as Jihan and Haipo said.

&gt;I don't like Bitcoin Cash because of how centralized it is.¬†

Allowing Bitcoin adoption to happen naturally without artificially limiting capacity is the fastest path to decentralization. Growth brings more miners into the space and makes it harder for governments to attack. Non-mining software exerts no power over the network, and decentralization that isn't decentralization of *power* isn't a decentralization worthy of the name.

"Guys, I think that there is an element of truth to what you both say. The problem is that the statistics that we are all looking at aren‚Äôt that accurate.
Btc dominance is a factor of the value of all alts, many of which have completely false valuations etc. The statistic was perhaps more relevant when there were only 5-20 alts?
I hold a small portfolio of most major alts, and I regularly check their value in usd and btc. From my own personal experience, and in Btc valuation, they mooned faster than btc in the last 1/4 of 2017, and fell harder than btc first 1/4 2018.
The wider economy associates btc with crypto. Until some alts have genuine use cases and are widely used, no alt can survive a btc crash.",1524121676
