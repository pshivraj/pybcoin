BTC has had many hard forks? Please list three.

As far as I recall only BIP 50 was a hardfork.

But the point is contention. A *block size upgrade* on BTC will always be contentious, because BTC has ejected almost everyone who supports block size increases from the community.

"&gt;I can't make sense of what you wrote.
&gt;RBF has absolutely nothing to do with it

RBF is a mechanism for transaction replacement, a feature built into the original design of bitcoin which enables a specific style of contracts. Contracts can obviously be written in other ways, but contract schemes that rely on transaction replacement require replaceable transactions.

&gt; That's a non sequitur, scripting in BCH is actually going to be richer than in BTC in a few days. 

Speaking of non sequiturs, what do re-enabled opcodes have to do with the inability to use replaceable nLockTime based contracts when transactions are not reliably replaceable?

&gt; There's only so much you can do with a CLTV.

CLTV is a relatively recent addition to Script which can enable some contract types, but not the form under discussion.

"A significant portion of the bitcoin community wanted to hard fork to raise block size. A significant portion of the developers objected to that, and shit ensued. Two bitcoin developers, namely Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn released another implementation of bitcoin protocol, called bitcoin xt, and this implementation was programmed to raise the block size if 75% of the miners agreed to it via their vote. The small block proponents responded fiercely against it, and plenty discussion was being had both here and at bitcointalk. 

As you can see, things were going as they should up until that point, because afterwards r/bitcoin top mod, who also owns bitcointalk and a number of other bitcoin related platforms, started censoring the big blocker side of the debate, and said that promoting a hard fork which lacked community consensus was a bannable offense. Of course, he didn't give his reasoning as to how we were gonna achieve consensus if the discussion was censored...

Lots of people got pissed off, and they migrated to the other sub that shall not be named, also to other subs as well like bitcoin_xt, bitcoin_uncensored etc. In the end, btc sub gained the most attraction, and naturally all the big blockers who were banned eventually ended up there. 

This went on for two years or so, and both subs were about bitcoin. However, a developer named amaury sechet deployed a hard fork to increase the block size to 8mb with his client, and the new fork chain didn't die. Seeing as this new chain was what they always wanted, rbtc folks flocked to this new chain and started promoting that one instead. 

Of course, all the people in rbtc were bitter about this whole drama, as they were censored in their community for their beliefs, and they were all die hard bitcoin fans. Since they clearly thought that raising the blocksize was the way to go, they started spreading the idea that the new chain had as much, if not more claim to the bitcoin name as the bitcoin we know. Two communities were already at a cold war, but this behaviour made it an open war. This is the reason you see this drama on both subs.

There should be more projects which offer long-term investments. Because only financial pyramides can tell that you'll immediately become a millionaire after investing. It's my opinion.

"&gt;edit: this is a stupid thing to debate they are marginally more decentralised and the impacts of the recent block increases haven't even been realized on any significant time scale.

It is not marginally more decentralised, they have 60+% more nodes.

If you guys really cared about decentralisation you should research what is the reason why ETH users run more nodes than BTC one.. it could be critical to increase BTC nodes numbers.

&gt;&amp;gt; What you discribe is path discovery once your channel know the network topology.

&gt;This is no different than the bitcoin p2p topology. In Bitcoin network if I send you a payment I do no need to know the entire graph. My wallet or node is already bootstrapped with well connected peers. Why do you think this is different? 

It is totally different.

A onchain Transactions is broadcasted to all nodes the same.

You nodes just need to send its tx to the node it is connected to, easy (typically to the 8 nodes it is connected too). No path finding.

With LN your channel must find channel that have a path to your destination, have enough liquidity and proper fees. Those characteristics are higly dynamic.

For that your channel need to know the status of **all** channel each time it request routing. (It create a huge load on all channels because they have to broadcast their status for every payment made on the network)

This doesn’t scale.

&gt;&amp;gt; This is a trusted set up.

&gt;in what way?

Because you trust another hub/channel/serves to route you Payment.

No, go back and read. I said that ETH transactions are counted differently than BTC transactions and they are not equivalent. The USD value was an aside.

If BTC goes bull run and slows to a crawl, I’d think BCH would like to position itself as a front runner for mode of transfer. How is this any different than BTC and blockstream working on lightning network? Is it 100% needed at this time? Does it work well? Is it tested and safe? Developers need to pilot test and refine ideas to prepare for the hopeful volumes of the future. It’s a marathon not a sprint. Current stats and data are almost arbitrary, it’s like day 2 of 100 in crypto imho. In a few years the Btc BCH infighting will be a forgotten and immature memory. Both might be gone, both more likely may still exist for different use cases, and something altogether new may be dominating well beyond anything “bitcoin.” Its early amigo.",1525846342
"Just because you don’t like something doesn’t mean it’s not factual.

I could give you a litany of reasons why everyone should have bitcoin, but I won’t. I’ll save my time and energy. 

You’re right. Bitcoin is useless. So useless that it went from a value of $0.09 to over $9000 in just ten years. It’s so pointless that it is traded for goods and services around the world. It is so fallible that no single government knows how to treat it, handle it, or stop it from undermining the hierarchical structure that has been in place for a millennia. 

Don’t buy bitcoin.
 #1 it’s just some computer money that people around the world agree has value, 

#2 it’s gonna crash again, proof: it already went all the way from $0.09 to $20k and the down to $9k what a total scam.

# 3 it’s so incredibly inconvenient to use with my cellphone, there’s only like 15 mobile wallets and who even has a cellphone anyways.

So really, just don’t buy it. I mean who wants privacy from the banks or government or whatever. How will they know what I’m spending my money on if I don’t have to ask permission to use my money first.

You’re so right about being jumped on for the whole only being on for two days thing.  You clearly jumped into a subreddit with an intent to be a contributor of well thought out content. You weren’t acting like a fucking cunt at all.

The reason I spent the  time to write this is because:

"That's arguable.  The SEC considers spreading false or misleading information about a company to be market manipulation.  Bitcoin is not a company so, and I am pretty sure that even the SEC doesn't consider Bitcoin it's responsibility but assuming they did and it was that would mean they should ban most of reddit and basically everyone who has ever posted in a troll box from trading, or charge them with a crime maybe??

Even if US authorities were insane enough to try and prevent market manipulation of cryptos and by some miracle of biblical proportions actually succeeded in doing so across all exchanges they had jurisdiction over not everywhere would and these are global markets.  On top of that there are numerous decentralized markets in various stages between planning and fully functional.  

I would like to argue that it should be a truly free market where the will of nations have no say in, but it's a moot point because no matter how much you or anyone else would like to regulate how people behave in these markets you can't.  It's just not possible.

There are a lot of parallels with religion. I'm happy for people to believe whatever they want to believe, and I'm genuinely happy if their beliefs make them happy. But when they come around and start trying to teach kids that evolution is a lie or that sexual orientation is a choice, then I have a problem with it.

In other markets, TA people keep to themselves. They understand that not everybody subscribes to their theories, so they tend to only discuss them with like-minded people, akin to having religious discussions or preaching in a church. But in crypto, for some reason, the TA folk have become zealots that loudly preach their theories as gospel truth at every corner. It's understandable that this bothers some people.

Regarding the teasing about portfolios, that might just be a /biz/ thing spilling over.

"**Bretton Woods system**

The Bretton Woods system of monetary management established the rules for commercial and financial relations among the United States, Canada, Western Europe, Australia, and Japan after the 1944 Bretton-Woods Agreement. The Bretton Woods system was the first example of a fully negotiated monetary order intended to govern monetary relations among independent states. The chief features of the Bretton Woods system were an obligation for each country to adopt a monetary policy that maintained its external exchange rates within 1 percent by tying its currency to gold and the ability of the IMF to bridge temporary imbalances of payments. Also, there was a need to address the lack of cooperation among other countries and to prevent competitive devaluation of the currencies as well.

"**Legitimacy (political)**

In political science, legitimacy is the right and acceptance of an authority, usually a governing law or a régime. Whereas ""authority"" denotes a specific position in an established government, the term ""legitimacy"" denotes a system of government—wherein ""government"" denotes ""sphere of influence"". An authority viewed as legitimate often has the right and justification to exercise power. Political legitimacy is considered a basic condition for governing, without which a government will suffer legislative deadlock(s) and collapse.

"I like how you instantly question me just because I'm new to Reddit. As if my length of time on Reddit has anything to do with what I said.

Let me ask you this. What do you use to buy your bitcoins? Once you buy them, what are you using to compare their value with? And when you decide to sell them, what are you selling them for? Are you rich because you have 1000 Bitcoin? Or are you rich because you have 1000 Bitcoin and one Bitcoin is worth $10,000?

The US dollar can be used almost anywhere in the world. If I go to Mexico, I can use US dollars at every taco stand, bar, brothel, or taxi.

What about competing cryptos? You have hundreds of them. Soon, you'll have government backed crypto. You already have gold backed crypto.

Like I said, Bitcoin is worth about as much as gold on WoW. Right now, WoW gold is worth more than Venezuelan currency. But to the majority of people, WoW gold is worthless.

It can be argued that paper money isn't worth the paper the ink is printed on. It's true. Just like Bitcoin isn't worth the 0's and 1's that make it up. Things only have the value that sormone else is willing to give it.

A super rare stamp might be worth a million dollars, but if nobody is willing to pay a million dollars, what's it's true value? A Bitcoin is literally nothing. But for now, people are willing to pay for it. So for now, that's the value. When push comes to shove, the only thing with true value is food and clean water. Invest in water.

"&gt; e context I work in B2B software sales and studied economics in college. I was going over some old Econ text books and the simple explanation of a “service” I think fits really well with my understanding of crypto currency.
&gt; 
&gt; I think it would also be helpful to explain the definition of a service in the way economists understand them.
&gt; 
&gt; Is it useful? Is it scarce? Can it’s ownership rights be transferred?
&gt; 
&gt; (Goods are the same with the extra stipulation that it be material.)
&gt; 
&gt; While we all would like to consider cryptocurrency as money which it can be used as there are other ways crypto currencies are useful, meaning they are beyond restriction and confiscation and they verify transactions. A dollar bill cannot do this.
&gt; 
&gt; The quote from the textbook that I’m reading (Principles of Economics by James Gemmel and Howard L. Balsley) that got me thinking is an analogy about a baseball player’s skill as a service.
&gt; 
&gt; “Although a baseball player’s skill, itself, cannot be transferred, rights to the use of that skill can be bought and sold. Therefore, they are transferable. The skill of a baseball player cannot be seen. Only the product of the skill can be observed.”
&gt; 
&gt; Baseball player = Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcoin is transferable The product of the skill (decentralization) can be observed.

"One of the biggest advantages to LN aside from extremely cheap fees is that it allows for instant transactions. 0-conf in any cryptocurrency is inherently risky because if it isn't already in a block (and even if it is that block can be orphaned), whoever mines the next block gets to decide which transaction to include. Now you can try to determine which transaction is the ""original""
 but how do you prove that? If I broadcast two transactions at the same time, it's entirely possible that the payment processor's node will see one transaction as the ""original"" whereas the mining pool that mined the next block sees the double spend as the ""original"". Bitcoin cash can never hope to provide the kind of instant and trustless transactions on chain that LN provides with Bitcoin. It's fundamentally impossible to do that securely with any blockchain by definition.

Bitcoin Cash is simply an older version of Bitcoin that was modified to change the rules around what constitutes a valid block, and change the difficulty algorithm. One thing you'll hear is that because they don't have replace by fee that you can't do a double spend, this is nonsense as replace by fee is something that the original transaction has to opt into. If a merchant doesn't accept transactions that opt into replace by fee, the double spend problem is the same as Bitcoin Cash.

You can see that this isn't true for yourself with this convenient website to view real double spend transactions on Bitcoin Cash.

"You aren't going to stop fractional reserve, or anything else. Once you have tokens and smart contracts, you can do whatever you want, and Bitcoin has that capability.

I think your key phrase there is ""Push transactions off chain."" You should build the best chain you can and let the market do what the hell ever they want with their off chain tie ins. The underlying coin doesn't give a crap if a group outside of the chain wants to introduce credit to amplify their spending through fractional reserve. That's a risk that participants of that group undertake. If you push the transactions off chain though and leave get chain incapable of functioning at scale then you force everyone to undertake that risk and in the case of failure the coin fails catastrophically because it was relying on that second layer in order to function at all.",1525838517

Bitcoin core has never had a bug as serious as the multiple bugs from those idiotic copycats. How dumb do you have to be to introduce so many screwups when 99% of it is just copying Bitcoin Core?

"I don’t get why anyone says “better technology” in reference to bitcoin and after. It’s delusional at best when you think compared to the past technology in banking and money. Bitcoin is leaps and bounds ahead. It is the innovation. It is the better technology. 

In the past even with the card systems it started out as 3-5 business days for clearing. Today, you see the money come out but the merchant does not get paid until 21 days later. Or when we were on checking systems. That was 2 weeks no matter what to clear and overdraft was a huge money maker. Better yet being on a cash system. Deposit one day and it didn’t show in your account for 3 days. That’s why people mainly held cash on hand vs having a bank account. This is all financial tech that dates back to the 80’s. 

Satoshi created a basic protocol. It’s no frills but has science built into it. Block times of 10 minutes is long enough for peers to sync with each other. This time is very tolerable. But shorter times would mean peers would have to have better equipment just to stay in sync. A whisper broadcast network is justified by minimizing collusion between peers. A predictable coin count and release schedule. This is very important. Because not only does it serve as a reward to participate. It also makes it easier to identify who is cheating. 2016 block difficulty retargets to dissuade coin creators from inflating the supply quickly for an extended period of time. Or in the event of a 51% attack the 49% of miners can go offline and blocks will take longer real time for each one to be produced. This was the breakthrough. 

All others are just a derivative on this concept of what Satoshi created. Lastly, by Satoshi leaving established bitcoin as the one. It forces humans to deal with its own nature of greed and corruption. As long as you have more honest nodes Bitcoin can last for centuries. Anyone can talk or lobby all they want. In the end it comes down to the code that is running in consensus with each other. There is no one person or group that can influence the direction of what bitcoin will become. 

The other coins will all succumb to the same fate as fiat. Because they all rely on trust of someone. They all rely on influence to get them in places. And this maybe the reason bankers and VC’s flock to them so easily. But in the end the kings get replaced with a better king. Bitcoin has no king to replace. 

Markets are the weakest point to all of this. Because well funded players can and are trying to justify other coins as better by price performance. But this is normal. Every reserve currency that gets replaced is done in parallel with the new currency replacing it. This time takes between 20 to 30 years. Or the birth of 2 generations. Humans will need a period of time to adjust. This is now happening as we speak. We are living it in real time too. 

Now what solidifies bitcoin over others. Look to the past when the internet was in the same situation. You had competing implements. Some were backed by large corporate interest. Why did we pick the one we use today. It was the World Wide Web. After that the other internet protocols just faded to irrelevancy. So LN is the moment of truth for the whole industry. ",1525837530

"&gt; There are actual products, ones that I work with clients on, that involve no cryptocurrencies. It’s not a debate.

The whole point of the Blockchain is the decentralization of trust where the incentives and punishments are balanced to decentralize control.  Without those incentives (crypto) it just becomes an innovative distributed database but really doesn't posses the characteristics that make a blockchain so compelling.

"&gt; Now, when Alice does some work worth 1 millibitcoin, *she asks Bob to create and sign a new version of the refund transaction*. Version two of the transaction spends 1 millibitcoin to Alice and the other 99 back to Bob; it does not have a locktime, so Alice can sign it and spend it whenever she wants. (But she doesn’t do that immediately.)

This is an example of Satoshi's intended design for smart contracts on bitcoin. It demonstrates the reason he included transaction replacement as an intentional feature in the earliest versions of his bitcoin client. Unfortunately, with the adversion to RBF, and presumably other forms of transaction replacement, prevalent within the BCH user community, nSequenceNumber/nLockTime-based smart contracts are off the table.",1525836425

"Well imo you can't reliably track deposits to a big waallet form end users.   
  
So each user is given a wallet address which is unique to them.  
  
This is fine and dandy, but the problem arises when someone other user has to withdraw said crypto currency.  
  
Since for exchange their amount is stored on multiple potentially thousands/millions of wallet, it would either   
  1. Find a wallet address which is big enough to service that request. Kind of in the fashion of best fit algorithm. If there is no such wallet to service such request, send funds from different wallets to the withdrawal address to service their request.  
  
  2. Consolidate funds, i.e. as soon as deposit comes to the designated user address, send the funds to a wallet which contains all the funds of said crypto currency of the exchange. Now whenever a withdrawal request is made, only funds from that wallet need to be withdrawn.  
  
In the second case the transaction fee is increased since with involves an additional step of sending from exchange wallet -&gt; withdrawal address.  
  
This doesn't take into account hot/cold wallets maintained by exchange.  
  
Well I guess it wasn't a question worth asking since it was pretty self explanatory.  
  
My real question I guess is how they recover these costs plus operationing and capital expenditure. That is where trade fee and withdrawal fee should come into place. ",1525836120

"&gt; Memo was released on April 15th, 2018
&gt; 
&gt; This is from your link btw - yes, they are rising...
&gt; And you're right, the numbers don't lie

Zoom out. They're not rising, certainly not by any significant degree. They're flat and much lower than the spikes we've seen over the past few months.

&gt;Again from your own link - transaction value.


Again zoom out. You're cherry picking time frames.

&gt;So far it doesn't seem that way. Info was accurate :)

Lol, not really.

&gt;Can you link a chart or something showing that Segwit is indeed outperforming BCH? Based on your other comments on statistics I simply can't take your word for it. I tried googling it but came up empty - not sure exactly how to find the info.

https://blog.bitmex.com/the-segwit-transaction-capacity-increase-update/

Easy to just compare the numbers directly as well. Lookup Segwit chart and compare against BCH. Not sure why you think I'm lying about this. I haven't lied about anything. You're the one cherry picking time frames to make it look like BCH is rising.

&gt;My claim was that no development has come about since the Segwit release.

Dude, what? Go look at github yourself. I'm not going to hold your hand for every little piece of data.

&gt;Can you show me what is being worked on for BTC? The LN is a separate thing with its own developers, so I'll comment on that next.

It's not separate, it's part of the BTC ecosystem of development. Also, many more things are being actively developed. Schnorr is a big one that comes to mind.

&gt;The LN, still in beta after 3 years of development, is still baby tiny and baby new. I would explain its pitfalls, but I'll let these guys explain it. First watch the video of Roger Ver betting the other guy that his LN transaction wouldn't work

&gt;.. I won't spoil it for you.

&gt;Start here - LN 1
&gt;LN 2
&gt;u/Falkvinge
&gt; - Lightning Network


These videos are FUD and propaganda. I'm not even going to dignify this shit with a response. Falkvinge is a hack, btw. 

&gt;I have no idea who the guy is but he, pretty accurately I might add, hit the nail on the head as to what Blockstream was able to pull off.

Dude, what are you talking about. Molyneux is a crazy person, firstly. He's a holocaust denier and all around white-supremacist asshole. 

Again, not even going to dignify your claim with a rebuttal here, what you're saying is unproven nonsense.

&gt;If not, show me a proof of the fact that on chain scaling won't work. This is the main propaganda coming from Blockstream and r/bitcoin. If its not true, prove that it isn't true. Otherwise its simply hearsay to promote the use of alternate solution. Needed because the BTC has been crippled.

Run the fucking math yourself, I'm not going to walk you through every little piece here. Gather the data on how many transactions people make globally. Divide by 4200. That's how big each block needs to be (in MB). See the issue yet?

&gt;Segwit doesn't solve the problem that exists. Otherwise there wouldn't be a need for the LN. Segwit was only implemented in order to make the LN, a for profit development, viable for the BTC chain.

Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Segwit was developed for a number of reasons, primarily to fix and future-proof signature data, transaction malleability and increase the block size. LN is secondary to all this. 

&gt;I appreciate the benefit of the doubt in this scenario. I'll go ahead and confirm that I have not participated in the downvote brigade. I haven't downvoted anything you've said. On top of that, I can't say that censorship, at some level, does or doesn't exist here on r/btc, as I can't experience it being a BCH supporter.

I appreciate it.

&gt;I know that it exists on r/bitcoin for the same reasons. Again, to each his own. Just know that participating in either sub is up to you, whether censorship occurs is not. There is censorship on r/bitcoin in the form of banning users for life for simply discussing BCH in a positive light. Which, whether you like it or not is technically Bitcoin discussion. All forks of Bitcoin should be considered Bitcoin discussion.

That's not censorship, that's moderation. /r/Bitcoin is a discussion forum related to Bitcoin, not alts. 

&gt;But here's the best part - you are always welcome on Memo.cash and/or Blockpress.com. Both of these social networks are open source and free of censorship due to being built on the BCH blockchain. You'll find me there easily under WonderBud.

Good to know.

The bottom line, as far as I see it, is you are grossly misinformed about Segwit, Core, Blockstream and scaling. You've seemingly drank the kool-aid, so to speak. I feel bad because you seem like a nice guy but you should really do some re-thinking on all this imo. Scaling on chain to 8 Billion people simply doesn't work. Blockchains are highly inefficient and this model of scaling is simply not feasible while retaining even a modicum of decentralization. 

There are far better ways to approach this problem. BTC is taking a multi-faceted approach w/ on chain improvements (Segwit + Schnorr are the big ones), additional layers (LN) and block limit increases (likely aiming for 100-200 Mb for LN integration for full 8 billion people at equilibrium). 

Please realize that BCH is promoted by a team of fraudsters. Virtually all the figureheads in the space are known con-artists. Roger is a sociopath and his history of deception and anger issues are well documented. Craig Wright is a fucking liar who tried to claim he was Satoshi (he is definitely not), Jihan is a manipulative opportunist who tried to fuck the space over with covert ASICBoost and manipulated the BCH launch to amass a great deal of coins. These people are con artists, plain and simple. It's not that BCH is a scam (it's not, it's just a piece of software), it's that the people marketing it are selling it as if it were Bitcoin (which is fraud) and claiming that it is somehow possible to scale in this manner. It's not.

I feel bad, man. Please don't get caught up in these people's lies. BCH is not a serious project, it's a pump and dump scheme. The only reason it has any value is that it co-opted the BTC distribution, so it was basically an air-drop for BTC holders. Don't buy the hype.",1525835820

"Yea I generally agree with you.  It was a bit of a rhetorical question, 'cause I'm not sure there is 100&amp;#37; a correct answer. I view forks as a voting mechanism, and I believe it encapsulates much more complexity than people generally give it credit for.  We can be reasonably certain for some forks that there won't be a split, and yet the terminology probably shouldn't change just because some votes are unanimous and some are ambiguous.  I can imagine a future where forks are neither unanimous nor requiring semi\-immediate resolution.  BTC vs BCH is exactly this thing is supposed to work. Calling a fork an 'upgrade' is just another way of saying 'non\-contensious fork', and that sounds eerily familiar.  I do understand the motivation behind it, and that it is well intentioned, but I'm hesitent to accept it.",1525835716
"I do not buy this argument. The community is the sum of its parts. The btc community is very large and distributed. It doesn't all happen in one place. There are multi websites, forums, not to mention social media such as twitter, facebook, instagram. Even reddit, there is more than one subreddit that contains part of the bitcoin community. 

Some people may censor communities they have control of, but that is part of a free market if one owns that certain platform. Being for the free market, I support what one does with what they own. 

Now, we don't get consensus for polling in these markets. We do it by nodes signaling support during an allotted time period. That part cannot be censored in any way. 

So now, all of the developers can only contribute in ways that have agreed upon consensus. Development is open. You don't have consensus to raise the blocksize to 8mb, just like someone else doesn't have consensus to lower the blocksize to 1/2mb. 

Also, it is very apparent that a blocksize increase was not a small change. It brought very passionate discussion with advocates making compelling arguments for both sides.

&gt;You didn't offend me. What offends me is the downvote brigade that ensues in this sub for anyone that questions the viability of BCH.

Not saying you're doing this, but a vast majority of users here are instituting their own vigilante censorship campaign, even though the sidebar clearly says free and open discussion related to ""Bitcoin,"" which is undoubtedly BTC, not BCH at this point in time. The sub is called rBTC, FFS. Yet most here are just BCH shills and anything that goes against the narrative is instantly attacked, without reason.

"Yes, it was made pretty clear on their HELP page:

&gt;Protocol Specification
&gt;
&gt;Each Bitcoin transaction contains a number of output addresses. Normally we see these addresses in their Base58 format. However, in essence they are all just 20-byte binary strings. To save a file on the block chain, it should be divided into 20-byte chunks (adding zeroes to the end of the last chunk if needed). Then, to indicate the end-of-file, one must append the RIPEMD-160 hash of the original file to the list of file chunks. Optionally, one could append a textual comment to the block chain file (right after the hash). The comment should be in UTF-8 encoding and similarly to the file, the comment should be divided into 20-byte chunks. However, the comment does not have to end with its hash. We then concatenate the file chunks, file hash and comment chunks into one array. All of the chunks must then be converted to Base58 format. Finally, a normal Bitcoin transaction has to be made, sending the smallest possible amount of bitcoins to each of the Bitcoin addresses in that array.
&gt;
&gt;Warning! Bitcoin Core wallet might not allow duplicate output addresses in its createrawtransaction RPC. A workaround for this is to apply the named remote procedure on a list of unique addresses at first. Then, after receiving the hex string of the raw transaction, one should search and replace those unique addresses with the intended and possibly duplicate transaction outputs.
&gt;
&gt;Known Issues
&gt;Add support for OP_RETURN messages.
&gt;
&gt;Add support for TXs that contain multiple null-terminated messages.
&gt;
&gt;Make it possible to view only the messages of a certain type, such as images.
&gt;
&gt;Make it possible to decode only the transactions of a user defined address.
&gt;
&gt;Add more hints and helping information under the help tab and into tooltips.

Very neat.

&gt;Bitcoin's block chain is a decentralized database which main purpose is to secure and hold all Bitcoin transactions. It can be used to store other data too. CryptoGraffiti.info allows anyone to easily decode and read arbitrary messages saved into the block chain. No single entity has the power to alter or truncate these messages.
&gt;
&gt;Millions of people using Bitcoin clients are storing the very same data on their computers. It is advisable to use this web service responsibly and with caution because all data saved into the block chain will remain there forever. CryptoGraffiti.info offers a functionality to encode custom messages as bitcoin addresses and import them to the wallet for storing text into block chain.
&gt;
&gt;This service operates automatically and is not moderated because the block chain cannot be moderated. Decoding and encoding is done solely in the user's web browser using JavaScript. The authors of this site are not responsible for the content it displays. Viewer discretion is advised.

&gt;By sending a message that includes a payment to the donation address you are supporting the development of this free web service. Such a donation is added automatically to your message when you use the 'save to block chain' button under the write tab. Messages containing a donation will appear in the feed instantly while non-donators have to wait for the first confirmation of the Bitcoin network.

They changed over from BTC to BCH 6 months ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/76lv0b/cryptograffitiinfo_now_accepts_bitcoin_cash/

Only drawback is that you need to send satoshis to the addresses you're using to build the image/text data. Minimum 546 because that's the dust threshold (feels like we really should lower the dust threshold with today's USD value of BCH). So if you store a 50 kb image on the blockchain it will be *very* costly, a huge transaction and each output needs 546 satoshis... You also burn a lot of satoshis since they go to addresses that nobody own (which I guess could simply be seen as marginally increasing the value of the remaining coins in circulation).

Still, cool to see this. I think I've stumbled over cryptograffiti.info in the past but this is the first time I really understand it, that the images actually go on the blockchain.",1525834297

CryptoCurrency as a Service

For some context I work in B2B software sales and studied economics in college. I was going over some old Econ text books and the simple explanation of a “service” I think fits really well with my understanding of crypto currency. 

I think it would also be helpful to explain the definition of a service in the way economists understand them. 

Is it useful?
Is it scarce?
Can it’s ownership rights be transferred? 

(Goods are the same with the extra stipulation that it be material.)

While we all would like to consider cryptocurrency as money which it can be used as there are other ways crypto currencies are useful, meaning they are beyond restriction and confiscation and they verify transactions. A dollar bill cannot do this. 

The quote from the textbook that I’m reading (Principles of Economics by James Gemmel and Howard L. Balsley) that got me thinking is an analogy about a baseball player’s skill as a service. 

“Although a baseball player’s skill, itself, cannot be transferred, rights to the use of that skill can be bought and sold. Therefore, they are transferable. The skill of a baseball player cannot be seen. Only the product of the skill can be observed.” 

Baseball player = Satoshi Nakamoto
Bitcoin is transferable
The product of the skill (decentralization) can be observed. 

My question I guess is then, could we classify crypto as a service? Why/why not?",1525833637

The subreddits were full of people screaming about not being able to get their coins off of hitBTC. 

How much of this is Binance-related? How much of it is BCN-related? How much of it is related to the other exchanges?

"Hi, can somebody check my understanding on DApps and smart contracts in general? (Please excuse the long winded-ness I’ve only been reading about DApp’s for 3 days now so I’m very new and I’m kind of walking myself through how it works as I’m talking about)

My current understanding of smart contracts says that when any processing takes place on the EVM, there’s a certain amount of gas required for the work done. That gas is paid in a certain amount of ETH, determined by whomever initiated the transaction. 

This makes sense to me in regular ETH transactions and smart contracts. In order to run your code or send your ETH you pay a small fee for the work done to make that transaction happen. Cool. That’s not much different from bitcoin. 

But then when you add DApps and, by extension, tokens into the mix, it gets a little more complicated. 

Let’s say I have a DApp that runs a decentralized version of Runescape or something. Let’s say the DApp uses RUNE as it’s token. 

In the RuneScape DApp’s ico, I set some arbitrary amount to be what RUNE is worth in ETH. People buy a bunch of RUNE using ETH and all of this ETH is stored in the contract itself, which is then itself used as gas to fuel the DApp on the platform. 

The RUNE token allows certain utility on the RuneScape DApp, such as allowing the use of certain spells or dungeons or whatever. This utility can be converted into real-world value (entertainment value in this case), and thus the RUNE token is worth something. The token can be mintable or non-mintable depending on the architecture of the DApp. 

Once people have access to the token and circulation becomes regulated, the market will begin to determine the value of these tokens. At this point you have your fully fledged erc20 token and DApp. 

Is this correct? Or do I have something mixed up somewhere?

Also, how does one ensure that their DApp doesn’t have the gas in the contract expended if no more ETH is being added to the contract in the case of a non-mintable token?

"&gt; Not familiar with BIP125 RBF, but if that implies it is possible for certain transactions to be not-replaceable - then that's not what I am talking about.

BIP125 is the _Bitcoin Improvement Proposal_ which defined the re-enabled transaction replacement strategy in Bitcoin Core software. It is usually what people are referring to, whether they realize it or not, when they talk about RBF on BTC or Core enabling RBF.

BIP125 RBF provides a mechanism by which a sender can signal their preference that their transaction be replaceable and to version the transactions to clarify which should supercede the others. This functionality was part of the original design of Bitcoin, temporarily disabled in a similar fashion and likely with similar cause as the 1MB blocksize cap. The additional requirement of increasing fees resolves the problems that Satoshi's no-fee transaction replacement strategy introduced.

All transaction replacement strategies are unenforceable conventions, including BIP125 RBF and the First-Seen-Safe strategy of the major Bitcoin Cash implementations. It's not even strongly provable were a  miner to break convention - they can always claimed to have seen the alternative transaction first. No miner, on either chain, is actually accountable for following their respective conventions. Making the decision over which of multiple competing transactions will be considered the real history is the purpose of PoW and until sufficient confirmation has occurred the final state is uncertain.

That being so, there is never an implication that any unconfirmed transaction could be not-replaceable, but that applies equally to BTC and BCH.",1525832916

They seem to have a strong belief that bitcoin will not be able to scale long term, and any block size increase is a slippery slope to a future that they are unwilling to allow.

Even though core says they are ok with a hard fork to 2MB (they have it on their own roadmap, just very far in the future), they refuse to prioritize it. They prefer to withhold something that could help the network now, because they don’t trust the community to make educated decisions in the future.

"See I have a mildly ridiculous view on the entire controversy at hand. Truthfully, I think that BTC is the original Bitcoin simply because it had the bigger community and higher following than BCH, and the hardfork left us with what we have. That being said, I truthfully thing that BCH aligns with the original vision drastically closer than BTC in its current state, and that BTC is a business. 

However again, my opinion was formed following the initial listing on coinbase, where I got my first BCH, and after much scrutiny did not sell, and just held onto my coins for awhile. Unfortunately, I did end up selling most of my BTC recently, for BCH. It’s taken awhile for me to form the opinion that I have, however I got into this for the decentralization, not business.

"Yes, the designer of the system left a detailed description which you ignore. Consensus, as determined by greatest proof of work, determines what Bitcoin is. It's. Just. That. Simple.

It doesn't matter if you think it's more bitcoiney. It doesn't matter if you wish it were so, or if you think it's a better version. That is straight up like saying Christianity is the real Judaism or Islam is the real Christianity, to extend your religious analogy. You do all the same mental gymnastics to make your point and ignore the simplest, most direct, and the *only actual criteria.*

Most accumulated work. C o n s e n s u s. That's the DNA. You're just holding a pumpkin and saying it's an orange. Just like the balsamic you buy at the grocery store or the wasabi you've eaten at the Japanese restaurant are knockoffs. Just because you like it, doesn't make it genuine.",1525831402

I think you’re probably a neck beard in mommas basement. 

So you listed the only utility to bitcoin that I see ease of transferring money to another currency.  There is not enough need for that service to justify the average person holding money in bitcoin.  

Maybe if I did a lot of currency exchange or was trying to play the currency markets I could see value in it. 

I see you know enough to know a retailer pays a fee for a card. But I don’t see you mention that bitcoin will automatically cause the retailer to give a discount for paying in bitcoin(?). I mean they should be Saving 1 to 2 % of the sale right?  Why don’t they give discounts like they do for cash(fiat?). Don’t you get hit with fees for exchanging out of bitcoin?  Won’t this fees eat up capital if you need cash?

It’s honestly a joke to say it will kill the banking industry. You’ll still need someone to make loans. If they don’t make money from fees anymore they will just increase interest rates and money/bitcoin will cost more to borrow.  Bitcoin won’t magically make everyone rich.  People will still need credit more then they do retail banking. Retail banking is already a declining business. 

Buffet and Gates are just trying to pass on wisdom. And idiots keep denying that truth. Even if 50 % of the world moves to bitcoin( which will never happen) those 2 will still be among the richest men.

Some people see no charge backs as a negative. Imagine you buy something to find out you got ripped off on product quality and everything about your product is shit or fake, what's your recourse then? 

You are only making a point for travel benefits, but the fact is, if your CC is stolen your CC company can block transactions and even reverse them, whereas if your wallet is stolen and people are able to access it via pin code brute force (assuming you use a pin to access your wallet) well then you lose everything.

If your transaction is not marked as replaceable and has sufficient fees to most likely make it in the next block, then I would have the same confidence on BTC as I would on BCH - perhaps more on account of the higher hash rate.

"The whole market is dropping.  It's not just bitcoin.

If you're worried about the market cap, that's a reflection of BTC's lack of innovation and promotion skills over the last 4 or so years.  The BTC community has been fractured by those controlling the forms and reference code system.  The LN provides a poor user experience and is overly complex from a programming standpoint.

What's more, the toxicity coming out of the BTC forums attacks anyone who does not do exactly what the forum holders wants.  Just look at what happened to Gavin, CoinBase, the miners, and anyone else who wants to make changes.  It's like Scientology.  The smallest infraction results in a full scale attack.  Basically, no rational thinking person would want to build on top of BTC at this point.  These actions say ""STAY AWAY"".

If you want a fix for this, your best bet is to create side chains that don't infringe on BlockStream's patents, get the forum holders to stop the censorship, start encouraging 3rd party developers to jump on board, and re-invigorate your promotion base.

It's all about control. He's probably talking about some BS digital currency issued by the IMF and backed by the 'full faith and credit' of it's member countries. They'll tout it as enviro-friendly and not a waste of energy like other evil cryptos.

The government would probably love to move to a purely electronic fiat system where they can see and monitor and every single transaction. Hopefully this won't ever happen.

"The Bitcoin blockchain is the longest *valid* chain. Who decides what's valid? The Bitcoin community.

Everybody plays nice and nobody gets hurt.

The last option for the community is always a proof-of-work change. The more people in the Bitcoin community agree on a hard fork the less of a problem it is. It's only not Bitcoin if an economic minority hard forks off.

During a majority hash rate attack the miners are already devaluing everyone's investment so they might as well get fired and be replaced by new miners.

The amount not intended to be transferred to the payee is returned to the payer as change. So any measure of BTC real-world volume has to estimate what percentage of the gross volume is a real-world transfer, and what percentage is 'change', which doesn't represent a transfer between two parties.

"&gt; Let’s be honest

I am.

&gt;LN is more secure than 0-conf regardless of lack of RBF in Bitcoin Cash, the block time is still 10 minutes.

There are several problems with this statement. Zero-conf transactions are actually safer than most people think; safer than check or credit card fraud. Shapeshift actually used to accept 0-conf. [link 2](https://info.shapeshift.io/blog/2015/12/01/note-ceo-erik-voorhees-appeal-zero-conf). Additionally, with things like [weakblocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXFuNkaYcPQ) being worked on, the risk of something being unsafe after more than a fraction of a second would be extremely minuscule.

&gt; Plus if it does stay a persistent issue, Bitcoin’s blocksize is not staying at 1MB, no one has ever said that.

We've been trying to get a blocksize increase for 5 years. They wouldn't even allow a 1mb increase. LN will not work reliably on a global scale without blocks of at least several hundred megabytes. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYHFrf5ci_g). You should get the full backstory as to why the blocksize increase has been refused for so long: [post](https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/6ndfut/buttcoin_is_decentralized_in_5_nodes/dk9c27f/).

Additionally, you are assuming LN will work at all:

- you don't need a bank (thus far) to use it.

The first is going away soon. Banks will simply buy up enough BTC until they control enough of it to manipulate its price effectively. Eventually they will either use it as the - pardon my pun - gold standard for hedging purposes, or phase it out in favor of something that's devoid of opacity.

"Problem is Fiat does not lose value unless a country falls. Fiat is how you buy stuff in a country, Bitcoin would have to destroy the US as a country for the US dollar to be ignored, its more likely that the Chinese Yuan or other currencies like the Euro to eat into the US dominance than Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is also turning more into an asset class over a currency. Which sucks for adopters who want to see it become a currency. Once it becomes an asset it loses value as a currency, although some government agencies call it a currency. Unfortunately market forces are forcing it to be treated as an asset. Like Gold it will not have much relevance especially if it becomes way too overvalued. If its prices do reach what some want million dollars or billion dollars, it shifts away from a currency to compete against fiat and use for the average man, into a currency for big contracts between large corporations.

On the other hand its failure is more likely going to be due to volatile cost changes as smaller business get tired of dealing with bitcoin and move back to fiat to rely on something they can rely and predict on, instead of something that switches its value alot. The current stability looks good although dead it seems to have gained some sanity and slowly stabilizing to a proper market base. But I fear any inkling of growth will due to small user population see its price spike. If Bitcoin user base is extremely large like the dollar it's volatility will also decrease quite heavily and growth in it's worth will be more stable. Until then I will watch, don't want it to fail but if it does another Crypto can take up the mantle.

For me Bitcoin won't fail from outside forces but from the community itself. Who will in their quest for money and acceptance as well as recognition in Wall Street turn Bitcoin into something that works against what it was initially created for.",1525824966

""Wasn't wrong. We're at $10k. Going to $12k. NAV says I nailed it. All that counts.""
""Battle for $10k was over Thursday already.""
""If we don't make $12k I'll also be wrong.""
""we're a whisker away from $10k and it's likely to go this week-end""
""$10k won't last long. It doesn't matter anymore.""
""I'm just wondering why people who can't make calls criticise people who do make quite accurate calls ?""

"Honestly most people shouldn't need to care exactly how the actual technology  works, otherwise it will fail.

What is important about Bitcoin is basically summarized in the Introduction section of the whitepaper, but there are other resources (books, videos) that can help a great deal.

Maybe try this:

https://www.amazon.com/Whats-Big-Deal-About-Bitcoin-ebook/dp/B00RF3BQDU

It's on the resources list at https://derekmagill.com/bitcoin/ , which honestly contain many deeper level links not very suitable for general introduction.

able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority
decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested
in it. If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the
fastest and outpace any competing chains.

In this case, it seems that someone was careless, and that someone included people from coinbase and people from the show. Again, if you own your Bitcoin keys, this cannot happen.

The entire purpose of cryptocurrency is so that you can remove your trust from everyone else, and take complete control of your money. When you trust your crypto to someone else like coinbase, you open yourself to trusting others with your money.

Primarily I meant that the People developing Bitcoin, a censorship-resistant currency, should be against censorship, and they should be the kind of people that detest censorship at the very core of their being.

"Could you elaborate? To clarify, the feed contains every OP_RETURN transactions straight from the blockchain, so any BCH transaction with a message attached via OP_RETURN should show up.

Currently I have implemented a custom parser for just two application protocols (memo.cash and blockpress). This means, you will see ALL OP_RETURNs from Bitcoin, and all the rest of OP_RETURN transactions will show up as raw text. I think for now this works fine for most others because previously we didn't have this type of more sophisticated application protocols like memo.cash and blockpress, and OP_RETURNs used to be all just simple messages. 

But I think this should change in the coming days as the OP_RETURN size gets upgraded from 80bytes to 220 bytes. And I'm looking forward to implementing the frontend parsers for all the overlay app protocols that will launch in the coming days as well as those I have not been aware of.

"1. Your first question had me wondering if science can answer such a general question. Advantage could be a lot of different things depending on how one looks at it. Bitcoin (Cash) has a simpler scripting system, since it's aim is different. It does not aim to be a general purpose 'world computer' and this simplicity has an impact on its security. Complexity is the enemy of security. Simpler protocols can be analyzed easier. Real life observations (DAO and other hacks) and [studies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.06038.pdf) (PDF) shows that smart contracts are difficult to get right. Maybe that gives the simpler system an advantage when it comes to gaining acceptance in the crypto_currency_ space, but is that the aim of Ethereum? I don't know. Perhaps someone else knowledgeable about ETH can chip in.

2. The most prominent focused research in this area that I know of was the work done at Cornell [1] which found 4MB blocks to be safe, but this was long ago, and is very dated w.r.t. the evolved technology (e.g. it does not account for the effects of fast block propagation protocols such as CompactBlocks, Xthin or recent improvements on those, like Graphene), nor fast relay networks as far as I recall (FIBRE, Falcon etc.) Recent research and work in the area of scaling the p2p network in a way applicable not only to Bitcoin but other, similar cryptocurrencies, seems to be happening at bloxRoute Labs [2,3,4].

I hope others more closely following the details can give you more of an informed opinion. The blocksize that can be called 'safe' depends on the cryptocurrency and is tied to the characteristics of its network. Intrinsically I would say there is no limit but what is imposed by technology, so it's not strictly a question for science to be able to give an analytical answer, but they can measure and model and come up with a decent estimate, and engineering will render it obsolete by improving upon the technology involved (processing power, storage capacity, network throughput, software algorithms...)

Experimentally, we can say that the Bitcoin Cash chain has demonstrated it can handle blocks of size of up to 8 megabytes without suffering noticeable loss of network nodes. But of course we don't have enough regular load of that nature on the system. From test systems we know that much higher loads can easily be sustained by available server hardware. It will be interesting to see whether much of the network is pre-emptively dimensioned for much higher capacities than currently used, and whether demand materializes now that supply (32MB block size cap) will become plentiful.

"&gt; But why is it that Core goes so vehemently against upgrading the blocksize even to 2MB and silences everyone who disagrees?

That is an interesting question.  I don't know for certain why, but I've heard many reasons.  I've been following bitcoin since I first heard about it in 2009!  I am a researcher in distributed systems (among other things), so I am quite interested in this subject!  I'm not endorsing at all the decisions that they have made, but I don't attribute to malice that which can also be ignorance.

I can understand the argument on the disruptive nature of a forced client upgrade.  We're talking about a significant economy here - caution is not a bad idea.  There is absolutely the possibility of a chain split.  It could result in loss of funds, and potential damage to the reputation of the currency.  Is it possible to do it smoothly?  Yes it is, but there are some not so insignificant risks.  I'll be watching how the BCH upgrade goes on the 15th very closely!  I think part of the appeal of the segwit soft-fork was that it didn't require any breaking changes to the network.  New features are added as nodes upgrade, but old nodes still work.  Of course, this comes with the cost of technical debt, but it is still arguably less risky (or at least the risk can be contained) when the event itself happens.

The other cause I believe was that the limited block size stimulated alternative innovation for solutions.  This includes investment in the development of layer 2, more efficient signature schemes, and other changes to the protocol which allow more transactions/MB.  The interesting feature here is that you don't need to immediately improve the performance of networks, processing, (and storage to a lesser degree) to get more performance.  Segwit didn't really improve this performance much, but it did buy time for BTC.  Segwit didn't do this, but if you can fit 2x the transactions in 1MB, then a blocksize increase of 2x scales the throughput by 4x or more.  An increase of 32x scales throughput by 64x or more.  If something like schnorr can be used, a 32x blocksize increase could increase throughput by several 100x.   Arguably, this investment in efficiency wouldn't happen unless there is some incentive to motivate it, but holding back block-size increases is (in my opinion) not the best way to create this incentive!

I would consider myself open-minded.  I don't like many things about BCH, and I don't like many things about BTC, but I still acknowledge the merits where due.

I'm actually very personally invested in blockchain forks!  I run a website (coinpanic.com) to help people claim BTC forks, and I've written lots of my own blockchain code.  I also run the 13th largest LN node on mainnet.  I want to explore and speak from experience.  I also want to see success wherever it is.",1525821453

Let me remind you that there are four competing implementations of the Lightning Network so far and that the fees on the Lightning Network are practically symbolic. A healthy Lightning Network promotes extremely low fees.

As I wrote earlier, bitcoin's most senior developer isn't an employee of Blockstream. Most developers aren't and anyone can participate to the project, something you conveniently ignore.

Your claim that bitcoin is being co-opted by Blockstream is pure projection (Bitcoin Cash is largely Bitmain's pet) and silly conspiratorial thinking.

If Bitcoin is running on consensus rule X, and someone comes along to add consensus rule Y (a tightening of the consensus rules), then all the old clients that only enforce X are still able to follow and rebroadcast the state of the network, but they've had their options limited. They can no longer create transactions that pass X but fail Y.

For example, a $95k BTC is imo far more likely than a $800 NEO (assuming they both 10x). 

The fact that NYSE is planning on selling BTC in the future certainly has added *massive* legitimacy in my eyes. I just can't see that happening *any* time soon for any other coin. *Maybe* Ethereum at some point, but I think it needs more time to mature. On top of all this, my portfolio at the time was like 35% BTC, 40% NEO and the rest alts. It feels *much* more balanced to me right now after moving some NEO into BTC. 

Maybe my decision will wind up costing me. Maybe not. But right now, I feel that this was the right thing to do, and I have to live with that. I still love NEO and still hold some, but this was necessary. What do you guys think?",1525818201

"Agreed. The true decentralization will lie with an Internet of value, which is the new financial system, where the financial system itself is open-source for all developers to contribute and help shape it with the user’s of currencies free to choose their currency of choice on this network.
A great currency is meant to be simple (it’s just a coin), take up minimal space, and allow the people to build and contribute to a system for the currency the way that they believe it ought to be. Bitcoin (BTC) is all of the above.

The lesser decentralization is a financial system only based off and connected to the currency itself. That’s a highly central concept. I don’t want a block size debate, but larger blocks lead to more centralization as well considering a simple 1MB block can run on any device currently and in the future. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is the lesser decentralized project by far.

"""It doesn't have mixing.""

Great reply, however just FYI.  Monero does not use mixing either.

""Mixin"" as a term used in Monero is different than how the term may be used for Bitcoin or DASH mixing services. In Monero, new transactions ""mix"" with other previous transactions in the blockchain in the way the protocol itself dictates. In other services, you ""mix"" your coins with other users' coins to make one transaction with many inputs and outputs. The verb used here is the same, but they are referring to two very different things.",1525816437

It is like the currency of all the cryptos. However, it is also changing with fiat pairs to the other cryptos. I personally like to watch crypto lark, blockchain brad.

"Imagine a congested highway. There are 2 plans to fix the congestion. 

1: Automated robotic cars that are fuel efficient, fast, safe, and allow you to use the space more efficiently. Then make flying cars so that there is space above and below you to basically commute with no traffic.

2: Build a huge road twice as big, and every time it gets full, just build a new one next to it.

Well Bitcoin Cash is a legitimate coin. It's not better than Bitcoin, but it's capacity for transactions come at the cost for centralization. However, the fix is simpler, and easy to understand. However, increasing the block size by 8x also increases the cost of running a node by 8x, in bandwidth, HDD space, CPU, and GPU. This in turn means each block can hold 8 times the transactions, but also costs 8 times the resources, canceling out. Bitcoin Cash fees are lower now for the same reason Dogecoin is lower, because the block sizes are a few hundred KB and nobody uses it now. That being said, this DID in fact increase the capacity.

Bitcoin solution for scaling involves increasing the capacity by making it more efficient. Lower block sizes mean that running a node is less expensive, and the blockchain doesn't need to permanently store the entire larger chain. Also, just like fast/cheap transactions such as Paypal, Venmo, and Cashapp, Lightning Network is centralized and relies on trust. Except the cool part? It relies and trusts the BLOCKCHAIN, making LN decentralized by proxy. It's centralized to a central ledger, Blockchain, and we all know how that works.",1525816350

#Where in the white paper does it say decentralized!?

The answer is nowhere. He mentioned it in the release because he is comparing a ""peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server"" to the current banking networks. Meaning that it is decentralized compared to the existing payment networks.

The Bitcoin network is already inherently distributed, it has no need to be decentralized any further. 

That is my point. The decentralization already happened when Bitcoin was created, the goal should be said to be to keep it distributed.

In your words,  what is a proper amount of ""decentralization"" that we should strive for? (#) nodes? (#) developers? (#) development teams? (#) miners? (#) hodlers? (#) users?

Or should we just strive for it to be as distributed as possible?

Bitcoin came to life out of the utter ruin and chaos of the global financial crisis of 2007/2008. Like a phoenix, Bitcoin rose from the ashes of the old financial order. Bitcoin was forged in the hell fires of destroyed century old institutional financial players, capitalism that is crippled and collapsing under its own weight, corrupt central bankersters and their pet politicians; and still it rises. The trust in the old system is at a global historical low. The system is no longer organically sustainable and without blind trust; collapse is imminent. As the last vestige of trust is stripped from the old system, people will need to place their trust in a new form of money. That will be Bitcoin and other blue chip tokens like ethereum. People trust technology, it has become a foundational cornerstone in everyone's life. Bitcoin require no trust, no banks, no intermediary, has been up for 99.998% of its history, deflationary, gold like qualities, intrinsically valuable for its immutable historical public record, the most secure asset on the planet; and will be unaffected by bank bail ins/outs. People will gravitate to bitcoin as they witness their economies collapse while bitcoin hodlers continue to have their savings unaffected. Not only do I think bitcoin will not collapse; it will greatly increase in value and its properties become more self evident to people that were not previously paying attention. ",1525815456

Futures add into the equation literally a sale to be settled at a future point in time.

Any soft-fork (where previously valid rules become invalid) works like that. Aren't you worried about those unconfirmed transactions stored somewhere with e.g. OP_XOR that has been invalidated? Or those  OP_NOP2  transactions that were valid but now fail OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY? These are all very unlikely but what about transactions failing BIP66 (strict DER signature)?

"It's not about stupidity or complexity. it's about efficiency. If you have 500k in a cold storage wallet, it is always going to be proportionally more expensive to keep that secure than if it is part of a much larger haul secured by a bank.

You need to completely hide the fact that you have that much money in crypto. Since that's likely impossible, you need to secure it. And yourself. Since, anyone could potentially extort the private key out of you, with zero recourse on your part. 

The ability to reverse a bank transaction, and the ability of the bank to keep an eye on what's going on is actually hugely valuable. If you have your provate key stored somewhere, you need to secure it to a very high standard, in an extremely expensive safe, with sophisticated electronic security systems.

Since the cost of these systems doesnt' scale linearly with the amount of money stored, it will always cost a fraction of the cost of self storage to secure it in a bank.

And that's ignoring all the other huge advantages a bank can provide, like contactless payments, standing orders, credit, overdrafts, and more.

The real question is why people would use any given crypto, and not any other one, or more importantly, one which is guaranteed to hold its value, like USDT, or some equivalent state backed crypto, if they just want the benefits of crypto, and not a money making scheme. ",1525813832

And then why would I accept Bitcoin as payment for my car when the Bitcoin might be worth 25% of its value by next week? I don’t blame the IRS as they would be missing out on a huge “Internal Revenue” opportunity by not charging capital gains tax; despite the fact taxing each transaction is annoying and not practice. I think we’ll need a good 5 years at least before seeing it as a currency but maybe I’m wrong.,1525813056

"&gt; Couldn't they just keep increasing the blocksize? 

No. Blocksize increases scale poorly. 

A blockchain is a global ledger. It is the most expensive database in the world.  Increasing its size or rate should be done very carefully, and tied to the technology level of the internet and the speed of light vs the size of the planet. It cannot increase simply based on demand.

As an analogy: if you are riding in a horse-drawn carriage and you want to make it faster or larger, how many horses can you add before the system breaks down ?

To scale bitcoin, or any similar system, you need a layer 2 solution.

&gt; Again, I understand there are crazy draw backs to increasing the block size like that. But since those don't bother bcash users, those are irrelevant for now ;)

The system not working should concern them.

""Oyster will eventually create a peer-to-peer network where webnodes don't communicate over webRTC, not relying on ISPs anymore. It will essentially be a hybrid system for a long time, not questioning that, since changes like that are gradually and not happening over night. Imagine you are connecting to the meshnet through direct p2p connection to your neighbors wlan or people are hosting hotspots or even antenna like build ups similar to what @Brad187  showed us in NYC. (https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.cbc.ca/amp/1.4617106) But all those connecting parties are becoming part of the Oyster meshnet themselves and eventually becoming new entry points, too. Your fridge could be build with an own version of the web node script, creating a completly new dynasty of web nodes, with other treasure hunting logics or other package transmitting logics. And on top of this giant meshnets one can run Javascript applications, while paying with SHLs. It's hard to imagine first.

Unlike substrstum or other solutions oyster doesn't have to rely on voluntary participants or crypto enthusiast to run nodes for revenue - since PRL is like a start up boost for SHL, everybody visits websites afterall - creating a meshnet without of the need of voluntary enthuiasts.""",1525812948

"you seem to be infinitely unaware of what sample sizes are, and generally what I just laid out, in that I'm not taking about indicators from 60 years ago, but 60 years OF indicators. Let's dive into that! 

The data of 60 years of performance is immeasurably more valuable of an investment or any stat metric than the data of 3 years. Law of large numbers and such. That definite, more or less universally agreed upon math concept within the bounds of the type of data we are looking at right now aside....

Given this meme is arguing 3 year time frames to make  a point, let's do a thought experiment: If i was to plan an investment based on, say, equities, then I'd be in for a pretty rude awakening if I used, like you say, 'recent investment indicators.'

Lets say I planned off the past 5 years of equities, that's pretty recent, \(21&amp;#37;, 12&amp;#37;, 2&amp;#37;, 13&amp;#37;, and wow 32&amp;#37;!\). My average is a pretty healthy 16&amp;#37;! Let's use that! When I'm hit with a real average 7&amp;#37;/year, and markedly miss any goals I had for investing, or even when Mr. 2008 \-32&amp;#37; return rolls around, I'll learn the value of large data sets. If I use 3 years? That's even more inaccurate. But that's just investing.

But then maybe you're talking about trading, i.e. BTC is a better trade that BRK due to the past 3 years of returns. I'm going to point you to a little disclaimer on quite literally every financial document that reads along the lines of 'past performance is not an indicator nor a guarantee of future performance."" There are way too many reddit posts to make here to explain the backing of that and why it's true. BUT, that aside, two things: Going back to our equity trader in the previous paragraph, you bet your ass any reputable T1 trader is planning for that 7&amp;#37;/avg, i.e. making hedges to not expose himself to the wild swings of prices that generate that 7&amp;#37;, on average. Do you know where that market know\-how comes from? 100 years of available data, not 3. Moving from there, a little thought experiment: tell what BTC will be tomorrow. Or next minute. That's right, you can't. You can't even accurately tell me with a data driven argument that BTC won't return 0.1&amp;#37;/year until 2020.  I can't either, and that's ok because I know I can't.

But then maybe you're talking about vol. Yup, vol in BTC is much easier to determine and loosely predict based on trading volumes and such, and in that case, the vol is what is pulling a lot of traders in. And yes an entirely speculative asset like BTC is a good bet to have more vol than a 60 y/o company, minus any acts of god \(but wait, those happen all the time, let's go back to ""past returns do not...."", but that aside\). But you didn't say vol, you said 3 years of return performance being a better indicator than 60 years of data, which again, makes zero sense. ",1525812924

"[What makes Bitcoin Decentralized?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin_Facts/comments/7dp5cn/point_2_decentralization_what_is_it_why_we_have/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=Bitcoin_Facts&amp;utm_content=t3_7dqpr6)


&gt;Decentralization is one of Bitcoin's main selling points. But what does it actually mean? Skip to the end for the tl;dr

**What is centralization**    
As we all know from reading everything Satoshi wrote about his design for Bitcoin from satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org, Bitcoin was finalized and born in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. In this event many normal people lost money while banking executives made more and more. 

**Where does centralization come from**       
These banks, much like the bank you probably use today, are centralized. That is, they alone control everything that happens. There is one database which has everyone's funds, if they decide you are a terrorist or something they can stop you from access your money. They can stop you from making transactions. Even if you have done nothing wrong they can stop payment on your transactions without your consent, lock you out of your funds, and monitor everything you do. 


**What  is decentralization**       
By splitting up the 'power' that a bank has we decentralize it. There is no longer any one single entity that can control txs and funds. This way no one is 'in charge' and no one can give themselves bonuses while other people lose money. This decentralization is a founding point of Bitcoin.

**Where does decentralization come from**       
Instead of one company controlling the database of funds like in the centralized model, in Bitcoin's decentralized model there are many people who can all contribute to the database and transaction processing without any one entity having full control. In Bitcoin and other POW based cryptocurrencies this decentralization is achieved by having a number of *mining nodes* who are not affiliated. As long as no group of miners controls more than 51% of the hashpower, bitcoin remains decentralized.

---


**So only mining nodes contribute to decentralization, then what about non-mining nodes**      
Non-mining nodes, full nodes, relay nodes, or storage nodes are often misunderstood to be part of decentralization. This can be easily cleared up by understanding the above information and then understanding that a non-mining node has no *power* if the majority of hashpower were to do something they didn't like. 

**I thought everyone was supposed to run a full node**      
This is another common misunderstanding, in the very beginning Satoshi did intend for everyone to run a node with 4 functions. He is very clear when he explains how this is not the way for the system to function in the future. The plan of bitcoin is that everyone can make trustless peer-to-peer transactions on a decentralized system. Not that everyone would run a home server with the whole blockchain. The business and bitcoin companies that need to have personal and instant validation of their tx can run a full nodes. Random sampling is a tried and trusted method, those unable to host their own relay node would be easily able to verify their transactions with overwhelming mathematically certainty.

**So who wants to run a full node then**     
Anyone who wants to can, it's like the Olympics, 'anyone can compete but few feel the need to'. There is no reason the network should be ground to a halt and made useless so people who can't afford to make a transaction would be able to run a full node on a 20 year old computer over a dial up connection. Bitcoin was meant to scale with technology, not become left behind. 


**What are the 4 functions that all early nodes did**       
When you read the design of Bitcoin which we all invested into, the design on which so much was built, the one at nakamotoinstitute.org, you see Satoshi mention the word 'node' many times. What we today call a full node or non-mining node usually fulfills one of those functions, that of storing the database. Finding other peers for connecting to is done by full nodes and pool operators. Sending and receiving bitcoin, aka a wallet, was also a function every node had. Finally generating coins by putting new transactions into the blockchain was the 4th thing all nodes used to do. Today these 4 actions are largely compartmentalized, as they should be in any good computer science project.

---


This is Bitcoin, some people are unhappy with the way Bitcoin was designed, well I suppose Bitcoin is simply not for those people and they should maybe find something else to do.


I hope you've all learned something today about how Bitcoin is decentralized, what is means, and how we got there.

tl;dr Banks control all txs and accounts with one database and are centralized, Bitcoin has many miners who perform this actions to make it decentralized. Non-mining nodes don't contribute to decentralization. ",1525812666

* a blockchain
* a consensus of nodes
* the mining hashrate majority
* a community of users &amp; merchants

research the pineapple fund. research eat bch. This could be one of the most important aspects of cryptocurrency.

I feel like something like that could change the world. ,1525811464
"I feel like everyone is arguing about cryptocurrencies by mistake, when the argument is more about consensus mechanisms \- which is a good argument to have. Crypto will go through multiple variations of consensus mechanism before perfected. There are more emerging mechanisms being tested daily \(PoW, PoS, dPoS, PoA, pBFT, proof of signature etc.\) So Far PoW has been the best way to secure a network, but proven unscalable.  

As a reminder centralized consensus systems are what we have now in the real world, and it obviously works or else the world would be in chaos so it's not inherently bad. Is it perfect, no, of course not, but that's why we are all excited about blockchain anyways? So just because Bitcoin tech brought a valid decentralized system to the world, doesn't mean everything needs to be decentralized. Do you want decentralized heart surgery – where everyone who holds a token has equal say on which piece of you to cut? Or would you rather an expert? Ever hear the expression 'too many cooks in the kitchen?' Full decentralization will bring problems \- especially to governance. Anyone every work in the government before and realized nothing gets done.. Decision making is hard when spread to far and usual results in a stand still and constant bickering and in the cryptoverse forks \- see BTC 2017

 So before everyone loses their minds that just because VeChain probably isn't as decentralized as ETH \(in its final PoS state\) isn't important. If VeChain is decentralized enough to provide tamper\-proof and cost effective results for businesses but is centralized enough to provide a lucrative governance model then that is great \- it serves a purpose. And we've seen huge partnerships come from it \(PwC &amp; DNV GL\) who are confident it will succeed. 

Basically the way I see it, VeChain may have given up a touch of decentralization \(still to be seen at this point\) for scalability and governance. ETH is still trying to have the holy grail of pure decentralization, scalability and governance \- which in theory may be possible, but hasn't been implemented. No need to shit all over things cause they are different.",1525811458
"Good old Coinbase.  I remember when I was first getting into crypto and everytime I would have to wait for my funds to clear, the alts that I was targeting would all moon by the time I could by them, and my ETH would either drop in value or stay the same at best.  Then I would usually still buy the alts and they would drop in value almost immediately.  It was infuriating to say the least.  ",1525811440
"A) This is about censorship, not the block size debate. That's been had a million times over and clearly there's many people who believe either way is the correct solution.
B) Ver has done more for the adoption and advancement of bitcoin than the majority of people on the planet - just look it up.
C) I personally don't know the technical details of LN and Segwit, so I'm not going to argue that and pretend I know everything like all the BTC fans.
D) How can I be biased when only a few weeks ago I was on the other side of the exact same argument. It just took some real research and someone with the patience to explain things to me.
E) Your argument about ""either Bitcoin or born a year ago"" ignores the third option : Its what bitcoin has always been, and the 2nd layer solutions fork was built very recently but money and power allowed them to take control of the brand and development.
F) Surely you must know what Blockstream did?
G) It's a bit of a null argument to say that ""BTC has a bigger community therefore is the real Bitcoin"". Because although I agree that long term the better coin should win out, by your own logic you're saying that if BCH were to get majority community support (which is almost impossible given the control Blockstream have), then it would be the ""real Bitcoin"", yet you've just said its not the real Bitcoin. Which is it, because the reality is that both BTC and BCH are modified versions of the BTC of a few years back, and the argument is that BCH is much closer to that version, and is less of a fork away from the original, and therefore should at least have as much rights to the name as BTC. Although, since it's open source software, that argument alone is not enough. We must also consider the huge adoption and support for BCH and BTC, in order to remove anyone from creating a coin and claiming its the original.

The main concern is not the market cap or whatever though, the problem is that the community wanted bigger block sizes and got censored and banned and smeared into nothingness. That's what frustrates me, and I don't want a company capable of doing that to take over development of BTC. Just my view. ",1525811424
"&gt; Usage across the whole ecosystem collapsed

Blabla. BTC usage collapsed to the level of 2 years ago because of their ridiculous fee market idiocy. Ethereum txs quintupled within a year. ",1525811421
"I'd say you're mistaken. Bitcoin was intended to evolve and change, the original implementation being released as version 0.1 makes that conclusion inescapable. However proposed changes require consensus as described in the white paper. 

[section 4] ""The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it."" 

In the case of the BCH fork, BCH does not have the greatest proof of work invested in it, and never did. The BCH changes to the consensus rules lacked consensus of the majority, rendering it's blocks invalid to Bitcoin nodes. 

One interesting aspect of all this is that Satoshi and the white paper did not anticipate the emergence of ASIC chips (and the covert ASIC boost Bitmain developed which gave it an edge against the many other hardware manufacturers from earlier years) which lead to the high degree of mining centralization we see today. Bitmain has controlled a majority of hash power for some time and could win (could have won) a consensus dispute based on POW. Bitmain is also a major contributer to the creation of BCH. That raises the question of why Bitmain did not use it's influence to give BCH the consensus it needed to become ""Bitcoin"". I think the reason is two-fold. 1: Bitmain does not control a majority of nodes, those favor Bitcoin without the block size increase (at this time). 2: The economic majority does not favor the block size increase, hash power follows money.

I also think that 1 cent fee is too high, and it is not instant on-chain (not cryptographically secure until mined into a block - just in a volatile distributed mempool until then).  LN transactions are still instant, and they are cryptographically secure. 

As for fees, LN routing fees creates a ""race to the bottom"" for fees.  I'm seeing fees of no more than 3 Satoshi at this time, and it's only going to get cheaper.  The LN protocol supports down to 0.001 Satoshi fees, which will then be rounded on channel close.

""Bitcoin has never had a planned hardfork since its inception"" This is false - but maybe not depending on your definition of 'planned'. Hard forked in August 2010 due to an overflow error - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=822.0 Hard forked with Bitcoin XT, Classic, Unlimited...

""More over, high fees are a problem, but its not a permanent problem if offchain solutions become available later."" How later are we talking about?

I know many people who live solely off of Bitcoin (the BCH chain) who were forced to switch because of the unreliable fees of BTC. You can't be living off of a currency whose fees you cannot predict (past performance is not a reliable indicator of the future). Like I said, 2nd layer could work, but the Core devs did nothing to stop the fee spike in December. 

""every spam transaction ever"" it's not spam if it has a fee attached to it. It's up to the miners to determine their individual minimum fee for accpetance. 

""In bitcoin, who verify and thus controls the consensus protocol? Its not the miners."" Pretty sure it's the miners bud. Satoshi never envisioned users to run nodes anyways, just the miners. It's peanuts for miners and for Bitcoin companies to set up and run a node.

"&gt;BTC's refusal to raise the blocksize at all was moronic.

But they didnt refuse it. In fact, they implemented a blocksize increase! What they refused was to do that via a **hardfork** and on a date dictated by a few large industry players in a backroom deal,  without proper time for testing, without using the opportunity of a hardfork to fix some old lingering issues. They where absolutely right to object to that. Bitcoin has never had a planned hardfork since its inception. We will need a hardfork one day, but that had better be well planned, well though out, well tested and based on an overwhelming consensus. Until then, a softfork blocksize increase that also fixed at least some old issues, and allowed LN, is a completely reasonable approach. It was the only sane approach when 100s of billions are on the line. Have you seen what actually happened to the segwit2x fork? It failed after a few blocks because some drop dead stupid coding error. That would have been bitcoin failing if bitcoin users had agreed to the fork. That would have made frontpage news and cost the entire crypto community 10s if not 100s of billions. So yeah, good call Bitcoin core devs.

&gt;We're against L2 when they are forced upon a user, like when the blockchain is too expensive to use so the BTC camp is purporting LN like it's THE way to use Bitcoin.

The problem is you can not have your cake and eat it. If onchain transaction are dirt cheap, there is no incentive to develop L2, there is virtually no incentive to use L2, and everything almost everything will happen on chain. Which will fill the blocks, necessitating ever larger blocks to maintain low fees, until it stop being a P2P network. More over, high fees are a problem, but its not a permanent problem if offchain solutions become available later. Large blocks, once created,  are a permanent, unfixable problem. You cant undo it, every spam transaction ever will be in there forever consume terrabytes and exabytes. Bitcoins worse case sceneario is that it remains low volume, niche, relatively expensive solution, but secure, immutable and decentralised. BCH worst case scenerio is a highly inefficient paypal.

&gt;There still wouldn't be a single point of failure. 

Its not about failure. Nodes dont exist just for redundancy. You can achieve redundancy with databases too. This is about **control**. In bitcoin, who verify and thus controls the consensus protocol? Its not the miners. Its not BTC owners. Only nodes do. If users can not run nodes, then a few large players gain full control over the protocol. Welcome to Ver-coin.

"Definitely not. At least, not from a financial perspective. You could buy in today and you’d be firmly on the train, which has not taken off yet. It was an awful idiom for him to use. 

However, it does appear you’ve missed the train from an intelligence perspective. Your vitriol towards Vechain seems to be because of some sketchy brigading or whatever on one forum on one website on the internet. It’s a pretty niche thing to get your panties wrinkled over in the first place, but to vehemently dismiss the entire project because of this is downright stupid. Especially when Vechain themselves weren’t even behind this and publicly bashed that behavior as soon as they were made aware of it. 

Whatever, that’s all irrelevant. What is relevant is that Vechain is a phenomenal crypto project, and has the potential for the quickest and largest real world adoption of any coin on the market. And this adoption will take place in areas that affect and improve the lives of the average person, which is so much more important than somehig like banks using ripple. 

With that said, if you’re a fan of *any* crypto project, you’re a fan of Vechain. Whether or not you have money invested in Vechain, their being adopted and used by major, major, major companies around the world helps your coin out too. That’s the thing you and the rest of the idiots don’t seem to understand. This isn’t yet a company vs company race. It’s a race by the entire industry to be adopted by the real world. 

Any coin that achieves this even a tiny bit is helping every single other crypto project to gain some much needed respect and be taken seriously. And so far, no one is coming close to what Vechain has accomplished as far as real world usage is concerned. 

Yet instead of being happy for the entire crypto sector, you’d rather scream platitudes like “shitcoin” and “scam” about a project you know nothing about, and are clearly emotional over.

Sure, you will be processing more transactions at the time of processing the blocks, but those blocks will take longer to process.

LN is not the reason we don't see big blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain. It is because it is a change that can't be done without having all the network comply with the change. That is why the Bitcoin Cash fork failed. 
Even if the bitcoin core team were to issue an update accepting bigger blocks that doesn't mean that all nodes will comply and update right away and if some don't that will defer value to the blockchain that didn't comply with the change (thus creating a fork, even if it was meant to be an update)

Is that in the white paper as well?

&gt; The whitepaper is not specific on how to accomplish things for the most part.

Sorry? What? 

Are you saying the whitepaper allows for a protocol upgrade like NG? 

Or are you saying the whitepaper doesn't define what Bitcoin is? 

You can believe either, as far as I am concerned, but you should define what you actually mean - as to me it seems you are picking and choosing what and what you don't take as Satoshi gospel. 

&gt; The point is, you're ignoring technical advancements both in hardware AND in software.

Why do you think this? All I questioned was whether blockspace in BCH was considered a scarce resource (in economic terms). If it's not, this fundamentally changes the security of the network. 

You say it doesn't, and that is fine, but then you hand wave away a concern I have and instead point to two improvement proposals, as if they have the answer. Hint, they don't.

I never said you wouldnt.

BTC is already bottlenecked and LN is still far away from being ready for game time. To bet on BTC/LN is like saying: ""Let's wait a few years, then maybe we'll race for users and merchants"".

BCH is certainly on a race for mindshare, the difference is that they can absorb the uptake in merchants and users, it's ready for the uptake now instead of 2020

How exactly will LN improve security, or quicker confirmations or true p2p cash? It is a complex topic, and everyone everywhere (except geeks) will end up setting up a single channel with Amazon with all of their bitcoins in the channel. It is so blindly obvious that that will happen.

As is your natural right. The market may even be overwhelming appreciative/supportive/accepting/forgiving (depending on perspective) of the decision to do so. It would, however, set the undeniable precedent that, on at least one occasion, the consensus rules had changed such that previously valid transactions were invalidated.


&gt; An ugly solution to all the hypothetical unconfirmed transactions, but better than leaving it as is, would be to allow legacy SIGHASH only for unspent outputs older than the hard fork date.

I agree that this is an ugly solution, but also estimate it to be far more inline with the expectations of bitcoin. It  would probably be quite effective at mitigating any DoS due to the difficulty in acquiring the private keys to existing outputs.

Another potential option, since we're only really worried about transactions and not node compatibility in this hypothetical hard fork, would be to restrict legacy transactions to small blocks.

I will agree that big blocks are NOT the only solution. BTC's refusal to raise the blocksize at all was moronic. I am under the belief there will be one coin to rule them all as a world currency and BCH is it now. There are other ways that BCH can scale including things like graphene.

I think one of the biggest misconceptions people have of BCH supporters is that they are against layer two or other scaling solutions besides big blocks. We're against L2 when they are forced upon a user, like when the blockchain is too expensive to use so the BTC camp is purporting LN like it's THE way to use Bitcoin. 

Even if only datacenters could run nodes (there are about 8 million around the world) - these datacenters would be all over the world, in different countries with different jurisdictions. There still wouldn't be a single point of failure.

"Thanks for the feedback.

I see your point on @mentions (inline tagging).  There is definitely a distinction in functionality between messaging a user, and mentioning them in a post.  @mentions inside a post will require a dedicated server to scan the blockchain for those messages and index them based on the users mentioned.  This would not be very friendly to a light client that does not want to access a web server.  Comparatively, having a user tagged via a transaction to them, makes it very easy to scan the blockchain.   If a dev doesn't mind calling web RPCs, right now there are none that can query either messaging spec, whereas almost every blockchain explorer out there has a way to query an address and its transactions.  

That's not to say @mentions aren't a good idea and essential in the current social climate.  They definitely should be implemented somehow :)

If I were to revise my proposal title, it would be more of a ""public messages to specific users"" than a tagging system that most people think of.

The dust issue sounds like a more general problem that would be solved in some future version of bitcoin.  For example, dedicating a percentage of a mined block to zero-fee (or low-fee) transactions consisting of only dust.  Whatever the dust solution is, it isn't here yet, so your concerns about too much dust are something to consider.  Perhaps the general dust issue won't be addressed UNTIL there's a lot of people with a lot of dust.

I agree about having protocols as simple or generic as possible.  The community idea is only there because the way I suggested tagging users would easily facilitate it without any extra work. The proposal is generic enough that the person being messaged can be a community, or any other object (torrent) that people would want to store metadata against.",1525807859

They don't take that same approach as most other cryptos, instead they partner with consortiums (that are still growing and expanding) to develop projects, working together and utilizing the loop technology.

"&gt; Before a recent change from Monero's developers, that timing analysis correctly identified the real coin more than 90 percent of the time, virtually nullifying Monero's privacy safeguards

I would bold ""Before a recent change""... instead of a previous failure-rate.

so a monero-tx can be correctly ""spotted"" 45% of the time, so if I want 1/1Mil chance to be in the clear I would need 17 transactions, or 5 for 2%. The question is also can it be proven that it goes there 45% of the time, or does it just mean it can be guessed which destination is the most likely. If the second is true, are way fewer tx needed to be on the safe side. I assume that article refers to https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04299/. I am going to read that paper at a later date and might edit this comment then to reflect what I found.

&gt;Monero's transaction fees are WAY too high for this to be feasible.

Sure it is feasible (and perhaps even advisable). For people with above x amount of money. Say I want to make 1000$ anonymous assuming the changing service take 1% each way (Idk the real number tbh) and I do 5 monero transactions I pay about a 3% fee to conclusively make my money disconnected from me. Assuming you are in a country with crazy drug laws for example this is very feasible to do, and I would recommend it, think of doing an EV-calculation, even if it keeps you out of prison only 1 ot of 1000 times, that would be money very well spent.

I am with your criticisms of BTC-transaction as they just want to be ""money""(wait, do they still want to be money? anyway...), whereas Monero wants to guarantee privacy.",1525807840

"&gt;In the same post you say large blocks are bad and then you say yay! BTC blocks are 4x of what they used to be.

Sigh. Im saying larger blocks alone are no real solution. 4MB limit of segwit is theoretical, in practice segwitt  blocks will rarely exceed 2MB. I dont see that as problematic yet. I dont even think BCH initial 4MB blocks are really a problem, thats roughly comparable to Ethereum. If that was possible without hardfork, I wouldnt object to it.  8MB starts pushing it, 32 is getting idiotic, and the terrabyte blocks needed to reach visa level scalability, is a moronic concept as long as there isnt some major technological breakthrough in consumer storage capacity and network bandwidth.

&gt;The LN can work, but not at the expense of having the 1st layer have extremely high fees.

Remains to be seen. We dont know yet how LN will be used.

&gt;Tx count is down across the board and that's why tx are relatively cheap at this moment. Anytime there is a price spike the blocks get filled again and fees skyrocket.

Yes, that will happen eventually. But it will happen pretty much regardless of blocksize, unless you go to a moronically large block size that no one but a few a dedicated datacenters can handle. At which point, its no longer a peer 2 peer, decentralized system, but a system where you have to trust a small number of nodes, mining becomes completely pointless, and you are better off with a system like Ripple.",1525807489

"LN will naturally centralize the base Bitcoin layer due to fewer miners mining on it. If LN is the golden scaling solution that most tx will occur on and users rarely make Bitcoin tx, all those tx fees will be going to LN node operators, not Bitcoin miners. Couple this with the block reward subsidy halving every 4 years and you have a natural exodus of miners to other more profitable SHA256 coins.


In order to retain miners you either need to massively increase on-chain tx (blocksize increase) or massively increase on-chain fees (fee market). Increasing on-chain tx does increase miner and non-mining node resource requirements (well within reason IMO). Increasing fees immediately excludes potential users from the network and lessens the appeal of the network versus its competitors.


So if you're worried about centralization you need to define what centralization is, how much of it is acceptable, and whether:

a) driving away miners from the base layer to competing chains is acceptable 

b) how much hashpower vs competing chains is acceptable (is it okay if BTC ends up with only 10% hashrate?)

c) is restricting the blocksize so fees artificially increase in order to subsidize falling block rewards acceptable

d) is driving away users through higher fees healthy for the ecosystem  ",1525807435

"Sure, maybe I'm wrong about scaling. Maybe Bitcoin will die a slow and painful death, while Bcash reigns supreme. But in the unlikely chance that that happens, Bcash still won't be Bitcoin. Period.

In the old days, people would sell shares just before the tax year end and then buy them back on the next day.

Then when they eventually sell for real, the gain and resulting tax would be lower.

Their are now specific rules in place which prevent this (which are also applicable to crypto). When you make a sale, you have to match it against purchases in the following sequence:
1) Assets you purchased on the same day
2) Assets you purchased in the **proceeding** 30 days
3) Assets from the S104 holding (basically an average cost pool)

"some perspective, as these arguments generally are laughably full of holes even for BTC enthusiasts, and then they surface up to CNBC and such and make the community look bad:

BRK lifetime growth, 1964\-2018: 154,342,632&amp;#37;    

\-Annualized return: $28k

\-Math: \(\(273000 \- 19\)/19\)\*100, that's current price of about 273k, starting price in '64 of $19. 

Now, that math is a little tricky in showing a complete picture, bc a lot of that growth was probably the early years of BRK, but the starting stock price and the today price are what they are. 

If you can tell me BTC's 55 year return, or even an expected annual return, then ok. But we can't. So this is a close to nonsense cherry\-picked timeline for comparing BRK v. BTC. If my math is wrong or I'm missing something, definitely open to debate. ",1525806325

"&gt; Are ASICs a good thing?

Yes, they increase the security and efficiency of the network, assuming they are distributed among multiple parties

&gt; Can a cryptocurrency successfully adopt larger block sizes without ASICs?

Sure, the ASICs themselves don't care about the blocksize, or the transactions in the blocks, they just do the work to find the solution for the next block. The nodes that these ASICs are submitting their work to are dealing with the transactions.

&gt; Can any existing cryptocurrency currently scale to service hundreds of millions of users without larger block sizes?

Maybe those that don't use conventional blockchains, who knows, we don't have the demand to properly test such a scenario in the real world.

&gt; Can Bitcoin Cash scale to service hundreds of millions or billions of users with steady increases in block size in sync with Moores Law?

Possibly, it just depends on how far out we're looking, and how quickly adoption happens. In 25+ years, yeah probably won't be a problem, but by that time there will probably already be optimizations that have allowed it to get to that point if adoption outpaces what the network can safely handle.

In his spare time Gilfoyle likes to mine Bitcoin, but only if it is profitable to do so.


COO – Jared Dunn: Non disclosure agreements prevent Jared from revealing anything about his past. When it came to finding a COO, Hendricks recruited from within and promoted Mr Dunn from his humble position of Head of Business Development. Jared also enjoys intimidating interns in his spare time.

CFO – Monica Hall: Monica joined the PiedPiper team the other day. After obtaining her MBA at Stanford Graduate School of Business, she went on to work for McKinsey before joining VC firm Raviga Capital. Laurie Bream and Monica then went on to found their own VC fund Bream-Hall and Monica exited herself to join the PiedPiper gang as CFO.

"Yes, it is worse, but not exclusively for the reason you noted.  The biggest problem is routing.

Currently, routing is handled by creating a network graph (or map) and having every node that needs routing (read: everyone) maintain their own graph.  So how do you create and maintain a network graph?  Easy, just have everyone broadcast every transaction to every participant.

Wait, so how is that more efficient than the current bitcoin system that also broadcasts every transaction?  It's not.  With bitcoin, every transaction must be broadcast to every full node, which in practice has shown to be about 1-5k nodes to support an indefinite (and possibly unlimited) number of users.  So for a simple transaction, 5,000 messages of 255 bytes each must be sent around the globe.

With LN and it's current path finding/routing system, every transaction must be broadcast to every node, which in this case is every participant.  This means that for a network of 100,000 users/nodes, the first thought is that 1 transaction requires the sending and receiving of 100,000 messages of XXX bytes (insert estimated LN TX size, which will likely be larger than bitcoin's).  

But that's not all, for multi-hop payments, which is what I'm talking about here, there's not 1 transaction to broadcast when one transaction takes place.  Instead, for a four hop transaction: A-&gt;B-&gt;C-&gt;D-&gt;E, there are actually 4 transactions that need to be recorded and broadcast to maintain the network graph.  So in this example, 400,000 messages need to be sent and received for Alice to pay Edward and for the network to maintain an up to date graph.

Now some LN proponents will say that LN transactions are private and aren't broadcast, or that a network graph does not need to be maintained, but then there's no way to quickly find a path through the network...which is the ""routing problem"" in a nutshell. 

For single hop payments between users who do not want to become part of the routing network, those transactions can be private, and the broadcasting can be skipped.  But this is a niche case, and does not really support the dream outlined in the ""Lightning User Experience: A day in the live of Carol"" stickied at the top of the other sub. ",1525804495

The minimum fee rate for a basic transaction is 1000 sat/kB.  The median tx size for a basic transaction is under 300 bytes.  Therefore, the minimum fee for generating a single tx is roughly 300 satoshis, which is under $0.03 USD.  

Seeing as how the average block size is only 60 kB away from being at the 1MB limit, you'd only need to generate 60 kB worth of transactions (about 200 regular sized, basic transactions) to fill the blocks. Generate more than 60kB worth of transactions and you start to clog the mempool - assuming blocks are continuously filled to 94% of capacity.  Expensive is a relative word, and spending a few bucks in tx fees every few minutes for a day is not expensive (for me, at least).

"Different professional investors look for different characteristics for their investments.  Some seek illiquid and high-volatility investments because those markets are less efficient, and because they can often generate higher returns over time to compensate for the additional risk.

Bitcoin could be (it's probably too early to say for sure) an asset that will tend to move with low or negative correlations to traditional asset classes.  Many professional investors like to own assets with low or negative correlations to their existing holdings since doing so can lower the risk of their overall portfolio.  As bonds and stocks have exhibited higher correlations recently, managers are looking especially hard at assets that won't correlate with those two asset classes. 

I don't think professional investors, broadly speaking, are avoiding bitcoin because of volatility.  I think custody concerns and the imprecise nature of any valuation method are probably bigger concerns than the volatility, but a handful of professional investors are willing to dip their toes into the water.

"0xBitcoin's aim is to be Bitcoin, rebuilt on top of Ethereum. 

Ethereum and 0xBitcoin serve extremely different purposes, Ethereum was designed to secure the Ethereum network, 0xBitcoin was deployed to be a deflationary trustless currency and store of value on top of the Ethereum network. 

You see, Ether can't do the things ERC20 tokens can do... This is because ETH doesn't conform to its own ERC20 standard. Sure, you can have wEth, but that is just a bandaid. From the wEth homepage: ""Hopefully, there's no future for w-ETH."" Being deployed as an ERC20 token allows 0xBitcoin to be traded on decentralized exchanges, to directly interact with other ERC20 tokens, and to be utilized in smart contracts which run exactly as programmed without the possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud, or third-party interference. 

0xBitcoin acts just like Bitcoin, but it can utilize all of the power of the Ethereum network.

Ethereum is moving to POS for several reasons, like speed and scaling. Because 0xBitcoin is an ERC20 token it will benefit from all of these upgrades to the Ethereum network, but the two can't really be compared in that way. Ethereum isn't a token so that question seems a little confused, Ethereum isn't a token so why try to compare the two?

0xBitcoin is meant to be a pure currency on the Ethereum network. Not a utility token or anything else, just a trustless, decentralized currency. The 0xBitcoin project believes that the only way to achieve a trustless, decentralized currency is though a trustless, decentralized method of distribution, ICOs and Airdrops relay on some central actor to dole them out. 0xBitcoin does not. 

The mining in 0xBitcoin serves to distribute it in a trustless and decentralized manner. This distribution method is entirely transparent- all of the code is open and accessible to anyone who wishes to look it over. ICOs and Airdrops all have central actors, and that's fine for some projects, but you can't have a centralized actor in a decentralized, trustless currency. Lots of companies have used ICOs to raise funds... this will probably get them in trouble with the SEC here shortly... 

Like Bitcoin, 0xBitcoin doesn't have a company behind it, it's just a community of people.

0xBitcoin isn't trying to *steal* Bitcoins name, 0x are the first two characters in every Ethereum address. 0xBitcoin is Bitcoin, deployed on Ethereum. It's not trying to steal anything, it's trying to signify that this is Bitcoin, but on Ethereum. 0xBitcoin is a marriage of Bitcoin maximalist ideals to some degree, and Ethereum maximalist ideals to some degree. 0xBitcoin follows Bitcoin in every way that it can. 

You seem to hate the name but say that it wouldn't get any attention without it, from my experience I would say that it would be doing BETTER if it weren't named 0xBitcoin. People tend to have similar reaction as you when they first hear of it. Admittedly, my reaction was similar, but I took time to look into the what, the, why and the how behind it and I was able to see the reasoning. 

I disagree with you completely, and most likely theis will all have been a waste of breath, but I think this is the answer to most of the ICO and airdrop clutter we're seeing in the space. How many ICO scams have their been now?! You can fake addresses, you can fake people, you can't fake hashpower... 

""Plus aren't erc20 tokens just supposed to act like ""place holders"" for ICO projects until their main net launches??"" No. You don't understand the space very well if you think that's the main purpose of ICOs. Some select few yes, but most no.

I understand that 0xBitcoin is hard to grasp on several levels, as it's quite counterintuitive at first glance, but what's disturbing isn't 0xBitcoin, what's disturbing are most of the things considered going on in crypto today...

Correct it's only bitcoin when the LN smart contract confirms on the blockchain. 

If Money never confirms on the blockchain, then you don't need the blockchain. You will need to trust some other authority something other than Bitcoin PoW to secure the system. Bitcoin is secured by transaction fees paid to write transaction to the blockchain.

Satoshi designed the system, the only way to reconcile his discussions it to understand that if you want micropayments use a payment channel. Satoshi did not discourage the development of LN, rather saw it as a viable solution. Likewise, LN does not need limited on chain transactions to work,

Don't like the Bitcoin described in the white paper invest somewhere else don't destroy it by limiting transactions to 1MB and think payment channels are a smart solution. They are nothing but a side note in the bitcoin story not even mentions in the design descriptions. 

LN is offered as a solution to an edge case for adoption criticism.

"TL;DR Dash is a very innovative coin. They are the first to create Masternodes, to provide actual privacy (that has worked for 4 years), instant txs, governance and decentralized, censorship-free funding. Honestly, I think the pace of innovation at Dash is so fast, most people can't keep up. HOWEVER, this success breeds haters. There are 3 communities that have for whatever reason, FUDDED dash to hell since it released. Mostly because:

1. Dash does privacy better than every other coin (although PIVX is just about equal in that regard from my research)

2. Dash has self-funding and pioneered it. Which means those coins that fudded Dash can't adopt it, or they risk having to admit they were wrong/lying the whole time.

3. Dash is only focused on mass-adoption and shuns the crypto-infighting like BTC vs BCH. They barely even respond to XMR trolls or shill on here. 

Now, because of this, a large number of ppl in crypto think Dash is a 'scam'. And aside from vote-brigading pro-Dash posts down, they've convinced people that its not a good coin, so on this sub no-one really talks about it. But they will.

Case in point:

https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8ebssj/dash_commercial_on_my_jet_blue_flight/

Here is an example of the FUD for u/haramburgler

&gt;that's the sad part about things like DASH

&gt;tricking all those people who don't know better gives you a ton of money for marketing... to trick more people.

&gt;Hopefully 2018 is the year of the scam purge; Bitconnect going first was fitting, hopefully XVG and DASH next

Notice the strong, emotional language. 'Tricking people'? Oh my...Ton of money for 'marketing'? WOW That must really be a scam! Even though marketing is a tiny portion of the Dash treasury budget, most of the CORE proposals (there are proposals by many teams making Dash a truly, community driven, self funded DAO) funding goes to the 60+ market-rate salaried employees of Dash Core. 

So, to distract from these amazing achievements, they frame them as negatively as possible, fake news if you will. ",1525803914

"&gt; 0.01 BTC

1 BTC was worth $0.05 when he said that comment, so 0.01 BTC was worth $0.0005. That's about 5 Satoshis in BTC at today's price, or about 32 satoshis of BCH.

&gt;So, despite what most people in this sub will tell you, Satoshi himself told us that second layer solutions (like Lightning Network) are necessary for any transactions under 0.01BTC.

No, he did not. You cut off the rest of that thread.

&gt;Forgot to add the good part about micropayments.  **While I don't think Bitcoin is practical for smaller micropayments right now, it will eventually be as storage and bandwidth costs continue to fall.**  If Bitcoin catches on on a big scale, it may already be the case by that time.  Another way they can become more practical is if I implement client-only mode and the number of network nodes consolidates into a smaller number of professional server farms.  **Whatever size micropayments you need will eventually be practical.  I think in 5 or 10 years, the bandwidth and storage will seem trivial.**

&gt;I am not claiming that the network is impervious to DoS attack.  I think most P2P networks can be DoS attacked in numerous ways.  (On a side note, I read that the record companies would like to DoS all the file sharing networks, but they don't want to break the anti-hacking/anti-abuse laws.)

&gt;**If we started getting DoS attacked with loads of wasted transactions back and forth, you would need to start paying a 0.01 minimum transaction fee.**  0.1.5 actually had an option to set that, but I took it out to reduce confusion.  **Free transactions are nice and we can keep it that way if people don't abuse them.**

This confirms that by 0.01 BTC he meant in inconsequential amount, which at the time was $0.0005 or five-hundredths of one cent!

&gt;That brings up the question: if there was a minimum 0.01 fee for each transaction, should we automatically add the fee if it's just the minimum 0.01?  It would be awfully annoying to ask each time.  If you have 50.00 and send 10.00, the recipient would get 10.00 and you'd have 39.99 left.  I think it should just add it automatically.  **It's trivial compared to the fees many other types of services add automatically.**

&gt;&gt;Does including more slow down your hashing rate?  

&gt;No, not at all.

Also, he specifically said in the image you linked that:

&gt;**Bitcoin is practical for smaller transactions than are practical with existing payment methods.** Small enough to include **what you might call the top of the micropayment range.** But it doesn't claim to be practical for arbitrarily small micropayments.

So he considered $0.0005 to be the ""top of the micropayment range"" Bitcoin fees aren't even in the micropayment range anymore, according to his definition.",1525803808
"Honest question, what makes you think ETH will tank? Coinbase CEO says they are focusing a lot of effort on ETH this year and like them or not, they are probably the biggest player in the game right now.

"I will give you this, you are at least honest.

Too many LN supporters claim this will remove a large burden from BTC, but that it is still on-chain.

You at least admit that LN is for a different class of payment than most on-chain transactions and that LN transactions are not happening on-chain. Sure, settlement will, eventually.

Still makes no sense, why me, say, an online game company, with a bunch of microtransactions, would use LN to enable that, when there are simpler, cheaper and more reliably ways of doing it, but I guess it is an option and options are good.",1525803795

As far as taking over dex exchanges... They serve different purposes.  An exchange is a platform to buy and sell a VARIETY of crypto from a VARIETY of people.  Atomic swaps will work person to person and not all coins will be able to swap with each other.
Keep in mind there are also competitors that have ""on chain"" atomic swaps like LTC, BCH, DCR, VTC.  I'm not sure if they are all interchangeable because they use different forms of SCRIPT language to enable this.

"I never liked it, still don't, but it's one of an array of places to pick up ""a feel"" for what is happening and have an occasional laugh.


The problem sets in when people start to equate investing in crypto as some sort of ""community"" - really? The way I see it, is it's generally about making an investment - money. 
Call it a ""community"" if you want, but that equates to actually giving a shit about the other people who take participate. For me, I don't give a flying fuck - I get my real community elsewhere - friends, family. Investment and community, in my opinion, are not good bedfellows. Kinda like going into business with your friends, 9 times out of 10, it ends in a split.

"This idea that the average LN user would be opening and closing channels and controlling their own private keys I think is not realistic (and so ironically the way HTLC.me works is realistic). IMO, it will be the major hubs opening and closing channels and the users will simply have custodial accounts with these hubs. With this design, the users don't need to worry about on-chain fees OR worry about always being on-line to monitor for fraudulent stale channel-states being settled on the blockchain.

This design also lets the hubs engage in fractional-reserve banking.

In other words, LN would likely become a modernized version of today's bank system.

"White paper has been in the works for some time now and will be released before end of June. (important to note that a white paper is created for a theoretical product, VeChain has been a working blockchain since 2015 under BitSE; hence no need for white paper, sunny agreed to create one to appease investors) 

No code release: I understand it’s typical for crypto projects to have open sourced code; but it is by no means a reason to hate a project. Plenty of multi billion dollar companies have private code that you and I use everyday. I too would like to see more open source code though. 

Everything being labeled as partnership: not sure about this, if anything this is describing crypto in general. I would argue that VeChain is probably the best in this department, as PwC and DNVGL (along with others) already post and publish their own content on how they are using and implementing VeChain. 

Cringy stuff: to be honest, yeah, a bit cringy. I’m not in love with it, but the marketing isn’t why I invest. 

Verifying their devs is unfortunately the same as verifying any other companies devs. Just gotta go on LinkedIn and check around: they do post information on their site regarding the employees and have images posted of the team. 

Sunny was CIO at Louie Vuitton, and is currently CEO of VeChain. His LinkedIn currently shows him only as CEO. 

Again, you can dislike and hate VeChain, but I think there’s a more mature way of handling your disliking for something. Best of luck, appreciate the convo.

"1) I half agree with you here, but the same is true about BTC users, propaganda is a real bitch, at least one forum allows for uncensored conversation. Currently correct that LN isn't required, might be nice to have though for cross chain support. Might be better scailing solutions that don't involve LN at all though. It's just the solution BTC is working towards at the cost of keeping the network working reliably for current users. 

2) This would be the case for every other altcoin that decides to add LN style scailing. Assume your a BTC maximalist then or you really distrust the BCH developers. Cross chain support is something I see in the crypto future rather than everyone moving to BTC.",1525802486

"Before people will adopt Bticoin, most people need to use Bitcoin for merchant services. Where does this argument fall apart? People are already using it. 

Not everybody is going to switch overnight, just as they haven't switched over to Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash yet. If people can find value in using the technology they will adopt it and gradually transition to using it, but if it doesn't offer them an advantage over what they already have, they won't bother. That goes for both Bitcoin and LN btw. Users are not going to adopt cryptocurrency over Visa/Paypal unless there's a compelling reason to.

So far we've not really got the compelling reason. People involved in Bitcoin now are technologists, speculators and ecoanarchists. They're not the mass public.

In my opinion, the compelling reason people will want to get into cryptocurrency is to conduct micro-transactions. The current advertising model used on websites and apps is clearly failing and people are actively installing ad blockers. You now have publishers attacking their users for using ad-blockers, and they are not going to be sustainable that way. Simple to use micro-transactions would enable publishers to look at alternative ways to monetize their content.

Now if you're going to have micro-transactions stored on the blockchain, you are going to be making the most terribly inefficient system ever. It will cost many times more to store and propagate transactions than the transaction was even worth in the first place. What size blocks do you think you would need if billions of web users were conducing hundreds to thousands of micro-transactions every day, and on what planet do you think it would ever be a good idea to permanently store them all?",1525802060

"&gt; Just because it says the word cash in the abstract doesn't mean that it was referring to Bitcoin cash. 

Sorry, I used the title. It's a reference to the fact that Bitcoin should be able to be used as cash.

&gt;And Bitcoin right now is still fully compliant with the white paper. It covers all aspects mentioned with the exact same functionality, but with extra features. 

Added features? You mean like high fees, unreliable transactions, and everyone's coding projects?

&gt;Why is it no longer in line with the original idea? That part I don't understand at all.

Ok, these are from the white paper:

&gt;The network itself requires **minimal structure.** [The bloated Segwit, the perception that a LN is needed to scale, etc.] Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, **accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.** 

[You can't just leave and rejoin the LN at will, and with soft forks, you can't just take the longest PoW chain as the valid chain]

&gt;The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off **the possibility for small casual transactions,** and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non-reversible services.

Small transactions are impossible with high fees. Replace By Fee is a reversible transaction.

&gt;With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need.

You can't have anonymous transactions and reversible transactions, it just doesn't work.

&gt;What is needed is an electronic payment system **based on cryptographic proof instead of trust,** allowing any two willing parties to **transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.**

LN involves a multitude of trusted third parties.

&gt; In this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using **a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions.**

This basically affirms what Core denies, that the Bitcoin Network is run by the **miners,** and **NOTHING ELSE.** Because they ""generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions.""

And that's just the Abstract and Introduction!",1525801861

2) You are completely missing the point. I never suggested that LN is dependent upon segwit but that the codebases have significantly separated and becoming more and more different each week despite BCH still copying some of BTC new code.

To me this seems like a money grab, and doesn't bring any true value to the crypto space, it only clutters the space and confuses new people. 

Plus aren't erc20 tokens just supposed to act like ""place holders"" for ICO projects until their main net launches??

If that is the case does 0xbitcoin plan to have its own main net??

Also, the long range attacks section addresses why if a company decided to be corrupt it can be easily overwritten by the observation rules. Nonetheless, in ANY capacity, it is pseudo-random as to who will produce the block and the chain doesn't require 101 nodes to operate. So if a node is found to try and pass curropt data it can instantly be removed from the protocol.

You can't be serious. I voted with HASHPOWER not my ETH. The carbonvote was not a formal vote and more just to see where the community was.

No requirement of communications between block producers to reach consensus;

&gt;This attack sets the requirement to not only on the number controlled in an attack but, more importantly, on the assumption that the rebelling Authority Masternodes collude. In reality, the PoA consensus significantly increases the difficulty of carrying out such a 51% attack.

They say ""here's what a 51% attack is. We're vulnerable to it but it probably won't happen because the small number of nodes we select won't collude"".

This 1mb limit was originally put in by Satoshi to stop spamming of the network when it was worth much less, and he has stated blocksize increases are the way to go. Instead, Blockstream, who employ a few of the developers, and also had control of all the main community bitcoin channels, decided they wanted 2nd layer solutions, so they could keep fees high for a long time after (they're based in China, the miners were making a killing). Blockstream censored, banned and abused anyone who wanted XT (Gavins solution) - even though this was the majority preference, even by exchanges.

Taking it further, in the future there will be USD anchors and stable coins if you’d like to convert back to fiat. But with stellars pathfinder services and atomic transactions, you could send whatever you want from point A and when it reaches point B, it will be in the form the end user wants to accept. 

Example: you only accept Litecoin, I only have Mobius. I send you Mobius, stellars network sells Mobius for btc, then btc to ltc at cheapest possible rate and you get the end result ltc. ",1525798445

"BigHit was talking about Litecoin.  It is a fork of bitcoin, but it doesnt claim its the real bitcoin.  It's marketed on its strengths, faster transactions, faster block generation times and is used as a test bed for new features that could possibly implemented into bitcoin.

The community doesnt reject Litecoin.  Litecoin ends up getting supported in implementations meant for Bitcoin.  The community doesnt deride Charlie because he markets his coin on its merits and doesnt claim it is something that is not.

The only reason BCH is hated by the larger community is because of the LIES AND FRAUD being used to market it.  By hijacking bitcoin branded public channels like bitcoin.com, r/btc and @bitcoin and saying things like Bitcoin Cash is the ""real"" Bitcoin Roger is perpetrating a fraud.

My point was the community would not have an issue with BCH if you guys marketed on your strengths, but instead you choose to willfully misinform and misrepresent what BCH actually is.  You damage the reputations of the entire cryptocommunity through these lies that swindle new users.  The reason we hate Roger is he commits fraud and lies, and does so willingly.  It's not like he doesnt know what hes doing is wrong, it's that he doesnt care.  Plenty of people have told him to clean up his act and he refuses. This is a deliberate fraud meant to deceive.

If Roger could market BCH transparently on its strengths for what it isnt instead of lies about what it isnt, nobody would have a problem.  Instead he continues to perpetuate lies.  Litecoin markets itself on its strengths and as a result is supported by the community.  Nobody has an issue with that.

That is the issue.  Roger is a convicted felon committing fraud.  You guys support it.  You, by proxy, are an accessory to this crime.  Have some self-respect and stand up to this man.  If you really believe in BCH as a project you'll put pressure on Roger to clean up his act.  Tell us why BCH is better than Bitcoin, not that BCH is the ""real"" bitcoin.

Capacity of single channels does not necessarily mean anything anyway. If I want to pay say, 1 BTC to some node, but there's no single channel that has that capacity, there will be no reason I can't route 0.5 BTC through one route, and 0.5BTC through another route to cover the transaction, it will just mean paying double the fee, which is still tiny.

"&gt; If I write down my private key on a piece of paper and give it to you, is this proper money or a money substitute?

That would be a money substitute. A somewhat more realistic version of this emerging as a money substitute would be something like circulating Casascius coins where the private key is hidden behind a tamper-resistant sticker.  But accepting something like that as payment is obviously not going to have the same security guarantees as requiring an on-chain transaction. I have to trust that the issuer hasn't retained the private key and won't sweep the  funds at later date (I could sweep the funds myself immediately but that would obviously destroy ability of token to persist as a money substitute).  I also have to trust that the coin isn't just a convincing forgery with no private key, and that it hasn't been stealthily tampered with allowing a previous holder to steal the private key and replace the sticker.

&gt;If I give you a signed transaction that sends Bitcoin to an account owned by you, is this proper money or a money substitute? 

Releasing goods immediately in that case is obviously less secure than waiting until the transaction has been broadcast and confirmed. But  I'm not sure that's really a money substitute as it's not something that could continue to be used as payment in same condition following your receipt.  I mean I guess you could attempt to pay someone by giving them that unbroadcast transaction as well as another unbroadcast transaction of your own spending that output to their address, and then *they* could add to the unbroadcast chain when paying someone else, etc., etc...

&gt;What do you think about privacy / anonymity of on-chain transactions by the way? Even though Bitcoin is pseudo-anonymous in its current state, a world where billions of people are doing on-chain Bitcoin transactions for everyday purchases freaks me out. That's handing out insane amounts of metadata to whoever feels like abusing that in one way or another.

"It's not like this hasn't happened over and over and over so far in BTC history. Typically the ground floor ends up somewhere around 10x the ground floor of the previous pump. I.e. ~600 ground floor from previous pump, this one was 6500. 

Last time we went from 600 to 20k, a 33x. A similar pump would put us in that range 200-300k. 

Market cap at a BTC range like that could be somewhere around 18-30T, depending on BTC dominance.

I know it sounds a lot compared to today. Hell, a 10B market cap sounded ludicrous previously. Considering many hedge funds throw around 1-3T in money, each, it's really not that crazy to think that market cap (overall) could hit 30, 50, even 100T. When? certainly not this year, but in a few years, it absolutely could. 

More than that, there's so much money tied up in shitcoins, that once they all shake out, market cap could get cut in half and most people's portfolios would be completely unaffected. 

The thing is, right now nobody is using the stuff (hardly anyone). It's not inconceivable that in 10 years most transactions will occur using blockchain technology, even if simply in the background. I.e. merchant accepts BTC, OMG network DEX converts BTC to USD, transfers USD to merchant. Both parties don't even realize OMG functioning in the background.

That's the real potential of this technology.... which tech is going to function like TCP/IP, where people access the internet every day and use TCP/IP and don't even realize it. It's all happening in the background.

Get your new drivers license? The information is transmitted and stored on the blockchain, using OMG. New citizens card? Verified and processed using TKY on the NEO blockchain. 

The users don't even know these things are happening, but they blockchain is providing the security and auditability of these transactions, for a fraction of the cost to the retailer/distributer, etc.

Merchants get their money immediately, not in 14 days from Visa. They get it right away and with very minimal fees (less than Visa). 

That's when adoption happens. When that happens, 50T marketcap is an absolute joke. It's peanuts. 

Don't forget what the ceiling is here... it's literally the entire global economy. Will we hit 100%? We don't need to, but that's the ceiling.

"I'm not denying that Bitcoin adoption got ahead of the tech, both in terms of implementation by wallets/exchanges as well as development (of LN). But you're attributing the $50 fees to the tech, which is a faulty argument. Like I said, Segwit and batching were not implemented at major users of the network (particularly Coinbase). They have since upgraded to Segwit and improved batching processes. So, in other words, network participants were forced to use the network more efficiently, which is exactly what you'd expect/want to happen in this situation. 

But, sure, just tout big blocks like that somehow fixes the ongoing issue of spam (it doesn't). Just pretend like BCH has it all figured out (it doesn't) and pretend to not know that Segwit (by itself) is outpacing BCH, even at 8mb.

"I remember years ago when they were just giving it away to test their network and they said that XRP wouldn’t really be used as an asset. Now, all of a sudden it’s the greatest thing since sliced bread. They really just wanted to offer a service. They could have fixed the cost of XRP so it didn’t fluctuate and offered a great service to banks and financial institutions but they decided to start shilling their coin which no bank would ever buy under the disguise that it’s a crypto currency. They are really not invested in the currency aside from raising capital from buyers. In the end, they will sell the service, create a new crypto off of the tech that doesn’t fluctuate in price, and leave investors behind.

I think the amount of fees paid is a pretty good indicator for how much real economic activity is going on and the potential network effects that the blockchain is creating. People won't bother paying fees for low value transactions, so it automatically filters out a lot of noise.

"_Opt-in_ doesn't refer to the default client behavior when creating transactions. Rather it is about the ability for transactions to signal their intent to be replaceable at all. Even though Core changed the default transaction template, BIP125 RBF remains opt-in. If a transaction which has not signalled its replaceability is superceded by one with a higher-fee, it has not happened under the constraints of BIP125 RBF. 

Transaction replacement strategies are unenforceable conventions, independent of the consensus rules. Neither the BTC nor BCH networks can confidently distinguish between malicious and inadvertent replacement of unconfirmed transactions. By vilifying RBF, BCH misses out on the opportunity to demonstrate how it poses no additional risk to 0-conf transactions when sufficient block capacity minimizes backlog.

Even worse, transaction replacement was an intentional design decision that enables specific smart contract techniques. Unless the BCH user-base comes to realize that RBF is not the monster it's been made our to be, Satoshi's vision for implementing those contracts will have to be abandoned in favor of work arounds.",1525795247

"My thoughts are that innovation is great, but innovation is not happening at the rate we speak. Many ICOs do not plan to be decentralized, are not yet decentralized, some try to be but never end up being decentralized. 

So in that sense, Bitcoin will always remain one of the top contenders for being the most decentralized currency in the field. With that attribute alone, as that guarantees security, it is guaranteed to increase in value, whether you want that or not. 


__ 


You also neglect to acknowledge that ICOs/Altcoin can fail. Especially this ICO innovation thing is where I see lots of danger happening in the next 6 months. Explosion of such ICOs should result in Bitcoin receiving pumps, unless you believe people proceed to lose money and then invest into the next speculative thing, instead of the safe one. 


Innovation will happen and over years we might someone compete with Bitcoin. But right now nobody is remotely close to doing that. Ethereum should have flipped Bitcoin in December, but they didn't. 



____


I'm not saying you're wrong really. But I think the fight you assume to be over, is far from over. We're yet to see big implications of a successful LN. That will decide upon a lot of things I think. 

My critique towards current investors is that I think people like to give Bitcoin shit, because it does no ""innovation"", when the truth is the investor usually themselve has forgotten what the innovation actually was. The innovation was free decentralized money, that cannot be controlled, thus decentralization is the key innovation. 



All other use Blockchain may or may not bring remains to be seen, really. 



Thus I think there will for a long time be periods, where Bitcoin outperforms Alts, and Alts outperform Bitcoin. 

Also you need to acknowledge, that's not only the way around, in that Altcoins pump up Bitcoin guaranteed, but also the other way around. Bitcoin pumps up your Altcoins too. It's an easy to understand entry, it's safe and it's the place people usually start with, as per currently.",1525794293

"When governments peg a price, it's usually to the local currency they control in an attempt to keep citizens from rioting due to skyrocketing food prices. It's basically a last ditch effort to force prices down as the government creates inflation by printing money to pay off debts.

It shows up occasionally in wartime shortages too with somewhat better outcomes as the price fixing also comes with wage fixing and is short term.

Anyway, you're proposing that a government fix the price of something, maybe oil, in a currency they don't control. The moment bitcoin value increased relative to the global price of oil (or the global price of oil decreased relative to the global price of Bitcoin), the entire country's stock of oil would be purchased with bitcoins by any buyer willing to jump through hoops for a discount.

The moment Bitcoin decreased in value relative to the global price in oil, nobody would buy the oil -- they'd just buy from a different country -- and sellers would have to start paying buyers the difference if they wanted their tankers to leave full of oil on schedule.

Price fixing only ""works"" in a fully controlled economy where the government can force  sellers to sell at a loss or buyers to buy at a loss. This can sometimes be sustained for a while by asking people to sacrifice for the war, but it always feeds a black market and often leads to a full collapse of the official and taxed markets as price disparities grow larger and larger compared to untaxed black markets.

It ends up with cases like where goods officially have extremely low prices, but aren't available in any legal shop because anybody in the supply chain can ""lose"" the item (or sell it to a friend etc.) for 100x the fixed price.",1525794138

"&gt; There are, for example, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.  These function perhaps like money. Some of their creators and certainly some of their early adopters may have intended them to function that way, even though technological and regulatory barriers can make it tough for cryptocurrencies to serve as currency.[9] They may be currency, commodities, or something else, but it is unlikely that, on their own, they’re actually securities.
&gt; 
&gt; Then there are utility tokens that are designed to function much differently, at least at some point in their lifecycle.  These tokens may function as a means of executing a transaction, as a way to get access to a product or service or participate in a community, or in any number of ways that have yet to be dreamed up.   
&gt; 
&gt; And then there are tokens or coins used in initial coin offerings, or ICOs.  These look the most like securities.  Their creator sells them as a means of raising funds.  In one potential example, the issuer may want to build an environment in which the coins can be used—potentially as a medium of exchange, potentially as a means of executing or tracking exchanges—and sells the coins before the environment is built. The proceeds from the sales of tokens are used to build the system in which they will one day function. A coin that has no functionality at the time of sale will likely be cheaper to buy than one that offers entry into a fully realized environment.  After all, which would you pay more for: a token for an arcade that is laid out in broad terms in a white paper, or a token for an arcade where you can play Space Invaders right now?

* Masternodes add zero redundancy and zero resilience to the network, and the actual ""mixing"" has been questioned on multiple occasions. I have yet to see an analysis that determines the optional feature is worth crippling the miner profitability by 45%.

* Dash mining has been completely destroyed by these policies, and the computational security is a joke. The D3 is the only current Antminer on the market which barely turns a profit, the Dash shills blame Bitmain when the problem is clearly the broken incentive system.",1525793677

"&gt;On 8th August 2010 bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik wrote what could be mildly described as the biggest understatement since Apollo 13 told Houston: “We’ve had a problem here.”. “The ‘value out’ in this block is quite strange,” he wrote on bitcointalk.org, referring to a block that had somehow contained 92 billion BTC, which is precisely 91,979,000,000 more bitcoin than is ever supposed to exist. CVE-2010-5139 (CVE meaning ‘common vulnerability and exposures’) was frighteningly simple and exploited to the point of farce by an unknown attacker. In technical language, the bug is known as a number overflow error.So instead of the system counting up 98, 99, 100, 101, for example, it broke at 99 and went to zero (or -100) instead of 100. In layman’s terms, someone found a way to flood the code and create a ridiculously large amount of bitcoin in the process.

&gt;The fix was the bitcoin equivalent of dying in a video game and restarting from the last save point. The community simply hit ‘undo’, jumping back to the point in the blockchain before the hack occurred and starting anew from there; all of the transactions made after the bug was exploited – but before the fix was implemented – were effectively cancelled.

&gt;How serious was it? Bitcoin’s lead developer Wladimir Van Der Laan is pretty blunt about it, telling me: “It was the worst problem ever.”

"&gt; I suppose that won't be practical, right?

Which part are you asking about? Only mapping the entire network? It would be less resource intensive than a UTXO set covering billions of people. There will generally be only one hub or spoke per user. However, any single user is expected to have many unspent outputs. Additionally, there are ways to structure mapping data for efficiency. For example, there could be routes that got you as far as some particular geographical region, say China, before one needed information on every point. It's similar to opening a phone book when you need a plumber. You don't start at 'A' you go straight to 'P'.

&gt;but they either don't work on a big scale or bring the need of big bank-like hubs

As I explained, the concept of LN, in its entirety, is difficult to impossible to pull off in terms of being the only scaling solution for Bitcoin serving a majority of the world's population. There are aspects which are challenging, some not related to the difficulties of constructing workable software. For example, how would everyone be expected to commit to opening a channel which means an on-chain transaction in any case with questionable fee expense, then the consideration of security including the ability to close a channel when necessary to prevent fund loss but which requires another on-chain transaction under time pressure for resolution. Again this is quite apart from the difficulties I outlined earlier. So, yes, I agree that ""doesn't work on a big scale"" seems the obvious conclusion. However, that's not to say some problems in particular, for example, *just* the question of finding routes cannot be solved. 

I think LN may serve well for some niche financial use cases which would be applicable to many blockchain projects. So I'm glad if people keep working on it. However, to imagine it's a complete and workable scaling solution for the world's transactions as regards Bitcoin I think is a stretch, that likely to be an understatement.",1525792664

"I think you've misunderstood my position.

All of this is a small stepping stone for the end game. Many people in IRC channels and Reddit, and many other social forums were talking about much bigger and better things than just getting on a legitimate fiat exchange back in 2014.

You have to remember that this technology is born out of a culture of crypto-anarchy and for many early adopters would spell the end of statism.

Part of that is the state breaking bread with the new tech in hopes to regulate and profit off of it, which they will do for a while...until enough people have adopted it and realize that there isn't really shit the state can do.

And the more that happens, the harder the state will clamp down on it. I honestly don't see bitcoin surviving that, as it is already fairly easy to de-anonymize bitcoin transactions with enough compute power. But the importance of bitcoin will always be as the first attempt that proved it was possible. There have been better blockchain systems built since bitcoin that have been informed by the weaknesses found in bitcoin under state scrutiny of users of bitcoin. I do see bitcoin surviving as a bridge between ""legitimate"" state crypto and the much larger ""system-d"", global, agorist economy that has developed (and growing rapidly) as a result. That bridge will only be useful as long as there is a state to make that bridge useful.

It will only get harder for the state from that point on.

Brave is faster than chrome, will eventually pay the user, integrate TOR tabs, and overall provide a much better experience.  
I will agree that facebook and google will still have no problem making money, when you deal with a company that makes money on the level that google and facebook do. They have massive massive amounts of data on people, and they will always have value. Data is the new oil, and Facebook and Google will continue to grow.

We know the NSA tracks everything we do, but most people still live their lives just the same as they did before. If we would have found out the government was spying on us in the 80s, we would have had protests like in Vietnam when we found out the government wasn't the friend we thought it was. But now a days, finding out how much these companies track you is just par for the course. Sure a little blip in the radar left using facebook after the Cam. An information came out. But people really didn't care, ma and everyone I know still use facebook. I tried using other search engines after I found out about google, but they just weren't as good, so often I cheat back to using google.

People Ctrl Shift N on chrome and sure nothing saved on the local device's history, it doesn't compare to the blocking that brave can offer.  
I believe this product will face mass adoption one day for sure. Between the CNBC partnership and Townsquare partnership this will face mass adoption, not to mention the strong likelihood of a coinbase addition and integration of other browsers like Firefox and Opera. ",1525792318

"Bitcoin blocks have become larger, up to 4x larger without changing the consensus rules. Which resulted in the current low fees. But larger blocks are not a real  long term solution to tx fees. Larger blocks will fill up and the problem will reoccur over and over, until blocks become so large, so you have something more akin to Ripple than Bitcoin.  We need smarter solutions. Lightning Network is one good attempt at providing a smart scalable solution.

Bitcoin seems to have been expertly and meticulously crippled by a purposeful long term plan. Bankers, government, corporations? I think the efforts began well before Blockstream became prominent, and Blockstream conspiracy theorists are probably mistaken, looking for an easy finger to point. Yet, I think today's BTC is the result of that plan completing successfully.

1\) The whitepaper assumed that Bitcoin might scale with SPV nodes\(light clients that don't validate all the consensus rules\) with something called Fraud alerts or fraud proofs . These have never existed and may never properly exist , thus reinforcing the importance of validating your own txs with a full node as trusting a third part is not using p2p cash by definition and is less secure 

2\)  Many Bcash supporters care less about security , de\-emphasize the importance of full nodes , and promote the idea that we should just trust the miners to do the right thing instead of having economic users validate the txs and keep the miners in check. 

3\) The article I linked makes the assumption that Bitcoin or Bcash scaling in a far more centralized and less secure way as a hypothetical and does the math to see if it could scale with almost all users using light clients 

4\) The math shows it cannot scale with this assumption due to the demand on the servers serving SPV clients

They've decided to keep it exactly the same, but take a page out of the Orbs book and implement a federated system, where the ecosystem apps run the nodes, so they can make the transactions free. The apps get highly rewarded from the KRE, so this tradeoff is possible.

Eventually, they will probably move to Orbs, as Orbs in many many times more scalable than Stellar.

"I've noticed that basically CoinmarketCap has become **absurdly influential** in the cryptocurrency sphere. It's actually insane how much power they hold now over the whole market.

It has become the de-facto resource for most people to get cryptocurrency market related information. According to Alexa it's ranked 184 globally and 161 in the USA. Let that sink in. That's how big CoinmarketCap is. It is a top 200 site worldwide.

It is basically a small project to list all cryptocurrencies that turned into an absolute giant which can influence the whole market and it has done so with barely any conversation at all about its role, only when they changed the weighting of the market once (removing KRW weighting on price) and caused a minor market crash.

It's also a misleading site in general because for simplicity, they display all of the prices in dollars but the reality is that most cryptocurrencies cannot be bought/sold for dollars, so what you're seeing is not the actual price of the cryptocurrency, it's the price of the cryptocurrency if it's sold for Bitcoin and then for dollars. This is a somewhat weird way to look at what is essentially currently a FOREX market...but that's how all of these indexing sites have now evolved.

Sure they disclose this on the website at the bottom of the page but given the amount of people on this subreddit I see posting on a daily basis who don't know about this, clearly it's not working very well.

&gt;  
&gt;The node might be killed by the operating system kernel.

There is no evidence that more fraudulent double spending occurred than before.

You made up the name ""fractional-teller banking"" for a specific attack vector 

I did coin the phrase yes. As a pithy descriptor / analogy for one specific failure mode.

(one that only vaguely resembles something like a bank run) 

The parallels seem pretty obvious to me.

&gt;and you use that to conclude that as an argument for LN being a banking layer? 

Well understanding the analogy should help you understand why LM is a “banking” layer. When you consider the topology of the LN that’s likely to emerge (i.e., a relatively small number of highly-connected, highly-capitalized “hubs” and many more far-less-connected, far-less-capitalized “spokes”) that should also drive home why the “banking” label is apt. But there’s no reason to get hung up on the label. The more fundamental point is that “second-layers” are necessarily imperfect money substitutes for money proper (in Bitcoin’s case, on-chain transactions).

&gt;Seems a bit far-fetched to me.

Systemic failure becomes less and less far-fetched and eventually inevitable the more highly “leveraged” the system is, i.e., the more the base (blockchain proper) is constrained relative to the layers operating on top of it. As an extreme example, imagine a LN handling 50 billion tx per day operating atop a base blockchain capable of processing only 300,000 tx per day. Well you can’t, because obviously the system would have failed long before you’d ever get to that absurd a level of leverage.

&gt;Anyway, regarding the attack vector where an attacker sets up lots and lots of payments channels and then tries to close them all at once ... you do know that the defenders can use RBF while the attacker can not? 

Neat, but that doesn’t fix the fundamental issue.

&gt;But all things considered, the security model is different, I agree.

Great.

&gt;So is the security model for ""0-conf"" transactions by the way.

Of course.

&gt;I don't think LN is a magical free lunch that solves all problems. I see it as an application layer that lives on top of Bitcoin, not as some sort of complete replacement for Bitcoin. It will be useful / necessary for certain kinds of applications, and for other applications it will not be.

Agreed although I’m skeptical that the LN in particular will ever prove to be terribly useful.

&gt;On-chain scaling can also be achieved by compressing transactions rather than increasing block sizes. 

Probably but with rapidly diminishing returns. You’re certainly not going to get a 100x or 1000x increase in capacity by tweaking transaction format.

&gt;Personally I think that compression techniques should be exhausted first.

Personally I think that whatever you do it should be sufficient in scope, and done timely enough, to prevent the kind of degradation of network performance that reached a zenith on the BTC chain in December and that is still afflicting that chain. ",1525790416

Because whether or not you agreed with it, it was imposed on you.

&gt; The rules I agreed to when buying BTC have remained unchanged to me.

No, now 100% of your capital is stored on a blockchain that enables P2SH.  Hope P2SH doesn't cripple the blockchain, because if it does you're going down with the ship.

&gt; If BTC had hard forked in P2SH and 95&amp;#37; of the value was now on the ""upgraded"" fork. 

Then you would have a set of coins on a P2SH enabled blockchain worth 95% of your original value and another set of coins on a blockchain that follows the rules that you originally agreed to worth 5% of their original value.

In your case you were ""pro-P2SH"" so you could have additionally sold your stake in the original chain and increased your stake in the P2SH chain.

Optionally you could have held on both chains.  If P2SH had turned out to have a crippling defect, you'd be covered.

The EDA period where Bitmain was mining several blocks per minute can easily be considered a pre-mine, particularly since EDA was removed once the Bitmain cartel was able secure their stash (although it lives on in the original Bcash chain). There's not really any debate that Bitmain played a huge role in stonewalling Segwit activation for nearly a year. It's also common knowledge that Bitcoin isn't really a part of their long-term strategy and they have invested millions into machine learning asics. The only ""BU nodes"" that didn't crash were almost definitely standard Bitcoin nodes with BU user agent strings. Other exceptions may include BU nodes that were segregated behind Bitcoin nodes, although those probably crashed too. You can go back and read the articles preceding the creation of Bcash. Even Bitcoindotcom declared that Bcash 'veered off' to create new tokens. So yes, clearly a lot of revisionist history is underway. The whitepaper describes using POW to resolve transaction ordering. It does not imply that POW is used to determine chain validity in a contentious hard fork situation. If it did, then Bitcoin would be broken. Luckily, Bitcoin is not ruled by miners, despite the fact that mining is still pretty centralized. I don't buy anything you say regarding what miners believe.

Then you change the 2 back to a 1. Compare this to something like segwit where the change is 10,000 lines of code. If something goes wrong you have to be an expert to know which of those 10,000 lines the error is occurring. 

BY the way, these multiple implementations aren't actually independently developing code. They are copy+pasting code from each other. When the ABC developers code a new feature, the Unlimited devs copy+paste the code into their own code.

The end result looks more like a realtime Facebook newsfeed (or Tweetdeck) than a traditional block explorer. You can use it for many different purposes:

1. Monitor the entire blockchain for OP_RETURNs in realtime
2. Track keywords like Tweetdeck (Example: https://chainfeed.org/filter/bitcoin)
3. View all your OP_RETURN transactions across multiple OP_RETURN protocols in a single place (Example: https://chainfeed.org/@1A85VU9gnXEuVwhFzvupmxc81hp8q5yfxx)

Some highlights:

1. Data-only: Unlike traditional blockchain explorers, Chainfeed is built from scratch to ONLY specialize in transactions that contain data (OP_RETURN transactions).
2. Profile: Try clicking on any account link, it will take you to a ""profile"" page, which contains a comprehensive log of all OP_RETURN transactions for that address. Even if you signed up to multiple apps (or protocols) using the same address, you should see the ""activities"" from ALL of those apps show up on the feed. Think of it like a Facebook activity feed, but for Bitcoin.
3. Avatars: The avatars are auto-generated from each user's address using a random avatar generator in order to ensure cross-application visual identification.
4. LIVE Filter: The search bar lets you filter the incoming live feed. The filtering currently takes place purely on the frontend in order to minimize centralization.
5. Shareable and Bookmarkable: Every filter query and every Bitcoin address has its own feed and the corresponding permalink that can be shared and bookmarked.
6. Apps: There are currently two tabs: ""all"" and ""featured apps"". ""All"" is the raw OP_RETURN feed. ""featured Apps"" is for applications that have their own overlay application protocols (such as memo.cash or blockpress so far). It's still early days so there aren't many apps that make use of the OP_RETURN data transaction feature yet, but we will probably see a lot of exciting apps soon..
7. Modular: The feed is basically a collection of ""cards"". The cards are constructed on-the-fly by parsing the incoming raw transactions on the frontend using custom modules, each written in a single JavaScript file.

There are some nifty things you can do if you play around with the site. Please try it out, and I would appreciate feedback!",1525788222

"A lie?  

Allow me to quote from Brian Armstrong (CEO of Coinbase) blog when he met with Greg and asked him compromise:

——-

Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase on the Core devs at the Satoshi Roundtable in 2015:

*”Some of them show very poor communication skills or a lack of maturity — this has hurt bitcoin’s ability to bring new protocol developers into the space.”*

*”They prefer ‘perfect’ solutions to ‘good enough’. ***And if no perfect solution exists they seem ok with inaction, even if that puts bitcoin at risk.***
They seem to have a strong belief that bitcoin will not be able to scale long term, and any block size increase is a slippery slope to a future that they are ***unwilling to allow***.”
Even though core says they are ok with a hard fork to 2MB (they have it on their own roadmap, just very far in the future), ***they refuse to prioritize it***. 

They prefer to withhold something that could help the network now, because ***they don’t trust the community to make educated decisions in the future***. 

They view themselves as the central planners of the network, and protectors of the people. ***They seem ok with watching bitcoin fail, as long as they don’t compromise on their principles.***

"Honestly, if this is an accurate representation of the normal experience, the all the better. If we’re really interested in the idea of Bitcoin succeeding then we want all the best implementations and versions competing.

"If we can't reproduce, we have nothing. (is like ""pics or it didn't happen haha)
Yeah, of course it is reproducible IMO. I mean, we all can take some BCH and some BTC and make a transaction, and then compare it. The time it takes to be done, the fees. I mean, is not like something someone told us. If something we can reproduce and see it for ourselves.",1525788085
"Def not. I agree, BCH May Be more efficient. But the value of bitcoin is in the fact that it cannot be changed. That lasts forever in time, set in stone since the first genesis block. So even if other things get better and fork bitcoin, it will ALWAYS be the original vs the other thing that will make it “better”. I would wait the hour to be 100%. 99.9% assurance isn’t good enough for me I’m an asian parent just kidding I dropped out of college with a 1.7 gpa who cares...

"&gt; There are clear and valid reasons why BCH exists

&gt; but it became abundantly clear over several years of deliberation with Blockstream that it wasn't going to happen

the double standard in your message isn't separated even by a dozen words.

either you accept that BCH and BTC have valid reasons to choose the scaling strategy they did or you are being intellectually dishonest here

&gt; Calling it a scam and money grabbing attempt with no validity to the arguments isn't helping anybody. 

this has to be addressed separately. i agree that BCH has a reason and right to exist. i disagree that the way it was forked off bitcoin chain and the way they are handling naming of their project is not indicative of ulterior motives in people behind BCH.

first there was the spam attack in the midst of blocksize debate exactly year ago. it is clear that was a spam attack, it only takes a glance at mempool size over that interval. the goal was to sway public opinion and get enough miner support to make the fork succeed, which would grant ver/csw/jihan authority over bitcoin project that they never had.

then there was a failed segwit2x upgrade attempt clearly designed to destabilize the network by making nodes pretend they follow consensus rules that they didn't.

and finally over last couple months we've seen the swift manouvering from ""Bitcoin Cash"" to ""Bitcoin (BCH)"" to ""the real Bitcoin"".

all these are indicative of the scammy nature of ver's/jihan's enterprise and undermine the real reasons for BCH to exist.",1525788022

&gt;Anyway, he wanted to use BCH at first. His project however was the prime example for how there is unbounded demand for virtually free transactions.

If we lived in some bizarro universe where your friend’s idea weren’t completely shitty and was instead wildly successful with millions of people every day making separate on-chain transactions for the privilege of purchasing individual M&amp;M’s from a vending machine then yeah, that might support the case that there is almost “unbounded demand for virtually-free transactions.” But that’s not this universe. In this universe, it took Bitcoin approximately 8 years just to begin filling up itty-bitty 1-MB blocks despite the fact that its transactions were, for the vast majority of that time, “virtually-free.” And in this universe Bitcoin Cash has enjoyed “virtually free” transactions for the nine months since the split and its blocks are on average still less than 100kb.",1525787995
"Well that is what I am doing, I know LN will create BTC into fully centralised crypto. It is already centralised in code ""development"" (more like lack of it) and with miners getting less fees because LN making people not use BTC any more (if LN ends up being able to do this) its game over for BTC, it will most certainly not change the world for the better.

If you are hoping BTC with people using LN will change the world for the better, you are looking in the wrong crypto.",1525787964

"I'm going to quibble with the ""Fungibility"" line. In terms of fungibility:

Gold: High
Fiat: Mixed (Paper: High,though slightly lower than Gold), Electronic: Low)
BTC: Moderate
BCH: Moderate

Fungibility means the ability of one unit of currency to be as good as another. In practice, this ends up being the same thing as *traceability* because if you can trace money there will be people who can and will refuse it based on who it is coming from.

You can melt gold down and conceal its origin. Paper bills have serial numbers but no one ever checks them, and they're accepted everywhere.

Digital transfers of fiat, though -- credit cards can easily block merchants they don't like. Ever hear of a drug dealer taking credit card payments?

Both BTC and BCH are pseudanynoums -- there's no certainty who an address belongs to, but the transactions of a given address are public. That means if you do nail down an address' owner (maybe that person bought something and provided a shipping address) suddenly there's no privacy. 

Yes, there are coin mixers to conceal the origin of coins. However there is a problem: everyone who bothers to use one has a reason to conceal the origin of their coins. You're likely to get something back as bad if not worse than you started with. Unless everyone always used mixers for every transaction, they aren't too helpful.

I'd love to see a good solution to this problem incorporated into Bitcoin Cash. However, let's not delude ourselves into thinking this is a solved problem, just because we have coin mixers. It isn't. At all.

Bitmain did not ""pre-mine"" Bitcoin Cash at all. After the fork they allocated hash power to the Bitcoin Cash fork - which was open and free for anyone to do, it was not a private ""pre-mine"". This is not pre-mining in any sense of the word and it is deceitful to brand it as such. The correct way to think about it is that Bitcoin was headed _politically_ in a direction Bitmain did not like and they used their economic freedom to support a fork that was more palatable for them.

Voting is done with hash power.

&gt; No, they created Bcash to have a SHA256 alternative to Segwit which was compatible with covert asicboost.

This ASIC boost is just a big fuzz about nothing. Has it _ever_ been documented that it has actually been used? Outside of a test environment? Even Slush pool supports Asicboost.

 &gt; But the point is that Bcash miners are mostly part of the Bitmain cartel

I see the same names in the hash rate distribution for both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. Again, if it wasn't exactly the same miners allocating hash rate based on price it is _impossible_ that the hash rate could track the price ratio so closely at 1:1.
And even if, at the time of writing, Bitmain should directly and indirectly control a larger share of hash power than other? Its completely free for anyone to compete with them, they are even selling the hardware to compete with them. If Bitcoin Cash gains in popularity more and more people will mine it reducing the dominance of Bitmain. 

&gt; monopolistic behavior and stonewalling technical progress

Obviously not true. They may be stonewalling technical progress which _you_ like and they don't. That is the right of every individual and organisation. Bitmain has been a driving force in hardware development and seed money to dozens / hundreds of startups. They have done _much_ more for bitcoin than most and have been a pioneer helping to spread economic freedom.

&gt; Did you completely forget about the whole ""Bitcoin Unlimited"" period where literally every single BU node crashed simultaneously, knocking their entire node network offline?

""every single"" is not true. Just a lot of them. And that nodes crash does not cause loss of funds. I was around when Bitcoin had to roll back when someone managed to conjure billions of Bitcoin into existence. Should we just toss the entire development team for Bitcoin away too?

If this was such a grave incidence confidence would have been completely lost. As it turns out confidence was not lost, and has grown ever since and more of the original Bitcoin crew has joined.

&gt; if you go back and read the press briefings

Me thinks that there are noe ""press briefings"". Bitcoin Cash is akin to Bitcoin in that noone and everyone can speak on its behalf. Why don't I just issue a ""press briefing"" that Bitcoin and everyone associated with it are Marxists? And then slam you with the ""fact"" that you are a Marxist? This is not revisionist history - Its in the original whitepaper explicitly describing the mechanism how to determine what is Bitcoin. Bitcoin just took some _political_ choices with tech and people that was so far away from a large part of the participants that something had to be done to satisfy Mr. Market.

&gt; pretending ""the market is still deciding"" is a bit delusional.

Mr. Market disagrees with you. Currently there is around 30.000.000 TH on the Bitcoin chain and 5.250.000 TH on Bitcoin Cash. This translates into a staggering 2.1 Million S9 miners on the Bitcoin chain and around 18% as many, 375.000 at Bitcoin Cash chain. 375.000 miners is not a delusion. That many miners in an _enormous_ investment and commitment to have dedicated on Bitcoin Cash. For most the people who owns those 375.000 miners its about ideology. They belive in economic freedom, capitalism, liberty, that transactions should be affordable by all, and accessible through the simple and proven interface of the blockchain. Do you know why miners mine Bitcoin? Because its profitable. As soon as its more profitable to mine anything else, they switch. In other words, its not about ideology.  That is why the Bitcoin Cash chain didn't die off at the first sign of trouble and which is why it will prevail.

&gt; You have your own token. 

Me personally hodl both. As it was anticipated in the white paper there is probably going to be some friction and that hash power should sort it out. Im 100% certain that the chain providing _most economic freedom_ will prevail. I'm pragmatic which chain this will be in the end, so i hedge my bet by hodling all until the dust settles. 

&gt; Get lost and stop trying to ride on the coattails of Bitcoin.

Why should i get lost? Just because for a fraction of Bitcoins existence i'm in disagreement with you? Why don't you get lost for supporting ideals that are diametrically opposed to the intent of Bitcoin? 

The competition that _should_ have happened was that On and Offchain transactions should have competed against each other on the same chain. That would have been civilized and a correct price for on chain transactions should be discovered thus enabling a market for Off chain transactions. Instead a faction hijacked the entire chain using coercion to bypass market mechanisms already established in Bitcoin to sort things like this out. That was not cool dude, and those actions are the only reason the entire community is so divided. ",1525786784

"You know, there can never be a block size increase consensus. Viabtc, coingeek, bitcoin.com and many large mining pools are mining BCH and do not want BTC crippled coin to compete because of blockstream. If blockstream tries to change BTC, all those mining pool will put hashpower into BTC and overwhelm the new fork, causing it to become an altcoin. Hence that's why s2x failed because the miners didn't want BTC to compete with BCH. Our focus is to fork away from blockstream censorship and improve based on miner voting, development, small fees, big blocks and eventually enabling all OP codes.

Just 2 months ago, core developers were trying to change POS to prevent mining pools from having the power to stop their cripple coin from changing, Jihan immediately warned core shills that the new altcoin that Blockstream tries to fork will get abandoned by miners and will not survive the fork with 10% hashpower left. https://mobile.twitter.com/JihanWu/status/967241694109302785

BTC is already doomed, they cannot fork to improve as long as viabtc, Bitcoin.com, Calvin Arye and the large miners continue to support BCH. Any attempts to fork and improve BTC will get demolish by the sheer hashpower of the mining farms and becomes an alt so that BTC remains crippled and cannot compete while BCH keeps improving.

I guess if I'm a large miner, my focus would be to improve BCH as soon as possible and build up a strong foundation until the bankers, stock exchanges and mainstream goes into BTC, then I'll collaborate with other large BCH miners and probably abandon BTC abruptly and screw over those bankers and Wall Street guys who are looking for BTC moon. That's the purpose of BTC to begin with, screw those Wall Street guys, then focus hashpower into BCH and let BTC die off with Wall Street holding on to useless BTC coins. It'll be ironic that BTC that was made to overcome Wall Street end up screwing wall Street by letting them own useless crippled coin, and there's nothing they can do about it because wall Street doesn't own Asics, they have 0 control over the survivability of BTC when miner consensus had been reached.",1525786443

&gt;**The Aftermath**  
&gt;  
&gt;Bitcoin would eventually recover. Users who became frustrated at the extreme unreliability would give up and stop trying to spend their coins. Many coins would make it to an exchange wallet and stay there. Node operators would make their nodes auto\-restart. SPV wallets would find some trustworthy central authority to get fee data from.  
&gt;  
&gt;Most importantly, the overload would eventually go away …. because the users would go away. The backlog would clear. Fees would fall to the minimum again.  
&gt;  
&gt;So life would go on.  
&gt;  
&gt;Bitcoin would survive.  
&gt;  
&gt;But it would have lost critical momentum. It would have become the MySpace of digital currencies. The faithful would have lost a lot of faith, and businesses that were trying to bring Bitcoin to the mainstream would “pivot” towards something else.

"So from what I understand you gotta picture it like this.

Think of a stock/asset as an iceberg. 90% of it is underwater, 10% is ""floating"". Those 10% are what people are currently trading, and it correlates directly to Volume.

The importance of float comes from the fact that an asset's current monetary value is defined by what the latest trades have been saying. This is specially relevant to Crypto because *the only thing that defines any coin's value is the float* (in other words, what people have been agreeing the price is). Bitcoin works the same if its priced at 10 cents or 10 million, the price is irrevelant to the tech, unlike a stock/shares where their price has a more direct meaningful impact on how it conducts business.

This is why Tether seems fishy as hell. Since only float defines the value behind cryptos, artificially pumping the float would have no consequences other than watching the numbers go high. Same with artifically dumping the float.

In very simple terms now: float is the trading amount that is currently defining the trading value.

"I still don’t understand how bitcoin is a “Threat” to banks.  

As far as I’m aware bitcoin does not earn any interest.  And I don’t believe anyone is lending bitcoin to buy houses cars etc.  Maybe as a payment system as opposed to debit/credit cards. But those fees are a fraction of earnings. 

Banks don’t profit by holding money in a vault. They “borrow” from depositors and earn from the float between what they pay and income from loans.  If bitcoin replaces US$ or € then banks will just modify systems to support that. Instead of buying a car for 30K US. They just loan you 5 bitcoin and still charge interest.  

Such a childish comment.  All you are doing is changing who’s names is on the fees you pay for a transaction. 

Anyway you also forget that Bill Gates at least recognized several changes in tech and rose to meet them. 

GUI’s - Windows after crushing the market with DOS. Apple copied from Xerox first but was beat so badly by MS a cash influx from MS is the only thing that kept them going. Jobs owes his place in history partly to Bill Gates. 

Networking - when companies started networking PCs and servers he came out with Windows server and that ecosystemKilled Novell and a bunch of other network companies that had 90% penetration. 

Internet - originally windows has no IP stack. He realized and corrected. Pivoted development to the internet. 

Browser - IE wasn’t on Windows originally. Netscape (now Mozilla/Firefox) had 90% of the market. He fought that back and won for years. 

Cloud - kind of after him but MS is kicking butt in cloud deployments. 

So while I don’t like Bill Gates or his business practices, he recognizes game changing moves in technology and combats them.  He’s a smart guy and it’s pretty stupid to discount him.

"Are you actually serious? Have you done a single minute of research?

Bitcoin XT was Gavin Andreson's solution to Bitcoin scaling problems. He proposed that we simply increase block size LIMIT, that was put as a temporary defense against spamming the network when BTC was worth so little you could very cheaply kill it without this limit in place.

Satoshi passed down lead development to Gavin Andreson.

Everyone liked Gavins solution, but Blockstream wanted to make money off of this, so they instead (owning most of the main community channels for bitcoin supporters), decided to censor XT supporters, ban them, publicly speak badly about exchanges who also said they'd follow the XT fork, and DDOSd miners who mined that fork solution. This allowed them to control bitcoin development, to keep fees high and their mining farms in China very rich.

What bitcoin XT proposed, is now Bitcoin Cash.

Just because you arrived late then saw that there was something called Bitcoin, and people trying to say Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin because its what the community wanted and closer to what Satoshi made "", and you thought that was a spam attempt because you know no better, does not mean it was.

Please, I challenge you to just be open minded and read the history because this is all factual and verifiable. Blockstream controlled the narrative. It's all provable.

They're literally both the exact same problem, one chose to use 2nd layer solutions and make a ton of money from fees, the other chose to increase block size to make it continue to scale AS IT ALWAYS HAD. Bitcoin Cash is far more usable as an actual peer to peer electronic cash, and it was what the community wanted.

And I only recently found this all out (check post history) and it made me quite mad that I'd falling for major companies controlling what people think. ",1525782124

"Imagine this scenario; hardly anyone runs a node anymore. Only exchanges and miners and a few big players. You run light clients or use wallet services that connect to the nodes of those big players. Those big players come together, decide to implement some change to the consensus rules. Say something to comply with government regulation that identifies all users, or something that increases the block reward so miners make more bitcoin, whatever. In reality it will be more subtle of course, but just as dangerous. That change requires a hard fork, and thus ""upgrading"" the software to their new software.  The cabal upgrades their nodes, and you cant do anything about it, your light client which connects to some big player's server now accepts those new rules. Your bitcoins just became something else. Old clients, running the original code will reject the changes, will not confirm these transactions, will not propagate those blocks. Thats a hardfork. If there is virtually no one on the ""old"" fork of the chain, because no one runs the old nodes, it becomes an irrelevant fork that isnt accepted anywhere, isnt traded anywhere, and the cabal just successfully hijacked the protocol. 

This almost happened last year in the segwit2x debacle where a cabal of miners, exchanges and payment integrators decided to change the rules. Wether those new rules where better or not is irrelevant, the fact is the only thing that stopped them was ordinary users refusing to ""upgrade"", running ""old"" nodes that where incompatible with their proposed changes. 

Ethereum classic is a similar story, I cant believe you wouldnt know about that. One group wanted to change the rules to revert a large loss of ethereum to a hacker who exploited a bug in a contract. They released a new, backwards incompatible client to achieve that reversal. That client and the resulting fork gained wide, but far from universal support and is now called ethereum, whereas the original chain and rules are called ethereum classic.

If you can run such a node on - let's say - a Raspberry Pi then being online 24/7 is not much of a problem. Watchtower functionality is - as far as I'm aware - not included in any of the LN clients yet but I doubt the cost to hire one will be high. Otherwise I'll give you a special deal ;)

It's already becoming difficult to visualize the network so not sure how you conclude that it's a hub and spoke model. What metrics do you use here?

Also, you compare sending Bitcoin to a friends wallet to having that friend buy Bitcoin himself and opening up a Lightning channel. I'm pretty sure that you'll be able to directly fund a channel with your friend (there's a beta version of a LN wallet for Android but if I remember correctly it cannot be used to receive payments at this moment).

And yeah I read that Lightning Labs post about user experience. I don't think waiting two hours or more for a one-time setup is that bad. If you receive some ""normal' Bitcoin for the first time, most wallets require several confirmations before you can spend them so you'd have to wait for like an hour anyway. ",1525779862

"I think I can explain it. Full Nodes are the synced bloclchain. The ledger file that we all share. When you don't run a full node you rely on someone else's full node. So ideally you should use a full node as your wallet or use a wallet that let's you reference your own full node.

Lightning network works in a peer to peer way. So (starting with 1 Bitcoin for all) a payment from Bob to Alice, through Carrol since they don't have a channel open to each other but have a channel with carrol would look like : Bob and Carrol sign in a multisig transaction that Bob has 0 Bitcoin and Carrol has 2 Bitcoin, while Carrol simultaneously signs a multisig transaction with Alice with one that states Carrol has 1 Bitcoin and Alice has 2 Bitcoin. For the overall effect of Bob has 0, Carrol has 1, and Alice has 2.

 Have you ever signed a transaction offline and then pushed it to the network? Say you use an offline computer or a hardware wallet. The signing offline and exchanging these transactions is what 2nd layer is. It's signing a multisig offline in a peer to peer (to peer to peer to peer etc if not directly connected) and then submitting to the Bitcoin network later. The difference is you must commit the Bitcoin on chain first, so that they can't be spent after you signed them to someone else.

however requires the double coincidence of wants. People
only upload files they are downloading, and once the

"You made up the name ""fractional-teller banking"" for a specific attack vector (one that only vaguely resembles something like a bank run) and you use that to conclude that as an argument for LN being a banking layer? Seems a bit far-fetched to me.

Anyway, regarding the attack vector where an attacker sets up lots and lots of payments channels and then tries to close them all at once ... you do know that the defenders can use RBF while the attacker can not? But all things considered, the security model is different, I agree. So is the security model for ""0-conf"" transactions by the way.

I don't think LN is a magical free lunch that solves all problems. I see it as an application layer that lives on top of Bitcoin, not as some sort of complete replacement for Bitcoin. It will be useful / necessary for certain kinds of applications, and for other applications it will not be.

There have been proposals on how to do this in the past, involving some algorithms to set the blocksize limit dynamically.

Here is an example of an investigation into one potential solution:

https://medium.com/@spair/an-adaptive-block-size-for-bitcoin-947fbc620c9b

Other coins like Monero handle their blocksize limits dynamically, and so far it has worked out for them.

There have been some criticisms of a simple adaptive approach, so perhaps it needs further study. 

Generally, there are differing viewpoints about whether abolishing the blocksize limit entirely would be a safe thing to do. Bitcoin Unlimited proposed ""Emergent Consensus"" as a way to navigate around the need for consensus on a fixed limit.

That approach might also work.",1525777659

"&gt; Just few millions users and bch already needs upgrade to 32mb. 

What?

The upgrade is to 32MB block LIMIT. It's not that the blocks will be 32MB in size after upgrade. You really need to understand why the LIMIT is there at the first palce. 

Clue - it is not to limit the tx capacity.

This upgrade is to show the users the path BCH is going  - on-chain scalling. Yes, 1GB blocks were already tested. https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7ax5ih/scaling_bitcoin_stanford_20171104_peter_rizun/",1525777558

"On Binance just look at the coins under the BTC pairs.  For me, I only consider investing in blue chip coins that I don’t mind sitting on for a while if I have to (while waiting for the Sat value to rise).  I don’t do any “real” technical analysis but when you look at the charts, it’s not that hard to see when a coin drops well below it’s moving average.  If I see that happen to the point it looks pretty juicy, I will typically move 25% of my BTC into it.  Then, if it drops even further I will move another 25% of my BTC into it.  Once it starts to come back I will sell off in the same amount of increments that I bought at (if I have 2 buys, I will sell in 2 increments on the upside instead of all at once).  That has a way of “locking in” profits and giving you more to work with if it heads back down (this happened yesterday with ETH and I was able to sell a stack at a relative high and then buy back the same amount again not even 20 minutes later, which I sold about 2 hours later for the same amount of profit again).  It’s not going to work as quickly as yesterday because sometimes it will take several days (maybe weeks) for it to come back up.  I wouldn’t feel comfortable doing this in a bear market, but right now it seems to be working pretty consistently.  ",1525777505

It was obviously a good place to look because it shows clearly that you are conjecturing about Bitcoin BTC fees.  Fees are lower now because usage is down and the only way to keep fees low and to screw the miners is to have fewer on chain transactions.

* 10-15 years from most of the BlockChain ecosystem being in place (starting to get next tier services on top of BlockChains, like banking/legal/asset management/etc)
* 15-20 years from maybe starting to get mass adoption. And that will come very gradually. Mass adoption means like 10% of services run on BlockChains.

"Good thing is you're scanning the merchants screen, what leaves your phone is a actual signed Bitcoin transaction.",1525776523
"The ""fractional teller banking"" problem is the more obvious one.  As I've written before:

The LN obviously isn't traditional fully-custodial ""banking"" (i.e. you put the coins in the bank's vault and only they hold the key). But *neither* is it the ""be your own bank"" of Bitcoin proper (the coins are in your own vault and only you hold the key). It's kind of a hybrid model where you and your bank / hub both lend funds to an entity (the channel) over which control is shared.  It's an interesting idea and it might even ""work,"" i.e. prove useful for certain niche use cases.  But... it has nothing to do with scaling Bitcoin.  Borrowing from a previous comment of mine:

A LN payment, which takes the form of updating the state of an open channel (and obviously occurs off-chain), is a necessarily imperfect substitute for a payment that takes the form of an actual, confirmed, on-chain transaction. How can you get defrauded in the latter case? If the person paying you manages to pull off a double spend. The good news is changing the public history of transactions in such a manner ""quickly becomes computationally impractical for an attacker... if honest nodes control a majority of CPU power."" How can you get defrauded in the former case? Well, the nature of the LN is such that if one party closes a channel in an old state in an attempt to steal from you, you must act to block the attempted theft by getting your own ""breach remedy transaction"" added to the blockchain within a defined ""dispute period."" That is a fundamentally different (and weaker) security model. It depends on a user's supposed ability to, when needed, get an on-chain transaction confirmed on the blockchain in a timely manner which is of course exactly what's compromised by imposing an arbitrary constraint on on-chain capacity. It's what I call [the LN's ""fractional-teller banking"" problem.](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4rdkiy/heres_how_bitcoins_lightning_network_could_fail/d50akqm/)  **The fundamental problem is that when you move transactions onto a ""second layer,"" you have, by definition, added a layer of risk. And that risk increases the more the main chain is artificially constrained -- the smaller your ""base,"" the more precarious the structures built on top of it.** 

But an even simpler way to see why the LN isn't some magical free lunch that eliminates the need for actual (i.e., on-chain) scaling is to consider some basic math. Payment channels require on-chain transactions for their creation. Well, at 3 tx/sec it would take the world's 7 billion people a minimum of about 76 years (!) to each make a single on-chain transaction.",1525776508

"**Heavy crude oil**

Heavy crude oil (or extra heavy crude oil) is highly-viscous oil that cannot easily flow to production wells under normal reservoir conditions.

It is referred to as ""heavy"" because its density or specific gravity is higher than that of light crude oil. Heavy crude oil has been defined as any liquid petroleum with an API gravity less than 20°. Physical properties that differ between heavy crude oils and lighter grades include higher viscosity and specific gravity, as well as heavier molecular composition.

The coffee shop (or at least their payment provider, which is TravelByBit) have at least 1 or a few channels opened with some nodes on the network. The customer also needs at least 1 opened channel with a node on the network.

Although it's not necessary for this particular coffee shop to have a channel with this particular customer, as the payment finds its way from node to node on the network to reach the intended recipient (with no risk of intermediate nodes stealing the in-transit money thanks to clever cryptographic tricks).

"That's actually something we saw happen during December's mempool spikes. Bitcoin nodes store the mempool in RAM, and when the mempool was as high as 200,000 unconfirmed transactions it was actually causing many nodes to crash. From Mike's response to a comment on his post:

&gt;So once we run out of capacity mempools would start bloating up. You’re right that this wouldn’t cause problems the very same day or anything. Node crashes and stalls (as they start heavily swapping and get really slow) would happen sporadically across the network as each one hits its own memory limits, which are unknowable.

"If you want to sell large quantities of bitcoin, you write a future contract. 

Let's say the bitcoin price at that time was 15.000 usd. You have to post 3.750 usd in margin. 

Some one who buys the future at the same time, will also have to post 3.750 usd in margin.

If bitcoin goes to 10.000 USD, the future writer receives 5.000 USD, the future buyer has to pay 5.000 usd \(note that during the drop he had to increase his margin to remain in the contract\). 

If you own a lot of bitcoin and you want to sell them, it's better to write a future contract since your price is stable \(eg farmers 2.000 years ago did this\).

"**Huffman coding**

In computer science and information theory, a Huffman code is a particular type of optimal prefix code that is commonly used for lossless data compression. The process of finding and/or using such a code proceeds by means of Huffman coding, an algorithm developed by David A. Huffman while he was a Sc.D. student at MIT, and published in the 1952 paper ""A Method for the Construction of Minimum-Redundancy Codes"".

The output from Huffman's algorithm can be viewed as a variable-length code table for encoding a source symbol (such as a character in a file). The algorithm derives this table from the estimated probability or frequency of occurrence (weight) for each possible value of the source symbol.

While not false, this is a detail that is rather irrelevant. Sure, people can make mistakes of any kind and stuff happens. Bitcoin is robust and the system will quickly self-correct.

The thing to realise is that at every single block we might get a chain-split for an abundance of reasons. Many of them simple based on mistakes.

Highlighting one mistake doesn't really make the situation anything special, we have chain splits often enough and we just call them orphans. These chain splits die out very quickly making them non-events.",1525774975

"&gt; You're missing the point. I'm saying that organic payment networks are not comparable to corporations.

i never made my original point to say they were akin to corporations, just noting what is popular or adopted now may not be tomorrow, even if the thing now is pretty big.

&gt; Not when the coin is not in equilibrium. More here.

and how is equilibrium obtained?  it seems the view is 'HODL to huge market cap' and i would argue it is participants that earn/spend and use the currency to transact vs. HODL speculators, and the market won't find that equilibrium as long as participants are a majority of the latter.

&gt; Lmao. Yes. Rick Falkvinge? Yes. Good grief, I cannot believe you're citing this scammer.

i don't know why you're claiming he is a scammer, but you did not speak to a single critique he offered up either.  are you expecting me to accept your assertion that the points he brings up are all unfounded, based on a simple ad hominem?

&gt; Are you saying that its network effect is proportional to its value? If so, I agree. The issue is that a centralized project like BCH is mutable and prone to censorship, therefore store of value is heavily diminished.

i can agree to this, i think you are exaggerating the risk of BCH though, and overvaluing your view of BTC in terms of people actually adopting a currency to use.

&gt; Because Bitcoin has not reached equilibrium. When the infrastructure is in place, it make no sense to use redundant, inferior projects. Money is a network good. Its value increases and is proportional to the strength of its network. More people and money coming on board to one system is better than two or more systems. Read that investor's take or look into metcalfe's law.

i don't disagree with this but you keep referring to present point in time network or adoption size vs. what it might be in 1/6/12 etc. months from now.  some people consider HODL adoption as well which i personally do not.  i'm not sure if there are good numbers to actually try and measure/estimate either of these things currently, i planned on looking for some more info in a bit after this response.

&gt; It is a scam coin. BCH has no viable long term road map. It's a pump and dump scheme that was (I guess cleverly) planned through a co-opting of the Bitcoin chain. Its roadmap leads to a brick wall and is a terrible design choice outside of its effects on centralization and inefficiency. It's ridiculed not just by Bitcoin but other cryptocurrencies as well. It's headed by total scammers, Roger, CSW, Falkvinge, Jihan, etc. Don't you ever wonder why these bad actors are at the forefront of marketing the project?

i disagree with all of this, that it necessarily is a road map that can't do anything but fail, and that these guys are all supposedly scammers.  roger doesn't need any more money - he is a passionate libertarian ideologue.  he wants a coin that delivers the utopian libertarian dream that a fully reserved currency promises.  you would do far better to attack him or the project or technical merit than him personally as i don't believe he's 'pumping and dumping a scam coin for money' - i think he's a True Believer in bitcoin, particularly the initial version as he understands it economically and technically.  i do agree he's done some objectively deceptive and bad actions in trying to wrestle the bitcoin name away from BTC.  however i think it weakens your argument when you reduce BCH to 'a scam' and roger to 'a scammer'.  i think you would have a hard time even finding someone else who is more of a real crypto enthusiast and true believer in how crypto (might) change the world.  even if you disagree with him or find him technically or economically in the extreme wrong place at the moment.

i don't follow CSW or jihan, i have not found a reason to consider falkvinge a 'total scammer' in any regard.

&gt; That's fine. But the truth is there's no demand for BCH beyond traders pumping and dumping it based on hype cycles.

i don't even know what present hype cycles you are proposing may be moving it this much - it has decent volume and is constantly bashed.  the hype and general sentiment is strongly negative to it, is it not?  i don't believe for one second it's simply 'a scam' but that is what you are claiming.  in the face of such headwinds i think it is hard for you to argue its pricing gains have been because of positive hype.

&gt; Again, BTC is processing more transactions, even at 1mb Segwit than BCH is. Most BCH blocks are relatively empty.

this should not be surprising given the latter is young and many people are not even aware that both exist.  it is not today's transactions but the ones 6 and 12 months out or the new people picking up a chain or both worth of bitcoin that are of interest.

&gt; You're mixing up your priorities if you think there's some sort of demand for BCH that is going to outpace LN adoption.

i very well may be, and i hold a comically small amount of both currencies for someone who first touched bitcoin anything in 2011.  nonetheless i'm unwilling to dismiss BCH outright and certainly wholly reject the claims that it is simply a scam.  we'll see how both technologies progress and what the market does over time.

&gt; It's not simple. Firstly, Bitcoin isn't/wasn't simple to begin with.

sure i agree, which is why it's even more of a pain as long as LN is more complicated to use.  we'll ignore the buying coffee, let's just say i wanted to get my mom on a bitcoin chain and send my dad some money on it, where they are both total newbies.  sure LTC or DOGE may be a better medium of exchange or have lower fees (LTC doesn't appear to?) but they want to be a part of the big well known bitcoin brand, although they see two and are not sure which one.  start to finish if you go through all the steps you know that BCH is going to be the simplest one and the on chain cost of it vs. off chain cost of lightning are going to be far less convincining than BCH's simplicity vs. (current) LN simplicity.

i'm sure i've already said above if LN was simple and it had no routing challenge that it would pluck off BCH no problem.  but LN is more complex today and i see no reason to dismiss the routing claims that have been brought up, and you know full well your ad hominem didn't make that argument.",1525774823

You're evidentally struggling with this one aren't you.  Remember we were discussing whether the network had broken or was working 'just fine' - I cited the time when the network was at stress and had AVERAGE $50 fees which is unacceptable.  The network was operating at unacceptable fee levels, ergo it was broken. So yes, I was talking about the average price at the moment of time in realtion to the point in discussion, obviously.  Re read this if you need to before you loop around on it again.  Whatever you say, the network was not working just fine then, nor in the weeks around that date.  This was not a momentary blip.

"Every 10 minutes on average some minor is rewarded with a coinbase transaction (currently 12.5 Bitcoin) plus transaction fees. The amount of money that is needed to buy and maintain computer equipment, plus the amount of money needed for electricity, will in the long run equal the reward except for a small profit that is kept near zero by minor competition.

So you can't really reduce the amount of money used on consuming electricity, because a rational minor would then find a way to use the extra funds to increase the chances of winning the next reward, which would then consume the same amount of energy that was originally saved.

"No need to resort to personal attacks. I have a very good understanding of Dash's system and far more intelligent than you give me credit for. The distinction you are making does not make sense to me.

Dash is splitting the block reward three ways, so yes, it's inflation in exactly the same way that Bitcoin's block reward is inflation. 

You seem to think it's different to inflation and that it's somehow a tax on miners, but I suspect that you only say this because the word 'tax' has negative connotations and you want to discredit Bitcoin competitors.

The economics of the system are the economics of the system regardless of the terminology you want to use. In Bitcoin you have developers relying on community handouts and full nodes providing hardware and bandwidth for free - yet somehow Dash has an unfair system because all network participants are paid for their contribution?

&gt;
&gt;If it's in crypto it's not in their possession. Stop being an obtuse cunt.

Go learn how a bank's business model works, kiddo.  Banks make money through lending at a higher rate than the interbank rate, in the case if the US the Fed Funds Rate, and they can borrow as much as they want at this rate as long as they are able to find enough debtors. That's just the commercial banking side, the other end is investment banking and brokering for private clients/financial institutions. Banking was one of the best performing sectors last year, as banks raked in record profits, which are still growing. 

Your argument that ""money in crypto = money not in banks therefore crypto is affecting the banks bottom line"" is something a five year old child would come up with, a five year old who doesn't understand how the banking industry actually works. There is never a shortage of money for a bank as they can just top off their reserves at the interbank rate. The only way to actually harm a banks bottom line would be if people stopped financing, which as crypto has shown us will never happen, lol how ironic.

"I agree on some points, but I think your position is a little narrow.

I hate banks as much as the next guy, but there are situations where we do still need them.

Here's a real-life example - I'm starting a business in China. For a foreigner to start/own a business here, we need to prove that the business will be funded through investment of foreign capital, because the government, understandably, wants to know that I'm going to help the economy grow, not simply reap the benefits of this huge market when a local citizen could be the beneficiary instead. 

I can't just turn up with an armful of USD and claim it's foreign investment - I could have just picked it up from a foreign exchange desk. It's pretty hard to prove that a wallet full of Bitcoin was purchased with foreign money.

The only way to do this is to have the money wired in to a trusted agency - a bank.
Aside from that, there are people who don't want to or cannot be their own bank. People who don't know much about computers, people with memory problems or dementia - if they rather pay a fee to have a bank take the risks of robbery, why shouldn't they?

"1. Send your first transaction with a low fee with the output being a merchant that will deliver goods/services on 0-conf basis.

2. Issue a second transaction to your own output(s) using the inputs from the first transaction, with a higher fee, to a part of the network that is not aware of the first transaction yet (or that is known to always favor higher fees transactions... it's part of the consensus that miners can make such choice without consequences or rather nothing prevents them from doing so). You could be in control of this part of the network too to make it even easier.

3. If this second transaction gets mined before the first one, the first one will never get mined by other miners as this would render their block invalid and rejected by other nodes that included a transaction spending the same inputs previously.

RBF, on Bitcoin's chain, makes this kind of activity easier to pull off but it is clearly displayed on the transaction itself and it has pretty much always been admitted that nobody should rely on 0-conf, with any kind of transaction (RBF or not). The recent push for 0-conf is only appearing because Bitcoin Cash has no counterpoint to Lightning Network ""instantaneous"" transactions otherwise, as I said, it is only a marketing ""feature"".

"Whoever thinks that mass adoption is close or just around the corner is utterly wrong. We’re not even close. Mass adoption would mean that everyday value transfers occur using crypto currency without even thinking about it, by a major part of the population. This requires shops to accept cryptocurrencies, business owners to easily do their accounting and taxes in crypto’s (and thus having regulation in place) and easy access for consumers to crypto. Currently the cryptocurrency is adopted by a small group of idealist and a large group of speculative investors. Both groups will benefit from further adoption, but the revolution that is required for mass adoption will only be really fueled by idealist. No great revolution has ever come from people who just want to be rich. No worries though, the fact that mass adoption is not even close, just means that there is all the more room to grow!

"It's just the way different systems were designed with different economics / incentives to prevent spam attacks. For example, Bitcoin and Ethereum transactions both charge fees for every transaction regardless of the amount. Even 0 Eth transactions cost gas, which accounts the computational cost of all the transactions that are merely invoking a function within a smart contract. Even if the transaction fails, if it required a large sum of gas / computational power it makes sense to cost way more than a transaction moving a huge amount of Eth that required minimal gas. Bitcoin's protocol follows similar logic, except you're paying in satoshis based on the byte size of the transaction rather than the actual amount moved. 
Side example of this in practice: A failed hack/exploit attempt on the P3d smart contract the other day, that even though 0 Eth was actually transferred the attacker wasted $60~ in gas on the attempted attack.  https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc27dffa105bfbd09c2f5705f6adf22248fa0fad4cc8dc8ab768f23b6f9484c4f",1525771904

Then they just tossed away all their progress down the drain by getting rid of their referral program, and shady shit with listing coins, and making no progress on anything (as far as I can see) like a dust-&gt;KCS or something (for rewards from holding KCS).

The ONLY thing I can possibly understand is their referral program had some legal issues. If there were no legal issues then they're actually braindead. Oh well. Ive since lost all faith in that exchange, and when I cashed out of KCS I noticed the spreads on almost all coins (except perhaps BTC and KCS) were atrocious aka not enough liquidity.

You're missing the point. I'm saying that organic payment networks are not comparable to corporations. 

&gt;so you disagree with that it was created with the intent to be used for as many transactions as possible including coffee and dinner? why? is this not the entire point of a competing fully reserved currency? i agree people aren't itching to do it that hold it, but that's because they aren't itching to do anything with it but have it make them rich - which is not what a store of value nor a currency actually does. merchants and consumers could both benefit by splitting saved cc transaction fees between eachother, so holders could be incented to use it to receive a discount. 

I'm saying that sound money has three (maybe four) characteristics that are essential. Means of exchange is only one aspect. 

&gt;and it was absolutely designed to be used for purchasing coffee and displacing fiat fractional reserve currency anywhere it can.

Not when the coin is not in equilibrium. More [here](https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/john-pfeffer/An+Investor%27s+Take+on+Cryptoassets+v6.pdf).

&gt;do you find all these critiques completely baseless?

&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFZOrtlQXWc https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8NH67_EfE

Lmao. Yes. Rick Falkvinge? Yes. Good grief, I cannot believe you're citing this scammer.

&gt;you seem to be claiming BTC need meet some arbitrary line until you allow it to be a currency or store of value. whereas i am saying, outright, it's a currency, and as such, it is also a store of value. it becomes a better one with greater adoption, but it's still one right now nonetheless.

Are you saying that its network effect is proportional to its value? If so, I agree. The issue is that a centralized project like BCH is mutable and prone to censorship, therefore store of value is heavily diminished.

&gt;speaking of circular arguments, you keep acting as if LN is great today. i point out it's complex and painful and i'm skeptical it's solved real routing problems at scale and then you say yeah but just you wait 6/12/60 months. then i say great well BCH is simple and cheap and working right now. then you tell me how great LN is today...

I'm not going to keep addressing this same point. LN is true scaling. BCH is a band-aid fix. **Bitcoin is processing far more transactions today (on chain) than BCH is. LN takes this to a whole other level.**. The ""issues"" your referencing are non-issues and have been refuted many times. You're just referencing baseless FUD.

&gt;inferior doesn't mean non-existent so why pretend they are interchangeable? 

Because Bitcoin has not reached equilibrium. When the infrastructure is in place, it make no sense to use redundant, inferior projects. Money is a network good. Its value increases and is proportional to the strength of its network. More people and money coming on board to one system is better than two or more systems. Read that investor's take or look into metcalfe's law.



the kuwaiti dinar is a strong currency, does that make USD not a store of value?

&gt;I quickly skimmed it and plan on more fully reading it. it still divided functions and made the store of value argument better than any other thing i have read although i think it glosses over how frictionless use is between banks and credit cards etc. vs. crypto. it also said to hold BCH as a hedge in case it ends up further along than BTC which is a scenario you appear to believe is 100% impossible. BCH meanwhile seems to be humming along ok, particularly given how many people claim it is an outright scam. i get jumped on already in r/bitcoin for basic economic chats or truths about dollars, that place has people voraciously attack guys like the one even selling anything at the farmers market for BTC or BCH. people there claim it is a literal scam coin and is on par with bitconnect. yet in the face of this it has been doing well, you must admit that even if you do think it's a futureless shitcoin with a long term value of 0.

It is a scam coin. BCH has no viable long term road map. It's a pump and dump scheme that was (I guess cleverly) planned through a co-opting of the Bitcoin chain. Its roadmap leads to a brick wall and is a terrible design choice outside of its effects on centralization and inefficiency. It's ridiculed not just by Bitcoin but other cryptocurrencies as well. It's headed by total scammers, Roger, CSW, Falkvinge, Jihan, etc. Don't you ever wonder why these bad actors are at the forefront of marketing the project?

&gt;i can agree there's probably a point where off chain scaling is needed - i'm just not convinced it is today and i'm unwilling to outright dismiss BCH when it seems to have more interest in getting a crypto currency actually adopted. yes LN is operational today - in a complex to use beta version release.

That's fine. But the truth is there's no demand for BCH beyond traders pumping and dumping it based on hype cycles. Again, BTC is processing more transactions, even at 1mb Segwit than BCH is. Most BCH blocks are relatively empty. You're mixing up your priorities if you think there's some sort of demand for BCH that is going to outpace LN adoption.

&gt;not quite; it is because BCH is simple and cheap for actual payments, while BTC or BTC+LN is more expensive or more complex. i'm just going with KISS

It's not simple. Firstly, Bitcoin isn't/wasn't simple to begin with. It's pretty complicated what's happening behind the scenes but UX is relatively straightforward at this point. Same goes for BTC+LN. The backend will seem complex to anyone who's not a dev but the concept is very straightforward and the implementation will be seamless for the end user. All technology works like this. Most people don't know the inner workings of their car, they just know how to press gas, break and steer. Same goes for LN.",1525769605

No, I'm saying that Segwit wasn't fully adopted and batching was not occurring on major exchanges. This was an issue of spam and lack of initiative on behalf of exchanges like Coinbase. Again, the spin here is unbelievable.

$55 was not the average. Sorry buddy. FUD.

We have scaled on-chain with bitcoin for the last 9 years and it has proven to work just fine, until the blocks got full. There is no disputing that this was poor capacity planning. It's possible that we can scale with a second layer but this should have been in place before a block cap was reached. Honestly, I hope one of the second solutions works, but I prefer to stick with the tried and tested.

Except that the network and market disagreed. So not sure what point you're trying to make. Traders and miners have not followed BCH, and AGAIN Bitcoin is processing far more transactions so your point is invalid. What your arguing is counterfactual anyway. Also, you *did* miss that Segwit increased the block size and Segwit TXs were never at capacity, so again, room for growth.

"&gt; I didn't say that. My point is that ""first mover"" in this space is not comparable to other spaces. This is a consensus based network with built-in economic incentives.

i don't feel that is the case at all.  bitcoin is the most well known brand and absolutely benefits from first mover status.  that is exactly the reason why many a person has bought and speculated in it despite that they could tell you extremely little about it.

&gt; Lol, it's not about tech superiority drawing people in. It's about BCH has an untenable roadmap, BTC doesn't and there's no demand for what BCH is offerring today. You're deluded if you think people are itching to use BCH to pay for coffee and dinner and such frivolous things.

so you disagree with that it was created with the intent to be used for as many transactions as possible including coffee and dinner?  why?  is this not the entire point of a competing fully reserved currency?  i agree people aren't itching to do it that hold it, but that's because they aren't itching to do anything with it but have it make them rich - which is not what a store of value nor a currency actually does.  merchants and consumers could both benefit by splitting saved cc transaction fees between eachother, so holders could be incented to use it to receive a discount.  and it was absolutely designed to be used for purchasing coffee and displacing fiat fractional reserve currency anywhere it can.

&gt; Lmao, you didn't say anything of substance here, so there's nothing I can respond to. This is pure FUD.

do you find all these critiques completely baseless?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFZOrtlQXWc
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug8NH67_EfE

&gt; I didn't bring up steam and either way Steam doesn't accept BCH either and you've listed 3 anecdotes. Are you for real? I want full data sets for both projects before I'll even engage on this point. Don't forget, segwit alone is still processing more TXs than BCH and higher value TXs. Do not ignore this brutal fact regarding the supposed superiority of BCH in merchant adoption. Of you don't have numbers that suggest otherwise, I'll have to assume that BTC is still much more popular for this purpose.

i never claimed BCH had greater merchant adoption at present.  my claim is today that it is a simpler and lower fee chain to adopt.  3 anecdotes of real companies dropping.  transactions are much below where they once were.  https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactions-btc-bch.html

&gt; Nonsensical, circular argument.

you seem to be claiming BTC need meet some arbitrary line until you allow it to be a currency or store of value.  whereas i am saying, outright, it's a currency, and as such, it is also a store of value.  it becomes a better one with greater adoption, but it's still one right now nonetheless.

&gt; BCH simply cannot compete on this level. It can't compete with LN either but that's a different story.

speaking of circular arguments, you keep acting as if LN is great today.  i point out it's complex and painful and i'm skeptical it's solved real routing problems at scale and then you say yeah but just you wait 6/12/60 months.  then i say great well BCH is simple and cheap and working right now.  then you tell me how great LN is today...

&gt; It doesn't have the property (or the property is weaker) because of metcalfe's law, contentious break with PoW consensus and much worse liquidity, volume, etc. My point is that it's inferior to Bitcoin in this regard and money, 

inferior doesn't mean non-existent so why pretend they are interchangeable?  the kuwaiti dinar is a strong currency, does that make USD not a store of value?  

&gt; This is simply not true on multiple fronts as I've already explained. I don't feel like rehashing the same point over and over.

you know that merchants have dropped BTC over fees and volatility so why do you keep claiming that hasn't happened?

&gt; Eh, did you read the whole thing? It doesn't actually bode very well for BCH or ETH or most other cryptos.

i quickly skimmed it and plan on more fully reading it.  it still divided functions and made the store of value argument better than any other thing i have read although i think it glosses over how frictionless use is between banks and credit cards etc. vs. crypto.  it also said to hold BCH as a hedge in case it ends up further along than BTC which is a scenario you appear to believe is 100% impossible.  BCH meanwhile seems to be humming along ok, particularly given how many people claim it is an outright scam.  i get jumped on already in r/bitcoin for basic economic chats or truths about dollars, that place has people voraciously attack guys like the one even selling anything at the farmers market for BTC or BCH.  people there claim it is a literal scam coin and is on par with bitconnect.  yet in the face of this it has been doing well, you must admit that even if you do think it's a futureless shitcoin with a long term value of 0.

&gt; It's a terrible idea to scale on chain because then every node is processing every transaction. This is terrible design and it puts small time nodes and miners out of the game. Scaling off-chain is a much better design, preserves the integrity of the network (decentralization) and is operational today.

i can agree there's probably a point where off chain scaling is needed - i'm just not convinced it is today and i'm unwilling to outright dismiss BCH when it seems to have more interest in getting a crypto currency actually adopted.  yes LN is operational today - in a complex to use beta version release.

&gt; ""guy thinks that BCH is going to out-compete BTC+LN because there's such high demand for merchant adoption in regards to on chain transactions. Lol!""

not quite; it is because BCH is simple and cheap for actual payments, while BTC or BTC+LN is more expensive or more complex.  i'm just going with KISS",1525768294

Segwit activated in late August 2017, when transaction fees were already more than $1 (not cheap by any means).

I don't think /u/mike_hearn's complaint was that it would be hard to do, but that it was an unnecessary solution to a problem that shouldn't exist in the first place.

Withdrawals from HitBTC and Poloniex are not working and neither is the Bytecoin webwallet, thus most investors are not actually able to sell their Bytecoins on Binance. The Bytecoin supply that's on Binance is very low and therefore it's easy to pump up the price, all the way up to 20x it's original price. This still caused a 100%+ surge on exchanges such as HitBTC and Poloniex, allowing the group to dump there.

The current Crypto top 30 is bursting with half-baked shit promises of moon shots. PPL see value in EVERY crap thrown at them, not even thinking if there is real world value behind the market the tech is aimed at. And even if the product gets used, it will be used only in a small part of that said industry, moving from here, the top 100 is a fiest of shit.....

&gt; The market for a stock is said to be liquid if the shares can be rapidly sold and the act of selling has little impact on the stock's price.

The crypto market has some liquidity, and some assets significantly more than others,  but more is always better for all assets, it reduces price spread and market volatility.

Another quote from the same article:

&gt; This is particularly true for companies that are non-liquid, or during after hours trading when fewer traders are active; at these times, it is better to place a limit order because the lower liquidity may lead to a price you would not be willing to pay.

"I think he was talking about Bitcoin Cash, not Litecoin, as LTC didn't ""fork off from the original Bitcoin genesis chain.""

Litecoin doesn't call itself Bitcoin, but it has been given a bunch of stupid analogies to try to legitimatize it. Like ""Bitcoin's little brother"" or ""The Silver to the Gold that is Bitcoin"" etc.

&gt;In fact, Litecoin enjoys a halo effect as a result and benefits from changes and implementations made on bitcoin that also work on litecoin. 

Because it was nothing but a copy/paste of the Bitcoin code with a few minor variable changes that could've been done to the code with find &amp; replace in notepad, and a new hashing algorithm.

&gt;Maybe you should take notes because Charlie Lee seems to be doing things the right way and the community embraces Litecoin as a result.

Because it's not a threat. Litecoin has the worst ownership distributions of the top 5 POW cryptos by market cap. (In order: BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC, DASH/XMR tied 5^th) LTC is actually more on par with something like Doge or VTC in distribution terms:

No. It's because of the monumental funding behind Blockstream/Core/ChainCode Labs. They told everyone that the corporations were behind all the proposals to increase the block size, when it was the corporations and banks backing 1MB4EVA^^TM

"&gt; It's a bad thing if regulators determine that LN nodes are money transmitters. Are you 100% certain that they won't? Sending other people's money through channels sounds awfully like money transmitting to me.

[Baseless and debunked assertion](https://twitter.com/valkenburgh/status/956538411468378112). There are no explicit or implicit agreements being made between nodes. There is only the unicast action of the sender.

&gt;I don't know about you but I've been using bitcoin for 5 years now.

Same.

&gt;It used to work just fine but then when the blocks got full it broke.

Spam, lack of batching and lack of Segwit adoption caused this. Things are not bad right now so I'm not sure why you're complaining.


&gt;Dispute this if you think $50 average fees are acceptable.

Acceptable *for what*? Also, you're using an extreme example.

&gt;So either we increase the block size,

Already did that and will ~~likely~~ definitely increase limit in future as well. 

&gt;create a second layer, 

Did that as well. Actually there are many layers in the works.

&gt;BTC is not materially increasing block size anytime soon and therefore has only the other two options remaining.

This again is just not true. Bitcoin already did increase the blocksize through Segwit. And, **again**, Segwit **alone** is processing more TXs than BCH is at 8mb (or 32mb, presumably).

&gt; I'm sure you're about to tell me what I'm missing. . .

Like I said, you're missing that BTC already got a block increase. Also, it will get limit increases in the future as well, as has been stated by virtually everyone working on BTC and LN.

&gt;(if it's that there are other scaling projects with cool names my insta-rebuttal to that is HOW LONG til they're proven to work?)

LN is already working, like I've already said. 

Just to summarize, Bitcoin scaling works like this. 1. Improve chain efficiency (Segwit [done] and schnorr [in the works]) 2. Add abstracted layers, including, but not limited to, payment channel networks 3. Increase blocksize limit to accommodate widespread adoption for layer-2 microtransactions

"&gt; Eth for instance has more decentralization

That’s not true. Due to size hardly anyone replays all transactions from genesisto verify the current state. This introduces trust: you have to trust a third party that they are not lying when they tell you the state of the ledger at some forward point in time.

With Bitcoin, anyone can verify the entire blockchain from genesis without needing excessive time or bandwidth. That is as a direct result of keeping a modest block size.

&gt; Trying to spin it as a feature

It is a fundamental trade-off. Higher transaction throughput increases bandwidth requirements and is therefore a centralization pressure.

(That’s assuming bandwidth is utilized with 100% efficiency, which it is not yet. Signature aggregation will increase transaction throughput another 20-25% without increasing bandwidth demands.)",1525765987

"Do you think that when Bitmain pre-mined the nascent Bcash fork, it was because it was profitable to do so? I recall they threw (tens of?) millions of dollars down that hole, when Bitcoin was far more profitable to mine. No, they created Bcash to have a SHA256 alternative to Segwit which was compatible with covert asicboost. Maybe their long-term gambit paid off after almost a year of fraudulent marketing, I don't know. But the point is that Bcash miners are mostly part of the Bitmain cartel, who has a proven track record of monopolistic behavior and stonewalling technical progress. Go look at the percentage of Bcash mining pools which are (directly or indirectly) controlled by Bitmain. If you're denying the reality of Bcash's centralization problem, you're only setting yourself up for pain later on. 

Questionable Bcash developers? Um, isn't it obvious? Did you completely forget about the whole ""Bitcoin Unlimited"" period where literally every single BU node crashed simultaneously, knocking their entire node network offline? Are you seriously telling yourself that when that happens on Bcash and the entire currency network goes offline for an undetermined period of time, that it won't destroy whatever shred of credibility they have left?

No, if you go back and read the press briefings, it was always clear that Bcash was not going to be ""competing for the longest chain and the title"". That's bullshit revisionist history. The Bcash founders were very clear about the fact that they would be creating a brand new token which would be a minority fork (aka altcoin), and ""the market"" confirmed this fact very quickly, so pretending ""the market is still deciding"" is a bit delusional. The fact that you have a bunch of high profile scammers conning people out of their money by claiming ""Bitcoin is dead and Bcash is Bitcoin now"" is intolerable. It's nothing less than unethical fraud, and you're sitting there trying to justify it as ""competition"". That's bullshit. You have your own token.

It has to be looked at differently as a result.

"Dethroning Ethereum

KM: A lot of people believe that NEM can dethrone Ethereum as the premiere smart contracts platform. What do you think about that? What are the obstacles to that happening, if any?

JM: I think that our technology has been fundamentally designed as more stable and secure. Literally every day, there are projects leaving Ethereum and coming to NEM. We've lost one project from NEM to Ethereum, and that was for financial reasons. I think that the data on the ground is showing that people who are building applications prefer NEM over Ethereum. Now we need to build on that momentum and scale it out.

If the growth patterns of Bitcoin, Ethereum and NEM continue with the same trajectory, what will happen is Ethereum will flip Bitcoin as the premier Blockchain. That's going to happen later this year, maybe next year, but it’s really just a matter of time.

    Ethereum is better than Bitcoin basically in every way you can imagine. It's faster, it has more utility, it’s just better. NEM turns out to be not in every way, but in a lot of important ways better than Ethereum. Sooner or later, people that are building will get this.

Ethereum's always had better marketing - they started off with marketing and then went to development. We started off with development, built a real product and then went to market. So we're still relatively unknown, but there's some technology coming out with Catapult that, for a lot of projects, will make NEM the only option.",1525765462

In terms of development decentralization, Ethereum is lacking. For the Bitcoin client ""Bitcoin Core""s releases, there must be consensus among all merge-request-approving developers to merge a branch. When a new version is released, you have signed gitian builds by dozens of developers, so you can verify rather than trust. Ethereum has still [yet to implement gitian builds](https://github.com/ethereumproject/go-ethereum/issues/338).

No. 
This ""therefor"" is a non sequitur in disguise. But even without going into rhetoric, what you are saying amounts to saying that the current banking industry does a better job at using energy for monetary operations than bitcoin would at scale ; this is saying that the amount of waste in the current industry is low enough to beat all optimizations brought by Bitcoin (by suppressing all intermediaries, by removing all the aspects of handling of physical currency, by stopping the system from being able to create debt and depression). 

This extraordinary claim (that current banking system is better than a full scale bitcoin) will certainly need way more than a ""therefor"" to stand. I'd be interested to see a well formed argument here.

"&gt; its mining hashpower is highly centralized

How can it possibly be the case that the hash power of Bitcoin Cash is more centralized than Bitcoin? It is literally exactly the same miners(!) that allocate hash power based on price. If this was not the case there would not be close to a 1:1 relationship to the hash rate and price ratio between the two.

Also, miner centralization is obviously less of an issue as long as there is no way to prohibit new miners from competing. 

&gt; developer qualifications are very questionable

Do you have anything to back up this value judgement with? I would say that with stakes this high it would be appropriate to stay away from touchy feely and stick to facts. If the qualifications were so questionable they would surely have made some grave mistakes by now?  

&gt; it's being marketed in extremely fraudulent ways

How so? From the very get go it was always going to be multiple chains competing for the longest chain and the title. This is just a competing chain doing exactly that. Sharing the same history, same code and same people. _Minor_ tweaks set them apart, but the tweaks are political in nature, which is why its healthy for the market to decide which one to follow.

Transaction replacement does not constitute a double-spend attempt. At least not in the nefarious meaning.

RBF doesn't cripple instant transactions. On a chain which doesn't suffer from block space pressure, BIP125 RBF poses no additional risk to 0-conf. In fact, RBF could enable BCH to implement certain types of smart contracts that Satoshi designed into the system but require transaction replacement.

But only if the BCH userbase is willing to accept that RBF is not the monster it's been made out to be.

I see. Yeah well there's certainly a lot riding on LN but obviously your point about BTC not working without it is blatantly false. It's been working fine without LN all this time and LN is really only one aspect of scaling. Lots of other projects are in the works.

&gt;Regular non-mining nodes don't contribute to decentralization

Yes they do. If you dont run your own full node, the you are not a peer in the network, you are someone's client. Ordinary users running their own nodes to verify the transactions and thus enforce the rules, is what prevents a cabal of miners and exchanges from changing the consensus rules, like they tried with Segwit2x.

If you think a small group of ""trusted"" nodes operated by miners and exchanges is good enough, then you dont need mining because you just reinvented Ripple's trusted node model.",1525763540
