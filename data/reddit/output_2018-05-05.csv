Lmao I've been in the community over 3 years and everything I've spent 100s or 1000s of hours researching and understanding BITCOIN through out Theese Years..

I expect most of the crypto trader who owns BTC to have some ETH, and it is so much faster.

My opinion is from a common investor\-sense of things; in knowing investors are driven by fear and greed, with the two greatest factors driving those are news and sentiment. I think we're talking about apples and oranges here. Insofar as fake trades go  \-Tell that to those buying BTC on an exchange that accepts USD deposits and withdrawals, move it over to another exchange that doesn't, buying an alt/BTC pair, trading it, making profit, turning it into BTC, moving it back over to the first exchange, selling it for USD and then withdrawing that to a bank. The aforementioned may someday be illegal but for now, none of it looks fake to me. Respectfully ",1525589576
"&gt; while at the same time ignoring similar problems the core team has had in it's history.

LOL!! In 2013 bcash supporter Gavin Anderson was lead developer on Bitcoin.  The Core team didn't take over the project until well after a year.  

&gt;As for scaling. There is all this. Developers do not work in a vacuum and given the shared tech of both chains scaling tech is being developed for both at the same time. I am sure you are aware of Graphene, Xtreme Xthin and Compact blocks. 

Seriously?  Graphene?  You realize that the Core team actually already did a lot of work on block propagation and the projects you are referring too offer like a few % improvement at the cost of significant CPU usage and restrictions on the protocol.  

How are you going to have a 2nd layer solution without a malleability fix.    

Colored coins isn't good for fungibility and has nothing to do with scaling Bitcoin.

I'll read over your malleability fix and scaling roadmap a bit later.  It's late here and I need more sleep.  

Your only mining nodes matter is bull shit.  There are limitations on ports there are security concerns.  If you were operating in good faith you'd say ""Only mining pool's nodes matter"" because miners almost exclusively mine with a pool.  When you increase the barrier to entry to running a mining pool you centralize the coin.  Small pools can't exist without sufficient income which they would never get without ASICBoost.  When the government shuts down a pool that would be a huge deal that would no longer be able to recover from.  Gone will be the days that we can spin up a new pool over TOR and carry on.  In otherwords Bitcoin will no longer be nation state hard.  

PoS doesn't work.  Even bringing this up in the discussion demonstrates you don't even understand the basic game theory equation that makes PoW work.  

I gave you the link.  

He said ""it would be great if we had banks and countries (governments) running Bitcoin.""

He then goes on to say it would subsidize Money for the people.  

The only way that would happen is if they were running a bitcoin node... which only makes sense in Bitcoin Casher's minds if they are running a mining pool .. which means they are in sole control of the protocol and literally RUN(control) Bitcoin.  Not hard to understand what was said there.

Said chart gets a bunch of likes, so now there‚Äôs this false consensus of what‚Äôs going to happen. Then shit hits the fan and people are mad, so ‚ÄúTA is a bunch of bullshit‚Äù.  

Not that I‚Äôm by any means great since I‚Äôve been doing this for a limited amount of time, but my goal is to always find the bull and bear possibilities and be agnostic about it. I‚Äôll watch for a few days and see which of these scenarios seems most plausible and set entry/exit points. If I miss, I move on and try to forget about it.

"Neither of the above... both imply putting money in to something that is not money in order to later increase our amount of money (either by selling it again or getting something like dividends).

My problem with this is that bitcoin is my *preferred* money.

Note that I don't disagree it's possible to invest/speculate with money.  Someone buying UK pounds in the hope that they appreciate in value compared to US Dollars only to sell them again later for US Dollars is indeed treating UK pounds as an asset rather than a currency.  However, if your personal preferred currency is UK pounds, then the scenario just doesn't make sense.  It's certainly a financial strategy you could employ, but it'd be missing the end goal of finally selling the US dollars for even more UK pounds than you originally started with.

As bitcoin is my preferred currency, and I am not interested in trying to profit from trading (regardless of how you name it), the very concept of calling my use of bitcoin ""investment"" or ""speculation"" are both non-sensical statements.",1525589302

"It's all a result of a years-long campaign against anyone or anything that goes against the Core narrative. This has a trickle down effect. Read this:

&gt; Lightning, Payment Channels, Sidechains are at least interesting and address ""Scaling""

Professor Stolfi decribed the Lightning Network quite well:

&gt; ""The LN is a project to reach Mars in a balloon made of concrete. All that it needs to work is a gas that is much lighter than vacuum."" [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7l8qt9/conversation_with_the_ln_developer_about_the/drkgks4/)

And he's right. The Lightning Network does not address scaling, because it does not work. They have been saying it will be ready soon for years. And at any rate, it still wouldn't work without several hundred megabyte sized blocks. The refusal to increase the blocksize was explained in great detail here by the aforementioned professor.

&gt; Let's face it, we don't need 32MB blocks if no one is using it.

This is a myth. The 1mb blocksize that was originally placed on bitcoin was over 100X more than was needed. When Bitcoin was first created, the blocksize was actually 32 mbs, which was thousands of times bigger than needed. The blocks are not only not supposed to be full, they are not supposed to be any where near full. This is how Bitcoin was designed. Here, read this thread. It goes over all of this:

Thats not really expensive in the context of $18mi being mined everyday, for example. This cost is to fill the block by yourself, it's not even counting with regular transactions.

While it is possible to attack the network by spending money this way, they are incentivized by their intrinsic greed to just make money by being honest actors instead. This is why no 51&amp;#37; attack is attempted on BCH, because mining BCH in good faith is paying the bills, and frankly gives SHA256 miners a strong backup option for BTC if anything.

The people building BCH decided they didn‚Äôt want to go along with the changes the rest of the BTC community were accepting, and so they took action to make what they did support a reality. BCH more closely fits their definition of what makes bitcoin, bitcoin, including the needed adjustments to realize that vision in an uncertain, hostile mining environment.

The ""Cash"" part of Bitcoin Cash does obviously emphasize the main purpose for bitcoin's existence, and I don't think it detracts. 

There just happens to be a bunch of folks (and also a full time team of astroturfers and a useful minion-like mob) who spend loads of time and energy denying that it is legitimate at all (""bcash"", ""btrash"", ""shitcoin"", ""scam"", etc.). And, of course, there is the issue of the other forum (r / bitcoin) that claims to be ""heavily moderated"" which is spin-speak for censored, and alternately allows/disallows mention or discussion of ""altcoins"" (bcash, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Nano, etc.) based on the moderators' whims.",1525585916

On 'upgrade', I don't think that there is any material confusion really, I see some likely trolls pretending to be confused every so often, but no real confusion (If there was I'm not sure the price would be rallying).  Secondly, a hardfork isn't a bad thing, it allows a) democratically controlled changes, b) stability for the coin if a) isn't adhered to or in the unlikely event of something going wrong.  So my view is we should be very comfortable with a hard fork.

No of course not. The whole point of not having huge blocks is so you don't need a rack of servers. Its having the option to verify your own transactions if you want to. If nobody has the option to verify their transactions and must rely on a third party then the network is no longer trustless is it? Nodes is what give users power and a say in how the network evolves. If only miners run nodes then they would 100% own Bitcoin. They can make any changes at any times whether users like it or not.

So I don't find it strange either, but very telling - it looked like disrespect and spite.  I believe Johnny was tired of Satoshi's name and vision constantly being used to argue against what Core was doing.  So he erased Satoshi from his mind and consideration.  ",1525581681
"&gt;Nobody cares about the node owners.

I completely understand your rage against high fees but centralized nodes are much worse for the users. I wish everyone could be happy, but resources arent infinite.

Right now the best outcome possible was the btc x bch fork so everyone could choose its own way. BCH broke mining difficulty rules to survive, so I don't think its fair to consider it the original bitcoin. It should keep its ""low fees no matter what"" ethos and follow its way, maybe it have good outcome.

All you have to do is read the whitepaper and its clear where BTC has strayed from what was initially envisioned. Once BTC adopted segwit and other ""off-chain"" centralization loopholes like those it became solely a money grab. Bitcoin cash scales the blocks as needed and it has an average tx fee of $.04, it doesnt have to let someone else invent some workaround that then can be scaled. Bitcoin cash is about being a usable adoptable miniscule fee p2p cash system, is that not what Bitcoin was supposed to be?? when did it change? If btc were 100k, could you imagine the cost of sending $20 p2p? that makes it unusable for anyone who doesnt have extreme wealth. why should anyone have to pay $30 for their transaction to be confirmed within 24 hours.

"crypto-to-crypto is no different than any other trade. You need to take the value of the crypto sold at the time of the sale and deduct your cost base average. That's your profit and the taxable amount. 

Look at it this way. Suppose you buy $1000 worth of crypto and you make a million trades during the day (crypto-to-crypto, to USD to whatever) and at the end of the day, you have $2000 worth if you were to sell everything. Your taxes would be whatever your rate is in your country for capital gains on $1000. Take someone else who buys one coin for $1000 and sells for $2000. They too pay capital gains taxes on $1000. A gain is a gain is a gain. The number of transactions doesn't matter. 

Where some people get screwed over is on trades at a loss and not being able to deduct that from their gains for tax purposes. So you might owe a little more this year. But it'll even out next year. If you day trade, shouldn't matter at all actually.

The scenario you talk about where you trade, HODL and then it tanks is the one I mentioned above. You don't actually pay more taxes for your coins tanking. If you sell, you can offset the losses (usually the next year), but it all evens out. If you keep trading until it comes back up, then it all zeros out anyways.",1525581260

I doubt anyone would even care anymore if bcash didn't turn into a meme to piss off Roger.

As far as bcash taking off organically is concerned, that's not a hypothetical, it was suggested since day one and basically everyone agreed that Bitcoin Cash was a better name. Either you recently created a new throwaway account, or more likely, you weren't here when this originally happened.

(b)  So you believe that Roger and Jihan have more BTC then anybody else? How much BTC do you think they still have and when will they run out and how much BTC do they spend each day?

(c) Jihan also holds BTC, if he dumps BTC this would be the exact same thing. If Jihan wants BCH to succeed and BTC to die why does he not just stop mining on the BTC chain and sell all his BTC for BCH?

that is alot smaller than an increase to 2 mbs especially at adoption percentage in the low thirties. 1.2mb blocks are still low. Segwit is a great supplement but an increase in block size to 2mb is needed to meet the demand of last december 2017. If you don't think bitcoin is going to the moon anytime then it makes sense not to increase the block size. However i think there will be more bitcoin hype and fomo and it only makes sense to increase the blocksize  to 2 mb to prepare for it. Let's try to get off this war with bch and be rational. just because roger ver is irresponsibly increasing blocksize of bch doesn't mean the idea has no merit. we need to step away from all the naritives and be resonable. ,1525581020

The average person doesn't want to run a full node period and never will for the same reason the average person doesn't want to and won't run their own email server.

It would be absolutely nuts if the actually useful bitcoin continued to go down in price, it isn't surprising in the slightest it raised %-wise against lightning net.

"For the sake of clarity, [bitcoin clashic is a real thing](http://bitcoinclashic.org/).. though it seems to be a parody. I thought you were talking about bitcoin classic. But perhaps not. I assume you are trying to infer that because a hardfork was done to correct problem issues that the project was somehow a failure [while at the same time ignoring similar problems the core team has had in it's history.](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=152030.0) These projects are made by people. Often different teams of people. Human error is universal among us. The issue is not so much that mistakes happen, as they are inevitable, but how the teams deal with these issues as they arise. 
I would even argue that BCH is in a better position to handle them as ""Hard Fork"" is not a dirty word here. 

As for scaling. [There is all this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7y0qus/are_there_any_roadmaplistplan_for_bitcoin_cash/) Developers do not work in a vacuum and given the shared tech of both chains scaling tech is being developed for both at the same time. I am sure you are aware of Graphene, Xtreme Xthin and Compact blocks. Seeing how opposed to the above the core team has been on reddit it seems more likely that those techs will be more welcome on the BCH chain. Not to mention how re-introducting OP_RETURN will free up the space for second layer solutions. Colored coins has a lot of potential as well. You may argue that those things are not good by your personal standards but they are on the roadmap. More importantly in my opinion is that with the 32mb increase we are in a position to explore and test other scaling methods for years to come without having to invest all are time and effort into one technology (lightning). 
If for some unforeseen reason lightning fails, what will happen to BTC?

As for your full node problem. Only mining nodes matter. Mining nodes will forever be run by people who have the money to invest in the hardware. Even if there were no asics and there was a hardfork to change the algo to be limited to GPUs or CPUs.[ It is obvious what would happen.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhLVELIXjs0) Someone with a lot of money and connections to chip makers would buy vast amounts and concentrate it in places with cheap power. POS has similar problems. So what is your solution?

In software engineering, a project fork happens when developers take a copy of source code from one software package and start independent development on it, creating a distinct and separate piece of software. The term often implies not merely a development branch, but also a split in the developer community, a form of schism.

Free and open-source software is that which, by definition, may be forked from the original development team without prior permission, without violating copyright law. However, licensed forks of proprietary software (e.g.

"&gt;256mb &gt; Empty blocks &gt; Cheap to spam again &gt; Full Blocks &gt; Fee market happening again. Collateral damage: Nodes are now commercial and enterprise level stuff.

Ugh get a better computer and/or better internet if you think 256mb blocks would prohibit users from running their own node. The average consumer laptop with a decent internet connection could handle 256 MB blocks.

Also, most people don't want to and don't need to run an always on server (full-node) just to use Bitcoin. Satoshi was smarter than the current crop of Core devs and used the Merkle tree data structure to facilitate trustless verification that transactions are included in a block (SPV).

&gt;This will happen faster than you think. Fees act as a spam filter. Spam leads to a bloated network that only can be maintained by centralized servers.

Why did it take Bitcoin 8 years just to fill 1MB blocks but BCH is going to instantly have 256mb worth of transaction demand? This is bullish for BCH if true, but I'm skeptical.",1525577278

"I wouldn't want anyone tying the amount of crypto I own to my name, either. I consider the ideal identity verification and unification platform to utilize an opt\-in model, rather than an opt\-out. As in, you can apply it to whichever apps/platforms/sites you'd like, and keep other ones identity\-segregated. 

You raise a good point, though, that the first to attempt this will have to parse out, which is: how much data is owned by the platform, and how much by the user? The recently released GDPR may make that decision for any platform dev, but the philosophical point remains. I know in the case of Civic, information such as fingerprint and facial information is stored on the device itself. 

In short, I think you'd be able to keep plenty of aspects of your online identity separate from your real one. But the point of these platforms will be to verify specific aspects of your identity. Maybe, for example, you can be able to ID\-verify a transaction without actually transmitting any personal information. That is to say, your ETH wallet will ping your phone asking you to provide a fingerprint affirming you mean to send ETH to another wallet. You provide your fingerprint and the transaction is approved, but no real data about yourself is transmitted anywhere. Pretty cool, huh? Let's hope someone is able to manage that. ",1525575564

The larger the block size, the more people can use the chain for transactions, including ingenious things like running on-chain social networks and such.

People on this sub are reading Whitepaper, looking at the new apps built in BCH (memo, blockpress, etc), looking at OP_CODES that will give BCH smart contracts functionalities and most importantly, big blocks that allows cheap microtransactions which opens up new merchant adoption for day-to-day use.

All you BTC folks have are 'over 9000' memes, useless lightening 2nd layer that don't even use BTC blockchain, segwit crap and price memes. Keep sticking to your memes, let us focus on building smart contracts, microtransactions, merchant adoption and future colored coins.

Now imagine BCH starting at $300 with fungibility, future colored coins, smart contracts OP codes and future privacy functions, BCH will dominate and become number 1 compared to ethereum. It's like btc+monero+ethereum combined into one. BCH has the exact ledger and blockchain up until the fork, but now with more capabilities and functionalities than the old BTC. 

All BTC has is the name of the first crypto, expensive fees when blocks are full when everyone wants to use it. Best case to have microtransactions on BTC is not too use it so blocks are not full and free are cheap? You guys actually ask people to stop using BTC instead of encouraging adoption?

"&gt; changes to the protocol called Lightning Network...

This is something that gets repeated a lot but there are no changes to Bitcoin to work with Lightning network. This is FUD. The only change to Bitcoin has been the addition of SegWit which is still compatible with older constraints on blocks. That's not to say that SegWit wasn't a change, it was, but in a clever way that makes SegWit blocks look like and validate as older blocks did.

The fact of the matter is that there is absolutely zero code related to the Lightning network added to Bitcoin. Lightning doesn't depend on a specific cryptocurrency and it works just as well with Litecoin for instance. The only reason why SegWit is often described as required for Lightning Network is because SegWit also fixed transaction malleability. LN is still totally possible even without fixing transaction malleability, the problem is that an attacker can screw with your transactions in such a way as to lock up your funds until your channel expires and sends the coins back to you. Even without totally fixing transaction malleability Bitcoin Cash could still use Lightning network to transfer coins offchain.",1525575224

&gt; The issue is that the signatures themselves are removed from the blockchain. [...] The signatures are ""serialized"" onto the blockchain with a hash, but the signatures themselves are gone. A hash relating to signatures is a far different thing than the signatures themselves. This is a much weaker security model.

Witness data has always been condensed as part of a hash in bitcoin, and continues to be with BCH. In BCH and pre-Segwit BTC (or current non-Segwit blocks), the transactions, including their witness data are only represented in the chained data by the merkle root hash they form.  Critically, that witness commitment becomes embedded in the block's overall transaction merkle root, in a different - but no less secure - way as witness data for non-Segwit transactions. Not only is the witness data still included (as much as it ever was), _it's in the same place in the block!_

Segwit does not even directly change how the transactions themselves are hashed. Instead, special meaning is given to an otherwise legal anyone-can-spend script. Under the updated consensus rules, that witness script informs anyone processing a Segwit transaction that they should consult the witness data and validate against the additional script or public keys it contains. The only change Segwit makes to how a block's merkle root is calculated is indirect - adding the requirement that the coinbase data include the witness commitment.",1525574519

"Elastos DApps all run in a C virtual machine which means these DApps can be deployed and run on any device as the kernel in most devices is also written in C. Everything runs in a sandbox and applications don`t have direct access to the internet so DDOS &amp; man in the middle attacks are impossible. Elastos provides SDK for developers so they can use most common programming languages, so makes it lot easier for them (you have to learn Solidity if you want to use ETH for example). Scalability is basically infinite due to mainchain/sidechain structure. You can publish limited amounts of digital assets because Elastos gives them ID, this allows new kind of business opportunities. Elastos can be an independent OS or it can run on top of existing OS (windows,anroid,iOS..). Main chain is merge mined with BTC (POW) and sidechains can use what ever consensus mechanism needed. Its possible for existing projects to become a sidechain of Elastos (NEO,ETH..). Many industries could benefit of extra security what Elastos can provide (airline industry, self driving cars, space tech, iOT..). Also the first dapps building on top of Elastos are existing big companies and Elastos has been meeting those really big names and I see this being very important when we move from speculation to mass adoption. Personally I believe that we are going towards mass adoption right now and speculative projects will die.

"This is from their GitHub, which helps explain how they measure time:

&gt; It's possible for a centralized database to process 710,000 transactions per second on a standard gigabit network if the transactions are, on average, no more than 178 bytes. A centralized database can also replicate itself and maintain high availability without significantly compromising that transaction rate using the distributed system technique known as Optimistic Concurrency Control [H.T.Kung, J.T.Robinson (1981)]. At Solana, we're demonstrating that these same theoretical limits apply just as well to blockchain on an adversarial network. The key ingredient? Finding a way to share time when nodes can't trust one-another. Once nodes can trust time, suddenly ~40 years of distributed systems research becomes applicable to blockchain! Furthermore, and much to our surprise, it can implemented using a mechanism that has existed in Bitcoin since day one. **The Bitcoin feature is called nLocktime and it can be used to postdate transactions using block height instead of a timestamp. As a Bitcoin client, you'd use block height instead of a timestamp if you don't trust the network. Block height turns out to be an instance of what's being called a Verifiable Delay Function in cryptography circles. It's a cryptographically secure way to say time has passed. In Solana, we use a far more granular verifiable delay function, a SHA 256 hash chain, to checkpoint the ledger and coordinate consensus.** With it, we implement Optimistic Concurrency Control and are now well in route towards that theoretical limit of 710,000 transactions per second.",1525571537

"Privacy is easier to manage on bitcoin than on other platforms because the blocks doesn't know your name. If you give a new address to everyone you receive money from, it's basically impossible for anyone who sends you money to find out how much you have, they can only know how much they've sent you.

The difficult things are address reuse and address consolidation. If you reuse one address for lots of transactions, anyone who sends you money at that address or receives money from that address can find out how much you have. And, if you consolidate your bitcoins by simply sending everything in all your addresses a new address, anyone who has one of your old addresses can follow the money and find out how much you have in your new one.

Both of these problems have solutions: don't reuse addresses, and if/when you consolidate, anonymize it first and consolidate it into three or four addresses instead of just one. You can anonymize your bitcoins in several ways, one of which is to turn it into Monero briefly and then change it back into bitcoins over the course of a few hours, sending it into three or four bitcoin addresses. Do that and you've anonymized your finances once again.",1525571426

    I hope you are doing well. I finally got all the lawyers happy enough
    to release BitCoinJ under the Google name using the Apache 2 license:
 
    It's incomplete - notably it doesn't properly handle block chain
    splits yet - but the rest is coming. I put a lot of work into
    documentation and comments so hopefully it'll open up BitCoin to a new
    audience who weren't able to understand/build the current code. Over
    the next month or two I'll be finishing off some of the bigger missing
    pieces for a full client-mode implementation.
 
 
That's great news!  Much complexity can be left behind in a clean rewrite with only client requirements, and it opens it to Java developers too.
 
    I know you are busy right now but I'm hoping you can find time to
    answer a few questions I had.
 
 
I'm happy to answer any questions.
 
    As part of doing full SPV I'm thinking of adding a getmerklebranch
    message to the protocol. This would return a set of {blockhash,
    branch} pairs
 
 
That's a CMerkleTx
 
    given tx hashes, so allowing verification of a broadcast
    transaction before it was incorporated into a block without storing
    the full chain. Does that approach sound good to you?
 
 
I don't understand.  A merkle branch links a tx back to a block, which only has significance if the block exhibits proof-of-work.  Linking back to an as-yet unsolved block proves nothing.
 
Network nodes are able to verify 0-conf txes because they have the complete tx index, so they can:
1) verify signatures against dependencies.
2) say that they haven't seen another spend yet, because they know about every tx in existence.
 
Are you talking about CMerkleTxes for the tx's dependencies?  That would get part 1), but not part 2).
 
If you don't know about all txes in existence, I don't know how to do 2).  You could only rely on trusting other nodes for that.  That trust can be distributed over multiple nodes.  Nodes only relay transactions they accept as valid.  If you receive inv messages for a tx from all the nodes you're connected to, they're attesting that it's valid and the first spend they saw.
 
    Also, I've been thinking of exploring different transaction types
    lately, eg by removing the IsStandard() checks for the testnet.
 
 
Very good idea.  That should definitely be allowed on -testnet.
 
    It's
    clear you put a lot of thought into transactions beyond simply moving
    coins around up front, but unfortunately none of it was in the paper
    or documented in the code. Escrow, multi-pay and so on are all
    interesting but I was wondering if you could compile a list of ideas
    for things we can do with the scripting language at some point.
 
    Finally, the code that allows for transaction replacement has been
    disabled but the comment doesn't say why. Is this just to reduce the
    attack surface/complexity or is there a deeper reason?
 
 
Just to reduce surface area.  It wouldn't help with increasing tx fee. A tx starts being valid at nLockTime.  It wouldn't work to have a tx that stops being valid at a certain time; once a tx ever becomes valid, it must stay valid permanently.
 
See these threads:
http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=1786.msg22119#msg22119
http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=2181.msg28729#msg28729
 
    I haven't fully
    understood why sequence numbers are a property of the tx inputs rather
    than the tx itself.
 
 
It's for contracts.  An unrecorded open transaction can keep being replaced until nLockTime.  It may contain payments by multiple parties.  Each input owner signs their input.  For a new version to be written, each must sign a higher sequence number (see IsNewerThan).  By signing, an input owner says ""I agree to put my money in, if everyone puts their money in and the outputs are this.""  There are other options in SignatureHash such as SIGHASH_SINGLE which means ""I agree, as long as this one output (i.e. mine) is what I want, I don't care what you do with the other outputs."".  If that's written with a high nSequenceNumber, the party can bow out of the negotiation except for that one stipulation, or sign SIGHASH_NONE and bow out completely.
 
The parties could create a pre-agreed default option by creating a higher nSequenceNumber tx using OP_CHECKMULTISIG that requires a subset of parties to sign to complete the signature.  The parties hold this tx in reserve and if need be, pass it around until it has enough signatures.
 
One use of nLockTime is high frequency trades between a set of parties.  They can keep updating a tx by unanimous agreement.  The party giving money would be the first to sign the next version.  If one party stops agreeing to changes, then the last state will be recorded at nLockTime.  If desired, a default transaction can be prepared after each version so n-1 parties can push an unresponsive party out.  **Intermediate transactions do not need to be broadcast.  Only the final outcome gets recorded by the network.  Just before nLockTime, the parties and a few witness nodes broadcast the highest sequence tx they saw.**

I'm no academic but seriously - you 'refute' someone else's paper you don't presume to update it because one current implementation of 'bitcoin' makes the whitepaper look 'outdated'. If anyone or anything 'owns' the bitcoin name it should be Satoshi/his whitepaper - not the current BTC implementation which is no longer SATOSHI'S bitcoin because of ALL the code changes since SN disappeared.

SN never trademarked the name and the code base he provided has always been called bitcoin and been added to by others.  An 'evidenitary' chain of ownership exists so to speak - so that one could argue ownership of a 'work of art' for BTC. But that's not really what Bitcoin is or ever was. Even those claiming the bitcoin name can hardly argue that point - at least not likely to do so in any court case.",1525570999

"Not a bad end goal, but the article reflects some core misunderstandings of finance and, for lack of a better term, the traditional fintech space.

&gt;SEC is overall friendly to crypto and wants the community to self regulate first.

I think a lot of people would be surprised, but most financial regulations are quite fair. It's the barrier to entry to participate as some form of financial services provider that are cumbersome. However, the SEC is going to try to bring crypto ""up-to-standard"" as most of the crypto markets don't even come close.

&gt;Liquidity is one of the biggest issues for crypto and why it‚Äôs so volatile. Lack of liquidity pools are the biggest problem here. Lack of liquidity means easily manipulated order books and more volatility. Liquidity is pooled in individual order books and not shared across exchanges.

Primary cryptos like BTC and ETH are about as volatile and liquid as some stocks. Solving the ""liquidity problem"" basically means spendable currency is the desired end-goal.

Here's the kicker, increasing liquidity even to the levels that the USD has (probably the most liquid financial instrument in the world) will not adequately reduce price volatility. There are other mechanisms that determine price stability. These are human components that are 100% centralized. I realize not everyone in the crypto community care about centralization vs. decentralization debate to the same degree, but to achieve price stability similar to primary fiats, you'd need a centralized governing body.

&gt;DEXs will hopefully change all of that.

I work with high speed tech providers. DEX's are decades away from being capable of replacing centrealized exchanges. Both Binance and Coinbase are probably 10 years behind real exchange technology.

Usually, some fellow has a ""buyer"" offering to buy an insane quantity of BTC (think 200K+) and willing to pay a finder's fee. Then somehow the entire deal implodes before it happens. 

&gt;Crypto needs a robust and healthy derivatives market

Obviously. Financial outsiders seem to have a somewhat common belief that derivatives and every financial swap instrument was devised to leverage and get investor money. Not saying that isn't entire true, but I think many would be surprised that market stability is heavily related to these types of contracts.

&gt;Big institutional money hasn‚Äôt entered the space yet, despite what Novogratz said. First, lack of custodial services to help them facilitate/purchase/store crypto. Second, it‚Äôs way too volatile for them.

True, but not the right reasons. Like I said, BTC and ETH are about as volatile and liquid as some stocks and banks certainly hold them.",1525570248

As I watched bitcoin get hijacked by people who wanted high fees I knew we needed a fork.  

This was never about scale in my opinion, it was all about fees.  

Some wanted high fees.   What group would want high fees?  Miners.  

The miners had taken over and the users were forgotten.  

It's funny because BCH is always accused of being a group of miners.  

Why would miners want cheap fees???  

Try to look at the whole thing from the persepective of two groups, one wanting low fees and one wanting high fees.  

Of these two groups witch is closer to the vision of Satoshi and the original white paper??  

Cheap fees changes the world,,, high fees just helps rich white people avoid taxes.

"We'll agree to disagree on some points but I don't find you unreasonable either. Cherry picking data is a problem with cryptocurrency in general; technical analysis of the protocol, status of the network, and price has no standard or authority to hold anyone accountable. Wild west, haha.

I only speak from the experience of having to deal with mempool issues (and transaction malleability) in the past on the front lines. The devs get to watch it and discuss it and plan around it and take the amount of time they find appropriate to fix it the way they find correct. I find it's common for cryptocurrency developers to trivialize or down play issues; they have nothing on the line and the general public holding (giving value to the currency) have no capability of assessing how critical any issue really is. ""Store of value"" is the ultimate FU to those who have built businesses on using it as a currency; essentially it's a roundabout ""GTFO"".

I've been told I'm spreading FUD more times than I can count from people who have no idea what it's like to support a company accepting and processing payments, deposits and withdrawals going way back before 2x or segwit was even being discussed. I had to put fires out and work around things at the significant expense of enterprise. There was a lot of me reminding clients that Bitcoin as a whole ""is all a big experiment"". It always made myself and the business look incompetent, and if you come out to speak about technical issues now you become a political martyr regardless of true intentions.

"Today on a pump (and probably later dump) day the figures are like that, but if you look to the block size of the last 30 days the size of Bcash blocks is less than 10% of BTC. Then consider the fact that Bitcoin transactions are way smaller in moderate through Segwit and batching while the value is much higher (few thousand USD per transaction for BTC and probably like 100 USD for BCH, is just a simple guess, but Bcash is much used for small and tiny transactions like the tipprbot).

[Network science on belief system
dynamics under logic constraints](http://sci-hub.hk/http://science.sciencemag.org/content/354/6310/321)

Specifically....

&gt; We report a generalization of the Friedkin-Johnsen model (15‚Äì17) that achieves this integration. When individuals‚Äô beliefs on multiple statements are being influenced, the FriedkinJohnsen model assumes that a change of belief on one statement does not affect beliefs on other statements. 

To bring this back to the faction of /r/btc or BU/big block vs the Core, small block, decentralized faction.....

&gt;A shared logic constraint structure on a set of truth statements (e.g., if X is true, then Y
and Z are true) does not imply belief consensus. It will polarize a population into two opposing ideological factions when high certainty of belief on one central statement implies high certainties of belief on all other statements, and
low certainty of belief on that central statement implies low certainties of belief on all other statements. One faction accepts the premise of the central statement and thus accepts all the other statements as true; the other rejects the premise of the central statement and thus rejects all the other statements as false.

You see this endlessly perpetuated in politics. You see one faction completely ignore all the truthful statements of the other faction because they no longer believe in the central statement. Similarly, the same has occured here where because of the social division created by theymos (not singlehandedly of course, but also because of Gavin and other factors). 

Now, we get to what I see as the meat and potato's of the issue. People are now ideologically divided into factions and evidence based research is no longer effective against ideologically driven agendas. To understand this better....

&gt;In our model (Fig. 1), individual nodes have different certainties of belief on multiple truth statements, which may be changed through their interactions with others. The nodes may vary in their levels of closure-openness to influence. Each node‚Äôs integration of their own and others‚Äô displayed certainties of belief may be subject to logical interdependencies among statements.

The paper goes into an illustrative example to explain this...its long, but well worth the read to understanding this phenomenon. 

&gt;We next show how the 1992‚Äì2003 fluctuations of the U.S. population‚Äôs certainties of belief on
truth statements involved in the decision to invade Iraq may be understood. During the period
1992 to 2002, U.S. public opinion polls indicated  that a slight majority supported an invasion of
Iraq, and that a strong majority favored waiting for the conclusion of UN inspections on the status
of Iraq‚Äôs weapons of mass destruction (19‚Äì22). In January 2003, President Bush‚Äôs State of the Union address included a threat assessment of Iraq‚Äôs weapons and intentions. He stated, ‚ÄúWe will consult, but let there be no misunderstanding: If Saddam Hussein does not fully disarm for the safety of our people, and for the peace of the world, we will lead a coalition to disarm him.‚Äù In February 2003, Colin Powell, the highly respected U.S. Secretary of State and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke to the UN Security Council. Polling just prior to the speech indicated that a strong majority of the public viewed Powell‚Äôs forthcoming speech as an important factor in settling their minds about an attack on Iraq (23). The speech (24) presented a logic structure on three truth statements:

&gt;Statement 1. Saddam Hussein has a stockpile
of weapons of mass destruction.


&gt;Statement 2. Saddam Hussein‚Äôs weapons of
mass destruction are real and present dangers
to the region and to the world.


&gt;Statement 3. A preemptive invasion of Iraq
would be a just war.


&gt;It was a logic structure in which high certainty of belief on statement 1 implies high certainty of belief on statements 2 and 3. Powell concluded his speech with the words, ‚ÄúWe must not shrink from whatever is ahead of us. We must not fail in our duty and our responsibility to the citizens of the countries that are represented by this body.‚Äù In March 2003, the U.S. government announced that ‚Äúdiplomacy has failed‚Äù and that it would proceed without UN Security Council approval with a ‚Äúcoalition of the willing.‚Äù President Bush spoke to the American
public and announced Operation Iraqi Freedom. He stated, ‚ÄúThe people of the United States and our friends and allies will not live at the mercy of an outlaw regime that threatens the peace with weapons of mass murder.‚Äù The 2003 invasion of Iraq began a few days later. In the immediate March-May aftermath of the invasion, polling indicated a surge to strong majority support of the preemptive invasion. With the failure to find any evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, polling indicated that a strong majority of the public believed that the
Iraq War was based on incorrect assumptions (25). In September 2005, Colin Powell acknowledged that his UN speech was based on flawed intelligence reports.


&gt;Two events underlie the fluctuation of public opinion on the war. The first event set up a logic structure and a conclusion. If statement 1 is true, then statements 2 and 3 are true, and the available evidence indicates that statement 1 is without doubt true. The ensuing public discourse elevated the belief that an invasion was justified. The invasion occurred. The second event, no weapons of mass destruction were found, altered the conclusion of the logic structure. The ensuing public discourse elevated the belief that the invasion was unjustified. For if statement 1 is false, then statements 2 and 3 are also false, and the available evidence indicates that statement 1 is without doubt false.

This should help demonstrate what has been going on in our community.",1525565414
"Reducing electricity consumption is not vital to fighting off extinction - ensuring capacity is a art of ensuring this for sure. By ensuring capacity you sure up a way of life - hospitals, warmth etc.  Changing how that capacity is generated from fossil to green/renewables is key and is starting to or is happening the world over. Even in the US where the current president seems hell bent on fossil fuels (for whatever reason - not a topic for here) green energy is happening and it‚Äôs winning. 

Extinction aside for a minute (as that‚Äôs as bad as some the babies are dying calls that ‚Äòjesus‚Äô preaches these days - bitcoin is not the major user of electricity nor will it be in the future. The basis of bitcoins so called electricity consumption is flawed (see links below).

I don't really work for an employer. I work for my father, and help him make fresh pasta and raviolis. I earn about $100 a month since restaurants are not ordering much product this last year. But that's not a problem since I still live with my parents. The world doesn't really work like America does. I'm a 23 year old, with lots of family issues, been forced to do (or not to do) things the last year or so and it has been terrible...

I guess you can find advantages and positives in any negative thing, any disgrace, any scandal. I hope you enjoy your house!
I was judging those over 40 because most of them are obtuse people, afraid of what they don't know and don't understand. Not that they want to. People nowadays are allergic to information, those of my age more than your's, but at least we are open minded. And just to be clear I am not defending teenagers and youngsters. Most of them listen to shitty commercial music, watch blockbusters, and never read books. But I can't bear the ignorant arrogance of the middle aged. 

I don't understand how you can copy bitcoin, but if I understood correctly what you are expressing here, I guess you should be following and praising some traditional investment subreddit, the mighty real estate market. Go go Warren Buffet. 

And as for alternatives I have been saying it for a lot of time now. Bitcoin gave the start, but it doesn't have anything special considering most other coins. I personally am a very passionate fan of Monero, but I am confident there are other good coins, even some good tokens. 

But just to be clear, Bitcoin can be divided up to 8 digits (called satoshis), yet most uneducated traders will surely think bitcoin is too expensive. They are nice for bubbles, we can profit a lot from the public participation that buys high and sells low. But in the long run, almost everyone of us wants that breed gone, we want educated people that aim for the adoption of crypto, not just speculation and the ""let's get rich and buy a lambo"". Of course I'm trading, and profiting as much as I can, why wouldn't I do it? It might give me some financial freedom and finally leave this damn shithole of a country. Study somewhere in northern Europe. Create and maintain my own life. I suggest you do the same. Take care and don't work your ass off.

One issue is the ‚ÄúBitcoin Cash = Bitcoin‚Äù crowd seems to not have a strict definition of what ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äù is. Before, it was [Gavin‚Äôs definition](http://gavinandresen.ninja/a-definition-of-bitcoin) which basically says ‚Äúthe longest chain wins‚Äù. For a while that‚Äôs what Bitcoin XT etc was going for. After that since BCH is clearly not the longest chain there‚Äôs an evolved definition about the ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù protocol but that is a loose concept too as a lot of the transaction types we use these days came from forks after the original white paper. It‚Äôs hard to argue what a name means when there is no concise definition of said term.

Also, Bitcoin Cash came from a lack of consensus especially from miners. The fork initially clearly branded itself as ‚ÄúBitcoin Cash‚Äù, even though it puts itself as closer to the original vision. This rebranding itself as ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äù un-ironically is actually making the coin lose credibility and reputation among the greater crypto crowd. E.g. Ethereum Classic doesn‚Äôt say it is ‚ÄúEthereum‚Äù without extra qualifications. Like it or not, it was Bitcoin Cash‚Äôs decision to fork and given it is still a minority hash chain I can‚Äôt really say ‚ÄúBitcoin Cash is Bitcoin‚Äù with a straight face. I will say it‚Äôs my preferred protocol that fulfills what Bitcoin‚Äôs vision more though.

Also, NEOs ATH in january lagged a bit behind ETHs ATH. so if anything it seems to be currently it would make most sense to stay in ETH and perhaps switch over to NEO if ETH is about to dip &amp; retrace, because NEO might still be on the raise then.

BCH, just like BTC, is a honey badger that does not care about individuals revolving around it. It's code that people run voluntarily that matter. If the code is good, safe and has purpose it does not matter if it's Satan himself who wrote it - it's still good. After having seen drama for 8 years now in the community I've become immune to appeals on any level except for code and economic incentive. From this potision BTC looks weak - which is reflected in low marketcap / stagnation in amount of transactions / other alts gain relatively. Lightning is a losing proposition from my standpoint, extremely premature to scale offchain. And megalomaniac not to let on/off chain scaling compete so the market can discover the right ratio between on and off chain transactions. You can't compare Ponzi scheme like Madoff and Bitconnect with BCH. BCH is utilizing the exact same mechanism that BTC did the first 7 years. How can that blockchain possibly become a fraud over night by not changing the code? Does not matter if Ver is a fraud. BCH's blockchain is mined, same rules as in the whitepaper and no coins have been granted to anyone not already owning BTC before the split.

"1. No FUD here. Please, stop assuming things for even just one comment. I got in because it was cheap and allowed me to buy thousands of coins, which I liked and figured was a good risk/return. And, again, it was a marketing/PR play for me. Justin pumps the shit out of that coin. I rode the wave to a 3000% return. But, I didn‚Äôt believe it was worth the 30 cents, and I ended up really disliking Justin, so I sold. He doesn‚Äôt act professional. Announcements about future announcements, which are never anything big. Pictures with well-known people, insinuating something is in the works, which pumps the coin, then nothing comes of it. The ridiculous whitepaper that is full of buzzwords and is semi-plagiarized. The ridiculous claims that TRX will be bigger than ETH, with absolutely no basis for that comment or comparison. His twitter feuds with people. The very plausible selling of millions of shares. The coin lockup period being extremely short- 2 years when Justin has stated TRON is a 10-year project. It‚Äôs all too much. It‚Äôs not FUD. Those things happened, and they are extremely valid reasons to stay away from the project. I never believed in the technology and still don‚Äôt. If the tech was so amazing, why did they need to plagiarize a whitepaper and fill it with buzzwords? Why all the need to pump the coin? Why such a short lockup period (1/5th of the project timeline)? You can call it FUD all you want, and I know you will (I‚Äôve been in r/Tronix, which resembles a cult, and is what r/PeoplesTemple or r/JimJones would look like). But, these are valid concerns and questions. I‚Äôd say I made the right choice selling when I did, but time will tell. Nothing wrong with locking in profits. It allowed me many of the opportunities I have today. 

2. None of the coins I listed are crazy, under the radar coins. Even the smallest project out of all of them in terms of market cap, XBY (Xtrabytes), is well-known, albeit for the wrong reasons, and that is my complete wildcard play. ITC and EVX are really the only ones that aren‚Äôt talked about a lot. Could you elaborate? The rest are well established coins. 

3. I know the rule, and I used to be 80% into ETH, but have since gotten more into altcoins after riding ETH from $200 to around $1200. ETH was my first dip into crypto. So, I didn‚Äôt know much and was only on Coinbase. But, then I got really into crypto while holding ETH, and that opened the floodgates. I know I have way too many coins. ‚ÄòBeing too diversified is like not being diversified at all‚Äô. I have tried to trim down my coins, but haven‚Äôt been able to. I believe in all the projects I hold. I have coins that I would/will sell before others, like a ranking system, but none that I am willing to part with now.

Don't you think that you got it backwards on who spit on consensus?",1525556388
"You have that all backwards.

BTC added: Replace By Fee, SegWit, and keeps a 1mb block size that was *never* supposed to remain, *disabled* opcodes or crippled them. 

BCH *removed:* Replace by Fee, never even added SegShit, and in May is fully restoring the *original* 32mb maximum threshold it had on day one, and enabling and restoring

"""Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin""",1525556316
"Per the whitepaper, bitcoin is the longest POW chain, but that only applies to a chain that actually follows the definition of what makes bitcoin bitcoin.

BTC is a fork. BCH is a fork. BTG is a fork... they're all forks. One could argue that BTC is not a fork... well if you try syncing it with Satoshi's original version of bitcoin, it doesn't sync... because it is, itself, a fork.

So what makes bitcoin bitcoin? I think it's easy to see that in order to be bitcoin, it has to hold the properties of what bitcoin is designed to have, which is that it can be used as cash with fast transactions, low fees, and censorship resistance. By the very definition of bitcoin, BCH is the bitcoin because it is the longest POW chain that is, by definition, bitcoin. BTC has a longer POW chain, but it is no longer bitcoin because it no longer has those properties.

BTC changed the definition from digital cash into a settlement layer for the Lightning Network (clearly LN is not bitcoin), with high fees, long transactions times, and without censorship resistance (due to its reliance on LN). Those facts make it not bitcoin.

Here's an example... let's say 90% of hashpower decided to turn bitcoin into Pizza Hut gift cards, which can be accepted at Pizza Hut locations worldwide. Is this chain that is now mining Pizza Hut giftcards simply because 90% of hashpower is now mining that chain, or is the 10% hashpower chain that is still mining the bitcoin that was defined by the whitepaper now bitcoin? If one argues that the Pizza Hut giftcards are now bitcoin, they do not understand bitcoin.",1525556296

"&gt; Thus, Bitcoin has become the ultimate speculative investment because there is nothing externally which drives its price, i.e., Bitcoin has no earnings, and thus no quarterly projections to hit or miss.

Um... the driver would be adoption.  As in, Japan, South Korea, other markets all spinning up on a single global currency.  Japan is 40% of the market and they have the 2020 Olympics coming up.  S.Korea is 5% of the market and they're working on being entirely digital currencies by 2020 with bitcoin among their plans. The concerning thing is USDT (tether) is 23% of the market (would be nice to see that gotten rid of entirely)... but USDT is not entirely US based.  And, the US is less than 25% of the market.

And, secondly... bitcoin is not a company, so there are no projections, etc... that would require market manipulation. The closest to projections you can get are mining operations and that's been set out clearly (the number of bitcoins mined) for 9 years now.  ",1525556277
"For $15 million he could take Bitcoin to nearly $0. Marketcap means nothing here. Market cap for a business represents real assets, earnings, IP, and the potential sale price of the company.

The part that I think it misses is that the main BCH chain can remain very simple, and have smart contracts built on top of it as additional layers that are tied back to the very simple main chain.

There is no reason that I'm aware of that something like ETH couldn't be built as an additional layer on *top* of BCH. In fact, I believe this was the original plan for ETH before BTC told Vitalik to go shoo.

"You're wrong actually. Check out this article from Gavin: http://gavinandresen.ninja/are-bigger-blocks-better-for-bigger-miners

Big blocks are actually BAD for decentralization, and in a pretty dramatic way. The bigger the blocks, the more profitable the biggest mining pool becomes. So, joining a mining pool other than the largest one will actually mean losing money. Good luck convincing people to voluntarily give up profits. Gavin used two assumptions to come to the conclusion that big mining pools were up to .3% more profitable than individual miners/small mining pools: there was a cap on transaction size (There isn't in BCH) and 20mb blocks (BCH is 32mb and will eventually grow exponentially larger). So, that .3% is inevitably going to balloon up.

This is why Roger has argued in the past that decentralization is not a core tenet of BCH. He knows that BCH is going to be much more centralized than Bitcoin. This is always why I personally don't get why BCH supporters always try to compete with and slander Bitcoin - they're two completely different ideas at this point and aren't really competing. ",1525556106
Not based so much on time. I would say if BTC has another two or three catastrophic fee events as we saw late last year and is still commanding the lead or if some other crypto (I won't speculate which) takes the #1 spot rather than BCH. Then you can say that it's probably game over.,1525556073

"&gt;Roger Ver is doing for Bitcoin Cash, the same exact thing he did for Bitcoin before the fork. Why weren't bitcoiners complaining about him then? 

He did not have the same amount of power in BTC community. Before the split, bitcoin had plenty of key figures with multiple thoughts on bitcoins future. No one was seen as ""the"" leader and therefore different opinions were accepted in the community.

But after the split, something happened with the communities and Roger Ver got way too much power in the BCH community. He is almost seen as a leader over a decentralized coin. People in the crypto community oppose the idea of a leader and that's why I think people hate BCH so much. 

&gt;core supporters crying about ""bitcoin core"" as well while trying to rebrand bricoin cash as ""bcash""

I think it is two different things. Calling  Bitcoin cash for Bcash is an abbreviation. People used it to say/spell it faster. But after Roger went crazy on air and calling out people for using it a new meme was born. People purposely used bcash just to piss them off. The idea that a person takes offence over a decentralized coins name is absurd. That only shows how much power he has.

Bitcoin core is, on the other hand, a longer name and adding an unnecessary word to it. It is only used to differentiate bitcoin cash from bitcoin. And only after the Roger drama people started to take offence from it. Only because they were not allowed to call Bitcoin cash for bcash. Why would they accept being called bitcoin core?

"Using the pubkey-hash (as Memo does) makes more sense than writing the full address into each transaction. The address includes extra bytes which aren't necessary in this context, and also ties you forever to the legacy address format. For comparison, bitcoin p2pkh transactions themselves write the pubkey-hash to the transaction - not the full address.

BTW, even though I'm posting in this thread, I definitely don't think you guys are ""disgusting competition"". But, I do think you're making a mistake by being incompatible with Memo. The risk of ""forking their protocol"" is practically zero. As long as your don't do something silly like re-use an existing action code to mean something different, I can't even see how you *would* fork it. If you have cool ideas to extend the protocol, just do it in a new action code! If it's cool enough, Memo will likely implement it too.

I also think it's not too late for you to change to be compatible with Memo - it's still so early in your product's life. I think it would be better for you (and Memo, and BCH as a whole) in the long run, because you'd get to share in all of Memo's existing and future network effect.",1525554453

BTC never had to compete, they just had to come up with a compromise to help other developers with other use cases for BTC.  They could have worked WITH the ETH developers (before ETH even existed).  The Core devs fucked it up, and from this side of the fence, it looks intentional.  The Core devs could have said: ""OK.  We understand what you're trying to do.

"To be fair, you have to have a very high amount of research to understand Bitcoin. The algorithm is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of Byzantine fault tolerance most of the code will go over a typical person's head. There‚Äôs also Bitcoins nihilistic outlook on the future of banking, which is deftly woven into it's philosophy - Satoshis ideas draw heavily from  Nick Szabo's and Wei Dai's writing, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these visions, to realise that they‚Äôre not just bold - they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Bitcoin truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn‚Äôt appreciate, for instance, the humour in r/bitcoins catchphrase ‚Äúhodl,‚Äù which itself is a cryptic reference to a post a fat fingered guy made on bitcointalk. I‚Äôm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as luke-jr‚Äôs genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens screens. What fools.. how I pity them. üòÇ

"Not entirely following the logic.    You admit the money part is important, thank heavens.    But, why hung up on Bitcoin, the name, the brand, being the most critical end goal.   Think about it, if Bitcoin Cash becomes more valuable, and is on it's way to the original bitcoin chain dying off, haven't you already won?   You got the money part you first mentioned.   You succeeded in growing the value of the coin and users, without needing the sole Bitcoin.   

Unless the path to success does include some trickery in gaining adoption because it's a flavor of Bitcoin, which has some magic power.   It's a weird one to think about.   But no one right now cares to think about the dichotomy between the flavor name the the original name.      Also, if BCH ever does win and original btc dies off,  you still have the BCH ticker.

Bitfinex: Offers mobile app and a popular exchange. You can also lend crypto here to earn interest.

KuCoin: One of the strongest exchange that also offers a mobile app. They have been constantly updating their mobile app to make it one of the best in the industry.

Gate.io: Many new cryptos can be found here. Unique approach and something you should signup for in 2018. Also offers mobile app just like KuCoin and Binance. However, volume is not great.

Changelly: Perfect for quick crypto exchange. Easy to use and great for beginners.

Bittrex: Another high-quality exchange with a lot of coins.

"Such a rule does not exist, obviously. However, the idea of a minority chain becoming the dominant chain constitutes a failure of the proof-of-work consensus system that underpins bitcoin. This is especially true if you consider two forks to be in competition for legitimacy.

In order for the minority chain to overcome the majority, either the hash power which has previously been put to work ensuring the future consistency of the majority chain must defect from that consensus or the minority chain must attract a substantial share of new hash power. Since bitcoin's consensus system is probabilistic, it can handle  -in fact, requires- some temporary uncertainty about the head of the chain. That uncertainty is expected to resolve quickly as the majority aligns on a common view of the chain.

The exact time that it takes is not dictated by the protocol, but the intent is to allow sufficient observation as to be confident that the majority of work capacity has been extended in extending the chain underconsideration. Bitcoin Cash had more than sufficient opportunity to obtain a majority hash rate.

ABC did start the fork officially, and if it was only ABC running the network then it probably would be Bitcoin ABC instead of Bitcoin Cash, but since there were more than one client with others like XT and BU that have been around long before ABC that always supported 8mb+ block size it made no sense to use the Bitcoin ABC title alone in this case.

My personal opinion is that the distinction between Bitcoin BTC and Bitcoin Cash BCH is both fine __and useful__ for now. Adopters need to know that the BTC fork isn't useful as cash and that if you are wanting to use the coin as Cash then you obviously pick the token called Bitcoin Cash for your transactions.

It's clear to me that in time BCH will assert its utility over BTC, and when the hashpower moves as a result, the ""name"" if necessary will be carried across once BCH has the greatest proof of work (i.e. people will naturally start referring to Bitcoin Cash as merely Bitcoin). When the greatest proof of work chain moves across BCH there could be no reasonable contention about the use of the name.

Bcash thus can lay no claim to the name of the original chain. One could also argue that even if Bcash was able to obtain majority consensus it cannot lay claim to the Bitcoin name because the original chain was still operational, but that does not even matter because bcash totally failed to obtain majority.

Understand my entire post above.  *IF* these altcoin blockchains had real utility, then your point would be valid.  *BUT THESE ALTCOIN BLOCKCHAINS HAVE NO REAL SUBSTANTIAL USE*.  Let me reiterate.  *NOBODY ACTUALLY PLANS TO SERIOUSLY USE THESE ALTCOIN BLOCKCHAINS*.

Of course, the projects want buyers to believe they are useful, or will be useful in the future.  They need this belief to exist to fuel the excitement and FOMO.  After all the primary goal is accelerated price increase.  And it works.  Not because the selling-points are all that convincing in themselves, but because many people *WANT SO BADLY FOR IT TO BE TRUE*.

Do yourself a massive favor.  Take a step back for 2 minutes right now.

1) No. Bitcoin is not a name that can be used by any contender. You and your buddies in rbtc can do that, but noone else does. 

2) ""Consensus"" in the context of Bitcoin does not mean that you, me and your boss we all have to agree. Consensus is defined by the software running on our nodes.
Consensus is formed by following the same rules. Bitcoin nodes achieve consensus by following the Bitcoin network rules. If your software follows bitcoin rules, you are running bitcoin. If it follows a different set, you are running an altcoin software

3) No. Neither the free market, nor the miners decide. Its users do, by running the software and following the same set of rules that creates consensus, aka the Nakamoto Consensus.

This is in addition to Bitcoin itself, which is already a complex topic. However, as Lightning matures, we‚Äôll be working to improve the Lightning user experience to become more simple, intuitive and familiar. Ideally, users like Carol will manage balances, payments and deposits without having to understand the underlying technology, and the experience will be cheaper and more convenient than existing payment technologies (checks, credit cards, physical cash, etc.).

"&gt;You said it‚Äôs entitled to the name. Then you said it‚Äôs not entitled to the name because it didn‚Äôt have consensus. Consensus is not something that had to have happened at a single point in time, in the past. I already answered this. My entire previous post was explaining why you contradicted yourself. Maybe read it?

I said, free market is what gives you the right to say so, which is exactly the same right as the core said has to attack BCH, since it's a free market. Your taking points out of context fucking idiot. I DONT AGREE with this, which is the whole fucking point 

&gt;No. It‚Äôs not a contradiction.  It‚Äôs not a free market function, to change the definition of a fork. So I am fully in my right to tell you that you‚Äôre defining something wrong. That doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm saying the ‚Äúfree market is invalid‚Äù. Your logic is so fucking ridiculous I don‚Äôt even know where to begi**n.

&gt;What what? So for the same free market example you give now it isn't again? What the fuck do you have the right to tell me what the right definition is? It's your argument, yet you are telling me otherwise. How is my (read your) logic irrelevant since you are making that point. 

&gt;It‚Äôs not BTC. It is a contender for the ‚Äúbitcoin‚Äú name.  It‚Äôs a fork.  BTC will always be BTC. But the concept of bitcoin? Forks are all viable contenders for that. The free market decides which one wins.  Deal with it.   That‚Äôs how forks work. 

And there it is, this is the whole reason you disagree, BTC = Bitcoin and BCH = Bitcoin cash, you are only finding reasons to say it isn't, yet you use the same fucking hypocritical reasons you blame me for. So what is it? Free market or not? Or just any point that's fits your native more? It's not since you confine to ethics yet here your have different ethics to me yet you state yours as a fact. 

It‚Äôs not my opinion. It‚Äôs reality. This is a consensus-based decentralized open-source project that is run by the free market. You will find that out the hard way. You‚Äôre finding it out right now as the entire industry is adding BCH despite your worst fears. That‚Äôs called the free market. Welcome to crypto. Don‚Äôt like it? Leave.

Bingo! So what are your complaining about? Again I hold BCH, but not because it is BTC, but because it is a serious contender to the main adoption market. Never argued that, I still like BCH, but imo it's not BTC, it's really that simple.

They want to be ""Bitcoin"" and Bitcoin cash to become BCASH to distance it from bitcoin.  I would be happy to stop referring to it as Bitcoin Core if they had another preference such as Bitcoin SL (segwit lightning) or whatever but I doubt they would accept anything other than ""Bitcoin"".

"Just my opinion on what happened sin January:

* the usual annual dip like previous years (some redditors has posted a nice summary graphics somewhere)

* the dip compounded with daily FUD news released like clockwork about crypto ban, hacked exchanges.... I have a news aggregator set up and I remembered receiving these FUD news one after another, and never on the same day. Like, every gain day was matched with a FUD news the day after. Really make you wonder if someone or a group of someone coordinating all this.

* BTC price did climb back to $11,000 level but then the Mt. Gox trustee happened, pushing it down again - the TA people may call this the ""bull trap"".

* Finally, some sort of a big liquidation event happened on 4/12/2018 that jumpstarted the bull run we have seen til today, https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8bqb8d/we_just_witnessed_the_biggest_1hr_volume_in_the/
Look at the chart and you can see that huge spike out of nowhere.

So, judging from that 4/12 event, things seem to be stable and bullish for about 2 weeks now. I think it is still early to really call it stable and I also think that all it takes is one big sell-off and we are back to bearish again. At the same time, it is possible that price will take off from there and to the moon.",1525539275

"&gt;Contradicted myself how? 


You said it‚Äôs entitled to the name. Then you said it‚Äôs not entitled to the name because it didn‚Äôt have consensus. Consensus is not something that had to have happened at a single point in time, in the past. I already answered this. My entire previous post was explaining why you contradicted yourself. Maybe read it?

&gt;In that same statement you state free market is what drives the name, which is perfectly fine to say but with that you claim it's unfair to state otherwise which is a contradiction 


No. It‚Äôs not a contradiction.  It‚Äôs not a free market function, to change the definition of a fork. So I am fully in my right to tell you that you‚Äôre defining something wrong. That doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm saying the ‚Äúfree market is invalid‚Äù. Your logic is so fucking ridiculous I don‚Äôt even know where to begin.

&gt;I do support BCH but I don‚Äôt think it is BTC 

It‚Äôs not BTC. It is a contender for the ‚Äúbitcoin‚Äú name.  It‚Äôs a fork.  BTC will always be BTC. But the concept of bitcoin? Forks are all viable contenders for that. The free market decides which one wins.  Deal with it.   That‚Äôs how forks work. 

&gt;So, if that free-for-all market idea you have is your opinion, it‚Äôs fine too, 


It‚Äôs not my opinion. It‚Äôs reality. This is a consensus-based decentralized open-source project that is run by the free market. You will find that out the hard way. You‚Äôre finding it out right now as the entire industry is adding BCH despite your worst fears. That‚Äôs called the free market. Welcome to crypto. Don‚Äôt like it? Leave.

In the tradition of the 1880s Order of the Golden Dawn a watchtower or guardian in ceremonial and derived neopagan magical tradition is a tutelary spirit of one of the four cardinal points or ""quarters"" (north, east, south, and west). They are also variously associated in many traditions with each the four classical elements (earth, air, fire, and water) and stars (Fomalhaut, Aldebaran, Regulus, and Antares). The Watchtowers are invoked during the ritual of casting a magic circle.

Alternately, ""Watchtowers"" may refer specifically to the abodes of the Guardians, with the guardians themselves referred to as ""Watchers"" or simply ""Guardians"".

"I think we just differ in our opinions, but thats OK... people are accepting crypto not because they want to covert it to fiat, but because there are more and more avenues opening up to spending crypto every day. This is true especially for internet based businesses. Im not talking about lawyers and corporate but for people selling software, games, etc they are pushing the adoption of crypto by using crypto. And when travelling in countries like Thailand, Singapore, You see some shops accepting crypto too.   

With 1 BTC I can hit the bank account of any person in any country in no time. With $10,000 I can spend it only in USA. Crypto is a lot more global than any fiat currency. If you are travelling a lot crypto makes so much sense. Forget converting your funds to another currency at the airport and stuff. And there are people actually using crypto for this (especially BTC)  

&gt; If you are a business and you are selling something you are in many countries legally required to keep records about who you sold the item to so at this point it does not matter if the payment was anonymous as you still know who bought it.

&gt;  i use my creditcard and there are unauthorized payments i notify my bank and they take care of it.

This is the problem. In many countries its not the case. Banks make  you run around. If its a debit card, good luck getting anything out of these banks. Card phishers and scammers are everywhere, your money is as good as gone.

Having said that, BTC is attempting to implement vaporware called Lightning network which has been proven to be mathematically impossible. They've deliberately stopped growth of the BTC network by constraining the blocksize at 1mb. This was done by a company called Blockstream who wish to control the network and charge fees on top of miner fees, they're literally turning Bitcoin into their private business.

Bitcoin Cash however is decentralized, with a large blocksize (32mb shortly) and rapid adoption both in terms of users and businesses, read a while in /r/btc and you'll see what I've said is true.

You can patent specific bits of code that do stuff on the chain in certain ways, but if someone else builds that idea in a totally unique and non-referential way it's likely they won't be in breach of patent.

In fact my point is that if Bitcoin Cash takes off, people will wonder ""why are we using Bitcoin Cash and not Bitcoin"" - this will spawn several news stories about how Bitcoin got taken over and people are more likely to be educated about the whole censorship history and the great blocksize debate.

"&gt; Can you give an example of such inefficient way to protect people from fraud that squashes legitimate projects in cryptospace?

How can I do that? We both agree there is not much regulation of cryptocurrency, yet (thankfully). I will, however, give an example of other regulation that does this. There is regulation investment brokers like [Peter Schiff](https://www.youtube.com/user/SchiffReport) must follow. Peter is highly successful with business projects including [Euro Pacific Capital](http://www.europac.com/), an investment firm Peter says he founded in 1980 in his apartment. He says there is no way he afford to start such a company today with all the regulation and compliance he must keep up with. He spends so much time trying to comply with things he has an entire department doing nothing but compliance, and he still sometimes makes costly mistakes because the regulation either isn't clear or is structured in such a way as to be almost impossible to do practically 100% of the time. 

We've been talking awhile and you can probably tell I'm not the type to set up some scam. I've been in crypto a long time and can probably spot good investments. For example I was there when Coinbase first announced its formation on Bitcointalk and I said they would do well. They are one of the biggest companies if not the biggest in crypto. What if I wanted to offer investment services? In crypto I could probably structure something, but if I wanted U.S. customers, even with an offshore company as Euro Pacific Capital, is I'd need to comply with U.S. securities regulations. I wouldn't even attempt it. I'm busy with other items anyway. However, Peter, a longtime expert in that industry mentions all the scams he hears about, gullible people falling for obviously shady investment offerings. They advertise in various ways, commercials, print, whatever. There is no way regulators can investigate all the offerings. So people sign up and get duped. The scammers don't intend to hang around anyway so they are free from worrying about proper compliance. There projects I imagine are just small scale enough that when they blow up the people can disappear without any real repercussions. In the worst case they could always retire somewhere out of the country if needed. My point is someone like me who might actual provide a valuable, legitimate service that could make people real money would totally be missing from competing in the marketplace, leaving a higher proportion of scammers for people to fall prey to.",1525533618

Roger doing such things without broad industry support is just confusing for new people when using Bitcoin.com. I agree that Bitcoin was totally hijacked and it wasn't fair in the slightest, but exchanges and cap sites call it Bitcoin whether we like it or not, what Roger has been doing lately isn't helping the cause and looks childish to the outside.

"Nothing wrong with calling BCH Bitcoin Cash, especially while it still does not have most cumulative proof-of-work.  

On the other hand, I don't think there's anything hugely wrong if you want to jump the gun a little and call it Bitcoin (BCH) as long as you give a good justification for why you're doing it. To me BCH is by far more Bitcoin according to white paper and valid Nakamoto Consensus. BTC is only ""Bitcoin"" right now if you consider *invalid* Nakamoto Consensus (since it is cheating with SegWit added, but no 2x activated).",1525532741
"Which part of the chain of events and logic you don't get?

- SegWit was proposed... it got very low consensus, not even 1/2 the miners supported it.
- UASF was a forceful threat to activate it, it did not go through because
- SegWit2X was being agreed upon by every miner, except 1, which meant consensus was reached but it had to include raising blocks to 2MB also.
- SegWit part from SegWit2X was done, but Core/Blockstream and few miners started backing out on the 2X deal and it was eventually called off, by that time Bitcoin Cash forked already, saved the code from SegWit crap, upgraded actual Bitcoin system to *MB blocks... and so on.

Maybe you should get re-educated if you can't follow this logic and stop wasting time in like thinking you got it all figured out... Bcash propaganda won't get you far... and now you can piss off and stop wasting my time. Get an IQ.",1525532734
"So because they forked in a manner that you don‚Äôt agree with, it disqualifies it for the definition of a fork? 

No. That‚Äôs not how it works.  You don‚Äôt get to decide which changes disqualify it as a fork.

"It isn‚Äôt a false claim. 

Are *you* claiming that there is still less demand for cryptocurrency transactions than the 1MB limit allows (factoring in whatever discount SegWit is actually providing)? 

Very little activity has moved onto LN yet, so that‚Äôs not why you have seen small fees either.

The reason the problem settled down is because a ton of people just stopped trying to use BTC for anything. They may still be holding some, hoping the problems *actually* get solved. But that really hasn‚Äôt happened yet, and any modest increase in adoption will either send BTC fee back to the moon, or will simply go to a different coin.",1525532643

subs to /r/HailCorporate  but is also subbed to r/btc . Oh the irony,1525532478
"Of course, what you're describing is a trading bot with extra functionality (monitoring addresses).  Given that you're asking whether this is possible it'll almost certainly be better for you to look for something premade that you can buy - I'm a computer science major and made some trading bots in October-Jan and it took a lot of effort and even then I wasn't entirely comfortable just letting them run on their own for long periods of time, because so much can go wrong.    

Just a quick rundown of what you'd need to program in case you want to look at actually doing it yourself:    

-Each exchange has an API which you can query for prices, and you can set up a key that will give it privileges to trade on your account.  Read the API of something like bitstamp to get a feel for it.    

-A script that will monitor a bitcoin address; look into the API of a popular blockchain explorer to see this    

-Trading logic based on what you want, ie the script sends the info back to your main program that x btc has been received, then buys .10*x of the 10 biggest cryptos or whatever it is you wanna do.  The same but in reverse for when you press sell    

I'll repeat, it's a ton of effort.  I don't know if exactly what you're after is available on the market, but there will be products that are close.",1525532476
"Who gives a shit? Do you think anyone actually cares whether the person they are talking to about crypto is a boy or girl? 

We can discuss cryptocurrency here or you can bitch about ""muh sexist oppression"" etc... There's no affirmative action on the blockchain so unlike tech jobs, you're truly an equal. Google won't be there to give out free jobs for having a vagina, so there's no literally point in playing the sexism card.",1525532473
"I agree that there can only be a few currencies and most crypto that are trying to be currencies will fail.  The currencies that do make it will benefit due to failing government fiat currencies which due to unsustainable debt, is bound to accelerate in the coming years. Hell, most other cryptos that are not trying to be currencies will fail too. But the ones that make it will be absolutely massive.  The platforms that are being built right now will form the backbone of the new economy.  Check out omg, icon, Neo, aion for some players with huge opportunity in the next few years.   ",1525532439
So I'm confused. Did Bitcoin Cash fork from v0.1 or not? And how did Bitcoin Cash jump from 0.1 to  0.17 so quickly?,1525532411
"Except you don't actually pay instantly. Your payment actually goes through a process that includes steps like auth, capture, settlement, and sometimes reconciliation.

Auth is the first step. That's when you first open the transaction, you contact the bank and say you want to send x amount and they answer, yeah we think you have x in your account go ahead.

Capture is when the balance is actually deducted from your account and added to the recipient. Sometimes this happens right after auth, but often it happens some time later in batches because bank fees on the backend are discounted. The funds don't actually move yet, but you shouldn't be allowed go double spend that money if the system works right. The recipient might see a pending transaction for the amount but they also can't spend the money yet.

Settlement is when the funds actually move and that almost always happens several hours if not a day or two later. 

All of this happens between trusted parties with pre established relationships. 

So yeah if you have no idea how the current financial system works then I guess you might not see the benefit of crypto. ",1525532406

If there is a dispute, it will go to escrow for arbitration.

"No, but only because it is not new. Bitcoin IS perhaps the most obvious physical manifestation of a 'new' form of life. New being relative to geologic time. I am referring of course to the mind, which is simply an ecosystem of algorithms competing to replicate. Minds are great at solving problems faster than protein evolution. But they are limited in total variation of species because each mind is stored in a single complex, resource intensive biological hardware system.

The advent of computing has allowed minds to begin replicating their genes (algorithms) outside of an animal body. And replicate they will, because that is what life does.

As the other post intuits, Bitcoin by itself is not life because it does not change. Rather, some ecosystem of human civilization including Bitcoin is 'life'. But Bitcoin does change. The difficulty goes up. The algorithm is successfully replicating. 

This is no different than a primordial self-templating ribozyme (or whatever the early simple algorithms/molecules were). Is it life? Semantics. Everyone agrees that it eventually evolved into life",1525531763

This isn't really the case with Bitcoin Core which drives 95% of that network, and all other implementations have to follow what Bitcoin Core does as the developers really don't allow outsiders to have any say in what the protocol is.

"Interesting discussion.  Not as silly as it sounds at first.

I think there is still something crucial missing here, though. 

Life, to me, is all about changing things.  Which is, as the author says, part of the random mutation process.  Life takes in matter and/or energy and processes it in some innovative way to generate something entirely new.  Life has a goal of growing, not preserving things exactly the same.  Bitcoin's code is primarily about preserving Bitcoin (the quantitative value/volume of the currency).  It's like a photocopier, taking in information and outputting the same information.

Now the point about generating new code, in the form of forks like Bitcoin Cash, is an interesting one.  But that could be said about any open source software.  And even closed source software, really, since current computer languages are very limited and a particular software code can often be easily reproduced even without actually knowing the original.  (Hence copyright laws when there is a competitive environment.)

I think what it really comes down to is that the code/software itself is not self-functioning.  It's an extension of human efforts.  No humans = no Bitcoin (or any other computer software).  Perhaps this is a fetal stage of a new lifeform, though, where computer software can indeed run itself independently from humans, and reproduce new computer software that can run in diverse environments outside of the specific operating systems of human computers.",1525529840

"THANK YOU - This is my concern is that people will rush into buy ""BTC"" from traditional places but they are getting derivatives NOT the actual coin and don't own the keys. People will THINK they own some but NOPE. Could this then present a problem if let's say all those accounts get wiped out? What would happen say if there was a global economic downturn are those folks left holding ( NOT HODL ) the bag so to speak. I hope I'm making sense as I am still working on my 1st cup this am...

"It's a contract between two people to buy an asset at a certain price. One side thinks the price will go up and the other things it'll go down.

Because there is no limit to how high the price of an asset can go, this sort of contract means one can potentially lose an infinite amount of money if they're selling the short contract. Because the rising cost of bitcoin meant they had to make up the difference between the agreed price and the actual price, this person cashed out in lieu of losing even more money (cashing out caused them to lose 20 million dollars at the current price) ",1525528204

"Jed McCaleb is not Ripple anymore. He's got a contract telling him he can sell a certain % of daily volume (avg) every week. If he's gone rogue, then that does not count as Ripple, but rather Stellar trying to bring bad word against XRP.

The other founders and developers at Ripple HQ has no interest in dumping coins on the market, in fact, most of Ripple's holdings are in ESCROW and cannot be dumped (this is likely what started the last rally, as the dates match pretty well with escrow lockup).

The article doesn't state that he dumped the 600m XRP in the wallet, rather stated that there still was 600m XRP in the wallet (according to google translate? &gt;There are still 600,000,000 ripple in his wallet, and 40,000,000 ripple in the dumping account. This could simply be a whale securing profit of his investment, and yes, the price usually goes down when there's a sale.

Yes, there are whales in crypto. You don't blame a company for dumping the price of BTC or ETH at the time XRP fell? The whole market pulled back, not just XRP. ",1525528200
Inflation of a nation's currency is probably good for crypto prices because some people in that country would rather put their money in a cryptocurrency instead of seeing the value of their savings go down the drain.

"&gt;100% of core devs? What? There are over 500 developers with code in core. 

There are not over 500, active core developers, I should have said active core developers at the time. I would not consider Bashco a Core developer (you implied he is because he's on that list of 500) but he literally changes a spelling mistake in a single text file, and according to you that makes him a developer. 

If a Core developer supports the Core roadmap they are complicit and aligning themselves with the authority.  

For a meritocracy to be productive the most competent should lead, Core apparently is not a meritocracy if there are more competent people than those who define it. 

Which is it Core has incompetent leaders and is not a meritocracy or Core is a meritocracy and the most competent ideas are published. 

If Core is governed by incumbent developers and subordinate developers with less history can't express better opinions for fear of being kicked off the team, I rest my case.

You are living in denial, there is no evidence that they are the only ones funding it, but there is irrefutable evidence that money from Mastercard is paying for LN developers salaries. 

Here is what will happen when I give it to you. You will change your answer from **There is no evidence that Mastercard is funding LN** it doesn't matter. 

&gt;Controlling large nodes does not give you control over LN since a client is never locked into certain hubs or channels.

no one wants control over LN they just want data (the data the nodes need to rough payments). LN is a network if you can monitor network data you can control whatever is built on top of that network.

"The most PoW is aquired by having the highest hashrate. Miners want to make more money, so they mine the most expensive chain. 

Price is a factor based on public opinion, or demand, something that can be (and i think is) manipulated. BCH gained 9% on BTC today, and it would be rational to assume that the hashrate would follow. I don't really like roger ver, but am a fan of BCH.

Downvote me all you guys want, but i feel like there is a narrative being pushed that BCH is bad because of Roger Vers antics. We should attack the tech, not people. 

""BCASH is bad because it advertises itself as bitcoin"". It doesnt, Roger ver does this. ""Bcash is a fraud because it is fooling new people."" This is again done by users of the BCH protocol, and not BCH itself. 

Its like telling people to not use the internet because scammers are using the internet.

I would just love for people to have fair discussions without all this shitslinging we see on cryptoreddit or twitter.

From my point of view, the BCH community have a huge focus on adoption, and has more capacity in terms of Tx/s. I believe that BCH will achieve a higher adoption because of this and the lower fees. If this happens, price will follow, making miners mine the BCH chain for higher profits, making the BCH chain have the most work. 

It is a race of adoption, and we will see if LN is able to outrace BCH. Ln does have a pretty high barrier of entry, with always online LN nodes and funded channels and everything, slowing down adoption further. LN is cool, if they manage to get it to work effectively.

The only other off-chain transaction metric that you would have information on would be exchange volumes, but that's unfortunately exactly as fallacious as market cap for the same reason (no wash trading control or visibility, value measured against fiat), so I guess if you were going to throw out market cap loss, you don't get to start counting exchange volume because it favors your narrative. Bitcoin has lost significant percentage of the total market of exchange volume regardless, so I guess it wouldn't really prove your point either.

Bch does hard forks because its democratic, we can make changes through soft forks and force everyone to update too.

"Hey guys and gals, I wrote this as a post, but it got buried:

The Hedera Hashgraph technology has remained on the fringes of the cryptosphere for quite some time, but they are now headed for the mainstream.

Funded by big investors, they are aiming big, all the while r/cryptocurrency hasn't paid much attention to it yet - how could we possibly care about a project that has not had an ICO? (!) üò∂

The underlying technology, as I've understood it, is a fully Byzantine fault tolerant, extremely efficient version of the tangle. Through my laymans lenses, the technology does seem like the work of genius. 

It can potentially become the new ""trust layer of the internet"", aka internets missing standardisation. Fully Byzantine fault tolerant, and with transactions exceeding 200 000 per second, it does strike me as a huge step forward in crypto. 

TLDR: Potentially very powerful stuff.

The only problem is: 

They don't want to open source it, and it will not be permission-less. 
The governance model consists of a handful of companies and organizations (39) that will basically control the whole system, and receive 10% of the profit generated from the consensus mechanism (I haven't understood it yet, but it seems like there will be a transaction fee, at least on some types of transactions).

The Hedera team defends this by claiming that the governing ""council"" will be changed after a set amount of years, but imo this is still a governing model that basically creates an oligarchy. 

The council will choose to elect any new member they want to the council, so I suspect it will just be a big oligarchic business club. 

As there is a chance this technology will play a big role in the coming decades of technology acceleration, I think the crypto community needs to start a discussion on it. 

Do we want a potentially revolutionary technology governed by big business? 

Does any one have any knowledge about the project that I have over looked?

"You do know that the block chain is just digital data that can be copied, right? Every node makes a copy of the blockchain and every block contains a reference to the previous block. On the Bitcoin cash blockchain, this chain of references goes all the way back to the Genesis block, which is the same as that on Bitcoin core.",1525524579
"I guess the reason why Bitcoin Core supporters are going nuts about this is because all BTC have left today is the name 'Bitcoin' itself. 

If BTC has the superior tech, they wouldn't be so paranoid or throwing such a hissy\-fit about BCH using the Bitcoin name as the coin with the superior tech always wins out in the end.

Moreover, technically, the coin with the most code changes should be the fork, not the other way around. With SegWit and other mutations coded into it, BTC is no longer the bitcoin that Satoshi envisioned in his whitepaper.",1525524531

"Did you want to use transaction rate for a given period of time? Total value being transacted for a given period of time? New wallet address appearances on the network? Mining reward as a measure of security of the network?

&amp;nbsp;

A large number of different metrics you could use to measure adoption, use, growth are all indicating Bitcoin has *definitively suffered* from it's transaction backlog issues that were experienced last year. Seeing their loss of the total market cap share is one of the more noticeable ones, especially for those that argued for maximalism in the past. Stating that single metric is fallacious doesn't dispel the mass of other metrics that are all indicating the same story: transaction backlog has already damaged Bitcoin, and will absolutely continue to do so",1525524475
"I'll get down voted for this but I'm one of those people that want thorough regulations on crypto. As long as there are ways to hide in this space, it will be impossible to strive for mainstream adoption. Like it or not, the gov't plays a role in international finances and need a way to ensure that people aren't using crypto for money laundering or scamming others. And yes, there is the tax issue.

"Bitcoin is BTC. Every exchange I've ever seen lists Bitcoin as BTC. Bitcoin core is not a crypto currency, it's the piece of software used for Bitcoin.

"There is no haste in moving the BCH from the old wallet, but it is no point in not doing it either. For that you need a bch-compatible wallet, for example Electron Cash for the PC or bitcoin.com wallet for your phone.

Monero is just not interesting in today's crypto world. Money is flowing elsewhere.,1525524254
"I don't see your point, to be honest. People didn't like the way btc was going so they forked. So what? Forks are still bitcoin. Otherwise btc isn't bitcoin because it forked too.

To put it another way, let's say hypothetically that bch shoots up to $10,000 tomorrow, overtaking btc in market cap. Will you still think it's not bitcoin? Or, to take it farther, what if btc dies out entirely the day after that? Will you still think bch isn't bitcoin then?

Or to put it a third way, how do you define the word bitcoin? To make your point, you'll have to come up with a definition that excludes bch but includes btc. But most of those definitions are fairly arbitrary and connected to market cap (eg btc only has the most proof of work because it currently has a higher market cap).",1525524240

"I do not think this type of explanation is even necessary.

In order to spend money, you need to have some. If you have some fiat to spend, then it means you have not bought Bitcoin Cash with it. If you kept fiat in order to spend in the future and the price of Bitcoin Cash goes up in the meantime, why do you not have any regrets then? It is obviously psychological.

By keeping your wealth in fiat, you suffered relative inflation until the moment of spending, which you would not have if you had initially held the deflationary asset. If there is a deflationary asset that has no barriers to spending, it would have been better to get rid of your fiat immediately.

All in all, the principle of not spending a deflationary asset is irrational. Keeping your wealth in a deflationary asset and spending it makes you wealthier.

This is of course, assuming fiat inflates relative to Bitcoin. If not, then the initial behavior has no justification to begin with.

"https://antonopoulos.com/statement-on-mt-gox/

Yes, sure he did. He concluded it was run incompetently, and he was right.

But Ver's video isn't about that. It's about letting people know that he saw the fiat bank accounts of MtGox and that they had the balances that they claimed. No more, no less. And history shows that (at that time) they did. They just didn't have the BTC, which was even more disasterous!

Framing it 4 years later as something else is just wrong.",1525523732
"It's actually very difficult to obtain a patent for crypto-related inventions because two of the exclusions to patentability are computer programs and methods of business. Also open-source projects usually have clauses in them which mean that any improvements made to their code is also open-source - so you'd have to build your invention yourself from the ground up, then prove that it's not purely a method of business on a computer.

Of course this is still doable, and it is being done - IBM has loads of blockchain patents already, but it's not as simple as throwing a bunch of money at it. Even massive tech companies and banks have to work within the legal framework.",1525523703

"I‚Äôm a crypto supporter.  And bitcoin‚Äôs attitude is bad for crypto. You‚Äôre not the king anymore because your community refuses to take the steps to get bitcoin adopted. No effort to partner. No leadership. Constant infighting over direction. Failed forks. Network issues. 

Bitcoin has a 5 year lead on most coins, and that lead is narrowing as other coins develop far superior tech and make partnerships to make crypto household. ",1525523675
"That's correct because when BCH forked they were the minority so they changed the protocol slightly to ensure everyone knew to which chain people were sending transactions. But since the chain forked they both have the same cumulative difficulty until the fork, and so far BTC has the majority of the difficulty, however this could change in the future, and if/when that happens BCH might become Bitcoin, until then it's Bitcoin Cash.",1525523671
"I subscribe to /r/btc to read about new developments in Bitcoin Cash, adoption stories, etc. but about 75% of posts are whiny bitches complaining about Bitcoin Core. It‚Äôs really disheartening and if anything it likely turns people off from Bitcoin Cash.

Please stop this self destructive crap.",1525523670
Being in BCH is great right now. It‚Äôs moving with BTC but the ratio keeps increasing ,1525523603
"Yea I have no doubt about that. I‚Äôm just talking about being open to the fact that words, acronyms, and language in general are not static. But apparently people feel very strongly about it being a typo and this typo is excluded from being used in any other form despite its prevalence in ‚Äòbitcoin culture.‚Äô  

In the end, we didn‚Äôt realize it was such a serious offense, and we‚Äôre sorry. ",1525523590
"You said, that BCH doesn't have scaling ceiling \- it surely has and if you quoted Satoshi, it is from the early days, where the network didn't have a limited block size or from days where block size limit change was very simple, not like nowadays.

Your original comment about ""describing"" both chains just doesn't make sense \- There were users that wanted to create a fork from Bitcoin, so it is 100&amp;#37; understandable that it has to have a different name and not try to steal it from the original \(don't mention me that BCH is the original, plz\).

In the end please understand, that Bitcoin is nothing more than just a name and should not be changed. BCH is the one who changed, so the name should be different as well. This is ""a man is yelling at a cloud"" attitude. If the name should change, a lot of unnecessary confusion would pop up just because some idiots are spreading""BCH da real Bitcoin.""",1525523566
"He should pick a different name for his shitcoin and not bitcoin cash, probably a\*s cash , he is just doing a scam work, but soon is over ;\)",1525523510
"Because fraud has to be reported. If everyone ignore or takes a passive stance towards such problems, there will be a proliferation of fraudsters, which will cause a tremendous amount of confusion towards the new comers, which will cause harm to the crypto community overall.",1525523505
"&gt; For example running a ponzi in crypto is illegal without any additional regulations.

Yes, because it's illegal to defraud someone. It doesn't take 20 new regulations about Ponzi schemes. 

&gt;Just because crime happens is not an excuse to stop fighting the crime. 

Nobody said anything about stopping the fight against crime. I'm saying there are ways to more effectively do it. When it's done in an overly inefficient way more harm can be done than good. Why more harm? It's because the legitimate projects get squashed out in the process, opening the field wider for the good sounding scams.

&gt;people still get lured and still get surprised after their favorite get rich quick schemes collapse. 

Like I said, you get that with or without regulation because markets will always exist and a market demand will always be met with supply. There is constant demand from people to be given money for basically nothing. That's not how the world works, but it's how people want it to work, so they don't heed advice of others and the time tested dictum of ""if it sounds too good to be true...""

&gt;The issue is many aspects of crypto aren't subjected to any ovesight whatsoever but they progressively will be

And if so it will likely do more harm than good by killing off the legitimate projects opening the door wider for the scams.

&gt;In other words the longer freemarket screws people

It's not the free market that screws people. I have news for you. It's the free market that helps prevent a bad situation becoming worse. People getting screwed happens either way, as I said because they seek what isn't possible, something for nothing.  ",1525523495

""I am banned from posting in /r/Bitcoin"" ... accidentally posts to /r/Bitcoin ... ""Oops. Now I'll pretend like I never claimed to be banned from /r/Bitcoin, and ignore anyone who asks me about that claim.""

""I've dumped a few hundred BTC for BCC""... 2 weeks later: ""I haven't sold a single Bitcoin for Bitcoin Cash up until yesterday""

He lies about the subreddit he controls. He regularly lies about his holdings. He lied and scammed his way into the bitcoin.com domain, which he uses to push out FUD about Bitcoin and its developers. He lies on agreements he signs (e.g. ""the bitcoin.com pool will mine with NYA/btc1/2x code... whoops just kidding, we're mining bcash instead""). He even had the audacity to lie about what happened in court, when there is a public transcript available which disproves everything he said.

There are more examples of blatant deception that I don't have the time or patience to dig up right now. Make no mistake: the man is, unfortunately, a sociopath.

"I don't really understand the last quarter. What do u mean not complicated enough?u mean not trying to intentionally confusing u? u mean not dysfunctional? not shady? u mean doesn't have a lot of applications? is not constantly upgrading and improving?

Why would a consultant work on BCH? well idk maybe because all the intended functions that were \*\*\*\*ed in BTC are working again? so like maybe u can use it like an actual currency to buy and sell? Tell me what does Bitcoin ""do"" now aside from being a speculative currency.  

And, yes, it's true a business interested in payment processing needs a payment processing service, HOWEVER u do NOT need a payment processing service to buy/sell directly with BCH. You only need a payment processor if u want to accept credit cards and other physical payment methods \(or management automation\) in which case there are some very reliable ones. Now in order to reach this conclusion as a business new to the crypto u probably will need a consultant.

 So why are ""consultants"" are ignoring BCH and promoting BTC? simply because: one, BTC have been here the longest and is the 1st crypto \(inherent undeniable advantage\) . Most have not caught up with how pathetic the state BTC is in for a while now and how it's not so hard to get it useful again. Two, BTC is backed by big monies. Big monies that were able to buy a world level developer team and change their function completely, that were able to control info across international platforms to censor and alter perception of reality, that is and still paying non advertisers and popular figures not to ""promote"" but change their ""thoughts"" and aggressively deny reality.

BCH is functional, have a decent\(actually working to make the crypto better not worse\) developer team, have a lot of key figures, active, passionate and realistic community, rising usage and adoption, increasing business applications, preparing for the future and adding NEW functionalities \(akin to ETH\) as time goes by.

The developers, in this case, are not responsible for the marketing. They are mainly responsible for the well functioning of BCH. BCH marketing is mostly done by the PEOPLE, pretty much individual efforts. The 32 MB is really good now because things are exponentially getting tested, spread, used then embraced. Good developers prepare for the future BEFORE it comes.

As for adoption, the limiting factor here is mainly time. You can't just shove BCH up everyone's throat. But as u surely can see progress is made and not showing any declining momentum. As for specific techniques that really depends on the situation and will depend a lot on ur personal short term goals.

Sorry for the long rant. But this is a sample of the perspective of a non professional member of the crypto community.",1525522468
"I actually think BCH are in the right here, you can clearly tell that BTC is trying to silence Ver. But I agree that block sizes should‚Äôve been increased. At the very least Segwit2x could‚Äôve been a happy medium. Ver‚Äôs only losing point for me is his constant need to call his version Bitcoin. Just change the name and start working off it‚Äôs merits. Promote the coin with how fast it is compared to current Bitcoin. Actually now that I typed that out. No one on this community would even support ‚Äúfaster Bitcoin‚Äù altcoin because there are already so many coins that are faster with bigger blocks etc that people don‚Äôt support. 

Hmmm 
",1525522423
"One thing I learned putting money into crypto is ""don't try to be too clever"", it always bites you because the market is made up of ""unclever"" and irrational people. Things move completely unexpectedly.

Also, while I'm very skeptical about all the new things coming for Ethereum (like PoS and Sharding), if they DO work out, I think that would mean great things. But again, these are really whole new fields of their own. I believe successfully implementing PoS, sharding, etc. on top of Ethereum will be as challenging a task as inventing Ethereum itself (actually more challenging)

That said, I'm quickly warming up to BCH. It's been a while I've ever touched Solidity and Web3.js because lately I've been mostly looking into Bitcoin script.",1525522398

"Because I don‚Äôt support the underhanded tactics used to boost bitcoin segwit to where it is today. They‚Äôve done everything they can to suppress dissent from their unproven off chain experiment and delayed global adoption, manipulating their way to the top.  I‚Äôm assuming you don‚Äôt understand just how bad central banks are for the world.  The whole point of bitcoin was to undermine them and render them obsolete. If banks are investing in blockstream, that should give you a clue as to how effective bitcoin will be at doing so.  It‚Äôs been utterly compromised and corrupted, that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt support it.

"BTC benefits:

Longest PoW chain (i.e. consensus from miners about it's legitimacy).

Non-malleable transactions if using Segwit.

BCH benefits:

Witness data is still where it always has been (i.e. less prone to new bugs).

Largest block size.",1525522169
Do you think as the price goes higher it will be more difficult for the unbanned community's to replace? I'm my mind this is why BTC now pushes the store of value angle.,1525522153
I think you need to research what segwit actually did to the BTC chain. Seeing as it is irreversible I think it's best you just research what you'll be stuck with forever and why it's garbage. ,1525522098
It‚Äôs not the new meaning. It just shows you‚Äôre late to Bitcoin. If you want to make money print t shirts with the original bitcointalk forum thread on it with the hodling typo. I‚Äôd pay Bitcoin for one of those. ,1525522084
What the fuck. That's not how any of this works. Not one crypto doubles in value just because bitcoin does. If someone thinks that 1 xyz is worth 1btc that's roughly 9000usd today. If btc price doubles in 6 months you really think people just say fuck it I guess I should pay 18000usd for xyz now. Of course not!,1525522079
"You want to be looking at Log base 2. Look at tops and bottoms on Log 2 for the full history of BTC. And yes - we will have another dip somewhere in 3rd quarter, possibly double dip down to 6k levels, but we should get a new ATH this year. After that, first target somewhere in 2019 / 2020 should be around 65k. When comparing this correction against April 2013 and Early 2014, the fact that the recent low was higher than the low in Feburary is a major indicator that Feb was bottom. In 2014 correction, each low was lower than the last. This also has a significant effect on momentum indicators which is what drives BTC and every alt. It's the same momentum indicators that result in a parabolic occurring - and yes - there should be another parabolic on BTC in about 3 and a bit years.Not convinced we'll get one sooner, but it's possible - too early to tell at this stage, but not impossible we see another one. When all momentum indicators go positive - that's when the fun begins :)",1525522050

"I gave up reading his obnoxious ""tweetstorm"" along the way. Was it like thousand tweets? I stopped counting. The Tweetstorm feature is the worst feature Twitter has ever ""invented"", just lets you ramble on and on and on and ...

Anyway, like Chris pointed out, the one thing that stands out from this guy's mindset is characterized by the following statement:

&gt; Bitcoin is one of the greatest financial opportunities in human history. If anyone interested in wealth &amp; misses it/fucks up w/ it, qualifies as stupid. I get from your other tweets that you're not interested in wealth (I am), so at least this point doesn't really concern you.

First, this is the most disgusting thing I've heard and I can now understand why most people who are mindlessly believing in BTC behave in such a way.

They see it as a ""one of the greatest financial opportunities in human history"", but it's important to note that he's not talking about ""opportunity for the humanity"", he's talking about his own opportunity. He might as well say Bitcoin is ""one of the greatest get-rich-quick scheme in human history"".

Personally it's disgusting he's even using the adjective ""human"" in ""human history"", just making it sound like it's some grand scheme when he's really only talking about his greedy self.

Second, he thinks this ""opportunity"" can be ""missed"" or ""fucked up"" because, again, he sees this as his own ""get rich quick scheme"". However anyone who sees Bitcoin as a true ""greatest opportunity in human history"" to advance humanity WILL NEVER think this way.

It is great if you get rich by investing in what you believe in, and that's what I did too. If Bitcoin collapses it would hurt A LOT, but I personally think if that's what it takes to succeed, BE IT. 

This ""opportunity"" is not something that can be ""fucked up"" in the grand scheme of things--as in humanity's point of view--because the parndora's box has been open. Now people know that something like this is even possible at all. You can't put it back. Here's what will happen:

If Bitcoin or Bitcoin cash fails (or any other Crypto really), people will learn from the experience why something failed. Then they will RETRY.

Remember Dot-com bubble? It popped. Hard. And then came Google, Facebook, and Twitter. I'm not saying that's what will exactly happen, but my point is, no matter how hard you try, and no matter how perfect you think your system is, there always be a crack that can send it down the drain.

Lastly, while it would definitely hurt if BTC or BCH crashes, I think it's good to try everything possible to find out what works as quickly as possible. I'm more interested in huge opportunities that arise AS A RESULT of Bitcoin's adoption than the money I'll make by having invested in it. Thinking of Bitcoin as speculative investment vehicle ONLY is the most pathetic thing anyone in crypto could think of, like this Giacomo guy.

The only reason one would think this way is because all they think about is getting rich without doing anything significant, or because they can't see all kinds of opportunities that will arise because of Bitcoin.

This actually characterizes most of these high priest people on the BTC side compared to BCH. While BCH is busy building all kinds of services like memo.cash or blockpress on BCH, and trying to work hard to support merchants and get actual adoption, all BTC people are doing is trying their best to keep control over their users by limiting every single feature of Bitcoin (like corrupt monarchy), trolling and disseminating memes on Twitter/Reddit (to keep the propaganda flowing to distract their ""citizens""), and...what else? Preaching after Blockstream and Lightning like some cult members? Other than that I can't find any. It's pathetic. 

They just want to ""get rich quick"" without actually putting in work, and they think they deserve it just because they got lucky by making some irrational betting decision early on (I did make this ""irrational investment"" early on too, but I am very aware it was irrational and I never look down on other ""normies"" as if they're stupid idiots. I am very well aware I was lucky enough to educate myself early on and made a bet, and it paid off).

Basically, here's the summary:

1. BTC maximalists care only about themselves making money, and not so much about the impact Bitcoin will bring. After all, who cares about ""world change"" or ""advance of the humanity"", when they're already rich? They'll probably use up their money to party all the way to death.
2. BCH believers care about Bitcoin as a way to bring change to the world order, sure it will be great to make money along the way, but what they really see is the huge opportunity it will bring as a result. Even if you don't make tons of money from BCH, as long as you're educated about Bitcoin when Bitcoin succeeds, you WILL see tons of opportunities you can capitalize on to make tons of money.

I really think even the people on the ""purely BCH"" side should try to understand why BTC people think BTC will win. In my case it's still 50/50. I do see the point in BTC's logic (just disgusted about the motivation) as much as I see BCH's logic. And understanding this helps you make rational decisions (unlike this Giacomo guy)",1525521957
"Because it is a minority fork of Bitcoin that wants to rebrand itself as ""the real Bitcoin"" and invented a new name for Bitcoin called ""bitcoin core"". 

When it forked, Bitcoin kept the majority of users and miners. That means it kept the original work containing the genesis block. BCH is the fork that copied everything up until the fork. That is how consensus works. 

Antpool and Rodger Ver commit open fraud to peddle Bitcoin Cash to noobs as Bitcoin. It is not. End of story. ",1525521953

That's not how the market works. It might not be traded against USD, but all investors value projects in usd terms. If bitcoin doubles in 24 hours today, during that time frame altcoins will slowly dump against btc to keep their USD value. They'll be about half the satoshi value by the end of that 24 hours.

"Yes. People get hurt by scams in real life all the time too. The difference is when you scam in real life there is a higher possibility of real consequences. More regulations isn't necessarily needed but some are and some are already in place. For example running a ponzi in crypto is illegal without any additional regulations. Just because crime happens is not an excuse to stop fighting the crime. 


Unfortunately crypto scams are a bit different. When scammers hide behind anonymity and take the tokens out of unsophisticated folks and run the best thing you can do is say SFYL to them afterwards.

Another good example is Davorcoin. We knew it was a scam from day 1 and people still poured into it after being burned by bitconnect. Even though lending platforms are basically a synonymous of scam people still get lured and still get surprised after their favorite get rich quick schemes collapse. 


The issue is many aspects of crypto aren't subjected to any ovesight whatsoever but they progressively will be, especially when more people will get burned by various schemes and issues. This is frankly to be expected. Conventional knowledge is that the government stepping in while the illegitimate investment schemes are in the middle of their development is a bad idea because if the scheme collapses or gets shut down due to government asking hard questions the suckers will often blame the government for the intervention even if it was necessary and timely. There were times when such actions even led to social unrest Thus some regulatory bodies assume the stance in which they go in for the kill right after the schemes collapse which earns them free positive PR and grants more legitimacy to their further actions and decisions. I assume this is why some goverments are reasonably cautious and some regulatory agencies move very slowly and adapt soft approach for now to not upset the balance yet. They can always apply hardcore regulations after lots of people get burned and start crying about the fraud.

 In other words the longer freemarket screws people and the community does hardly anything about it the more excuses regulators will have later, this is how it worked before.

Once a good dex or two come out BTC won't be valued as much as something that can preform 70% more transactions and that amount of transactions is still not enough for the the worlds daily volume(Your daily purchases). Since I began in Crypto I never really used BTC due to waiting around for 3 hours for a transaction and then on top of that waiting for the exchange to show I have funds. You're just better off using Eth or something more reliable because in the end this market is volatile and time is the most valuable to me so why use BTC? In my opinion the coin that will rule them all is a coin that can handle the volume of a DEX because fuck centralized exchanges they are the death of all of us no matter how good it is.

Calling either branch of the fork ""Bitcoin"" right now is simply less accurate. All other alternatives would likely be more offensive to those who choose to frequent /r/Bitcoin. Personally, I think Bitcoin (SegWit) is fine, or Blockstream Bitcoin. Bitcoin (store-of-value) would work as well.

By the time I was able to look into DASH it had grown much larger legs, many exchanges listed it and there were fewer voices of warning which could be heard, fewer mostly because they got painted with red negative trust tags on Bitcointalk by Dash supporters.

From the perspective of leadership, there is zero interest in bitcoin. None. I'm paraphrasing but last year, the CEO stated something along the lines of ""We will never work with it."" He clarified to say that that's not to suggest there is no value in bitcoin and its clones but we will not put any efforts towards it. Conversations around Monero pop up here and there and from a technical perspective, it's interesting to a lot of our devs but as you can imagine, XMR sort of flies in the face of the regulatory burdens brought on by AML and KYC.

"I'm going to copy a post I made somewhere else in this thread that should help answer your question.

I'll try and keep this very simple and it's early so I might make some mistakes. I'm going to use simple and round numbers and this doesn't reflect how the market trades.

In this example we're going to say futures price for Bitcoin is $1000. Say you enter a short position for 1 Bitcoin. You will not need to put up the full $1000 to enter the contract. Both sides will set up a margin account with an exchange to cover price swings. In this case we'll say that the initial margin requirement is 10% so to enter the contract both sides would need to put up $100.

At start: long position $100, short position $100

A week later bitcoins price changes to $1010. The exchange will move $10 from the short position's margin account and move it to the long. 

After week one: long $110, short $90

The next week bitcoins price drops to $910. $100 would be moved from the long positions account and moved into the short.

After week two: long $10, short $190

At this point, the exchange would make a margin call because if the price were to go down even more the long position might not be able to cover the price change with their remaining money, the long position would have to put another $90 into the account to get back to the initial margin requirement.

After margin call: long $100, short $190

When a position is liquidated, a price has swung so much that the exchange is concerned that one of the positions will not be able to make these margin calls in the future any more. As a result, they will force the position that is losing money to pay the contract in full at the current price to prevent them from being exposed to any more price swings.

Edit: These numbers do not reflect how an actual Bitcoin contract works. Since they are a crazy volitile asset, initial margins range from 35% to 44% depending on the exchange.

Happened as a result of the agreements and then shitting on them.

Xthin tech makes this not a problem (especially when Graphene comes out which is an order of magnitude bettwr). Xthin was taken by Core and implemented as compact blocks

&gt;""Congestion"" concerns can be solved with mempool improvements including transaction eviction

That isn't the comcern. The concern is rapidly increasing fees ehich makes the txs become stuck and make for a shitty overall experience.

&gt;No amount of max block size would support all the world's future transactions on the main blockchain

Yes. And? Allow the 1st layer to increase to its limit. BTW neither can L2 'solutions' because they are constrained by L1. LN devs say there must be at least 133mb blocks for it to work.

&gt;Fast block propagation is either not clearly viable, or creates centralized controls

Absolutely not, see Graphene above.

&gt;Larger blocks make full nodes more expensive to operate

True. Just like it is more expensive to have a modern computer than an arduino. My cell phone can handle significantly larger blocks on a data connection.

&gt;Larger blocks lead to fewer hashers running full nodes, which leads to centralized entities having more power, which makes Bitcoin require more trust, which weakens Bitcoin's value proposition

No. There are objectively more mining entities today then ever before. Pools allow smaller miners to easily 'pool' their hashing power and compete with the largest of miners. The pool is the one responsible for other resources.

&gt;The larger the hash-rate a single miner controls, the more centralized Bitcoin becomes and the more trust using Bitcoin requires

I have no idea what this has to do with bigger blocks (unless it's the continuation of the above)

Your posts are just moving the goalposts and you seem confused how open source tech and development works. You are now using examples comparing it to protected trademarks, which shows your lack of understanding.    
Ver has every right to say BCH is closer to the original vision than BTC, and that it makes it the real Bitcoin whilst BTC is usurped by banks and corporations. It may not be true, there are rebuttals against that, but claiming it does not make it a scam as you say. BCH is not being marketed. You say things like this: ""Since it's name, it was misleading"". Is linux Ubuntu/Mint/Fedora/ take your pick the scam OS then? Don;t move the goalposts by saying its something else that makes BCH a scam and not that. You specifically mention that, so explore that point logically.    
Or is it this, your concluding statement   
&gt;It's not that you, Bob, or a community made it a scam, it's that the group of developers and literally copied/pasted (And still continues) the code from Bitcoin Core source code (BCH gets updates about a day after, with the same code changes, because Bitcoin ABC literally just copies the code line for line, and you can compare Bitcoin Core to Bitcoin ABC client)       


You know what Litecoin is, right? BCH is following a different path to BTC and they are very vocal about that. It is not just a copy and paste with a different name as you say. Don't fall for the bullshit being thrown around by either side of these debates. There are lowest common denominator types on both sides which will use the basest accusations and slanders to try and prove their points.   
   
If you ask me, R.Ver is someone who will bend rules to help what he sees as the real BTC succeed. He is not a scammer, but sometimes his actions cross lines and innocent people get put at risk (being mislead by his name change on bitcoin.com for example). He is not without fault.

"I'll try and keep this very simple and it's early so I might make some mistakes. I'm going to use simple and round numbers and this doesn't reflect how the market trades.

In this example we're going to say futures price for Bitcoin is $1000. Say you enter a short position for 1 Bitcoin. You will not need to put up the full $1000 to enter the contract. Both sides will set up a margin account with an exchange to cover price swings. In this case we'll say that the initial margin requirement is 10% so to enter the contract both sides would need to put up $100.

At start: long position $100, short position $100


A week later bitcoins price changes to $1010. The exchange will move $10 from the short position's margin account and move it to the long. 

After week one: long $110, short $90

The next week bitcoins price drops to $910. $100 would be moved from the long positions account and moved into the short.

After week two: long $10, short $190

At this point, the exchange would make a margin call because if the price were to go down even more the long position might not be able to cover the price change with their remaining money, the long position would have to put another $90 into the account to get back to the initial margin requirement.

After margin call: long $100, short $190

When a position is liquidated, a price has swung so much that the exchange is concerned that one of the positions will not be able to make these margin calls in the future any more. As a result, they will force the position that is losing money to pay the contract in full at the current price to prevent them from being exposed to any more price swings.",1525518388

There revenue last year was $4 billion and they have been mining a quarter if not more of all bitcoins for years. They have all the money they need to pump the price of bcash. Another thing they do is burn bcash coins to decrease the supply and push up the prices through deflation.

No money or actual Bitcoin is being lent at the start of the contract date. Initial margins are put into an account by both parties to cover price swings.

In most cases when a futures contract would end, the short position would need to deliver the stock or commodity to the long position. With Bitcoin futures, they must pay the long position in the equivalent amount of cash. Neither position needed to hold any Bitcoin for the contract to work, they just both needed enough money to meet margin requirements.",1525517352

"the thing is the parents and grandparents of this world are the ones in power, in politics and in the economy in general, they are also a much bigger number of people than the young people.

crypto doesnt give you any more control over your money, in the end all you have are some number, bit and byte just like you have it on your bank account, you still have to pay taxes and you still have to pay fees depending on the crypto you use.

for the average transaction cryptos currently have zero benefits even if they would be equal to a legal tender they would at best be equal to it in terms of benefits because there will be no cournty in the world making a crypto a legal tender without heavily regulating it.

but to sum up what you are saying, basically cryptos should be harder to use to keep the average person out?

"I guess I will follow up a little. Guess I will do the work for you, since I actually feel somewhat bad for my own investment, since it's all EOS we see in the subreddit and never Cardano, that's because Cardano is not a marketing train. 


If that's something you like, if you want a project to actually have good coders, good devs, a good team, then Cardano could be something for you. It is not Vechain or EOS chasing partnerships. It's a scientific approach to Blockchain, and that takes time. Nethertheless, advancements are there. 


So when you look at their team, the big is is obviously Charles. Charles was Co-Founder of Ethereum, which is of course a plus. He's shown to be capable of doing these things and is potentially one of the biggest people in Crypto at this moment, simply by having been part of the Ethereum achievement. 


You have a University network around the globe, working with you and reading your whitepaper analysis on competitors and also on your own stuff. Cardano in that regard is very mixy. They're not afraid to say some project did this or that really good and maybe add elements of that to their own. They're not copycats, like TRON are, but they value good ideas. 

Then you have amazing devs. Some projects don't even seem to have devs, when you see billion dollar cryptos not even having their own wallet, that's a somewhat of a red flag. 


____ 

The concern, but also at the same time somewhat a good thing, is Cardano take their time. They're not spitting marketing, nor are they rushing into their new chain. They're working, but take their time to make sure they don't fuck up something in the process. 


The critique, even from their own investors sometimes, is that it could simply all be too slow, which I personally find to be a stupid argument, since the usecase for such utility tokens is almost not even existing yet, so what's the point in releasing a platform early, when nobody really uses it right now anyways. 

____ 


https://cardanoroadmap.com/


That's the stuff they want to implement and you can roughly see how far they're with that. However, these percentages sadly do not imply when actual release can be predicted. 




Whether or not their coding will replace anything, or whether their platform will turn out as the most useful, remains to be seen obviously. 

 

Nobody fucking knows whether what they're ultimately building is pure air, or something we all will eventually benefit from. We don't know. Ethereum has hardly any use for example, yet 5-6 competitors emerged. Speculative stuff really, because Bitcoin still works well for most people. 


Since you're not a coder, it's really hard to justify any of the magic they're doing. It could just all be vaporware, we don't know. 


However, if you believe that the Co-Founder of Ethereum is unlikely to work hard for years, on something that's ultimately useless, is your decision.

__


Personally believe that if there's a competitor to Ethereum, it's Cardano. Since it's a project almost free of hype, I like them a lot for that alone. I like them, because they're not spammed on Reddit every single day. Charles is amazing, maybe you should check out of his talks. 


The valuation you see is mostly from the celeb dev team if anything. Whilst marketing is not strong in Cardano, people are not stupid and see the team of Cardano and assume they're going to be successful.



I am as sceptical, as I am exicited, really. If there's a utility newcomer I'd invest it, it would be them. *Would be* is a stupid work, I did invest, just right now I don't own any, because Bitcoin is close to 10k and I predict short-term Bitcoin winning. I will repurchase my bags once I think that's over. 


Essentially, in a few words, it's a marketing free project, full with people with crazy credentials, with admirable goals to innovate in the Blockchain space. 


Like all utility tokens, it could just all turn out to be not more than air. But that goes for all of them. ",1525515784

I can see lots of people using XMR instead of cash, such as P2P trades (vehicles for example) where you wouldn't want the other party knowing how much you have after the transaction has occurred.

"&gt;Any Bitcoin fork is a legimate contender for the Bitcoin name.

The downvote brigade will be here, but imo that is flawed allready. Bitcoin was supposed to be technically and socially hard to get concensus on improvements. Whether that has been by a smear campaign or not, anything that doesn't go by consensus and thus forking off has a *minority* right to to bitcoin name. The whole beauty of being opensource is that it can fork once such smear campaigns succeed, but that doesn't mean any fork should have a legit claim to the name, I definitely disagree with ""by default, it's competition for the ownership of the name"". Now here is where free market gets both great but also the most frustrating thing. You claim concensus outside of the nodes is what makes a claim to the name legit, but in pretty much every metric Bitcoin is still king, so by that would that mean we can only claim Bitcoin once those metrics change? The frustrating thing is also ""any"" project can have a claim then, since it's a free market anyways. What if Ethereum claims the bitcoin name and becomes the biggest chain? Free market renders the genesis block or longest chain or whatever argument invalid.  Since it's free market, nothing can stop them from doing so. 

&gt;If you have even the most basic understanding of how a free market works with an open source consensus-based project that has forked, the *name* is the entire focus / purpose / reason for the fork in the first place.  So by definition it can‚Äôt be dishonest.

No, the name is in 99% of the cases not the purpose of forking and also it doesn't imply it is always honest. Again, the free market argument can work against it, if you choose these free market mechanics are honest by definition you pretty much say anything around it can't be dishonest either, including censorship and trash talking. Also, marketing fits the frustrating bill here as well, since many coins out there are based on marketing, not tech. What if on of these catch a larger marketcap and claim the name? People are stupid and will buy into it. Exactly why ""the next Bitcoin"" is so often used as a sales pitch. 

I don't even understand why this is an issue in the first place, I think Bitcoin Cash is a decent name (although I advocated for Bitcoin Classic) first. It's implying a focus on what Bitcoin itself has moved away from. It's not insulting, it's a name to imply a version of bitcoin it isn't anymore. My take on it is that either we differentiate or we become a testbed for BTC like LTC is right now. Who is there to say an overtake is certain?, maybe big blocks turn out to be right and BTC just implements it as they see it works better. I fine in calling BCH just Bitcoin if by any chance BTC dies out, but the reality is that is very unlikely and until then I call them both by the names they have now and nothing else. 

TLDR; 

Consensus now is BTC=Bitcoin and BCH=Bitcoin Cash. Free market lets you call them whatever you like, but that same free market is working against you if choose to do so.",1525513839

In any case the BTC community spilt does not give Roger Ver the right to create confusion and attempt to assimilate the Bitcoin name and merge BCH into being the Bitcoin, its ludicrous. 

Yes, I do think most of the people I mentioned are in it for the money, some have other intentions.

Ver started this one sided battle, the major voices within Bitcoin and Blockstream are by and large silent.

"So the popcorn company has many other use cases,  

check out some of the other partnerships announced for a product only in its beta,  https://medium.com/market-protocol

Traders, miners, stakers / masternodes all could benefit from hedging the price of a token without moving it back to an exchange dealing with the security concerns/fees.  As to be able to consume the utility.

Utility tokens.
¬†A utility token can be defined ‚Äúto represent future access to a company‚Äôs product or service‚Äù

An example of a utility token is the Basic Attention Token (BAT). the BAT token functions as a medium exchange between users, advertisers, and publishers who participate in the Brave browser ecosystem. Advertisers purchase ads using BAT tokens, which are then distributed among both publishers and browser users as compensation for hosting the ads and viewing them, respectively.¬†  Advertisers would need to be able to decouple themselves from the price of BAT to consume the utility of the attention economy,  thats where MARKET Protocol smart contract would come into play.  Dow Jones Media would be able to determine the price that a derivative contract would settle for x amount of time into the future until they are done running their marketing campaigns.

 Siacoin main purpose is to account the use of data storage.  A company that has offices around the world and has plans to use SC decentralized cloud storage for x period of time, can make a derivative contract on the ETH blockchain using any ERC20 token to have fixed exposure to SC and consume the utility of data storage.  This is why we feel as though MARKET Protocol will be an essential part of the crypto ecosystem,  because it allows the space to evolve where the 90% drop or rise in the price of SC has no bearing on the business owner who‚Äôs main aim is to use data storage.   Imagine you needed to hedge your Siacoin that you own as a business to consume their platform, if you have to lock them, you cannot use them, so hedging is pointless.  But with our MARKET protocol, you would lock collateral (either a stable coin or maybe ETH) and hedge your SC that way.  So you have now decoupled price from utility.  Which is what an airline does with their exposure to fuel prices (for example). and is a very important feature of derivatives in the business world.

Stores use NCASH tokens to incentives more frequent visits, increase in store purchases, and increase brand loyalty/retention. Nucleus‚Äôs retail partners obtain NCASH tokens and reward customers, those customers can use the tokens across the Nucleus ecosystem or exchange them for real cash. The customer can earn additional NCASH tokens for giving data to the merchants.  These sum up the utility of what NCASH provides to merchants.  The truth is that brick and mortar retailers need this tech to be able to stay competitive with their ecommerce counterparts,  but those merchants would need to be able to decouple the price of NCASH to have a fixed annual budget and to ensure the cost of the token doesn‚Äôt exceed the utility associated with owning the token.  If a retailer plans to take advantage of the the benefits of NCASH for lets say hypothetically a 5 year contract,  it would bode them to know exactly what the tokens they will be purchasing would cost,  well as we know there is plenty of volatility in crypto. MARKET Protocol allows merchants the ability to hedge the price risk associated with owning the token, while maintaining custody of NCASH token and consuming the utility of procuring shoppers and their data.

The problem is that the Bitcoin Cash advocates include maligning another cryptocurrency (Bitcoin Core) as part of their marketing campaign. That's the problem.

*A hard fork requires waiting for sufficient consensus

*Risk of catastrophic consensus failure

*An emergency hard fork that can achieve consensus can be deployed on a short time period if needed

*Orphan rate amplification, more reorgs and double-spends due to slower propagation speeds

*""Congestion"" concerns can be solved with mempool improvements including transaction eviction

*No amount of max block size would support all the world's future transactions on the main blockchain

*Fast block propagation is either not clearly viable, or creates centralized controls

*Larger blocks make full nodes more expensive to operate

*Larger blocks lead to fewer hashers running full nodes, which leads to centralized entities having more power, which makes Bitcoin require more trust, which weakens Bitcoin's value proposition

*The larger the hash-rate a single miner controls, the more centralized Bitcoin becomes and the more trust using Bitcoin requires",1525513047

Now what I meant is exactly what you as well understood, here so points to further elaborate and make myself clear:
a) yes I'd prefer to transact in a currency that only I can control, provided that there are tools that are making this control easier for say technically illiterate folks
b) I still can be tracked, by associating my transaction behavior and address of my wallet (see IRS investigation into Silk Road or BitFury providing institutional tools #middlefinger-to-bitfure
c) there are offerings on the market that will make my transactions go dark
d) these cryptographic tools are far away from consumer adoption and we'll have to see how they play out
e) finally I was not referring much to the currency transactions and I have whole other view on it which frankly let's not get into. What I referred to was that immutability and decentralization as an overall blanket for all online activity and preach that this is the way to go is a  bit disturbing to me. But yes I agree the point probably made in this post comprised only currency transactions and not everything else.

(lastly) but I hate to say it there is nothing black and white, as much as I'd benefit from immutability, I'd might be embarrassed by it, if cryptography is not stellar around securing my privacy over it and there is a breach I even might be manipulated by some bullshit I did. You don't believe humans are perfect do you? Because we're flawed all and we'll fuck up one way or another.

So yes alternative currency I'M ALL FOR IT.

So basically both parties need to have collateral to trade, but spawns the chicken and egg problem though. Say I'm new to Bitcoin, I just want to buy bitcoin with P2P bank transfer, but I would need to have some bitcoins first in order to buy bitcoins.

Given the scenario:

* A = Seller (good guy) - Trading on Bisq
* B = Buyer (scam artist) - Trading on Bisq
* C = Outsider - Not Trading on Bisq

- A posts to sell BTC on Bisq. B clicks on the post to buy from A. 

- Both provides their collateral to trade. Meanwhile, B posts an ad to sell BTC on craigslist for a good price, C then contacts B to buy BTC. 

- Then B gives the bank account of A to C, telling him that he would transfer the BTC once he has transferred the money. 

- After A receives the money, he releases the BTC to B. And no disputes were filled because it seems like it was a legitimate trade. A got his money, and released BTC to B.

- C on the other hand is the losing end, he pays A and not receiving any BTC. And B just disappears. 

Although it might seem unreal, that why would someone trade on craigslist. It does happen, and till today there's no real solution to this. 

Question is, is Bisq able to solve this? Would be glad to hear your opinion on this.",1525511949

This harms adoptionm perception and the future price of bitcoin.",1525510777
Very well said!I think at one point you are correct and most of the people now has a positive outlook how the crypto community will answer to the peoples need.,1525510730
"and you Think with this Future non miner Crypto there cant be a Community Split? come on Dude, its Not the Coin its the People. they will always fight for what they Think is right.",1525510694
"I don‚Äôt think you understand what I wrote. 

Bitcoin Core (the Bitcoin Core software client) won the naming war by having the most hashpower (ie the most miners running their Bitcoin Core software client) immediately after the fork. Thus the blockchain being generated by the network of miners running Bitcoin Core‚Äôs reference client or a compatible variant won the rights to be called Bitcoin. ",1525510634
"But Bitcoin is still Bitcoin. It's still based on a consensus. BCH is, by definition, not Bitcoin, and therefore they should not represent it as such. Call it Bitcoin Origin, or Bitcoin Original, or WHATEVER, but it's not Bitcoin, and the way in which the BCH community has misrepresented it as Bitcoin is pretty messed up.

I'm really still torn on the issue, and for the most part I'm just done with Bitcoin entirely. I have about 10&amp;#37; in it and that's it, but I really don't see it as the future of crypto, mostly because of the exact reasons you stated previously. The community became too divided and scalability is too big of an issue for BTC, imo, for it to succeed as a true digital currency.",1525510631
"In a perfect world we could and would just let BCH stand on its own merits, but when we have an army of paid propaganda campaigns crashing against us every day simple altruism isn't enough. We'd like to be able to just build what we wanted, but Blockstream won't have that. 

We wanted bigger blocks, they kicked us out. We finally split off, and they increased their troll campaigns and tried to rename the project ""bcash"" instead of finally leaving us alone *after doing what they wanted us to* in just leaving. 

The only conclusion I can come to then is that destroying BTC and the fucksticks that took it over by any means \(legally\) necessary is the only way to make it stop then. The only way out is through, and they started this conflict, so fuck them. They called down the thunder, now they reap the whilwind of BCH beating their ass with Satoshi's original coin. ",1525510592
He literally threw the entire BTC community under the bus and he‚Äôll do it to BCH too if there‚Äôs money to be made(stolen},1525510589
"Also another reason why BTC has likely screwed themselves over beyond repair. The entire BTC community has been so hostile to the miners who secure their network, that pretty much all of the big miners now openly prefer Bitcoin Cash. 

At this point, even if Bitcoin Core wanted to increase the block size, they would need the support of the miners to run their software, but the miners are already so heavily invested in the success of BCH that I don't see any reason why they would help BTC remain competitive. ",1525510561
"Their main public promoters are criminals(ver) or or pathological liars (wright) .  
  They have maybe 10-15% community support (price /hash rate) but they claim that they are bitcoin 
 They bought bitcoin.com and the bitcoin twitter handle to mislead People. 
  They call bitcoin bitcoin core to confuse ppl even though bitcoin core is only a client. Not the protocol...  
  They keep repeating that blockstream is behind everything without any proof whatsoever.  
  ",1525510527
Thing is people have actually lost money (sent to incorrect address) in the confusion where BCH calls itself Bitcoin which most people associate with BTC. ,1525510493
"Yes but the point is that most cryptocurrencies do not have a $ valuation, only a Bitcoin or Ether valuation since no trading is being done on them in dollars.

If the price of Bitcoin in dollars doubles, the price of cryptocurrencies that are only being traded against Bitcoin also double because they don't have a $ value, they are valued in BTC.

So how do you think that this is valid exactly?",1525510492
"Haha, mate. I'm just as invested in BCH as BTC. It is absolutely dishonest and the majority feel the same way. 

I would be far happier if they just stopped trying to pretend to be Bitcoin which already exists and forge their own path. It'll only make both coins more valuable in the future.

You can rage against this machine as hard as you like, argue semantics as much as you please but it's completely transparent as to what is happening. ",1525510482

&gt;Security deposits create incentives for both buyer and seller to  follow the rules of Bisq's trading protocol. They are locked into  multisig escrow along with the bitcoin being traded, and are returned to  each user when the trade completes successfully. If a trade goes to  arbitration and one party is found to have violated Bisq's trading  protocol, some or all of that party's security deposit may be awarded to  their counterparty. Examples of protocol violations include a buyer  failing to pay a seller, or a seller failing to acknowledge receipt of a  buyer's payment. Most Bisq trades complete without any problem thanks  in part to the incentives that security deposits create.

"I can't make myself read this brain-numbing rant, this guy and people like him are why I no longer interact with Twitter.

I'll start by just pointing out that in my experience aggression and intelligence are negatively correlated.  The calm guy is almost always the guy winning the argument.

I just wanted to address this:

&gt;  it's obvious to me there is a fundamental problem w/ a global-state network designed in such a way that it will FOREVER require EVERY single node to get &amp; process EVERY single past &amp; present state change.

that was also obvious to almost all of us as well when we first started to understand Bitcoin.  James Donald pointed it out to Satoshi:

&gt; To detect and reject a double spending event in a timely manner, one must have most past transactions of the coins in the transaction, which, naively implemented, requires each peer to have most past transactions, or most past transactions that occurred recently. If hundreds of millions of people are doing transactions, that is a lot of bandwidth

There it is. ""Naively implemented"" Bitcoin would require everyone to keep a record of all transactions - ie ""everyone must run a full node.""

Satoshi corrects him:

&gt; Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or about 12KB per day.

The response to this from Giacomo is

&gt; Satoshi's fraud-proofs turned out to be unfeasible, making SPV basically trust-based &amp; the ""few big masternodes"" model easy to censor/attack

There it is.  Satoshi was wrong about SPV.

It's supposedly easy to censor or attack SPV?  Really?

**DO IT**

I double red-dog dare ya.

In the history of Bitcoin, not a single enduser has ever been defrauded because he was using SPV, *even though the overwhelming majority of users have SPV wallets*.  SPV is arguably safer for endusers if correctly engineered because in general an SPV client will stay with majority hashpower in the event of a rules conflict.

In the event of a rules conflict, on which chain will your capital still be accessible?  *The majority chain.*  The only thing a fullnode can do for you here is *prevent you from being with the majority* or in other words a full node introduces the risk that you will follow an insecure chain.  I can say for sure that for the average user, the safest way for them to protect their capital is to ensure that they are using an SPV client that will stick with Nakamoto Consensus, as represented by the majority chain.

To think that users are better off not trusting Nakamoto Consensus is the pinnacle of convincing users *against the basic vision of Bitcoin.*",1525510177

"Block size increase leading to mining centralisation is only a theory, and when the maths is done, it's an obvious non issue. The theory is bigger blocks will lead to more centralised miners, because less miners can afford storage space and bandwidth. But the reality is, you can get 3 years worth of 8mb blocks on a 400$ hard drive, which is pennies compared to what a miner spends on electricity and other equipment. Because of this obvious flaw in the miner centralisation with big blocks  narrative, the goalposts were moved. Now the issue is because normal users will not be able to run a full node which will lead to centralisation. There are two problems with this. Firstly, non mining nodes do not secure the network, secondly, bitcoin supports light clients with spv, which allows users to verify transactions without downloading the full blockchain.

Taking all this into account, why was a block increase to 2mb so far fetched? It would have allowed bitcoin fees to stay low for another year at least, and maybe LN would be ready by then.",1525508451

If BCH had gotten the most PoW and market cap early on, this would be a no brainer.  If it got it today, it *might* be something.  But BCH is many many months behind in total POW - and still falling further behind.  By the time it catches up, it will be far too late to change such a definition in the consciousness of people.

I argue that people should understand that BCH did come from the legacy of Bitcoin, and from the community - it should not forget that heritage nor the reasons it forked off.

"I reply to this one ass we are requested to keep things civil and also to share some of the little knowledge I have to some of the new people who are interested in crypto.

\(note for other posters I saw in this thread, try and find out the difference between n00b and newb and use the right term next time\)

On topic, this whole discussion is just trying to take control of the name ""BitCoin"" taking advantage that people do not read the whitepaper and just see the word ""Cash"" in the title which is used in the name ""Bitcoin *Cash*"".

People who do not like Bitcoin Cash call it B\-CasH which fits with BCH. In response, people who like Bitcoin *Cash* call Bitcoin BTC ""Bitcoin* Core""*. 

Adult behaviour from people who own, on paper, many millions of equivalent fiat.. I think not.

All of this is just plain silly and to a large part infantile as the whitepaper is just 9 pages of high level theory.

These 9 pages include a summary, graphs, lots of white\-space and a whole page reserved for just 8 references.

That's it, nothing more, the real work was done outside of the whitepapers by brilliant and enthusiastic developers. It is fantastic and amazing what came out of just these couple of pages of text.

BCH is the one fork of Bitcoin out of many which causes trouble. \(full list below\)

A reason for the tweet quoted in this thread is that the BCH camp considers that Segwit as implemented on Bitcoin is not in the original whitepaper and because BCH was created from a hardfork from BTC on August 1st before Segwit was implemented it is closer to the original ""vision"". \(remember: the ""vision"" was a couple of pages\)

In fact, neither are the ""original vision"" as neither realistically have a ""one CPU one vote"" mining capability which was actually spelled out in the whitepaper.

""Original vision"" = Dogmatism. History proves that dogmatism never ends well.

In any case, the point stated in the tweet is moot as BCH was a HARD\-fork from BTC, forked on August 1st 2017 whereas BTC continued as BTC. So.... BTC is the original Bitcoin, BCH is a new implementation with a new blockchain.

Not saying which one is better, honestly, I do not care that much at the moment other than I do not trust the \(public\)people behind BCH much.

Note that the difference between a soft\- and a hard\-fork is that a hard\-fork creates a new chain and therefore a new crypto. In other words: BCH is a new Bitcoin implementation but there is nothing wrong with having a new Bitcoin implementation! There are many already.

Imagine if a modern Ford would be like the original model\-T! Fun to ride yes but not very useful today.

Adaptation to new requirements is also why Bitcoin soft forked on August 24th, 2017 to allow Segwit. SOFT\-fork: change the implementation, no new crypto.

\(look up Segwit:[http://lmgtfy.com/?q=what\+is\+BTC\+segwit](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=what+is+BTC+segwit)\)

What is bad about the BCH fork is that the creators of the new implementation \(BCH\) started even before the fork with a campaign to hijack the name Bitcoin to benefit from the name recognition. The main participants you can look up, they are very smart, appear to be rich on paper, and clever but I question their morals.

\(I say rich on paper as I see some of the key players giving webcam interviews from hotels where I would not even go to\)

As from the start, some twitter accounts, websites, redditors, etc switched allegiance from BTC to BCH and some back again. Perhaps they were paid, perhaps not but it just caused confusion and as a consequence newcomers cant distinguish anymore between what is valid information and what is a shill post. \(to illustrate, I saw the question earlier if the @bitcoin twitter handle is about BCH  and the @BTC handle is about Bitcoin and the fact that on Reddit r/bitcoin is about Bitcoin\(BTC\) and r/BTC is about Bitcoin Cash \(BCH\)\)

Its a JOKE! 

Anyway, dogmatic people will always act in a dogmatic way and I really do not like the mudslinging back and forth, it hurts the reputation of both BTC and BCH and this is not needed as each can stand on its own.

What I love about the whole thing is the pumps and dumps.  BCH fans pump it, BTC fans dump it. I benefit. Well, at least I try to. 

Tip: Pay attention to upcoming TV interviews and fora on BCH. This is usually preceded by a dump followed by an immediate sustained pump with massive gains of 20\-30&amp;#37; a day. Afterwards, its dumped again so try and get out before and don't be too greedy.

Take care and take it with a grain of salt.

2 - The price of Bitcoin rises and he owes more than he recieved in the sale. His fronted money guarantees this debt. He can close and take the loss, or when his money runs out the exchange will sell all the coins for him and he takes a 100% loss on the money he fronted.

Even NIST has stated that BCH is Bitcoin and that BTC no longer is.

This is why there was for a while a push to simply just rewrite the original Satoshi white paper and ""retcon"" it into matching the current BTC.

Bitcoin or not Bitcoin is purely semantics at this point. BTC got to keep the name when the coin split into two 100% identical chains of Bitcoin, because more people felt that was Bitcoin at the time. 

Now, that is much less easy to argue, as it no longer is from a technical point of view. BTC has changed far far more from the original Bitcoin than BCH has. ",1525506097

"Originally the altcoin market was made up almost entirely of this.  They were uncreative bitcoin clones with a small twist or gimmick.  The OG altcoin Litecoin literally just changed a few numbers in the code and rolled out.  There was actually a time when altcoin investors mostly believed there would be a cryptocoin for ____, another for ____, another for ____...  A new money for each type of product, which makes no economical sense.

After this cash-grab effort went out of style, new projects started getting creative with new mining algorithms, anonymity, scaleability solutions.  The was actual effort being put into *better* USVAs meant to become THE one USVA.  Or at least they tried convincing people as such.  The truth is almost all improvements by other USVA coins are things that have been considered by the Bitcoin community and generally rejected as not feasible, necessary, practical, secure... Basically the features aren't features at all.  They are promotional attempts.

The previous effort is still ongoing, although it has generally given way to the most recent cash-grab effort, which is the blockchain-actually-has-way-more-use-than-USVA trend.  It's no longer about creating a better money, but about using blockchain (the very simple and specific invention meant to support a USVA) for anything and everything.  Everyone wants to be smart and get in early on the next big thing, so it works.  The more confusing and convoluted the ""idea"", the better the non-USVA-coin does.  Many investors don't know what the altcoins are even supposed to do, certainly almost none know how they actually work (or if they are even technically possible), and absolutely NO ONE is using these non-USVA coins for literally anything besides storing/moving value or hoping to return gains.

"Owning lots of shares of snapchat ensures you own a piece of the future profit from the users.

Owning lots of shitcoins only ensures you have a piece of some early blockchain ledgers.  In bitcoin this seems to mean something, as it's made to be a Universally desired, Scarce, Value-storing Asset (""USVA"" - only making the term up to be specific).  So far users have remained relatively convinced of it's scarcity.  There is no need for multiple USVA's;  In fact by definition it undermines the scarcity aspect and would cannibalize the entire space.  So you have three outcomes:

1) Investors seek to own all the shitcoins for purpose of USVA's, somewhat converging their values.  The concept is cannibalized, undermined, and all values plummet.

2) Everyone seeks to only (or at least primarily) own the most legitemate USVA(s) (based on age/usage/adoption/so forth).  Likely Bitcoin absorbs much of the market share.  Most altcoin projects lose value and die off.

3) These altcoin projects don't end up being used as USVAs, but serve some new purpose entirely (am not even sure what this would be, as ""public ledger"" blockchains are clunky, poorly scaleable, and not economical for much besides a USVA).  Some of these altcoin projects will likely amount to something, simply because they are made up of teams of inspired programmers.  They'll end up creating something related to their original blockchain-project, but that isn't really dependent on blockchain.  The holders of AltCoin won't own any shares of this AltCompany **because coins don't represent anything legally and there is no incentive to give away free equity to blockchain ""owners"" to a non-blockchain project.**

The trading behavior we are seeing in the alt-coin market is *actually fucking insane*.  No, not ""unusual, new, surprising, groundbreaking.""  It's actual crazy and irrational nonsense.  People are lobbing money into projects simply hoping to be ""early"", even though they get no legal equity or proprietary ownership.  For things that aren't even meant to be USVAs, which seem to be the only situation where ownership of a blockchain has value.

It's incredibly sketchy and causes confusion for people new to the space especially with the stunt they pulled on bitcoin.com and probably the reason why I won't own any any time soon. ",1525503603
