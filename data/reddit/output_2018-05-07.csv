"1. It is negligible and even if it wasn't every crypto is working towards free payments. A toddler could understand this argument.

Quick question so I have cash to spare and I'm looking for Coins with low value for short term investment. I was wondering if the bigger the volume matters when looking at coins less than a dollar?

"&gt;**The Aftermath**

&gt;Bitcoin would eventually recover. Users who became frustrated at the extreme unreliability would give up and stop trying to spend their coins. Many coins would make it to an exchange wallet and stay there. Node operators would make their nodes auto-restart. SPV wallets would find some trustworthy central authority to get fee data from.

&gt;Most importantly, the overload would eventually go away …. because the users would go away. The backlog would clear. Fees would fall to the minimum again.

&gt;So life would go on.

&gt;Bitcoin would survive.

&gt;But it would have lost critical momentum. It would have become the MySpace of digital currencies. The faithful would have lost a lot of faith, and businesses that were trying to bring Bitcoin to the mainstream would “pivot” towards something else. People who were motivated by Making The World A Better Place™ would conclude the ordinary people around them would never use their products, and so they’d leave.",1525762023

"**Advance-fee scam**

An advance-fee scam is a form of fraud and one of the most common types of confidence trick. The scam typically involves promising the victim a significant share of a large sum of money, in return for a small up-front payment, which the fraudster requires in order to obtain the large sum. If a victim makes the payment, the fraudster either invents a series of further fees for the victim or simply disappears. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), ""An advance fee scheme occurs when the victim pays money to someone in anticipation of receiving something of greater value—such as a loan, contract, investment, or gift—and then receives little or nothing in return."" 

There are many variations of this type of scam, including the 419 scam (also known as the Nigerian Prince scam), the Spanish Prisoner scam, the black money scam, Fifo's Fraud and the Detroit-Buffalo scam.

"So as is my understanding, when a bitcoin block is successfully ""mined"", the miner can include any pending transactions into the block (up to some limit), taking the miner fee on those for them self. And they can ""create"" some amount of bitcoin, which is how more BTC is introduced to the economy.  
  
So....  
1) From a high level, am I understanding this correctly? If not, what do I have incorrect?  
2) What determines the amount of BTC ""created"" when a block is mined?  
3) When the cap of BTC is reached, is the miner fees the only incentive miners have? And if so, is that going to be enough to make it worth their time? If yes, how? If not, then how are transactions verified and processed?",1525761076

"&gt; other coins with the same properties as bitcoin that can handle more transaction

Bitcoin favors decentralization over transaction throughput.

And throughput has improved dramatically — the current levels wouldn’t be possible with the older software. Older versions would struggle to keep up verifying signatures and syncing would take months and the number of people willing to run a node would be way less.

&gt; a true weakness in the bitcoin system

It is not a weakness. It is a direct result of being decentralized which poses fundamental limitations to transaction throughput. More throughput means lower node count, basically, due to the increased levels of bandwidth and computing resources required.

&gt; LN (...) isn't the solution to scaling

The jury is still out on that. LN has the potential to increase throughput by orders of magnitudes. A doubling of the blocksize is only a doubling in capacity at the expense of decentralization.

Bitcoin derives its value entirely from the fact that it is decentralized. For transaction processing there are tons of other cheap options that Bitcoin will never be able to compete with since thousands of nodes have to store every single transaction on-chain for eternity.

LN changes the game, and off-chain transaction processing is the only way to mass-adoption. On-chain scaling is a dead-end.",1525760808

&gt;For the early adopters of today, Lightning is still a complex technology. lnd 0.4.1-beta users must understand how the protocol and payment channels work and this involves knowledge from fields like cryptography, security, game theory, economics, and more. This is in addition to Bitcoin itself, which is already a complex topic. However, as Lightning matures, we’ll be working to improve the Lightning user experience to become more simple, intuitive and familiar. Ideally, users like Carol will manage balances, payments and deposits without having to understand the underlying technology, and the experience will be cheaper and more convenient than existing payment technologies (checks, credit cards, physical cash, etc.).

"I'm referring to the overly complex cryptosystem that is Ethereum.

Poor design decisions throughout production have led to a scripting system poorly implemented and so difficult to use safely, that [the creator of the scripting system created a multisig smart contract which locked $300M in funds](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/08/cryptocurrency-300m-dollars-stolen-bug-ether). Keep in mind that multisig is one of *the* simplest smart contracts.

In addition, Ethereums cryptosystem is designed in a manner which results in a large attack surface. Namely, [use of proof of stake](https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/pos.pdf), and the new sharding implementation, which if left unchanged will result in thin-client security for each individual shard. That is, if someone can compromise a single shard and move ""fake"" funds to another shard. Again, all other shards will only be validating headers, in other words they have thin client security.

I could go on, but I'll just say the general fault derives from complexity and ignoring best practices. A cryptosystems definition should be minimal. A cryptosystem should be thoroughly reviewed. [A cryptocurrency should not be thrown together carelessly](https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/alts.pdf).",1525755680

"It is simpler than that  
You do not need to know the customer's Bitcoin address  

Abandon the misconception that you only have one address. Read this:  

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Address_reuse  

&gt; Address reuse refers to the use of the same address for multiple transactions. It is an unintended practice, abusing the privacy and security of the participants of the transactions as well as future holders of their value. It also only functions by accident, not by design, so cannot be depended on to work reliably

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Address  

&gt; A Bitcoin address is a single-use token  
&gt; people have many different Bitcoin addresses and a unique address should be used for each transaction  
&gt; Addresses are not intended to be used more than once, and doing so has numerous problems associated

Your wallet creates a new receiving address for every expected receipt  

*    issue a new receiving address for every sale  
*    send the address to the customer  
*    keep a list linking each address to its sale/invoice  

Then when your wallet tells you it has received Bitcoins, you can see which address received the money, and your list tells you which invoice is being paid  

To make it easier to track your receipts, install a watching-only Electrum wallet on a PC or mobile device. Watching-only wallets only contain addresses, not private keys. They are useful for monitoring incoming coins. Copy and paste all your addresses into the waching-only Electrum wallet, and have a look at it a few times every day",1525754947

"&gt; 1) Why would a gov crypto be inflationary? 

Honestly, you don't even understand the first thing about gov control of money if you can't answer this immediately. The entire point of issuing a currency IS TO INFLATE IT, because by doing so, the government becomes the beneficiary of wealth, and with that wealth they buy power. Inflation silently and invisibly steals purchasing power from all holders of that currency and transfers it to the newly issued money.

&gt; I could be designed however you want it to.

Governmens would never make any currency they could not control, and every government on the planet inflates today. In theory they could not inflate, but that defeats the purpose of controlling the money, again.

Half the point of cryptocurrency in the first place was to escape inflation.

&gt; It'd be more democratic and acceptable than giving satoshi 1M coins (both bitcoin and BCH).

Disagree. Giving one group the power to steal from everyone forever is not remotely democratic nor acceptable.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 2) I'm not talking about gold in the earth's core - that is inconsequential.

That's the only gold on the planet that could possibly make up the 30,000% shortfall in issued future-gold-mining shares. There's far more gold in the core than in the crust today.

&gt; We know the relative abundance of things. It's about sampling and statistics and it's provable.

Gold mining has been dropping off significantly. The experts say there's no possible way that much gold exists. That IS THE POINT.

The market doesn't seem to care though, why? Because the point of these gold shares is to hold DOWN the price of gold by artificially-inflating the supply of gold. This allows governments all around the world to inflate their currencies without people trying to escape into GOLD to avoid the inflation and wrecking the inflation scheme thereby.

Governments are able to do this because they and their allies issue new fiat to purchase gold-mining shares, which they can do infinitely by printing more money, such that the market considers them non-risky since they continue to get purchased.

It's a giant scam.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 3) What is the significance of 300 times again?

Take the entire amount of gold that has been mined in all of human history.

300 times this amount has been sold as paper-gold.

If that isn't self-explanatory I can't imagine what is.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 4) Price instability is due to value being based on it's utility (or potential utility), not it's physical properties. 

Its utility does not materially change over time, so you cannot explain price volatility in that way. What changes is consumer confidence in that object. I.O.W.: its youth and the uncertainty created by it, is why its price changes. 

&gt; When people stop accepting a specific crypto, it is really worth 0. That is the most scary kind of volatility.

The same would be true of any fiat currency. Just that happened in Ecuador, which does not have it's own state currency today because it was inflated to hell and the citizens rejected it. A similar fate is probably in store for the Venezuelan bolivar.



&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 5) In terms of viable substitutes - there really isn't any other material as suitable as money as gold. History shows this. 

Being a gold bug is one thing, but I don't deal in irrational fandom of specific objects.

I look instead at the specific qualities that are desirable in a currency.

If you look at those qualities, it is irrespective of the object itself. If something besides gold had more of the desirable qualities in a currency than gold does, I would conclude that is a superior currency, and likely to be recognized as such by the market over time.

After all, that is how gold and silver became our top currencies today, because they had the best combination of qualities desirable to have in a currency. Silver was actually better because it was more suitable for smaller amounts of money. A dollar gold coin would be the size of the period at the end of this sentence.

If you dispassionately examine cryptocurrency and gold along the lines of qualities desirable in a money, you will find that crypto has all of the qualities that made gold and silver a good money, and a few more than gold and silver cannot ever have.

You cannot transmit gold and silver at lightspeed across the planet. Both are bulky compared to crypto, and expensive to secure and to move physically. Crypto by contrast moves at lightspeed, takes up virtually zero physical space, is fairly cheap to secure long-term, and easy to move. You can even store crypto purely in your own head.

It is these kinds of analyses that led many of us to get into crypto in the first place, and I think you will agree that crypto has been a far better investment than gold has been in our lifetime.",1525752347

Or say the air force accidentally bombs and kills a bunch of russian and syrian troops (oops wait they already did that), who do we reach out to to ""verify"" that? Russia? The military? Most news relies on critical thinking on the part of the consumer, and like usual, there were plenty of people saying this SEC ""hearing"" wasn't going to happen, they were just ignored. 

This could also actually just be one step further to a dystopian ""crypto"" based future. Could you imagine if every single transaction you've ever made ever was permanently recorded and cataloged, and news articles were only taken seriously if governments and corporations ""voted"" on them?

"&gt; It's way too small to know if it's going to work at scale which I don't believe it will.

Why?

&gt;It certainly is very far from being ""fully operational"" as you describe.

Why? There are additional features to be added on the client level (things like watchtowers) but the network is fully operational as it's intended to operate. How can you claim otherwise?

The videos you linked are bullshit (seen both already). The first is FUD and the second is pure propaganda. Not sure why you even linked it if you've seen the Antonopolous rebuttal. I'm not going to spend the time to respond piece by piece but you should really think twice about using those as sources in future conversations on this topic. They're grossly misinformed and the second is a clear hit piece. 

&gt;Up and running means it's ready for broader adoption which from what I can tell it isn't. There is a long way to go and some major issues to overcome before it's ready for broad use, and that's what I'd be asking for before I can believe this outdoes Satoshi's original vision for Bitcoin.

This is FUDdy nonsense. BCashers love to move the goal posts whenever necessary. First was ""LN is never coming"", now it's ""LN isn't at scale"". Beta was just released less than 45 days ago. Chill out, these things don't happen overnight. 

&gt;My 18 months comment was a dig at the fact that Core have been saying 18 months for a long time now.

Who is this ""core"" monolith that you keep referencing? Bitcoin =/= Bitcoin Core. Also, it's here now, as I said, so what's the issue? Keep on moving those goal posts.

&gt;I thought I explained the use of the word trap - I'll give you the real trap - BCore saying you can't scale on chain, clogging the network pushing people to transact off chain, and guess where they have to go to do that? The profit making LN, profiting Blockstream. It's really not that hard to see.

Lmao. This is such conspiracy nonsense. It makes absolutely no sense and is not backed by evidence. Seriously, this tired line about how Blockstream is in bed with bankers or whomever is just such nonsense. We're talking about open source code here. LN is not some giveaway to banks, despite how you seem to frame it as such.

Also, ""BCore"" never said that you can't scale on chain. People said that scaling exclusively on chain is a road to nowhere, and the vast number of qualified developers agree (and the market agrees too).

&gt;As for BCH not having a long term plan, well it is, unlike BCore it seems, a permissionless network so innovation is rife amongst a community that is following Satoshi's vision so there is no explicit plan.

Lmao. Satoshi's vision. Shill harder, buddy. You don't know what Satoshi would say about the current state of things because he's not here to comment. It's a really cheap shot to exploit him to market your shitcoin. Even if he *were* to agree with BCashers, does it matter? Appeal from authority much? This is open source software, buddy. 

&gt;But we are moving forwards quickly, productively and creating a network that is already demonstrating significant progress. 

Dude, what? As I've pointed out a billion times, metrics look terrible for BCH right now. It's not even processing as many transactions as Segwit is by itself. Volume is terrible and there's no organic demand, only shills who claim it's the next Bitcoin. You're deluded if you think the outlook is somehow positive for BCH at the moment. Do you really not see and understand why it's ridiculed so heavily in the space. It's a joke that's frontrun by scammers. Literally. 

&gt;Set this against BCore's stalling and profiteering leads me to conclude that BCH will be the clear winner.

Most Bitcoin Core nodes do no mining.

Many if not most Bitcoin Core nodes are run for the benefit of the person running them: to know for sure that their transactions are valid. Many are also ""altruistically"" run to help the network be more decentralized.

I get your point of distinction: BTC could still be BTC if Bitcoin Core went away and was replaced with another client. It doesn't need a ""reference client""... However, in point of fact it does have one, as almost all if not absolutely all cryptocurrencies do. Bitcoin Core currently is the code that enforces/runs the consensus rules accepted by the vast majority of the network. In practical terms, right now, Bitcoin Core is not that separable from Bitcoin itself.

Naming is important, of course. Bitcoin is Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency, and ""Bitcoin Core"" is not a coin, it is the software that is most commonly used to run/confirm/enforce Bitcoin as defined by the consensus of those running it.",1525751902

As for BCH not having a long term plan, well it is, unlike BCore it seems, a permissionless network so innovation is rife amongst a community that is following Satoshi's vision so there is no explicit plan.  But we are moving forwards quickly, productively and creating a network that is already demonstrating significant progress. Set this against BCore's stalling and profiteering leads me to conclude that BCH will be the clear winner.  I'm sure you think otherwise, that's fine, competition is great!  Let's just all try and stay positive.",1525750483

"Imagine if when oil is drilled, it’s paid for in crypto. if facebook or google makes a profit, it’s paid in crypto.

You can’t name 1.

If you truly understand economics, you’d understand that all money is “Funny money”. The dollar is just a piece of paper, crypto is just a digital coins, stocks are just slips of paper. At the end of the day, everything is “speculative” only worth as much as another person is willing to pay for it. So like I said, no difference between stocks, dollars, crypto. They are all speculative, the general population speculates that the dollar will always be stable, yet it will drop slowly in value. While I speculate that blockchain will destroy the current fiat system.

And usually the response I get is ""Oh is that like bitcoin?""

If your default view is not really understanding why it has value or how currencies can have value without central authority over them... Then it's totally understandable how he thinks this is all a scam.

If you believe value of currenecy is purely derrived from central authority, then yes, under that perspective crypto is absolutely a scam.

The problem is that you can actually spend crypto in the status quo. So it's really weird for me to have someone saying the entire idea of decentralized currency is a scam. It would easily be the greatest scam in human history if the entire crypto market had actual zero value.

And honestly to the general public, it's so fucking easy to make the 'crypto is a scam argument'. 

Because to explain why it's not you have to explain blockchain to people, which I fucking hate doing. My shortest crash course explanation to people that have never heard of anything crypto related is like 2-3 minutes.

Where as you can make the ""It's literally digital currency that people create out of the internet and save on hard drives, it's not worth anything."" argument in like 3 seconds, and it's honestly a pretty intuitive argument. It just raises the question ""Why do people still like it or use it then?"" To which these guys have no answers other than ""Anyone using it just bought into the scam."" 

But again, you can make the same argument with any centralized currency.

Currencies have no inherent value, they have value based on use and belief in the currency, so the very pretense of people buying into a 'scam' (if eth / btc / crypto is a scam) would, by any economists perspective, give crypto value.

"I'm still confused. LN is up an running, though the clients are in beta. It's not in ""testing mode"", it's live on main-net, with really money (Bitcoins) in play. It's also growing very quickly, ever day, as seen [here](https://lnmainnet.gaben.win/). Again, I'm not sure what else you can really ask for. The clients are still in beta but that doesn't mean the network isn't fully operational, it is. I would suspect beta testing on these primary clients to end within about 6 months or so, not 18 months. Meanwhile there's little-to-no demand for BCH (or really any crypto payment processing) so I don't understand what the trap is here. LN is far superior to big block BCH in every meaningful regard. BCH doesn't have a viable long-term plan, it's just buying time for additional pump and dumps before the market finally puts it to rest.

He was talking about BTC. I don’t really like the analogy in this context though for some reason.,1525749052
"&gt;Wall of text aside

You could choose to skip over the bulk of that wall - the extensive quote description given by Satoshi of why he intentionally made transactions replaceable. I even considered chopping it up to highlight the most relevant portions. However, I found it insightful to see how much thought had been put into that design decision, which just might be the most relevant thing about it.

&gt; But zero-conf used to work great for the most part, as Erik and many others have pointed out.

&gt;&gt; It is true that zero-conf is risky, and true that many have gotten, and will get, burned by supporting it.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I get it. I'm one of those who has gotten burned by it, numerous times.

I accept that is a subjective measure, but that doesn't sound like it ever worked _great_. Which is very much the point I'm making. If you like 0-conf, you can use it under RBF with the same conditions as always - ensure the transaction has maximum nSequenceNumbers and a sufficient fee to likely be included in the next block. I know this makes it expensive and cumbersome to use with BTC, yet by vilifying RBF, you miss out on demonstrating how its benefits can be achieved without additional risk when a sufficient block size prevents massive backlogs. This is a substantial advantage that big blocks confer.

The Great Molasses Flood, also known as the Boston Molasses Disaster or the Great Boston Molasses Flood, occurred on January 15, 1919 in the North End neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. A large molasses storage tank burst and a wave of molasses rushed through the streets at an estimated 35 mph (56 km/h), killing 21 and injuring 150. The event entered local folklore and for decades afterwards residents claimed that on hot summer days the area still smelled of molasses.

But the new operation at ICE would provide more direct access to Bitcoin by putting the actual tokens in the customer’s account at the end of the trade.

ICE has had conversations with other financial institutions about setting up a new operation through which banks can buy a contract, known as a swap, that will end with the customer owning Bitcoin the next day — with the backing and security of the exchange, according to the people familiar with the project.

The swap contract is more complicated than an immediate trade of dollars for Bitcoin, even if the end result is still ownership of a certain amount of Bitcoin.

Not true. This is why we have perverse situations such as Eclair users thinking they are a node on the Lightning Network when they are not - this is why they cannot receive funds using Eclair but can send them using carefully crafted and manually adjusted (by the Eclair devs) payment routes without having to actually do real routing.

"DTR is the token of the Tokens exchange site. It is used to pay fees on the exchange and all such fees are removed from circulation (burnt).For example if you purhcase $1,000 worth of BTC with a fee of 0.15% you'd be burning $1.50 worth of DTR, or 15-20 DTR at there current price. This lowers the total supply of DTR as it is being removed from circulation, but it also creates demand pressure as it's filling sell orders in the market. Both of which put upward pressure on the price of DTR. One temporarily, one permanently.

There are a couple of other exchanges doing something similar, however they are all slightly different, and in my opinion have drawbacks of there own.

Binance is similar, but I believe the coins are purchased as a lump, or over a short period, which is know about, so the price should go up prior to the burn, meaning fewer BNB tokens are actually burnt than in the case of DTR. Also BNB only uses (IIRC) 20% of profits to purchase BNB for the burn, whereas DTR is 100% of fees, which should be a higher %.

If you compare DTR to Kucoin or Coss then it's essentially like reinvesting dividends, rather than paying them out. In Coss you get paid based on the amount of trading in a given day/week/month, however once that's paid out the benefit is gone. DTR is ""paid out"" by buying and burning DTR so the benefit is a long term effect on price.

The drawback of the DTR is that price may not actually go up. In Coss and Kucoin you're guaranteed a payout. In BNB you get 50% or something off fees. In DTR the price should go up, but may not. You also get a non-binding, in future progressions, which may be cool, but unlikely to really affect anything as there's likely to be whales who dominate the vote. Also it's non-binding.

The current marketing/advertising around DTR is essentially non-existant which is mirrored in trading volumes. This is fine and not too much to worry about since Tokens.net is currently in beta stage. But hopefully over the next couple of months DTR awareness picks up otherwise the platform might just fall into the background.

"Just a quick question about the LN: when you request a payment the routing information gets propagated using Sphynx Onion Routing, right? 

That being said, can't the douches at Chainalysis monitor balances across all channels on the network to deduct who sent whom money?

So Alice wants to pay Carol through Bob. Carol sells R to Bob for 1 BTC, and the channel balance shifts 1 BTC in Carol's favor.

Bob when turns around and sells Carol's R to Alice for 1.00000001 BTC provided Alice can provide the corresponding H. By doing this, the channel balance shifts 1.00000001 BTC in
Bob's favor.

Since LN tx's happen instantly (I assume) wouldn't be safe to assume you'd always always be able to identify all parties involved?

"&gt; it meant merchants could no longer reliably trust 0-conf transactions, because it removed the first-see, first-serve mentality that miners had always had

From [the earliest version of Satoshi's bitcoin client](https://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/code/1/tree/trunk/main.cpp#l427) until it was [disabled in v0.3.12](https://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/code/140/tree/trunk/main.cpp#l522), transactions with inputs using a less-than-maximum nSequence number could be replaced without even the requirement of a higher fee. The transaction replacement ability was [an intentional design decision](https://pastebin.com/JF3USKFT) to support multiple types of smart contracts.


&gt;It's for contracts.  An unrecorded open transaction can keep being replaced until nLockTime.  It may contain payments by multiple parties.  Each input owner signs their input.  For a new version to be written, each must sign a higher sequence number (see IsNewerThan).  By signing, an input owner says ""I agree to put my money in, if everyone puts their money in and the outputs are this.""  There are other options in SignatureHash such as SIGHASH_SINGLE which means ""I agree, as long as this one output (i.e. mine) is what I want, I don't care what you do with the other outputs."".  If that's written with a high nSequenceNumber, the party can bow out of the negotiation except for that one stipulation, or sign SIGHASH_NONE and bow out completely.
&gt;
&gt; The parties could create a pre-agreed default option by creating a higher nSequenceNumber tx using OP_CHECKMULTISIG that requires a subset of parties to sign to complete the signature.  The parties hold this tx in reserve and if need be, pass it around until it has enough signatures.
&gt;
&gt; One use of nLockTime is high frequency trades between a set of parties.  They can keep updating a tx by unanimous agreement.  The party giving money would be the first to sign the next version.  If one party stops agreeing to changes, then the last state will be recorded at nLockTime.  If desired, a default transaction can be prepared after each version so n-1 parties can push an unresponsive party out.  Intermediate transactions do not need to be broadcast.  Only the final outcome gets recorded by the network.  Just before nLockTime, the parties and a few witness nodes broadcast the highest sequence tx they saw.

As the code was disabled simply by short-circuiting the function rather than removing it entirely and commented as ""Disable replacement feature for now"", it is a reasonable conclusion that, much like the blocksize limit, it was meant to be a temporary measure. This is an intentional feature which the transaction format was specifically designed to accommodate.

BIP125 RBF is _more restrictive_ than bitcoin was originally, solving some of the vulnerabilities resulting from the costless implementation. While it is true that the a restrictive block size lengthens the window during which an unconfirmed transaction could be replaced - maliciously or unintentionally - it is far from accurate to say the miners always had a first-seen, first-serve mentality. There was a time between when Satoshi temporarily disabled the replacement feature and RBF was introduced to Bitcoin Core that FSS was _commonplace_, but it has always been an unenforceable convention, not a strong guarantee of 0-conf security.",1525745928

National fiat currencies also doesn't produce anything in themselves, yet may both rise and fall in relation to other currencies. Traditional fiat currencies are subject to high inflation through money printing and central bank directives while bitcoin's inherent rate of inflation is set to halve every 4 years. Bitcoin only needs to achieve less inflation than standard fiat currencies in order to appreciate in value over time. One inherent value is inflation\-resistance. Another inherent value is social trust.

When humans utilize wind, water and solar power, it's not because these natural phenomena produces anything particular, but rather, humans have found ingenious ways to produce energy from naturally occurring fluctuations in nature. Fluctuations in currencies, stock markets and precious metal markets generate profits as well. If we believe that stocks only generate money as a result of production, we forget about the main driving force for that profit: trust. When trust falls, stocks fall as well. Trust is an inherent social value that determines if a commodity is valuable.

When bitcoin rise in value over time, it's a result of inflation resistance, social trust and the inherent values of an autonomous and safe value transfer. Central banks no longer have monopoly over transfer of value. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have opened up a free market where money transfer is now subject to competition.

&gt; From a tax perspective, this scenario is identical to buying software with cryptocurrency. CRA policy says that transaction is a barter transaction. Each side of the transaction is characterized as a disposition of property, and each disposition is taxable as income or a capital gain based on the fair market value of the cryptocurrency at the time of the transaction.

2) 

&gt;Realization of capital gains occurs when you exchange your property for cash or other property that is valued greater than your cost. **This includes crypto-to-crypto exchanges**.

For the first link - read the articles, then read the links. Crypto-to-crypto transactions apply to either [Barter Transaction](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/it490-archived-barter-transactions.html) or [Transactions as Securities](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/it479r-archived-transactions-securities.html), depending on what you're trading.

"I'm sure there were other factors, but just having a pile of gold didn't accomplish anything for them.  Bitcoin can be a pet rock too if everyone just sits on it and refuses to use it for economic purposes.",1525745166
"&gt;While billionaire [Mark Cuban](https://www.celebritynetworth.com/articles/billionaire-news/mark-cuban-rather-pet-rock-buy-bitcoin/) would rather have a pet rock than bet on Bitcoin, [Jack Dorsey](https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-businessmen/ceos/jack-dorsey-net-worth/)  feels exactly the opposite. The Twitter CEO predicts that Bitcoin will  replace not just the dollar, but all world currencies in about a decade.  
&gt;  
&gt;However,  the nominee to be the new head of the New York Federal Reserve does not  agree with Dorsey. In a speech last Friday, John Williams spoke about  why cryptocurrencies cannot replace paper money. Williams pointed out  that cryptocurrency's value is volatile. How would one pay the correct  price for something with a currency that has a value that changes from  hour to hour?  
&gt;  
&gt;Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies also have a fixed supply. Paper  money is regulated by the amount of cash circulating and the world's  central banks can stabilize the economy by increasing or decreasing that  as needed.  
&gt;  
&gt;Cryptocurrency's fans are hoping the shortcomings of  the digital money can be solved. A new project called Basis seeks to set  the price of a cryptocurrency at $1. Basis raised $133 million in  venture capital funding. Basis is the brainchild of founder Nader  Al\-Naji, who is uncomfortable spending the Bitcoin he owns because he  thought it could gain in value.  
&gt;  
&gt;Currently Bitcoin is trading at  $8,800. Jack Dorsey thinks that it won't be long before Bitcoin is used  as money. He believes the world will move towards a single currency and  that will be Bitcoin.  
&gt;  
&gt;Dorsey's opinion comes at a time when the  debate over cryptocurrency is centered around how to regulate it.  Further complicating Dorsey idea is the fact that there are a number of  different digital currencies besides Bitcoin. How do you combine them  all?  
&gt;  
&gt;Where do you fall on the Bitcoin debate? Is it a passing fad or the future of currency?",1525745148

"&gt;In what way is Bitcoin unusable?

ok, from the top of my mind:

1. it cannot be used for micropayments
2. has negative adoption \(Steam. Microsoft. **UNUSABLE**\)
3. is unreliable for normal payments because fees can skyrocket any time
4. is unreliable for 0 conf transaction because of RBF

&gt;It's being used an order of magnitude more than Bitcoin Cash.

btc has a network effect which is wearing out, mixers inflate tx count too and nvertheless btc transactions are plummeting. BCH transactions on the other hand are at 80\-90&amp;#37; of ATH. This is a coin that is used at a grassroots level and growing organically.

&gt; A transaction gets included in the next block for a fraction of a dollar.

Maybe right now yes, last time I checked the avg fee was $2\+. **Transaction fee fluctuations make it unusable.**

&gt;There are four competing Lightning Network clients. The Lightning Network is already being used on the mainnet with 2000 nodes and 6000 payment channels. It's quite impressive at this early stage.

70&amp;#37; of LN payments fail. Maybe it's impressive for a fanboy like yourself, but not for me or other people looking for something reliable to use.

&gt;Claiming that Bitcoin is a Lightning Network ICO is insane.

If it's not a Lightning ICO, then how come everyone is advised to HODL and wait for Lightning to use it? Why the anti\-adoption narrative \(""Bitcoin doesn't need you, you need bitcoin. Wait or gtfo""\)?

&gt;Enough with the dishonesty. You aren't just pissing away your credibility, you're hurting Bitcoin Cash.

"&gt; But value determines the price

So was Enron a valuable company for all the years it had high share prices?

Price is determined by the _perception_ of value in the mind of the person buying it. True value is determined by its usefulness and scarcity. Bitcoin has no value as a payment system, because the blocksize is too small, and LN does not work (and is impractical). Therefore, Bitcoin has very little value. The argument that it is ""a store of value"" is ridiculous. Unfortunately, due to a [years long issue](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/informative_btc_vs_bch_articles/dl8v4lp/?st=jaotbt8m&amp;sh=222ce783), many people don't see it this way.",1525744697

* To achieve goal of STOPPING/slowing down Bitcoin (for a few/TPTB) ",1525744504
"This gets into price formation and how markets are made, it's complex.

Don't think of Bitcoin as a monolith. Think of it like this: 99% of Bitcoin are sitting still, in vaults. Only 1% are out moving around, being traded back and forth by people. That tiny 1% sets the price for the other 99% that's not moving. This is the case for all traded assets. The 1% are what's called ""liquid"", meaning they are available at any given moment.

So when you go to buy or sell BTC, you're adding your BTC you the liquid supply on the market, and someone else is waiting ready to buy them at a certain price. If you tell your broker ""don't sell my BTC until you can find someone willing to pay $10,000 per Bitcoin"", you're actively participating in price formation. But most people don't do this. Most people just buy and sell at whatever price happens to be clearing at that moment.",1525744454
"Yeah, that's a fair point, but that doesn't really aid the community. The idea is not only to reward companies that accept BTC, but also to convert others to the cause.

"An economy is the sum-total of people exchanging value. Those in the economy who get the new money first (loaned into existence) benefit by buying productive assets pre-inflation and profiting post inflation. 

Those people to earn new money last, earn pre-inflation and spend post inflation. This transfer of wealth is known as the Cantillon Effect.

It's a result of money creation. Where increasing the money supply affects relative inflation, or how a disproportionate rise in prices among different goods in an economy over time, will benefit those who are first to receive new money and diminish the wealth of those in the economy who experience inflation before earning the new money.  

**In an ever inflating economy the wealthy erode the wealth of savers.**

With a fixed money supply, this form of wealth transfer is circumvented. 

**In the absence of monetary inflation savers erode the wealth of the wealthy by saving**.

Amaury argued the case just fine but Jimmy wasn't listening, he was trying to win the argument.

I agree. I'm assuming you meant that Max Keiser video. Jimmy seemed drunk and was not doing a great job forming a cohesive argument. He was also going after low hanging fruit instead of tackling the bigger issue. Regardless, that's the only time I've seen Jimmy off his game.

To think crypto is speculative is wrong. It’s actually not speculation at all. I know that for example 1 Dash (alt coin) can be split into 100,000,000 different units, sent globally instantly for fees fractions of a penny. My personal funds cannot be traced or seized. I can access these funds 24/7 on any phone/laptop/ hardware that supports the coin. I could even create “paper wallets” worth small amounts to trade if it got to a point where there’s no tech around. That’s what I find valuable. 

Now to ask you. What can your fiat do? Can your fiat do anything I listed better? Anything? 1 dollar is only split into 100 units(100 pennies) sure you could fly across the globe to give your paper money to someone. Or you could use PayPal, and depending on the amount, you could be paying $100 on a large transaction($2000~) or just wire the money across the globe. Yet it will take 3-5 weeks to arrive with at least a $5 fee. Banks close around 6ish every weekday and are closed completely on Sunday. Your funds can be seized frozen and taken. Tell me there’s more value to your fiat then “everyone accepts it” because that’s the exact point I was trying to prove. The system will be replaced. ",1525742228
"The leading cause of failed startups is over engineering problems that are not actually there, and ignoring the most important ones. So much has to be learned along the way anyway, that you simply can't engineer that far ahead. This is especially true of bitcoin.

Instead the core dev team has been tinkering with imaginary problems for the last 3 years: ""increasing the blocksize is not a permanent solution, therefore LN!!"" . Meanwhile the coin is looking more terrible every day. The block reward 20 becoming small in 20 years is not a problem. Think of it like a company.

As I understand it so far, it's simply a tradable commodity that is purposefully devoid of real life value (as compared to gold for example which you can make jewelry out of), and therefore less susceptible to fluctuations due to those value aspects. 

I personally believe BTC is useful as a store of value in the abstract sense. Nothing more than a ledger. As a currency, I'm positive that there will be derivative tech that will be issued by whichever platform has the most users coming online, like FB or Apple or Chase or Visa grew to be standards over time simply by way of reaching the Tipping Point (see Malcom Gladwell).

I’m not 100% sure what the difference is (I didn’t create the chart, and I’m not affiliated with Bitcoin.com), but if I had to guess, my guess would be that that has to do with the ease of transacting with merchants... possibly even from the merchant’s point of view. Because of RBF (replace by fee), a merchant would typically not feel comfortable accepting a BTC transaction until at least one confirmation... which could take 10 minutes or 30 minutes or hours or days. Even from the consumer's point of view, having to wait an unspecified amount of time before you can actually receive the products that you just paid for can make it less transactable.

Clearly this was the work of r/btc sockpuppets trying to troll r/bitcoin.  A discussion of big blocks doesnt automatically mean support of BCH, I agree, but here it actually did.  

The big block argument is a dead issue, it's happened and it was rejected by the majority of the community and thats why there was a hard fork that produced BCH.

Bigger blocks do not solve the scaling issue.  Segwit and lightning will significantly increase the throughput of transactions and once we start packing blocks 100% and have no other options to make the code more efficient with how it records transactions, then we can entertain increasing block size.  I said that in my very first reply on r/bitcoin.

We're not there yet.  Nobody is packing blocks 100%.  Not even BCH.  Now that segwit has been implemented by more of the major providers, the fees have dropped and the backlog has been cleared.  That's simply from 35% of the community implementing one leg of the current scaling solutions.

You BCH supporters are the ones fraudulently marketing your coins.  Even you tried to pass off the Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin by saying its true because its a fork of the original Bitcoin genesis chain.  BCH is not Bitcoin.  It's a contentious hardfork the community rejected it.

"Trust me man, I've been swing trading on the fx market for 4 years. I've given my soul to understanding currencies. The fact of the matter is, all these cryptos are driven speculation. They have zero value. Fiat currency is supported by every business, resource, government, citizen, system, and structure that gives it value.

I used to really like Jimmy, now he irritates me with his patronising 'IT Development takes time guys, just be patient'. Many larger systems have been built in much less time that the 4+ years LN is taking.  I have also lost respect for him having watched the informal discussion with Amaury Sechet in some bar somewhere - Jimmy was trying to win the argument that bitcoin is the best store of value, skipping over the critical point that Amaury stated up front - that a currency has to be a means of exchange before it can be a store of value.

Disproof: Any trade has two parties, if a static number of money units discourages you from buying, then an increasing number of money units should discourage you from selling - it is the same proposition. 

But nobody sells anything in the current inflationary environment, are they? Nobody is selling houses, nobody is selling cars, nobody is selling food, huh?

It is neo keynesian hogwash, the man was confused, but the dominators liked him and put him on a pedestal, he worked for them!

In reality, money is speculation on what other people will do in the future - the market will adjust all prices including the coin price measured in houses - trade will continue.

Secondly, with an artificial fee market, you might never know when your transactions are going to go through or how much moving those transactions will cost in fees. It is completely unreliable, it could take days or weeks for a transaction to go through, it could cost hundreds of dollars for a transaction go through, or your transaction might get stuck permanently and never go through.

The second-biggest breach of a Bitcoin exchange platform, Bitfinex, caused 120,000 units of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, which was valued at $72 million at the time, to be stolen. Bitfinex first announced the security breach on August 2, 2016. The bitcoin was taken from users' segregated wallets and Bitfinex has been tracking down the hack. Significant hacker funds transactions were signed off by Bitfinex's security provider, without full security.

Oh and people always say “crypto is so volatile” the dollar is the safe haven because it isn’t. But think for a second and understand what causes stability? Stability is caused by trust in a system over a long period of time. But we hit a point where we no longer look at the system and we just trust. This becomes the downfall of fiat.

"&gt; In it's current state it can't even handle 1 million transactions or less daily

Bitcoin can handle about half a million transactions daily. Keep in mind that each Bitcoin transaction is a irreversible and final settlement. Once processed, the coin are fully under your control.

This is ofcourse unlike traditional bank transactions which can be reversed and worse, accounts can be frozen. Access to your own money is at the mercy of the bank and the government of the country it is in.

A Bitcoin transaction cannot be compared to a traditional bank transaction. They are fundamentally different. The powerful features of a Bitcoin transaction are achievable because the Bitcoin ledger has many copies that are forced to be in sync. No single person or group can tamper with the Bitcoin ledger.

This works as long as Bitcoin keeps many copies of its ledger, which makes it decentralized and therefore trustless. All the value of Bitcoin comes from it being trustless. If Bitcoin weren’t, it wouldn’t have any value. It simply cannot compete with traditional centralized systems that only need a single copy of their ledger.

Second layer solutions such as Lightning Network will offer off-chain scaling without compromising the decentralized properties of Bitcoin and thus without jeopardizing the one thing that gives it value: being trustless.",1525739619

3) Bitcoin is easier to store than gold (No need to bury it, or trust someone else to hold it)

4) Bitcoin is easier to divide than gold (No need for scales or chipping and re-melting)

The one area that gold has on bitcoin admittedly is it's stability, which is merely a function of it's global adoption as gold is valuable due to thousands of years of the network effect. it's market saturation is 100%. Whether or not you think bitcoin can reach global adoption will be the difference in whether you are a believer. Admittedly bitcoin COULD fail, and something else takes its place, but personally I don't see that happening. Bitcoin is the most trusted name in crypto, and one of the only ""projects"" in the space that I consider heavily undervalued (For the 4 ""superior than gold"" reasons stated above). That being said, I'll agree that some other crypto could take its place. My main argument is that gold's days are numbered. At least as king. Gold is still inherently valuable for electronics so gold will always have value, but I don't believe that in 1,000 years, gold will still be ""money"".",1525737610

In fact, Luke Jr has actually said he wants to reduce the blocksize to 300KBs. Time to get educated my friend.

&gt; I for one support increasing the block size limit on Bitcoin (BTC). Who's with me?

Why do you think Bitcoin Cash exists? Everyone here wanted to increase the blocksize, for years, going all the way back to Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn, first with Bitcoin XT, then with Bitcoin Unlimited, and finally (and successfully), with Bitcoin Cash. BTC has refused for about 5 years. Many of us have left BTC. More detailed history of this conflict here: [link 2](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/informative_btc_vs_bch_articles/dl8v4lp/?st=jaotbt8m&amp;sh=222ce783)",1525736667
I agree that it is more usable than bitcoin ,1525736641
"&gt; point to things BCH is developing to make it better than bitcoin on its own merits.

Things being discussed and/or worked on:

* adaptive block size

* removing ordering consensus and implementing canonical transaction ordering

* adding Gavin Andresen’s Graphene technology.

* sharding

* parallelized block validation

* improved Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm

* reactivate certain bitcoin-Opcodes that were deactivated in the past

* protocol extension points to facilitate future Opcode upgrades which could lead to developments like Colored Coins

That's the ABC devs.

This is the Unlimited devs:

* BU suggests to further increase capacity by decreasing block intervals to one, two, or 2.5 minutes.

* BU supports the reactivation of old opcodes but also proposes to implement new codes, like OP_GROUP or OP_DATASIGVERIFY, which could enable “representative token and binary contracts,” among other things

* BU wants to evaluate the implementation of “Bobtail,” which has the potential to “reduce inter-block time variance, increase double-spend resistance, improve the DDA, and achieve better mining,”

Among other things. All of the proposed BCH protocol upgrades are dependent on “further discussion, implementation, and testing.”

&gt;The Bitcoin developers are so good your so-called developers are stealing their code.

Being open source software, anything that is produced for any other coin, including by the Core devs, will probably be considered and tested, and if beneficial, will be included. Doing otherwise would be burying your face in the sand.

I don't hear you saying the Litecoin devs stole the Bitcoin code. Stop with this nonsense. It makes you look like you're in favor of closed development.

&gt;You cant name the scaling solution for BCH because it doesnt exist.

The scaling solution is to increase the blocksize, and optimize the code you efficiently use the hardware, as Satoshi intended. It's pretty simple.

&gt;There is a signficant lack of activity on the github

It's in many different places, and there are many different teams. This is where ABC is:

https://reviews.bitcoinabc.org/

https://github.com/Bitcoin-ABC/bitcoin-abc

And I believe that talk on telegram groups or something.

I think that Bill Gates and Warren Buffet(those types of people) haven't put alot of thought into cryptos. Why would they? They don't want to risk their billions to 100x it: that's too risky and pretty much impossible. What I'm trying to say is that the gut reaction from most financial experts/advisors/etc is that Bitcoin is a bubble because of how insane gains can be in this world. It's incompatible with what we know about investing in general, and I do think it's pretty indicative of the bubble cryptos are in right now. But yes, I agree with you that blockchain and cryptos in general are revolutionary, and will definitely get to Trillions+ marketcap in a way that actually represents their value accurately, not in the current environment based off hype, marketing, and vaporware.",1525735181

Dash is exactly the same, except the tax is split three ways. Beyond a certain optimal point where the network is secure enough, it becomes wasteful to spend more money on security / miners. All Dash has done is to redirect that excess tax money to places where it has a more beneficial effect (funding developers and community projects, and paying masternodes so they upgrade their hardware when required).",1525734921

With regards to the bubble, I think you can see small bubbles forming and bursting on a much faster cycle than traditional markets. The way I look at investing is that I believe in the potential of blockchain as a new way of storing, organising and communicating data safely without intermediaries. We've barely scratched the surface of how that can be applied to the real world to reinvent, democratise and streamline all kinds of industries. I can't do fundamental analysis of a token because there's no way to map the majority of features to the real world. I can however intuit that I believe cryptocurrency as a whole has a long way to grow in the mid to late term, and I can make a judgement on how one token or coin compares to the others around it. That's enough for me to risk what I can afford to lose in order to be a part of something exciting, and ride that wave",1525734739

Wrong. The consensus stuck with BTC. Not sure how you're getting such a simple fact wrong. Look at the hashing power between the two networks. BTC is Bitcoin.

&gt;If you make unfounded claims I will ask you for sources. This is how this works. You lie and I call you out on it. This here is a lie that you cannot back up.

I gave you sources and you disputed them. I disagreed. Move on from this point already.

&gt;BCash is already taken. Bitcoin has been around for a while. It wasn't until recently that people decided to change it into something else and now we are debating about which fork gets the name.

I'm confused, what are you referring to as BCash?

&gt;Lol. You may think it is a better name but it is not it's name. Most people do not refer to it as BCash, but it seems most sock puppets do.

Source? SOURCES? Show me the source where most people don't call it BCash! Everyone I look on twitter and reddit people call it BCash. So this is it's natural name. WHERE IS YOUR PROOF?

&gt;No it really isn't up in the air. The do not know anyone involved in the project that calls it that name.

Doesn't matter. We're talking about the name that the majority of people refer to it as. Not even sure why you're arguing such a stupid point anyway. Who cares what people call it? The tech should stand on its own. It shouldn't need some sort of special branding package to survive.

Are you really this ignorant. You honestly think ""Bitcoin Core"" refers to the Bitcoin network. God, dude. Read a book or [something](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Clients). Only complete ignoramuses and shills make the mistake of calling Bitcoin, Bitcoin Core.


&gt;You know it is. Most people in the community do not like the name and you use it to try to provoke them and also to remove Bitcoin from the name.

Oh yeah, you can totally read my mind and intentions, right? Wrong. I already told you I like the name better and the vast majority of people in the space refer to it as BCash. Sorry you don't like it but this is the colloquial term for the project.

&gt;Is it facist to ask people not to call you an idiot? Can I refer to you as a dumbass for the rest of this conversation?

How is that an accurate comparison? BCash is not a slur and it's the name everyone uses. It's actually a catching name too. If I were shilling BCash I would be very happy to call it by this name. How is it a slur? Sources? DO YOU HAVE SOURCES?
 
&gt;Not long ago, most people called black people niggers. Does that make it not a slur. Your logic is bad.

That term refers to *people*, human beings, not pieces of software. Also, do you not see how there's no negative connotation for the term BCash? Only shills are upset that it's not referred to as Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash. Other than that there's absolutely no problem. But again, it's referring to a blockchain, not a group of people based on their skin color. It's amazing to me that you can't see the distinction.

"&gt; Back in 2010 there was plenty of (needed) development taking place, so the likelihood of bugs being introduced was high. Now in 2018, needed development has slowed down completely. The only thing that is changing these days are things that don't need to change at all, like cashaddr and those new opcodes.

Cashaddr format is specifically to prevent people from making mistakes sending BTC to BCH addresses and vice versa.  It is absolutely necessary.

Regardless, you're using your own opinions about what constitutes necessary and what doesn't.  You are making claims about objective truth using nothing but subjective views as backing for that claim.  That is not a sound argument.

&gt; Unfortunately the reality of the situation is that many people believe that changing the code in the name of ""innovation"" will help the price, so pointless changes like cashaddr and the new opcodes are hyped up by investors which encourages ""devs"" to continue making pointless changes after pointless change. These changes may introduce more bugs for no benefit other than give people hope that the new ""innovation"" will pump the price.

And then on top of that, you're making up the intentions of others out of thin air and then using that straw man against them.  Don't lose sight of the argument you're trying to make here.  Your argument is 1) one implementation is better than multiple, and 2) it is relatively easy to write bug-free code as long as you don't change it later.  My rebuttal against the first of those is my first reply to you, and my rebuttal against the second is my other reply to you.  It is NOT easy to write bug-free code.  It is in fact almost impossible, since even if your code is good, other factors may cause the code execution to have bugs.

&gt; Bugs in software is not like mold on a bread that just appears instantaneously. Someone has to change something in working code in order for a bug to appear.

That's just not true.  The hardware can be faulty, the compiler may use libraries with subtle differences.  There's worlds of outside influences like that that you have no control over, and that's assuming that your code is bug-free to begin with, which it's not.  So, what are you going to do?  Run it in exactly the same environment?  Never get updates?  Let kernel exploits that are discovered just stay on your internet-connected machine?

Like it or not, your environment will change, and your software will change with it, even if its subtle.  Bugs that have never popped up before will pop up.  Shit will happen.  That's how life goes.

&gt; There are altcoins that haven't had a single code change since 2013 that still operate perfectly as a store of value and a payment network today as they did in 2013.

That's not an argument that coins *shouldn't* get upgrades though, that's simply an argument that says they don't need to.  And your argument that they shouldn't is so far based solely on the idea that upgrades will introduce bugs, and of course the greatest mitigation for that -- multiple implementations -- you refuse to use.  What you need to make your case is a reason aside from bugs why it's inherently wrong to perform upgrades when there is near complete consensus for them.

&gt; Its possible to make a change to working software in such a way that the change is impossible to screw up.

No, it's not.  You keep saying that and it's just not true.  That's not how software works.  This is one of those ""in theory, practice and theory are the same, but in practice....."" situations.

&gt; It's absolutely impossible to mess up changing a 1 to a 2, no matter how mentally retarded you are.

This is a perfect example of how wrong you are.  An example: if you're using database software which handles blobs of a certain size in one way, and blobs of another size in a different way, changing that one to a two can cause unexpected behavior.  Another example:  You have some kind of mathematical formula that takes into account that 1, and when you change it to 2, that formula causes an integer overflow.

Now, if you had multiple different implementations that all changed that 1 to a 2, and only one of them had problems with that change, you might be ok...... but I may have made this point already.....

&gt; On the other hand, it is very possible to mess up implementing bech32/cashaddr because those changes are very complex. If all you're doing is changing a number, then it's bug proof. If you're adding complex code then even the smartest developers may make a mistake. In my opinion, the only changes to Bitcoin that should ever be made are changes to the numbers.

We are in agreement about the dangers of complexity.  Where we disagree is on the mitigations.  I think the ability to upgrade when necessary is important, and thus I prefer the mitigation of multiple implementations.  You think locking the code down is a better choice.  I disagree with that, but to each his own.  My big issue is that you think it's possible to lock down *bug free* code.  And it's just not.  No code is bug free.

&gt; Multiple implementations probably helps the lightning network more than BCH because the LN is still under heavy development. BCH shouldn't be under heavy development, as the core idea that BCH operates under (the white paper) hasn't changed in many years.

Multiple implementations help alpha software just as much as old stable software.  Because they don't protect *software*, they protect *protocols*.  Multiple implementations ensure that a *protocol* continues to function correctly across an entire distributed system, even if a single software implementation of that protocol has bugs.",1525732798

BCH doesnt have developers working on anything you can point to.  The best developers are working on Bitcoin and its been that way since the beginning.  The Bitcoin developers are so good your so-called developers are stealing their code.

You cant name the scaling solution for BCH because it doesnt exist.  There is a signficant lack of activity on the github and little to no effort being made to show what projects you have in development that will make BCH better.

I sure as fuck didnt want to get proselytized by your phony bullshit of the prophet Satoshi and his ""vision"". 

The volume demanded it a long time ago.

&gt;Satoshi probably thinks your a gullible fucking idiot.

He dead.

&gt; There are no full BCH blocks. The average block size is 620k since the fork. Bigger blocks never was a solution for scaling. It was a stopgap option and not a true solution. It simply kicked the can down the road. What is the BCH plan for scaling? Even bigger blocks?

It is *the* solution, as it always has been. Are you saying that the hardware cannot handle bigger blocks? Because that is the biggest r/bitcoin fallacy.

&gt; Yes, Coinbase running a bunch of transactions on chain was also creating spam. That disappeared after they implemented segwit and they saved money they were burning by eating the transfer fees off GDAX. The fees dropped as most of the major exchanges implemented segwit. That's simply a fact.

Which came first? Increased percentage of Segwit transactions, or decreased total amount of transactions?

&gt; Again, there is plenty of information in r/bitcoin showing logs of spam transactions from the same addresses and even chat logs from one of the offenders who was doing it.

Then produce them!

&gt; This community has nothing to do with free thought. The sub r/btc is a fraud in itself. There is only discussion about Bitcoin Cash, not Bitcoin. It's one component in a host of bitcoin branded channels that Roger has hijacked to make fraudulent claims about Bitcoin Cash being the real Bitcoin. This is a toxic community that censors anyone who has the temerity to point out that fraud.

Nobody is being censored. Intentional spammers get banned, that's it. You're still here, aren't you?

&gt; r/bitcoin is a moderated channel that discusses bitcoin. Not bitcoin cash. If you wanna bring up bitcoin cash or the big block arguments, you will get banned because the subject matter is off topic. That's not censorship, that's moderation. If you want a broader sub to make your bullshit claims and exchange thoughts on a variety of different cryptos, big blocks, small blocks, side chain or on chain transactions, go to cryptocurrency.

Big block arguments aren't exclusive to BCH. /cryptocurrency is run by nearly the same people.

&gt; ""Our leaders"" didnt make a mistake by not increasing the block size. They made the smart choice by trying to optimize the code to take deal with blocks more efficiently. That is actually a scaling solution. You guys have no such solution. 

What is Graphene?

&gt;The only thing you can talk about is censorship because you have no projects in development worth promoting that solves the issue of scaling at all. ""Our leaders"" are doing such a great job your developers are ripping off the code changes ""our leaders"" originally implemented.

And your leaders are just as busy yelling ""BCASH"" ""ROGER"" ""SCAM"" everywhere.

At least even you recognize the difference, BCH has developers, BTC has thought leaders.

&gt; I agree with your assessment. Bitcoin would be doing much better if you assholes never forked in the first place to protect a mining cartel and a convicted felon named Roger Ver. Oh fuckin well. I guess you'll continue supporting Roger camping on Bitcoin.com, r/btc and @bitcoin making fraudulent claims like bitcoin cash is the real bitcoin trying to steal the brand of bitcoin instead of focusing on why Bitcoin Cash is better.

You guys have nearly the same damn miners! They make even more money from your (at times) exorbitant fees! Jihan supports Core! Antpool actually burns a small percentage of the fees they mine on BCH, intentionally!

We wouldn't be in this position if Core had stuck to the Hong Kong Agreement.

&gt; I agree, the users who supported big blocks run ABC and hold BCH. The fact is the majority still run core and hold BTC. When you forked, the majority of the community did not cross over and almost a year later still have not accepted your shitcoin. The community, through consensus, rejected it.

Because the majority of the /bitcoin community came on the scene in 2017. This is obvious based on price. BCH right now is the price of BTC one year ago. The censorship and lies of /bitcoin/Core/Blockstream will only work for so long before the damn breaks. Be prepared.

2. Almost every society in history has had demand for precious metals. Maybe it's something inherent about humans, but regardless because we've been using gold and other precious metals for so long, it stands to reason they have value from a human perspective.
3. Finite earthly limit, can't be replicated. No other metal has exactly the same supply as Gold, the same properties(chemically), and it can be easily identified. 
4. Nobody is saying if you invest in Gold it will become $100,000/oz in 10 years.

Bitcoin:
1. New investment. Innovative technology that hasn't been breached for 8 years, but there's no guarantee it will be safe in the next 30-40 years. Can technically be used as a store of value. A good use case, but not a proven one. Still speculative.
2. Demand is coming in, yes, but Bitcoin is new and has just recently reached sort-of ""mainstream"" status. 
3. Finite supply, but easily reproducable system. You can make another Bitcoin easily(in terms of the system). There's nothing unique about Bitcoin other than that it has the largest hash rate of any other POW cryptocurrency. 
4. There are alot of investors saying Bitcoin will be 1 million + in 10 years. That speaks to a bubble-like mentality, and if it looks like a duck and talks like a duck, it's probably a duck.

Gold has a history of maintaining value, regardless of circumstances and culture. It's time-proven, which Bitcoin isn't. Maybe people will adopt it and it will moon, don't get me wrong. I think blockchain + cryptocurrencies in general will be huge given time, but right now, I think values are inflated by #4 moonboys.",1525731849

"It’s weird how no-one has properly answered your question yet. 

BTC only has the Blockstream development team in charge of it. You could call this centralized development. Bitcoin Cash on the other hand has multiple independent teams of developers. Here’s a few: Bitcoin Unlimited, Parity Bitcoin, Bitcoin XT, nChains, Bitcoin ABC, Bitprim, Bitcrust, etc. It’s unlikely that all of these development teams could be simultaneously have interests that aren’t in line with the people using it. 

I don’t know if it’s right to say BTC has been infiltrated by bankers, but here’s what we know: 
Blockstream agreed to increase the block size to 2mb as well as activate segwit in the Hong Kong consensus agreement. They activated segwit but didn’t increase the block size. There is no good technological reason not to increase the block size at least that much, even by their doctrine. They have some reason that they want the fees to stay high, that’s the only reason this action makes sense.

Enter the lightning networking, an inconvenient bizarre system (have a watch of the videos by decentralized thought) that they happen to be able to profit from. And they openly say Blockstream works for profit. Here’s a very short badly edited clip showing that (I’ll try to find a better source): https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cFOmUm-_DMQ

You probably get the idea at this point. There’s so much to learn is this debate. I think fees will rise again, people will realize lightning is inconvenient and not what they signed up for. Who can say what will happen at that point ",1525731584

"&gt; How do naming conventions work with open source projects? Who gets to decide the name?

Consensus. Colloquialism. Markets. Hashing Power.

&gt;Bitcoin refers to the chain defined by a white paper. This whitepaper describes P2P cash, not a settlement layer that requires middlemen. I think it describes the Bitcoin Cash chain, and not the Bitcoin Core chain. I can back this up with actual evidence, not simple musings.

Lol, you're taking the subtext of the paper and extrapolating an unbelievably great deal from that. Either way, your shit stinks. Segwit processes more TXs ON CHAIN than BCH does. Try harder.

&gt;Let's stop with the games. You know what I am referring to. Bitcoin Core is a reference client and a fork of the original Bitcoin chain. It currently uses the ticker symbol BTC.

Lol, what? Do really not understand what Bitcoin Core is and how it's different from Bitcoin? You seem massively uninformed on this topic in particular.

&gt;Here is another lie. Universal is a very big percentage. Hate is a strong word. What evidence do you have that he is universally hated? I personally do not know anyone who hates him. Can you prove this unfounded claim?

The proof is in the pudding. Look at Twitter. Look at what all the prominent developers say about him. Look at reddit. I don't owe you a fucking meta-analysis of these communication channels. 

&gt;Now isn't this funny. You don't like me calling Bitcoin Core Bitcoin Core, but you see nothing wrong with calling Bitcoin Cash BCash.

Bitcoin refers to something already in existence. It's a name that's already taken. BCash and Bitcoin Cash are names that are not reserved for anything else. I happen to think BCash is a much catchier name and it seems that most people refer to it as such. If 'Bitcoin Cash' becomes the standard name then I have no problem using that. For right now it seems up in the air, if not leaning towards BCash. Do you honestly not see the difference here? I'm not deceiving anyone into buying the wrong asset by calling it BCash.

&gt;Have you never lost your temper? You have so much hate. This is really not healthy for you.

I've lost my temper and I've apologized for outbursts when I'm in the wrong. All Roger did was put the blame outside himself.

&gt;That network is also called Bitcoin Core. Calling it Bitcoin Core makes alot of sense when you realize how much the project has diverged from Bitcoin.

Lmao. No it doesn't. That makes no sense. Core is not the only client that runs on Bitcoin. Your argument makes absolutely no sense. Please at least put more effort into these specious claims, if you insist on making them.

&gt;I am not trying to make a compelling case. We are discussing your lies not which is and is not Bitcoin. I find it really funny how you are now using slurs to refer to the project though.

What? What slurs? BCash is a slur? Lmao. Most people refer to it as BCash and it's a catchy name. How is that a slur? I'm just using its colloquial name. I thought that's how these naming conventions work. Or am I supposed to just listen to fascists like Roger who insist I use the name that *they* prefer? Like I said, either name is open for use and BCash seems to be the preferred term in the space. Almost everyone on reddit outside of this sub seems to be calling it BCash. How can that be a slur?

The free market has decided on bitcoin's price, but current economic thinking tells us that there's a way to calculate inherent value of a security. Bitcoin acts much more like a security than a currency. Though we can't use the same metrics, but we can ask a simple question: **is Bitcoin being used enough to actually warrant a $10000 price? Is there enough demand for Bitcoin as a CURRENCY, not an investment to justify that price?**. I would argue no. Not very many places take Bitcoin, and most demand for Bitcoin is as an investment rather than a currency. That means you think price will go up not because adoption drives the price, but because someone else will buy it from you higher at a later point.

That's a cheap hot Alt right there in the making folks. Pizza coin promises to introduce the pizza to Blockchain supply chain management.

Again, you made the claim bitcoin users wanted larger blocks and I said if they did theyd be running ABC and holding BCH and they arent.  They are running core and holding BTC.  Your argument is based on a flawed premise you cant actually prove.

My definition of working is people using it and it working.  Lightning is working even though its still in beta.  It's not vaporware, you can, just like Roger has, try it for yourself.

I didnt want some ""good ole fashion debate"" where you call me into your shitshow to spray a firehose of bullshit at me with all your failed narratives about the great prophet Satoshi and the dastardly conspiratorial deeds of blockchain.  This staretd with one of your dumbass trolls trying to rehash the big block argument in a post on r/bitcoin and me saying we support large blocks once we've reached the point lightning and segwit are scaled and the volume demands it because there are no other solutions to optimize the code using 1mb blocks.  I sure as fuck didnt want to get proselytized by your phony bullshit of the prophet Satoshi and his ""vision"".  Satoshi probably thinks your a gullible fucking idiot.

There are no full BCH blocks.  The average block size is 620k since the fork.  Bigger blocks never was a solution for scaling.  It was a stopgap option and not a true solution.  It simply kicked the can down the road.  What is the BCH plan for scaling?  Even bigger blocks?

Yes, Coinbase running a bunch of transactions on chain was also creating spam.  That disappeared after they implemented segwit and they saved money they were burning by eating the transfer fees off GDAX.  The fees dropped as most of the major exchanges implemented segwit.  That's simply a fact.

Again, there is plenty of information in r/bitcoin showing logs of spam transactions from the same addresses and even chat logs from one of the offenders who was doing it.

This community has nothing to do with free thought.  The sub r/btc is a fraud in itself.  There is only discussion about Bitcoin Cash, not Bitcoin.  It's one component in a host of bitcoin branded channels that Roger has hijacked to make fraudulent claims about Bitcoin Cash being the real Bitcoin.  This is a toxic community that censors anyone who has the temerity to point out that fraud.

r/bitcoin is a moderated channel that discusses bitcoin.  Not bitcoin cash.  If you wanna bring up bitcoin cash or the big block arguments, you will get banned because the subject matter is off topic.  That's not censorship, that's moderation.  If you want a broader sub to make your bullshit claims and exchange thoughts on a variety of different cryptos, big blocks, small blocks, side chain or on chain transactions, go to cryptocurrency.  

""Our leaders"" didnt make a mistake by not increasing the block size.  They made the smart choice by trying to optimize the code to take deal with blocks more efficiently.  That is actually a scaling solution.  You guys have no such solution.  The only thing you can talk about is censorship because you have no projects in development worth promoting that solves the issue of scaling at all.  ""Our leaders"" are doing such a great job your developers are ripping off the code changes ""our leaders"" originally implemented.

I agree with your assessment.  Bitcoin would be doing much better if you assholes never forked in the first place to protect a mining cartel and a convicted felon named Roger Ver.  Oh fuckin well.  I guess you'll continue supporting Roger camping on Bitcoin.com, r/btc and @bitcoin making fraudulent claims like bitcoin cash is the real bitcoin trying to steal the brand of bitcoin instead of focusing on why Bitcoin Cash is better.

I agree, the users who supported big blocks run ABC and hold BCH.  The fact is the majority still run core and hold BTC.  When you forked, the majority of the community did not cross over and almost a year later still have not accepted your shitcoin.  The community, through consensus, rejected it.

The bots and shills are manufactured here in this fucked up subreddit called r/btc where bitcoin is trashed and bitcoin cash is hyped.

"Gosh man length does not add credibility to your posts.

Could you please provide proof that BlockPress was announced prior to Memo? Otherwise this is lie.

By claiming that different protocols adds decentralization you just prove you don’t understand nor what decentralization means nor what makes a social network strong.

Consider Bitcoin.  If it’s adopted around the globe it forms a strong network effect and most people are willing to use it. Bitcoin was on the right direction, but because of extremely bad management this effect is gone now, and Bitcoin Cash is trying to catch up. 

Having different implementation of the same protocol is socially healthy (though in case of blockchain mechanics this is questionable, especially if we consider purely technical point of view).

Having different protocols is socially unhealthy, as every one is somewhat forced to participate in many networks. Look at email — this is one of the oldest high-level protocol that was built on top of internet protocol, it gained momentum and every one uses it these days. There are different interoperable implementations that forms the global network. XMPP is very similar to email, though due to purely business reasons it was abandoned and every big company that supported it (including Google and Apple) started to build their own protocols, so we now have WhatsApp, iMessage, around six different messengers from Google, WeChat, Telegram, Line etc. And all of these protocols are almost pure copies of XMPP that forms many non-interoperable networks. THIS IS BAD, AND SOCIETY DOES NOT PROFIT FROM THIS — ONLY BIG COMPANIES DO.

This is exactly the same situation right now. BlockPress tries to ride the hype that was created by Memo. Their protocol is very similar and there is no sane reason basic functions such as ‘follow’ ‘post’ etc cannot be identical. They had two choices 1. Make an independent implementation of the Memo protocol and increase its robustness. 2. Copy the protocol and dissolve network effect around Memo. They have chosen the second one, I am 100% sure there are business reasons behind.

I bet BlockPress will never find their home here in Bitcoin community, and the only reasonable choice is to release their work as independent implementation, not as an ‘independent’ protocol.",1525730141

"&gt;Transaction on BCH chain are steadily increasing since the release of Memo and Blockpress.

[No they aren't](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactions-bch.html)

&gt;Yes, due to reasons stated. Questioning again and refuting an argument are different things..

The numbers don't lie.

&gt;From what I can tell, over the past couple weeks the market did flock to BCH. At least more than they did to BTC.

What? BCH is still way down from ATH ratio and well below 1/5th the value of Bitcoin. Also, AGAIN, look at the transactions and transaction value charts. What you're claiming is not represented by the data.

&gt;But it is, we are growing. More tx per block than before is growth.

Again, where are you getting these data from?

&gt;You don't have to be an asshole. I'm just being honest, i'm not a developer - but that doesn't mean that I can't understand some of these things. This space is going to need much more than developers to thrive.

Fair enough. Apologies.

&gt;Literally everything is down from its ATH. But every other time BCH, BTC or any of the other top 5 coins have dropped below an ATH before they crush it later on. That was my point.

I'm saying the *ratio* is well below ATH, not just the fiat pairings.

&gt;Because the community in general is still hyped on a failing coin. BTC isn't what it once was. Its been crippled in order to put money in the hands of different people. And/or to run it into the ground. I'm not sure exactly yet. But my eyes and ears will remain open.

See this is just such nonsense. This is BCH propaganda. Segwit alone is outperforming all BCH transactions and yet you're claiming that it's stalled? LN is up and running and you're claiming that BTC is crippled? Come on, this argument makes no sense, it's just an attempt to make BCH look like it's better positioned to grow, when in reality, it's not.

&gt;Check out this video

and look into these articles - massive disinformation and censorship campaign that's been waged on r/bitcoin for over two years now. And if you already have and you still think the way you do then we're at a standstill and no more can be done for our conversation.

Lol wut? The Molyneux video? Are you for real? He never said anything about Blockstream, the guy is ignorant on virtually everything in the space, he's a white supremacist and a hack. He's selling a brand to youtubers and his followers, nothing more, nothing less. 

In terms of censorship on /r/bitcoin. You're greatly overstating the issue and you seem to equate moderation with censorship, which is playing very loose with terms. The John Blocke article has been refuted many times, just look at the comments below the article. Again, this confusion with conflating 'censorship' with *moderation* needs to end. /r/Bitcoin is a place to discuss Bitcoin, not alts. The moderators make sure that's the case. 

&gt;When the LN is actually reliable and is actually used on the scale of the rest of the crypto world I may agree with you, but until then it's ""just hype"". Sound familiar? haha

It literally just launched beta clients. It's already up and running and working great. Networks like these grow organically, they don't turn full scale overnight. Not sure what more you can ask for in this regard. 

&gt;I think discussion is a good thing and I appreciate your point of view but I do see things differently. I'm sorry if I offended you along the way, as it was not my intention.

You didn't offend me. What offends me is the downvote brigade that ensues in this sub for anyone that questions the viability of BCH. Most people here don't want an honest discussion, they just want to spread propaganda and downvote anyone that stands up and states the obvious. Not saying you're doing this, but a vast majority of users here are instituting their own vigilante censorship campaign, even though the sidebar clearly says free and open discussion related to ""Bitcoin,"" which is undoubtedly BTC, not BCH at this point in time. The sub is called rBTC, FFS. Yet most here are just BCH shills and anything that goes against the narrative is instantly attacked, without reason.

Besides the aforementioned poker code, there are a few things like these:

&gt; The nature of Bitcoin is such that once version 0.1 was released, the core design was set in stone for the rest of its lifetime.  Because of that, I wanted to design it to support every possible transaction type I could think of.  The problem was, each thing required special support code and data fields whether it was used or not, and only covered one special case at a time.  It would have been an explosion of special cases.  The solution was script, which generalizes the problem so transacting parties can describe their transaction as a predicate that the node network evaluates.  The nodes only need to understand the transaction to the extent of evaluating whether the sender's conditions are met.
&gt;
&gt; The script is actually a predicate.  It's just an equation that evaluates to true or false.  Predicate is a long and unfamiliar word so I called it script.
&gt;
&gt; The receiver of a payment does a template match on the script.  Currently, receivers only accept two templates: direct payment and bitcoin address.  Future versions can add templates for more transaction types and nodes running that version or higher will be able to receive them.  All versions of nodes in the network can verify and process any new transactions into blocks, even though they may not know how to read them.
&gt;
&gt; The design supports a tremendous variety of possible transaction types that I designed years ago.  Escrow transactions, bonded contracts, third party arbitration, multi-party signature, etc.  If Bitcoin catches on in a big way, these are things we'll want to explore in the future, but they all had to be designed at the beginning to make sure they would be possible later.

electronic currency in some way, now that we know a way to do it
that won't inevitably get dumbed down when the trusted third party
gets cold feet.
&gt;
&gt; It could get started in a narrow niche like reward points,
donation tokens, currency for a game or micropayments for adult
sites. Initially it can be used in proof-of-work applications
for services that could almost be free but not quite.
&gt;
&gt; It can already be used for pay-to-send e-mail. The send dialog is
resizeable and you can enter as long of a message as you like.
It's sent directly when it connects. The recipient doubleclicks
on the transaction to see the full message. If someone famous is
getting more e-mail than they can read, but would still like to
have a way for fans to contact them, they could set up Bitcoin and
give out the IP address on their website. ""Send X bitcoins to my
priority hotline at this IP and I'll read the message personally.""
&gt;
&gt; Subscription sites that need some extra proof-of-work for their
free trial so it doesn't cannibalize subscriptions could charge
bitcoins for the trial.
&gt; 
&gt; It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on. If
enough people think the same way, that becomes a self fulfilling
prophecy. Once it gets bootstrapped, there are so many
applications if you could effortlessly pay a few cents to a
website as easily as dropping coins in a vending machine.

&gt; Forgot to add the good part about micropayments.  While I don't think Bitcoin is practical for smaller micropayments right now, it will eventually be as storage and bandwidth costs continue to fall.  If Bitcoin catches on on a big scale, it may already be the case by that time.  Another way they can become more practical is if I implement client-only mode and the number of network nodes consolidates into a smaller number of professional server farms.  Whatever size micropayments you need will eventually be practical.  I think in 5 or 10 years, the bandwidth and storage will seem trivial.
&gt;
&gt; I am not claiming that the network is impervious to DoS attack.  I think most P2P networks can be DoS attacked in numerous ways.  (On a side note, I read that the record companies would like to DoS all the file sharing networks, but they don't want to break the anti-hacking/anti-abuse laws.)
&gt;
&gt; If we started getting DoS attacked with loads of wasted transactions back and forth, you would need to start paying a 0.01 minimum transaction fee.  0.1.5 actually had an option to set that, but I took it out to reduce confusion.  Free transactions are nice and we can keep it that way if people don't abuse them.

It should be noted that this last one was from quite a long time ago, back when Bitcoin had a very low price so the now ridiculously high 0.01 fee suggested there was actually worth a lot less back then; and in regards to free transactions in specific, he has also said this:


&gt; Another option is to reduce the number of free transactions allowed per block before transaction fees are required.  Nodes only take so many KB of free transactions per block before they start requiring at least 0.01 transaction fee.
&gt;
&gt; The threshold should probably be lower than it currently is.
&gt;
&gt; I don't think the threshold should ever be 0.  We should always allow at least some free transactions.

"&gt;He believes BCH is Bitcoin. He backs up that claim with actual evidence. Bitcoin is not owned by any corporation or entity, so I see nothing unethical about having opinions about which project is Bitcoin.

Because this is not how naming conventions work. You don't just start mixing up names when it benefits you, especially in regards to traded assets with real monetary value. Bitcoin refers to the network and the chain, not Roger's musings. He is being purposefully deceptive to get people to buy BCH when they think they're buying Bitcoin.

Fruthermore, what is this ""Bitcoin Core"" that you keep referring to? Bitcoin Core is a software client, it's not Bitcoin. Not sure how many times I have to explain this to you. Calling Bitcoin, Bitcoin Core, makes no sense because there are other clients that operate on the network, which, again, is called Bitcoin.

Defend Roger's behavior all you want. There's a reason why this guy is nearly universally-hated in the space. He gets mad when people don't call BCash by the name he wants and flips them off and throws a temper tantrum. He's manipulative, deceptive and refuses to acknowledge any of his misgivings. He always blames someone else for his mistakes or writes them off as no big deal.

You didn't strike a nerve, you didn't adequately defend Roger or any of his actions and you didn't make a compelling case for why Bitcoin is actually ""Bitcoin Core"" and BCash is actually ""Bitcoin"". Good luck with this project, seriously, but I hope you learn a valuable lesson at some point about Roger's integrity and his tendency to poison everything he touches. ",1525728834

"There is likely a lot of misunderstanding on everyone's part. I am under the impression that Buffet/Gates think all of crypto is useless turds, not just Bitcoin. Maybe I am wrong and you can provide some clarification.

I tend to agree that Bitcoin is the least exciting thing about crypto based assets, and it's future is moderately promising, but not nearly as much as other applications. 

Can the greater fool's model be applied to fiat as well? Fiat is equivalent to a coin with no max supply and devs who continually exit scam, but yet we all put it on a pedestal as the most desirable asset. What is the intrinsic value of that cotton/linen fabric in your pocket with dead presidents on it? Does it have value because we trust in the Federal Reserve for some reason? My thinking is that we trust in the federal reserve because we have no other option. Cryptocurrency is now a new option, and while it is definitely not perfect, it could indeed have use as a way to diversify your assets instead of the ""In Fed We Trust"" fiat model.

I do agree this is currently a long bull market that makes everyone seem like an expert trader, eager to buy the next shiny thing. That will change with the inflow of institutional traders and funding. Joe Crypto is about to get 'rekt' when Goldman Sachs starts a trading desk. 

There will be fortunes made in finding quality projects that can survive the coming years, but I have no idea what that project is. Did anyone think Amazon was going to be the monster powerhouse it was when it started? Buffet surely didn't:

"The problem with this is WSJ literally reported the facts. There was a private meeting involving several relevant people on which one of the topics of conversation was crypto and securities. That's all they said.

It was the uninformed masses that thought this meant an official hearing and declaration.

So, in your example, the story would have been 'verified'


Furthermore I really don't think this would work because why would anyone in that meeting feel the need to take time out of their day and confirm/deny every one of those stories. You might suggest they would be 'rewarded' but that would lead to a host of other problems:

a) in group events such as this, who gets rewarded?

b) wouldn't this lead to corruption? Media companies promising more articles that the politician can 'verify' in return for favours?

c) how big are these rewards anyway? Anyone worth listening to isn't going to bother with anything less than a significant amount of money due to the hassle and additional PR issues. Who's paying these rewards?

d) who do you determine as an authoritative source? If there's anything you should have learnt from the last year's news in the US, it's that literally everything has 2 sides or spins on it. 

e) what about the minefield that would be checking that EVERYTHING in an article is correct before verifying it? A good bit of journalism may not be completely favourable to the person they're writing about. Therefore in order to become a 'verified' article they may have to censor or promote certain ideas",1525728412
"Channels can be funded by one side.  Lightning allows for instant settlement, so if you receive 100 satoshis you can immediately turn around and spend them somewhere else on Lightning.

Also, of course, Lightning transactions aren't limited by the base chain so you can have thousands of transactions per second or more.  Scales with more CPU or lower latency between the links, but it's just packed on the wire.

Even if those two things aren't enough to entice you, Lightning can atomically swap between compatible cryptocurrencies.  So you could swap X Bitcoin for Y Litecoin using nothing but a cooperating Lightning node.  This kind of swap is **atomic**, which means either the whole trade completes or everyone keeps their coins.  There's no way someone could do half of the trade and get away with it.",1525728406

You need to provide proof it’s just “normies” or you could troll through the archive of r/bitcoin where the logs are posted showing the same offending addresses spamming the network.

Oh, so it was spam because they didn't implement Segwit? That's a new argument.

&gt; Segwits being implemented. It’s at 35% and it’s drastically reduced fees so much you can’t even make an argument about it anymore.

How can you say fees have gone down because of Segwit and not because of BTC being used less than it was before?

&gt; Where are those full blocks of BCH you cited? Not seeing them.

Interesting, I didn't mention full BCH blocks, but they're out there:

&gt; Yes you’re part of a cult that elevates Satoshi to “prophet” status. Your community pathologically lies and misrepresents both bitcoin and bitcoin cash and you condone it.

I don't intentionally lie or misrepresent anything, and if you find that I have, let me know and i'll correct my error. I comment in a community where free thought doesn't get you banned. Sometimes that attracts unsavory people, but for the most part these are good people. The same could be said of BTC supporters.

&gt; As far as your conspiracy regarding blockchain go sling that shit in r/conspiracy because random character assassinations don’t pass muster. Mark Karpeles, the guy Roger vouched for as MtGox went down in flames hasn’t been in the space for years. Again it was Roger who tried to tell the community everything was just ducky.

Everybody makes mistakes, I'm waiting for your leaders to realize they made a mistake arbitrarily constricting the blocksize. Bitcoin Cash and many other coins wouldn't exist, and you BTC would be worth a hell of a lot more if they didn't make that mistake. Which is worse? Someone who has apologized for their mistake of trusting someone, or a group that continues to deny they ever made a mistake in the first place?

&gt; You guys are a fucking cult that lies and commits fraud shamelessly. Market on your strengths not on misinformation and fraudulent representation.

Strengths: Cash for all.

Weaknesses: Vast campaign of bots and shills that smear BCH.

&gt; You took a shit on my lawn then called me out to your den of hypocrisy. Go fuck yourselves. You lost the argument over big block and that’s why you’re stuck with a forked coin people call a scam. If bitcoin users truly wanted big blocks they’d be running ABC and holding BCH. They aren’t.

The users who were around before this whole mess already do run ABC and/or hold BCH.

"Some of these are a real stretch. People saying they think Bitcoin will get shut down or crash in value and then the ""change of oppinion"" amounts to ""the blockchain has huge potential"".

"&gt;My point is that BCH value prop is not working to drive TXs to the chain. Not that TXs themselves aren't working.

Transaction on BCH chain are steadily increasing since the release of Memo and Blockpress. 

&gt;Is it though?

Yes, due to reasons stated. Questioning again and refuting an argument are different things.. 

&gt;Fantastic. Now how come the market isn't coming flocking over to BCH then?

From what I can tell, over the past couple weeks the market did flock to BCH. At least more than they did to BTC. 

&gt;Except current growth isn't there. In fact, the value of transactions has been going down steadily since launch.

But it is, we are growing. More tx per block than before is growth. 

&gt;but I'm not a developer.

&gt;Yeah that's readily apparent.

You don't have to be an asshole. I'm just being honest, i'm not a developer - but that doesn't mean that I can't understand some of these things. This space is going to need much more than developers to thrive. 

&gt;I'm just pointing out that it's merely hype. That's all. Not taking a stab beyond that.

You're right, you can post anything you want here :) But whether it's ""just hype"" as you say is something that can't be quantified at the moment. Its simply your opinion and I disagree with it for reasons stated. 

&gt;Lol, what? BCH is way down from it's ATH.

Literally everything is down from its ATH. But every other time BCH, BTC or any of the other top 5 coins have dropped below an ATH before they crush it later on. That was my point. 

&gt;Please explain why the (all knowing, all loving) market is so slow to realize this? Please explain why volume is still in the shitter and TXs values are falling while blocks aren't even filling up? None of what you're saying makes sense when comparing against the relevant metrics. It's just wishful thinking.

Because the community in general is still hyped on a failing coin. BTC isn't what it once was. Its been crippled in order to put money in the hands of different people. And/or to run it into the ground. I'm not sure exactly yet. But my eyes and ears will remain open. 

Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-sMbf2OzOY&amp;feature=youtu.be) and look into these articles - [massive disinformation](https://medium.com/@jonaldfyookball/why-some-people-call-bitcoin-cash-bcash-this-will-be-shocking-to-new-readers-956558da12fb) and [censorship campaign](https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43) that's been waged on r/bitcoin for [over two years](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/informative_btc_vs_bch_articles/dl8v4lp/) now. And if you already have and you still think the way you do then we're at a standstill and no more can be done for our conversation. 

&gt;Lol, then why does the market disagree? All metrics point towards far greater confidence in BTC than BCH. Furthermore, LN is a solution that will actually help scale BTC to 8 billion people. It's not just some band-aid fix. Scale, privacy, speed and fees are all orders and orders of magnitude better with LN than with shitty on-chain bloat.

When the LN is actually reliable and is actually used on the scale of the rest of the crypto world I may agree with you, but until then it's ""just hype"". Sound familiar? haha 

I think discussion is a good thing and I appreciate your point of view but I do see things differently. I'm sorry if I offended you along the way, as it was not my intention. ",1525727772
"Currently, you can't remove crypto from Robinhood once you purchase it",1525727759
"If i want to spend more than 2000€ on a purchase I have to call my bank and ask them to raise the limit. I'm literally asking for permission to spend my money.

With bitcoin I can spend any number of them without asking anyone.

I bet there's way better examples, but this is just something I've actually experienced.",1525727723
"Yea i have one, but RH is the only option I have to trade cryptos with my phone. Maybe i’ll just not put too much into btc/eth on their platform since i’m worried.",1525727711
Maybe he prefers Bitcoin cash XD,1525727707
The best way to look at robinhood is think of it like a closed stock account with no fees. You're buying stock in BTC or ETH but the only thing you can do is either HODL or cash out. Yeah you can't move it around but if that's not important as much as a pure investing vehicle then you're all set. As for their trustworthiness... well I guess it's a tiny gamble. But they seem to be on the ball.,1525727689
"Oh great! I'm really glad you're not a ""them vs. us"" fanatic yourself because constructive conversation is just what I've got, and I have good news about the BTC tx fees which you thought were equivalent to those of mobile money platforms there. 

You see, between advancements like batching tx and SegWit the BTC mempool is much less congested these days. You can get confirmations in the next couple blocks by paying only 21 sat/byte. That's about $0.63 cents USD for a standard transaction, which is far below the cost of mobile money systems which you mentioned. Still too high? Well I've got even better news! Lightning Network apps are rolling out at a brisk pace and 2nd layer adoption is growing daily. You can use that as well and pay just 1 satoshi for the whole transaction! Best of all, you'd be getting BTC which is accepted by far more people and locations than any other cryptocurrency, that gives you the best chance of being able *actually use* BTC to pay your suppliers with that than with any other cryptocurrency unless you're resigned to liquidating it for your local fiat and pay those pesky exchange rates.

"&gt; I did cite it, you're insufferable.
&gt; 
&gt; Furthermore, a quick glance a Twitter reveals all sorts of mindless, repetitive comments that are surely astroturfing. Who besides Roger has the resources to throw at that?

This is a list of attacks on Roger's character. I am not going to do your research for you. Please point precisely to the portions of relevance. Which of those many links show evidence he hired an astroturfing company, and what is the name of said company?

&gt; Evidence is partially circumstantial, as I've already described. 

Would inconclusive be a good descriptor too?

&gt; No shit Roger denies any wrong doing. Guy also says it's not wrong to promote BCH as Bitcoin. He's devoid of any reasonable ethical standard.

He believes BCH is Bitcoin. He backs up that claim with actual evidence. Bitcoin is not owned by any corporation or entity, so I see nothing unethical about having opinions about which project is Bitcoin. 

&gt; I mean that you should speak out against this behavior and distance yourself from scammers like Ver.

I haven't seen any behaviour to speak out against. Who did he scam exactly and what is his scam? Tell me how it works?

&gt; Also what is ""Bitcoin Core""? Bitcoin Core is a software client. So, yes, if you want to commit code to the core repository then the commits need to be accepted. 

So those with the keys to the repository are the ones that get to choose what changes can and cannot be made to Bitcoin? 

&gt; Anyone can make pull requests. 

Well obviously. ABC and unlimited made a pull request and now here we are.

&gt; I'm confused as to what this has to do with anything though. Did you mean to say ""Bitcoin""? If so, then no, you don't need permission, you just have to follow consensus rules, just like every other node. 

You were mentioning that I should work to kick Roger out of Bitcoin Cash. If I were able to kick someone out of a project then that would mean the project requires permission from me or others. I disagree. Core seems agree with this idea as they have mentioned consensus is impossible without their consent. That is really scary stuff. We are getting off topic though.

&gt;     This word again. Scamming. Sounds very sinister. I am not aware of him selling Bitcoin Cash to people at Bitcoin Core prices. That would be a scam. Telling people that he believes that Bitcoin Cash is the Bitcoin that Satoshi created is not a scam but an opinion.

&gt; Words have meanings. Use them correctly please. Bitcoin refers to the chain/network, not just the software. He's scamming people. Tricking people into thinking they're buying Bitcoin but actually BCH. That's a scam. Plain and simple.

It is alot more complicated then that. Bitcoin is defined by a whitepaper. It refers to itself as a 'Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System'. Roger claims that this title no longer defines Bitcoin Core. He also claims that the body of the document no longer defines Bitcoin Core. He has some good points. He is not trying to convince people that Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin Core. He is trying to convince them that Bitcoin Cash is more in line with the white paper then Bitcoin Core and thus should be called Bitcoin. That is not a scam, but an opinion. You disagree and that is fine, but that does not make it a scam. If I said Bush was a better president then Obama, would you call me a scammer?

&gt; Why do you care so much to defend his behavior?

What behavior am I defending? His stance on Bitcoin Cash. I agree with him, so I am defending my behaviour as much as his. The rest is allegations that are unproven. 

&gt; Sure. I would lose personal respect for them and their character would be called into question. Although ""association with the devil,"" - I couldn't give a shit about that religious nonsense other than it would be a bit weird, but the pedo allegation would be serious. 

You currently have respect for their character? Wow. Ok.

&gt; Except you don't. Also, like I said, there are numerous reasons to find Roger repulsive.

I have zero evidence for these claims which is what you have given me. Still waiting

&gt; Keep up with this game though. Keep pretending like I said people shouldn't use BCH because of Roger. How about some evidence on that one? Stop lying and changing the meaning of words. Words have meaning, use them correctly, please.

I hit a nerve here didn't I? Too funny. You are ok making up allegations about others, but don't like it when people do it to you. ",1525727448

Goldman announced the crypto trading desk in december,1525726735
"
&gt;Its a baby market because the amount of money that has gone in is very small, the price reacts strongly to demand because thr supply is inelastic. Its maybe the only asset with this property. It is also possible a giffen and veblen good.

Nope. Bitcoin has a higher market cap than many world currencies. In comparison it's highly unstable. 5 years ago the same excuse was used. Why so unstable? because it's not a currency, it's a speculative asset traded on a market with little or no rules. 65% value loss in several months? no problem. That would obliterate any functioning economy. I've been into crypto for 5 years, why aren't I spending my Bitcoin? oh yes, zero incentive, it's the equivalent of liquidising unstable stock when I can just use cash instead. Cash that is insured, covered, can pay in seconds. You use cash every day. 

Those are the facts. You use cash every day. You avoid spending your crypto no matter what. It's just a speculative asset to make you more cash. 


&gt;Fiat currencies maybe did allow for faster growth but at the expense of the future. The debt that we have accumulated is insane. Its not fair to put such a huge burden on the next generations.

The US is AAA, meaning it's lenders are AAA certain it will be able to service it's loans. A country like Norway could repay all of it's debt 4 times over - it chooses not to bc certain national debt is essential for the running and general functioning of the country. It's used in banks as collateral. It's actually essential. Stuff like this is the reason why you can afford a laptop, why you can go out and get a job.

But hey, who needs economics when we have Dogecoin

&gt;Can you tell me the average life of a fiat currency?

They don't have an end. Fiat currency in a modern form has been around since 1745

&gt;We learned a lot? Haha did banks stop selling shit bonds? Have they stopped giving out loans to everyone? Interest rates still cant increase.....

I will just repeat - the US pulled out of a systemic once in a lifetime crisis (on a par with 1929) in 2 and a half years. Regulations have tightened up significantly, leverage has decreased, stress tests have been improved, capital requirements have increased, credit rating agencies have tightened up. The economy speaks for itself.


&gt;The stock market is in a huge bubble, tax cuts were used for buybacks instead of investments, CEO pay increased even more, the average american doesnt have $1000 saved, everyone is in debt(student, medical, car, mortage)

Lol. Buzz phrases with no context googled from sites like Zerohedge. Remember the severe crash in the stock market earlier this year, one day drop of 4.6% worst since the FC. I've seen BTC do double that in just over an hour. 

Why? because it's a privately minted speculative asset traded on a Wild West market 

&gt;Housing is unaffordable, rent is only increasing, wages are still stagnant since 1970s, the gig economy was a scam, hethcare costs keep rising, they want to repeal the Dodd Frank, calls for extreme deregulation are being pushed..... Etc etc

Cool, what's unemployment at? 4.1% Outlook positive. Eurozone growing. 

It's annoying when the facts don't fit the doomsday narrative 

&gt;We never recovered

False. The country is actually in far better shape than it was pre 2007

You are regurgitating all this lazy financial alarmist stuff that's been around for 11 years with zero critical thinking or (I suspect) little understanding

It's been one of the best steady gainers in the last month. For good reason -- former Goldman and Coinbase employees on the team.

"As lechango mentioned, Fiat is rigged because it has increasing ""barriers to entry"". This is manifested in fees, in requirements for new accounts, in high-interest debt accounts, as well as high-fee payment cards, the cost to participate slowly rises, even for simple things like doing laundry. These are restrictions to economic participation. It guarantees a class of poor people while wealthier people benefit from them, but it also slowly pushes middle-class people down into poverty. Because of these restrictions to the flow of money, most jobs (unless the company is rapidly growing) begin to pay less and less because you have to pay people less to keep your business going when nobody can afford to buy your products. So wealth is then restricted and so starts to flow slower and healthy competition gets reduced. The economy is suffocating and with it the people involved.

Bitcoin Cash solves this problem because there is very low barrier to entry. There are no high-interest debt fees, there are no high-fee payments cards, and the cost to participate in the economy (if you obtain payment for work via Bitcoin Cash) there is no exorbitant costs for participation. You are free to participate and will benefit from doing so.

"&gt; Oh weird, can you show me the BCH transactions that aren't working?

My point is that BCH value prop is not working to drive TXs to the chain. Not that TXs themselves aren't working.

&gt;I think the idea that this is ""just hype"" is short sighted. With applications like Memo and Blockpress, as I mentioned earlier, this is much more than hype.

Is it though?

&gt; Its being prepared for the future. If someone were to come out with a new application of the BCH blockchain that required bigger blocks, we're now ready for it. We are no longer simply a ledger for currency.

Fantastic. Now how come the market isn't coming flocking over to BCH then?

&gt;The change to the code, increasing the cap, didn't change anything in practice at this point. Those of us paying attention know this and are excited anyway, because it allows for future growth.

Except *current* growth isn't there. In fact, the value of transactions has been going down steadily since launch.

&gt;but I'm not a developer.

Yeah that's readily apparent.

&gt;Coming to a post about development of a chain you don't support is just idiocy.

Why? I thought this place was for open **Bitcoin** discussion. 

&gt;Why stab at positive movement?

I'm just pointing out that it's merely hype. That's all. Not taking a stab beyond that.

&gt;I could see a drop in price after the upgrade as well, but it, like every other drop in price so far, will only be a temporary one.

Lol, what? BCH is way down from it's ATH. It glaringly dishonest to claim that these dips are short lived when we're currently in the midst of one and the coin is barely able to reach 1/5th the value of Bitcoin for any reasonable period of time. Cart before the horse much?

&gt;Once people like you and the other user catch on that this is bigger than you realize now, the price will continue to increase. But that isn't the point.

Uh what? Please explain why the (all knowing, all loving) market is so slow to realize this? Please explain why volume is still in the shitter and TXs values are falling while blocks aren't even filling up? None of what you're saying makes sense when comparing against the relevant metrics. It's just wishful thinking. 

&gt;The point is to create something that will change the world. 

I agree. 

&gt;I don't know that BCH will for sure be that thing, but so far its doing a hell of a lot better than its counterpart.

Lol, then why does the market disagree? All metrics point towards far greater confidence in BTC than BCH. Furthermore, LN is a solution that will *actually* help scale BTC to 8 billion people. It's not just some band-aid fix.

It would make them all billionaires or more out of nothing. Crypto is a business in it's nature, not a ""decentrilized"" currency like many of us peasants hype it. It has decentrilized properties but in general it's not. 
Also don't forget that most of the people are in crypto to make a profit. If people can't make a profit but make losses instead, crypto is forgotten quickly. No one really cares in general about crypto's ability as a currency because fiat is doing just fine with very few exceptions compared to crypto. Those very few exceptions is where crypto is great at and it should be further developed.

"&gt;If there is ample evidence then you should have no problem providing it. You are making the claim and after 8 messages you have yet to source it.

I did [cite it](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8hhgo7/ujratcliff63367s_admission_that_he_guessed_when/dyllvyo/), you're insufferable.

Furthermore, a quick glance a Twitter reveals all sorts of mindless, repetitive comments that are surely astroturfing. Who besides Roger has the resources to throw at that?

&gt;rebuke (someone), especially officially.

Slap on the wrist, if even that.

&gt;Nice. I didn't expect you to acknowledge that.

Why?

&gt;Still waiting on this ample evidence. Also waiting on evidence that the one doing the astroturfing is a company hired by Roger.

Evidence is partially circumstantial, as I've already described. No shit Roger denies any wrong doing. Guy also says it's not wrong to promote BCH as Bitcoin. He's devoid of any reasonable ethical standard.

&gt;Allows is plural. Allowed would imply he was aware it was happening. So this is unfounded.

He hired the guy, caught the guy and continued to employ the guy. Allows. 

&gt;Roger, as far as you or I am know, was not aware of the guys actions until after he was caught. So no he never admitted as such. Words have meaning, use them correctly please.

Kept the guy on. Allows.

&gt;This word again. Scamming. Sounds very sinister. I am not aware of him selling Bitcoin Cash to people at Bitcoin Core prices. That would be a scam. Telling people that he believes that Bitcoin Cash is the Bitcoin that Satoshi created is not a scam but an opinion.

Words have meanings. Use them correctly please. Bitcoin refers to the chain/network, not just the software. He's scamming people. Tricking people into thinking they're buying Bitcoin but actually BCH. That's a scam. Plain and simple.

&gt;Why would I want to push anyone out of a project. I want the entire world to use Bitcoin Cash, not just the people I like. Do you think that Bitcoin Cash, or Bitcoin Core should be a permissioned project? Do you think you should have to ask someone permission to participate?

I mean that you should speak out against this behavior and distance yourself from scammers like Ver.

Also what is ""Bitcoin Core""? Bitcoin Core is a software client. So, yes, if you want to commit code to the core repository then the commits need to be accepted. Anyone can make pull requests. I'm confused as to what this has to do with anything though. Did you mean to say ""Bitcoin""? If so, then no, you don't need permission, you just have to follow consensus rules, just like every other node. 

&gt;This talk about how horrible he is is very old. I remember it was first started by the Buttcoiners. They told me I shouldn't use Bitcoin because Roger is a felon. Now you are telling me not to use Bitcoin Cash for the same reason. I see no reason to listen to either of you.

When did I say that? I never said that. Stop making up bullshit. Use BCH all you want, I couldn't care less. Roger *is* a scammer and a convict. Stop putting words in my mouth. I couldn't care less if people want to use BCH.

&gt;You seem pretty passionate about this. Why do you care so much about his character? 

I'm merely answering and responding to questions. Roger *is* a scumbag and this can be demonstrated on multiple fronts. Why do you care so much to defend his behavior?

&gt;If I provided evidence of Luke's association with the devil and Greg's paedophilia, would that matter as much to you? 

Sure. I would lose personal respect for them and their character would be called into question. Although ""association with the devil,"" - I couldn't give a shit about that religious nonsense other than it would be a bit weird, but the pedo allegation would be serious. 

I have as much evidence for both of those claims as you have provided for the claims of Roger's astroturfing by the way.

Except you don't. Also, like I said, there are numerous reasons to find Roger repulsive.

Keep up with this game though. Keep pretending like I said people shouldn't use BCH because of Roger. How about some evidence on that one? Stop lying and changing the meaning of words. **Words have meaning, use them correctly, please.**",1525725495

"Why does he have to keep killing Bitcoin Cash's image.

A completely legitimate project started by those angry at Blockstream and the censorship. The community wanted bigger block limits, Blockstream wanted 2nd layer solutions.

What a surprise the company with all the money and power and influence managed to control the outcome. Its so sad. 

I encourage people to just research how BCH came into existence. It's a powerful story, and most people don't know it. ",1525724165
"&gt; I said there's ample evidence. I'm not lying about anything. The evidence is readily available. Draw your own conclusions (or don't).

If there is ample evidence then you should have no problem providing it. You are making the claim and after 8 messages you have yet to source it.

&gt; Got reprimanded? Lol. The guy not only got caught but tried to hide the fact that he got caught. Also, reprimanded? Lol, what does that even mean. 

rebuke (someone), especially officially.

&gt; Granted one sockpuppet is not a wide ranging astroturfing operation, 

Nice. I didn't expect you to acknowledge that.

&gt; but like I already said the evidence of additional astroturfing is readily apparent and available. 

Still waiting on this ample evidence. Also waiting on evidence that the one doing the astroturfing is a company hired by Roger.

&gt; Either way, Roger allows this behavior at his company 

Allows is plural. Allowed would imply he was aware it was happening. So this is unfounded.

&gt; and he has already admitted as much. Any reputable org would have this guy out in the same day. 

Roger, as far as you or I am know, was not aware of the guys actions until after he was caught. So no he never admitted as such. Words have meaning, use them correctly please.

&gt; Except that Roger is the main figurehead for the project and he is scamming people into thinking BCash is Bitcoin, bottom line.

This word again. Scamming. Sounds very sinister. I am not aware of him selling Bitcoin Cash to people at Bitcoin Core prices. That would be a scam. Telling people that he believes that Bitcoin Cash is the Bitcoin that Satoshi created is not a scam but an opinion.

&gt;  If you cared about the project then you'd work to push him out of it. 

Why would I want to push anyone out of a project. I want the entire world to use Bitcoin Cash, not just the people I like. Do you think that Bitcoin Cash, or Bitcoin Core should be a permissioned project? Do you think you should have to ask someone permission to participate?

&gt; This seemed to be happening many months ago (much talk in this sub about what a scumbag he was and wishes that he would leave the space). Now that effort has seemingly died off (I wonder why...). 

This talk about how horrible he is is very old. I remember it was first started by the Buttcoiners. They told me I shouldn't use Bitcoin because Roger is a felon. Now you are telling me not to use Bitcoin Cash for the same reason. I see no reason to listen to either of you.

&gt; I never said it did. I didn't create this post, OP did. Look at the fucking title, it's centered around these allegations. And you're claiming that I'm off topic? Get real.

You seem pretty passionate about this. Why do you care so much about his character? If I provided evidence of Luke's association with the devil and Greg's paedophilia, would that matter as much to you. I have as much evidence for both of those claims as you have provided for the claims of Roger's astroturfing by the way.",1525724148

Example for Bitcoin transactions vs banks transactions. No technicalities.

"REQ has been one of the poorest performers during this so-called recovery.

It has the worst price action of all of the alts, selling off HARD on slight fluctuations in the price of BTC, and then having the weakest recoveries, usually delayed for weeks.

This has been one of the hardest holds I've endured, a total dog, and to think I could have had a six-digit stack of ZRX instead right now...",1525724078
"A lot of people make the mistake of believing something is decentralized just because it looks decentralized from a technical point of view. But decentralization is not just about technology, in fact it's only just a small part of it. A lot of times something that's theoretically decentralized gives rise to heavily centralized systems because of economic factors.

That's why we have Facebooks and Googles and Twitters, even though the underlying protocol that powers the internet is decentralized. 

And this is why many people are mistaken about Lightning network for example. Many newbies who think they're smart think lightning network can't possibly be centralized because they've read the whitepaper and the technology sounds pretty ""decentralized"". But everlyone who believes lightning will centralize don't believe they will centralize because their protocol itself is centralized. They believe so because the macro design of the protocol will eventually push each economic actors into becoming centralized.

I don't know if you actually fully understand how memo.cash and blockpress protocols work behind the scenes, but they all require a centralized database to function well. Sure, anyone can take the protocol and build their own implementation on top of it, but that will still require a centralized server. And because of economic incentives, it will make more sense to centralize (and the users will want them to become centralized).

Again, I'm not saying this is bad. This is natural compromise since there is no other easy alternative, and it's still much more centralized than currently existing social networks. But this doesn't change the fact that these services will centralize. It would be crazy for the operators of these sites to intentionally push towards decentralization since even their users will want centralized features. If you look at all the feature suggestions made by the users on memo.cash and blockpress, most of them are centralizing features.

The issue I took with memo.cash was that their protocol implementation didn't even work properly in the beginning, which meant anyone who wanted to build a client for memo.cash couldn't just build one and let people post, and make it show up on memo.cash website. I totally understand the technical difficulties during the early days so I do not blame this. 

But I DO think it's bullshit to say that their competition should have just implemented their protocol when:

1. Blockpress launched before memo.cash (even though they didn't get enough traction)
2. Memo.cash protocol didn't even work properly on their own memo.cash site. Why should another party build on that protocol when nothing is certain and memo.cash could even change their own ""protocol"" at any time?
3. Memo.cash protocol was not perfect. I've explained elsewhere on this thread but, the multiple push data for OP_RETURNs is not considered standard.

You didn't go through the actual trouble to implement the protocol, so you can easily just say blockpress is a shameless copycat, and call me an idiot for not understanding what ""decentralization"" means in the context of protocols. But I do know very well what it means. And I'm sure blockpress had the same dilemma when they made the decision to go on their own. Please don't censor innovation by trying to make everything look the same. That's fascism and that's why we're not on /r/bitcoin but on /r/btc. Socially pressuring developers to build on a single ""social networking protocol"" is like saying ""Facebook should be the only social network"".",1525724076

"It depends on what crashes, the reason, and a lot of other things. One big problem right now is there is a large amount of debt. Debt is basically extra liquidity now for less growth/more pain later. If the debt were to be called by everywhere at once - probably everything would be subject to a fall in respective dollars (or other fiat currency, because debt collection would be deflationary in nature.)  
  
Now if there are particular areas that pop and not everything, bitcoin could be an 'uncorrelated asset' that has a lot of money trying to escape asset bubbles. Commodities/Staples would probably see a similar rise as it is usually a 'safe-haven' during those turmoil events.  
  
However, if the crash is caused by something relatively catastrophic (metor/solar flare/pole shift/yellowstone event) I doubt digital currencies would be as valued as something like medicine/food/toliet paper would be in such a scenario.

"Many people who were BTC big blockers are now BCH supporters. The central planners of BTC have blocked an increase in block size for BTC. For that reason BCH was created. You are rational in thinking that BTC should have a short term plan for scaling while waiting for the long term plan to be complete. Unfortunately the BTC planners disagree with you. You aren't even allowed to discuss it on r\bitcoin - and that was the reason (censorship) that r/btc was created in the first place. So you should understand that Bitcoin has big blocks in the BCH fork, and not in the BTC fork. If you like Big Blocks and you can not lie - use BCH. :)",1525723653
"For anyone curious what all 7 are

"&gt; Let's take that 2010 bug

Back in 2010 there was plenty of (needed) development taking place, so the likelihood of bugs being introduced was high. Now in 2018, *needed* development has slowed down completely. The only thing that is changing these days are things that don't need to change at all, like cashaddr and those new opcodes. Unfortunately the reality of the situation is that many people believe that changing the code in the name of ""innovation"" will help the price, so pointless changes like cashaddr and the new opcodes are hyped up by investors which encourages ""devs"" to continue making pointless changes after pointless change. These changes may introduce more bugs for no benefit other than give people hope that the new ""innovation"" will pump the price.

Bugs in software is not like mold on a bread that just appears instantaneously. Someone has to change something in working code in order for a bug to appear. If no changes to the code are made, no bugs will exist. There are altcoins that haven't had a single code change since 2013 that still operate perfectly as a store of value and a payment network today as they did in 2013.

&gt; It's not possible to write programs where errors are impossible

Its possible to make a change to working software in such a way that the change is impossible to screw up. For instance the blocksize limit. It's absolutely impossible to mess up changing a 1 to a 2, no matter how mentally retarded you are. On the other hand, it *is* very possible to mess up implementing bech32/cashaddr because those changes are very complex. If all you're doing is changing a number, then it's bug proof. If you're adding complex code then even the smartest developers may make a mistake. In my opinion, the only changes to Bitcoin that should ever be made are changes to the numbers.

&gt; And in the case of protecting a decentralized protocol, having multiple different implementations is one of the best ways to protect it.

Multiple implementations probably helps the lightning network more than BCH because the LN is still under heavy development. BCH shouldn't be under heavy development, as the core idea that BCH operates under (the white paper) hasn't changed in many years.",1525723477

"Absolutely. 
Institutions, exchanges, and some no doubt owned by holders who can't access them for whatever reason (lost wallets, deceased, incarcerated), some of which will never be touched. 
However, there are quite a few large balances in wallets held by long time hodlers. I think it would be naive to think someone with a balance of 50,000 coins won't realise their profit at some stage. How many of these people are there? Sure, if these people are well intentioned and are aware of the damage they could cause then it doesn't need to be a problem. Coins can be dripped into the market, or sold OTC. 
But there is still a massive imbalance in the distribution and I can see it being a problem sooner or later. I actually think this issue could be the eventual downfall of Bitcoin and a more fairly distributed coin could replace it as the standard. ",1525723378

The fact that there will never be more than 20mil bitcoins is a FEATURE, inherit BY DESIGN.  Imagine what the price of gold would look like if tomorrow we were able to say ""this is exactly how much gold there is left, and thats it, no more will ever be mined after that because it'll all be out of the earth"".  Just look at the price of helium over the last decade and even that can be [expensively] made.

"&gt; Yet you can't provide them. Also someone else using it does not prove Roger is using it. So you believe that he is hiring an astroturfing company but claim you know he is hiring an astroturfing company. That is called lying. Why are you lying?

I said there's ample evidence. I'm not lying about anything. The evidence is readily available. Draw your own conclusions (or don't).

&gt;No there isn't. Astroturfing is doing this on a very large scale. A single sockpuppet does not equal astroturfing. Also there is no evidence this is still going on. Someone got caught, he got repremanded.

Got reprimanded? Lol. The guy not only got caught but tried to hide the fact that he got caught. Also, reprimanded? Lol, what does that even mean. 

Granted one sockpuppet is not a wide ranging astroturfing operation, but like I already said the evidence of additional astroturfing is readily apparent and available.

"Trading is much riskier than passive income, and also much more time consuming. Personally my endgoal is also to have the majority of my crypto locked up in passive income constructions like nodes or staking. I do forsee the volatility in this market eventually mellowing out somewhat and at that point you're probably happy with your passive, guaranteed income.  
Another thing is the benefits that ownership of some nodes bring with them beyond passive income, such as whitelist access to ICOs, airdrops etc.",1525722078
"&gt; Correct. But the usefulness of that is very limited. Scaling effect of LN will come form its ability to route payment efficently (the problem is to do trustlessly and remain scalable)
&gt; There is nothing in the BOLT spec that defines ""efficiently"" as a requirement for routing. 2 hops or 20 hops the end user won't notice. Just as they don't notice how many hops to their favorite websites.

Certainly, the problem is not the number of hops your payment require, the problem is the amount of ressource it takes the network as whole to route a payment.

Currently channel need to know the whole network topology to find a route. 

it is inefficient each time a time is made all other channel have to broadcast their “status” (linear scaling)

&gt; For payment channel without routing I agree. How many time you exchange money with the same person back and forth?
&gt; Routing doesn't matter either, 

Can you give me **one** real life example when you need to exchange money with someone back and forth, regularly?

&gt;do you count how many hops you have before you load a website? No. You either have a route to the website or you don't.

Knowing if you have a route or not is the problem.

The only 100% trusless way to do that is to ask all channel of the network to collect the whole network topology... for each payment as it is implemented now.

And obviously that doesn't scale.


&gt; This is not true, I believe large block is the way to gain decentralisation. Look at ETH for example, their blockchain is enormous, yet there is way more ETH nodes than BTC one.
&gt; ouch really bad example. ETH has major scaling problems. Even they know linear is not any option. They're blockchain sync time is already 1 week for beefy nodes. It won't be long before full sync is given up on entirely and you will sync from point in time in the block chain trusting the node serving you for everything that happened before that. But seriously, ETH is a perfect example of why linear scaling of blocks only can't work.

Yet they have more nodes. interesting isn’t it?

Not a little, a lot more.. 15.000 nodes compare to 9.000

How do you explain that..?

If big block led to centralisation shouldn't ETH nodes count be very low.. much lower than BTC?

&gt; And how those implementations scale?
&gt; I'm not sure what you mean? Are you implying finding a route isn't possible at scale? Why whats different about the network topology at scale ?

I am asking how those routing algo scale with tx demand, unless they are magicaly finding route without interacting with the network those routing algo will have to take ressource from other channel/node/hub to route payments.

How much ressource path finding take on the network as a whole is critical to know how LN scale.

So far very bad, other implementation might improve on it, I am curious to know.

&gt; Those two problems have nothing in common.
&gt; They have in common what you said, its not a problem now so why even bother talking about it.

Well then why BCH block are mostly empty, if the tragedy of the common you are afraid about is true? (and why it has happen with BTC also?)

"I see your points, especially with betting. I trade in financial markets regularly, and the hedging vehicles I use in most cases either aren't available in crypto, or are difficult to come by.

But, I don't agree with you that you only hedge if there are possibilities to make money on both sides. Sure, that's a good time to hedge, straddles are a good example with options. But, I hedge for other reasons. As an example, without getting political, if I'm worried about a head political figure in the US tweeting something that could cause a drop in the markets as a whole, but I want to capture the upside on a specific company I view as severely underpriced, I might buy calls ATM or slightly OTM on the company (capturing unsystematic risk), and then buy puts on say the Nasdaq for a tech company to protect the downside if the entire market drops(hedging systematic).

With crypto, it's a bit more difficult, so I get your point. You can't readily buy downside protection, unless you short, which is essentially taking the opposite of your position. Also, shorts aren't available to everyone. If by ""hedging"", one is referring to taking the opposite side of their ""bet"", then your argument has validity. When I hear hedge, I think of taking away parts of the risk, while keeping the risk you'd like. 

There are Alts that have somewhat of a negative correlation with the major coins, and in the right markets, I might use those as a hedge. Also there is some argument to be made to hedging equity with crypto, but since equity markets have been trending up basically since crypto came around, I don't really know if there is validity to that or not. You can even employ short-term hedges though with crypto. I know when the market is trending up, I constantly did that. For example, I consider BTC to basically drive the market, but during bull markets, there are times where not everything follows BTC down right away, and you can use short-term hedges there by, say, shorting BTC at a multiple, and holding your ETH position while it is hot.

Anyways, I guess I'm not necessarily arguing with you if you are speaking of hedging as taking the opposing side as in betting terms, I just view it a bit differently, more of hedging out market risk, etc. ",1525721831

That's not a contradiction at all... He doesn't think the currency should be out of the blue, he does think existing currency can just be moved to a chain... and he's right.

Mark Cuban: ""Nope I havn't invested in Bitcoin yet, I go up and down on it"" After: Yes, i bought some. 

Ok, so someone asked and he said he was considering it and undecided...then he apparently later on did buy some. This doesn't seem like a reversal of criticism or something. 

Thomas Peterffy: Again, how are these statements even a little contradictory? I'm worried its volatile and I think listing it on major markets is good..

Yet the post was deleted for supporting a contentious hard fork and I was called a /btc shill.

I hold more BTC than BCH and want it to do well. I am one of the many people who got to the game late after the fork had happened. 

I posted the same thread on /btc. I have to say the responses there haven't been too rational either. Is there no space for people like me anymore? It makes me sad to see the Bitcoin community so split and hostile towards each other.

Petro is even illegal in Venezuela. The government hasn't made any other currency as legal tender but only the hyperinflationary Bolívar Fuerte. Cryptocurrencies are illegal, mining cryptocurrencies is also illegal. Importing PC parts, rigs, graphic cards, motherboards or even phones is prohibited because these can be used for mining cryptocurrencies. People get jailed for mining bitcoin.

It never had more than 2000 players logged in at the same time.

To this day even with the gaming population dwindling to \&lt; 500 active players, you can sell a unique/legendary/overpowered item for a stupid amount of US dollars. The same could be said for the currency you've amassed. Both of which, and this illustrates my point, you'd have much more of due to the fact you were around for the game's early days on AOL/Prodigy.

Yes, it's quite annoying. There's no excuse for why I have low karma on this sub either. I'm not ""bashing"" BCash, I'm trying to have an open and honest conversation about the pertinent topics. I can assure you I didn't earn this bad karma.

&gt;It's besides the point i was making that just because one thing today is flying high that doesn't mean it will be tomorrow.

I didn't say that. My point is that ""first mover"" in this space is not comparable to other spaces. This is a consensus based network with built-in economic incentives.

&gt;of course it matters as i noted in the other thread on this page. 5 years? if BCH chooches along simply/quickly/cheaply while BTC spends 5 years figuring out LN to do the same, BTC will be irrelevant. should the tech be worth it BCH could also adopt it. you seem to have some kind of strange expectation that technical superiority would draw everyone in - not if the BCH train already left the station. history is full of technically superior products in various ways losing out to others for various reasons.

Lol, it's not about tech superiority drawing people in. It's about BCH has an untenable roadmap, BTC doesn't and there's no demand for what BCH is offerring **today**. You're deluded if you think people are itching to use BCH to pay for coffee and dinner and such frivolous things. 

&gt;i don't believe this is true at all. it's absolutely not simple and i don't believe the routing will be as trivial as you claim it to be once it gets more use and users. i find the comparison to the internet to be false because the internet relies on a pretty trusty routing system.

Lmao, you didn't say anything of substance here, so there's nothing I can respond to. This is pure FUD. 

&gt;you already brought up steam yourself. here's 3 more: https://www.engadget.com/2018/01/23/stripe-stop-accepting-bitcoin-april/ https://news.bitcoin.com/miami-bitcoin-conference-stops-accepting-bitcoin-due-to-fees-and-congestion/ https://news.bitcoin.com/microsoft-has-stopped-accepting-bitcoin-deposits/

I didn't bring up steam and either way Steam doesn't accept BCH either *and* you've listed 3 anecdotes. Are you for real? 
I want full data sets for both projects before I'll even engage on this point. **Don't forget, segwit alone is still processing more TXs than BCH and higher value TXs. Do not ignore this brutal fact regarding the supposed superiority of BCH in merchant adoption**. Of you don't have numbers that suggest otherwise, I'll have to assume that BTC is still much more popular for this purpose.

&gt;BCH is a currency and as such is also a store of value. the only thing that doesn't make sense is the claim of BTC being a store of value only or for that to primarily be its function. bitcoin would have gone nowhere were this the original white paper.


Nonsensical, circular argument. 

&gt;my understanding is ripple was designed to minimize fees/maximize speed between banks with these being used as a token in the market to enable price discovery of what that transfer fee would be. i don't think of XRP as currency which i noted prior.

It serves means of exchange use case far better than BCH. Bottom line. So do a number of other projects and legacy systems. BCH simply cannot compete on this level. It can't compete with LN either but that's a different story.

&gt;gold is rather centralized and has been a store of value and hard/sound money forever. USD are very centralized yet still have store of value properties. not as good as gold, better than pesos, nonetheless the point is still the same - it has the property. i don't understand how you are claiming BCH doesn't have it, outside of the fact that you simply don't like BCH.

It doesn't have the property (or the property is weaker) because of metcalfe's law, contentious break with PoW consensus and much worse liquidity, volume, etc. My point is that it's inferior to Bitcoin in this regard and money, being a network good, is strengthened by large networks. Competing and redundant projects cannot be expected to *also* have robust store of value properties. If BCash were the predominant, trust, greatest liquidity, ""gold standard"" crypto then your argument might make sense but it isn't and can't be expected to take over just because of a few supposed novel use cases.

&gt;i never claimed it was processing less, but that BCH will have cheaper fees on chain.

That's also not necessarily true or at least not true to a reasonable degree. Segwit is effectively a block size increase and Bitcoin's block limit will also be raised at the appropriate time. Beyond that, AGAIN, LN is free or cost fractions of pennies to transact. Willfully pretending like LN isn't part of this conversation is pretty stupid. LN will crush BCH in terms of speed and fees (and also, obviously security [and let's not forget privacy either]).

&gt;agreed, i see no reason to question the integrity of the BTC or BCH network. at one point are you claiming they would finally be sound?

I'm saying that the larger the network (both in terms of accumulated difficulty / hashing power **and** coin distribution / liquidity) the more ""sound"" the network and chain are. Again, this is governed by PoW consensus rules and metcalfe's law (as well as other network effects).

&gt;slowing adoption is always bad, instead of making larger blocks, BTC solutions have led to high fees and loss of adoption

This is simply not true on multiple fronts as I've already explained. I don't feel like rehashing the same point over and over.

&gt;and BTC as well right? nonetheless BTC has more of everything behind it. BCH is trying to fork and carry that legacy everything over plus offer a better medium of exchange than BTC is able to offer. maybe it will succeed maybe it will not. maybe more hash will move over, maybe it will not. the paper you refer to still refers to the 'store of value' offering the best medium of exchange it can right? the bitcoin based blockchain that does that more simply and cheaply today is BCH. if it gets greater adoption it can certainly take hash rate as well, and if LN takes 5 years how can you be so sure although it didn't capture the network aug 1 that it won't aug 1 5 years from now?

Lol, firstly I didn't say it will take 5 years. I said it will likely be much more fully implemented in 6 months to a year. Secondly, LTC's network and liquidity is inferior to that of Bitcoin. Differences between the two in terms of chain performance are rather negligible and not important. BTC has the network effect and momentum behind its conception of scaling. LTC was never even positioned to overtake BTC to begin with and certainly isn't now. HOWEVER, it's superior to BCH in terms of its on chain processing times, speed, fees, network, etc. Comparing LTC to BTC is apples and oranges because BTC is scaling primarily through chain improvments (segwit, schnorr, etc.) and abstracted layers. This makes on-chain performance a tangential consideration. 

&gt;i haven't seen the paper but thanks for the link. it articulates the store of value vs. payment rail far better than anything else i've seen poorly espouse this view.

Eh, did you read the whole thing? It doesn't actually bode very well for BCH or ETH or most other cryptos. 

The bottom line is that BCH has a terrible roadmap that will only become centralized with scale and **will never** compete with hierarchical payment networks. Ever. It's a terrible idea to scale on chain because then every node is processing every transaction. This is terrible design and it puts small time nodes and miners out of the game. Scaling off-chain is a much better design, preserves the integrity of the network (decentralization) **and is operational today**. 

I guarantee you that BCH's days are numbered. 

RemindMe! 1 year ""guy thinks that BCH is going to out-compete BTC+LN because there's such high demand for *merchant adoption* in regards to on chain transactions. Lol!""",1525719079

This is in reply to [your comment,](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8hpfgp/when_is_the_community_ready_for_a_block_size/dylj9rt/) posted here because r/bitcoin won't allow me to comment there.

&gt;it becomes a relevant topic once we start packing blocks after segwit and lightning are fully implemented.

SegWit will never be ""fully"" implemented unless it is made mandatory with a hardfork.

LN will never be ""fully"" implemented because it won't even be done for ""18 months^^TM ""

&gt;The Nov/December fee issue was largely manipulated and we can see it with all the logs showing low fee transactions getting spammed from the same IP's.

I really wanna know where you can see IP addresses from the originators of transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain.

Low fee transactions that you call ""spam"" are just people trying to get their transactions through and not caring how long it takes.

&gt;That was also before major exchanges had implemented segwit.

Blocks are still regularly full on peak weekday hours, including today:

https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#1,24h

&gt;&gt;Satoshi also described using side chains and second layers.

&gt;There is only one global chain.

&gt;The existing Visa credit card network processes about 15 million Internet purchases per day worldwide.  Bitcoin can already scale much larger than that with existing hardware for a fraction of the cost.  It never really hits a scale ceiling.

&gt;Eventually, most nodes may be run by specialists with multiple GPU cards.

&gt;A key aspect of Bitcoin is that the security of the network grows as the size of the network and the amount of value that needs to be protected grows.  The down side is that it's vulnerable at the beginning when it's small, although the value that could be stolen should always be smaller than the amount of effort required to steal it.  If someone has other motives to prove a point, they'll just be proving a point I already concede.

&gt;If you imagine it being used for some fraction of world commerce, then there's only going to be 21 million coins for the whole world [...] There's plenty of granularity if typical prices become small.  For example, if 0.001 is worth 1 Euro, then it might be easier to change where the decimal point is displayed, so if you had 1 Bitcoin it's now displayed as 1000, and 0.001 is displayed as 1.

I don't see any mention of sidechains, or a whole nother network of payment channels.",1525718489
"I mean, just about everything thats not IOTA or skycoin.  Saying Ethereum looks outdated, saying Bitcoin is too busy fighting Bcash that solving a solution, and a bunch more of these type of statements.  It sounds as though you based all of your information from subreddits.  

",1525718476
"So you spread the crypto word to everyone who is already into crypto?

I don’t get it. 

I’d say the need is to get crypto to those who have never experienced it. ",1525718468
"&gt; What I'm hearing is fee markets are ok which is distinctly different from what you have said previously in the thread. But anyways, since a fee market is not bad and cannot be avoided...Fee are ok obviously, Lots of small fees will make the network way more resilient than a network having to rely on a small set of tx fee to support its PoW.&gt;then the only difference then is if you want to preserve or do away with decentralization as a property of the network. You are clearly unconcerned with that remaining a property of the network. Therefore it is only natural for you to be drawn towards big blocks.

This is not true, I believe large block is the way to **gain** decentralisation.Look at ETH for example, their blockchain is enormous, yet there is way more ETH nodes than BTC one.&gt;Don't use the lazy smoke screen of fees and backlogs as justification. Just be honest and say you don't value decentralization as a property of the network and be done with it.I value decentralisation, I don’t think it can be achieve via small blocks.Think about it, what is the use of running a nodes for a network with super high fees? none, just a paperwallet is enough to hodl.
&gt; So sepcifically:
&gt; Yes, and that's apply to LN also.
&gt; It is an exponential improvement over blocks because there is instantaneous confirmation. There is no waiting at all. Instant confirmation time doesn’t mean it scale.&gt;If a set of parties have channels open amongst themselves and want to conduct tx between themselves the theoretical limits not bounded by PoW and blocks.

Correct. But the usefulness of that is very limited. Scaling effect of LN will come form its ability to route payment efficently (the problem is to do trustlessly and remain scalable)&gt;THey can exchange as fast as the nodes can update the contracts and broadcast the transactions. So you are looking at computation limitation x network bandwidth. Easily tens of thousands of tx/s before thresholds are reached. This is clearly an exponential improvement over blocks of any size.For payment channel without routing I agree.How many time you exchange money with the same person back and forth? 

Never.


&gt; At least scaling beyond 32MB is much better understood than LN/L2 scaling (routing/hub liquidity)
&gt; You are claiming scaling beyond 32 is much better understood. I said no it isn't. It doesn't exisst. (32 mb sure) but your claim that scaling beyond 32 is much better understood is unsubstantiated by anything. ""Its not even possible...it exists only in a lab and the imaginations of academics.""

Block larger than 32MB have been tested. LN routing and liquidity at large scale is completely unknown territory.

&gt; Routing is not even define yet?
&gt; Not understanding what you mean by that. If you routing over IP which it is(or can be), routing is defined. If you are talking about path finding? Well why must their be a single standard for path finding, who cares how someone determines a path, peoples priorities are different. for example if you want to plot speed vs. privacy on an x/y axis there can be different algo's depending on which quadrant you prefer. There is no ""right"" solution. BOLT protocol doesn't care thats why its not specified.

And how those implementations scale?
&gt; problem generated by hubs liquidity.
&gt; Is this like the
&gt; No indication of that for 80% of BTC history and no indication of for BCH.
&gt; Seems to apply, there is no indication of a problem right now....so thats good enough right?Those two problems have nothing in common.

&gt; You can't separate these principle from each other. A means of exchange system is efficiently worthless if it doesn't have store of value properties

BCH is a currency and as such is also a store of value.  the only thing that doesn't make sense is the claim of BTC being a store of value only or for that to primarily be its function.  bitcoin would have gone nowhere were this the original white paper.

&gt; (see XRP for prime example). 

my understanding is ripple was designed to minimize fees/maximize speed between banks with these being used as a token in the market to enable price discovery of what that transfer fee would be.  i don't think of XRP as currency which i noted prior.

&gt; BCH is the same, if it doesn't retain decentralization then it doesn't have store of value properties and it's effectively worth nothing (or will/should be).

gold is rather centralized and has been a store of value and hard/sound money forever.  USD are very centralized yet still have store of value properties.  not as good as gold, better than pesos, nonetheless the point is still the same - it has the property.  i don't understand how you are claiming BCH doesn't have it, outside of the fact that you simply don't like BCH.

&gt; Segwit on BTC, even in its current state, is still processing many more TXs and TXs of much greater value than BCH. Period. Your argument doesn't make sense because your premise just goes to show that BTC is still more useful, even on-chain.

i never claimed it was processing less, but that BCH will have cheaper fees on chain.

&gt; Wrong. Totally wrong on this one. Bitcoin's ""sound money"" properties are dependent on the integrity of the network, as outlined above.

agreed, i see no reason to question the integrity of the BTC or BCH network.  at one point are you claiming they would finally be sound?

&gt; And your point is? 

slowing adoption is always bad, instead of making larger blocks, BTC solutions have led to high fees and loss of adoption

&gt; Firstly, LTC is vastly superior to BCH. Secondly, my only point in making these comparisons is in regards to fees and speed. BCH will not compete with these technologies (and many legacy technologies) in terms of fees or speed. Chasing this means of exchange use case down the rabbit hole completely is a road to nowhere.

and BTC as well right?  nonetheless BTC has more of everything behind it.  BCH is trying to fork and carry that legacy everything over plus offer a better medium of exchange than BTC is able to offer.  maybe it will succeed maybe it will not.  maybe more hash will move over, maybe it will not.  the paper you refer to still refers to the 'store of value' offering the best medium of exchange it can right?  the bitcoin based blockchain that does that more simply and cheaply today is BCH.  if it gets greater adoption it can certainly take hash rate as well, and if LN takes 5 years how can you be so sure although it didn't capture the network aug 1 that it won't aug 1 5 years from now?

i haven't seen the paper but thanks for the link.  it articulates the store of value vs. payment rail far better than anything else i've seen poorly espouse this view.",1525717494
"Buffet and Munger have the balls to bash crypto, but to my knowledge, neither one every really bothered to apologize to the millions of average people that Well Fargo ripped off (with the fake accounts being foisted on consumers to boost revenue).  Wells execs being paid millions to retire after doing such a fine job, overseeing acts that should have been criminal, and yet that's not ""toxic garbage.""

Neither is Goldman, apparently, the great vampire squid of finance, apparently, despite the roll they played in the crash.  Buffet made a ton propping them up in 09-10.  Things are only toxic to Warren and Charlie if they might lose money, or are too speculative.  Morality plays zero roll in any of this. 

Ever tried processing a claim with GEICO?  They'll fight you tooth and nail, because that's what insurance is: they spread the risk and fight the claims, all in the interest of making a profit.  Hanging ordinary people out to dry on claims despite years of on-time insurance payments isn't toxic, no way!  Its just business.

What Warren doesn't understand is that the vast majority of people in the world will never earn enough money to invest meaningfully in the stocks, bonds, or anything else for that matter.  This is not 1942.  If you've only got $50 to invest every month (which is true for a ton of people in the US) you are far better off swinging for 12 home runs every year than you are trying to get somewhere slowly -- because real wages are not going up.

You'd better believe that some portion of your investment portfolio should be in cryptocurrency.  Why?  Because (a) most people on the planet are already broke and willing to take a chance, (b) once the DEX's are here and really working well, investment in crypto will be unstoppable, and (c) this isn't all a scam: the next global economy will be built on blockchain, only Warren and Charlie won't be here to see it.

I can imagine what he would say because he has written about it time and again. When you invest in something, the number 1 rule is to not lose your money.

Tangible assets. Buffett didnt buy apple stock because he thinks the new iphone will be good. He bought it because he believes the buildings, tech, patents, equipment, etc are worth what he is paying. If they went under tomorrow, he believes he can make his money back anyway.

Moving on to crypto. When looking at it, he might agree crypto or blockchain are the future. Neat! So which one or brand will be the winner?

The reason he's controversial is because he owns bitcoin.com and uses that and other outlets and resources to try to conflate and re-define the fork and Bitcoin itself.  He's taken to renaming Bitcoin to ""Bitcoin Core"" on his website and at one point calling Bitcoin Cash bitcoin.  

Imagine if you were a new user trying to understand the difference between Bitcoin Cash (the fork) and Bitcoin and suddenly bitcoin.com uses a different name than the rest of the ecosystem and pushes an agenda that the fork is an ""upgrade"" despite the fact that the main community and ecosystem is far larger with the original coin.

So the market went down in a 2 day timeframe so none of this matters anymore? 

My point is still the same... go outside and chill. Stop day trading. As long as you buy good projects, nothing you buy today is going to look bad in 2, 3, 4, 5 years, as long as you check back now and then so you can react to general long term market moves. 

I mean, don't go buying something ""new"" that is completely unproven and just check back in 5 years. But if you buy projects that have large teams, and attending events, building partnerships, actively coding, hitting roadmap milestones, and are professional in their communications, you'll be just fine.

We ARE more stable today than we were in Jan.

Hell, we're probably more stable today than we were just last night. This last selloff looks like it was induced from weak hands panic selling potential SEC ETH news (when the SEC chairman has previously stated ETH isn't a security. 

It's dumb, weak stupid money giving their money to well researched buyers. Sure some weak stupid short term people bought the dip also, but when the market dips like it did last night, it's the confident patient buyers that are buying, because they believe in this thing long term.

So yeah, we're down 10% from yesterday, but we're more stable than we were. We'll recover in a few days and keep testing 10k. Once we ""pass"", the people who really will make out well are the people who believe the things I'm saying and have been buying in.

No buy you make today will look bad in 5 years - provided you aren't chasing shitcoins for daily gains, or tethering on stupid panic that has no basis.

You want to sell on the US declaring crypto illegal. Sure, that's probably smart. But panic selling because there's a red candle on an SEC internal meeting, and what it ""might"" mean (sky is falling!), that's just stupid.

We're lower today than 2 days ago, but we're more stable, and my buys were ""cheaper"". Overall, in 5 years, I'm going to be better off that I was afforded 2 more days of ""cheaper"" buys. I ain't selling for 5-10 years minimum, so all that matters to me now is cheapest possible buys. I technically only want the price high when I sell - in 5-10 years.

Thing is, you will generally be ""off the record"" until you cash out - if you don't think your FIAT transactions into a bank are not tracked for tax... think again.

So, you may go for years, with your investment increasing and then you decide you want to use that investment to buy something. Hey, maybe you'll be able to do that purchase in cryptocurrency - that would be nice - but that transaction **will** at some point be monitored, unless it's totally off the record, which is, unfortunately, as dodgy as fuck - most retailers will play by the rules.

... and if you haven't kept track of your purchases of crypto, best you start going back through all your trades and start making some spreadsheets.
When the time comes, if you get lucky, you will want an accountant to save you as much tax as possible - and that accountant will want a record of your trading activity. Simple as that.

"Why are you trying to stifle discussion by telling the OP to leave? He clearly made the point that bitcoin does indeed have the traffic to need additional lanes during times of market volatility \(the Dec. bull run\).

Even the prophet Satoshi described a plan to phase in block size increases.

"" It can be phased in, like:

if \(blocknumber \&gt; 115000\)
    maxblocksize = largerlimit


It can start being in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that block number and goes into effect, the older versions that don't have it are already obsolete.


When we're near the cutoff block number, I can put an alert to old versions to make sure they know they have to upgrade. ""

"People ignoring crypto taxes are dumber than a box of rocks. Tax guidelines have been released long before taxes were due. Sites like Coinbase have released tools to help you calculate capital gains/losses. The IRS can come after you FOREVER for tax fraud. Paying taxes does ultimately help keep the society you live in running and more importantly allows the cryptocurrency you own to keep working by means of the internet. If you willfully didn't pay taxes this year its (1) a crime and (2) because you are greedy. Plain and simple.

Now whether or not its economical for the IRS to come after you is the real question. But they can come after you FOREVER and they will use the PUBLIC blockchain combined with the exchange records they get their hands on to do it.

"&gt; None of the implementations should ever go ""haywire"". ""Multiple implementations"" is fixing a problem that can easily not exist by not ever changing the code for any reason.

Except that never changing the code is a recipe for disaster.  You don't know ahead of time if you've made mistakes, so when you find those mistakes, you need to be able to fix them.  Let's take that 2010 bug where what was it like 150 billion new coins were able to be created out of thin air.  You could say that ""all bugs are official"" and just not fix them, but then the code differs from what people thought it was, and people become afraid to use the network because they can't be assured it will act in the way they thought it would.  So either you have to risk your network being completely useless because it cannot be trusted if bugs aren't allowed to be fixed, or you must have a method of fixing bugs that you identify.  This is precisely why multiple implementations help, because they'll all have *different* bugs, and the fact that the majority of the network considers something invalid is a strong indication to any one implementation that something it did is in fact a bug and not widely viewed as a part of the consensus protocol.

&gt; In my opinion, no changes ever need to be made to bitcoin's implementation (except for the blocksize limit being raised when it's needed).

How do you know when its needed?  Who decides this?  When and how is it implemented?  How is this new code tested, if you're not going to change it again for a long time...

Most people would have agreed with your statement a few years ago, but we all just disagreed on exactly when such an upgrade was ""necessary"".

&gt; The best thing for a decentralized protocol is that the code never changes, ever.

No, the *protocol specification* is what should not change.  That's the social contract that people are agreeing to when they run the software.  They expect the software to follow a certain protocol.  And multiple implementations is what protects that protocol and ensures it acts in a predictable and verifiable way, and that any one software implementation fucking it up won't screw with the protocol or make the protocol act in a way that most people would not consider as part of the protocol.

&gt; Or, if it does have to change, it must do so in such a way that an error is impossible, or at least made to be very unlikely.

So uh you [implied elsewhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8hmqk6/critical_vulnerability_applicable_to_miners_of/dyl6xbz/) that you were a software developer, but I really have a hard time believing a programmer can make such a statement.  It's not possible to write programs where errors are impossible.  Even if your program is solely composed of formally verifiable algorithms, the compilers and hardware of people who run it may contain errors.  And I highly doubt that any software you write is 100% comprised of only formally verifiable code.  Software gets bugs, that's just life.  You can test it all you want, but something's going to fuck it up at some point.  You made a mistake, or the computer you're using flipped a bit in RAM and now the program's data is different, or any number of other reasons....  But somehow, the software does unexpected things.  You have to plan for that.  And in the case of protecting a decentralized protocol, having multiple different implementations is one of the best ways to protect it.",1525715864
"&gt; You really are a cocky piece of work. CINDICATOR. CND, yes, My apologies, I abbreviated it as CIN on here, thankfully I ALSO stated the full name so that it could be discerned still.

Come on, the whitepaper didn't plan a 1MB cap, didn't plan a BCH fork, didn't plan LN, didn't plan Blockstream or Bitcoin.com trying to fight each other.

"There's quite literally only room for one coin to succeed. If Bitcoin moves its solutions off chain it will become more and more profitable to mine Bitcoin Cash instead. If enough hashrate moves to BCH then BTC hashrate will be too low to process transactions and the whole chain will grind to a halt.

I like the idea of ""it's a free market, let both try to succeed!"" but people who are saying that don't really comprehend how mining works. If you take transactions completely off-chain via Lightning there is less incentive to mine BTC and it gets steadily more dangerous to hold the currency in the event of a hashrate ""flippening"".

It cost to send a tx, it seems to be enough to prevent the tragedy of the commons problem.

No indication of that for 80% of BTC history and no indication of for BCH.

I doubt it is a problem.

Fair enough but doesn't explain why BTC block were not full before 2015?

Was bitcoin not useful at that time?

(BTW block limit is 8MB on BCH)

Yes, obviously.

Not a problem, those tx fees goes toward supporting PoW.

I see that.

I saw that from the very beginning.

I always understood it was part of bitcoin, it was not a problem at that time it is not a problem now. 

Many optimisations can help and I don't believe everybody need to run a full node.
With such topology BCH can scale very well actually.

&gt;Literally any application that grows exponentially in popularity/tx/s will always outpace your linear growth model. 

Yes, and that's apply to LN also.

Unless it can grow sub-linearly, it is not fixing this issue.

To use your own term, how can you not see that?

&gt;Even at 1gb. Which doesn't exist. Its just math, you can't even argue this.. google linear vs. exponential curve if you need to brush up on it.

At 1GB we are at visa level, we have a bit of time before getting there.

But yes it would be fucking glorious because that mean BCH would be sustainable on fee alone.

&gt; Uh no its not. Its not even possible...it exists only in a lab and the imaginations of academics. 

I am not sure I understand, do you say 32MB is impossible?

Unless you can be more specific, it is just pure FUD (like nearly all small blocker arguments BTW)

&gt;LN is real here and now for people to touch,use, build on. Again, you are habitually misleading or outright lying.

How come?

He's very good at that one trick, which btw he borrowed from his mentor, which is value investing, buy-low-never-sell, and it's worked out very well. It will work out well forever. He and his shareholders will always be fine if they never stray from that course. 

Insurance is a smart game. Railroads that monopolize specific types of industry transport - amazing. Good for him.

That being said, he's been a grumpy old man that refuses to change since the dawn of computers. He doesn't even want to try to understand them, the Internet or anything involving technology. 

He's missed Microsoft, even though he played Bridge with Gates since the early 90's. 

He missed Amazon. 

He missed Google. 

He missed Facebook. 

He missed LinkedIn. 

He'll continue to keep missing on companies like AirBnB, Uber, Lyft and various other world-changing tech companies. 

And it's not like he was looking for these opportunities and just didn't see them. He flat out dissed them because of valuations or complexity. 

He isn't used to technology and hypergrowth. He wasn't used to the reach the Internet provided and if he was in any other position he'd be paying dearly for the non-chalant ""I don't invest in anything I don't understand"" ethos he's adopted. 

Buffet is a damn dinosaur and it works for him, but he needs to stay out of the fucking news and stop giving people ideas of what ""value"" really is. 

Value in this century is getting into something massive before it's even more massive.

One could argue that even at Uber's current valuation if you were to buy 1% of it right now you'd probably still pull 10x within 5 years after IPO.

He has to see what's happening here and conceptualize the change that's coming. Everything is going digital. One-by-one the things we do daily are being digitized, fulfilled by AI or handled via crowd sourcing.

"Im not religious about bitcoin, i dont even hold any. Just like gold and any other metal. Its driven by pure demand. Like i said before. Gold would have been purely speculative if kings and queens of the world did not announce that gold has value. Reminds me alot of bitcoin. Bitcoin would not have the value it has not without its demand. 

Why are you comparing the use case of a metal and a digital asset? No shit i cant use bitcoin as a metal. I cant use gold as a internet payment method either. The similarity between the two does not come from application. It comes from the fact that both gold and bitcoin have value because people believe they have value. No other reason. Another similarity as a fun fact. Both have a limited supply, which goes on to prove even further, that the only thing driving the value of both thosr assets is pure demand.

"&gt; Buffet doesn't have vision.

Investing only in things he understands is not the same thing as lacking vision. 

&gt;He doesn't understand that new companies are not about fundamentals.

Fundamentals are everything; a good idea in and of itself is worth nothing.

&gt;Companies today are driven by ideation to marketability then scalability and then fundamental placement in the market. 

This is how garbage like EOS and Cardano end up having multi billion dollar market caps. 

&gt;He fails to understand that crypto's value (at it's core) is technology driven. The core value being transmission of verified information &amp; payment. The future is headed towards global, agile and light companies backed by automation systems &amp; manufacturing.

I'm speculating here, but I don't think he fails to realize that. Hypothetically, someone could see the value in blockchain technology while also holding a negative opinion of bitcoin; it could be that the 'best' implementation of the tech has not yet been created.

&gt;He is more stifling American innovation and confusing the public to understand vital technology that will fundamental change the way they interact with each other on a global level. If the rest of the world is adapting blockchain, American will be left behind and worsen their economic future. They won't have many allies against blockchain tech and cryptos. 

This is total nonsense. Are you really suggesting that Buffett has so much influence that he is single-handedly capable of 'stifling American innovation'? 

&gt;He is poisoning the future and letting other developing countries adopt/thrive with this technology. 

What the fuck lol. Is he the Supreme Overlord of the USA in your mind? He's not as influential as you're suggesting.

&gt;His foundation has $4 billion in assets but has not given out billions. Don't be fooled by charitable giving by elites. The Susan Thompson buffet foundation is pro-abortion, gives scholorships to only 100 Nebraska students &amp; doesn't even publish an annual report.

"&gt; i said up to 2015 there was no disagreement about what is bitcoin. there was no disagreement about what consensus rules are and there was no disagreement about which blockchain is bitcoin.
&gt; you're the one that seems to be new around here.

In 2015 the low block limit had economical effect yet.

But I can tell there always already quite a lot of fight about that limit.

&gt; Meaning old node always see them as valid
&gt; which is not a problem

It is a problem because segwit showed you can break consensus rules via a soft fork (by basically ""cheating"" old nodes)

&gt; Yes and that's the problem
&gt; nodes don't have to understand all possible uses of bytes stored on blockchain. 

They have to, otherwise they are not fully validating nodes obviously.

What the point of running a node otherwise? just go SPV..

&gt;they have to enforce consensus rules 

Node don't enforce rules. 

(hell segwit prove node can't even verify consensus rules)

&gt;and segwit transactions don't break those.

They do otherwise old nodes would be fully operational. 

(for example old nodes and segwit one can't even agree on the network block limit.. **that's a consensus rules** and old and new BTC work with a different value for it)

&gt; they are basically zombie nodes
&gt; they are nodes that can still follow the chain even if the chain has more meaning now.

They are SPV wallet.

&gt; point is - segwit doesn't break consensus, all nodes still follow the chain correctly. you're wrong.

Then how do you explain that segwit allow block bigger than 1MB... wasn't it a consensus rule?

"The key point here is a matter of philosophy. I don't feel that compromises in decentralization is okay. I can very well accept that others don't feel the same. Sadly the community is in a religious uproar regarding this and the behavior on both sides is somewhat horrible.

The limitations on LNs are somewhat temporary. You don't actually need to run a full node it's just that you currently need to run a full a node.

Same with watch towers. Since there aren't yet any watch towers we don't yet know the requirements. It might be that watch towers are very simple to run and as such will be everywhere. A problem with the current proposed system is that you have to upload one transaction for every state that the channel has had which could potentially be a bit taxing for the towers. But there was a proposed solution recently where you only need to push the latest state (fully encrypted/anonymized). That would mean that a tower only needs to remember one transaction per channel and that you only need to send data to a watch tower when you know that you will be disconnected for a while.

Ideally the system would work from a phone with SPV style header requests and infrequent state updates to a watch tower or two. And since we're talking lightning you could pay the tower a satoshi or two for the trouble without any problems.

If my choice was to run a node or to run a node+watch tower that might give me a dollar or two then the incentives are clear.

What I just don't understand is the hate and ridicule r/btc has for LN. No matter how you look at it, it's interesting tech. Sure it may fail but the possibilities if it works are marvelous.

If a vast majority of mining nodes could be trusted to forward duplicate transactions, this would make 0 conf much safer. If you don't see a duplicate within 10 or so seconds of the original transaction, you can trust the original will be processed even if a duplicate is broadcast later.

&gt;meanwhile i look around BTC and i do see some guys with this vision, but on a different timeline; but i also see more guys who think the currency's point is to get them rich. who never thought about money in their life but 'got into crypto' last year. who have alarmist nonsense claims like oh boy, the dollar is just about to collapse, based on economics you can verify are faulty by doing basic research into currencies that have actually collapsed.

Lol, seemingly the people who just got into 'crypto' last year are largely the BCH proponents. A cursory glance at account ages in this sub reveals this. Also, this is all largely beside the point and has nothing to do with the discussion at hand.


&gt;why BCH for me is because it's adoptable now, it's the crypto i understood bitcoin to be in 2011, and it has the community that overall i believe is thinking about the problem correctly. i also believe your 2 year comment on LN is more likely to be correct, and i think that is way too long to wait, and if BCH really needs to add that way to scale due to limitations with larger blocks then when the time comes to it they will. all along having built up more adoption along the way.

Lol, there's so little demand for what your referring to here AND, FOR THE LAST TIME, BTC is processing more TXs than BCH. But again, once more, this means of transaction use case that your chasing is not important to most people at this stage and neglects the other aspects of sound money. This, again, is why there's little-to-no demand for BCH. (also, like I said, other projects do this better, so BCH isn't even the obvious choice for this).

&gt;i think it's silly to argue over who is the 'real bitcoin' and do think some of the actions taken have been shady and deceptive. whoever has the most real users will get to stand as the real bitcoin over time. as to why BCH vs. some other alt, the fork brought with it immediate owners and adopters from BTC whether they wanted BCH or not, and BCH is the project as i understand it and the community that is passionate about it as i have understood the currency to be from the start.

This makes no sense. Bitcoin refers to the network and chain, not just the software implementations. It's referring to the consensus rules and chain with contiguous blocks that follow said rules. BTC is Bitcoin, BCH is something else. Plain and simple. You can call it whatever you want but the name always refers to the chain. If BCH had been the primary fork and captured the network on Aug 1, then *it* would be Bitcoin. But that's not what happened. Roger calling it ""Bitcoin"" is maliciously deceptive and everyone knows it.

&gt;it doesn't and neither does BTC. it's a string of meaningless 1s and 0s with less intrinsic value than that of fiat paper money. its value will come from use by merchants and peer transactions. i feel like BCH is far behind, but running harder at this goal.

Again, the intrinsic value is in the strength of it's network. Again, I'd recommend you read that John Pfeffor's [take](https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/john-pfeffer/An+Investor%27s+Take+on+Cryptoassets+v6.pdf) on all of this.

"&gt; For a crypto platform to succeed in disrupting the Creative Industry, it has to work hard to get those Critical mass of users first. Then provide value adds.

Yep, this is exactly what needs to happen. It reminds me of the way Steam was able to become the pc gaming library/platform of choice.

In the early days, the steam software sucked, nobody wanted it. The only reason people put up with it was because it was mandatory for the content users really wanted: Counter-Strike 1.6 and Half-Life 2. From there, more and more users joined for their other games like TF2, Portal, the other Half-Life 2 episodes. They kept adding value with game updates, anticheat, etc. They continued to bring other publisher's games onto their platform. Nowadays a pc game being listed on steam is almost a requirement for any game to sell well (with a few exceptions like blizzard, which I think are starting to try the same thing with activision with things like destiny 2).

What any sort of platform needs to be successful is that same sort of Half-Life 2 launch. Where you have a very anticipated product that everyone is hyped to get, and you make it exclusive to your platform. With enough attention, and if the product really is as anticipated, users will be willing to go to your platform no matter what. Then to keep users coming back and sticking around, you do more of the same. Make more amazing products exclusive to your platform (like TF2 or Portal), while at the same time, bringing in more products from other publishers (using your existing user base to draw them in). Eventually the platform will have everything in one place, you will have a lot of users, and you won't need to make your own exclusive products anymore because anyone that wants to sell anything will have to go through your platform to sell it.

This is the same as what wemark has to do here, although it's not clear how it would be possible to create a product in this case people would be so interested in. Have to look at the people buying photographs like these and evaluating what they look for.

"There is also the case where a single implementation causes every miner on the network to mine on an invalid block, as has happened [back in 2010](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Value_overflow_incident). They all needed to be rolled back, but it didn't really cause any ""financial loss"". Bitcoin in itself is very robust. In the case of multiple implementations, only the buggy implementation would mine the invalid block, while the rest of the network carries on with lower mining rates (although BCH's DAA would sort it out rather quickly, not causing major disruptions to the network).

I don't quite get what you are trying to say. We should go back to only having one reference implementation to the *protocol*? To allow repetition of what has happened with Bitcoin Core? Bitcoin is a protocol, not a software implementation. Having multiple implementations of said protocol decentralizes decision making and increases redundancy in case of failure. Right now, most miners mine with ABC, which wouldn't help redundancy in this case, but having no reference implementation is still a newish development. We need to abandon central planning.

&gt; Of course what I wrote is only important if what we are talking about is a system for distributed consensus. If there's only one miner (Bitmain) and 500 sock puppet full nodes running on Chinese data centers, while we all run SPV wallets and trust everything is fine... well then nothing really matters at all.

"&gt; this is a volatile world and anything can happen too - this could also be like arguing myspace in 2006 is going to be the best social network and last for all time.

Except that open source, consensus based protocols are not *companies*, plain and simple.

&gt;if you are a BTC proponent, the only thing you should really be hoping for in 6 months is that the LN is simple and fast and cheap and legit as all fuck. which i'm skeptical will be the case.

6 months, a year, two years, five. It doesn't really matter. Development happens as it happens. There is no pressing need for *means of exchange* that would supplant the need to retain properties of sound money in order for this tech to be truly valuable. LN is here already and it's certainly fully capable of realizing its scaling ambitions. I see no roadblock to widespread adoption but things take time.

&gt;no, i don't believe that such metrics are available or even good guesstimates. i just know it's universally clear and uncontested that BTC made choices that resulted in high fees and merchants dropping out.

Except that's not clear at all. And if you don't have citations then you're just pulling that out of your ass.

&gt;i agree, the better use cases are for things like remittances, escaping capital controls, mobile banking in financially excluded areas, and escape from mismanaged government currencies. or crypto for black market transactions. nonetheless these are proper organic transactions and currency uses and for crypto to compete with government fiat it needs to start taking them over as well as buying coffee or videogames. it's the whole point of it in the first place, to outcompete with a fully reserved currency. buying these things literally is the use case. HODLing until lambo is not a use case at all. store of value only is not a use case either. ""bitcoin, a store of value system of digital gold"" would have been a white paper tossed in the trash, because it would not have any use. it is the currency being fully reserved and replacing fractional reserve currency and banking that is the entire point of the project.

You can't separate these principle from each other. A means of exchange system is efficiently worthless if it doesn't have store of value properties (see XRP for prime example). BCH is the same, if it doesn't retain decentralization then it doesn't have store of value properties and it's effectively worth nothing (or will/should be). 

&gt;sound money by commonly accepted definition is money whose purchasing power is determined by markets not governments. by this definition even forex determined fiat qualifies although money that is stronger or harder or considered more sound would be by those with more conservative and responsible banks or those with mandates of inflation fighting only vs. dual mandates of inflation fighting and full employment. taking the more austrian approach, sound money is commodity backed money, like gold. both BTC and BCH are analogous to gold as being backed by a fixed commodity with a predictable amount of mining. i don't understand how you think they are economically different here as they are very much the same in this regard. you are right, BCH has no intrinsic value. but neither does BTC. they are such pure play currencies that their use in transactions matters even more than paper money that could double as wallpaper or gold money that could double as jewelry. if BCH was as insecure as you claim it to be it wouldn't still be standing today. i'm guessing you weren't telling people to avoid BTC when they were the same years ago. irregardless they are both fully reserved limited commodity back systems ie. they are certainly both sound money.

You're misunderstanding my point. My point is that projects that are prone to censorship, mutability, capture by a central party are not capable of competing for this property for obvious reasons. BCH is inherently more centralized than BTC so it's in a worse position to defend this property. Plain and simple.

&gt;LN is here today in a painful form. few months, a year, or two? i have no idea how you can possibly claim that something that has harmed adoption is ok because a solution will be ready in 2 years. a currency needs adoption period - there is no reason to hit pause for 2 years. it's not as if fiat or banks are standing still either. even if LN was at 100% of promises today, adoption is still going to be hard - so why on earth would you additionally delay it 2 years? larger blocks now is an immediate short term solution that keeps fees lower which allows for greater adoption right now. are you 100% sure that BCH won't have greater adoption than BTC if LN has to tinker around for 2 years to make it work simply and quickly? maybe you should at least ratched that back to 99%. it will be a serious problem for BTC, with BCH moving along swimmingly next to it. you shouldn't casually dismiss this as impossible nor no big deal.

Uh because code and tech move at the pace they do, not just because people *wish* that it was fully implemented today. Duh. Go ahead and promote BCH but don't lie about the TX throughput differences, even on chain, between the two. Segwit on BTC, even in its current state, is still processing many more TXs and TXs of much greater value than BCH. Period. Your argument doesn't make sense because your premise just goes to show that BTC is still more useful, even on-chain. 

&gt;i hear the digital gold far too often to agree with you on that. i don't know where you came up with network or liquidity requirements for sound money. bitcoin was designed as sound money from day one. it needs people to adopt it to make it work and adoption will find its market rate and purchasing power. but it was designed as sound money from day one, it's fully reserved banking with a limited supply of divisible btc. whether we use it as money at all or just speculate in it like a ponzi is up to us, is already is sound money though, if we simply choose to use it as such.

Wrong. Totally wrong on this one. Bitcoin's ""sound money"" properties are dependent on the integrity of the network, as outlined above. The whitepaper or initial implementation did not qualify as ""sound money"" by any reasonable standard. Money is a network good. Metcalfe's law along with the accumulated PoW difficulty are the important measures here, not just some imaginary conception based on the white paper. This is the whole point of PoW, FFS. To not understand this is a rather large failing on your part. I don't have time to explain this in detail though. I recommend you read that 'investor's take' paper that get's passed around Twitter every so often.

&gt;my comments about gold and time were for the seat it has at the table currently as the currency of last resort. it did not take years to establish itself as a currency; this was done both by people and gold's properties but also largely by governments - just as a new currency can be established immediately today by governments. governments dictate currency and use it to collect taxes and settle debts - and that is certainly what many a government did in the past with gold. the reason bitcoin can't establish itself as currency overnight isn't simply present lacking technical maturity to scale - it's that it requires voluntary adoption, whereas these other currencies had quick and immediate demanded adoption by rulers. note also that if you are in the west, like the US, outside of libertarians there are not even many people that understand/care enough about the fractional reserve fiat system to want to try and even replace it anyway. the greater need and demand for it arises more from countries like venezuela or argentina who have corrupt and incompetent people managing government, economic policy, and monetary policy.



And your point is?

&gt;i don't even consider these peer comparisons and i don't know why you would either. i assume you are because of market cap, which is not even a metric that makes sense to apply to currencies. we don't apply it for USD or EUR not because we don't have a good estimate for money supply but because it's completely meaningless for a currency.

Firstly, LTC is vastly superior to BCH. Secondly, my only point in making these comparisons is in regards to fees and speed. BCH will not compete with these technologies (and many legacy technologies) in terms of fees or speed. Chasing this *means of exchange* use case down the rabbit hole completely is a road to nowhere. 

&gt;furthermore, while BTC and LTC are similar, ETH is not intended to be a currency but something more like gas for running a virtual computer, right? XRP has a specific use case for bank routing. i guess i will lump XMR in with BTC nad LTC though. i see no reason to claim BCH can't hang and as far as i can tell it's still the community most enthused about adoption - right now. i look around and it feels like BCH has people who understand the currency as i do and understood it to be that way from day one. it is the currency as i understood it when i first heard of it in 2011. this sentiment seems shared by many others. i got interested in currencies and banking in 2007, i am not new to thinking about this game.

Because redundant (especially many times redundant) sound money crypto is nonsensical. Money is a network good, as mentioned above. The best form of sound money is one that's universally accepted and distributed, not a multitude of competing projects with more-or-less the same model.

"&gt;I asked Munger if we should dismiss bitcoin completely — and he savaged the cryptocurrency even more.

&gt;“The computer science behind bitcoin is a great triumph of the human mind,” Munger started. “They created a product that’s hard to create more of but not impossible. [But] I see an artificial speculative medium,” he said, in which people can sell it to someone else at a higher value with no intrinsic value behind it. It’s “anti-social, stupid and immoral,” he said.

&gt;“Immoral?” I asked him.

&gt;“Suppose you could make a lot of money trading freshly harvested baby brains. Would you do it?” Munger asked. “To me bitcoin is almost as bad.”

&gt;Anything else, Charlie?

All that's needed is a sensible way to specify policy about fees - as for everything - such as % or absolute amount of blockspace to reserve for this, priority rules for txs to be selected for acceptance as free-qualifying,  like size, coin age, UTXO count creation / destruction etc.

"&gt; There is an upper limit to block size though. One crypto kitties app will max out your blocks 32 mb blocks. 

This is another discussion here.

I tend to disagree with you.

A lot more than 32MB is possible obviously.

At least scaling beyond 32MB is much better understood than LN/L2 scaling (routing/hub liquidity).

&gt;1 gb is highly experimental and only exists in lab conditions right now. 

It is.

We have time before getting there.

&gt;They have 2 years left in a 3 year academic grant to research this scenario but there is no guarantee of a commercially viable product when they are done.

&gt;What you don't seem to understand is there is no such thing as a blockchain without a fee market. A limited shared public resource (whether it is 1mb or 1gb ) will become full if it is useful.

So you say.

I fail to see indication of that.

Everything I read against onchain is FUD or huge exaggeration (onchain scaling is impossible because 1GB are impossible therefore 1MB need to stay forever).

Funny enough the same person that argue onchain scaling is impossible fail to see the huge scaling challenge LN/L2 solutions are facing for some reasons.

&gt;At which point a fee market will exist. You can't avoid a fee market when you have finite shared public resources. This applies to the physical world and the digital.

There might be a fee market in the future, as long as it keep fee low enough to be negligible and keep the bitcoin as P2P ecash I have nothing against it.

Huffman while he was a Sc.D. student at MIT, and published in the 1952 paper ""A Method for the Construction of Minimum-Redundancy Codes"".

The output from Huffman's algorithm can be viewed as a variable-length code table for encoding a source symbol (such as a character in a file). The algorithm derives this table from the estimated probability or frequency of occurrence (weight) for each possible value of the source symbol.

The day no troll slurs ""BCash"" as ad-hominem, is the day that I'll agree that Roger should change ""Bitcoin Core"" back to Bitcoin; until then: hypocrites begone!

How is that trolling? ""BCash"" is a better name and many (most) people refer to it as such. I didn't realize that its name was decided by a central party. Silly me, I though that we were talking about open source software and free markets. Whether you call if Bitcoin Cash or BCash really shouldn't matter, so long as people know what you're referring to, which they most certainly do. But go ahead, be a *name nazi*, that's surely a great look.

&gt;I also disagree with your opinion that ""the skillful developers"" remained on the incumbent chain. There are plenty of skillful developers on both chains, but trolls refuse to recognise that lest they suffer from cognitive dissonance. But hey, you have a right to your opinion, even if it's set in stone through your own biases.

Who's on the BCH side? The psychopath Rizun? Gavin, the ""I don't understand how to verify whether someone is Satoshi"" Andresen? ~~CSW~~ Satoshi himself?

&gt;I think we got to the bottom of your real issue here. It's not with Jamie, it's your vendetta against Bitcoin Cash and Roger Ver. You don't give a shit about ""journalistic integrity""...if you did you'd be on Fox News subreddits and The_Donald calling it out- the fact that you're not shows why you're here: to sow discord on this sub by starting quarrels or upsetting people...you know, the actual meaning of Internet troll which is exactly what I called you.

Sure, buddy. I guess you can read my mind. In reality, I'm banned from TheDonald (not surprising) and it never occurred to me to visit a FoxNews subreddit. But go ahead, pretend to be able to read my mind and understand what my ethical standards are. Where did you acquire these telepathy skills?

&gt;Blatantly false. There was no airdrop and you know it. The network forked in two directions: Bitcoin Cash, and Bitcoin with Segwit. The network no longer exists as it did, and the incumbents retained the name.

Did you not see me put *air dropped* in quotes? I understand that it wasn't actually air dropped, my point is that it was a dividend that showed up out of nowhere for hodlers.

&gt;It's much much stronger than Bitcoin, and is aiming for that number 1 spot. If it was as weak as you say you'd be happy to ignore it.

Lol, again, this mind-reading is intense. The truth that I find it fascinating to interact with BCash proponents. A favorite insult/allegations/whathaveyou for said group of people is to claim that I'm ""fearful"" or ""worried"" about BCH. I can assure you I'm not. I just find it really interesting to try to tease out the motives and strategies of BCash proponents, particular in this sub. If I were fearful or something I would just diversify my portfolio back into BCH, but I haven't and likely won't.

&gt;""Consensus"" - ha ha ha! Everyone outside of your little echo chamber is still calling on Bitcoin to increase the blocksize. Listen to industry experts from sources outside of Blockstream control. Read the blogs of the CEO's of major Bitcoin businesses. Listen to podcasts like those on the LTB network. Watch how people like Antonopolous tiptoe around the issue. Listen to Vitalik. If you really think you have consensus now that Bitcoin Cash is here, you're delusional!

I think you're really misunderstanding what PoW consensus actually means. BCH is the contentious fork, rejected by the network. BTC is the non-contentious, consensus-agreed side of the fork. There's really no other way to spin this, though you can certainly try.

&gt;👍

Yeah, go ahead and defend your use of laughably overused ad-homs. It's a fantastic look for someone who's trying to be taken seriously on a subject where they are in the vast minority. I'm sure you're likely to convince many people with this type of discourse. ",1525709208

"You missed the point I was reacting to:

&gt; There is no ability to extract the private keys from the notes.

If both of these statements are true, then that means there is no possible way to extract or transfer the bitcoins out of the paper.

As a consequence, That then implies two things....

(1) The holder of the paper never actually gains control of the Bitcoins ---  If you agree to pay me Bitcoins,  and I don't agree to accept suspicious pieces of paper, and you're holding one of these pieces of paper,  there is no way for you to meet your obligation to pay me.   There HAS to be a way to either obtain the private key or  a mechanism for spending the actual Bitcoin value on the paper for  them to be truly Bitcoins (even if  using that mechanism breaks a tamper-seal or otherwise destroys that note,  so that it is required to be evident some of its value could have been spent).

(2) With no way to extract the value from the paper: there's nothing to stop the creator from making 2 or 3 pieces of paper with the same public address,  or setting up a ruse where they control the private keys and will go back and gradudally all their value for themself 10 years later.   This would be very difficult to detect....   

(3) If you can't extract the Bitcoin value from the paper,  then it's really just fiat!

"&gt;So if number of users doubles, network usage doubles, bandwidth/RAM requirements double

Right and right.

&gt; so the number of miners required to keep the network running doubles?

Not quite. The number of miners can remain the same, even as full node resource requirements increase. Just because it costs more to run a node doesn't mean we ""need"" more miners.

Of course, the more different miners that are running, the better, because that means more mining decentralization (which strengthens Bitcoin). But technically Bitcoin can keep running even if it costs too much for almost anyone to run a node, and it winds up being one miner mining every block. This scenario would be a bad thing (and I personally would consider it to represent ""Bitcoin failing to be what it was supposed to be"") but the blockchain would still continue to grow and function.

&gt;Sorry once again, I realise that I'm taking a very user-centric (as opposed to miner-centric) view on this but around 21st Dec 2017 network usage was so high that, while TX were effectively processed at the same rate as usual, the fees were so high that from a user perspective confirmation time dramatically increased per BTC spent?

Ah, yes, that makes sense.

&gt;Surely this is a balance? High difficulty secures the network but it also increases the overall cost to everyone? And I guess the equilibrium I then refer to is about finding this balance that makes bitcoin both usable for users and profitable for miners?

That also makes sense, and is a good point.

&gt;So by this final sentence do you mean that bitcoin should be designed so that it makes sense for regular bitcoin savers/transactors/users to run their own nodes? Or just that they should be able to afford to pay miners to run them?

I don't think users should *have* to run their own nodes, but that they should be *able* to. As long as it remains possible and reasonably affordable to self-validate the chain and your own transactions on the network (and as long as miners remain reasonably well distributed), Bitcoin's peer-to-peer foundations remain strong, and the decentralized model continues to work as intended. That doesn't mean that every user *must* run a node, just that they must remain *able* to if they want to.

If the cost to self-validate gets out of the reach of normal users and businesses, then trust leaks back into the system (i.e. every user must trust a node-runner to validate the consensus rules on their behalf), which robs Bitcoin of its unique properties, and renders it vulnerable to centralized control. In the extreme example, where one company is the only one running any nodes, they would be the rulers of Bitcoin and have full control of the system; they would be able to generate infinite coins, take people's money at will, prevent some users from transacting, or anything at all, really. The reason no single company, government, or entity can do that now is because others who are running full nodes would reject their efforts, making it costly and useless to even attempt. If running a node is impossible for anyone but them, this all-important factor disappears.",1525709017

"1. no, i don't believe that such metrics are available or even good guesstimates.  i just know it's universally clear and uncontested that BTC made choices that resulted in high fees and merchants dropping out.

2. i agree, the better use cases are for things like remittances, escaping capital controls, mobile banking in financially excluded areas, and escape from mismanaged government currencies.  or crypto for black market transactions.  nonetheless these are proper organic transactions and currency uses and for crypto to compete with government fiat it needs to start taking them over as well as buying coffee or videogames.  it's the whole point of it in the first place, to outcompete with a fully reserved currency.  buying these things literally is the use case.  HODLing until lambo is not a use case at all.  store of value only is not a use case either.  ""bitcoin, a store of value system of digital gold"" would have been a white paper tossed in the trash, because it would not have any use.  it is the currency being fully reserved and replacing fractional reserve currency and banking that is the entire point of the project.

3. sound money by commonly accepted definition is money whose purchasing power is determined by markets not governments.  by this definition even forex determined fiat qualifies although money that is stronger or harder or considered more sound would be by those with more conservative and responsible banks or those with mandates of inflation fighting only vs. dual mandates of inflation fighting and full employment.  taking the more austrian approach, sound money is commodity backed money, like gold.  both BTC and BCH are analogous to gold as being backed by a fixed commodity with a predictable amount of mining.

i don't understand how you think they are economically different here as they are very much the same in this regard.  you are right, BCH has no intrinsic value.  but neither does BTC.  they are such pure play currencies that their use in transactions matters even more than paper money that could double as wallpaper or gold money that could double as jewelry.  if BCH was as insecure as you claim it to be it wouldn't still be standing today.  i'm guessing you weren't telling people to avoid BTC when they were the same years ago.  irregardless they are both fully reserved limited commodity back systems ie. they are certainly both sound money.

4. LN is here today in a painful form.  few months, a year, or two?  i have no idea how you can possibly claim that something that has harmed adoption is ok because a solution will be ready in 2 years.  a currency needs adoption period - there is no reason to hit pause for 2 years.  it's not as if fiat or banks are standing still either.  even if LN was at 100% of promises today, adoption is still going to be hard - so why on earth would you additionally delay it 2 years?  larger blocks now is an immediate short term solution that keeps fees lower which allows for greater adoption *right now*.

are you 100% sure that BCH won't have greater adoption than BTC if LN has to tinker around for 2 years to make it work simply and quickly?  maybe you should at least ratched that back to 99%.  it will be a serious problem for BTC, with BCH moving along swimmingly next to it.  you shouldn't casually dismiss this as impossible nor no big deal.

5. i hear the digital gold far too often to agree with you on that.  i don't know where you came up with network or liquidity requirements for sound money.  bitcoin was designed as sound money from day one.  it needs people to adopt it to make it work and adoption will find its market rate and purchasing power.  but it was designed as sound money from day one, it's fully reserved banking with a limited supply of divisible btc.  whether we use it as money at all or just speculate in it like a ponzi is up to us, is already is sound money though, if we simply choose to use it as such.

my comments about gold and time were for the seat it has at the table currently as the currency of last resort.  it did not take years to establish itself as a currency; this was done both by people and gold's properties but also largely by governments - just as a new currency can be established immediately today by governments.  governments dictate currency and use it to collect taxes and settle debts - and that is certainly what many a government did in the past with gold.  the reason bitcoin can't establish itself as currency overnight isn't simply present lacking technical maturity to scale - it's that it requires voluntary adoption, whereas these other currencies had quick and immediate demanded adoption by rulers.  note also that if you are in the west, like the US, outside of libertarians there are not even many people that understand/care enough about the fractional reserve fiat system to want to try and even replace it anyway.  the greater need and demand for it arises more from countries like venezuela or argentina who have corrupt and incompetent people managing government, economic policy, and monetary policy.

&gt; BCH simply doesn't stand up to BTC or even LTC, XMR, ETH or XRP.  It's weaker than all these other offerings, so why? 

i don't even consider these peer comparisons and i don't know why you would either.  i assume you are because of market cap, which is not even a metric that makes sense to apply to currencies.  we don't apply it for USD or EUR not because we don't have a good estimate for money supply but because it's completely meaningless for a currency.

furthermore, while BTC and LTC are similar, ETH is not intended to be a currency but something more like gas for running a virtual computer, right?  XRP has a specific use case for bank routing.  i guess i will lump XMR in with BTC nad LTC though.  i see no reason to claim BCH can't hang and as far as i can tell it's still the community most enthused about adoption - right now.  i look around and it feels like BCH has people who understand the currency as i do and understood it to be that way from day one.  it is the currency as i understood it when i first heard of it in 2011.  this sentiment seems shared by many others.  i got interested in currencies and banking in 2007, i am not new to thinking about this game.

meanwhile i look around BTC and i do see some guys with this vision, but on a different timeline; but i also see more guys who think the currency's point is to get them rich.  who never thought about money in their life but 'got into crypto' last year.  who have alarmist nonsense claims like oh boy, the dollar is just about to collapse, based on economics you can verify are faulty by doing basic research into currencies that have actually collapsed.

why BCH for me is because it's adoptable now, it's the crypto i understood bitcoin to be in 2011, and it has the community that overall i believe is thinking about the problem correctly.  i also believe your 2 year comment on LN is more likely to be correct, and i think that is way too long to wait, and if BCH really needs to add that way to scale due to limitations with larger blocks then when the time comes to it they will.  all along having built up more adoption along the way.

&gt; Is it just because of the name ""Bitcoin"" or because of the shared chain prior to Aug 1?

i think it's silly to argue over who is the 'real bitcoin' and do think some of the actions taken have been shady and deceptive.  whoever has the most real users will get to stand as the real bitcoin over time.  as to why BCH vs. some other alt, the fork brought with it immediate owners and adopters from BTC whether they wanted BCH or not, and BCH is the project as i understand it and the community that is passionate about it as i have understood the currency to be from the start.

&gt; Why does it have any intrinsic value?

it doesn't and neither does BTC.  it's a string of meaningless 1s and 0s with less intrinsic value than that of fiat paper money.  its value will come from use by merchants and peer transactions.  i feel like BCH is far behind, but running harder at this goal.",1525708559
"&gt; 1MB was implemented later
&gt; fuck your pedantry. 1MB was implemented and it was part of the consensus rules for long time. 9 or 8 - doesn't matter. 

It matter very much, making this limit permanent fundamentally the economic characteristic of bitcoin.

It was implemented as a temporary limit to protect the network against DDoS in its early stage.

&gt;what matters is that for you to continue claiming what you're claiming you have to deny a simple historical fact - up until 2015 there was no disagreement about what is bitcoin.

Are you joking? Sorry but are new to bitcoin?

It has **always** been under question, from day 1 the limit has been implemented peoples predicted it is risky and likely to create problem in the future.

&gt; nope, you don't understand how segwit works.
&gt; segwit transactions are valid bitcoin transactions from perspective of old node. 

Yes Segwit transaction use ANYCANSPEND tx format.

Meaning old node always see them as valid (SPV), they simply cannot check signature data.

&gt;old node just doesn't understand what goes on behind those bitcoins changing hands.

Yes and that's the problem.

&gt;new nodes know that and make sure to validate things.

Yes, that's why old node are downgraded to SPV security. 

They also can't propagate transactions to other (as they would propagate tx without signature data)... they are basically zombie nodes, unable to fully audit the chain anymore, unable to propagate tx..

I agree.

Though the block limit is sufficiently high above actual capacity usage that fees stay low (read the first page of the white paper), which is the way bitcoin worked for its most part of its past. (Well before the whole small block/settlements layer things)

BTC departed from that, do you disagree?

No, A block limit high enough to not influence fees is in accordance with the original economics characteristics and incentives. (I would certainly like to see the limit removed but we are heading in the right direction).

"&gt;Plenty accept Nano and that's a fact.

Please give me a few reputable brands that take NANO as payment. Because I know of plenty of website who take IOTA as payment as well but they're just small websites who's owners are into crypto. 

Nano (fast, fee-less, and CENTRALIZED) isn't a great selling point fam. Nobody wants to accept a coin as payment that is centralized by the devs. 

All I'm saying is that NANO doesn't work now as it's centralized. Might as well use Ripple, fees there are 0.000001 cent or something close to that.

Nano is not a currency YET. It needs to be decentralized for it to have an actual selling point.  I like IOTA because of other reasons where NANO can't even compete but I don't like NANO fanboys spreading false info everywhere saying Nano &gt; IOTA. At this current time, the coins just can't compete as they're not a finished product yet. Nano may be fast but it's centralized so it makes it useless as a cryptoCURRENCY. Everything I said can be said about IOTA as well just so you don't think im a bland fan. Also the market has shown that it's far more favorable towards IOTA than it is towards NANO.

Otherwise a new team in charge of developing Bitcoin could decide to change it to be a mobile game about cats, or a crippled settlement network that depends on vaporware and propaganda.

"It's short-sighted to call crypto ""rat-poison"" without truly understanding it's inner workings and the bigger picture. He should have simply stated that he wouldn't be entering crypto because it doesn't conform with his investment strategies. Personally I heavily invest in real estate and work in the industry. I can't wait until blockchain really enters our industry and causes some much needed change. But I don't heavily invest in things I don't know. Although I am taking a bigger risk and investing in Bitcoin. 

What's surprising to me is that he owns a real estate company. One way or another he will be impacted significantly by blockchain technology. There's a company called Rentberry that's implementing blockchain to make transactions easier and more transparent. These types of platforms will directly affect his real estate business one way or another. 

Now, maybe he just thinks the crypto currency is pure speculation and is overvalued but believes in blockchain as a practical technology. I don't know. But I do know the guy has been really smart with his investments and that counts for something. ",1525704404

Nobody was having any issues trying to transfer out BTC and their coins not being there.  The issue was payment processing and yes some people wondered if their money (fiat) had been misappropriated. I was not aware of people being concerned about bitcoins being taken.

"I feel like the fundamental problem with the blockchain is that it's trying to fix problems it created and not real life problems.

You have EOS trying to fix problems of ETH (like scalability). You have ETH trying to fix problems of Bitcoin. You have some coin trying to fix the problems of some other coin.

While no coin solves real problems.

You keep reading everyday. ""X COIN makes a deal with the Health Ministry of Ehtiopia!! Y coin to be implemented in tracking ships in Malaysia""

There's no problem with tracking ships. A database works fine. There's no problem in storing patients information in hospitals. A database works fine.

There's no problem in buying stuff online. Credit Cards work fine. 

After 8 years and no real life application yet, blockchain is desperately trying to find problems to solve, and there are none, yet.",1525704238
But he is just as correct about crypto as he is about gold. ,1525704220
"But BTC also has flaws no other has. The ability to loose all money with a data loss, the ability to get tracked by a 3rd party who is able to charge your gains and finally the big one, ever increasing demand for electricity and hardware to maintain the system that already consumes as much as a small country. It is literally dirty money.

Now I'm not saying crypto isn't the future, but not in it's current form by any stretch of the imagination is BTC ready for the big time.",1525704206
"Thanks for your comment!

We posted a shorter post on the same issue some time ago where we highlighted why the world-wide adoption and the community building is so important for the success of the crypto.

You may like it as one of your points above is in tune with what we wrote:

Fiat money is a state institution, it derives its value from a government that enforces a currency as a legal tender. Cryptocurrencies are civil institutions, they derive their value from a mutually agreed consensus of voluntarily cooperating individuals. Fiat is backed by governments, cryptos are backed by independent communities. This is the fundamental difference. Fiat is the police, crypto is neighborhood watch. Fiat is tax — crypto is donation. Fiat is the army — crypto is militia.

I don't disagree with your sentiment that cryptocurrency investing is extremely risky and that nobody should be investing more than they're willing to lose.

I do disagree that right now is a bad time to invest. If you've been following cryptocurrency news you'd see that there are a lot of positive signs. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are both racing to be the first into the cryptocurrency market and Goldman Sachs admits it is already running a cryptocurrency Desk. Goldman Sachs backed Circle has bought Poloniex, one of the largest exchanges.

Coinbase is recording record profits and is opening private investment and is opening up [Coinbase Custody](https://custody.coinbase.com/) for institutional investment, as well as a [Coinbase Index](https://am.coinbase.com/) for investing in cryptocurrency as an index. Not only that, Coinbase is waiting for SEC clarity on tokens so that they can start adding more coins to their exchange and for their custodial clients.

On the technical side of things, great strides are being made in the move to Proof of Stake from Proof of Work in Ethereum and Bitcoin has made huge progress in solving immediate scalability issues. Ethereum is also moving towards some solutions for huge scaling progress. The first proper dApp ever has been successfully released, known as DigixDAO, a gold backed token which can be redeemed for real gold and has proof of asset of each bar being held in a highly trusted vault in Singapore. The holders of DGD will be allowed to participate as a decentralized autonomous organization and will receive rewards for doing so.

Cryptocurrency development is really booming right now and the investment side of things is ramping up for the institutional investor.

This is of course, an opinion, based on what I've been following. It's risky. Nobody should put all of their eggs in one basket but only with taking risks can you be granted huge reward. If you don't take risks you don't get appropriate rewards, or losses, of course.",1525703296
"Well, I mean, if he's talking about the education system that prepares our children for mindless drudgery then the answer to his question is ""you already do it.""

""We should do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to earn a living. It is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living. We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian Darwinian theory he must justify his right to exist. So we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors. **The true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living.**"" — Buckminster Fuller

Sounds to me like the world would be a much better place if Munger and his ilk took Bucky's advice and go back to school.

Maybe he could start by addressing his technological illiteracy and [learning to code](https://www.codecademy.com).

Until then, our stock response to ignorant people telling us what to think and feel ought be ""Do you actually know anything about computer science?  Have you ever used a bitcoin wallet?  Can you code?  Do you know what a BIP is?"" etc.

If the answers are no, asking their opinions on all this is akin to asking the Janitors working at the large hadron collider what they think about the latest functional specification drafts for the worldwide LHC compute grid.

Most of those janitors would of course be humble enough to shrug and say ""not my field of expertise or interest, but if you want to know about how toilet plumbing works, I'm your gal""...

"&gt; No matter how wide of a band you can get you can't get blocks to the other side of the world faster than lightspeed.

Lightspeed is pretty fast. Not as fast as my car, but pretty close. :)
(Light speed will get you around the planet 7.5x in 1 second).

But, I think bandwidth between nodes is the key point here, right? For a 10 minute block time you'd want blocks to fully propagate in a minute or less, I would think, to be safe (though I just pulled that number out my ass). But the point is, I can conceive that there is a practical limit, right now, with the current internet. That said, things will improve over time. The question (and current assumption by BCH) is that it will stay ahead of the requirements.

&gt; If you look at the amount of transactions handled by banks, Visa, Mastercard and so on it is growing faster than a distributed ledger system can grow. 

Anywhere I can find numbers on that? Seems like something that needs real numbers, documented assumptions etc, to be more than just anecdotal.

&gt; Having a few massive datacenter nodes running the entire system because blocks become too large is centralized.

Agree there, but merchants who are economically invested in the system could run their own nodes. That would mean more nodes and an increase in de-centralization. I was never a fan of the idea that every end user needs to be able to run a full node. Sure it's cool to be able to, but be happy to give that up if it meant a network that could scale better.

&gt; LN is slightly more centralized than bitcoin but that's okay because the fallback for lighting is always on-chain.

Right now it feels like that will be one crowded highway down the track. I guess time will tell.

&gt; Cryptocurrency needs to be decentralized and trustless before anything else. I feel that the current path of bch is sacrificing these properties in order to achieve better usability and that will hurt massively in the long run.

I'm on the fence myself. I agree with de-centralized and trustless, but not so sure I fully buy all your arguments. Plus, you shouldn't under-rate usability. I woke up from a dream the other night wondering just how the feck people in 3rd world countries are ever going to use LN, owing to the fact you have to run your own node/watch tower and a whole bunch of other nonsense like needing redundancy in watch towers. I can much more easily see the simplicity of BCH's approach, playing out, in that kind of environment. All you need is a mobile phone.

Thanks for the civilized chat.

"&gt; No, that sounds like a non sequitur to me. Why would you assume this to be the case?
Sorry, I appreciate that this assumption is wrong but why so based on what's been said so far:
&gt;both bandwidth and RAM requirements can be modeled as O(N), meaning that they scale linearly according to network usage
So if number of users doubles, network usage doubles, bandwidth/RAM requirements double, so the number of miners required to keep the network running doubles?
&gt;I am not sure what you're referring to here. The network didn't really meaningfully ""slow down"" towards the end of 2017 (and by no means would an influx of users cause it to do so).
Sorry once again, I realise that I'm taking a very user-centric (as opposed to miner-centric) view on this but around 21st Dec 2017 network usage was so high that, while TX were effectively processed at the same rate as usual, the fees were so high that from a user perspective confirmation time dramatically increased per BTC spent?
&gt;Difficulty increasing is not a problem (in fact, it's a good thing
Surely this is a balance? High difficulty secures the network but it also increases the overall cost to everyone? And I guess the equilibrium I then refer to is about finding this balance that makes bitcoin both usable for users and profitable for miners?
&gt;people obsess over a but forget about b
Yes, as with all your posts you have answered all my queries and given a great summary at the end. This paragraph makes the most important point and has definitely improved the way I think about bitcoin and clarifies my thinking on the equilibrium I'm thinking about.
&gt;In short, if people can't afford to use Bitcoin in a trust-minimizing manner (which means ""run a fully-validating node"") then we have a system failure, and have lost the crucial ""decentralization"" property that made Bitcoin so special.
So by this final sentence do you mean that bitcoin should be designed so that it makes sense for regular bitcoin savers/transactors/users to run their own nodes? Or just that they should be able to afford to pay miners to run them?
Thanks for all the time you've put into your explanations, hopefully it helps other people too :)",1525702350

Right now, there is zero ceiling. The moment Chinese government opens the doors, the ceiling rises exponentially. China will NOT be left behind on the next world changing technology, so it's inevitable that it will happen, it's just a question of when and how. TKY is solving the HOW.

There's really nothing worse than a full ban, which is what it looks like today. I mean, it's not like China can come out and ""ban"" crypto. So you are really buying into the ground floor worst case scenario for Chinese coins. There's only room to move up.

No, no it doesn't. It's hundreds of privately minted coins or tokens with artificially limited supply caps (and forks when they please) that is hyper-inflationary and hyper-deflationary (volatile) 

This makes it next to useless as a stable currency (consumers, business and industry will never choose a volatile currency over a stable one)

The insane volatility makes loans, debt, new issues, etc next to impossible. In times of heavy inflation/deflation there is nothing that could be done, likewise if there was an economic crash, we'd all be at the mercy of speculators

&gt;That and you have things like Payfair now, which is a decentralized escrow service and P2P exchange.

"edited for clarity.

there's already a lot of batching going on today, bitcoin becoming a settlement layer has been the whole idea, so 1 transaction in bitcoin is already equivalent to 2\-3 transactions in ethereum or bcash today. [https://outputs.today/](https://outputs.today/)",1525701183
"Depends on where you see the spikes, on centralised exchanges, ignoring the possibility of a glitch, the large spike would be due to someone buying deep into the order book. The order book is the list of orders at a certain price for a certain amount. It'll always fulfil the best price as much as possible into the order book. If you look at the order book on any exchange and scroll down, you can see how much cumulative Bitcoin there is at a certain price point. If you want to drop the price to that point instantly you'll need to buy all the way down the book to that amount.

On a decentralised exchange, they don't generally work by this principal. They will execute the order at whatever price you set, so what often happens is someone accidentally mixes up the buy price with the amount and makes a terrible trade for them and an amazing deal for someone else.",1525701182
"The block time is set to allow blocks to propagate the network without getting too many orphan blocks. Other cryptocurrencies like eth uses an uncle system to include orphan blocks but bitcoin doesn't.

Bitcoin is a distributed ledger. In order for it to work every node needs to have the same ledger. At some point the propagation of blocks will take longer than the creation of blocks which leads to fatal fragmentation. The propagation capacity has a hard limit with regards to lightspeed. No matter how wide of a band you can get you can't get blocks to the other side of the world faster than lightspeed.

If you look at the amount of transactions handled by banks, Visa, Mastercard and so on it is growing faster than a distributed ledger system can grow. This is a key reason why ""small blockers"" feel that we have to maximize block capacity per byte before we increase blocks. Offloading the ledger with layer 2 systems is in my opinion the better way to go. There are other solutions like sharding and proof of stake that can also increase transaction capacity.

Having a few massive datacenter nodes running the entire system because blocks become too large is centralized. And in comparison with existing centralized systems, like VISA, the blockchain is horribly inefficient. Heck the blockchain is horrible compared to a basic mysql install for speed and capacity.

I want bitcoin to be decentralized to prevent authority attack. I am well prepared to sacrifice transaction numbers in order to keep decentralization because without decentralization bitcoin is nothing.

LN is slightly more centralized than bitcoin but that's okay because the fallback for lighting is always on-chain.

Cryptocurrency needs to be decentralized and trustless before anything else. I feel that the current path of bch is sacrificing these properties in order to achieve better usability and that will hurt massively in the long run.",1525701162

And [the code which disabled it](https://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/code/140/tree/trunk/main.cpp#l522)(""for now"").

And Satoshi's own justification for [why he intended transactions to be replaceable](https://pastebin.com/JF3USKFT).

&gt;It's for contracts.  An unrecorded open transaction can keep being replaced until nLockTime.  It may contain payments by multiple parties.  Each input owner signs their input.  For a new version to be written, each must sign a higher sequence number (see IsNewerThan).  By signing, an input owner says ""I agree to put my money in, if everyone puts their money in and the outputs are this.""  There are other options in SignatureHash such as SIGHASH_SINGLE which means ""I agree, as long as this one output (i.e. mine) is what I want, I don't care what you do with the other outputs."".  If that's written with a high nSequenceNumber, the party can bow out of the negotiation except for that one stipulation, or sign SIGHASH_NONE and bow out completely.
&gt;
&gt; The parties could create a pre-agreed default option by creating a higher nSequenceNumber tx using OP_CHECKMULTISIG that requires a subset of parties to sign to complete the signature.  The parties hold this tx in reserve and if need be, pass it around until it has enough signatures.
&gt;
&gt; One use of nLockTime is high frequency trades between a set of parties.  They can keep updating a tx by unanimous agreement.  The party giving money would be the first to sign the next version.  If one party stops agreeing to changes, then the last state will be recorded at nLockTime.  If desired, a default transaction can be prepared after each version so n-1 parties can push an unresponsive party out.  Intermediate transactions do not need to be broadcast.  Only the final outcome gets recorded by the network.  Just before nLockTime, the parties and a few witness nodes broadcast the highest sequence tx they saw.",1525700609

"**Zipf's law**

Zipf's law () is an empirical law formulated using mathematical statistics that refers to the fact that many types of data studied in the physical and social sciences can be approximated with a Zipfian distribution, one of a family of related discrete power law probability distributions. Zipf distribution is related to the zeta distribution, but is not identical.

For example, Zipf's law states that given some corpus of natural language utterances, the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table. Thus the most frequent word will occur approximately twice as often as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent word, etc.: the rank-frequency distribution is an inverse relation.

***

**Most common words in English**

Studies that estimate and rank the most common words in English examine texts written in English. Perhaps the most comprehensive such analysis is one that was conducted against the Oxford English Corpus (OEC), a very large collection of texts from around the world that are written in the English language. A text corpus is a large collection of written works that are organised in a way that makes such analysis easier.

In total, the texts in the Oxford English Corpus contain more than 2 billion words.

No it's not. In fact for all but the most technical or those who want to learn how the protocol works - who gives a shit about block caps, block sizes etc...

They should never have any relevance ever on any use of the coin as the idea of block size limitations should not be required to be know by users as they'll never reach them or see them reached as we'll just raise the limit again way before we get close to it.

The London Beer Flood happened on 17 October 1814 in the parish of St. Giles, London, England. At the Meux and Company Brewery in Tottenham Court Road, a huge vat containing over 135,000 imperial gallons (610,000 L) of beer ruptured, causing other vats in the same building to succumb in a domino effect. As a result, more than 323,000 imperial gallons (1,470,000 L) of beer burst out and gushed into the streets.

Hmm, yeah its puzzling how people get scammed into buying shitcoins huh.",1525699457
"&gt;Just because no one owns the name doesn’t mean you can’t mislead/scam people.

If you were told Bitcoin was fast, cheap and had reliable transactions, and you got transaction prices that range from a few cents to 85$ and sometimes don’t go through because your fee wasn’t high enough, you were mislead. I’ve spoken to people that have invested in BTC, but never actually made a transaction (they just left it on the exchange). They think it’s fast and reliable, many of them don’t even know how high the fees got. 

Bitcoin Cash is the original version that Satoshi put forth. Blocks were always meant to get bigger, this is extremely clear if you take the time to read some of what Satoshi has said on it. Bitcoin Cash is gaining adoption fast after it was forced to basically build itself from the ground up. I wouldn’t be so quick to dismiss it. ",1525699441

They can trade a ""cross-currency swap"" for, say, BTC-EUR just as easily as EUR-USD. They'll make money anyway...",1525699410

"Stop wording it as ""improvements"".

Blockstream (a third party, profit making company), wanted 2nd layer solutions, which was never the plan, and just makes some people richer.

The community, and Gavin Anderson (the developer who Satoshi passed lead development of Bitcoin down too), wanted to instead increase block size limits. Note 2 things : A this doesn't actually increase block sizes, it just increases THE LIMIT. I.e, in a very heavy load situation, we can use bigger blocks to keep the network fast and cheap. Secondly, the 1mb initial limit was a temporary measure put in by Satoshi to stop spam attacks. It was evidently temporary.

So the community wanted a small change in block size limits, in order to keep BTC fast, and Blockstream promised 2nd layer solutions, but taking forever to. Implement them, keeping fees high so their miners made a crap ton of money.

Now, BCH has become the coin the community wanted, and BTC became the coin that those with power money and influence wanted. What a massive surprise which one won, and people think is the true one. I hate censorship and third party control. I guess you love it. ",1525699238

"&gt; Someone doesn't have to ""hate"" modern fiat/economics/finance/banking just because they support crypto. It's not ""them vs us"".

It is. Crypto advocates a differente way to approach monetary policy. Its a very direct attack on the fiat system. It allows people to protect themselves against inflation attacks by the government.

&gt; It's an asset that is divisible and can be used as a type of money. We hoard it and speculate on it. It doesn't represent an economic system anymore than Dogecoin does.

I remember when the CEO of Yahoo was asked what her primary aim was many years ago: ""to increase revenues for shareholders"" was the response.  When Google were asked the same thing, the reply was ""to make sense of all the world's information.""

The Wright brothers, Nikola Tesla... None of these people were motivated by money.  Neither is Ray Kurzweil (now chief of Google engineering).

Yes Bitcoin Cash has lower onchain fees. On chain means that you can do a transaction without having to trust anyone else.

"Vuulr, the first ICO launching under this platform is incredible.

I don't however hold Qash, though Quoinex is my primary fiat-crypto exchange.

I am investing because: 
- 
* It has been vetted by the Quoine team and approved as the first ICO on their platform, who have one of the most secure exchanges (in my opinion) 

* The token economy/mechanics are incredibly thought out and address the token velocity problem in crypto. There's also staking from the beginning
* Superstar team: have been to their office and met quite a lot of the team, this is a real business with top talent behind it and they're hiring more people
* There is a strong investor hook and consumer hook (for us marketing geeks this is awesome)
* The product and business has strong traction with quality partnerships to be announced soon. They're simplifying a $240 billion industry and saving media buyers and sellers huge amounts of money
* Guaranteed listing on Qryptos; so many ICOs fail to get listed on any larger exchanges which is why I hardly have made any ICO investments in the past
* Hard cap is tiny for a project of this size

"How about a place of BTC in our lives? You can find lots of interesting facts below. When everybody is trying to buy Bitcoins we are trying to understand whether Bitcoins can play a big role in our life? We mean, how can we use them in real life and why we buy them.
As Bitcoin has no central bank its supply is decentralized. Simply put, It is not like dollars, pounds or even gold, you can’t touch them. Then why do we eagerly want to buy them and how can we spend them?
First of all, this kind of digital currency transaction are private and secure. It is ensured by the fact that no third party can take part in the transaction. This can provide cryptocurrency with a bright future.
You may say “How can I spend bitcoins?”. Don’t worry, bitcoin can already be accepted in numerous shops, websites and companies all over the world.
The number of companies accepting bitcoin payments has increased over the last few years. For example, Microsoft and travel website Expedia both accept bitcoin as a means of payment. 
Cryptocurrency has also found favor in Zimbabwe and Venezuela. One interesting fact, Icelandic singer Bjork is also accepting bitcoin payments for her latest album. 
You see, crypto has made huge steps all over the world. Jack Lawson from New York bought a modern bed for his new flat on Overstock with Bitcoins. Another crypto holder, Tracey Blomfield from the UK, chose the Xbox 360 on Newegg and payed BTC for it. Sounds fascinating, doesn’t it? 
So, you can see that consumers may pay with their BTC on many popular websites. Besides that, Bitcoins can be accepted when paying for an education. Paul Birch pays BTC for his education at the University of Cyprus each year and Donna Atwood also uses BTC for similar payments at King’s College in North Carolina.
One more amazing fact, in parts of Asia, Bitcoin is already being accepted as payment for utilities. Wanzi Lee from China pays for her gas, water, and electric bills using Bitcoins, without having to convert into yuan. Japan is also keeping up with the times. Their consumers can buy electronics with BTC at the largest electronics stores in the country. This is the way Akira Tanaka from Tokyo bought her second TV in a big local electronics store.
After all the controversial questions and strong doubts brought about by cryptocurrency it is quickly being included in our life and will help us to live faster and more comfortable lives.

"Oh so you're saying, as the major gateways to alts (due to pairings), BTC and ETH going up directly raise the value of other coins that they're paired with. And therefore you're saying, what's the point of passing through BTC to another alt, that ends up doing worse than BTC anyway, you could have just done better staying in BTC.

If that's what you mean, I see your point, but I think that this effect is going to dissipate from here on out as more and more fiat and other major pairings come online which is only inevitable. In a couple of years I really don't see there being any major reliance on sat values like there is now.

"I hope you can help me bring this to the attention of the UK parliament. No other outlet has covered this, and Martin Walker \(identified in the regulatory hearing only as  the Director of the Centre of Evidence Based Management\) is getting away with bashing blockchain as a financial instrument as well as Bitcoin, Ripple, and decentralized systems without revealing his massive vested interest in doing that.

# Conflict of Interest

Walker never mentioned that R3 came under major criticism for building **a decentralized ledger for finance that they insist now is ""not a blockchain""**, or that R3 are suing Ripple for not letting them buy 5&amp;#37; of the total supply of XRP, **even though he repeatedly insisted that XRP was too manipulated and volatile to be useful**. He said the only good thing about Bitcoin was that it created a blockchain that could be gutted and stripped of all privacy and decentralized featur**es, meaning R3's Corda ledger without actually saying t**hat.

I wrote this article after a Twitter user discovered this guy was with R3. This man, Martin Walker, had the full attention of the UK treasury committee in charge of regulation for an hour, and they don't know who he really was.

did you actually search on this or just in general of what you see in this subreddit? 

because whenever Bitcoin Cash makes any strides and increase in value you'd see those bashing ""promoters"" or people within the Bitcoin Cash community. never the technology itself. 

just a note: Roger Ver was one of the first promoters of Bitcoin (BTC) and kept being a promoter and he's a libertarian (disregarded his US passport and lives in Japan). he promoted BTC well before some of those schmucks running BTC down even started investing into it. most of the debates he had were well put and makes sense. 

the whole ""bitcoin cash is bitcoin"" started after a long-fought battle with Blockstream proponents (that saw Mike Hearn and Gavin Andersen leave the development of Bitcoin) on several fronts, one of which is block size. He started supporting bitcoin cash and stood by his comment that in case Segwit2x fails to go through he will support whatever fork that supports it, which was Bitcoin Cash at the time.

It's not a profitable coin if the only reason it's up is because the underlying thing it's valued against - BTC/Eth - is rising and you bought it with than and not fiat. 

Just take a look at CMC and compare the %ages in USD and satoshi/gwei of any alt while looking at the %age change of BTC/Eth itself.

"Btc is king, btc falls everything falls. Its the way cryptocurrency works atm. This is normal. ",1525692644
"A word of advice, there are two versions of cryptocurrency that claim the ""bitcoin"" title. This post is going to get downvoted instantly, but here goes:

/r/btc promotes Bitcoin Cash, a fork of the original Bitcoin network. This is why, the majority of people will recommend you to buy BCH (Bitcoin Cash) instead of BTC, and will tell you that BTC is the ""broken"" coin.

/r/bitcoin promotes BTC and is against Bitcoin Cash, which they're viewing it as an alt coin (alternative coin, or bitcoin clone), and that BCH is trying to confuse newbies into buying BCH instead of BTC.

I would STRONGLY suggest you ignore 80% what both community say, because they're currently ""at war with one another"" and don't actually care about new users, they only care about throwing poo at each other. **THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU LOSING MONEY**

So if you're (rightfully) confused about what you should to, I'm just gonna say that you started on the right path. Andreas Antonopoulos is one of the best people you can listen to to learn what bitcoin is, what can be used for, and how it works. Beyond that, you should do your own research and decide what do you want to support. Both BTC and BCH have great potential, they're both solving scaling problems differently, but the communities here on reddit are awful, and they will try to get you on their side.

I would recommend you joining /r/bitcoinbeginners and /r/cryptocurrency for more general talk.

You should also visit https://bitcointalk.org. I'm sure that the BCH promoters around here can suggest BCH specific communities and links :)",1525692640
"&gt;Nobody is going to leave their country because of a cryptocurrency ban.

"&gt;&amp;gt; On the original client it would.

&gt;So you’re now cherry picking what original client is just to fit your narrative? Up to 2015 there was no debate what is the original client functionality and what is bitcoin. But now you suddenly decide to reject it because politics. This is plain hypocrisy.

You said the 1MB was a consensus rules for 9 years?

If true the original client would reject 2MB and it doesn’t.

1MB was implemented later.


&gt;&amp;gt; No it is because after segwit old node can see all the data.

&gt;&amp;gt; If old nodes could see it, it would reject block (because blocks would go beyond 1MB).

&gt;You’re just wrong. Butcoin blocks are 1mb no matter if they include segwit data or not. Segwit transactions are bitcoin transaction and they pay bitcoin fees for every byte just like all others. Consensus rules are not changed and the proof to that is that old nodes can accept and validate new blocks.

Old node cant validate segwit transactions.

They have no access to the signature data.

They have to “trust” segwit transactions are valid: SPV security.

&gt;What you’re doing is mental gymnastics and being a hypocrite. FWIW memo cash is the same kind of change as segwit - it attaches meaning to bitcoin transaction that wasn’t there beforehand. 

No, all have access to memo cash data and can verification the memo tx validity.

&gt;And what if somebody shares a torrent url in memo message? 

Well that would be cool, I see no problem with that.

&gt;Does it mean the block that included such message is now size of that torrent blob?

No, obviously. 

But the torrent content is not needed to verify the tx, signature data is.",1525692078
"That doesn't make any sense. If I'm investing fiat and want greater returns in fiat then it doesn't matter whether I'd have less ETH.

Besides the fact we want things to ""just work"" the way you expect them to, we believe UI/UX play a huge role. For example, no one nailed a good markets view yet, with all cryptocurrencies, smart indicators and top notch filter/sorting controls. Yet our markets tab offers you more options than CoinMarketCap, on mobile. If you want to sort the ""top 100 to 300 market cap cryptos"" by variation, you can in Spot. Regarding portfolio tracking, we are making smart things to optimize your holdings and I can give you a simple example. In existing apps, you have to select the pair to use to estimate your holdings for each of your crypto. In Spot we will automatically select the best pair for each holding \- find the pair with the highest price AND with enough volume for you to execute the trade \(we won't chose the same pair if you own 1 BTC or 100 BTC and you can also exclude some exchanges\).

I hate some of the BCH community. The problem is, you can't ""decentralise"" the influence people have. I cannot do anything but spread a positive message : I believe in a cause, and I believe others should at least look into it. I hope that the majority of BCH supporters, who are much more sane and simply oppose what happened to Bitcoin and the community, help build BCH a better image. Because since the smear campaign against XT (what it was called when Gavin, the lead developer who got passed the project from Satoshi, proposed it after a good community response) and the censoring, the people most angry have only hurt its image. 

Proof that the community is mostly sane is that I asked questions on r/btc and they gave me tons of sources and info. And the top post there a couple days ago was ""Am I the only one who thinks we should just be Bitcoin Cash and not Bitcoin"". Because although its technically fair to say that ""BCH is at least as much Bitcoin as BTC is"" in terms of the tech, there's other factors to consider.

Tiny insight to history:
The community wanted bigger blocks, Blockstream wanted 2nd layer solutions. Unfortunately, Blockstream had all the power and influence, so the community followed XT, but got attacked, banned, miners got DDOSd etc (all verifiable if you want proofs), and it slowly faded away, creating BCH. It's only grown since, as more and more people become aware of the history of the situation. 

I very recently also hated BCH because of Ver etc, but someone just told me to look into it, and I did, now I'm not ANTI-BCH, I'm anti-censoring and lies. Which Ver tries to do. And Blockstream did in a much more horrible way. ",1525690426

You’re just wrong. Butcoin blocks are 1mb no matter if they include segwit data or not. Segwit transactions are bitcoin transaction and they pay bitcoin fees for every byte just like all others. Consensus rules are not changed and the proof to that is that old nodes can accept and validate new blocks.

What you’re doing is mental gymnastics and being a hypocrite. FWIW memo cash is the same kind of change as segwit - it attaches meaning to bitcoin transaction that wasn’t there beforehand.

"This is flawed logic. You have $10kUSD to spend. You have 1500 coins to choose from. You have to make a bet on which one you think will perform the best. 

Your ultimate goal is to pick the coin that has the greatest increase in value compared to what you are giving up, and plan to convert back into (fiat). If you fail to pick the number 1 winner, well you hope to still make some profit. If you choose coin X over coin Y, it's because you have some reason for believing it will do better. BTC is just one of these coins, maybe it's coin X, maybe it's coin Y, maybe it's coin Z. There is no reason to ""default"" to it unless you believe it is the strongest coin with the best future out there. 

To rephrase your question to illustrate my point:

&gt; What you're saying is you'd be OK with putting 2475 ICX ($10K) into OMG and coming out with 1958 ICX provided the ""real money"" value (read: underlying ICX value) was greater than $10K which is silly because you lost 517 ICX worth of ""real money"" value and you'd have even more ""real money"" if you had just left it in ICX.

Your view is simply a BTC-centric view, focusing on BTC as a ""standard"", when really, despite being the grandaddy of crypto, there's no economical reason to default to BTC besides using it as a trading pair and a means to move funds between exchanges. Pick the coin you believe in, and if it does the best out of all coins like you hope, congrats! If it doesn't, well learn from your mistake, figure out why coins D, T, and Z did better than your coin, but at least you still made real profit despite not making as much profit as you could have.",1525689014

No it is because after segwit old node can see all the data.

Some ETH, barely any BTC. I'm mostly in alts, which is why I don't care to compare the prices of my alts to the value of BTC.

&gt; the only reason it appears like you're in profit is because BTC had gone up so much in value i.e. you'd have even more ""real money"" if you had just left it in BTC which you should do if you really don't care about satoshi price.

I love crypto but it is a highly speculative and a textbook example of a bubble.
2) Speculation is not binary. Yes, you base your valuation of stocks / bonds / der. on future expectations; thus, you do speculate to an extent. But you do so by using tried and tested methods, which have consistently yielded results.  There is no speculation as in crypto. Here you have a new company with mostly fresh management which has gathered millions due to the strength of crowd financing and which has promised X, Y and Z. They are not bound by anything to deliver. Moreover, you cannot evne be assured of the product because they (on average) have no product whatsoever. Some hadn;t even released testnets...

3) There is no ""better investment"". Using such terminology shows you are incompetent when it comes to portfolio management / investing. Everyone invests with respect to their risk profile.

"&gt; BCash is not Bitcoin

BCash is not Bitcoin Cash either. Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin is Bitcoin. I've never argued any other way. Sure Roger does, and I most certainly disagree with him on that. However, I do agree that Bitcoin is trustless, non-proprietary, and anyone has a claim to the name. I disagree that the incumbent version of Bitcoin is the Bitcoin I signed up for, but the market has accepted Bitcoin as Bitcoin, so so do I. 

The fact is though, that trolls like you who run around calling Bitcoin Cash ""BCash"" are the ones who caused the ""Bitcoin Core"" retaliation; most of us were more than happy to get on with it as Bitcoin Cash. Trolls like you forced Rogers hand, and you're all now super butthurt about it. Get over it and stop being **childish hypocrites**. The day no troll slurs ""BCash"" as ad-hominem, is the day that I'll agree that Roger should change ""Bitcoin Core"" back to Bitcoin; until then: hypocrites begone!

I also disagree with your opinion that ""the skillful developers"" remained on the incumbent chain. There are plenty of skillful developers on both chains, but trolls refuse to recognise that lest they suffer from cognitive dissonance. But hey, you have a right to your opinion, even if it's set in stone through your own biases. 

I think we got to the bottom of your real issue here. It's not with Jamie, it's your vendetta against Bitcoin Cash and Roger Ver. You don't give a shit about ""journalistic integrity""...if you did you'd be on Fox News subreddits and The_Donald calling it out- the fact that you're not shows why you're here: to sow discord on this sub by starting quarrels or upsetting people...you know, the actual meaning of Internet troll which is exactly what I called you.

&gt; The only reason it retained and gained value afterwards was because it was an 'air-dropped' dividend for BTC holders that was distributed through wallets and exchanges at different times.

Blatantly false. There was no airdrop and you know it. The network forked in two directions: Bitcoin Cash, and Bitcoin with Segwit. The network no longer exists as it did, and the incumbents retained the name. 

&gt; It's weaker than several other projects 

It's much much stronger than Bitcoin, and is aiming for that number 1 spot. If it was as weak as you say you'd be happy to ignore it. 

&gt; and cannot compete with Bitcoin in terms of roadmap or consensus.

""Consensus"" - ha ha ha! Everyone outside of your little echo chamber is still calling on Bitcoin to increase the blocksize. Listen to industry experts from sources outside of Blockstream control. Read the blogs of the CEO's of major Bitcoin businesses. Listen to podcasts like those on the LTB network. Watch how people like Antonopolous tiptoe around the issue. Listen to Vitalik. If you really think you have consensus now that Bitcoin Cash is here, you're delusional!

"Theory and practice are different things. I say it again, if the tokens have no valuation, then the costs to perform large quantities of things that are not ""peer to peer electronic cash"" would be pretty much only the cost of hardware, which in itself is for most people also pretty much nothing at all.

Lets go over this:

&gt; The limit was originally Hal Finney's idea.  Both Satoshi and I objected that it wouldn't scale at 1MB.  Hal was concerned about a potential DoS attack though, and after discussion, Satoshi agreed.  The 1MB limit was there by the time Bitcoin launched.

It took all the way to may, 2010 before the first known valuation got public:

&gt; I'll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas.. like maybe 2 large ones

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.0

And then the valuation was something alongthe lines of $25 / 10000 = $0,0025/BTC.

For the entirety of at least a full year, the valuation of the tokens were insignificant and for an attacker represented a cost of **ZERO, NADA, NILCH, NULL, NONE**. We know this, it ain't controversy, and the 1mb limit was sensible at the time.

&gt; Several attempted ""abuses"" of the blockchain under the 1MB limit have proved Hal right about needing the limit at least for launching purposes. A lot of people wanted to piggyback extraneous information onto the blockchain, and before miners (and the community generally) realized that blockchain space was a valuable resource they would have allowed it.",1525686827

"Well I'm not going to respond to each and every point above but..

1. Do you have numbers to cite in terms of adoption? Both in terms of BCH as well as BTC and the merchants that BTC is losing. 

2. Regardless of what those numbers are you're grossly overestimating the demand there is for such use case at present time. People are not dying to use another form of payment to buy coffee, video games or any other consumer good. This is not a compelling use case.

3. The real compelling use case is sound money, which BCH, imo, is not characteristic of. Weaker in every sense compared to BTC in regards to security, scalability, centralization, tech, etc. It's unclear why Bitcoin Cash even has value, given that it doesn't have a long term plan to compete and it's network effect is deviating further from BTC, so why exactly does it have intrinsic value?

4. LN is here today. Proof of concept is already well established. Waiting a few more months to a year or two is not a big deal. Again, as mentioned in (2), the demand for merchant adoption is simply not there right now. Scaling to 8 Mb or 32 Mb or 1 Gb or whatever block size doesn't solve for fundamental concerns, issues and properties that Bitcoin **must** retain in order to position itself as sound money.

5. Nobody (almost nobody) ever said that Bitcoin was digital gold. People say (or they mean to say) that Bitcoin has the chance to become digital gold. But really, much more than that. It can (will?) become sound money but its network is far too small at the moment and liquidity is still a nightmare. These things take time. As you mentioned, gold and previous metals took years to establish themselves in their respective roles. You can't expect this to happen over night.

BCH simply doesn't stand up to BTC or even LTC, XMR, ETH or XRP. It's weaker than all these other offerings, so why? Is it just because of the name ""Bitcoin"" or because of the shared chain prior to Aug 1? Why does it have any intrinsic value?",1525686085
"&gt; Your definition of spam is arbitrary. It is ""use cases I don't like.""

No, I did not state this. I gave examples of things that I define as spam, and said that it is the actual content that matters, not the quantity of that content.

&gt; ""Peer to Peer Electronic Cash""

This is what non-spam is. Everything else is spam; but determining what cash is is not easy and everything that is making cash work even if it is not cash itself may well belong and be non-spam.

For example, if we deem the actual ledger entries (UTXO) to be the tokens, and represent the cash, then the act of signing a transaction is not cash, it is movement of cash. Such movement isn't cash itself, but it still belongs on the blockchain. Since the bitcoin blockchain runs on a scripting system, it is technically difficult to determine if a given script functions as a method to transact value.

In the end, I didn't make a strict definition because I don't think a strict definition works here, resorting instead to examples of things that was actually discussed and to some degree tried back before the blocksize limit was implemented and that we could've seen a lot more of if the decision to limit capacity wasn't taken in time.",1525685885

"&gt; What are you fucking talking about? It doesn't just get this feature, these characteristics are earned through markets and liquidity pools. 

how well it proves to work is a question but as a currency it has inherent in it a store of value feature.

and lol @ talking about earned characteristics, given how many BTC people claim it is store of value digital gold - whereas gold has a very special seat in the financial system earned by culture and thousands of years of human history and banking.

&gt; It has worse security, more centralization, lower difficulty, worse liquidity, worse volume, etc.

both are fledgling crypto currencies and the trading volume today is not what matters, the adoption rate for merchant and peer transactions is what matters.  which one do you honestly think would be easier today to convince a merchant to accept?  the one big push you actually could have for BTC is more people with it - but you need people who will buy coffee with it, not people who will HODL it and say it's not for buying things with.

&gt; The one thing is maybe has is cheaper fees at the moment (not really though, not compared to LN).

you are completely ignoring the complexity of the LN.  i'm a computer nerd and i don't even want to learn or deal with that stuff.  that BCH is simpler and cheaper **at the moment** is a huge deal.  so it is at the next moment and moment after that.  you do realize that many moments later BCH can have the greater adoption right?  it won't matter if BTC has some areas of technical superiority because technical superiority fails to capture adoption *all the time.*  and again, i believe BCH can incorporate it as well.

&gt; Except they can't. Not without implementing Segwit or some other workaround.

if big blocks at some point cannot truly keep up with transactions, and fees come to the point of harming adoption, i expect BCH to implement what would be required to handle additional volume to scale.  perhaps i am wrong, but it certainly seems more sensible to have that debate near the time where it is an actual problem, vs. insisting on 1 MB blocks and harming adoption immediately.  which i don't believe is something anyone can dispute wasn't done, BTC clearly ran into adoption problems and lost merchants instead of gaining them.

&gt; Lol, BCT? You mean BTC? You're completely wrong. The innovation happens on BTC. Segwit, LN, Schnorr, etc. That's real innovation. Enabling OP codes and bumping up the blocksize is just tinkering that anyone can do.

yes, typo.  i wasn't talking about innovation, i was talking about adoption by merchants and peer to peer payments.  i consider it the most important thing for a new voluntary currency to achieve.  why would you not?  which do you think matters more to my mom, technical superiority or it is simple and easy to use?

&gt; BCH runs a massive amount of Blockstream code, FFS. All the development happens on BTC and ETH. Everything else is substandard and BCH in particular is mostly just a ripoff of ""core"" and ""blockstream"".

so, BCH gets free code?  i am trying to have a currency economics discussion and you are bringing up who is best at computer science.  my mom doesn't care about the latter.

&gt; Again, this is so fucking wrong. BTC is interested in real adoption, not just creating a massive blockchain for no apparent reason. Bitcoin scales through innovative design, like Segwit or Schnorr, plus abstracted layers, of which LN is only one example. This is exactly how the internet works. TCP/IP is like Bitcoin and HTTP or FTP is like LN.

my observation was that BTC has more speculators, who i do not consider adopters, and i fully stand by it.  based on what i have seen in reddit as well as conversations i have had online and face to face with people in the US, thailand, and bali.  if BTC is like TCP/IP, i would point out TCP/IP draft version was working ok for years, and the 1 MB limit harmed adoption when the draft could have been 2 MB.  now there's two competing verions of TCP/IP and we'll see which one outcompetes.  since i perceive the entire point to be a fully reserved banking currency system, i will jump on the side which i think is most concerned at currency adoption for transactions, what actually gives a currency its value.  i perceive BTC to have harmed that and BCH to have forked and have a community more interested in that.

i have definitely met people who share that view as the goal with BTC - but as noted i think there are more speculators over there.  and although those BTC supporters agree that is the goal, they also say not now - we have to get security and LN to some point first.  it's like hold on everybody don't use TCP/IP yet, we've got to perfect it first.  whereas the BCH version is saying hey everybody, use this now.

you yourself admit just above that BCH has cheaper fees for now.  if LN was simple and fast tomorrow, i would agree with you, it's the way to go.  i'd expect BCH to tank.  however i do not believe this is going to happen tomorrow, and at the moment i think it's going to be so many tomorrows that BCH will gain relevance and popularity while BTC loses it.  but we'll have to wait and see how that pans out.

&gt; You're talking about something that is still in early stage beta and has only 1900 nodes at the moment.

if this is your stance then you should not be advocating it as a fee parity alternate solution to present BCH.  that is my entire point above - it's not ready - and i speculate it will not be ready for some time, and BCH will start eating BTC's lunch while BTC is pegged to LN's readiness and success.

&gt; Lol, okay buddy. You actually don't have a clue but according to you, you are a super expert on all things Bitcoin.

i don't claim that at all.  the response you highlighting was me saying the biggest sin is harming adoption.  this was not even a statement about bitcoin, it was a statement about currencies.  most currencies are state issued and by force of government have immediate adoption.  BTC or BCH have an uphill voluntaryist climb for people to opt-in to it.  and a currency becomes stable and gets its value ultimately through organic supply and demand for transactions.  this has nothing to do with bitcoin, it's currency economics 101.  what part do you disagree with?

&gt; Wrong and wrong. Do you have sources for any of this nonsense?

i can't link you to anything specific, however i don't think i'm wrong at all expressing it is a common belief that BTC is on-chain 'store of value only' with LN to provide 'medium of exchange at some point' - this is something that appears to be a common belief in both r/btc and r/bitcoin as well as among some of the BTC proponents i have met in real life.  i do not know what your own view is but i don't believe the one i've articulated is uncommon.

&gt; Are you nuts? You realize that Segwit alone is processing more transactions than BCH, right? You understand that? Beyond that LN is up and running and will soon reach more widespread adoption when mainstream wallets start hitting app stores. 

BTC certainly has more transactions, but as i've noted i am looking at adoption as the important metric.  i know plenty of people who have bought BTC to HODL, caring now about fractional or fully reserved banking, or it being used as a currency at all, but simply in the hopes they will get rich, win the crypto lottery, etc.  but that is nothing other than a speculative gamble, and if everyone did that, BTC would simply be like a speculative ponzi scheme.  you seem to be asserting that if my friend who owns a nail salon bought BTC and a guy i know on a car forum bought BTC that it's going to be the currency that wins.  whereas my stance is whichever one my friend with the nail salon would *accept as payment* is the one that will win.  and i believe it would be a lot easier to convince her to accept BCH today than BTC.  you've acknowledged above that LN is in beta and fees are higher on BTC, my friend doesn't care about us arguging about computer science, segwit, centralization, or schnorr signatures - which one TODAY would be easier for you or i to convince her to accept?

&gt; This is maybe a year away at most.

it will be interesting to see how the year develops, no doubt.

&gt; Yeah, again. You're wrong about that. TXs and value of TXs are greater on Bitcoin. Bitcoin is accepted in lots of places and is the more liquid crypto asset, with the most trading pairs on markets.

by nature of being a first mover it certainly is, acting similar to a petrodollar.  there's no reason for us to need an intermediary or for it to continue to be the only one though.  i don't know why you would extrapolate out this current state well into the future.  as far as acceptance you appear to be ignoring the fact that many places stopped accepting it.

&gt; Your facts are just blatantly wrong but whatever. Keep on living the delusion.

"**Hodl**

Hodl ( HOD-əl; often written HODL) is a slang term and Internet meme that is used in the Bitcoin community when referring to holding the cryptocurrency rather than selling it. It originated in a December 2013 post on the Bitcoin Forum message board by an apparently inebriated user who posted with a typo in the subject, ""I AM HODLING."" In 2017, Quartz listed it as one of the essential slang terms in Bitcoin culture, and described it as a stance, ""to stay invested in bitcoin and not to capitulate in the face of plunging prices."" TheStreet.com referred to it as the ""favorite mantra"" of Bitcoin holders.

Since entering the Bitcoin vernacular and that of other cryptocurrencies, HODL has become a backronym for ""hold on for dear life"".

"I am usually not bullish on platforms like this that say they will decentralize everything. Decentralize how? They never seem to have the answer. For most of these platforms like Google, apple, Spotify, their main appeal is the network effects. The fact that a small producer can come and without any previous network, get his/her work before millions of people. The producers willingly give up the 30%-50% because they know they can't get that exposure elsewhere.
Also, places like Google and Apple app stores provides so much value adds like Hosting, updates et al. 

For a crypto platform to succeed in disrupting the Creative Industry, it has to work hard to get those Critical mass of users first. Then provide value adds. Then producers will flock to it en masse. A good example is Steemit which today, even Bigtime YouTubers have flocked to and a bad example is CREA, which more than a year later , haven't lived up to its promise.

"&gt; And it's an opinion that's shared with a lot of others.

Except not the market. The bottom line regarding Roger is that he's lying and manipulating. He's calling Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin and admits to doing so openly. This would be illegal in a regulated market or industry and for good reason but Roger doesn't care. The fact that he feels he can get away with purposefully misleading people just shows that his character is severely lacking. BCash **is not** Bitcoin in any way shape or form other than the fact that they share chain histories prior to Aug 1. That's the only similarity. Bitcoin retained the network, the market, the majority of developers (and the skillful ones) and everything else of importance. Bitcoin refers not only to the software implementation, but also the network, consensus rules and chain itself. Roger is an asshole for making people believe that Bitcoin is ""Bitcoin Core,"" as if that made any sense and BCash is ""Bitcoin (Cash)"" or just ""Bitcoin"". It's just a blatant falsehood and he defends it by citing the subtext of the white paper, which is just an absurd argument. 

If BCH has captured the network on or around Aug 1, then it would be Bitcoin, but it didn't, so it's not. End of story. Roger and all the people paroting this nonsense need to get a clue and start promoting BCH under its own name. The consensus was that BCH was a contentious hard fork and was rejected by the network. The only reason it retained and gained value afterwards was because it was an 'air-dropped' dividend for BTC holders that was distributed through wallets and exchanges at different times. Turns out if you give a network of people something new to trade, they'll trade it. In the end though, BCH has no intrinsic value. It's weaker than several other projects and cannot compete with Bitcoin in terms of roadmap or consensus. It's, quite frankly, redundant and inferior in every way. Good luck if you think otherwise, really.

"&gt; it was already implied in beijingbitcoin's post that as a 'p2p sound currency' that BCH would have this feature. so what exactly are you jumping on him about?

What are you fucking talking about? It doesn't just *get* this feature, these characteristics are earned through markets and liquidity pools. You are talking about how great BCH is but its characteristics are secondary to *at least* BTC or other alts and systems. It has worse security, more centralization, lower difficulty, worse liquidity, worse volume, etc. The one thing is *maybe* has is cheaper fees **at the moment** (not really though, not compared to LN). Even so, it pales in comparison to Venmo, XRP, etc. If your merely talking about fees, BCH loses by a long shot and will never compete with hierarchical systems.

&gt;i expect that they will adopt LN if they need to. 

Except they can't. Not without implementing Segwit or some other workaround. 

&gt;BCT has harmed adoption and BCH has trudged forward with it.

Lol, BCT? You mean BTC? You're completely wrong. The innovation happens on BTC. Segwit, LN, Schnorr, etc. That's real innovation. Enabling OP codes and bumping up the blocksize is just tinkering that anyone can do. BCH runs a massive amount of Blockstream code, FFS. All the development happens on BTC and ETH. Everything else is substandard and BCH in particular is mostly just a ripoff of ""core"" and ""blockstream"". 

&gt;i also find the BCH community seems more interested in adoption, whatever the price may end up being, while BTC has more people who are just speculators hoping to HODL to the moon. one of these communities makes far more sense to me for trying to get voluntary new currency adoption, and right now.

Again, this is so fucking wrong. BTC is interested in *real* adoption, not just creating a massive blockchain for no apparent reason. Bitcoin scales through innovative design, like Segwit or Schnorr, plus abstracted layers, of which LN is only one example. This is exactly how the internet works. TCP/IP is like Bitcoin and HTTP or FTP is like LN. 

&gt;i'm actually not - but i think you're failing to acknowledge it's routing problems at scale are non-trivial and it's current problems for basic use are complex. unless you think this is no big deal, particularly for a new user?

You're talking about something that is still in early stage beta and has only 1900 nodes at the moment. Clearly you don't understand how networks develop. Go back to '09/'10 and read about people using Bitcoin *then*. It was a different and much smaller world. No ""real world use cases."" LN, like Bitcoin, needs time to build and spread. It's already up and running though, so I'm not sure what you're complaining about. Before, the line was ""LN is never coming."" But now it's out, so BCashers have changed their complaint once again. Moving the goalposts much?

&gt;the biggest sin to me is harming adoption, which BTC has done without dispute.

Lol, okay buddy. You actually don't have a clue but according to you, you are a super expert on all things Bitcoin. 

&gt;their success is currently tied to LN which is both complex and not ready to scale in a huge way.

Wrong and wrong. Do you have sources for any of this nonsense?

&gt;either one of these technologies could win. but each month that goes by where BCH focuses on and achieves adoption while LN's promises go unfulfilled and the same isn't happening is another step closer for BCH to win.

Are you nuts? You realize that Segwit alone is processing more transactions than BCH, right? You understand that? Beyond that LN is up and running and will soon reach more widespread adoption when mainstream wallets start hitting app stores. This is maybe a year away at most. 


&gt;and by adoption i don't mean speculator buy and HODL, i mean a merchant or peer to peer transaction taking place for a good or service.

Yeah, again. You're wrong about that. TXs and value of TXs are greater on Bitcoin. Bitcoin is accepted in lots of places and is the more liquid crypto asset, with the most trading pairs on markets. 

Your facts are just blatantly wrong but whatever. Keep on living the delusion.

That would a good argument, if Crypto was a bubble. 


The reason why Crypto has always grown, is because use was there, right now. That's no longer the case. It's all speculative shitcoins and one coin, that accounts for 35% of the entire market is supposed to determine, whether 100% of the market moves up or down. 


Because Altcoins have no legs. 65% has no legs. If Bitcoin dips, Altcoins dip 2/3x. That's a fact. 


That market dynamic simply no longer plays out. 35% cannot possibly carry 65% of the weight. It just doesn't work. Shitcoins are overvalued, and thus all of Crypto must correct downwards in the coming week.",1525681819

"**Shill**

A shill, also called a plant or a stooge, is a person who publicly helps or gives credibility to a person or organization without disclosing that they have a close relationship with the person or organization. Shills can carry out their operations in the areas of media, journalism, marketing, confidence games, or other business areas. A shill may also act to discredit opponents or critics of the person or organization in which they have a vested interest through character assassination or other means.

In most uses, shill refers to someone who purposely gives onlookers, participants or ""marks"" the impression of an enthusiastic customer independent of the seller, marketer or con artist, for whom they are secretly working.

"&gt; What? What does this statement even mean?

it means a currency is a store of value, medium of exchange, and unit of account.  it was already implied in beijingbitcoin's post that as a 'p2p sound currency' that BCH would have this feature.  so what exactly are you jumping on him about?

&gt; Mis-informed rhetoric, nothing more. ""Core"" does not control Bitcoin, despite what Roger claims. Also, you're mischaracterizing their views. 

i've absolutely seen multiple people with this view in r/bitcoin and i haven't participated in either subreddit for very long.  i'm not mischaracterizing a lot of people's views - who i think in general understand neither currencies nor gold.  i have no idea what your view is vs. the next guy's.  the only conversation i've had that is constructive is in real life with a BTC guy whose position is BTC needs to used as money, it's just we've got to have everything all tidied up before then and we are relying on LN to do it, and BCH won't scale.  and i'll say maybe - but if BCH needs off chain to scale when it comes to that, i expect that they will adopt LN if they need to.  in the mean time, BCT has harmed adoption and BCH has trudged forward with it.

i also find the BCH community seems more interested in adoption, whatever the price may end up being, while BTC has more people who are just speculators hoping to HODL to the moon.  one of these communities makes far more sense to me for trying to get voluntary new currency adoption, and right now.

&gt; ALSO, you're failing to acknowledge that LN is FAR cheaper and FAR faster and FAR more scalable than BCH will ever be.

i'm actually not - but i think you're failing to acknowledge it's routing problems at scale are non-trivial and it's current problems for basic use are complex.  unless you think this is no big deal, particularly for a new user?  https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8hgdm4/on_eclair_lightning_wallet_how_do_i_add_btc_to_an/

i have no ideological dedication to either technology - but the BCH community has a more sound idea of the goal to me.  i also don't think it will be that difficult to adopt LN at some time if desired.  the biggest sin to me is harming adoption, which BTC has done without dispute.  their success is currently tied to LN which is both complex and not ready to scale in a huge way.

either one of these technologies could win.  but each month that goes by where BCH focuses on and achieves adoption while LN's promises go unfulfilled and the same isn't happening is another step closer for BCH to win.  and by adoption i don't mean speculator buy and HODL, i mean a merchant or peer to peer transaction taking place for a good or service.",1525679968

"&gt; Doesn't this mean (assuming roughly the same proportion of bandwidth &amp; RAM per miner) that if the number of miners increases in the same proportion to the number of users that the system will scale effectively?

No, that sounds like a non sequitur to me. Why would you assume this to be the case?

If any given (non-mining) user is completely incapable of self-validation, the defining ""peer-to-peer"" property of Bitcoin effectively disappears, which arguably renders the entire system moot.

&gt;So when we had lots of new people getting involved at the end of 2017 and the network slowed down

I am not sure what you're referring to here. The network didn't really meaningfully ""slow down"" towards the end of 2017 (and by no means would an influx of users cause it to do so).

&gt;isn't this just because there were not enough miners?

No, not really. The average time between blocks has pretty much always been just under ten minutes; [see this chart](https://data.bitcoinity.org/bitcoin/block_time/5y?f=m10&amp;t=l) for a clearer picture of this. Note that [the interval actually slightly *decreased* in late 2017](https://data.bitcoinity.org/bitcoin/block_time/2y?f=m10&amp;t=l), contrary to the impression that you currently seem to have.

&gt;And with the increased load causing an increase in TX fees, doesn't this increase the incentive for more miners (even if there may be a significant lag before the number of miners catches up)?

An increase in total transaction fees does (marginally) contribute to the ""incentive to mine"" which should rationally lead to more miners coming online... but this effect is likely still somewhat dwarfed by other phenomena (e.g. the macroscopic price discovery Bitcoin is still undergoing, and the still-relatively-large and steadily-dependable block subsidy).

&gt;Or is the issue that if more miners keep mining when the network is no longer busy that the difficulty increases accordingly which is not good for anyone...?

I'm not sure what ""issue"" you're referring to in this context. Miners continuing to mine is not a problem (in fact, it's a good thing; the blockchain is built by mining). Difficulty increasing is not a problem (in fact, it's a good thing; the higher the difficulty, the more proof-of-work is securing the chain). Transaction fees rising is not a problem (in fact, it's a good thing; the system requires fees to sustain incentives as we evolve and transition from an inflation-based model, and fees only rise if the aggregate demand for transaction confirmation dramatically exceeds available supply [i.e. block space], which means that Bitcoin is succeeding in delivering real value to the world, by definition).

&gt;I guess what I’m seeing is the potential for a kind of equilibrium being reached where it’s only economical for a certain proportion of miners to mine when the TX fees are high (part-time miners, as it were). This way difficulty does not increase unnecessarily when network usage is low (the part-time miners are not mining), but also that fees do not increase excessively when network usage is high (the part-time miners are mining). Does this make sense or am I still misunderstanding things?

I question the premises that ""difficulty rising is bad"" and ""fees increasing is bad""... the equilibrium state you describe could very well manifest, but I don't personally see these things as objectively desirable or ends unto themselves.

&gt;Further thought… Or is it more that my suggested increase in miners then results in each miner having to share data with more other miners so that the indirect effect of more users is ultimately a quadratic (or non-linear/exponential) increase in bandwidth/Ram usage?

The real problem, in my opinion, boils down to: ""Is Bitcoin continuing to function as a peer-to-peer cash system?"" If would-be peers on the network (i.e. savers/transactors/users) are unable to afford either **a) making transactions at all** or **b) validating their transactions (and by extension the entire chain)** then Bitcoin is failing to deliver the value it was designed and built to deliver. Some people obsess over **a** but forget about **b** entirely (which is silly, because without **b** there is no value in being able to do **a**, or rather, there is no *added* value to being able to do **a** *with Bitcoin*... and you can always achieve **a** with sensible, layered/stacked engineering *on top of* the bottom layer as long as **b** continues to remain meaningfully possible).

In short, if people can't afford to use Bitcoin in a trust-minimizing manner (which means ""run a fully-validating node"") then we have a system failure, and have lost the crucial ""decentralization"" property that made Bitcoin so special.",1525678651

The fact that Satoshi himself might hold 1/21 of the entire money supply gives me pause.  Satoshi must be the truest believer there is.  Either he can't spend his Bitcoin because he lost his keys, or he puts all other HODLers to shame.  I think Bitcoin fails Satoshi himself though because if any of the addresses associated to Satoshi moves, people could think he sold his coins and the value will plummet.  Of course, no one knows for *sure* **all** of Satoshi's addresses, but still -- Bitcoin will be truly fungible when Satoshi can spend his coins and we won't know that he's done it.  And that future's not impossible, especially with recent proposed improvements to Bitcoin.",1525677414

"It's easy, we have to just keep teaching people what really happened. Not attacking people for being subject to different information from us.

Let's fairly and kindly inform others about what happened, give them all the sources to prove it, and let them see for themselves what BTC and BCH stand for, so the BCH community will only grow. ",1525677203
"There seem to be a TON of people here who don't understand the basics of the market at all but walk around arguing and debating with people like they do.

Thin foil cap stuff like this is why I consider most crypto investors to be idiots.,1525677194
"Well, I would say, yes, that is a posibility, but hopefully we've learned from the past mistake where it was allowed to give access to repository to one entity only... and then being naive believing Core that they have good intentions and so on.

I agree with you, this thought crossed my mind also, but I said to myself, if this happens again, I will know straight away what to do but I think this won't happen again. Maybe they will find a new trick (you never know) so we'll see... it'll definitely just be more stress testing the Bitcoin itself... if it holds strong and it continues on, it'll just prove itself even more.

Beauty of Bitcoin is that when and if the code gets hijacked, we just fork again :-)",1525677085
"**Journalism ethics and standards**

Journalism ethics and standards comprise principles of ethics and of good practice as applicable to the specific challenges, this subset of media ethics is widely known to journalists as their professional ""code of ethics"" or the ""canons of journalism"". The basic codes and canons commonly appear in statements drafted by both professional journalism associations and individual print, broadcast, and online news organizations.

While various existing codes have some differences, most share common elements including the principles of truthfulness, accuracy, objectivity, impartiality, fairness, and public accountability, as these apply to the acquisition of newsworthy information and its subsequent dissemination to the public.

Like many broader ethical systems, journalism ethics include the principle of ""limitation of harm"".

"Another factor to consider is that the SEC are currently looking into any and all ICO-based tokens and whether they should be considered a security asset class.

If they are considered a security; this will have enormous repercussions on Ethereum, ERC20 token or ICO-based token. In the short term they’ll get wiped out as exchanges delist them. 

I’m not trying to spread FUD, the SEC are already doing that. I mention Ethereum because they already did [see here](https://cryptoslate.com/the-fate-of-ethereum-eth-pushes-toward-800-as-regulatory-announcement-looms/) 

Nano did not have an ICO. They literally gave away millions of coins for nothing. 

Nano is not another ERC20 token or bitcoin clone.

Nano already has fork projects: [taraxa.io](taraxa.io) and if you’ll allow me the pleasure [banano](banano.co.in)

"Agreed, where else can non-technical people go to earn crypto so easily in a fun and social environment.  Even if there are some issues, it's far better and less risky than most mining contracts.",1525676858
"The main point we've been trying to get across and it just gets on deff ears, is that we might not need to have every transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain, but we do not have nowhere near such issues now, or for many years to come... which is why preventing the blocks from getting any bigger is outright idiotic.

It would have been perfectly fine to allow Bitcoin blockchain to keep increasing blocks so to always allow new users and more transactions and provide great user experience and when and if new (REAL) solutions are found, we can use them in ADDITION to Bitcoin blockchain, but not crippling it.

Real libertarians want to allow people (ALL PEOPLE) to have a real choice... if the 2nd layer solutions are good, people will use them, but if they are not, they should have ability to use already proven and road-tested Bitcoin system.

Fact that Core/Blockstream are deliberately attacking the usability of it, is clear sign of deliberate attack, then adding to that knowledge that they are funded by bankers, and that their so called solution (Lighting) is actually not even working as decentralised system, it gets very obvious very quickly why they are doing this.

So for now... while Bitcoin (CASH) still works, and it works great we should and will continue to use it and scale on it. We should use what WORKS and Bitcoin (CASH) WORKS.",1525676856

"Lmao somebody doesn't have a clue what happened to Bitcoin. Gavin gets passed the project lead from Satoshi. Years pass, a scaling solution is needed. Bigger blocks solve everything, by simply changing a couple lines of code, removing the temporary limit originally opposed. Blockstream didn't want this, the community did. But guess who had all the power, the power to ban people in the reddit supporting XT and control the narrative, smear campaigns against opposing developers and exchanges, and DDOSs to nodes running the community preferred version. Too much power, they won.

It's very very sad that people seem to ignore all of this just because of what some Bitcoin Cash fans are doing NOW, instead of seeing the tons of provable shady crap done by the other side. ",1525676682
"This whole going to court thing was just a pablicity stunt to bring more attention to BTrash. They would never bring the subject to court because if a judge was to rule upon what version of bitcoin was most relevant to Satoshi's white paper. There is more of a chance it would be BCH, in efffect killing out the BTC chain by court of law. ",1525676550
"messaging part?

And honestly the simplest solution might be the best, not expecting a huge rush of ppl using bitcoin.  I might just set it up as a live chat sort of deal, confirm the transaction then send it.

trying to think a head though (and scaling) not sure how best this would work if two people happen to buy at the same time and we only get one transaction.",1525676522
