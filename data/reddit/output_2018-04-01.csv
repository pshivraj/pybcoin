"I can‚Äôt speak to some all-powerful Illuminati trying to destroy Bitcoin. But there was a good article (I‚Äôll try to find it or if someone knows what I‚Äôm talking about and can post a link) there is/are large sellers that are systematically overloading the market with supply everytime we run up THEN waiting for a little stabilization and then dumping supply back onto the market at a LOWER PRICE than the previous dumping. Then it‚Äôs rinse and repeat. This is not the action of a rational investor concerned about maximizing their investment return, this is a group of individuals whose sole purpose (IMO) is to overwhelm the market with supply and move the price lower and to stamp out any recovery with an onslaught of more supply. I worked with large institutional trading desks and NO ONE would ever execute a trade on an open position that would drop the price by 5,10,15% while there was still shares to sold - that‚Äôs BAD trading and anyone who did that would be fired so quick their head would spin. 

This is blatant manipulation of the market and frankly exchanges need to step in and evaluate their customers‚Äô trading activity. No regulators will do this like they do in the stock market so exchanges need to investigate these individual‚Äôs rationale for why they did what they did. If you had 500 BTC to sell and the there were only 5 BTC available on the bid side, would you put 50 BTC up and overwhelm the buy orders to drop the price or would you layer into the market i.e matching up to the buy side to keep your sell price and therefore your profits stable? Anyone who can manage to hodl 500 BTC or more I would assume has a basic understanding on how supply and demand work, this isn‚Äôt incompetence, this is methodological and carefully orchestrated market manipulation. This drop is NOT about fundamentals, it‚Äôs a exercise in disenchanting HODLers and discouraging new-comers and adopters. If we truly want to do something about this, we need to start voicing our concerns to the exchanges. Until then it‚Äôs just rinse and repeat with everyone running around in circles trying to correlate a logical economic rationale to BTC‚Äôs price action where frankly THERE IS NONE. ",1522652391

That assume responsibility. This is, however, wrong assumption from ""crypto movement"" side. Regular people doesn't want to have a responsibility.

"&gt; You also have to consider most of these coins can't be spent anywhere

But.. you can trade it on exchanges, so it can be spent on major coins that can then be spent.

&gt; There's only so long that someone can hold it before they notice it's worthless and sell it before it looses all its value.

Loses*. Coins don't get loose. 

And ""before they notice it's worthless""? There's a lot of coins that aren't worthless and there's a lot of coins that have value because of what people expect them to be worth.

&gt; Maybe if some company makes a virtual credit card that uses your crypto currency it might go up

See my first point. This statement is so ignorant to the current state of things.

&gt; At the end of the day it's just 0 and 1.

At the end of the day Gold is just a shiny metal. USD is just paper (or rather most of it is also just 0 and 1). 

This is so pointless that it isn't even worth mentioning.

&gt; Crypto currency advanced pretty fast and the world didn't have time to catch up.

Absolutely.

&gt; Bitcoin took off because it actually had a use. It was an untraceable coin used to buy illegal goods. The deep web created a use for it which helped it take off.

Maybe in the first few years in the life of BTC this may have been true (well not traceable, but not tracked at the time afaik), but in the context of the run this past year this is just false. Monero (the current standard in such illegal activities now I believe) would be the top coin (if not number 1, in the top 3 due to few fiat trading pairs) if this was the case.

There's a whole lot more interesting use-cases going on in cryptocurrency than buying illegal goods.

"Actually, CoinText.io has pretty bad usability. My Mom has an older phone, so I decided to try an experiment today. I sent her some Bitcoin Cash using CoinText.io, and then tried to have her buy a Starbucks gift card with it. Sounds easy enough, right?

Unfortunately, egifter.com uses BitPay, so they don't give you a payment address, just a BIP70 payment-protocol link. The CoinText.io wallet didn't seem to support this, so we decided to try to cryptonize.it instead.

Ok, so we got the gift card in the cart, and were ready to send the payment. How are we supposed to get the payment address into the phone? Fine, off to the app store to find a QR-code scanner. Once we installed an app and scanned the QR code, we were able to copy / paste the link into the SMS app. Unfortunately, CoinText.io doesn't give you any feedback when you get something wrong, so we had to do this several times until we got the request into the format CoinText.io expected (""send &lt;amount&gt; bch &lt;address&gt;""). Finally, CoinText.io sent us a message back saying the address was in the wrong format. Apparently, cryptonize.it uses the legacy BTC address format, not the new cashaddr format. A quick trip to cashaddr.bitcoincash.org on the PC + making a new QR code at webqr.com + re-scanning the code + re-entering things in to the SMS app, and we were able to buy the gift card! So easy, anybody can do it! /s

Now, maybe we had some user error in this process. Maybe CoinText really does support the legacy payment format, and we just copy-pasted wrong, for example.

Yet at the same time, you can't truly understand, not ever. And so problems in the developed world; be it mental health, a horrible breakup, a life-ending investment, something like rape or a family tragedy, are often (at least in terms of brain chemistry) quite similar. It's really crazy to think about, but there's a ton of studies out there on topics relating to stuff like this that are great reads. It's wild, but there are a ton of investors, both in traditional finance, and crypto, that have ended their lives due to substantial losses. Whether they were acting wholly logically or not, or whether there may have been a future rebound isn't really of great importance, as that's how they felt at the time.

3- Lessons have been learnt from the Innovation playbook: Companies who missed the ‚ÄúDigital‚Äù turn early (kodak, automakers, etc...) don‚Äôt want to be laggards and are experimenting with blockchain: we can see an institutional adoption as early as 2019/2020 (2017: observe - 2018: dedicate budget for experiments).

For most of it's history, it took ~8 Bitcoin Cash to equal 1 Bitcoin Segwit. Currently, the ratio is closer to 11:1. Until we know why, any response will be speculation.

Bitcoin Cash forked from Bitcoin-segwit in order to enable massive scaling. Adoption does always raise the price. It is possible that the price is being pushed down by businesses converting to FIAT immediately after selling goods for BCH; for example.",1522639535

"&gt; Except for the fact that bitcoin probably has the strongest dev team out of the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. Some of the best cryptographers and engineers in the world have been contributing to the software for nearly a decade now.

Except that these particular developers have conveyed consistently throughout the years that they do not have an understanding of the market, nor do they care about end-users, usability, or keeping BTC competitive in the marketplace. 

In fact they have vocally ridiculed anyone who promotes such viewpoints. 

That‚Äôs why BTC is suffering. That‚Äôs why so many forks have come about. So keep that in mind when we talk about how ‚Äúgreat‚Äú they are at cryptography. There‚Äôs been no product development lead in the BTC space, and that‚Äôs a major problem with any development project. 

Gavin Andresen was the last remnant of a Dev who actually understood and cared about the end-users, and the industry. The only people left, care only about the code. They‚Äôve said that much themselves.

You never have developers doing literally everything from start to finish in a project, and thats exactly what Bitcoin has right now. ",1522639485

Having said that I don't know the future as well. I just find it increasingly likely that small scale blockchains will fail (even if they were to be attempted). Like the Internet, blockchain's main power comes from being universal enough (and open to enough opportunities).

I mean we did get Intranets right around the time we were getting the Internet.

Sells who bought in mid-late 2017 are more likely to be buyers at $6000 than people who bought in early 2017, because the early buyers still would need crypto to crash quite a bit further before their overall allocations start to feel small.",1522638994
"Last year the price outgrew the function and cryptocurrency was valued on a purely speculative basis.

Prior to 2017, Bitcoin was actually enjoying niche use as an alternative to fiat with real world use.

But for 20k, slow, expensive transactions, it wasn't living up to the promise. ETH was primarily a platform for ICOs but most ICOs were garbage driven by speculation. Smart contracts etc. are cool, but haven't really been adopted and proven their usefulness as quickly as the price was rising.  Same thing for DAPPS. 
Some other coins have potential for use, but so far have seen very little deployment in the real world. XRP's main banking app, xRapid has only just started to be adopted by financial institutions. Litecoin could have been interesting if Litepay had actually happened.
IOTA, Vechain and WTC are all boasting about real world partnerships, but they're far from showing how the token value is going to be supported.
NANO seems like great tech, but it's nowhere near being actually used and transacted with on any significant level.
Monero can be used for privacy transactions, but Bitcoin was only worth a few hundred when it was filling that role, so whether it needs to be any larger is another question.

I'm not spreading FUD, I'm just looking at the market in terms of actual functionality at this moment or in the immediate future, not long term potential or even the beginnings of practical real world use. 

I think cryptocurrency is going to be huge, but right now it's like a garage band and we're the patrons. Maybe one day it'll be The Rolling Stones, but last year we got over-excited.

"Alright people, first off, to decouple BTC requires something that NO other crypto offers. Various forms of trading IRL cold hard cash to a crypto that isn't BTC isn't easy, in fact many BTC atms are bitcoin only or *offer* altcoin but are usually out of stock.

To decouple BTC from crypto the masses need awareness of other coins and ways to acquire them. The reason everything sinks with BTC is because everything is TIED to bitcoin whether we like it or not.

Bitcoin is still new, it's still getting known, BTC is barely about 9 years old or so and is still a ""delinquent child"". People see BTC as a scam, worthless, fake, etc and will see all other coins in the same light.

With that said there are only two things that will truly cut off the preverbial umbilical cord, a sense of trust to cryptocurrency, and ways to acquire it with USD/Fiat of other forms.

Yes exchanges offer USD to crypto pairings but that's usually *USDT*, Tether holdings, so this doesn't count in the slightest.

"From a technical perspective BCH must lead towards CENTRALIZATION the opposite of centralization.  So you understand centralization is related to power and distributed is the architecture of the system.  They are conflated.   You can have a distributed centralized system but you can't have a decentralized system that is not distributed. 

So the fact that BCH requires more centralization it's invalid IMHO because decentralization is necessary for bitcoin.  You could get the system working technically, but it will need to be centralized.  

BCH has 2 factions.  One is perfectly supportive of centralization and having the banks and government run bitcoin.  The other doesn't seem to support this notion but I don't see them denouncing it either.  

Bitcoin exists and has won sufficiently that it can't be destroyed by the government without expending insane political capital (and even then it wont work) The only way to attack bitcoin is politically.  You must get support for things that weaken the model of bitcoin so it can be controlled by governments. 

According to big blockers the only nodes that matter are the mining pools.  Without P2Pool there are only 5 or so major pools that seem to prevail in these systems.  5 points to target and boom bcash is owned by the government. 

Adoption is meaningless if it's controlled by the government.

I ""felt"" the capitulation below $200, but the charts say it took months for the market to really confirm it and move off the bottom around $200. 

My sense this time is that a lot of money has been pulled out, but not for good this time. It came out when it became clear the market got overheated and a correction was in process, but is waiting to come back in when the bottom is confirmed.

Blocks cannot clear transactions that occur _before_ they are found. How is this at all unusual? How can you distinguish an SM block that had been intentionally withheld from any other block that may experienced propagation delays?

The Bitcoin protocol permits a block's timestamp to vary from the _adjusted network time_ by up to +2 hours. A block's timestamp must be greater than the median of the previous 11 blocks' timestamps, but that is flexible enough that block timestamps can occur out-of-order. Within limits, a block's timestamp can be used as extra nonce bytes and, as it is positioned in the low bytes of the header, timestamp rolling is a viable method for generating ASICBoost compatible block candidates. Over all, block timestamps are only reliable to within 1-2 hours.",1522636004

"A cryptocurrency can ultimately only be considered a real currency and not an investment when it can actually be spent in most/all the same places as FIAT. 

There are people like OmiseGO working on making that happen. Once you can spend a Neo or an ETH at your local grocery store just as easily as you can spend FIAT (if that ever happens) you will then have cryptocoins with actual good technology and super fast transaction speeds that can function as a legitimate medium of exchange. From there, it's just about people picking their favorite coins that they believe will be used by more people. 

A lot of folks believe that's what's happening right now. Outside of BitCoin and a few others, that's just not true. It's complicated both technically and from an accounting perspective right now for a business to take cryptocurrency as payment. Most places who are accepting crypto are simply using Bitcoin with a smaller percentage who have maybe added a couple others.

Yes. You can write a new blockchain with whatever supply system your economists can come up with. You can even do a *central bank authority coin* if you so desire. Will anyone care?

&gt; I think the next big thing you need to tackle is exactly this

You are mistaken.

&gt; I believe you will see lots of people adopt it as a means of payment instead of gambling

When those who use this new system are doing better than those who are stuck with wheelbarrows full of USD, you'll very quickly see this type of ""adoption"". Until then, speculation is ""adoption"".

&gt; Unless you want to keep it as something to gamble with, like betting on sports results or dealing with penny stocks.

How would speculating on the chances of BTC becoming an established currency in the future in any way relate to the types of bets made against sports outcomes?

What happens when a *penny stock* is no longer a penny stock?

"I'm against direct democracy as well, it allows only for the incentivized people to be involved and not the rest.

I think the genious of the blockchain is that it can incentivize even people who wouldn't normally do. I.e. gamers, college students, even a man with a computer shop.

I agree that the Bitmain situation is really bad and probably would be bitcoin's downfall in the longeterm. I also think that if true ASIC resistance is achieved (it would need around the clock maintenance) it would allow for whatever crypto/blockchain that will achieve it to ultimately have the most chances to be the one that is adopted partly or wholly (for certain jobs).

IMO the blockchain is closer to the Internet than it is to direct democracy. The Internet has the added bonus of actually giving a direct reward to the one that is participating (unlike direct democracy which eventually devolves to crowd rule). 

In-so-far that the blockchain follows the Internet's example it can succeed longterm, if it's not, it is not a vast upgrade (if any) to anything current.

As for your example. It would need some kind of conspiracy for it to happen. But given time it *has to* the market creates forces for the many to impose their will to the few. So whoever the many would be (say the 90 companies that are in agreement) would eventually penalise the few (say the 10 that stray).

Such small systems are easy to be manipulated eventually.

Chaotic systems can't/won't.

Do agree that there is a battle to be won (still) for the creation of concensus in extant cryptos. I think bitcoin is already losing the battle, as the miners have disproportionate power, but it is still early, it can well be corrected eventually.

"&gt; Sorry never heard of Liquid

Why is Blockstream keeping it so quiet, despite it being on their site:

https://blockstream.com/liquid/

&gt; Lightning will take a great deal of transactions off the blockchain

Assuming it works and can scale and has positive use cases *over other blockchains*. If BCH is cheap, instant, and easy, why would anyone use Lightning? If a Lightning transaction is $0.30 to transact, and BCH is less than a penny, why use Lightning?

&gt; getting rid of congestion 

Satoshi's plan was for there never to be congestion, because a block cap was not a part of the original plan. In fact BTC originally had no block cap and Satoshi said the scaling solution was just to let block sizes get as big as they want.

&gt; on top of segwit and what ever else efficiency upgrades they have planned,

Except that since they've taken a hard edge against hard-forks, they can only ever soft fork, and that's like coloring within the lines. BTC will always be bounded by its current code, never able to adopt revolutionary new ideas or efficiency gains. Graphene blocks are coming to BCH soon, they'll never be in BTC.

&gt; and then they can always increase the blocksize as necessary with consensus.

Will never happen, because Blockstream won't allow it, because it would reduce the need for 2nd layer solutions. Core has said that congestion, high fees, and full blocks are a good thing. With rhetoric like that coming out of the people controlling BTC, and their demonization of anyone who pushed for a block size increase, I don't see it happening.



&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I think the main reason there was no consensus wasn't only because other options weren't exhausted just yet 

There's a more important reason they attacked increasing the block size, it was because they felt that increasing it would push back the perceived need for 2nd layer solutions by a couple of years.

&gt;but mainly because bitcoin was still so young and they feared a fork creating so called coins out of thin air would lead to a loss of confidence (go figure, given what happened since the coinbase rollout of bch). 

They created FUD to get their way, no blocksize increase. And it worked.

Remember when the 2x fork was announced, there was greater than 85% support for the fork to happen. There would've been absolutely no problem forking to 2x. Yet they destroyed that too.

&gt; I think things will be different on the consensus front when bitcoin has matured.

&gt; I just don‚Äôt see the point in that.

Well you don't see a point in a crypto card because it is centralized, but you said that centralized systems are better for payments. It's an odd issue to point out. But you are correct they are centralized and of course not what Bitcoin was intended to be, but I disagree that there is no point in using them. You can stay 100% in crypto and spend everywhere cards are accepted. Excellent when traveling cause you don't pay any fees, or very small fees. This way I can use Bitcoin for payments even if it's not on chain rather that waiting years for the local shop to accept crypto. It is basically a shortcut to the period when everyone accept Bitcoin and buying coffee with Bitcoin makes sense. Now it doesn't. Bitcoin's use case as payment now is sending money where is impossible/expensive/not anonymous to send via other means, which for most are below 5% of their payments. Paying coffee doesn't make sense unless you are 100% in crypto. So I don't believe Bitcoin is gonna out compete payment for buying coffee or local bank transfers until it becomes widely accepted. That may never happen but until then it will be used where it is really needed, most likely not in 1st world countries. And until then you can use it as store of value which imo is more important than payments right now. But it may be the case that we need payments first to justify store of value. Chicken-egg dilemma.

See, the -10 thing in the SM plays tricks on the mind ;)

It comes from the ""if you pick a random point, then its 10 minutes either way 

(minutes - picking a random point in time)
-10  ---  0  ---- +10

So Selfish Mining **therefore** chooses to say ""Let's start at -10 then! because either way its 10 minutes, right? That's how bitcoin works ye? a total of 20 minutes between blocks""

so, -10 -- 0 (SM finds a block) -- and because its 10 minutes either way from any random point in time! (and HM is 15 minutes), lets make it +15 from 0 (for the HM to find a block).

hmmm wait a second ... is it really a 20 minutes average between blocks? while it is true to say from any random point in time its 10 minutes either way, is it true to say the same when you are **considering a point in time** (a previous block) no, no its not. 

Or must we say if the HM starts from -10 then it finds a block at +5, **regardless** of whether SM finds and hides a block, and because of how bitcoin works, it doesn't (blockchain, 10 mins average, not 20)

"Both of your statements are assumptions based on your understanding and experience with the bitcoin network.  Neither are demonstrated to be true.  

&gt; The node from which a block is initial announced is not necessarily the node which generated it. Any strategy that attempts to ban nodes based on the being the source of broadcast will be vulnerable to abuse.

If you can identify selfishly mined blocks, then you can discard and not relay them yourself, and ban any node that relays.  And they in turn could have chosen to have identified them, and not relayed them.

&gt; On a per-block basis, selfish blocks are indistinguishable from honest blocks.

I am not sure how this is relevant.  The selfish mining ideal is releasing two blocks, to cause HM's first block to be made irrelevant, and ideally HM to build on the second SM block.   SM cannot ever release one block in any meaningful way, without getting orphaned.

Can you lay out how you reconciled how a selfish miner would choose timestamps for their blocks, without knowing when they would be released or the circumstances under which they would be required to be released?

If timestamps weren't on your radar, and you accept that they are locked in at time of mining, and that two blocks need to be released by SM, then what else might not be on your or my radar?",1522630994

I wasnt treated the same and there was only one female speaker amongst the many male speakers. Many of the men in the audience immediately didnt take her seriously and the mood changed since she was a woman. I was also kicked out of the conference i was given permission in advance to photograph with no explanation as to why i was kicked out. Lots of women are standing up about similar experiences though ""the blockchain bros.""

Anyone can say ""i have tested it and have results, but you're not gonna see them!"" it needs peer review.

But this is missing the point, Peter knows full well he has never run an empirical test on SM, he doesn't even pretend he's tested it, because he just stated ""The maths in the SM paper is correct, therefore it doesn't need testing, and its FACT.""

This isn't how the scientific method works (as well as the ""i'm gonna hide my testing results so no one can peer review, haha"").

SM is a problem, it was the seed that Blockstream grew from, it gave reason for all the ""Bitcoin is broken"", not even joking, and now its being used again with the same smear/silence tactics coinciding with it for a push to integrate a ""solution"" (weakblocks) that is NOT needed

Basically, SM is a cancer, it needs to be stamped out and explained how its wrong in numerous ways so that enough people understand so we do NOT have another similar occurrence.

Otherwise, in a couple of years it'll be the next ""Lead Scientist"" saying ""OMG Selfish Mining is LEGIT, let's BREAK bitcoin with some new bullshit that puts developers in charge and breaks the economic fundamentals and structure""

The same applies to my crypto.

I liquidated small(ish) portions at 15k because that was my target. It didn't hurt seeing it go to 19k. That wasn't my target.

At 1MB blocks every 10 minutes Bitcoin can handle about 7TPS:

7TPS = (1,000,000bytes / block) * (1txn / 250bytes) * (block / 600s)

-------------------------------------------------------------

Now lets assume Bitcoin Cash has scaled up successfully to handle VISA's 1500 TPS average.  How big must the blocks be?

bytes/block = (1500txn / s) * (250bytes / txn) * (600s / block) = **225MB/block**

Per day storage requirements = (225MB / block ) * (6 blocks / hour) * (24hours / day) = **32.4GB/day**

----------------------------------------------

225MB blocks and 32.4GB additional storage per day means very few people can run full nodes.  Very few people running nodes means it's not decentralized.  If it's not decentralized then what's the point?

- energy stocks ... meh... lost overall. Some OK gains but a couple went to zero

- mining. always stayed away as it's a shitshow except for a couple, but no major gains either

- DOW... not many more gains overall than a good bond. Some wins but the losses flatted out (mostly around 2008)

Tech was the best overall gain. Had I thrown more into ones like APPL or GOOG I would have done much better in hindsight, but instead diversified with varying results. Ones like NVDA were countered by a disastrous decade for AMD, and ho hum results for ones like MSFT and INTL.

There is an expectation in the crypto community that crypto is some egalitarian project designed to save the world and make everything fair - it's not. Most people involved - not all, but most - are in it to make money.


The thing to remember about the manipulation and about 'whales' and their bots is that they are the ones who are most invested in this, and while there is money to be made in this song and dance the music will keep going. I can't profess to knowing their motivations, but I would assume they might want to:


A). Increase their fiat wealth and use their large BTC holdings to manipulate the market up and down so they trade in the chop and also margin trade swap contracts in the same mess they create


B). Increase their BTC wealth using the same method above to shake out noobies and weaker hands and buy cheap BTC.


If the end goal for most of them is to amass as much BTC as possible - which is my gut feeling - then all the smaller investors can sleep easy, because ultimately these guys would never let it fall to nothing and disappear.


However, if their end goal is to simple use BTC as a vehicle to make fiat and they have no intention of keeping BTC long term - well... then we may have a pretty big problem on our hands.

"Bitcoin and cryptocurrency are decoupled technologically. If you spend or lose some BTC, it has no impact on the rest of cryptocurrency.


What you might be upset about is Bitcoin's value as a market-maker and its influence on the other coins. I know, I know, everyone likes to think all these other coins are so different. So unique. But they're not. Their tech might be, but their purpose in the currency sphere is not. My best example of this is. . . . .


Try to cash out any other crypto besides Bitcoin. It's simply difficult with all other coins compared to Bitcoin (cash out back to USD is what I mean). Almost everyone who holds crypto has to sell their coins for BTC ultimately to hit LocalBitcoins or whatever site/service you use to finally translate back to fiat. And because of Bitcoin's market-maker status, the early adopters have a lot of impact when they sell. But they're completely allowed to sell. It's just all the other coins follow suit because you can't cash those coins out without BTC. BTC price falls, so does your ability to cash out at the same value. 


If there was a site setup like LocalBitcoins but for all of the other crypto, you might actually see better stability in those other coins. I see guys post daily how their deposits and withdraws for $10k are getting stuck for months on the exchanges?? That's insane. But I can take my BTC and sell on LocalBitcoins instantly and get my fiat. No problems. You never see issues with LocalBitcoins. 


And maybe some of the alts do have a LocalBitcoin equivalent, but clearly the markets barely know about it as they're reacting to BTC exclusively. 


One final thought too, overall Bitcoin is still up 34% just over these last 4 months. And it's up 700% over this last year! The only people to be losing any money right now are folks who fomo'd in Nov/Dec really. That really was bubble-territory and anyone looking at the graphs saw it. We had posts on Reddit constantly about that hyperbolic climb. Folks knew.


Remember, no matter what tech is behind each coin, they're all the same currency. So whichever coin is most used and accepted IS the market-maker. If another coins does consistently more transactions, it will become the new benchmark coin. All other coins will rise and fall on average with it.",1522626102

I plan on slowly dollar cost averaging as the crypto market nears the bottom (and maybe when it starts to gain support). If you have the $$$, then I would suggest maybe adding a few dollars every few days or so until the bottom and then picking a few coins that you think have the potential to really rally in the next bull run. I think you should just hold what you originally put in since you will more than likely get that money back by the end of the year (knock on wood).

If I could give you a word of advice, I would caution against the whole HODL strategy.

They don't get the tech, do they?

How can someone have a blockchain that is worth a damn without an incentive system (cryptocurrency) is beyond me. All those talking heads have no idea what are they talking about, they either don't get it in the least or they simply muddy the waters (for whatever reason).

I mean the true power of Bitcoin and the likes is that it is decentralized as the early Internet was. In fact it gets one step further. Not only the content but also the nodes are decentralized. How the *heck* can you have a decentralized system if you have centralized power?

If those bureaucrats want the blockchain to succeed they have to abandon the idea that they have to control each step of the way. It's not how it goes. Either that or abandon the idea of the blockchain altogether.

"What would you pair them against? 

The long term goal of crypto is completely moving away from fiat so pairing against any fiat is a step in the wrong direction, they're already trackable against fiat via btc.

If you're thinking that decoupling btc from other coins will reduce volitility, I think you greatly are mistaken.
1) It's not the price movement in btc that's causing alts to swing, it's swings in the market cap of the entire market.
2) currently no currency or utility token is an overall improvement from traditional fiat, banking or company. I'm not saying they won't be, but given this fact all coins are wildly overpriced from thier actual use atm (the gap being speculation)

BTC is not the best blockchain technology but it is by far the best tested and proven and most widely adopted. When it comes to storing / investing parts of your portfolio and especially wealth, you desire tried and true over new and flashy (think of people still flocking to gold and silver in economically turbulent times)

Also, btc isn't completing against most coins. I find it puzzling why btc dominance is watched or commented on. It's akin to trying to compare USD to apple market cap. Btc against the sum of other currency tokens would be interesting to look at tho. ",1522624485

There cannot be just one company, coin, etc., serving all purpose! 

Block chain companies which do not directly compete with their product will coexist serving different industries just like current tech companies do. 

I personally expect Bitcoin to be replaced at some point within the next 5 years and a more advanced currency will be the new digital gold standard. There are already much faster and economic options out there now. 

As we increasingly are able to directly trade currencies without bitcoin as an intermediate exchange vehicle, we will see the market becoming independent of Bitcoin and a better technology will take over.",1522624270
"independence or decentralization is not binary. It's better to have more than less. Obviously it's very hard (or maybe impossible) to have a working society without some sort of government or rules, but with bitcoin you have definitely more freedom and control over your money and the government and banks have less control and knowledge about you. You can go where you want and take everything with you without much of a hassle and pretty much without anyone knowing how much you have if you did it right. Nobody can take it from you without force. If a government starts waterboarding millions of people for their bitcoin, I think we have bigger problems to worry about than just financial freedom.

The other route was what were seeing now, bitcoin got too much attention, soared to new highs and the markets realized its intended use as a currency is not worth the price (mainly high transac fees and long processing times) thus the crash... which may mean months to recover... 

We took the route of securing the network first but delaying adoption and possibly scaring off adopters (took few years before wall street started touching tech companies after the bubble)...

"Google, Facebook, MSN, etc are all networks that are connected to the internet. There isn't one internet e-mail service or one website. The internet is a connector of smaller networks throughout the while world.

Bitcoin will always be around and be a major player. However, it could never be the ONLY cryptocurrency. It's simply not the best for small transactions and the greater the adoption the worse it would get. Etherium does things better than Bitcoin in some respects. Bitcoin is the biggest and easiest to get but it's not always the easiest to use. ",1522623200
"Here's my take on those points.

1) This is best done through supporting adoption. That means ensuring that people are able to transact. That might not always be reasonable through block size increase but right now, Bitcoin has laughably small blocks and there is no excuse not to increase the block size *while continuing to encourage second layer solutions*

2) Transactions, when not being processed under monopoly conditions, should provide a small profit margin over the cost to process to miners. We're talking of processing and storing 250 odd bytes, something which Reddit has done for your comment for free (admittedly it is a different thing but I'm trying to provide perspective). This is not credit cards. 10-50c is way too high. Many of Bitcoin's benefits potentially involve multiple transactions (move to cold storage, condensing UTXOs and even LN operations) and many of the possible killer-app use cases of Bitcoin depend on lowish fees.

3) I don't necessarily agree. We should try and avoid being wasteful  and certainly shouldn't be encouraging unnecessary expansion but Bitcoin works best when allowed to operate under market conditions.

I agree that BCH will get Layer 2. It already has u\/tippr and exchanges count somewhat. LN has problems that may or may not get sorted but it's not the only option out there. Very few BCH people out there actually oppose LN, we just think it's a poor excuse for crippling the world's #1 crypto-currency and that the problems it continues to have should not be soft-pedaled to hide the incompetence of those who used it as such.",1522623190

"No one can use bitcoin independently from governments or banks.

the majority of trade is done on government regulated exchanges/payment processors, over government regulated internet and power infrastructure, using government money and centralized payment processors (also regulated by the government).

what little is happening outside of those heavily centralized channel is still heavily reliant on the availability of those channels to create enough confidence in liquidity and other forms of government payment and infrastructure (i.e. localcoins still requires people to have bank accounts or fiat cash to be able to trade, and government internet to facilitate the trades)

It's not possible to run something like bitcoin without centralized telecoms and power infrastructure. So long as governments are still in charge of who gets to lay fiber optic cable through neighborhoods and who gets to launch satellites into space that isn't likely to change. And so long as decentralized power represents only a tiny of fraction of the worlds energy supply its also not practical to do PoW without regulated government power infrastructure.

"The answer is ... it depends. 

If your coins are on coinbase you're not really using Bitcoin.  So if you want to learn and start using Bitcoin taking control of your bitcoin is a great way to start.

Depending on how much value you need to protect you're going to need to take different approaches.  If it's pocket change bitcoin you can have a wallet on your phone.  If it's a mid term hodl then maybe a hardware wallet.  If it's a long term hodl for lambos then you should consider offline HD wallet secured with fireproof manner.  

Some axioms for security are as follows. 

If it's convenient it's not secure.  

You need to measure your security based on your exposure and risk.  The higher the risk the more effort needs to be placed in mitigating exposure.  The more risk the more effort and steps you need to take in order to secure.

So which wallet and the approach you take to secure it varies depending on your intended use and how much you're securing.

If you're storing 10 bucks and want to buy a movie it's fine on your phone.  

If it's a few grand with a purchase here and there maybe a hardware wallet. 

If it's a few hundred grand you aren't touching for a few years multiple copies fire proof.

If it's a few million then you're talking some serious security measures.  Global distribution encrypted seeds destroyed computers fair dice entropy.

Not to mention after you get a few grand you really need to begin considering legitimate means of estate planning.

However, I do think that will pave the way for more investment over the longer haul. 

Actual use will happen more slowly. For someone who wants to get into bitcoin, you might say, download a wallet... make sure it has segwit support...and a good algorithm so you don't overpay fees... and be careful because app stores an dgoogle and stocked with fraudulent version of the wallet, so make sure you get the true one... and make sure you back up your wallet correctly so you don't loose all your bitcoin... and get a cold wallet (and there a bunch of security precautions there too)... and hope that the fees don't go up again so you won't pay too much to move move money between your wallets.

"Let me get things straight:

1) KuCoin has a due diligence process prior to listing tokens. The delay can be due to many reasons. First, it may be because the development team has no real history and the coin has no real background nor necessity. If it qualifies as a shitcoin, chances of listing are greatly diminished. Secondly, the team applied for a listing during the bull run, when KuCoin was overwhelmed with insane demand. Since it's an asynchronous exchange, the developers were more focused on keeping their exchange functioning rather than please some no-name developer's listing wishes.

2) They gave them a listing price, 5 BTC. They clearly specified that paying the fee would get them into a queue for listing, not an instant listing. There are other coins with much bigger communities and better use cases waiting to get listed there because they applied before them. New rules were implemented and they were nice enough to let them know about it instead of going into radio silence with 5 BTC still missing.

Advice to avoid these situations: Start with the smaller exchanges if your coin is unknown and your team still needs to show what they can do before the bigger exchanges trust you.

The fact that these developers only cared about the huge exchanges right after their token shows me several red flags:

1) They were attempted to garner as much volume as possible to pump and dump their own coin.

2) They had a clear intention to sell their bags while knowing that listing a fresh new token into a large volume exchange right after the sale would make it a pump and dump fest and very unsafe for the token sale investors.

Who's guilty here ?

Both parties. KuCoin for struggling to keep up with the demand and changing the rules after accepting payment, and the token developers being greedy clowns.",1522621854

Lets say I do one now at block 561250 or whatever.

You also have to consider most of these coins can't be spent anywhere. There's only so long that someone can hold it before they notice it's worthless and sell it before it looses all its value.

Crypto currency advanced pretty fast and the world didn't have time to catch up. Bitcoin took off because it actually had a use. It was an untraceable coin used to buy illegal goods.

That's why bitpay was accepted by more major retailers than bitcoin by itself was, because bitpay was more useful than bitcoin despite the fact it was more centralized than just direct transfer.

In reality you can't use bitcoin without centralization.

"There's a lot of talk about ASICs, something that in my mind there is no real solution to in PoW, yet people keep throwing constant attention at this problem. Meanwhile, the entire market is coupled to BTC and there's nothing to be done.

Really though, people can't make it happen by ""spreading the word"". All exchanges started with a BTC trade pair as the base. Almost every crypto has at least a BTC trade pair on almost every exchange. Many people all over the world can't buy anything with their fiat except for BTC, and therefore cannot buy anything else with any other currency. As long as this is the case, BTC will be a major on ramp for all liquidity in the market. Most of it has to pass through the BTC supply, in and out. So any time some coin or token or whatever loses liquidity, that liquidity temporarily passes through BTC and then out of it. The prices will continue to follow BTC as long as this is the case.

Another nefarious thing: people get shit on for saying it, but there's market manipulation going on. People doing this benefit from the trade pair situation because they can manipulate a market cap much higher than BTC, and they can influence the demand for just about everything. There's a feedback loop to this too: we all know that everything is tied to BTC, so we buy/sell other coins, and the effect is amplified.

Want to put a stop to it? You have to:

1. Convince exchanges to support another trade pair (or more) to account for more than 50% of volume of the entire crypto market, including small countries (I suggest ZWD),

2. Convince everybody using BTC price movement as a buy/sell signal to ignore their best interest.

Quite a problem to mobilize millions to collectively solve. Things like that rarely happen in free markets. The demand is for BTC and the BTC is king by demand.

It will happen, but not by mass mobilization. It will happen by huge crashes, followed by market cap growths of other networks after those crashes outpacing bitcoin. First, Ethereum will flip, then others will follow, then BTC won't account for &gt;50% of volume across exchanges, and hopefully nothing ever will again. It is going to be very painful.",1522620812

"I see two issues with this though you fairly adequately dealt with the first one, which is the general understanding of how little protection a token offers. This understanding isn't commonplace. People truly believe that they're buying something akin to a share. Even if they did their own research and read up on everything that there is to know about the the token, it still is complete quicksand as the documentation is meaningless without investor protection.     
Which leads to the  second, more fundamental issue, and that is the lack of ability of crypto companies to fairly compete with each other. If you can make everything up, completely change the deal whenever you want (like create more supply out of thin air, or just exit scam and bail on the bagholders), or even just overpromise on your roadmap, then there's no way for any other company to legitimately compete with that without inventing their own meaningless hype.   
What I'm trying to say is, without transparency and accountability, any investing is blind. Nobody is able to do their due diligence, and those who said they're doing it are full of shit. This SEC regulation doesn't just exist to protect investors, it exists to make the free market as effective as possible in differentiating between the winners and the losers.

"Let me ask you an honest question.  What do you think has to happen for it to go back up?  At first I thought it was going to go up with bitcoin as well as the other alt coins but seems the powers that be want it to be in absolute direct competition with btc (why this sub seems to have been created).  So would bitcoin have to go down entirely to bch's levels?  

How likely is that and how long do you think it could take in such a hypothetical?  Also if bitcoin went up, that would likely mean things have succeeded in the scaling front and it continues to improve, thus would bch be able to rise with it for long and if so for what purpose?  Either way bitcoin would need to rise even greater with that scenario.   

So what is your road map, time table, and how likely is it?  ",1522619365

3) Get them comfortable using Crypto and hope they choose to continue using it.

"&gt; Crypto will never be a form of currency. That‚Äôs quite obvious. Some things need to be centralised I think the current payment services will be hard to beat.

How are fiat payment services better? 

Speed. Some like Paypal are instant but are not always free and more importantly are not available in many countries like Turkey, some in Eastern Europe never mind Africa. Bitcoin is not instant it's 10 minutes but that is ok for online payments. For retail 0 conf on small payments is also ok. You can also use a Visa card connected to your crypto wallet which is instant just like 0 conf. Compared to any banking payment Bitcoin is superior on many levels. 

Price. Again, competition is from apps not regular banking payments which lose on every levels. Some 3rd party apps have free payments like VEnmo. So do some crypto wallets like TenX. On chain payments are in the realm of cents regardless of the amount. Crypto's advantage is that it is global.

UI. Mobile crypto apps are on par with regular apps. The desktop node apps are a little clunkier to use.

Crypto has a few advantages that no payment system has. So I say we are on the right track to disrupt payments. Maybe not hipsters buying coffee.

Honestly, that's stupid investing advice.

I find the opposite to be true. If you see an obvious bandwagon, it's often easy money to jump on board. The winners are often running for a reason, and the opposite is true as well.

""accepting the lose and cashing out"" 

Sunken cost fallacy, don't ever think like that with investments. Where you bought and how much you have gained or lost makes 0 difference to the current state of the investment and should not affect your decisions.

Honestly, 90% of the people here are purely gambling.

To exit a position the same approach should be taken in order to minimize exposure to the volatility of the market.",1522618079

"2017 was completely insane. Simply adding the word ‚Äúblockchain‚Äù into something made its value spike as we saw with everything from hosting to iced tea companies, suddenly it became the greatest technological innovation ever. Bitcoin being the standard-bearer became the equivalent of ""digital gold"", a new narrative that completely goes against the very reason d'etre for Bitcoin existing according to Satoshis whitepaper.

Thousands of projects appeared out of nowhere and raised huge amounts of capital, mostly by utilizing Ethereum. They were also completely unrestricted by securities law. You can get hundreds of millions of dollars with absolutely no actual obligation to shareholders. There are no shareholders. If you own a particular crypto, you own nothing but a unit of exchange on a particular protocol/network. Development on this protocol or network can stop on a whim, or not even exist at all as we've seen with EOS.

It seems a lot of people are slowly waking up to this now, and now with tax season deadlines coming up quick a lot are also realizing taxation on daytrading will be a nightmare. So they're giving it up and unloading back into the safety of fiat. And in a market dominated by the BTC/Fiat pairing as the entry and exit point, it means everything falls right along even if its a solid project putting out good news.

It turned into a complete mess, and few people would listen to the sceptical voices back in December and January. Anyone giving projections of Bitcoin going down or telling people they sold in Decemeber was called a FUDster.

"&gt; Do you think that miners will consistently mine empty blocks just because they're easier to mine? Do you understand how economics works?

OMFG you're so fucking stupid.  If you broadcast an invalid block you don't get the reward.  IF you can't get the block, but know that your competitor who is mining found a block you can take the header and start hashing it yourself, but without knowing all the included transactions in the block the only safe way to do it is with empty blocks.  Bitmain has done mining blocks intentionally this is in Jihan's thing.  If you're given the choice between a guaranteed 125000 dollars you're going to take it.  Sure once the block comes in and is verified you'll add transactions to your block and mine, but if you find a valid hash before you get the block verified you're going to push an empty block.  It's the same in sales realtors buyers and sellers will push sales for immediate execution over maximum value (in the clients best interest) because it's in their best interest.  It's a numbers game.  It's better to get 5 deals done at 80% value  than 3 deals done 100%  market value.   Same thing with head hunters better to get people in companies cheap and fast than for maximum salary.  Their average commission is smaller but they get more sales. 

This has been done in the real world on bitcoin by BItmain so don't come here with your hypothetical bullshit.  I'm lecturing history here not theoretical economic game theory. 

bitcoin is new and very anti-fragile.  We survived the spamming attack towards the end of last year and we're thriving now.  Back at 45% dominance.  The hardforking bananza is over and btrash is now sitting at less than 10% of bitcoin.

"I have a deep fundamental understanding of Bitcoin and it's place on the world stage, from a technical perspective with my university education in computer science and distinguished career as a software engineer.   I'm trained in rational thought and through my career I have honed my logic and critical thinking skills to be as sharp as a razor's edge.  

I'm rate limited here because btrashers shit themselves when I overwhelm them with my facts, rational reasoning that entirely obliterates their position on multiple levels and perspectives.  It's an all out war firing on all fronts.  I make their own ideas and thoughts betray them and stab them in the heart with their own positions after I nuke it from orbit and blast it from underneath.  Literally every figurative perspective you can think of I address it.  If someone disagrees with one of my posts its either they didn't read or failed to comprehend the sheer detail of my retort.  You can see some of my past posts answering things like Graphene and how it's useful in comparison to sending entire blocks, but bitcoin already incorporates many of the practices recommended in graphene already and without some crucial sacrifices that have serious negative consequences to the game theory basis of bitcoin cash graphene offers no measurable advantage over what is already implemented in core.  

My beef with btrash is purely political in nature.  Bitcoin must remain nation state hard. Btrash can work on a technical level if and only if it is centralized.  Most people don't even understand the difference between decentralized and distributed they are not interchangeable terms this is a large pet peeve of mine.  

It's important for bitcoin to remain as decentralized and distributed as possible among every facet we can and be constantly improving it on each level.  It doesn't have to be 100% perfect now but consistently improving is what matters.

That was the absolute bottom with silk road having recently shut shop and the future of adoption as bleak as ever with noone left but people too rich to care or true ancaps who really would rather see their attempt against big money completely fail before giving up their coins .  Everyone shits on btc's ideology for being anarchists, they don't know believing in what btc is there to do is all that we ever had. Ain't noone can take that from us until we give it up. 

Plus I see many more believers in the ranks now, Old OGs who bought in the 2014 crash look at this and all they see is a new breed of people forming the floor that will simply never be breached.

Miners are the *most invested users on the network*, if they consistently mined empty blocks the mempool would clog IP and you'd have another BTC Q4 2017 event which would destroy faith in the network and make the block rewards meaningless.

I'm a student who believes in crypto but is broke and live in a country where the USD is very high . So it's a bit investment for me.

"Bots link everything. So if btc goes down bots sell btc to buy tether or ETH then either hold that or buy alts. The net change is if btc goes down so does everything else.

Because there isn't much liquidity in crypto it doesn't take many ask bids to crash the price of a different coin. ",1522615521
"Here‚Äôs my thought. Let‚Äôs say I have $7000. And I owe $7000 this month for financing on my equipment. 

If I spend that $7000 for the financing of my equipment then I don‚Äôt have $7000 to buy bitcoin. I could however run my equipment. 

I will likely have already paid or will have to to pay X amount for electricity (in the future) whether I use or don‚Äôt use my equipment (assuming that‚Äôs my agreement with the electricity company). 

If I did happen to have tons of extra fiat I still wouldn‚Äôt spend it on BTC at these prices when I could mine, because fiat is so valuable to have on hand. Now if BTC went to $1 (and I felt it would recover) then I suppose I‚Äôd absolutely buy it up. It comes down to the risk/reward for using my fiat. 

I see your point, and I could be wrong on this but that‚Äôs how I currently feel.

"Just a layman here, but as I understand it ETH has some good tech while BTC is as of right now just the standard currency used between exchanges which forces users to use BTC for example Binance etc. This means that the price of BTC moves the whole market and when crypto exchanges start accepting Fiat BTC will no longer have any value since its tech is shit. ETH, as I understood it (not sure if this applies to the crypto or if it's just the Ethereum network) has very good tech behind it. Am I in the wrong here? Even if ETH is getting hit harder than BTC currently ETH should survive based on the little I know.",1522615421
"I think it depends on how you use it, if you leave the keys and access and transactions on US soil for example, you wouldn't have to.  If you have 1 BTC in the US, travel to europe and withdraw/spend 0.5 BTC in europe, you have effectively transferred that money overseas and has to be declared over a certain amount (though with BTC's current value I think it falls under that limit of not having to.)",1522615414

Bitcoin Cash serves this purpose perfectly. I can pull bitcoin cash out of my savings and spend it anywhere that has a wallet (which, thanks to CoinText, is now as simple as having a phone number). Thanks to 0-conf and blocks that are never full, one can *always* send that money to anyone they want within seconds for 1 sat / byte (at current value, less than a penny). 

Since when is being ‚Äúinstant‚Äù an essential property of cash? Cash has never in the history of the world been instant. Nor will it ever. Paper cash takes a few seconds to pull out, count, and hand over, to be counted again. Cash doesn‚Äôt need to be instant, just very fast.",1522614852

Ultimately, is it worth shelving an idea like this?

And finally, as people have stated here that they can use lightning network with bch, btc can increase the blocksize as necessary just the same.  After-all, these hypotheticals seem well into the future right?

This is not a reliable form of crypto buying. It is essentially ether craigslist. Let me rephrase: until my grandma can safely buy any coin without it feeling like a drug deal any coin will not be able to decouple.

as far as alts go is see litecoin, ethereum and monero in their own class.... and then theres a huge gap... and then all the other scamcoins",1522614404
We are not going to have a run AND have BTC and ETH die. Just not going to happen. If BTC dies everything will die with it. Now we can have BTC go sideways or slightly up and have the alts rally more. If we did start having a bull run ETH will go up as well.,1522614369

if it had gone straight up and was sitting at 50k now, would you happily take your profit, or gamble on it continuing to 100k?",1522614354

"If you are asking me for my personal opinion, then bear in mind that I am not an oracle. My opinion is that BTC should have strong enough resistance at about 5k, and is likely to quickly rebound to a mean of 6-6.5k before stabilizing somewhat. For BCH the numbers are 600 and 650. We could very well be in the bottom under the mean today.

Zero-conf (&lt;10 second delay) can reliably handle low amounts for $200 or less. Inconsistent fees and confirmation times happened because BlockStream/Core refused to raise the block size. Hence Bitcoin Cash was born.,1522614188

"Here's something that's generally accepted elsewhere.  Fib levels.  Notice the exact levels that are being pumped/dumped at.   Human psychology isn't that precise.

Who determines/creates that utility?

Where does the current concentration of utility-creators lie?

"Currency payments, in a shop or checkout I meant. Mining times are too slow and I believe they always will be to a point. Reverse transactions or insurance is a must as well. No one will use it if they worried they could lose their funds. Inconsistent transaction times make it fail as a currency.

It doesn‚Äôt serve any purpose as a currency. Why bother with something as slow and inconsistent as bitcoin when there are other alternatives that already exist?",1522612902
"I'm not talking about switching sides.  I'm talking about taking this sub back for Bitcoin and kicking the btrashers out.  I understand why /r/bitcoin moderates and I don't blame them.  You and your sock puppet accounts are out there everyday relentlessly putting out disinformation.  My god the level of understanding of bitcoin that normies have is pitiful they might as well say bitcoin is a series of tubes. 

Unlike them I have a sound understanding of bitcoin.  I understand why BCH leads to centralization of control of the coin.  I understand why PoS cannot possibly work from a game theory perspective.  I understand that PoW is creating a barrier to protect the blockchain which is literally thermodynamically provable.

"&gt;And yet that still isn‚Äôt tribalism. Craig Wright is not a tribe or a group of people. He may well have pretended to be a tribe at some point. But that‚Äôs not the same thing.

You and seweso are the tribe convinced that somehow CSW is against you.

&gt;Criticising Craig Wright because of shitty dishonest things he did in the past is the special form of cognitive bias known as ‚Äúmemory‚Äù.

Those ""lies"" were done for his own personal reasons, to protect his own privacy, and that should be none of your concern. Troubling lies are lies where the community is manipulated, consensus is manipulated and Bitcoin is manipulated to become ""store of value"" instead of ""digital cash"". Your interpretation of those lies in such a way as to serve your tribalistic narrative is a special form of amnesia known as *selective amnesia*.

&gt;I remember that he is the guy who tried to claim to be Satoshi. I remember that he offered up proof which was found to be fake.

Because of selective amnesia, you are forgetting the fact that he provided proof in private to several people and companies with whom he is still in business. He was pushed by third parties to provide public proof which he refuted to do. Either way, this is in the past. And you bringing this up every time he releases a paper shows that you are enslaved by the very tribal monkey logic you seem to criticise.  Apparently CSW betrayed your tribe back in 2015 when he refused to provide public proof. And you won't forgive him for that. 

&gt;I remind other people of these important lies and deceptions he attempted to pull because lying deceptive people tend to tell further lies and attempt further deceptions more often than people who are not known frauds.

You are not doing this to warn people of CSW but as part of your tribal monkey logic which entitles you to take vengeance against anyone that threw a plastic banana at you back in 2015.

&gt;None of the criticisms I make against Craig Wright say anything about BCH or its users.

That's good. Most of the criticism I have seen you make against CSW are often completely OFF topic, and because of the tribal monkey logic that controls your behavior whenever CSW comes up, you bring up in parrot fashion the lies he told back in 2015. Lies which if actually lies would have destroyed him in the first place and had no potential whatsoever to do any damage to bitcoin. Yet here he is after 2 years more respected than ever by his business partners. Only strangers like you who have never met or dealt with CSW, but who joined tribes when CSW refused to provide public proof, are still mad at him and resort to tribal monkey logic whenever CSW comes up.

"I freely admit I invested to make money.  I read up on the technology, and followed its growth since 2014.  I took the plunge last fall and bought around 5-6K.  It appeared to be a sound investment.  Huge growth rate, even with high transaction cost. With the Lightning network allowing for liquidity pools, it seemed promising. Yet with all the new technology and project-funded ICOs (some with tangible results), I'm back to where I started last year.  All of my gains are now lost.  

What kind of investment is that? I could do better with stocks, by spreading between low, medium, and high volatility.  Crypto is all high, and it doesn't follow the news.  It follows the spin of the roulette wheel (and even that has better odds).

So what due diligence is everyone here referring to that I should have done so I would be a smarter investor? Or are you saying the smart invest is to keep holding, when in two years BTC could be worth 100K, or it could be worth zero? Even I could give that type of advice. Buy that piece of land in New York City.  It'll either appreciate when new commercial projects develop around it, or be worth zero if North Korea bombs the city.   That's what we are saying here.

I don't understand what there is to study up on and make smart buys when the market plunges even with new tech and projects introduced. That, to me, is a bubble.  And with Bitcoin futures, it's Lehman Brother's all over again.

Sure, I could hold and stay the course for another couple of years, as people on here think the ""smart Investor"" would do.  But if a stock plunges, I don't hold it just because I believe in the product.  I look at the overall market. I look for other opporunities. I don't wait until my money runs dry in one and say oh well. Too bad for me, but at least my heart was in it.

90% of the people in here are looking at price and market cap, and when they see it go to shit they cut their losses and their out. Maybe they will return if it picks up.  Until then, they invest in something else, to make money, which is what investment is all about. Am I way off base here in wanting to make money?  Call me crazy, I guess. ",1522611282
"No, it doesn't.  All these shitty altcoins would be worth nothing if they weren't coupled to BTC.  If you want average market valuations for your cryptos, rather than these astronomical market caps for super questionable coins, many of which aren't even operational, then sure, decouple the price from BTC.  

These are cryptocurrencies, it's a market.  The dow jones goes up and down together, same story.  Cryptos go down or up together, that's how closed markets work.  In the stock market the biggest stocks tend to be the fang stocks, if they take a hit, everything gets hit.  BTC is our biggest player, of course its price is going to affect every other price.

as i've come to accept, i can be bad at explaining myself, communication barriers, assumptions of knowledge or something, sometimes people simply don't understand the meaning of the words i use (it's surprised me how many people don't understand what the word **theory** means, or the concepts **empirical testing** and **scientific method**, so i have to stop, explain to someone else, and know that it'll eventually get around to them in a way they'll understand

once people understand how connected miners are then other pieces of the puzzle will start to fall into play, once May conferences passes then pieces drop in, and then later this year

No pro-SM person seems to understand that a theory is an unproven wishy washy words until empiracally tested. If you ask Peter et al, 

you ""Is SM a theory, or a scientific fact that has been empirical tested?""

Bcash has fixed nothing in regard to doublespend risk. Pay enough in fees in btc and dont accept rbf and its fundamentally the same. You can argue that fees are lower, sure, but 0-conf is exactly the same (except you also have to deal with XT nodes relaying everything on bcash).",1522610390

You do realize that as of right now, Chinese scam coin can perform just-as-fast transactions (even micro-transactions) with sub-cent fees on chain, when compared to LN. Also, with LN you cannot gift someone with cryptocurrency who has yet to adopt the technology.

Also with LN, the majority of fees will be removed from the miners and into LN, this is detrimental to the very foundation of the protocol.

"To your first paragraph, yes pretty much. I think you're underestimating the poor user-experience of having to wait a week to get access to your own funds and having to do an expensive onchain transaction to close the channel because you were being censored. Additionally this censorship problem becomes even worse if as many on this subreddit have theorised the lightning network will assume a hub and spoke topology where a relatively small number of liquidity providers can censor your LN transactions.

To your second paragraph, no I don't think so. With Bitcoin you have to ""trust"" the person you're paying to deliver to you whatever goods you bought. With LN you have to do that as well, but you also have to trust n people along a path to your destination to not censor your transactions lest you have to deal with the inconvenience of closing a channel and opening a new one. 

Additionally, with on-chain Bitcoin you can set it up in a trustless escrow that gives you the option of sending your Bitcoin (upon receiving the goods) but no option of ever retrieving the Bitcoin. Thus to punish a bad actor you could never send the Bitcoin to him, and you would only be motivated to do this if he did you a disservice in some way as you could not ever get the funds back yourself.

It is possible that people will keep losing faith and interest in bitcoin, no use case, simply not usable for what it was intended.

I am entitled to have an opinion, just like you, its a free world, but you call me a tool for having a different opinion than you. 

I tell you why people like me dont like BCH and dont want to support the coin by holding or buying it. Its purely because of people like Roger Ver and fake satoshi. (ex) criminals, proven liars, paying people to shill, faking newbies into believing that BCH is bitcoin etc by abusing the bitcoin.com domain, a btc subreddit and the bitcoin twitter. I am not making this up, these are facts.

Also this sub, so toxic. You guys want bitcoin to die, why would you think that anyone who likes bitcoin would support you guys? Why do you think you can win love and support by doing all those things? How did you ever think this would play out?

The truth is that bch probably will never succeed because of these reasons, we, the **majority** in the cryptocommunity, dislike bch because of this. You dont have to like it, I just want to inform you why people are hostile against bch, its because you are hostile to anyone else who doesn't favor bigger blocks, more centralization, less security etc.

You are entitled on having an opinion about what you think is bitcoin, again its a free world, but I am not a tool for disliking it, I even explain to you why I dislike it. 


Bitcoin does not has such dominant frontmen as BCH, of course there is core, most guys are very cool, some a bit less. Of course there are people like Andreas Antonopoulos who are the face of bitcoin. But its been a while now, most people have choosen what they like most, and you guys just ruined it for people like me who had an interest in both coins, but now only hold the real bitcoin because of people like Roger Ver, fake satoshi, and people like you.

"If price drops enough, miners will turn off their rigs when it's cheaper to buy BTC then to pay for the electricity to mine.

If the total hash rate goes down, then the next time the hash difficulty is automatically calculated, it will go down, making it easier (and cheaper) to mine, and miners will turn their rigs back on when it makes sense.

Note that the mining hash difficulty is adjusted every two weeks based on the total hash rate of the network. The calculation is built into the core bitcoin node software. The goal is to keep block generation time to 10 minutes. As a by product, the hash difficulty affects the cost of mining, and the incentive to add or remove mining equipment.

If you don't know how mining works: each node is gathering transactions together to make the next block. They need to create a hash (an encrypted string of 256 numbers) of the block, which requires using a nonce (a string of random numbers with an encryption algorithm). Whichever node that next finds a hash that is below a certain number gets to be the next block in the blockchain. The only way to search for the winning hash is to try running different nonces (running the package of verified transactions with a nonce through the encryption algorithm). The hash has to start with something like 8 zeroes... So it takes many billions of tries to find a hash. Target hash (how small or smaller it needs to be) is recalculated every two weeks.

It's possible I'm making some minor errors (ha ha, get it?), anybody feel free to correct!",1522608279

Example: If you need to liquidate positions on alts to exit in BTC (for any reason), you can generally destroy a valuation with as little as 5 BTC. (Even less sometimes).  The book/mcap ratio is extremely low for most projects.
**Books are too thin**. Maybe we have too many projects too.


An alt like XLM with enough liquidity can be decoupled.. ETH, LTC are for instance. It is just the beginning: there will be more in the near future (Binance working on fiat pairs).

The beauty of fiat pairings is that, with the proper regulation framework, make enter new actors and increase liquidity for legit projects.

- When Bitcoin increases in price compared to USD and, as a result, other cryptocurrencies increase in price as well, no one complains. These posts somehow only appear when the market goes down and people look for a scapegoat.
- Maybe the prices are less coupled to Bitcoin than you think but the market sentiment for cryptocurrencies as a whole is simply negative right now. This is a young and relatively small market. Many coins are trying to achieve exactly the same thing. I'm not surprised when things mostly go up and down as a whole. 
- Even if prices are strongly coupled to Bitcoin, is it really that strange? Half of the cryptocurrencies out there are simply clones of Bitcoin backed by a not-so-impressive development team. There's Ethereum and other ""smart contract"" platforms but I've yet to see one convincing example of a smart contract that indeed requires ""Turing completeness"". Not to mention the fact that like every other smart contract out there seems to contain vulnerabilities. Proof of Work burns a lot of energy, maybe too much, I don't know. But we've yet to see if a version of Proof of Stake can be offer the same kind of security. A system backing a global decentralised currency cannot afford to be 99.99% secure: it needs 100%.

For the alt community to decouple we need more fiat pairings which has been happening as of late. More trade pairings between cryptos. We already see quite a few for ETH but we need that to expand between other top 10/20 cryptos. More Decentralized exchanges and more people using them. Those DEX's need BETTER CHARTS so people will use them more frequently. as a one stop shop.  What USERS can do today is pretty much not use BTC as a trading pair and use another major crypto like ETH. When BTC is dethroned that is when the decoupling will occur IMO.,1522605791

&gt;Segregated witness therefore takes advantage of this opportunity to raise the block size limit to nearly 4 MB, and adds a new cost limit to ensure blocks remain balanced in their resource use (this effectively results in an effective limit closer to 1.6 to 2 MB).

There is nothing making smaller tx more safe. They may carry less risk for each tx (lose less money pr tx), but in the end what matters is how bit a percentage of 0-conf that can be double spent. Its pretty simple actually - if theres a 1% chance of double spend being successful a merchant stands to lose 1% of the 0-conf tx they recieve (assuming everybody are assholes ofc).

Part of that is due to the ICO craze creating way larger marketcaps than the organically grown coins before.

You should research how the ponzis worked.

"&gt;Oh yes, it is. Any asset that involves risk and frequently requires monitoring is gambling. 

No, it really isnt. By your definition, all investments (index based or not) are gambling. You can redefine the term to fit your views all you like. It won't make you any more correct.

&gt;""the house"" for bitcoin are exchanges that proved to be highly corrupt in the past, whales that have no end to greed, miners that can easily twist developer's hands.

You're patently wrong. Exchanges, whales and miners have no control of my bitcoin whatsoever.

&gt; ""the house"" for fiat is the government, banks. 

Still not correct. You clearly find it hard to accept that you are in control of your financial situation - no one else.

&gt;Who would you rather have control your life and savings?

Neither. I control my keys ergo I have ultimate control of my funds. Who has ultimate control of yours?

&gt;I'm not saying crypto has no use, or that it won't be beneficial, on the contrary, i think it's a cool new thing to poke around, but i dislike baseless propaganda ideas like ""bitcoin is the future of money"" or ""bitcoin will solve all our problems"" similar to top post.

But bitcoin *is* the future of money you just have your head buried too deep in the sand to see it.

"Crypto will never be a form of currency. That‚Äôs quite obvious. Some things need to be centralised I think the current payment services will be hard to beat. Transactions are quick, can be insured and most of all they are reliable and can be reversed if trust is broken. Pretty hard to beat that as a payment service.

Bitcoin shouldn‚Äôt be considered an investment either.  It should only be a place to store your wealth temporarily (short or medium term), It won‚Äôt degrade or devalue over time like cash, you can store it easily, and the fact you can access all your wealth easily with just a pass phrase or code still amazes me to this day.

Bitcoin will end up being the perfect true value asset because it will not devalue based on a sudden change in a country‚Äôs economic status. I believe it will be the best assets for families to store their wealth, especially in countries exploited by the west or controlled by corrupt governments. ",1522604229

"The crash back then was waaaay longer, but it was also off the heels of a 100x year for bitcoin, not the 16x or whatever we had this year. And the bubble popped after a 1-month 10x, not the 3 months 6x we experienced. This boom was much slower, but crashed much faster. 2014 crash took 16 months so or to reach the trough of -85% returns. We're at -75% for alt coins already, which is probably the best thing to compare to 2014. Keep in mind, the difference between -85% and -75% is another -40%. 

The lesson i learned was disappearing was a huge mistake. I lost a lot of experience, and I missed opportunities like Etheruem, which I ended up getting at $4 instead of the $0.18 I could have done. The same is true for other great projects that showed up at what was pretty much the absolutely trough of the market. So the morale is, stop being scared, just accept it, and keep paying attention, learning, investing, and building (Yes, contribute more than money). ",1522604069

"I still think it's a scam, but from what you've posted, it's possible that Oleg and Calvin are *not* the same person. The likelihood of Oleg being an employee of Halong is high though, he has been extremely active in their Telegram, always defending Halong, and even putting out what appears to be [strange Russian fake news](https://twitter.com/oleg15891/status/979632660858449920), which has been immediately retweeted by Halong.

At first I thought the scam would play out with just not delivering the Bitcoin miners, but clearly *something* is being delivered. Though from reports we're getting from users, [both on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMining/comments/88g0a8/dragonmint_some_figures_from_people_running_it/), and [on the forum](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2443327.msg33624221#msg33624221), the efficiency gains are not consistent with what one would expect with use of overt ASICBOOST (casting doubts on whether these chips even have the boost in the silicon). People are already getting suspicious at why this hardware is not meeting the specification.

There are also [strange similarities with Innosilicon](https://twitter.com/CobraBitcoin/status/979511767389933569), the PCB is basically an Inno design, a PCB designer [actually confirmed this](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2443327.msg33605564#msg33605564). What's really interesting is a user on the forum a few months ago claimed to have flown to Innosilicon offices, and met with them, [where they told him that the product Halong has obtained is actually theirs](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2443327.msg29744426#msg29744426), and simply one of their future products. Obviously you can't take the word of random people on the internet on faith, but since there *are* striking similarities both in the PCB, and in the [Web UI](https://i.imgur.com/KzC3RoP.png), it's more likely that this is actually an Innosilicon product.

Personally I think they have stolen them somehow, since theft is the most logical conclusion here. If Innosilicon wanted to compete with BITMAIN in secret (which makes *no* sense, since they already compete anyway), they have the expertise available to do a better job covering that up. It's also not unimaginable for Inno to release a BTC miner, since they have miners for LTC &amp; Dash, they could easily have been planning an entry into the BTC mining hardware game this year.

That's what I think has happened with respect to the Dragonmint T1's (the Bitcoin miners), I think they're just stolen, but we'll have to see in the coming weeks how Inno will respond. They could distance themselves from the whole thing to save face, or they could aggressively demand that all customers of Halong return the miners to Inno, along with all earnings. Who knows. Either way, you really don't want to be making money out of what could be stolen goods.

Now with the miners for other algorithms, this is where it gets really evil and horrible. For example with their blake2b miner, [they're claiming efficiency levels of 3.83 TH/s @ 1380W](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Co6mNBc_yjU), while the best BITMAIN hardware for that same algorithm, [the Antminer A3](https://shop.bitmain.com/product/detail?pid=00020180116164357365a2ljX8gx06D3), is only doing 815 GH/s @ 1275W. Those claims are absurd, and it makes me doubt whether this hardware actually exists. There is absolutely no way an unknown company is able to beat BITMAIN hardware to that extent, considering BITMAIN's massive R&amp;D capability and engineering talent. Conveniently, they haven't shipped out those miners, and there have been consistent delays, with customers still waiting.

Once this all blows over in the next few weeks, I think it's going to be ***the*** biggest scam in Bitcoin. And we should not forget the main people who promoted this nonsense to thousands. The best way to decentralize mining is with a PoW change, not by getting Halonged with some shady hardware and fictitious companies promoted by Adam Back.",1522604050
"Okay, then technically this is second worse dip in Crypto. This is the worse one I've experienced.

"Now I'm starting to think you're actually stupid. Like not all that smart.

&amp;nbsp;

Of course I don't know that every single node is real. That's not what is the issue here. The issue is understanding if running a full node as a REAL user is useful or not. So... we ASSUME we have 10,000 REAL full nodes. Do these have any impact on the network or not? I have extensively shown that it does, because every node enforces the consensus rules so miners cannot cheat. 

Again, we need to understand **if** running an economic full node is useful or not **IN PRINCIPLE**. The *assumption* here is that the nodes are NOT VM nodes, but real users.

And the answer is yes, a most resounding yes. If you are economically active, and if you can afford it, you should run your own full node because it strengthens the network and makes you your own bank.


&amp;nbsp;

The question is one of hypotheticals and game theory. It does not mean every node is real. But by showing the usefulness of a REAL ECONOMIC FULL NODE, I can convince REAL USERS to run one. Luckily running a node doesn't cost all that much, a RasPi3 + old HDD will do the job, so many people can actually do it. 

And guess what? More and more people are doing it. 

Have a look [here](https://coin.dance/nodes) and check out the growth of Bitcoin Core nodes. This is, with a very high degree of confidence, organic growth of real economic nodes. Compare this with the *btc1* node count... and see how they increased dramatically leading up to early November 2017, which is when S2X was scheduled for. After it got called off, all those nodes dropped off just as fast as they popped up. Those are fake nodes, which is why they did not serve any good to S2X. This proves your point, fake nodes are useless. But REAL users, with REAL nodes, most of them anyway, insisted on running their Core nodes, and others compatible with the same consensus rules. This is real economic activity which thwarted S2X/NYA. I was proudly one of them.

"Tiger woods to golf is the same as bitcoin is to crypto

**Evidence**
*Golf ratings and the prize money of other golfers are reliant on tiger woods as are cryptocurrency and altcoins reliant on bitcoin
*They have both gone through a highly publicized split. Elin Nordegrens split with woods and bitcoin cash split with bitcoin
*Multiple back surgeries, knee surgeries, scandals later and tiger is still relevant. The same can be said for bitcoin. After all the fud, controversies, regulation and so on btc is still king.

Therefore, tiger woods doing well in the masters will no doubt have a positive correlation with bitcoin.

"It always baffles me when people feel the ATH value of their alts were completely justified and would have been sustained if it weren't for that pesky BTC losing value.

"For those who don't follow the absurd propaganda war:

Bitcoin Cash reintroduces fast, cheap and safe payments to hundreds of thousands of vendors around the globe.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is one of two relevant bitcoin types from the chain split on aug. 1st. The other is Bitcoin (BTC). Bitcoin Cash is not an altcoin, the chain starts jan 3, 2009, and is the same for Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH), from the genesis block and up to 1.aug 2017, when the split occurred. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is arguably the bitcoin version which is closest to the original bitcoin (which stopped to exist with the inclusion of segwit in the BTC chain). Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is the high capacity, low fee, instant payment version, the only coin with a vision to conquer the world.

Bitcoin cash is non government, free market, sound money for the world, easily transactable, relatively anonymous, hideable, protectable, backupable and teleportable.

I'll personally be following a similar buy strategy, but I'll skip BTC in favor of BCH at $200-$300 each.

"No, that's not how markets work. You're only identifying the **micro** level here, so if we were to draw comparison with the stock market, yes news have a big impact on individual companies (E.g. Token Burn = Company buying back shares, price increases accordingly)

However you are completely ignoring the **macro-level**. It affects the entire market, everyone would be affected irregardless of their current 'news'. Take the recent stock market correction for example - fuelled by trade war concerns, the instability of the Trump administration and a generally overheated market. The entire market fell in a similar fashion.

This is exactly what is happening to the Crypto markets. Macro factors such as countries enforcing regulations, Tether controversies hurts the confidence of the entire market. Large caps like BTC and ETH generally lose less compared to most other alt-coins, again similar to the stock market where small caps get crushed harder in downturns compared to large caps.

Fiat pairings have absolutely nothing to do with altcoins getting destroyed in this bear market. They get destroyed because they are perceived as even riskier and more unlikely to survive than Bitcoin, which has large brand recognition, adoption and first-mover advantage.",1522603620

"I got involved with Bitcoin Core (Its anyone can join) and I made it clear that Im not skilled in coding but did list why Im interested and asked is there a place for me here? Is there a way I can contribute? 

That day I got a lot of really plostive replies from people welcoming me and explaining what I can do to add value. Things from translation to using the the latest wallet and(throuh the lens of a non-coder) describing what I thought could be improved on in the software....All kinds of ideas brought up about how someone can contribute who isnt a coder. 

Most of all that experience validated that anyone can join and contribute. It's amazing to realize how many people volunteer and contribute in someway Bitcoin.

That specific experience was with Bitcoin Core, but when I attend a Bitcoin meetup and discuss ideas and the state of Bitcoin, that is not related to Core and I contribute value in diffent ways, one of the bigger ones is by adding to the network effect. Bitcoin doesnt have an advertising budget so simply by learning about Bitcoin and discussing it critically and sharing what works and making contacts to help me see through FUD, helps the network effect. The proof is that we have seen totally new people come to our meetup in Montreal. People who dont fit the demographic at all, females over 40 have come and now they have met people who they can ask for guidance and they have told others about Bitcoin. The list of gifts from meetups keeps growing, everyone who didnt know how safely claim more obscure hard forks, is one of the big gifts (once you build some trust) also people meet members who have a larger amount of Bitcoin who are willing to sell it at a price that beats Local Bitcoins. I personally always want to meet anyone running a node, because Im learning that online bots or trolls create the false impression of community depth. So in person Ive only met people running a Bitcoin node never once a node for a fork of Bitcoin node. We also track other metrics like the amount of new Bitcoin ATMS in town and other leading and coincidental indicators

Anyone getting involved with the community is so worth it, both personally and for the entire ecosystem.

"if i were to tell you definitely sell when (if) we see 25k, then most likely that would not end up being the ceiling.  sell whenever you will be able to realize profits that seem worthwhile to you, unless circumstances make it necessary to sell sooner.  i was forced to sell 6 btc at $1200 per coin a year ago, and i got to see it move to $3000 a month or two later.  with 20/20 hindsight i would have made alternative payment arrangements and come out way ahead.  obviously i would have onlys old one coin and held the other 5, and then sold at the exact peak in december.  /s 

if you expect btc to hit 100k then dont sell at 25k and dont be sad when it crashes again before getting there.  it goes without saying that there are no guarantees of any future performance here.  its possible that btc can become entirely devalued, but we are using a proven hash function for security and the liklihood is rather slim.  if future hpc clusters start to come knocking, the hashing would be changed.  if the underlying crypto is somehow broken where keys are reversed and raided wholesale then the security of the internet as a whole has failed and the value of 1btc is no longer a top concern (which is ""good"" since it would be devalued).  thankfully most people who are of the defacement persuasion rather than the profit mindset are not skilled enough to be able to begin to contemplate reversing a hash function which was purpose-built to not be reversible via quick and dirty cheats.  def never underestimate the right ninja strike force, but do take some comfort in knowing that they would want btc to be worth as much money as possible if they spent the ridiculous amount of time and development resources to be able to move it at will.",1522602557
"How can we even be on this chart when neither institutional nor public has truly been involved yet? I'd say the true bubble hasn't happened yet. Eventually we will enter into the trillions in market cap, crypto is an emerging market. I'd say you'd be a fool if you bought recently at ATH's but you'd be an even bigger fool if you sold at these recent lows. If you considered it a good investment in December well you should be averaging down and adding to your positions at these prices and new lows going forward. 

These cryptos are flush with cash and have a seriously crazy technology to work with. Give them time and we will see in the coming years where this ship can take us. Once these cryptos get the ball rolling and start putting things to use it will usher in the next boom. Institutional money will start flowing once these companies flush with cash start displaying their product, they'll drive the prices up and then the public who always come late to the party will push it even further, then we can start posting this chart.",1522602534

"&gt;It doesn't makes sense to refute someone because we're of a different school of thought, but this doesn't necessarily mean I have to accept his.

This makes absolutely no sense. What is the point of research and analysis if not to communicate ideas to others? You are saying there is never a right answer and all analyses live in some kind of economic relativism? What is the point of doing the analysis in the first place then?

I don't understand how you think it is more valuable to make condescending snarky replies than to just directly state whatever evidence you hold that leads you to believe a contrary opinion.

I'm not interested in Buffet blasting bitcoin because he didn't do any research or analysis on it, and said that he did not understand it, and has repeatedly been wrong about technology investments.

Kraken has several alts with multiple fiat pairings. It may not be at Binance's level, but Kraken consistently does nine digits worth of trading volume. There's liquidity to be had, but fiat pairings there aren't doing anything to ""save"" the price of alts.

I think people need to come to grips with the reality that even if Binance comes out with fiat pairs for multiple alts, and exchanges slowly phase out Tether, the market will still be moved overall by the price of BTC. ""Fiat up"" will simply become the new version of Tethering.",1522602100

"&gt; An asset that highly fluctuates in value is called gambling.
This is incorrect. ""Fluctuates in value"" is what all assets do. Saying that an asset is ""volatile"" or ""more volatile"" than another asset is incorrect unless you take into consideration risk-adjusted returns. You're looking at volatility in a vacuum and that is incorrect. There's no magic volatility number that makes buying one asset investing and another gambling. You need to take into consideration risk relative to return for it to make sense.

And regarding your comment that some assets require more monitoring than others, that is also incorrect. ALL assets require monitoring, stocks, bonds, commodities, Forex, crypto, etc. Now, if someone risks more than is prudent in an asset class in an ""Lambo to the Moon"" attempt, then that is pretty much gambling. But note that it's not the asset class that makes it gambling. It's the over-leveraging that equates it to blind speculation.

I thought that too until the cost/amount of electricity to mine Bitcoin went through the roof.  Bitcoin is the Model -T of the day and something will replace it that has a very low tx fee verifies a tx in seconds.  One problem most of the cryptos have today is processing the blockchain.  There is a lot of data to store the whole blockchain and what will the size of the blockchain look like in 10 years if Bitcoin starts being used like Visa cards are used today.

There is a AltCoin Manipulation, going on.

You buy BTC for $10,000, you now own BTC. 

They create Alts, and manipulate r/Crypto with bogus Altcoins, or bots to upvote posts, 


You then sell your BTC, in order buy their Alts coins 

They now have got your BTC and can hoard it as much as they can

They do this via creating fake companies and sites, using bots to up vote posts, etc



WS wont make BTC go to 5k


There has been more and more news lately and reports, of how people think BTC will go to around 5k. I suspect WS is behind this, hence many people are waiting on the side, looking to buy at 5k. Wall Street are not stupid, and will manipulate anything to make more money, I think BTC will touch 6/5,5k and then move sideways, then pump to 7k and stabilize, those people left waiting for a 5k BTC, will then FOMO back in either 7k or 8k 



Volume is also manipulated by Bots 


- Some people think that currently BTC volume of 4bn is $4bn coming in and out, when in reality, If I buy 1 BTC, that is 1 volume, if i  then sell 0.01 BTC than is 2 volume, now if I keep buying and selling that 0.01 BTC again and again and again and again, no new fiat is coming in or out but volume is being created.

"The Dvorak comparison is a good point. The difference it's not simply a matter of efficiency. Bitcoin lacks a lot of the functionality that will make blockchains useful. It would be like if Qwerty didn't have numbers, caps lock, or a return key, and the 't' gets stuck when you've been using it all day.

Bitcoin is a currency. Blockchain is a platform. 

On blockchain platform has a **huge** first mover advantage. If you look at the top 100 coins by market cap, *47* of them are on the Ethereum blockchain. In the end, maybe another chain will take over, but it won't, it *can't* be bitcoin. Bitcoin simply doesn't have that functionality.

On other fronts, if you want privacy, you can look into Monero, which is basically a more decentralized, much less traceable bitcoin. (This is what is actually used to buy things in black markets, where people formerly used bitcoin). Also this is the one to buy if you're an idealist.

If you want financial adoption, go with Ripple, if you want speed go with maybe NANO? (I haven't actually done my research on this one yet, but there are lots of options that are faster than BTC)

If you want infinite scaleability, many chains have better scaling potential than bitcoin. [Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/chart/tx) for example consistently processes more transactions than [bitcoin](https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions) already, and with a much smaller fee. If you are risk-tolerant, there are also a lot of longshots which promise better (or even infinite) scaling right around the corner.

"&gt; [BitPay etc] let merchants deal with Bitcoin

No, they don't.  The merchants do not handle the bitcoin in any way, and don't even know what the price is in bitcoin.

When you click ""pay with Bitcoin"" on a merchant's site, your browser is redirected to the BitPay server.  BitPay converts the item's price from USD (as specified by the merchant) to BTC, at its chosen rate, and displays it to you.  You send the bitcoins to Bitpay (not to the merchant).  BitPay then sends USD to the merchant by bank transfer. 

So BitPay is just a convenient way to sell your bitcoins and use the USD to pay on-line merchants.  A merchant who subscribes to BitPay and agrees to put up a ""Bitcoin Accepted"" sign is not really accepting bitcoin. He is just subscribing to another USD payment processor.

I can buy stuff from Dell in the US with my credit card and settle the bill here in Brazil with BRL.   What happens is that Visa and its member banks send USD to Dell USA and take my BRL in return,  It would be silly to say that ""Dell USA accepts BRL"" just because I can do that.",1522599271
"Excerpt: The niche of centralized exchanges comes from blending the functions of a stock market and a bank. A centralized exchange is a marketplace for trading or converting assets through a single location or service. In many ways, it is similar to the New York Stock Exchange. Currencies can be traded and shorted, for example; margin trading, stop loss, and lending are also available. Satoshi did not address the stock-market functions of crypto, which he probably did not foresee. In fairness, Satoshi explicitly referred to Bitcoin as a developing and evolving technology, which was in its infancy.

In other ways, centralized exchanges resemble banks. After purchasing crypto from an exchange, many customers choose to leave their coins in an account rather than transfer them to a private wallet on their own hard drive. The reasons vary: convenience, the comforting similarity to a bank, the ease of converting to fiat, quick trading, and discomfort with the technology required to set up a private wallet. Whatever the reason, centralized exchanges become trusted third parties that endanger the wealth and well-being of individuals. Consider one aspect of the problem. Private keys are the crypto. The coins have no physical presence, only algorithmic ones. When an exchange controls the keys, it owns the coins; the customer has nothing more than a promise of access to them upon demand.

Reality often breaks promises. ",1522599269
"Well firstly, I just concede that there are only maybe a handful of people alive with the actual knowledge and expertise necessary to really debate proof-of-work vs proof-of-stake - and I am not one of them. 

But from my humble perspective, the biggest problem with proof of stake is its practically untested security model. Just a few issues I see: 

1) Proof of stake makes it very cheap to create alternate versions of the ledger. This means it is cheap to attack the network with various strategies. Vitalik‚Äôs proposed solution to this is to destroy the bonded security of the attacker. This works in theory, but here‚Äôs my catch: the economic punishment is essentially moot if it (the punishment itself) can merely be forked away. A proof-of-work system ensures that any economic punishment comes in the form of lost work. This means valuable time, electricity, compute cycles, warehouse space, etc - that can‚Äôt be regained with a simple change of a ledger. 

2) What happens if a bad actor is able to trick enough honest actors into his network, so it becomes in their best interest support the bad actors attacking chain as the real chain. Granted, this would be a very expensive attack if successful - perhaps not even worth doing. 

Neither of these things break proof-of-stake as a solution for me - it‚Äôs just that I would like to see them fleshed out in a project I didn‚Äôt have so much personally invested in. 

I think that PoS probably has a place in the future of crypto. It‚Äôs efficiency over PoW is undeniable (at least in my eyes). ",1522599259

The lack of this kind of trust is the biggest problem crypto is facing right now. So we should aim at mass adoption. Mass adoption means we should give the masses something about crypto which everybody on earth can use. And what does everybody on earth use? It's money in one form or another.

"**Proof of impossibility**

A proof of impossibility, also known as negative proof, proof of an impossibility theorem, or negative result, is a proof demonstrating that a particular problem cannot be solved, or cannot be solved in general. Often proofs of impossibility have put to rest decades or centuries of work attempting to find a solution. To prove that something is impossible is usually much harder than the opposite task; it is necessary to develop a theory. Impossibility theorems are usually expressible as universal propositions in logic (see universal quantification).

I thought this was a really good concept that addresses some of the core problems being faced in crypto right now. 

The Bitcoin ecosystem is toxic, unsustainable, and not actually very decentralized. It was a good concept at first, but now it's monopolized by big players like Bitmain. The absurd amount of resources going into mining for the sake of ""securing the network"" is ridiculous. All that just to accomplish 7 tps. Like any ecosystem, Bitcoin only grows if the money funneling in is greater than the money coming out. But the fact of the matter is that almost NO-ONE is actually using it in the way it was intended. Even businesses that accept it are only using it as a medium to sell back into fiat. Ignore the Mt. Gox trustee cashing out $400MM, that was nothing because remember that these miners and Bitmain are cashing out BILLIONS on a yearly basis to pay for their operations. Even the miners are NOT holding all their mined BTCs. This is a constant monetary drain on the ecosystem that makes no sense at all. 

If blockchain technology and the rest of the cryptospace is to succeed, it NEEDS to get away from Bitcoin. Let the devs and miners fight amongst themselves with their politics, but we cannot be letting Bitcoin destroy the progress that has been made elsewhere because this is screwing over not only the average investor, but other promising projects in blockchain that have so much more potential beyond just as a decentralized currency.",1522598816

actual inflow of dollars when btc was at $500 billion was calculated to be $10-12 billion by JP Morgan. I would see it as an actual crash when cryptos are over several trillion dollars.

"All markets are undergoing a shift.  Lots of talk of a stealth bear market in stocks.  I think once there is upward movement in the S&amp;P, then we will see crypto coming back too.  My general guess is summer is the time we might start to see real recovery.  But if we are really entering into a recession, then this could be a full year.  There were some localized downturns in the US (shale oil over expanded), we haven't really had a downturn in a while.",1522598674

The point being as time goes on and as the market doesn't return any gains, it makes it harder and harder to just hold some token that you were hoping would go up 100% and that you could flip for more.

The dollar was not all that stable when it was backed by gold.  If Bitcoin had replaced the dollar last year a lot of people would have been unhappy seeing their net worth go from $20k to almost $6K.  I know if it was the world currency it would only change a little in value each year like the dollar and other big currencies do today.   Bitcoin is suppose to be like gold but I have seen gold down at $300 and now at $1300.  Why has the dollar value lost that much or were people just not interested in gold at $300.  ,1522598485

""VeChain is building the world's first blockchain powered exchange that can handle physical goods and RMB both digitally and in person. Our implemented work with D.I.G. has enabled us to begin this platform with fine wine/liquor"".

"It's ok to couple BTC with crypto...if it was stable. Let's assume 1 bitcoin =$1000. You buy an alt with your whole bitcoin. When bitcoin goes down, an alt can go down. So if your alt goes down 5 percent. That's .95 satoshi remaining. Now what if bitcoin goes down 5 percent the same day? Now looking at your portfolio, you didn't lose just 5%, you just lost almost 10%! .95 satoshi X 950 = $902.50.  This is if both are down that day, which has happened. But of course is not always the case.

However, if the pairings are as stable as a currency, where fluctuation in value is minimal, then the value of an alt can grow more healthily and not based on something so volatile.  ",1522598423

But for sake of argument, if it was, they‚Äôd make bank because they get the fees from 1000 transactions. As a miner I‚Äôd welcome high fees as long as the blocks were full.

"It will all depend on who gets elected in 2018 and 2020.  If the politicians can't see the way to balance the budget and even reduce the debt we are in real trouble.  We are going to have a serious downturn if for no other reason then it has been a long time since 2008 and 2009 and the economy goes through cycles.  The corporate debt is also starting to be a major problem.  

The problem I see with Bitcoin is like the Ford Model T it will be replaced by a newer better model of coin.  The other big problem is taxes are hurting the use of Bitcoin.  When you use the dollar you don't have to keep track of anything you buy except investments.  With Bitcoin or any crypto you have to keep a record of every move for tax purposes.  ",1522597124
"As a Bitcoin Cash supporter I would give my business to a company whose CEO calls it ""bcash"" because he hates it.",1522597100
"I am one of the lucky few who bought in early just because I had a ""feeling"" it was gonna be a thing. I ended up with 6.5 BTC 5 years ago after a $1200 investment. As you can tell I was more than ecstatic at how it turned out last year. 

After BTC sored to its dizzing height I sold 2 at 20k and ended up investing the rest into other coins. I've cashed out 70k total but my opportunity cost was a whopping 100k that I never actualized cause of my insufferable greed. That's a hard pill to swallow for me even though my initial investment was so small. I have perhaps put in an additional 15-20k at various points in the last few months since November so I certainly am a long-term investor/buyer and I would say my total actualized profits is around 50k. My portfolio has been fluctuating between 50-60k now so while that's decent it's still down and looks to be in the Red except for a few (bought RaiBlocks (RIP) at $1), so it's all over the place. 

I would say I am both and intend to hold on to specific coins for a long time. The problem is that no one even knows what Cryptocurrency is even going to do and how much it will gain traction and adoption. I imagine coins offering some kind of protocol will be far more capable of establishing an economy that sees their value rise. 

What has made me realize the potential for Crypto however is how efficient and cost effective it is at creating an asset to be purchased. If you want to invest in an ETF or Index you need to have an account with a bank and be approved for an investing account, and if someone who wants to set up an ETF it takes months to do and costs millions in the process. The same sort of asset can be created in a day with a fraction of the cost as a coin; and you own it entirely with no bank affiliation. 

Thia technology is going to change our economy fundamentally and establish smaller, more personally integrated communal economies. That alone should be a good enough reason to invest. ",1522597080
"Couldn't agree more.  Whether or not you believe the conspiracy theories of Bitcoin's price manipulation by the cartel or whatever, there IS some shady shit going on and most of us are just taking stabs at the reason.  For cryptocurrency to thrive we have to decouple the link to Bitcoin.  I think the key here is Binance.  The largest volume crypto exchange in the world offering FIAT pairs is going to be a massive game changer.  This will allow great projects to find their real value without the Bitcoin ball and chain.  Kudos to CZ for having the balls to move wherever in the world he needs to, to make this happen.

"hey, you've gt a point but you're missing the main thread of knowledge here when it comes to bitcoin. You may want to check out a YouTube video but I'll lay it out here too... when it comes to USD, or GBP, or whatever ""fiat"" or ""normal money"" thee is always a middle man involved with every transaction. With USD or any other fiat, that is a central bank, backed by the US government. Those banks and governments control that currency. With every transaction, the bank gets a cut and then they write this down on their internal, central ledger that you paid Mr. ABC $X.  With Bitcoin, there is no middleman. No one owns or controls it.  The ledger is not private and susceptible to manipulation.  The ledger is distributed among thousands of computers so everyone can see what's going on. So, the value of bitcoin is controlled by those who own it, not any single government or bank. If we as a people decide that bitcoin has value, and we start using it to buy goods and services, then it's value goes up. We are now in the phase where a lot of people thought that was a great idea; however, the idea had not yet shown real world potential. So, the speculation of how great it can be was more than the adoption and usage of the product.  Many people, myself included, still believe in the future of the product of bitcoin as a currency and storage of wealth/value.  The next phase will be actually using bitcoin which has already started. It has started in large markets.  For example, you can buy a $250,000 car using bitcoin or a flat in London. You can't yet buy a candy bar though at your local 7-Eleven, but when that time comes, we will all own some amount of bitcoin, and it's value will be sky high.  So to make it easier to use as a currency, we have started using Lightning Network, Segwit, and the cost of trading Bitcoin and using it is coming down tremendously. If you think the future of commerce over the internet or even between individuals is using a credit card or writing checks, then I think you're shortsighted. Eventually there will be a globally-recognized, singular currency. Is it Bitcoin?  Who konws, but that's looking more likely.  It is looking less likely that some singular country's currency (US) will be that currency. This wonp't happen overnight, but if you believe that it will happen eventually, then you can invest now in that idea by buying bitcoin to hold into the future.  Just buy enough that you're willing to gamble though since the future has yet to be written. ",1522596740
"But do men or woman invest more USD? Do me. Or women spend more USD? The answer is probably men, the ladder question maybe closer margins. 
I really hate things like this why would gender have anything to do with investment decisions? Especially something like bitcoin. I‚Äôm currently taking a finance class that is covering the stock market, the class I am in has around 7 males to about 15 females. The class HIGHLY ENCOURAGES YOU TO TAKE RISKY VENTURES with a small part of your portfolio however the class only teaches you about buying bonds and stocks. Bitcoin is not included and the small mentions by my prof here and there are mostly examples of volatility. The point I‚Äôm making is if bitcoin isn‚Äôt being taught as a mainstream investment opportunity in the general business courses. Yes they are starting to add specific classes but even still the only way one will obtain bitcoin is by choosing with there own freewill to invest time and money into it. No one can make you buy it, so whoever owns it, owns it. That‚Äôs just based on my own life experiences anyways. ",1522596735

News about crypto is rather bearish and in fact it seems unlikely that any existing cryptocurrency will be used by any government. Governments and banks will surely issue their own cryptocurrency. When regarding blockchain how ever it is a different scene. Blockchain news has been positive mostly. A Project like EOS , for example has the most chance of surviving this crash and actually rising from the dead. Blockchain infrastructures are taking it up against other big tech companies, but the incentive for these big existing companies which is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù competition. No government or bank can ban blockchain. So in my head i  think that investing in blockchain companies is a more logical choice, rather then investing in cryptocurrencies.

If you are rational, and you have two currencies to choose from, being USD/EUR vs BTC, how do you convince someone to choose the more volatile and unpredictable method? Sure it could go to zero in theory but it could also explode back to $10k USD equivalent. Would you willingly take that gamble in order to justify spending it?

Source: Used Bitcoin last year to buy gift cards. I sorta regret that now seeing as how the value has increased much beyond January 2017 prices.

It is incorrect.

This is also false.  Blockstreams is one of many entities contributing to core.  There is a long list of dozens and dozens of contributors in every release of core, most of which are unaffiliated with Blockstream.  Same applies to dev mailing list discussions, etc.

&gt; and there is a (more anonymous) LN dev team, managed officially by this chick Elizabeth xy.

There is no single LN team, there are several.

A couple of our guys are Blockstream are developing some stuff on c-lightning, Elizabeth Stark at Lightning Labs is involved with developing LND.  The third biggest group working on LN is the ACINQ group.  I think Bitfury had their own stuff they were doing as well.  There was that Zap wallet being developed, too.",1522595304

Just a paper wallet is enough to HODL.

This will lead the absolute number of node to drop.

&gt; This is an interesting post topic. My impression of the core roadmap is pretty much the same as yours, that they are trying to squeeze infinitesimally small throughput improvements out of overly complicated changes that require large changes in user behaviour to be particularly effective.

This is one of the more reasonable skeptical perspectives I've seen here.  I do think that a lot is going to need to change in order for the stuff being worked on now to be truly effective, but I think that holds true for any scaling map.  I'm cautiously optimistic that LN can be improved to the point where it is useful enough that people are indeed happy to use it quite frequently, which can synergize with lots of the other scaling strategies being pursued.

&gt; E.g. Schnorr's reliance on heavy multisig usage.

I don't believe this is necessarily true.  To my knowledge (not 100% sure about this, but open to being corrected), signature aggregation could also function across multiple inputs and outputs in the same transaction.

This means that if coinjoin becomes more prominently used (very likely if we get a non-interactive version working with Confidential Transactions), then there could be significant advantages for Schnorr's sigagg there.

&gt; It's basically the Segwit strategy. They learned literally nothing from their failures with Segwit

Why do you think Segwit failed?  As far as I understand it, the main purpose of Segwit was the fix the transaction malleability issue, and pave the way for lightning to develop, and for increase capabilities for softforks in the future.  The first has been happening, and the second is yet to be used.  So it doesn't seem correct to me to describe Segwit as having failed.",1522594962

Now, let‚Äôs imagine ordering some coffee or shake at Starbucks which already has a long line of people waiting. If you don‚Äôt have instantaneous transactions, the cashier has to wait a couple minutes per person to check if the confirmations go through and even then, the business ends up receiving 99% of the cost per individual (assuming 1% fee).

So, currently I think it‚Äôs obvious that the answer is NANO, although not the most popular by market cap, but it‚Äôs doing fairly well. Only problem I can see with mass adoption of NANO is the tps. However, every other ‚Äòcurrency‚Äô coin will probably work on that issue as they are adopted and forced to increase their code to support millions of tps.

Regardless of whether it‚Äôs not as popular as BTC, ETH or IOTA for transactions, when crypto becomes adopted and people realise their options regarding currency coins, they‚Äôre bound to choose fee-less and instant. Whether NANO still holds its ground or is overtaken by another currency which can achieve both qualities is up to the devs. ",1522594696
"Let's be realistic, could this be the drop that ended crypto all together? Like, i know there is a chance but how big would that chance be (estimated)?",1522594683
guys I have a legit question. What happens if we get to the point where it is more expensive to mine a bitcoin than the profit the miners receive? Are we screwed if we get that low?,1522594678
"Two points.

1.	This has nothing to do with the US dollar that the bet is about. The USD may ‚Äúcollapse‚Äù and you can still lose if Bitcoin doesn‚Äôt appreciate sufficiently under your conditions. It‚Äôs silly. 
2.	This is a ‚Äúheads I win, tails you lose‚Äù bet. The further BTC drops, the less your opponent wins in real terms. The higher it goes, the more you win in real terms. It‚Äôs a silly proposition and I find it rather telling that you are not only trying to pussy out of your original statement, but also try being a really mediocre scam artist. 

Come on, real stakes with no bullshit. Real 10,000 Big Macs-pegged currency of choice for you and your opponent. None of this imaginary store of value or fiat nonsense. Delicious calories that you can eat only. ",1522594656
"Blockchain is not crypto. Blockchain is a  technology you can use for anything.
Why would crypto market react positive coz some government decided to choose one technology over other?",1522594642
"Rule #1: As soon as you invest in any crypto, you are now also invested in Bitcoin",1522594619
Bitcoin keeps its status because people convert it.  If more exchanges converted fiat to many coins or  would except lots of other coins to get on the exchange bitcoin would lose some of its standing.  Now that the transaction fees and speed are much better then a few months ago or Bitcoin would be on the way out.  ,1522594605
"I feel like that with how much crypto has disappointed me lately, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see a negative in my portfolio value soon. I‚Äôm used to seeing red now. Is it possible to lose more than you actually invested? I feel like crypto might just let that happen ",1522594577
"Don‚Äôt get caught in the pump when everyone is talking about BTC, etc. Usually, when even your barber is suggesting the imminent rise of an investment, dump that shit until it hits bottom, then rebuy. You‚Äôve successfully (in most cases) lowered your average buy in price *and* increased your quantity. Rinse and repeat. crypto may be new,  but market cycles and trajectories are something we‚Äôre well versed in. ",1522594569

"Zcash is not even 3 years old, with each new block ""inflation"" decreases, and it isn't nearly at the inflation levels of other coins (especially premined coins).
The blockchain by is technological definition an auditable supply log, plus along with the Power of Tau Ceremony these concerns are addressed.
AFAIK there isn't an ASIC for Zcash, so to say it is miner centralized is a straw-man arguement and doesn't make sense when the biggest threat to decentralization is the crowding-out of individual GPU miners for ASICs and big-box Chinese firms. This is why BTC is broken IMO.

FURTHERMORE what is really hilarious is that your PIVX coin literally uses the Zerocoin protocol which was developed by the current zcash team! The coin you like so much is a copy of zcash, just without the devs, and with all the shills and marketing bullshit you see with all the other shitcoins. Just comparing the two official website of zcash and pivx anyone can immediately see that the zcash team and goal is for enhancing the crypto space and it's users privacy, where as pivx looks like any other altcoin copy-cat. Look up Powers of Tau, Overwinter, Sapling, etc and compare to the non-existent development of PIVX. Oh wait, no, I see on the PIVZ site that they have offered the first crypto beer!

"Please know all this about lightning before getting too excited 

Essentially, lightning only works as a scaling solution when everyone is already using it. It has no way to bridge the gap from no users(where it is starting) to everyone worldwide using it.

Worse, it has numerous tradeoffs that will discourage the average person from using it. This amplifies the downsides that arise from it not being universally in use instantly, and will prevent it from ever reaching that state. Here are those:

1. You must be online all the time to be paid. And the person you want to pay must be online for you to pay them.

2. If you go offline at the wrong time and aren't using a centralized hub, you can lose money you didn't even knowingly transact with.

3. The solution to #2 is to enlist ""watchers"" to prevent you from losing money. More overhead the average person isn't going to care about or understand, and more fees that have to be paid. Or people will just be forced to use centralized hubs.

4. Two new users to Lightning will not be able to actually pay eachother without using a centralized hub because no one will lock up funds into the opposing side of their channels; No funded channels = can't pay eachother. Hence... Hubs.

5. Using hubs will come with monthly fee; They aren't going to lock up their capital on your behalf for no cost.

6. The entire system is vulnerable to a mass-default attack. Hubs are especially vulnerable.

7. Lightning will not be able to route large payments(no route available).

8. Lightning transactions are larger than normal transactions.

9. Lightning nodes must keep track of the full history of channel states themselves. If they lose this, they are vulnerable to attacks and may lose coins.

10. Attackers may randomly lock up funds anywhere along the chain of channels for extended periods of time(many hours) at no cost to themselves.

11. The network randomly may fail to work for a user under certain circumstances for no discernable reason as far as they can see (no route available). 


And the issues directly related to the not having everyone on the planet on lightning at first:

1. Small payments consolidating into larger ones, such as a retailer who needs to pay vendors, will fail to route on Lightning, and the loop between the source of the payments(end users) and their destinations(retailers) is broken. This means every channel will ""flow"" in one direction, and need to be refilled to resume actually being used.

2. Refilling every channel will be at least one onchain transaction, possibly two. If this happens twice a month, 1mb blocks + segwit will only be able to serve 4 million users. Some estimates are that Bitcoin already has 2-3 million users.

3. Regardless of lightning's offchain use, Bitcoin must still have enough transaction fees to provide for its network security. Except instead of that minimum fee level being shouldered by 1000 - 500000 million transactions, it is only shouldered by ~170 million transactions with segwit 1mb blocks.
That situation doesn't exist in a vacuum. Users will have a choice - They can go through all that, deal with all of those limitations, odd failures &amp; risks and pay the incredibly high fees for getting on lightning in the first place... Or they can just buy Ethereum, use a SPV wallet, and have payments confirmed in 15 seconds for a fraction of the fees. Or roughly the same choice for SPV+BCH.

The choice will be obvious.

My (and many others) opinion is that lighting is not near as good as people think it will be... It just isn't a scaling solution. Lightning is fine for use cases that need to do frequent, small, or predictable payments with few entities. For example, mining pools paying PPLNS miners. Or gamblers making small bets on gambling sites. Or traders making frequent trades on exchanges.

But as a general purpose scaling solution for average people? It sucks, and they are absolutely not going to go through all of that shit just to use crypto, especially not with better, cheaper, more reliable options out there.",1522593315

It probably wasn't intentional, just misunderstood, but Selfish mining is a **theory**, with **no empirical testing**. The only person who tested it was Craig, and Peter &amp; Emin used character assassinations and smears to silence him last year.

SM is now being used again in the same manner, for some reason some certain lead scientists and others still think bitcoin is a ""mesh network"" (its not).

So, yes, i know the person was trolling you and he is a clueless troll (his history makes him obvious).

Ask peter if Selfish mining is a **theory** or **has it been empirically tested and is scientific fact?** and watch him hand wave and insult you and say some shit like ""who are YOU to talk to me!""

my point is .. SM needs to be called out, it was used by Blockstream, its being used again, it took years to get people to wake up to Blockstream and their tactics, it won't take so long this time (whether or not the tactics are **intentional** the end results are the same! i'm sure greg also had ""bitcoins best intentions"" in mind also)",1522592333

"Monero is a good privacy coin but I am siding with zcash. With the upcoming upgrades and new protocols, the shielded transaction sizes will be reduced by over 75% which will make mobile and GUI wallets more easily developed to accept private transactions. IMO this is also what is holding back Monero in a lot of ways. I think Zcash did a smart thing by also having transparent transactions as well (though I do truly believe that in order for Zcash to become the unanimous go-to privacy coin they will need to phase out transparent tx and addrs) as private transactions because the public transactions work just like bitcoin and there are numerous gui and mobile wallets that support it. By doing that they have attracted more users by making it very easy to use zcash (like bitcoin) and they keep those users afterwards with their shielded transaction benefits and long-term views/goals. 

I don't want to get into Monero vs Zcash as I think they are both really good and technologically ages ahead of BTC. However I like the dev team and the technology behind the shielded transactions.

It's fascinating: w/ negligible exceptions, almost every single line that you can read on newspapers about Bitcoin &amp; related topics are ABSOLUTELY wrong/false. Not just slightly incorrect or oversimplified: the complete, exact OPPOSITE of reality!  

My favourites:  

* 1) ""Miners use computers capable of solving VERY COMPLEX computations!""  

No, those ""computers"" solve one of the LEAST COMPLEX you could imagine: just guessing random numbers. Pretty simple. Then they have to check them against a SHA2 function, just like any other non-mining node.  

* 2) ""Mining hardware VALIDATES transactions, ensuring they respect Bitcoin's rules!""  

No, mining hardware doesn't validate ANYTHING at all. It just receive (hopefully validated) transactions from full nodes: sometimes the farm operator's one, more often the mining pool's one.  

* 3) ""If somebody controls 51% of hashrate, he controls Bitcoin!""  

No, even if somebody controls 100% of hashrate he still cannot turn invalid transactions into valid (stealing, inflating, changing rules). W/ &gt;50%, he can just CENSOR transactions, in the future in the past (reorg).  

* 4) ""Blockchains are more efficient, faster &amp; cheaper than traditional, centralized technologies. We can replace them to save costs &amp; time!""  

No, ""blockchains"" are LESS efficient, SLOWER &amp; more EXPENSIVE (to run but also to setup/mantain) than traditional centralized technologies.  

* 5) ""Blockchains are EFFICIENT, FAST &amp; CHEAP compared to traditional centralized technologies. We can replace the latter w/ the former to save costs &amp; time!""  

No: ""blockchains"" are INEFFICIENT, SLOW &amp; EXPENSIVE (to run but also to setup/mantain) compared to traditional technology.  

* 6) ""Blockchains use encryption &amp; they are PRIVATE, compared to traditional centralized technologies. We can use them to encrypt/protect sensitive data!""  

No: ""blockchains"" are generally unencrypted, cleartext, PUBLIC to EVERYBODY &amp; FOREVER, terrible for privacy/confidentiality.  

* 7) ""Bitcoin can be surpassed, but the underpinning blockchain tech is revolutionary (cf. 5&amp;6). We should research blockchain w/o Bitcoin!""  

No: blockchains can be surpassed (cf. 5&amp;6), but the underpinning bitcoin asset is revolutionary. We are researching Bitcoin w/o blockchain.  

* 8) ""Bitcoin is mostly used by violent people to commit crimes!""  

No: Bitcoin will be mostly used by honest people to stop/mitigate/fight/escape/avoid/neutralize/nullify horrible crimes, today routinely committed by violent people: taxation, prohibition, market manipulation, etc.  

* 9) ""Bitcoin's tech is trivial &amp; nowadays obsolete, surpassed by other, most advanced ""crypto"" projects!""  

No: Bitcoin is by far the most advanced, up-to-date, bleeding-edge innovative FOSS/Crypto project out there, w/ likely one of the highest concentrations of brain-power ever.  

* 10) ""Altcoins invented new stuff that Bitcoin devs couldn't imagine!""  

No: ALL selling-points in altcoin marketing (tangles, ZKPs, etc.) have previously been evaluated &amp; dismissed/deferred by Bitcoin pioneers, sometimes even before Bitcoin itself (eg: PoS in bmoney, AD 1998).  

The end? Probably not, but I am sleepy, and 10 is a biblical number anyway (even if I confirm my absolute devotion to the tonal cause, @LukeDashjr!!!).

Quantum entanglement is a non-existent phenomenon within Bitcoin and computer network technology.

The speed of light is only relevant regarding fibre optic cables. Data is transmitted so fast that physical distances are less relevant.

"LN is ONE application, which quite honestly shouldn't even matter in this argument given it's still in early development, but we can if it makes it easier for you. DDoS against LN doesn't get you control of the tokens, it simply degrades the LN network.

Also LN isn't really a ""scaling solution"" - its a application that has scaling solutions built in. Again, another argument.

Security on layer one is simple by design. If you ran a shop and you accepted BTC/BCH your terminal either has a wallet built in, or interfaces with another machine that runs the node. From this point you have some pretty obvious channels for exploit - I'm not saying its easy, but if we are building for the future then we need to look a the risks.

One of the things that A LN implementation does is have better RPC protocol with more defined permissions, so for example (not even looking at the LN aspect) a terminal could generate an invoice but not send funds or get the balance. Where as your machine given you are the business owner could get balance. 

If you use Coinbase or Bitpay as a layer one solution, the advantage here is that your coins are held behind a 2FA, you can easily liquidate your funds to USD to buy more supplies, or use the data export tools to help do any taxes and accounting.

What frustrates me as a crypto enthusiast, and as someone who has both BTC and BCH is the narrow mindedness from everyone about how problems are solved. ",1522591099

People see this as an investment tool to make faster returns in the shortest time possible. Many will lose money and only a hand group of lucky people will make money and advertise it all over social media

Tether is a number one player in guiding the waves of cryptocurrency prices. They pump it with fake money and then it grabs the attention of the masses who then invest in it. This is what the owners of tether want. They then dump the prices and secure returns. The ones who make the money are the ones who get out quick and tether owners themselves. 

Realize when the talks about audits came about the bitcoin prices started to fall. Tether wanted to protect the audit so they dumped the fake money along with Mt Gox or maybe Mt Gox is just a name they are using to justify the dump.

This unstable project will never be a currency and is totally a Ponzi scheme pumped with fake money at times. It‚Äôs way too coordinated. There will be another bull run that‚Äôs when I‚Äôm leaving this shitty scam project that‚Äôs all pumped with fake tether money and then dumped again. Every year it‚Äôs the same story and every year tether pumps this shitty ‚Äútechnology‚Äù to grab the attention of the masses. The cycle will never end. The next bull run will be stronger I recommend that‚Äôs when we should leave this scam project and move into actual investments. This is a pure pump and dump project. Eventually it will become so big that tether will dump all the bitcoins and make multi billions of dollars. It‚Äôs too early for that right now but when it will happen I‚Äôd hope that you are already back to fiat

You are wrong they control btc and they can do very easy. Here is example from life. For example there is 100 banana in world and no more (21mln btc) one day I decide to pump it up so I buy all btc and agree sell them just at higher price but no one wants to buy them at my price so I call my friend and ask him to buy my banana at higher price and because its my good friend he do this he buys from me 1 banana at price 120$. Market ticker shows last price 120$ my bananas valuation is 12000$ at current price but I need to spend just 10120$ to get it because I buy all bananas for 100$ and I ask friend to buy one for 120$ to manipulate market price higher. If third person comes to market we will sell him just at higher price because we still controlling all supply and while no one agree to buy at higher price there will be no market price will stay at 120$. Thats the price manipulation higher. Lets talk now about unregulated exchages and how they manipulate price lower. So we have all bananas in hand fud goes on price keep rising because everyone things it will rise forever limited supply new money no one wants to sell at lower prices then they buy and one day me and my friend decides ok we have a lot of money need to cash out because me and my friend buy them at 100$ at best price and now price is thousands so we start selling at better prices then in market. If market price is 1000$ we offer for rich to buy it at 950$ big amounts but not in market because we dont need anyone to see that we selling so we use OTC trades. Big investor comes because he decide to open exchange and he need liquidity in btc so he buys all our coins at 950$ Market price still 1000$ because we done deal not at market price but over OTC times goes on and price goes even more higher now one banana cost 2000$ those people who buy from us decides that they need to cash out and they start flushing market at any possible price. They flush market with bananas every time some biger buys comes they sell for them and price goes to 1500$ those rich mans own exchange who is not regulated and have no banas left to sell because its limited supply and hey sold everything because they are unregulated they decide to play against own clients. How its possible? How its possible to them to manipulate prices down still? Tghey dont have banan to sell!!! Its possible because all they clients hold bananas in exchange  so no matter how much they buy if they not takes them from exchange those still can be used by exchange to sell and drive market down you buy at for example 1500$ price rise to 1600$ they sell you btc price drops to 1500$ you buy again they sell your btc at 1550$ you buy again they sell at 1520$ pressuring that 1500$ and once you out of money to buy  it brakes 1500$ and game repeats who ever will buy those btc eth or whatever if they stay in exchange they will be used against you people have to understand price is easily manipulated when you ahve power to do that and when people let you to do that ,1522588668

The same effect can be seen with alt coins, being historically dependent on BTC direction. Any marginal rent seeking fiat pushed into crypto goes (not into BTC but..) into a secondary market (dependent on the primary..). 

Hence theres a weird catch 22 event, where interdependence rules out the preliminary motivation. Meaning the very purpose of going long (to gain more BTC, compared to buying regular spot BTC), is defeated in that placing betting produces a manipulable secondary market.

I pointed out a few times that it was oversimplified and did not capture the important cases from the paper in question. To that extent, to argue against its ‚Äòresults‚Äô would be a straw man. Perhaps it has other uses, but in the context of this discussion, it is not particularly relevant. Indeed, it seems as if your conception changed after one of my messages.

Yes, my style is typically argumentative and contentious, and has been criticized by others, including /u/JustSomeBadAdvice, but I never misrepresent my intentions, and argue in good faith (as best I can). I also learn a lot. I found out about the SM paper from reddit years ago, and thought the results were interesting but not too alarming. 

I have a particular interest in weeding out bad actors like Craig, who misrepresent themselves and refuse to **ever** admit when they‚Äôre wrong, which I see as a sign of bad faith. Maybe that‚Äôs why I keep insisting that you answer the question of whether you concede that you were mistaken about my sim and the question. 

Speaking of the sim, it might be useful to you to answer your question [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/88acc6/eli5_why_the_one_who_actually_doesnt_understand/dwmacfz/). It simulates all solved blocks (including orphans), so it would be straightforward to get some data about the (new) time distributions of the actual chain.

*Several sovereign wealth funds and Asian investors have bought the bitch on a secret auction, which was a Deloitte consultant.*

full translation:

**Bulgaria secretly sells battle for 3 billion euros**
*We are buying a new Air Force squadron*

The Finance Ministry has displaced 200,000 cops seized by the Prosecutor's Office after a successful operation against customs fraudsters. The transaction was secretly concluded at the most advantageous moment at the end of December 2017 and has brought to the budget 6 billion levs, which means that for one battle we have taken 15 000 euros.

This was reported by Vladislav Goranov to the Security Council at the Prime Minister, who was summoned for the Skripal case. The real topic, however, was what to do with this money. The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbuying squadrons of new aircraft for the army.

Several sovereign wealth funds and Asian investors have bought the bitch on a secret auction, which was a Deloitte consultant. Experts from the US FBI have helped to ensure the safety of the transactions that have been deferred over time, the latter being scheduled for the early hours of April 1, Goranov reported.

The reshuffle was necessary in order not to collapse the market with such a powerful one-off offering of battlefields, according to an expert from the CoinDesk site, to which Biovoly has consulted. From there, they checked the cryptographic statistics and confirmed that from now until now, an unknown operator had poured a little over 198,000 battleships. According to experts, this is one reason why the price of the crypto-wave drops slowly.

For the confiscated battlefield, it was understood that on May 29, 2017, the Southeast European Crime Counterfeiting Center (SELEC) announced on its official site the large-scale international operation PRAKTA / VIRUS, in which the Bulgarian authorities seized over 200,000 battleships. Subsequently, the Prosecutor's Office and the GDOC disowned it, but it was part of the conspiracy operation - the most successful in our service history.

According to Bivolov, Prime Minister Borisov will offer Sotir Tsatsarov, Vlady Goranov and himself for government awards.",1522584708

"The ""tangle"" (a specific DAG implementation) is definitely interesting, but also has so many complexities that until it's matured a *lot* and undergone *significant* attacks (by people much smarter than me), I don't think it's safe to say that it's a robust system.

Bitcoin is - so far - the only cryptocurrency implementation that has proven itself in the face of many different kinds of attacks and continued to thrive.

The game theory seems to work; the network seems to work; and the anti-fragility seems to work.  Until another cryptocurrency can say the same, I see no reason to consider them viable alternatives to bitcoin.

Of course there's nothing stopping a massive social campaign from making everyone fall in love with some other coin making it temporarily the ""king"".  But if that happens and it turns out to be flawed, then those flaws will be exposed and the coin will be destroyed.

I imagine that that scenario would cause a massive distrust in all cryptocurrency for a long time (which would crash the exchange value of them all and decrease the participation quite a lot), but bitcoin would continue to function and function well as it always has.  Over time, people may regain interest in crypto and the only system that anyone could clearly point to as *not* having the potential failure of ""that other one was successfully attacked"" would be bitcoin.",1522584355

"You did a shit job.  I'll explain.  If you're not a paid shill then forgive my boorish tone.  I genuinely hate bcash.  I mean I really hate it on a deep fundamental level.  

1.  Graphene offers nice advantages if we were actually transmitting 1mb blocks over the network.  We don't.  See Greg Maxwell's talk on [advances in block proagation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHIuuKCm53o).  Graphene doesn't really offer any advantages over what Bitcoin does today.  You really need to lock down the order to get maximum value from the block propagation, but that means the block would be constantly changing significantly as new transactions come in.  You'd be essentially redoing the block.  Now new transactions can be added to the top of the merkle tree and you don't need to redo all the hashes below it.

2.  

&gt;According to this paper verifying a 32MB block take 6.86s. According to their scaling formula, verifying a 1G block would take about 5 minutes. Which is much larger, but less than the ten minute bitcoin block time. Also, this paper is from 2015 and there have been improvements since then.  

So you realize that the only mining nodes that matter according to btrash are the pool nodes right?  Those pools handle a lot of money. You don't want those nodes being publicly accessible.  So they need to send their blocks to trusted nodes then lets say they don't actually even bother validating the blocks and just pass it on.  The next layer of nodes connected will validate the nodes completely before moving on.  If your a smaller pool and you aren't in that first layer your fucked, not to mention the block finder has a 5 minute headstart.  This encourages mining empty blocks.  Not very useful. 


just because it's not required for everyone to run the chain.  When we have 5 billion people on the system it should be feasible for there to be ~1 million nodes or more.   5 billion spv to 5 pool nodes isn't decentralized it's worse than central banks.  

Competing with Visa is a mile stone.  It's not a final destination.  

The real issue with large blocks is it centralizes us heavily to the traditional internet networks ether, cable, fiber.  It rules out mesh nets and satellites.  If Bitcoin is going to be a global currency it needs to be durable AF.  Being able to still transact with Bitcoin after a hurricane that knocked out the power grid and internet infrastructure because businesses and individuals had a satellite, raspberry pi, and easily accessible hard drive.  Setup a mesh network.  People from all over the world can get money to friends and families who might be in tough situations.  maybe a cell tower would work for internet and mesh networks could be setup to extend it's range.  

People could have emergency bitcoin addresses for friends and family.  Move some bitcoin as sign of life and request for money.  Send it to one address if you need money or another if you're good.  

So I said that I hate Btrash and I do.  If I could i'd stab it 516120 times ... it would be a good workout.  I do like Btrash as a test of Bitcoin.  Thanks to btrash I have so much more confidence in Bitcoin.    ",1522582785

"Hi Jeff. The risk of 0-conf is a double-spend, selfish mining has no *required connection* with double-spends. I see you try to avoid double-spends by monitoring the network, but I wonder whether this is enough.

Exchanges are vulnerable to double spends because a deposit is not actually a ""spend"", in the sense that one departs with his money. A malicious attacker can ""spend"" (deposit) and withdraw repeated times until one double-spend goes through. Bitcoin mining incentives *force* a miner to ""waste"" around 12.5bch of electricity to mine a block. This means an attacker could buy 10% of the BCH hashpower in nicehash, earn 14 block rewards and double-spend you 14 times in a day! Depending on the block time, he could have a good half an hour before the exchange realizes a double-spend occurred and decides to revert his transactions. Even disallowing immediate withdraw seems not enough, as he could ""launder"" the money to another account in his favor e.g. exploiting a thin book depth. Would you describe the protective measures you take to avoid this scenario? Wouldn't one huge double-spend risk the solvency of the whole exchange?",1522581817

"I see people in this thread generally answer OP responding as if he needs teaching to buy low and sell high. He literally  stated in his personal background info how well he understands markets.
ITT people stating ""buy when there's a bear market or when people think btc won't go up"". I hope you realize a bear market can be there for a long time. If you buy in the early part of a bear market, you're still not picking a smart moment.

The answer OP is looking for is whether now is the evening before a bullish trend arises in crypto markets or not. On a side note, OP could also be making this thread simply to get a grasp of but the general pereception of the market right now is and take his conclusions from that, as he seems to understand market cycles and when to get in at the very least fairly well. 

Personally I don't have the answer for you because I feel similar as to that it's mostly speculation. The problem with predicting the trend of the price action lies with what really drives the price; people's expectation of where the price is heading. Once you realise this is mostly in the hands of bigger news outlets and to a smaller extent big scene influencers on Twitter and YouTube, you realise you can't predict what the puppet masters are planning as their next move.

Personally my safest bet is to Always look at bigger trends and don't get caught up in the moment aka don't look at the 5min and hourly charts too much and trade cycles instead. Wait for a wide spectrum of bullish signs to occur before trading a cycle in terms of getting in and regarding that same field of thought: don't let a bull trap tempt you to go in prematurely. Especially since the crypto markets and more volatile than the clasic stock market is, you need a slight change of attitude realise a sudden extreme 2 day run-up doesn't mean the end of a bearish period necessarily.
So in conclusion I would say it's too early to say now is the right moment and anyone claiming he/she has the answer is either an extremely wealthy insider or full of bs.

There is no singular intent. Bitcoin Cash isn't owned by any one entity or person, like how bcore is with blockstream. There is one proposal where the likelihood of having terabyte blocks in **20 years** is quite achievable and cheap for any business that has an interest in verifying their own payments.

"Here is the comment linked in the above comment: 

Malleability is the possibility of creating a transaction, broadcasting it, and then re-creating the same transaction with a different transaction ID, and broadcasting it again.

It has to do with a specific vulnerability in any software built to monitor specific transactions IDs instead of the addresses involved.

It is a well-documented flaw that people have worked around by simply not building software that relies on transaction IDs, however, any side-chain or cross pegged system can be made to work much more efficiently by relying on IDs only. Thusly, fixing malleability should make things like LN easier to build and operate.

First party malleability: only the transaction creator can change the ID and rebroadcast

Third party malleability: anyone can pick up the transaction, change the ID, and rebroadcast.

SegWit fixed first and third party malleability with SegWit transactions. Legacy transactions are still fully vulnerable to both on BTC.

Bitcoin Cash is now only vulnerable to first party, the fix for this is slightly more complex, but is being worked on.

It's not simply a term that can or should be applied to any and all things that aren't explicitly centrally controlled. 

&gt;My house isn't subject to the rules of a Home Owners Association, but that doesn't make my neighborhood ""anarchist"". Perhaps the term you're looking for bitcoin is ""decentralised"", but it's certainly not ""anarchist"".

In 3rd world countries, most users won't have internet access, but many will have a SMS-capable cellphone.

That woman can then send crypto to her nephew in another village, etc. He can do a similar process in his village, if he wants.

My guess is that convenience stores will serve as fiat-crypto terminals, like a Western Union type system.

And it popped. What else can you call a decline of 65-95% (depending on the crypto) in the span of 3 months? Bubbles popping don't mean the asset becomes worth zero. The NASDAQ didn't go to zero. The U.S. housing bubble popping did not mean homes went to zero. Japanese stocks did not go to zero when the Nikkei bubble popped. The South Sea Company bubble popped in 1720, but he company continued to operate until 1855. A bubble just means that prices rose too far too fast and were unsustainable in the short term and so crashed tremendously also in the short term. ",1522577948

Lastly, it's very easy to lose perspective. For how many years has Bitcoin, the OG of OGs, stumbled around and seen huge swings? It's taken for granted in the crypto world now that Bitcoin is legit and here to stay but it wasn't that long ago that it was as much of a hopeful wish as any of the top 25 coins right now.

"The previous PBOC bank head was pro market. Most people in the china communist party are pro market. The issue is not about how people in the communist party view the market, free or otherwise. 
The issue with members of regulatory bodies in China is how do they ensure that all behaviour and action defines and supports the communist party of China. 
They could tomorrow say that pink dinosaurs are real and everyone must have one, but it has nothing to do with that in the end. What matters is to what end does it support the China communist party. 
When you stop looking through the lens of ""what do communists do to alter capitalism"" and start thinking about ""what enables their party to remain unified,"" it makes more sense, and you begin to see there is no attack on bitcoin.
There never was, they simply just don't want it to infringe on their ability to lead.

2.I agree with this point and I am concerned about their choice to copy monero'a code.japan is already clamping down on exchanges listing privacy coins due to hackers using them to smuggle stolen loot.will have to see if this will affect the overall project and its survivability because of it.
3.unless you can show a link between ETN and those shills then the fact there are so many of them is irrelevant..the vast majority of youtubers are shillls.interestingly they mostly try to shill low value coins since they are cheap(tron,verge,ETN),but that is a reflection of the price ,not the project.",1522570772

Well no it isn't, obviously, but I think that your point is that buying bitcoin is gambling even though there are no ""odds"", there is no ""luck"" and there is no ""house"". 

You're basically saying that whether or not bitcoin becomes truly relevant as a currency depends on luck. Not the tech behind it, not it's actual use cases, not it's immutability or the backing of X,Y,Z and not due to the time and efforts of hundreds of people throughout the past 10 or so years. Luck. When adoption has hit the masses, you'll say ""bitcoiners got lucky"" when all of the signs had been there for you too. Think about that for a while.",1522570226

Nvidia is one example, but the moment an established, F500-type decides to get into mining, EX or DEX, or any non-trading, protocol-based aspect of crypto, this will start taking off in a big way. (edit) As in, R&amp;D from these types putting its time and effort toward btc is a really exciting/scary thought. If that means they have the wherewithal via funding/computing power to successfully launch a 51%, etc. then btc will adapt, or we can realize this was all a fun experiment but won't work.

Well first things first. Crypto is meant to be trustless. Censorship resistant. With the premine that they have, rigging the prices is easy.

"The Bitcoin design paper never described the entire software code as such. It's only an overview of the fundamentals. He was gonna write an appendix to it to better explain some concepts, but never got around to it before he left. 

The name Bitcoin Cash is in the end just a name chosen to differentiate it from the other chain. In a talk from a few years ago, a theoretician suggested that in a highly contentious forking scenario the two resulting forks could be called Bitcoin contender 1 and 2. Bitcoin Cash simply chose a more descriptive and less confusing name. Bitcoin SL (Segwit+Legacy, ticker BTC, ""Core"") has for the most part so far kept it's name on exchanges etc, even if this can be confusing.That's understandable, because if there had been no controversy around which chain was _valid_, the Bitcoin SL chain would undoubtedly have been the only legitimate Bitcoin and this is still how most people see things.

I would not be able to source that Satoshi (which I consider a dead character at this point) ended up always and is still considering the paper a guide to what Bitcoin is (in fact I have my personal opinion that whoever was him most likely does not at this point and I think that's a wrong decision on his part, just as he probably should have written the design paper clearer in this regard), only that it was how he presented it to us. The reason is likely simple; He didn't want and expect anything but length of chain to be a topic of discussion in identifying Bitcoin. He most likely never expected neither blocksize or side chains to even be controversial.

It doesn't matter what the community wants. Really it doesn't. If they want to restrict access to their coin then they should do a private blockchain.

Asking pretty please does not work in the real world. If you cannot code 'ASICS are not allowed' into the code then ASICS are allowed. 


&gt;If you don't show respect to them and still want to steal coins 

Its not stealing if you are playing by the rules. The code allows ASICS and thus the coins were earned not stolen. No one owned the coins prior to their mining so they cannot be considered stolen.

&gt;from them then don't be sorry when they change PoW algo and render your piece of shit hardware useless.

Who said anything about feeling sorry for them. I don't care if they succeeded or fail. It sounds like they did well so good for them.

&gt;bitcoin will have to follow the same path sooner or later.

No it won't. And no it shouldn't. 

What is the doomsday scenario Bitcoin will face if it doesn't? How do you think ASICS will kill Bitcoin? Its the honey badger it gives no shits about whether you use ASICS or not. Use whatever works and those who use shitty equipment won't do as well.

If everyone mined bitcoin with shitty GPUs then all it would take is an ASIC mining farm to rewrite the history. Do you really want to force the honest miners to use sub par tools? This is an arms race and we do not want the bad guys to be the only ones with guns. 

&gt;Satellites however, will keep the network in sync 

The internet does that just fine

&gt;and prevent any orphaned blocks from generating in case of a government internet shutdown.

Satellites are not preventing orphan blocks and the government cannot shut down the internet. Do you have any idea how much chaos, death and destruction that would cause? Most people are unable to work without the internet, many shops would be unable to sell goods, and most people cannot afford to live without access to an ATM. 

If they did shut down the internet and for some reason did not shut down your satellite, the satellite would not be able to handle the load. It would be unintentionally DDOSed

&gt;You talk about it is not an issue but it is an issue.

Orphaned blocks would be the least of your concerns in that scenario.

&gt;While China has the biggest btc farms and they are behind the biggest firewall ever, and living in a communist country, all is possible.

Instead of shutting down the internet, it would be easier for China just to shut down the farms. They use enough electricity that it would be impossible to hide. Really much easier. How will your satellites protect us against that?

&gt;Blockstream did this to prevent your countrys fuckery. 

My country? I ain't Chinese. 

&gt;All you (bitmain) did was cracking algos, making things centralized and stealing mining from home miners.

Home miners don't have a monopoly on mining. Out competing is not stealing. Are you against capitalism?

"Even with the dip in price Im sitting with 5 times profit. Thats better than any bank will ever give you. Sold a little to now reduce exposure, but kept enough.

If BTC goes to zero Ive lost virtually nothing, if it moons Im a millionaire. How you like them apples?",1522566807
"Okay.. but you tried to strawman me by painting me as a ""bcasher"".  Are you even following your own words?  Self awareness guy.  It's a thing.  

&gt; What I do have a problem with is people peddling bcash as bitcoin.

Get used to it.  Bitcoin is a free and opensource software project.  There are going to be hundreds of versions of the bitcoin blockchain eventually.  

Have you ever heard ""You create your own stress"" ?",1522566732
Bitcoin is gay,1522566674
Hold in until I can use BTC at my local grocery store. And then...I won't even need to sell. ,1522566643
"How does longing work with crypto? Like, how could I take out a mortgage with Bitcoin? ",1522566598

See this then.

DustyBC has made videos of electroneum going to 1500 dollars by 2018. All in all their subreddit turns me off. Asking them anything of concern is called FUD. 

Am no expert in crypto with a mere 7 month experience, but am smelling something bad here. Something's wrong here.",1522566584
"You are correlating price increase and adoption  
This is a false correlation  
Bitcoin will go down when the speculator price bubble bursts, and then adoption will improve",1522566557
Either way he does not understand Bitcoin.,1522566554
"Crypto relies on game theory to work.

Game theory pretty clearly shows that if you build a money-printing machine, that selling it is NOT the best decision. The optimal decision is to use it *just* enough to maintain the appearance of real work being profitable to the general public. This doesn't disturb the value of the currency while giving you the largest possible advantage. 

It's totally fair to expect someone to create a money printer (ASIC). So what should the currency do? Regularly fork to make the ASIC a poor investment. 

In my opinion it's just a matter of time before we realize how absurd the mining arms race is and we firm to a different system. Like maybe cuckoo cycle #\#grin.

(I agree that, given the current climate, the best decision for Nvidia and AMD would be to be heavily invested in crypto mining.)",1522566544
Waiting for the day when 1 BTC = 1 Lambo,1522566542
"Hmm this is interesting. 

According to bitcoin full node map most nodes are in US and Germany. 
https://bitnodes.earn.com

The cost of mining in Germany is around $14000. Are those guys operating at loss, or does mining have other sources of income than just the coins mined?

",1522566533
"Well that's how it called. You can check nearly every altcoin website and you find them listed there as well.

It's nothing special it's just how it is. They published something and bam they're media partners. You shouldn't lmao because they're called media partners but rather because some people really thought that they're business partners and are since mad about icon. 

There you can see how delusional most crypto kiddy's are.",1522566453
"I expect a return to mean, then a fundamentals discovery period. Then an actual bull run, then the end of BTC, but not the end of cryptocurrencies.

Meanwhile, I will go back and just build stuff. Next up is a better UI/UX for BitID, it needs some more love. &lt;3",1522566448
Let's create some Crypto FUD on April Fools. What a great idea to realise before we collectively shit on the streets. ,1522566375
If you bought lambo worth of BTC now you have barely lambo-doors worth left. ,1522566329
"Government should give women some free bitcoin to make things equal. Oh wait...they can't just print it like fiat, can they. 

Imagine the government buying billions in bitcoin with fiat to solve this problem. This is what wet dreams are made of XD",1522566314
And now when  you want to trade on any reputable exchange you will have to convert to BTC and then back to BCH ... I think you will lose a shit ton in fees .... It still doesn't make sense ,1522566233
"I think it is too early to tell which ""won"".

Bitcoin grew from 2012 and forward on investment capital in its ecosystem, and the effects of working money doesn't show for 6-9 months.

The first 3 months of BCH was uncertainty of investment since s2x was still on track. Since s2x failed, though, alot of money has been invested companies that work in that ecosystem and in 6-9 months we will have a clearer picture.

Some volatility along the way is expected.",1522566055
