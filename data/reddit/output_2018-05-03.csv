&gt;So you think the Core developers are watching/influencing the market and trading bitcoin long and short in order to make money?

Core strategy is not set by ""core developers"" but by a guy or two at the top.

For example [this one guy set strategy for 2+ years running with this document](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-December/011865.html).  The document was claimed to be supported by team members with 90% of commits to Core, but only after the team leads had assigned all kinds of old commits to themselves and also ""committed"" all kinds of little cleanups to the code.  Non signatories were no longer welcome on the team. 

Totally apolitical. /s",1525417196

"Nah, I’m fairly sure the internet is a stronger network. I would be fairly certain that Facebook is a bigger network. I’m also fairly certain that the US Dollar and every other govt issued currency is legal tender, unlike Bitcoin.

Finally, can you all bitcoiners tell me, how you can trust a trustless coin unless you’re able to read the source coin yourself? How do you know it’s not written to be a scam? Why do you trust experts? Isn’t that the point - you don’t need to trust anyone? If you need experts, why not just have someone who you elect or who you know is accountable (ie the Fed) who controls the money flow? The reason I ask is because I’m fairly certain that mass adoption can’t happen because it’s ‘trustless’ or ‘decentralised’ because a human wrote a code and then another dude/dudette is telling the non technically proficient whether it’s good enough? 

Or is it hard to accept the fact you made money off a concept via speculation?",1525417155
"Then by your rationale what we'd call ""economic nodes"" like BitPay or exchanges like Coinbase which run some software such as BitcoinABC to  stay in line with the BCH network (or BTC network, running Bitcoin Core) are not actually running nodes at all. They might as well run SPV wallets like Electron Cash/Electrum, since they still provide the functionality they need which is sending/receiving transactions. And the only people running ""nodes"" would be miners like Bitmain. Correct?",1525417122
"Even of bitcoin was ubiquitous in stores where I live I'd probably still use my credit card. Its just so convinient. Every store had it. Its touchless, and I dont even have to type my pin. Payment *literally* takes 3 sec from the store clerk is ready (generates invoice on terminal) till payment. Fees are negliable too.

And it fraud insured\protected (actually just forgot it at gas station and had it abused, got all my money back).

Sure its not trustless or decentralized, but trust and centralization makes this possible.

Until bitcoin can compete in this market, bitcoins use lies elewhere.

there's no reason to expect greater hodl fools into perpetuity or to expect hodl will lead to a coin being adopted in the future for use as money or to perpetually go up.  in fact i would argue hodl harms this mission as it puts the coins simply in the hands of speculators and as long as more keep coming in, the currency becomes highly deflationary and people will not spend it - which needs to happen for actual adoption to take place and find an actual stable purchasing power for the currency.",1525416484

"**Packet Assembler/Disassembler**

A packet assembler/disassembler, abbreviated PAD is a communications device which provides multiple asynchronous terminal connectivity to an X.25 (packet-switching) network or host computer. It collects data from a group of terminals and places the data into X.25 packets (assembly). A PAD also does the reverse, it takes data packets from packet-switching network or host computer and returns them into a character stream that can be sent to the terminals (disassembly). A Frame Relay Assembler/Disassembler (FRAD) is a similar device for accessing Frame Relay networks.

BTC can't be used if it can't scale. We saw that last December when people were paying $50 to move their coins. The point of BTC's scaling plan, that they've been working on since 2015, is to enable scaling without adding to the blockchain.

I forget about all of it the next morning because I have a very demanding job to attend to. And when I get back home and read about crypto at night, the cycle continues. 

My main strategy right now is to invest in couple of solid coins (the usual suspect, btc, eth, and the like) and a couple of potentially moon coins, where I researched the fuck out of it.

It was also an all or nothing approach, either a fund achieved its goal and everyone paid (wether work was done or not) or it didn’t and no one paid. There was no way to check if the actual work would get done or not. 

It was also being pushed as a model to remove the Bitcoin Foundation and Lighthouse was the winner of the award to complete the work to do that. It was billed as a decentralised Kickstarter. This is what got some people excited as at the time the Bitcoin Foundation was keenly discussed (it seemed everyday). 

Don’t get me wrong, I’m all for a decentralised Kickstarter and can see a use for that. But also don’t forget that the key reason in 2014 Lighthouse was born was to provide financial incentives for code to be worked on across the Bitcoin ecosystem (outside of the Bitcoin Foundation) which to many was not needed (as many developers were working in bitcoin for personal not financial reasons) and also because in general devs worked on their own areas of interest no matter how much a bounty may be.

It got me to thinking on a macro level. Crypto just seems to be the natural evolution of the corporation into something bigger, more efficient, and fairer. 

In a similar sense, corporations were an evolution of the partnership/closely-held businesses of the early 20th century. But now it seems like people are outgrowing the centralized nature of corporations and we have new technology (blockchain) that allows us to evolve. 

We just haven't quite figured out the potential and essence of crypto like we have corporations, with which we are already familiar. So when we compare market caps of corporations and crypto, it's really two very different animals and crypto is not subject to the same limitations as corporations. It's just a matter a time until we see where this thing takes us. Blockchain will do to the 21st century what corporations did to the 20th century.

"Critical Alert: Warning Regarding The Company TokenGet

This is a critical alert for all cryptocurrency investors, enthusiasts, and companies who may come into contact with TokenGet, from Sophia, Bulgaria. (https://tokenget.com/)

TokenGet is a company that MOBILINK-COIN hired and paid up-front for their Turnkey ICO solution. In fact, the CEO, Viktor Petrov, attends many of the international crypto conferences to recruit individuals to work with his company. TokenGet was recommended by respected ICO advisors.

For months, all activity, implementation, and communication worked smoothly; however, as our ICO end date drew closer, we needed to extend out ICO launch by 20 days and Tokenget went sideways demanding full payment for the extension. We assumed as a partner, there would be no issues and that greed would not drive the combined goals of launching our ICO. We are alleging TokenGet silently hijacked the entire system. Our investigators alleging that:

1. TokenGet hacked into MOBILINK-COIN's Google-cloud and changed passwords and all credentials, which, in addition to other information, stole the company's payment data.

2. TokenGet moved the backend platform from our Google-cloud account and stole our database after locking us out.

3. TokenGet misappropriated tokens to four separate wallets without our authorization or knowledge. There was a possible theft or at a minimum, misappropriation of at least 900 million tokens. Those four transactions occurred just days before our ICO end date which equates to 15 times more than the entire ICO sold.

4. TokenGet attempted to extort MOBILINK-COIN by refusing to give back our database and platform in which the company already paid all fees in advance of TokenGet doing any work.

5. TokenGet misled and misinformed MOBILINK-COIN when they created the ERC20 token and created it with their own ETH Address instead of having our company create it. This was purposely done so they would be able to extort or manipulate the token at any time without MOBILINK-COIN or its investors' knowledge.

We have taken several critical steps to protect each of our investors with a brand-new token and dashboard; we will go live on several Exchanges in the next few days. Because we have created a new token, this means the old MOBL token becomes an abandoned token; therefore, has no value. 
The lack of integrity and willingness to behave illicitly on the part of TokenGet is simply unacceptable. No company should be held hostage by a mafia-like organization who is extorting, stealing, and causing industry-wide concerns in the crypto world. We are taking steps to ensure TokenGet is caught and prosecuted for what appears to be breaking Bulgarian and international laws. 

For those companies currently working with TokenGet, we advise you take immediate steps to gain full access to all areas of your business in order to not allow the same challenge to occur. While none of our investors will be harmed by what happened to us, we have significantly lost time and important resources, and we will not allow thugs like TokenGet to get away with this type of nefarious and damaging harm. 

We are calling out not only TokenGet but a sister company called Blockchainmob, who has our logo on their website are partnered in this malfeasance along with Nashwan Khatib owner of Mena Software. 

In a civil world, there are always remedies to support the continued success of a legitimate ICO that has hired an ICO developer. The allegations above came after recorded threats to do harm against an ICO. While the world talks about fraudulent ICO�s. nobody ever talks about ICO developers that commit alleged acts of fraud against their clients. The fact tokens were transferred out of our account is clearly a malicious intent to defraud their client, Mobilink-Coin If you are principal from a company working with TokenGet, and have specific questions, please feel free to email us at TokenGetSCAM@mobilink.io. We do not want this to happen to another company.",1525411884

"Your right, it should be referred to by its real name; Bitcoin LN",1525411176
"This is a huge misconception. You need to look at it when you equalize the units when compared to other crypto projects. (for some reason people ignore the decimal points in other projects) If people actually did the research they would realize the total supply per unit is actual only 33% larger than Bitcoins and owning a single GiOTA (1000 MIOTA) is MUCH MUCH scarcer than bitcoins since only 2.7 million will ever exist.

To compare apples against apples, let’s compute the respective smallest unit value and then let’s compare the relative “scarcity” of Bitcoin vs IOTA as per attached table:

As shown in the table, there is 32% more supply of IOTAs but the current price of their respective smallest units is 4,890% more in favor of Satoshis or Bitcoin!

For Example

*2.779.530.283.000.000 IOTA*

*2.100.000.000.000.000 Satishi*

https://imgur.com/yVut5M0

The below table shows the relative supply and prices of ETH, XRP and IOTA against BTC.

It shows that 1 BTC = 4,762 XRP = 4.71 ETH* = 132.36 MIOTA (*Note: ETH has no hard cap supply).

Thus using current prices, 1 BTC that is worth $9,244 = $4,320 worth of XRP = $3,212 worth of ETH = $287 worth of MIOTA.

But percentage wise compared to BTC price, we can see that the equivalent quantity of XRP is currently 47% of one BTC; ETH at 35%; and MIOTA at only 3% of one BTC.

Here is a unit equalized table for other coins
https://imgur.com/n54q7YG

As you can see this ""too many coins in IOTA"" is actually not true and a misrepresentation only because IOTA does not use decimals like these other coins do. You need to first place the values in equal units and then you will quickly realize the true value per unit when equalized.",1525411019

Same thing with politics.  Many of the same tactics conservatives use to generalize liberals are found in this lovely crypto debate.    The worst part is it’s near impossible to debate or argue with any hope of influencing, teaching or even learning from others, as stubborness and name calling fuels the majority to focus not the wrong things.

It’s sad where civilization is headed.  I wish we could just admit and embrace that we dont have all the answers ..  the more we listen and question our own beliefs, the faster we will progress in any meaningful way.  

Clearly satoshi didn’t have all the answers.  He had amazing solutions and glimpses into the future state, many of which have shown to be true.  But just like anything in this world, there is no one right way to do anything .  And no single person or book or creed or religion should ever be followed without frequent checks and revisions and adaptations as we learn and eventually become smarter than the original idea and creator.

If/when that happens to fiat currency, the sponsoring state can manipulate the currency back on track.  The U.S. has done it multiple times now to turnaround recessions.  That is, the if it is a first world country or world superpower.  In the case of countries like Venezuela, good fucking luck.

Bitcoin has far more appeal to failed states or poor states.  It has far more appeal to poor people in the first world due to high risk/reward.  It has low appeal to the ruling classes.  Without their support it will not displace the fiat currency.  Everyone and their mother can accept personal payments in bitcoin, but if you can't pay your bills, buy lunch, and go grocery shopping with it then it is nothing more than a replacement for paypal/western union.  That is not a bad thing, though.  Just falls short of the ""TAKING OVER THE WORLD!!!!"" bullshit.",1525404223

If ideology is important to you, then the fundamental game-theoretical dynamics of self interest and reward maximisation that underpin Bitcoin should dictate that you pursue higher rewards - whether that is mining BTC, BCH, ETH or whatever.

Second, you effectively outsourced the whole operation by shipping it off to a mining operator. Maybe you thought it would be a cool hobby to get into, but you basically bought a loss making mining contract. You didn't get your hands dirty by rigging it all up, setting up the network, monitoring the output and playing with the cooling and sound dampening etc. So while you may think you are now a 'miner', hand-on-heart, you're not.

Bitcoin Cash is going for what _works_. It is not opposed necessarily to any method of scaling. That is a myth. LN is not part of bitcoin, it is being built to be put on _top_ of bitcoin. Other coins have talked about possibly implementing LN one day too, but only if and when ready. Unfortunately, LN as being proposed will likely never work, and certainly won't work with small blocks. You would need at least need a few hundred megabyte sized blocks for it to even begin to be able to try and function on a large scale.

"I'll give you some. Any rational person will agree, I expect to be brigaded since these are facts the scammers around don't like:

1 - segwit is a block capacity increase by removing signatures from the blocks, so one can fit extra Tx in each block;

2 - turns out, however, there is an extra block holding these signatures to be verified during consensus formation for obvious reasons;

3 - this block gets discarded, but it needs to exist because, well, we need to verify signatures otherwise it is very easy to steal funds;

4 - this means that the total load going through the network does require increased bandwidth the same way (only the blocks-without-signature *stored* in your HD will be effectively smaller);

5 - segwit effectively delivers *up to* 1.7 MB on top of those traditional 1 MB blocks, but to get there one needs to have a TOTAL of up to 4 MB;

6 - now how good is it a solution than increases the consensus load 4 times and delivers less than half the product? Would you like to buy a car 2x the size that can carry the same number of passengers, if your objective is to carry more passengers???

7 - segwit then delivers WORSE capacity result than simply increasing the blocks to 4 MB;

8 - segwit hurts severely future capacity increases because doubling the capacity will increase the network load over 4 times;

9 - turns out that storing in your physical HD the blockchain is NOT expensive, it is cheap: for instance, 32 MB blocks each 10 min (144 blocks per day) demands 32\*144\*365= 168.2 GIGs per year, [this costs 122 bucks!!](https://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA9H57172369&amp;cm_re=4tb_hard_drive-_-22-179-299-_-Product) and can give you 23 YEARS of block storage ... sounds reasonable?

10 - segwit optimizes the wrong thing and it makes worse the important thing, which is actually *latency* that bigger blocks bring (here we are talking about real big blocks, like above 400 MB), because latency increases in the consensus since each block found needs to be sent with all the Tx mined in that block, the other miners need to wait until the last bit of data to check it is good and move on mining on top of that block. 

11 - a 32 MB block gives already very close to *paypal Tx throughput* capabilities and it is really fast to download although it introduces more delays than 1 MB obviously;

12 - now you might think: ""why the hell people pushed segwit then?"", the answer is ""the LN""; LN is not the *only* layer 2 possibility, but it is the one full of patents and blockstream investment, and to use it they delivered a higly over hyped sub par solution just for the sake of migrating to LN; does it sound a bit crony to you?

13 - segwit also introduces more insecurity, as since the signatures (witness data) is excluded, in the case of a chain attack *you might not even know what the fuck is going on* since you don't have the friggin' signatures, does it sound like an asinine thing to do or what? No chain of signatures, no bitcoin, you can change it to whatever you want!! (seriously, satoshi knew what he was doing when he designed bitcoin)

&gt; The answer to all your questions is profit. They can do whatever they want in terms of holding coins, but by influencing an unregulated market they can easily profit off of pricing swings.

So you think the Core developers are watching/influencing the market and trading bitcoin long and short in order to make money?

Again, if BCH is going to be successful and BTC is not, and the Core developers are capable of seeing that, they would make more money jumping ship and simply hodling BCH. I just can't accept that they are that stupid, unless the motive is purely malicious, which I struggle to believe.

Correct.

&gt; My question is, how can a small group control the direction of an open source project with &gt;500 contributors?

Through censorship, gas lighting, and other forms of manipulation. Make sure you read this link if you haven't already:

[link 1](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/informative_btc_vs_bch_articles/dl8v4lp/?st=jaotbt8m&amp;sh=222ce783)

When Gavin Andresen, the person whom Satoshi handed the project to, lost his github repo access a few years after Satoshi left, he was basically the last person who still maintained that original vision for bitcoin. His and other attempts to increase the blocksize were made, such as bitcoin XT and bitcoin unlimited, each of which suffered their own forms of the above mentioned tactics, like severe DDOS attacks, censorship, blatant manipulation, etc. Bitcoin Cash was the 3rd major big block fork attempt, and was successful.

You may also be interested in reading the below post behind the refusal to increase the blocksize, real reason behind segwit, etc, from professor Stolfi:

[link2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/6ndfut/buttcoin_is_decentralized_in_5_nodes/dk9c27f/)

There's also a rather humorous but very poignant analogy about the entire thing, written by the guy who created the Electron Cash wallet (long time bitcoiner), which explains the situation well:

[link 3](https://hackernoon.com/chapter-one-alice-and-bob-9fa315aeef62)

&gt; I suppose it's possible that only a handful of people (those associated with Blockstream and r/bitcoin) can actually approve pull requests and simply... don't unless it fits their agenda

All you need to know about github: Try making an addition that goes against the Core narrative; Watch it fail.

&gt; And I suppose my next question would be, what's in place to prevent the same thing from happening with BCH?

Technically, nothing, although the difference is this time we are aware of the dangers of unfree discussion. The entire community basically recognizes the mistakes that were made (letting one person control all main communication channels, for example, or letting a for-profit company (Blockstream) have such a prominent place in development, as another). This whole thing would not have ever happened if open discussion were allowed, if ideas were allowed to stand in open air, and be scrutinized. You also have to remember even Satoshi said bitcoin or any system could not be immune to political problems, only that it would help possibly reduce things a bit.

&gt; Or any other crypto (or open source project) for that matter?

It already has with some coins. IOTA censors people, BitConnect coin duped people out of millions, Dash started (and may still be) as a scam (source: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBxbiH_Mg44).

"Wow, thank you for telling me that story, I think it helped clarify your perspective very well. I read back through your responses, and, to me, it seems like you see things almost as if you ARE an institution with billions at your disposal.  So much so that, if what you say is true, I would guess you are here in a professional context. 

That may be the source of our disagreement. I've got fairly well-defined monetary goals for myself... I know how much I would need to live out my life without needing more 'value,' and if you add a Lamborghini to that amount, it would still fit into the Miscellaneous Expenses budget of most investment firms. I look at the btc market cap as I look at an ocean; if you see it as a nice water feature in front of someone else's neighborhood, we're going to build our boats differently. I.e. you won't be building a boat.

For an institution, a gold ETF will be functionally the same as an equally valued brick of gold, but without the cost of storage. For an individual, there are events which would make the brick much more valuable: divorce, incarceration, identity theft, bankruptcy, etc. Being able to grab a thing which will help you survive for 6 months and put it in your pocket is value that doesn't exist for investment firms. The lower down the socio-economic ladder you go, the more valuable that kind of thing is. Your statement that ""So as long as you can convert your currency into something, you can hop around from any currency to any asset class pretty quickly"" is another example of something that is true to you, but is unimaginable to many. BTC is something that people who have never had the ability to 'convert their currency into another asset' have access to.

I don't have time to day trade or do proper research in all possible projects like this.  To be fair, some projects don't have a lot to research.

I think it's so early, we can all dabble in shitcoins for a year or two before the great culling occurs when the projects that have multiple use cases can eliminate the need for single purpose shitcoins and the ICO money is wasted/runs out and current weaknesses get catastrophically exposed.

Some projects have good ideas and good people, but they will just fail because they are bad at business.

The trilemma of crypto is decentralized, security, scalability. Only two can be had for the base layer. 

Energy consumption isn't a negative factor for Bitcoin. Mining profitability is heavily weighted toward lowerig energy costs than producing more hashes. So mining companies set up shop near energy production where they can't store 100% of the energy, and so Bitcoin mining uses the energy that was going to be wasted regardless. 

Again I don't want to discount any coins and be an ignorant Bitcoin maximalist. I like researching just in case there is actually a Bitcoin competitor. Right now I haven't really seen any. I just don't understand nanos advantage? It's feeless or so low in fees that in can, and should be spammed. If it was low and free then why not?

Case in point bitcoin has had a life span of almost 8 years yet failed to adopt its self as an every day currency. No human being can go to a Walmart and buy a product using his or bit coin wallet. So it failed. Ethereum only really achieved a dapp platform for other apps to build off of and nothing else. Saying tron has achieved nothing implies other coins have advAnced past the proto type stage. It implies a popular application or website is run off of x coins block chain technology.

"What is gold other than a shiny piece of metal? Of course, so long as there are humans who put a ton of value on shiny pieces of metal, it will be valuable. However, for critically minded individuals, gold is also only subjectively valuable. 

One can then counter by saying it has industrial applications, but other metals may be swappable for gold as well, so unless there are gold-exclusive properties (I’m not a material science major so don’t ask me) such that ONLY gold can be used for a specific task/function (I personally haven’t heard of any), you can’t say gold is so intrinsically valuable that it will, guaranteed, forever be strong enough to use a backup for a currency. 

Even if gold was/is used to backup fiat, if you think about it, the same thing could even be applied to crypto if it catches on. Humans just have to agree to it. Crypto, like anything, can be backed by anything, even if that something isn’t gold.

"Absolutely. I actually studied cryptos intensely circa ~2011 because I wanted to understand it as an investment opportunity in much greater depth and earlier than anyone else. I dusted out some very old C++ textbooks to relearn over half a year and took a 2 week bootcamp to design my own crypto. I called it ""LambShard"" because I remember feeling very proud that I was going that far above and beyond the rest of the street to really dig in, and feeling like absolute shit because I realized nothing I was doing in that room was remotely unique and I was just another sheep in that same room, seeing the same things and also easily the worst coder in the room.


I had the privilege of sitting down with Vitalik Buterin recently and trust me when I say I definitely agree with you when you say this space has some brilliant goddamn minds. And trust me when I say that where I allocate capital for investment purposes often is not perfectly correlated to my respect for the entity or people that run it. A company that makes paper mail envelopes (shit future) run by someone uses a brick phone and thinks technology is a fad (shit leader) but generates $200MM in free cash flow every year is still something I am going to be more than happy to buy for $500MM.

And to put it the other way, and don't take this personally, but there's lots of other burgeoning incredible disruptive fledgling industries that also have absolutely brilliant leaders and innovators pioneering potentially humanity-changing opportunities for whom I have tremendous respect for. Thorium reactors, green tech, CRISPR gene coding labs. But investing isn't about whether or not you like the story - it's about whether or not the numbers make sense. And as impressive and unique as cryptos are, it is just another one of many other stories that all are vying for attention and capital. The only difference is that you don't hear the frustration from these areas because they don't get the attention of masses of retail investors dreaming of becoming rich - and thus they get no media coverage.

But those guys could solve the entire energy puzzle. Or the aging puzzle. Or the ""are we trapped in the Milky Way"" puzzle. And cryptos, when you line it up with everything else, is just another boring ""exciting"" story.",1525397403

Even if the US dominance faded away kinda like the way the way UK and France did after the 19th century, the currency would still be very powerful (just like the GBP is still today). If the US really goes the way of Zimbabwe, I think there's a lot more to worry about at that point.",1525396945

"This goes pretty deep into trading theory, so I won't get into it (lots of good books on liquidity analysis if you are interested though). A common challenge for massive money managers is how they buy ownership of a company while moving the price as little as possible. However, it does happen, and it is very possible to buy the entirety of any asset with only a limited premium. You can see countless examples of major public companies that are bought out over a long period of ownership accumulation (typically done very very very quietly).

But two **major** warnings:

1) Bitcoin and an actual company are not comparable asset classes. Equities, over the long-term, grow organically. You can own 100% of a company without ever selling it to anyone and still gain wealth time due to that organic growth. Bitcoin (or gold) does not change organically. Owning 100% of it and never selling means you will never realize any form of gain. That's why Bitcoin is a commodity and not comparable to equities or fixed income.

2) In a rational market, the current price is the balance of a diverse set of views for what the asset is worth. This is why you can buy most of almost any publicly traded good in its entirety with a very limited premium (takeovers rarely happen at more than 50% or 100%). If the market suddenly thinks the value of the underlying is worth more just because it was worth more yesterday, you have a nonsensical feedback loop and that is the precise mechanic that causes a bubble to occur. This is also why most institutional investors would not put money into these assets because a massive amount is held by people who will instantly liquidate the moment it looks like the party is over.",1525395813

But there is at least the possibility that he is totally right and that if the unit price of BCH got very high, other competitors could come along and take market share from it. Or it could even be replaced in the future by some new tech, like a Hashgraph-style network or quantum computing alternatives.

He is at least currently still right that no crypto currently functions as ""money"" because you'd likely never use one as a unit of account for a set of books or a loan or an employment contract. And he is currently right that no crypto is quite as stable or as tested of a store of value as gold.

Gold, USD, option rights, etc. are all things that 99.9% of regular people will never really physically hold more than a tiny fraction of what they actually have a claim to, so I see very limited physical difference between them. If the end vision is BTC as a mainline means of exchange, it's going to be regulated, which also means that most people will let a third party manage their actual crypto because they will be secured by the government. The same reason why a regular person doesn't store his personal cash under his mattress, the average person in a crypto new world order is going to let some other party (most likely a bank) handle the logistics because the government will protect them if it goes under. Regular law abiding citizens don't want the hassle of carrying $100K in a suitcase to buy a car, and the same goes for having to deal with managing cryptos securely.



I have been following this topic (very casually) for half a decade now. But like dozens of other potentially disruptive technologies (green tech, thorium reactors, CRISPR) I have gone to conferences and taken meetings with the pioneers and leaders of these industries as it behooves oneself to track all these things during their infancy. And I am sorry that something which you clearly are very passionate about is something that I and many of my peers have deemed unworthy of institutional participation. But you have very fierce competition. There are many potential revolutions and technological frontiers today where people are building blueprints and visions that could solve the world's energy puzzle, or the genetics puzzle, or even our understanding of the very physics that keep us rooted to our galaxy... and they all are clawing to get the full backing of global capital allocators. Bitcoin and cryptos are indeed special and unique, but there are a lot of other special and unique things that also merit tremendous attention. Simply put, you don't hear the dispair of the leaders in these areas who are equally frustrated and determined to revolutionize humanity because they don't attract that masses of retail investors seeking to make their riches by just following the shiny light, and thus none of the media coverage. But we notice each and every one of you, and even if you might not see it in the self-absorbed suits with shiny rods up their rears, we hope just as much in our cores that all of you can succeed. Or at least some of us do. But our whole professional mindset is in trying to figure out why it will not work, and how it can go wrong. You guys are the dreamers and visionaries, and we are the ones trying to shit on the parade. But we are also the ones that manage your loved ones' pension funds. We're the ones that make sure our institutions of higher education have their endowments last for ages to come. And we have to figure out how to deploy a very limited amount of capital to get the most we can back. If you've ever been on either side of a local VC or angel committee, you'll know how difficult and heartless the system could be. If we could give everyone a few million to take their shot at whatever it was they were pitching, we would. But we can't. We need to bring the discipline so that the visionaries can focus just on the passion.



Anyway, if we're going to go into a deep nuanced discussion of crypto mechanics then I'm going to need to go pull out my notes from a long time ago. But to fully reconciliate what the two of us have said (and let me state for the record that your specification of 51% attack is the technically correct definition), you are going to need to take a long journey with me and my interpretation of this whole space. I have studied cryptos very carefully before, because that is the only way you can truly understand an investment. When this first came out in 2011 I took 2 weeks away from the office to participate in an grueling boot camp whereby each participant was guided in coding their own protocol. I spent 6 months before that relearning C++ syntax every night just so I would qualify. (And I am not too proud to admit that I often work 80 hour weeks but still squeezed out that time to sharpen up my coding even at the cost of my health because that's how much conviction I have in beating out everyone else in truely understanding investment opportunities.)


My understanding now is quite rusty from when this first came out. But there 3 general principles I know that are relevant here. The first one is that a network attack can be attempted by any single/collective entity that controls any proportion of the total network hash rate. Depending on the underlying protocol, there is a gradient function for the probability of success (muddied by countless other factors) and degree of control that you could accomplish that curves all the way up to 50%. So it's not a black-and-white flip a coin situation. The second one is that there is a myriad of designs that can be augmented into newer protocols (i.e. not Bitcoin) which would reduce the efficacy of such attacks. I would be lying if I said I can recall exactly how those mechanics could work, but I recall at the time there were two schools of thought at the time (2011), and one of them involved some sort of chronological marker beacon which would normalize against spontaneous spikes in total network hash rate and somehow redistribute/reweight the network. However, these countermeasures come at significant cost to the underlying efficiency and computational cost of maintaining the network.



The third one was from sitting down and talking much more recently with Vitalik Buterin (founder of Ethereum) where I was hoping to gain insight from someone who managed to walk into the already wild crypto scene and take it to a whole other level again. And one thing that he said stuck to me, and I don't fully understand/comprehend exactly why it was the case (and maybe you can help me) but here it is: Owning hash power, owning actual cryptocurrencies, and owning money will inevitably converge to be interchangeable. Energy, computation power, and wealth will boil down to be just another manifestation of value itself. And with that, the impact that cryptocurrencies will have on the fabric of society will be simultaneously change everything and nothing at once. We once demanded gold, we settled for gold-backed money (which were just government promises of gold), then non-gold backed money, and now entirely non-backed money... and soon we will see value as nothing but data itself. 51% computing power, 51% money, 51% whatever. Now, he's a very smart guy that had been drinking, and I was a much dumber guy that was also drinking, so I highly doubt I have captured the above too accurately. But going forward, that has been my interpretation of all forms of this topic.

If you read through my writing, you'll see why my personal biases align the way I see this. I view derivatives as being translatable to the underlying asset (with some discount/premium owed to uncertainty), which is why I take so strongly to the view that owning assets = computing power = money, as they are all just value itself. I see no difference between owning 51% shares of a company and having the power to take control and having the support of 51% of voteholders by proxy willing to back your activist plays. And, as technically inaccurate and inelegant as it may be, I draw that translation directly back to cryptos as well. Buterin told me that the biggest threat to a network would be someone who simply had the wallet to bankroll a takeover. That a network can fight a computing hash attack because everyone in that network will be willing to increase their individual hash contribution to fend off a hostile takeover and protect their own interests. Just like shareholders can fight off an activist that owns a 10% stake and wants to take a seat on the board of directors of a company. But none of us can fight if someone can simply bankroll 51% and deploy that capital (or resources as it was called) to force a strong-form seizure of entire control.



Where I simply disagreed was that no one in their right minds would want to put up that kind of capital. Buying up every share of Apple gives you 100% ownership of a fully functional, profitable and living entity. Buying up every modicum of a cryptocurrency gives you nothing. And no one is going to throw up billions for a strong-form 51% attack and risk ending up in that very situation. So you can try and hash your way into it, but even with Bitcoin (which I have said so many ""infant"" remarks about) the resilience of the network is probably infinitely strong such that you will not accomplish any of it without having billions to bully it into submission.



I am really enjoying these talks however. Bitcoin has become a very unpleasant discussion in almost every other form of interaction these days.",1525394915

Gold is a metal, and it conducts FAR better than most, because it has 2 6s-orbital electrons and 9 5d-orbital electrons to contribute to passing electrical current. The electron configuration is similar to copper (Cu), but gold's electrons are in higher shells, further from the nucleus, so they have less electrical attraction to the nucleus and are more easily available to participate in a current flow.

"With average intenret speed, each channel open can handle about 6 transactions per second. Then count the nunebr of channels. 
Lightning can handle an unlimited number of transactions per second, only limited by the number of users there are. Fortunately, the more users there are, the more channels there are, and the capacity automatically increases proportionally. Lightning Network it's not limited by proof of work, and not limited by how fast nodes can propagates the transaction. If you think about it, it's even better, because lightning Networks is directly peer to peer means the limitation aren't the nodes anymore, but the internet speed of the users. Lightning also lets you route 1btc through someone with 1 Satoshi now. Old implanentation sucked, but now, you can route any amount through any non-zero channel. Instant confirmation and the funds cont need to wait to be spent. If you send btc to someone, even if it's zero-conf, you can't use that immediately, and must wait for confirmations. With LN, you and I can send 1 Satoshi back and forth between each other 3-4 times per second with no fees. And I can send 1btc through 10 people for a 10 Satoshi fee. Not Satoshi per byte, but just 1 Satoshi per hop, period. 
And pruning doesn't work like that for everyone. It's still required that some nodes are able to verify from the Genesis block so that someone can't do a targeted attack on multiple nodes. And that requires you to have the entire chain. In order for a full node to verify the entire chain, it must be able to trace back every transaction, and because a block has every transaction to make up the hash, to verify, it needs the entire block. It means that no utxo can be used on a future block. You could do it by time, but it means after a few years your wallet expires if not used. 

Pruning requires you to have no more unconfirmed transaction output. ",1525391002

If its current market price is $100 per share, that $90 is extrinsic value and can disappear in a heartbeat because there is nothing actually backing that up.

The USD has **intrinsic** value because the US government is NOT going to stop backing it.  If you owe $100 in taxes, a $100 bill will always fulfill that debt.

Bitcoin has **extrinsic** value.  Sure, its selling for $9000 or so right now, but there is absolutely nothing backing that value and may just as well be worth $1.",1525390893

Ripple is centralized, so they cannot be compared. Stellar is dev owned. You have lol, Dash and then there's the actual competition in Nano. 


The thing Nano cannot claim is reliability. It has not proven or stood the test of time Litecoin has. Litecoin *is* secure. Nano is young, that's a fact. Who knows what can happen in Crypto. Even Bitcoin once had to fork out of necessity.

It is a normal evolutionary process to drop something that doesn't provide anything better and as BCH gets better Zconf and lower and lower fees the ""settlement"" becomes pretty much the currency.

The reason they are doing like this might be not technological, but regulatory, as BCH and BTC are seen as commodities in the financial industry (as opposed to ""platforms"" like ethereum), this seems to be a position consolidating worldwide and it is a reason to feel bullish AF. It is one step at a time and this big leap is now consolidating.

Next step is, once the market feels safe because they have a commodity to trade worldwide and with universal acceptance, people will jump in like crazy: selling cars, houses, businesses, etc, for BCH. Countries accepting it officially as legal deposit for a series of things, etc.",1525389770

"oh my bad I missed the node part.

I've always wondered about the centralization of nodes, it seems like a non issue to me. So the threat is that the blockchain will reach extremely large sizes, making it impossible for the average person to run a node?

By the time that happens, I am assuming other scaling solutions would be developed. I dont think anyone (who is not an idiot) wants to increase block size infinitely.  Increasing blocksizes is a great bandaid, while more robust scaling solutions are developed. 

Bitcoin could become extremely congested before these solutions can be deployed, hence why bigger blocks makes sense to me in the short-medium term. I think network congestion poses a much large threat than bigger blocks. If you need to pay a $100 avg txn fee (which can easily happen the next bull run), well it wont do bitcoin any favors, but it will sure give a lot of ammo to the anti-crypto people.

"To me the value of ltc, at least up until the latest crash, was just that it was part of the big trio - btc, eth, ltc.  They all rose at different times with different volatility, but roughly speaking they would all rise and fall with the market much more reliably than other coins.  So having a spread of the 3 ensured that you weren't at risk of one of them mooning when you're not holding it.  Basically, diversification of the 'surest' and safest crypto investments.    

The actual use case of ltc is to be the payments-centric complement to btc.  It's a vision that makes sense because bitcoin trades transactability for security so ltc is the less secure but more transactable complement, although ltc may not be the one to fulfill that role.  But that said, as I've said before, it's pretty hard to actually use crypto for anything thus far, so the only reason to buy for *most* people is as an investment.  So yeah, the fact that it's on coinbase and has ended up as one of the biggest coins is the reason to hold it.

You can use TA to some extent for upper and lower resistance levels because that involves human buying psychology which is a constant. But other than that you cant compare previous cycles in completely unrelated cycles to crypto. You just cant. This is a global 24-7 market with an almost equal mixture of institutional and retail investment. There is NOTHING to compare that to in history.

It wasn't advertised as Bitcoin Cash (BCH) because it was meant to be misleading.  No argument can be made that it literally wasn't a fraud.  That is why Bitcoin. Com immediately changed it back when the lawsuit was announced.  Swinging dicks can argue anything they like on Reddit, but in a civil courtcase black letter law applies and Roger Ver knew he would be crushed.

Once Ver backed off, the steam went out of the lawsuit.  I wouldn't have joined it even if i had of been suckered. Who wants a multi - year scrotum kick for a few thousand bucks sometime in the future?

Not me. I would have swallowed the lose and left crypto.

"So the best way to explain inflation is to ask you this:

Do you expect a raise in your salary this year?

Unless your an idiot I will assume yes.  And so will 99% of the people in the world. 

So what will your employer have to do in order to give you a raise?

3 ways 
1) see a rise in productivity (you do more)
2) raw materials costs decrease.
3) raises prices. 

So even if bitcoin was the “coin of the realm” prices would still have to rise.  Simply because the people in the economy will demand it. Instead of .025 and item will be .026 or .027.  You will pay these costs directly or indirectly. 

Inflation is irrespective of the underlying currency. The only way around it is if you are playing with exchange rates for underlying materials. But then there will be import fees and tariffs. 

The only other way is via current fed policy of changing interest rates to cool the economy down(costs rise for financing) 

Inflation is not always bad thing. For example in housing you buy a house in today’s dollars and pay for it with tomorrow’s inflated dollar. Making the house a cheaper purchase. 

Also, not sure how the under 40 comment is relevant.  Unless your making a point they are naive and don’t see the downsides. 

BTW-   The barrier to entry is very low. Bitcoin can be copied 100 times. (Just like any currency). If bitcoin gets too expensive, don’t you think people will flock to alternatives?

The Dnepropetrovsk maniacs (Ukrainian: Дніпропетровські маніяки, Russian: Днепропетровские маньяки) are Ukrainian serial killers responsible for a string of murders in Dnipropetrovsk in June and July 2007. The case gained additional notoriety because the killers made video recordings of some of the murders, with one of the videos leaking to the Internet. Two 19‑year-old locals, Viktor Sayenko (Ukrainian: Віктор Саєнко, Russian: Виктор Саенко) and Igor Suprunyuk (Ukrainian: Ігор Супрунюк, Russian: Игорь Супрунюк), were arrested and charged with 21 murders.

A third conspirator, Alexander Hanzha (Ukrainian: Олександр Ганжа, Russian: Александр Ганжа) was charged with two armed robberies that took place before the murder spree.

Thanks mate. Clearly I misunderstood the guy, when he explained why Monero is not using ASICs. 


It seems he argues that it's simply not a feasable strategy long-term to permanently rewrite Monero code to avoid ASICs. 



Since you seem to have a bigger understanding, I'll just ask you if I got this right about Hashrate. 


Hashrate is simply what secures the network, right? So many argue having 1000 hashpower is better in the network, than 100, because it takes a higher amount of hashpower to 51% attack the network.


The problem with ASICs being, that they're a centralized unit. So you may have more Hashpower, but not because you have more users, but simply better, but less, mashines. So more Hashpower, can also mean less security to the network. 



And the reason Bitcoin is not changing SHA256 to some ASIC resistant code is because ... Segwit and of course LN development. Because if they'd change that code, they'd automatically have to change everything, which is bad, because Bitcoin is already operating and shouldn't be changed or fucked with. 



Did I get that right this time? Thanks again for clearing this up. ",1525385859

I tried out blox - which is relatively new, it is shit. Has wallet and API sync but both don't work at all. I tried Stockfolio it works okay, but everything is manually and they don't support a lot of coins - which sucks. I basically tried everything and nothing works really well or requires a lot of attention to keep up to date. That's why I'm longing for a better solution. You saying ""there is already Blockfolio and Delta and they are better in every respect"" is just not true. It's in fact absolute bullshit. If you have a portfolio with three coins, they might be all you need. But if you have a portfolio that is heavily diversified and maybe run a trading bot to accumulate some more BTC or whatever they just won't do. You can't keep track of anything, expect of the rage you'll throw at these apps because you make one wrong entry and you can't even reverse it, although it was deducted from your BTC, so you have to put everything in again (this is a Delta situation).

Bitcoin: 
A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin/#selection-7.4-9.38)

&gt;Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non-reversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party.

&gt;What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party. Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers. In this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions. The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker node",1525385033

Had a visit from police after a cop helicopter flew over - they thought I was growing cannabis because in their infra-red my house was lit up like a Christmas tree. I went out with the dogs for a walk and came back to find 1 of my rigs proper on fire! Luckily the gpu's  was  all right!

I miss mining but don't do that so much now.

"FYI Jtoomim, this Response is typical of Core supporters, but there's some ways to handle it:

&gt; this is a pure propaganda project. the so called bitcoin dominance index is based on the market cap of shitcoins, which is a worthless metric as has been shown on various occasions in the past.

Solving:

1. Many times the claim is ""Dominance is decreasing because N coins is increasing.""  Thus, if at all possible, don't take the market cap of all 1,300 crypto-currencies.  Clamp the count to the top N coins for every datapoint - though this will be a lot more work.

2. The definition of shitcoin is vague enough to be controlling for some people, such as this guy.  If they define enough things as a shitcoin, the problem goes away.  Unfortunately I don't know of any good ways to eliminate the ACTUAL shitcoin data from the dataset, i.e. things like Paycoin, Bitconnect, etc, versus normal coins in real-time.

"This is a great idea but FYI this may not be as easy to tease out of the data as you think.  There's two problems:

1. Immediate market responses to high fees are almost exclusively due to traders shifting to altcoins for arbitrage.  This is most likely what started the crazy Ethereum flippening attempt in early 2017, clearly shown in [this excellent (but dated) graph.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DALFglbUMAAEre6.jpg:large)

2. The first mempool spike was particularly bad, yet the average fee only reached $5.5 per transaction at the peak.  Why?  Price was lower for one - under $2k per btc - but also because the software and businesses were wholly unprepared to deal with a sudden explosion of congestion.  Look at the fee distribution for May 19th, 2017.  153,000 pending transactions with between 120-140 sat/byte fees and only ~9k with 140+ sat/byte fees.  Why?  That's the highest most software would estimate fees at that time.  They needed to be updated with dynamic limits, and businesses/users had to change their behavior to remove low-value usecases.

3. A lot of the damage that is done from high fees [is very, very slow.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/7l6n63/the_problem_with_vers_position/drk4izl/)  It takes months or years for the damage to be evident.  The best examples I have of this without anecdote or time machine are [this Ethereum graph showing a dramatic increase in Ethereum use soon after BTC's backlog went ballistic](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactions-btc-eth-sma90.html#1y) - Which did not come back down after the backlogs let up as Core supporters would believe - And also [this graph here of BTC transactions](https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions?timespan=all&amp;daysAverageString=365) which has been smoothed out to such an extreme that at no point in Bitcoin's history was there ever a visible ***drop*** in transaction activity.  Until now.

"You missing A.I. as a sector on your list, which is going to explode in the coming years, and on top of that the token in my opinion one of the biggest sleepers is from the A.I sector, SingularityNet AGI token. 

Brief history, ICO was at $0.10, very strict KYC process thus the 20000 initial participants ended up being only 4000. Had $160million in pledges. Was one of if not the fastest ICO to sell out, gone in 60 seconds the full $36million. Day one and two of token release it shot up to just under $2.00 (2000%) straight in at top 100 around 80 I think, then the whole crypto market crashed, yes, it got released just at the wrong time I guess. 

Either way from the strict KYC to the token release timing of the market crash it has caused this token to somewhat be kept out of the light and in the hands of a few.

The humanoid robot they use for advertising Sophia has been shown numerous times on tv in interviews and is the first robot to ever receive citizenship, in Saudi Arabia. Done countless Interviews, ronaldo and many big celebrities, and has been a parody on Silicon Valley series alongside the CEO and Ben Geortzel.

I think this token is one of if not the most undervalued token right now and should have made your list.

A.I is the future and they have first mover advantage in the field of blockchain and A.i, with the best team imaginable in the field.

Time will tell if I'm right.

Good luck either way bud.

"Wikipedia: In economics, inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. When the price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation reflects a reduction in the purchasing power per unit of money – a loss of real value in the medium of exchange and unit of account within the economy.

So, consider this 3 arguments: 

Bitcoin has a fixed max supply known to everyone, 21million.
Bitcoin's production is being halved every 4 years. 
Bitcoin's popularity is raising everyday, almost anyone under the age of 40, that passes enough time on the internet has heard of BTC, and most of them will get on the boat by the next bubble.

Here's what I REALLY LACK to better trade crypto. Maybe it's been made already? I havn't seen it. Surely hedgefunds trading in crypto with APIs will by necessity follow these aspects:
- velocity up and down of alts compared to BTC (and maybe ETH, USTD). (looks like a RSI index of all crypto w the high velocity on top and low on bottom)
- visual chart showing volume representation of top alts compared over time (looking like 100 equalizer bands stacked on top)
- own portfolio over time total after each trade, and with parenthesis of every loss/gain at trades (looks like long horisontal candle chart with green/red for gains/loss and w figure)
- pump warnings (set alts or BTC in focus to a treshold of vol vs rate (in USDT) movement). This enables to track any unusual movement of vol or rate compared to the average

In a nutshell:

""After a hard fork: If fork was meant to start an altcoin, altcoin goes its separate way, branches coexist nicely

If fork reflected a fight over future of Bitcoin: branches fight for market share branches fight to be seen as ""the real Bitcoin"" probably one branch wins, the other melts away""

""If that's the case then the two branches are rivals. The branches will fight for market share...Each branch will try to get more merchants to accept it. Each branch will try to get more people to buy it...There is a public relations fight between them.""

1) on-chain is crazy expensive, so mining fees are 10,000 usd -&gt; btc is more secure
2) btc minng fees are 1,000 usd -&gt; equal security
3) btc mining fees (as you argued) are less than 1,000 usd -&gt; btc less secure..... But handles more tx cheaper.

The question with this argument is really, would you like your tx expenses to give you potentially near unlimited amount of tx (with LN), or would you rather pay a flat rate pr tx?

Remember, if you say that btc is less secure, that means you actually pay less in miner fees on btc.",1525378211

I'll address why I'm not addressing your 'blockchain' points in my next paragraph. Read it carefully, and please try to understand, I'm not the hand holding type, but you seem like you could do some good in this space, and I hate to see your enthusiasm go to waste over something so simple. So:

What is colloquially known as a 51% attack does not require the attacker to hold or control any bitcoin. I really want to draw your attention to your misunderstanding of this point, because it belies your ignorance of what bitcoin is. I haven't taken a single word you've said seriously since I saw that mistake in your thinking, and you explaining it further without doing a bit more research is borderline troll-y. A 51% attack is when an actor has so much computing power under his control (that he can re-write the blockchain. This attacker must solve a math problem faster than every other miner in the world. Then he has to do it again. And again. And again. And again. He's competing against many warehouses full of devices specifically designed to solve this type of math problem. If he's successful, he can re-write the blockchain to say that all btc have been sent to him. This immediately makes the front page of every newspaper and website in the world, and BTC is worthless. He's left with nothing but infamy. Game over.

Not understanding what this type of attack is, and not understanding what stops it from being feasible, means you do not understand bitcoin or blockchain. Again, please, please do some more research into this technology. 

I get how bond ladders work, I understand carried interest, I can read a 10K, I can design simple options strategies (though I don't know their names). I understand that world as well as I need to. THIS IS NOT THAT. Open your mind, look at the tech for a few weeks. I know a lot of the info seems dense and overly technical, but I promise: you can get it.

The parable of the blind men and an elephant originated in the ancient Indian subcontinent, from where it has been widely diffused. It is a story of a group of blind men, who have never come across an elephant before and who learn and conceptualize what the elephant is like by touching it. Each blind man feels a different part of the elephant body, but only one part, such as the side or the tusk. They then describe the elephant based on their partial experience and their descriptions are in complete disagreement on what an elephant is.

Everything?!  

The best help I can give you is a friendly warning:  
**Warning** - To all Conbase users, please, do not come back here to complain about Conbase, You were warned so many times to NOT use Conbase but you ignored. We are not here to clean their shit, please post your Conbase issues on r/FuckCoinbase or r/Coinbase.  
Coinbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of stakes.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA](http://archive.is/Prd01)) and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, ""share"" their personal data with ""3rd parties"" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**

Nope.

Well if you're going to get technical then you're both wrong. Since BTC moving from $1 to $87 would be a market cap of 17m to 1.48b while ETH from $1 to $15 would be a market cap from 99m to 1.48b which is clearly not equivalent.

"Lol shitcoin talker. Back to the same old argument. Its 2018, Satoshi is either dead or wants no part of this industry, either way long gone and preposterous to be stuck in the same rut of ""Satoshi's vision"". Satoshi gave us a brilliant concept, and since then things have progressed. New problems crept up, that never existed when Satoshi developed Bitcoin. Adding a dumb proposal like big fat blocks helps only when there are no transactions on the network, like it does for Bcash. And helps centralize mining even further. Why do you think developers who worked on the original Bitcoin code rejected such a terrible proposal? Because it only makes the network even more centralized. Bitcoin is as much P2P cash after Segwit and the fees are remarkably low. ""Digital Gold"" is such a nonsensical argument - Bitcoin appreciated in value, so lets ditch it and get a new one which has no value - thats what bcash's vision sounds like.

"Paraphrased a transcription:

IOST is a blockchain platform like ETH or ADA, the hardest but possibly biggest market for these coins right now, Jimmy has started a few companies in his past, went to Emory University in Georgia, USA. Got into Bitcoin because of his professor, he went to visit his professor's mining operation.

There will be numerous use cases for a blockchain platform. Wants to achieve full decentralization, and understands that scalability becomes one of the largest issues with that. Everything comes with a sacrifice, what they want to do when they launch their mainnet (he said by EOY or Q12019) they want to sacrifice less and achieve more.

He does not believe there will be one or two which dominates the market, like Apple or Android. In order to scale there are a few straight-forward solutions. Why is ETH slow? Or Bitcoin? They have many nodes, tens of thousands. In order for all these nodes to agree, you have to ask them each one by one. This is going to be slow. What EOS does, is a smart but brutal way. In order to make this fast, let's only have 21 super nodes. That will make it faster to reach a consensus, rather than tens of thousands of probably pretty slow machines. But with only 21, security can be a greater risk. Also, there is not really any innovation, it's more of a trick to reach consensus in a faster way, and is centralized. With only 21 super nodes, they will be allied up. Kind of like a few companies creating an oligopoly.

There are more difficult solutions, like Sharding. ETH has been trying this for over a year. It's all about partitioning and doing things in parallel. Instead of doing one by one, you split into 10 groups and running all 10 together, effectively increasing throughput by 10x. The problem here is you cannot have complicated smart contracts supported. If you have 10 groups doing things in parallel, things get confusing with data inconsistency and the groups get confused. No perfect solution to support smart contract.

In order to build a platform that can be launched in the next year or so, you need something practical that actually can be launched. In the past 10 years, the most successful blockchain projects are brutally straightforward. They are not complicated, no 200-page whitepapers, etc.

Their solution, PoB (Proof of Believability) is a variation of PoS but adds a layer of reputation on top of it. How does this help with scalability/decentralization? First, PoS has some problems. One is it can cause centralization. If I start with X tokens, and I stake them, I gain more tokens, which I can continue to re-stake, ad infinitum. This inevitably leads to centralization by several entities. For PoB, with the reputation layer, you cannot be powerful if you are rich but infamous, you'll need a good reputation too. In order to gain control, you would have to a) be rich and b) be reputable. So, reputation matters.

If there is one sentence to tell you what PoB is, then that would be... Say you have 20 tokens and I have 5, but you have a really shitty reputation and I have a terrific reputation, then I can actually get a higher chance of broadcasting a block than you.

This alone will help with centralization because you can have a lot to stake but actually have to do good things in order to become more powerful. Here is the brilliant part, because some people say if I'm rich, and I start to do one good thing, later on because my reputation is higher it can also cause centralization. For Jimmy, after you broadcast a block, or do something, within a certain time period they will actually (reduce?) reputation, meaning you must continually do good things. You can't just do one good thing and ride it.

PoB improves scalability significantly. Imagine you have 10,000 people, and many of the people (nodes) aren't really that active. Some people are fooling around, some have better connections, etc. For IOST, they do not actually have to reach a full consensus between 10,000 people. They can select say the top 10% which have a better reputation. In this way, as long as they get a fair selection of these people, and they also (reduce?) reputation occasionally, there are opportunities for new comers get a chance to become this top 10%. After you broadcast a transaction (I think he's saying amputated instead of reduced?) your reputation gets amputated and then you have to do good things again, you have to now either be a witness or other community service, so in this way they partition the network in a smarter way where they do not need to reach full consesus, making it faster and more secure. Even if they do not do Sharding in the future, this alone can provide a much higher throughput than ETH and achieving decentralization. They are confident they can have the whole thing figured out, with a higher level of decentralization and faster transactions.

""Information wants to be free"" is an expression that means that people should be able to access information freely. It is often used by technology activists to criticize laws that limit transparency and general access to information. People who criticize Intellectual Property law say the system of such government granted monopolies conflicts with the development of a public domain of information. The expression is often credited to Stewart Brand, who was recorded saying it at a hackers conference in 1984.

"&gt;My wishes were aligned with that majority that wanted progress, and I feel that small, vocal, twitter grupation forced their minority view onto us.

I'm afraid you have this upside down. The majority stood behind small blocks - I know I did, and I don't even have Twitter! 

If the majority really wanted big blocks, we'd have big blocks. If the majority really wanted big blocks, the majority would have been running big block consensus code - From businesses to miners to users - A Sybil attack of Twitter trolls would be dumb. That's how this consensus stuff works. I could well hire sockpuppets and shills to defend my own vision, but in the absence of economic activity, this is all fake. A baseless Sybil attack. If the majority of people wanted big blocks, BCH would be seeing way more txs than Bitcoin. But it doesn't. This is the truth, the majority did not want big blocks, or they would all have migrated by now.


The truth is that the opposite happened, the majority wanted small blocks, which is the software they were running. Not even all exchanges were openly supporting S2X or big blocks in general! And some businesses openly dropped out before the final breakdown of NYA. Basically the main NYA proponents realised there was **no consensus**, never mind ""controlling &gt;90% of all there is Bitcoin"". They certainly didn't control my full node.



I get that being in the minority sucks, but you just need to accept facts for what they are and get on with it. I don't like Trump president, but he's there, and no amount of witch hunting and conspiracies will get him out. The (to me sad) truth is that the majority wanted Trump (according to electoral rules).

"The pros of BCH are pretty obvious, being able to increase the blocksize at will, as long as miners are okay with low to no fees, means transactions can be practically free.

The idea that this can increase adoption is pretty solid, and if it weren't trying to conflate the names, it would be a pretty solid coin on it's own, maybe even overtake Bitcoin on it's merits and eventually achieve consensus and 'be' Bitcoin.

The fact that they aren't going this route is probably half 'not wanting to give up on their original plan', and half not believing in the coin as a standalone project, or thinking that allowing the existing Bitcoin to go unchallenged splits the market too much, so the benefits of killing Bitcoin and taking it's place are worth the risk of failing and drying up, or even killing both coins.  

Since people can't control the existing Bitcoin, they're better off making an attack than attempting their own route.  Plus, if they could 'take over' Bitcoin, they could promise/threaten/cajole the big miners in the way the BTC currently can, but I expect Roger has more profitable motives for it rather than the purportedly altruistic motive of the core team.",1525373580
"That's a pretty shitty view to take.

Bch has good fundamentals (value, distribution, hashrate, txps, etc) and one of the more active communities.

The fact is that bitcoin split into two conceptually different chains because developers (of the bitcoin core client) and a subset of users+services+miners decided to act counter to the NYA and the supermajority of support for sw2x.

One chain refused to scale via blocksize, and the other chose to scale primarily via that method. We could argue semantics all day about what's bitcoin and the pros/cons of each - but that's not my point. ",1525373564

BTW I think the whole 'cut ties with auditors' isn't nearly as shady as people make it out to be.  People forget that it's a nightmare for any crypto exchange or firm to consistently convert customer's funds to fiat.  Bitfinex froze fiat withdrawals for ages - not because they were shady, but because no banks were willing to work with them.  A lot of the time the banks don't even know they're dealing with crypto.  So if Tether is depositing and withdrawing huge amounts of fiat, it makes perfect sense that they wouldn't want a completely transparent audit, because their banking partners would instantly find out they're dealing with crypto and might pull the plug.  If I was Tether and spent tons of resources getting banking, and an auditing firm wasn't willing to release an audit without releasing everything, I'd cut ties with them too.",1525373169

"As the other guy said, there's nothing bad with BCH itself, it's the people trying to claim that BCH is 'Bitcoin'.  
BCH had, and still has, its chance to 'be' Bitcoin based on consensus and a longer chain (i don't know how that would work after this long, but conceptually I guess it's the same chain).  

The problem is, Ver insisted and basically gambled that the split, and resulting 'better' code would have such obvious benefits that all processing would shift over to BCH, they would have the longer chain, and BCH would legitimately be Bitcoin.   When that didn't happen, that crew basically tried insisting that BCH is still Bitcoin based on their insistence that the code is better, even though it didn't achieve consensus.  Since the 'brand' of Bitcoin, it's market visibility and pretty much everything about the name 'Bitcoin' is more popular, and since he somehow controls some popular (centralized) marketing mechanisms for the word 'Bitcoin', it's more profitable for him to push 'Bitcoin' users (especially new ones that don't know any better) to Bitcoin Cash.  It's basically far more profitable, and a better gamble for him in general, to ignore consensus, use his resources to bolster Bitcoin Cash, and take whatever he can get out of it.  It he decides it's a losing battle, he'll know when to get out before everyone else (just like he literally admitted to doing when getting 'into' it right when/before coinbase started listing it) and he will be no worse off for having 'passionately advocated for what he believed in', just like he 'passionately advocated for BTC' before he got frustrated that he couldn't control it with his passion and business skills/con-ish behavior.

"My basic understanding is that updates to Bitcoin's code are based on a ""consensus"" over on r/bitcoin (and the bitcoin community?). Through censorship, gas lighting, and other forms of manipulation, a small handful of people were able to control the direction of bitcoin's future while maintaining the guise of it being a community based system.

My question is, how can a small group control the direction of an open source project with &gt;500 contributors? I wanted to see if I could determine who had what access in the repo, but determining collaborators and their permission level requires you [to be a collaborator with an access token](https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/collaborators). I suppose it's possible that only a handful of people (those associated with Blockstream and r/bitcoin) can actually approve pull requests and simply... don't unless it fits their agenda?

And I suppose my next question would be, what's in place to prevent the same thing from happening with BCH? Or any other crypto (or open source project) for that matter?",1525372126

"Lol Bitcoin has been working 24/7 since it started so you're making shit up.  

Btrash couldn't even get started because your incompetent devs can't do a difficulty adjustment and you couldn't claim enough hash power.

Oh no Bitcoin got a little expensive during its growing pains.  

Lightning has been working. 

The fact that btrash didn't have enough miner support to mine and they needed to adjust the difficulty twice to get the altcoin chain alive is shameful enough.

However the fact that there was enough miner support to bring your abandoned chain back alive as a joke speaks volumes.

Here is the difference between Bitcoin and bcash.  Bitcoin devs are open to reasonable blocksize increases.  Segwit is evidence of this it's a blocksize increase which fixes malleability paving the way for better smart contracts and renders covert asicboost obselete.  Pretty fair compromise.

Bitcoin devs are open to various scaling approaches because it's required to keep Bitcoin controlled by no one.  Bcash devs are a one trick pony.

Right now the only way any crypto is useable by the general public is if the coin is held and managed by a central authority who can keep things 'safe' and provide at least some cushion or guarantee if things go bad.  The 'safety' isn't worth the loss of freedom, and completely kills the idea behind crypto in general, so while everyone seems to be anxious for crypto to 'go mainstream', everyone is missing the point that we don't really need another convenient peer to peer payment system...centralized versions of those already exist...we need a platform that isn't ready yet.",1525372032

Crypto is exactly this, but amplified.

"Bitcoin Core is the reference implamantation. Bitcoin Cash's implamentation is called ""Bitcoin ABC"". This means that if you call Bitcoin ""Bitcoin Core"", it means I get to call Bitcoin Cash ""Bitcoin ABC"". Since Bitcoin ABC is literally the code ripped from Bitcoin Core repository. (Do a delta scan, there are about 14 lines of code that are different, meaning Bitcoin Cash is just Bitcoin ABC, which is Bitcoin Core). Bitcoin Cash should be called Bitcoin ABC, if Bitcoin should be called Bitcoin Core. That also means the Internet/TC/IP protocol should be called ""Google Chrome Internet"" because it's the most popular browser, just like Bitcoin ABC is the most popular BCH client, and Core is the most popular Bitcoin client.


The only reason why you should use ""Bitcoin Core"" is either that you are an idiot and don't know what it means, and use it because of your cult, or because you also call Bitcoin Cash ""Bitcoin ABC"".

"If you have time, you should take a look. Here's a brief description:

- Bridge between Crypto and Wall Street. While I agree this is a broad statement, they will allow for brokers and managers to trade on MT4 and MT5 (initially) all sorts of instruments including crypto, forex, stocks, metal, etc...

- all transactions will be on the blockchain (it is currently an ERC20 but they mentioned they could change blockchain should transaction speed become an issue) and the history will be posted at the end of every trading period (thereby protecting a manager's trading strategy). Immutability and transparency of the trading history will allow investors to make informed decisions. 

The token itself (GVT), will be used to purchase manager tokens on the platform. These manager tokens will be tradeable on an internal exchange giving the investor the option to access their funds before the trading period is over. 

- alpha was just released in demo mode. The live mode will allow for metal, crypto, forex and 4 more trading instruments.

- they announced last month the development of their own crypto broker called Genesis Markets. It is set to be released in the next few weeks (allowing greater liquidity for their managers). GM will be available to everyone. The token itself will allow GVT holders to get anywhere from 30 to 100% off any transaction fees depending on their bags.

That's how modern central banks have worked and world economies as a whole have done nothing but grow over the last century. I don't know if we can actually make an economy work with currency working both as a means of exchange and a saving instrument but I haven't studied those kinds of economic theories to even have an opinion. It's also not something specific to Bitcoin. You can apply the same economic policies in a traditional fiat currency economy by adjusting the central bank policy.

"You do know that blockchain escrow company has already completed an escrow transaction?

https://hackernoon.com/how-a-smart-contract-replaced-an-escrow-company-in-a-60k-deal-551ff7839044

Every transaction dealing with escrow is checked and double check by multiple eyes in the real world. The blockchain works as a validation of a transaction that can only take place once terms are agreed upon and have been set. So your logic that people will be making transaction they didn’t mean to is null and void because it wouldn't be by accident it would have happen by negligence between the two parties. 

The concern is still their but, what about banks and governments who ”misplace” money without a viable ledger to track its movements? That money is gone but if you send something to someone you know where it went because of a public ledger. 

Crypto might be a fad to some but but it’s the technology that stems from this period that is revolutionary and should not be overlooked. It’s the potential technology that is being valued. ",1525370296

"&gt; It's just not right for a single party, to hold all of the hashrate.

Exactly. ASICs are used in Bitcoin and no one party holds all the power, despite ASICs being used. That's because the network has matured. 

If it wasn't for ASICs in Bitcoin, we'd be looking at way higher transactions costs than we look at currently. 


See Monero for instance. Did you know that a transaction costs between 1-2$ currently? That's a price people pay, for privacy, Nethertheless, it's a pretty high fee isn't it? That's because their network is used for payments, but only has GX cards to support and hold their network. 


The devs are aware and said, that it will simply be a matter of time, when they will also ASICs to run, just currently they refuse, because the network is not mature enough. 

ASICs are just better than GPUs for PoW mining, that's the truth. 



People argue that GFX can be used for other things, which is a super stupid argument that entirely misses the point. XMR miners, with 20 Radeon cards, never use these cards to play games, or to do anything else. They use these cards to mine, that's the truth. Essentially a wasted product. 


When they could also mine higher hashrate, secure the network better with ASICs. And eventually they will support ASICs with Monero too, as soon as the network matured. 


Bitmain sees competition from every direction. Whether it's Halong, or potential new competitors, eventually competition will be there and Bitmain will no longer be the number 1 player alone. When that point has reached, it will simply be safe to use ASICs, even for shitcoins like my Monero.

"&gt;Neither Debian nor Ubuntu are Linux.

False. If it is a distribution of linux then it is linux. That's like saying the USD is not a currency because its just a 'distribution' (or in this case more appropriately, an 'instance') of a currency. In programming, any object that inherits from a base class is BY DEFINITION an implementation of that base class i.e. it IS that base class for all intents an purposes and can even be referred to by its base class' reference in static and polymorphic calls.

&gt;They are not Linux itself. Linux is not an operating system. It is a system kernel. Linux distributions are operating systems that are made on top of the Linux kernel. If you were to say that Debian is Linux, you might as well say that Debian is Xorg.

This is a separate discussion from what we're talking about here.

Wiki:
&gt;The Free Software Foundation uses the name GNU/Linux to refer to the operating system family, as well as specific distributions, **to emphasize that most Linux distributions are not just the Linux kernel**, and that they have in common not only the kernel, but also numerous utilities and libraries, a large proportion of which are from the GNU project.

So that's one thing. But Debian and Ubuntu are unquestionably both Linux, I don't think you'll find anyone who is not trying to avoid a mentally-painful conclusion that would contend that neither of those are 'Linux'. If Ubuntu isn't Linux then what the hell is? So clearly you're talking a nonsense here.

&gt;If you were to say that Debian is Linux, you might as well say that Debian is Xorg.

What are you talking about? Xorg is a cross-platform display server, Debian is Linux distro the two cannot be remotely compared. But Debian and Ubuntu are the same thing with relatively minor changes. They are both Linux. BTC and BCH are BOTH **implementations** of a protocol/standard. As  programmer, I find it hard to understand how such a clear concept has been lost on the majority of this space.",1525369951

"Satoshi!

That's why there wasn't ever a max block size in the design. It's never talked about in the white paper at all.

It was added to prevent a specific type of spam that isn't even possible anymore. 

Now that actual transactions have filled the blocks to this max it will be removed. 

It's an artificial bottleneck that was always meant to be temporary. 

That's why there's the satoshi quote about how the bitcoin protocol never reaches a scaling limit.

BTC solves the first two, iota and nano 1st (or at least when coordinator is shut of) and 3rd. I know everyone keeps pointing on ""its not been proven unsafe"". But still guys, no matter how you argue, when something requires less computing power it will always be more secure than an equally advanced more computing heavy hash algorithm. I don't think this will ever be solved, thus my opinion: it is not as safe as BTC, but maybe safe enough for small transactions (machine level). Maybe I see a future where I have a super safe currency for large transaction (car payment, house, etc.) and one for daily use (IOTA, Nano, etc.). U think?",1525369700

"&gt; Is girl a virgin if she only had oral sex?

No. Sex is the bar. It doesn't matter the form of sex.

&gt;Virginity used to equal innocence

It still does. That's why sex is the bar.

&gt;Is she a virgin if she is spoiled from porn?

In a strictly technical sense she is physically a virgin. Psychologically, she's not. This is why we can't only measure things by how physical they are.

&gt;Virginity is a compelx abstraction that is used to communicate specific things between humans.

Exactly. If it was only about something physical there would be nothing complex about it. Hymen: virgin, None: not. Simple. The truth is it's not that simple as you seem to agree.

&gt;I'm interested in your legal perspective. How to protect copyright in the presence of Bitcoin?

I'm NOT in favor of copyright laws. The problem is laws inherently mean use of *force*. But as I said force is the defining line of ethics in the first place. That means if you get laws wrong you're basically behaving unethically. We've been debating this for hours and neither seems to have made much headway. The problem is it's a complex topic that borders on philosophy and abstraction. One can't easily define the truth one way or another. I think my rationale more closely resembles what we should strive for and expect as humans trying to behave fairly and ethically towards one another. However, I respect that there are fair points others (like yourself) may disagree with. That's why my philosophy when it comes to establishing law is when in doubt DON'T MAKE A FUCKING LAW. Err on the side of inaction. It's too easy to screw up and then nearly impossible to reverse. The more complicated the decision the more local should be the decision maker. So when it comes to copyright I believe morally a person should refrain from using a work of art created, and I believed owned and controlled by the creator, without their consent. But I leave it at that. It's each individual's choice. ",1525369033

My original point still stand. I'm sure the banks are not happy that, to pick even one individual to avoid your obsession with market cap - one the Winklevosses or Tim Draper, say - that his/their assets are not being stored in a bank instead.",1525368639

"Meni, you need to learn a thing or two about freedom. The bitcoin-btc branch offers less freedom is every area of it's domain. 

""Changes require consensus"" translates to no more changes for Bitcoin-BTC unless there is 99,9% concensus on them or miners are fooled again by empty promises

""Development &amp; Testing should be done rigorously and carefully"" translates in to a select group of bitcoin-btc devs that decide that for all the rest

""Soft forks are preferred to hard forks. And HFs should have a long lead time."" translates in to that fooling of the miners because soft fork and hard forks in the long run are the same,[ see this post.](https://np.reddit.com/r/bitcoin_uncensored/comments/3hj2sl/soft_fork_hard_fork/) 

""People should be able to run nodes."" I could run a node right now but I don't have to so I don't. Miners HAVE to run nodes. Big businesses have to run nodes. Users don't. The user  experience is very important and if the bitcoin-btc people have a different opinion then that will just mean bitcoin cash will become way more succesfull. 

If you claim that I am not safe using a SPV client like Electron Cash then I challenge anybody to steal from SPV users, you would create quite the ruckus if you are able to pull that off.

"No. Every noob that makes a Coinbase account sees bitcoin cash presented as equal and legitimized. If it wasn't being actively supported like that, you'd be right. However, the opposite is true, BCH is being sold and promoted to noobs, people coming into crypto unsure of up from down, people easy to con. Jokes and serious rhetoric against BCH are needed to help educate people so they don't end up on the wrong chain, or accidentally send their new coins to the wrong type of address...

The block size debate is years and years of civil war around here. It's not just going to go 'poof' if we stay quiet about it. ",1525368463
"Let me give you a real answer instead of some of these other comments I'm seeing.
1. First off, the crypto space is in its baby stage. This is the time to ""get rich quick"" as we see a bubble just starting to form (and no it's not close to popping and I'll explain why in a second). With this baby stage in mind, peer-to-peer irreversible transactions are all we have. Just like we didn't have the lightening chain network and everyone doubted that Bitcoin would keep up to scalability. These problems need to be dealt with in order, or else the whole system will fail. 
2. Let me give you a fact most people won't agree with but I'm almost certain of. 99% of the crypto currencies we are investing in (including the bigger ones like Ethereum, Tron, Cardano, Stellar, Ripple, etc.) are going to fail within the next 5-10 years. The reason is because we haven't hit institutionalized investment yet. Every coin is scrambling to make their product first, not the best. Imagine what happens when in the next 2-3 years institutionalized investment comes in and decides to do what Ethereum does, but does it 10x better because they don't even need funding. Their sole purpose will be to take over that coin in our market. It's going to happen, whether we like it or not. I guarantee it. 
3. Goes off of my first point. We need to get to second and third-generation cryptocurrency coins to have real-case use. Look at Po.et. That's a coin that's solving a problem that isn't too complicated, and I have a feeling they're going to be successful in the long-run based on their intentions (not shilling them just pointing out an example).
4. The bubble has barely even started. Take a look at the dot.com bubble, which was primarily a North American phenomenon.  The market was inflated by $3-$5 TRILLION dollars, and that's without the ease of access we'll be seeing this year with cryptocurrency. Crypto will soon be easier to buy than ever, and we already have a $4.5 billion market cap. It's also a global phenomenon in an industry where these coins could potentially have real value and not just a speculative price. That's huge. I have a strong feeling we're going over at the very least $5 trillion before the bubble inflates too much and pops. 
5. I hope my arguments make sense to you. Agree to disagree if not, but I hope you understand that there is insane potential here because of how early in the game we're in. Losing money sucks, but you still have plenty of time to learn and make your money back (if not, more). I can't see this volatile market going anywhere for at least 2-3 years. ",1525368437
"Why did I laugh? I guess because of the hostility between the two camps.

 I saw this picture of the clue yesterday and of course I knew it was bitcoin. I think the way the comic played of what I had preconceived as the answer and flipped it around was funny.",1525368434
"I do agree that you cannot put a market cap on a currency, or you can but you would have to compare it to other currencies like the dollar, and not to companies. I was thinking about the fact that a lot of cryptos are not actual currencies, but tokens which are more alike to shares rather than to actual coins.  If you think about how ICOs function, the tokens are de facto shares.

And hmm yes, cryptos are priced at what people think they may be worth in the future. I am making a case here that people are wrong, because unlike Tesla or Amazon, very few cryptos have business models that would actually enable them to reach those market caps in the future. Yes, I suppose this can be debated.

Maybe I'm wrong, time will tell, but I'm not really seeing a lot of good business models in crypto, to actually attain those market caps in the future.",1525368418

"**Faulty generalization**

A faulty generalization is a conclusion about all or many instances of a phenomenon that has been reached on the basis of just one or just a few instances of that phenomenon. It is an example of jumping to conclusions. For example, we may generalize about all people, or all members of a group, based on what we know about just one or just a few people. If we meet an angry person from a given country X, we may suspect that most people in country X are often angry.

This kind of post is necessary in this  sub every once in a while. We need to realize that crypto has a long way to go still, and these points can be used to help find projects that actually are working towards solving the problems regarding adoption, UI/UX, and building real business use cases. Many, many, crypto projects will crash and burn. The goal is to hold on to the ones that deliver.

There are some that I believe can achievee this (VeChain, I’m biased) but it will take time and they’re no guarantees. I was lucky to buy in early; and sell most at the peak, and I still hold crypto that I treat as a portion of my overall investment portfolio.

"Hi theruylopez - thank you for your thoughts - I always like a healthy discussion.  While you make some great points you are attempting to measure the value of the market at a snapshot in time.  These prices, like most, are based off of speculation of what future price will be.  That being said it makes it even more complex as there are multiple types of Crypto-Assets to which you are trying to compare to a fortune 500 company.  Some of these crypto-assets will be revenue generating companies (some already do today) and some are in the process of building their platforms which will generate revenue in the future.  Others, mostly any currency, cannot be compared to fortune 500 companies today because it is like comparing apples to oranges.  Putting a 'market cap' on a currency and comparing it to a revenue generating company will technically always fail.  

To your comparison of speculative prices lets take Amazon as an example.....until only a few years ago they were not profitable yet they were valued at hundreds of billions of dollars.  Tesla - in a similar situation - is priced at what people think it may be worth in the future....not what it is today.  We must shift our minds to start accepting how the future of our economic ecosystem is evolving.....the idea that UBER does own one car yet is the largest transportation company in the world is hard to accept.  In the same situation is AirBnB - the worlds largest  hotel does not own one building. Same goes for any other new-age company such as WeWork and others.  Open up your mind brother.",1525367646

"&gt;What about that NANO hasnt been tested at all.

It's been tested on the testnet at 7000tps - though that won't still be accurate with the new Universal Blocks  
- A security audit is part of the roadmap

&gt; I want to see what happens when an old btc farm start precomputing NANO-txs and spam the network for a week. Let's see how all the nodes will handle that?

We know that that consumer hardware takes around 2s to compute PoW. If the 7000tps still applies, then the attacker must spend 14000 seconds (4 hours) for each second that the network is overwhelmed. So if the attacker dedicated a week to generating precomputed blocks,  and then broadcast them all at the same time,  they could stop the network dead for about 43s.  
If they dedicated a year to it, they could stop the network for 37 minutes. Given that this is still less than the usual Bitcoin ""6 confirmations"" time, I still don't care. 

Maybe the attacker deliberately generates double-spend blocks instead of valid ones, and maybe this takes more work to vote on.  
I0t's fair that we do need to test that, in case it takes longer than a single Bitcoin payment to process.

&gt; What also concerns me is the decentralization part of NANO. Currently the dev-reps have &gt;50% of all the voting power (thats already bad). How do you solve this problem? Having a list of reps people choose from online? Setting it randomly in a NANO wallet? Who decides what reps are accepted to that list?  

I fully agree that we do need to decentralize Reps.  
It's a decision for each wallet holder.  The decision making is itself completely decentralized, even if the current outcome isn't.  
It's definitely not appropriate to randomly-assign Reps since that risks a Sybil attack.   
The current state exists because when Nano was launched _there were only the Dev nodes_ to choose from. As other users and exchanges like Nanex adopt online wallets, people have options to choose from that weren't there even a month ago. It's already changed a lot in the last month.

&gt;Running your own as rep is not the best option, because a node has to be online 24/7.  
A Representative is... your Representative. That's the point. If your node is online 24/7 you don't need a Representative.  

&gt;What happens if your chosen rep-node goes offline?   
Nothing happens. Your votes are not counted.   

(Any node can see when any other node last voted. Perhaps someone will create a helpful app to send an alert when the chosen Rep has not voted for a certain period of time. Or perhaps that could become an alert in future wallets.)


&gt;precomputed 'tx-attacks' on specific rep-nodes to 'knock' them out (get out of sync) so they wont vote  

All transactions are handled identically so it's not really possible to ""tx-attack"" a node.  

If you're sending a Dev node money with each transaction it might take more time to process it (but welcome the free gift.)    
A node option already exists to ignore transactions below a configurable amount.  

A normal DDOS attack is more likely.  
But a Nano Address is not an IP Address, and can be running anywhere, so DDOS is not easy. ",1525366521

Are whales and institutional investors the same thing? Yes and no. There are several whales who bought large volumes of Bitcoin in its infant days and scored big. The Winklevoss twins are the perfect example of this. There are many whales who aren’t as savvy as you’d expect; they just own a lot of Bitcoin. They don’t have any connection to corporations and institutional investors like hedge fund managers, investment banks, mutual funds etc. This is what separates the typical notion of whales with institutional investors. They share many similarities and institutional investors can become whales but whales typically do not become institutional investors. Whales have been around since the beginning, institutional investors are new to BTC. When institutional investors fully mobilize with Bitcoin, we will see its largest gains ever because Bitcoin will finally have a keen sense of legitimacy. However, even today, Bitcoin is still being questioned and associated with labels like “pyramid scheme”, “black market”and “money laundering.” This is the biggest challenge for Bitcoin (and definitely not mining or hashrate as you unnecessarily brought up). Bitcoin was founded as an alternative to the greedy practices of banks and investment managers like Goldman Sachs, but it’s still perceived to be a get rich quick scheme.

Institutional investors will help bring credence to this asset class (the irony being that institutional investors are very shady people). Your remark about HODLers wasn’t necessary.

"Yes I am aware of all that, that's why I changed the example from a fiat exchange to a crypto one. And yes, it's an unknown, but I look at it this way: if things do not continue to move in that direction, then crypto as a whole will have failed because the entire point of its creation was to eschew censorship. Without that there are no other use cases that can't be handled just fine by fiat and regular old databases. 

If crypto is ultimately to overtake fiat in economic terms, then the majority will have no reason to submit to any government demands because their assets will be unconfiscatable. Only to those still dealing in fiat will regulations have any teeth at all, and at that point it might not be worth enough for anyone to even care anymore.",1525365809

* Interactive charts with **MACD, RSI**, **Ichimoku**, **Moving Averages**, **Stochastic**, **TD Sequential**, and **Pivot Points**
* **Indicator alert** on any coin: Recurring alerts whenever indicators such as **MACD**, **RSI**, and **Ichimoku** indicate buy or Sell 
* **Limit** and **Delta** alerts on **price**, **market cap**, or **volume** for every coin
* Total Market: Delta or limit alert on **total cryptocurrency market cap**
* Personalize alerts by adding **emojis** to them: 🚀🌙
* Coin tracking. True gain/loss calculation. Profit and diversity charts. CSV File import.


The app is published by a small startup company in California, USA, which I am part of. It doesn't access any of your files, passwords, or contact list. Every version is reviewed by Apple and Google before being published on App store. It doesn't run in background, and it requires minimum permissions.

No, it [really can't](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffreydorfman/2016/08/19/inflation-is-still-bad-for-the-economy/). Somewhere around the 200%-250% debt-to-GDP ratio things go all Zimbabwe/Venezuela/Weimar Republic. If you're lucky, maybe you can pull a Japan and lose [twenty years of productivity](https://www.thebalance.com/japan-s-lost-decade-brief-history-and-lessons-1979056) in a deflationary cycle. 


Money printing (quantitative easing, competitive devaluation, currency wars) [increases wealth disparity](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonhartley/2015/06/25/how-federal-reserve-quantitative-easing-expanded-wealth-inequality/) because the [65% of Americans](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2016/01/06/63-of-americans-dont-have-enough-savings-to-cover-a-500-emergency/) that live paycheck to paycheck can't purchase stocks, bonds or anything that rises with inflation. 


Countries have two options: default on the debt or destroy the value of the currency. Right now, the US is hanging in there because it's destroying the value of USD slowly, hoping nobody notices, and they're able to outsource inflation to other countries (somewhat) due to being a reserve currency other countries use to stabilize their crappier currency.

Today is an exciting day as we roll out our beta and will soon be rolling out our new site. 

To give more context, Pei is a mobile application that allows you to link any debit or credit card to earn cashback from over 5,500 brands. Cashback is automatically given and does not require you to change how you spend in any way. You simply swipe your cards at those locations as usual and we will return you the cashback rebate to your account. 
The best part? That cashback can be withdrawn in Bitcoin! Crypto is inevitably the currency of the future, and Pei wants to get us there faster. 

Thank you all again for the support! ",1525363336

You can already buy bottles of wine that has VeChain integrated, scan and verify they are real. They’ve had a live working blockchain since 2015 in fact.

I’ve seen WTC has a subsidiary which has applied and joined the Alibaba alliance. I wouldn’t call any of that a strong tie. And even so, this would be about the only tie that I could see, compared to VeChain’s multiple ties (PwC, Michigan State, they already provide food traceability to one of Asia’s biggest grocery stores and biggest wine manufacturers).

We can agree to disagree; and I appreciate your level headed response and actually providing reasons. I honestly agree that it’s most likely developed in house, in conjunction with multiple crypto projects (WTC &amp; VET), as it will require cross-chain tx’s.

Also, as an improvement upon the current system, if you simply want to store funds with minimal risk, you can just hold your own crypto. If you try and do this with fiat every year you have a bit less purchasing power — punishing those who save, and discouraging it. ",1525362101
"Sure it's suspicious, but that's not enough for me to state theory as fact. 

And my libertarian ideals have nothing to do with the reality of the situation. I could be a communist and what I said would still be true. If anything, my statement was an endorsement of government if you accept that insider trading should be illegal. 

Most people might consider it less than ethical, but preventable it's not unless you have a central authority with the ability to take back unethically acquired profits, which is exactly what Bitcoin circumvents. The US government can hurt Coinbase on the fiat side because it's business model is built around trying to walk the regulatory tightrope, but once that fiat is in the crypto economy, if an exchange like Binance tried something similar it could easily tell any and all regulators to pound sand.",1525362089

"Wait, what is your definition of “off chain solution”? In every context i’ve ever read it has meant a solution for the problem of scaling.

Do you just mean BCH has spawned some interesting sites/services/merchant integrations that make use of BCH on chain tx? If that’s the case then i agree with you, but that doesn’t have anything to do with with OP; BTC has had many more such integrations (though maybe not in as small a time).",1525362077

"Horrible call dude. Your site describes a shitcoin as one that has no value. You may very well disagree with BCH, you may disagree with bitcoin.com's reference to 'bitcoin core' - but you are pegging a 'fraud' lable to something that you disagree with. You've taken the #4 coin by market cap (2nd largest by accumulated POW) and compared it to a ponzi scheme (bitconnect)....my god you don't even label Ethereum Classic as a shitcoin?
BCH is massively growing in merchant adoption, and massively growing in use cases (e.g memo.cash).

To your 'but bitcoin.com is intentionally adding confusion' argument:
Let's consider I, Robert, create a website called ""USdollars.com"". Great, and when you go to ""buy.usdollars.com"" I offer that you can buy ""fakecoins"" or ""realcoins"". When you purchase fakecoins I sent you physical dimes and nickles, but when you buy realcoins really I just sold you some bitcoin (BTC). 
You could get upset with me over that, some people would, I might get sued. 

Now - according to your logic, coincall should lable BTC a shitcoin because I (an individual) am ""intentionally trying to confuse the community by taking over usdollar.com, @usdollar twitter handle and much more""

So what is coincall guilty of? Continuing to fuel this religious battle instead of just allowing the market be the market",1525362050
It's funny because when I read the whitepaper it describes the functioning of Bitcoin AKA Bitcoin Cash. Now do you have a whitepaper that describes how a congested settlement system is supposed to work? I'm interested to learn more about it.,1525362040
"Core did not sabotage BTC. They sabotaged *your vision* of BTC.

BTC is alive and well, and is now full of people believing in a non-censorable and decentralized  coin. To the point we are willing to accept that fast and cheap can not be guaranteed on chain.

Sure, we all wish Moore's law was unlimited.

It never was. ",1525362015
"I grew up in the 90s, so I always envied people who were BBSing in the 80s with Commodore 64s and PC Jrs, and loathed to relive that somehow. I feel like Bitcoin gave me a second chance to do that in 2009... I felt like a pioneer on a ship sailing new seas, and the experience was amazing. ",1525361994
"In the case of Mr Ver, it is a poorly defined political label that enables him to do as he pleases without feeling any shame.  

Closely related to libertarianism - the capitalist form is close to crypto-anarchy.

Head over to r/btc.  They *ought* to understand what you mean, but are actually thick as shit.",1525361987
"Anyone that doesn't get the hype :

Imagine Ethereum just announced they'd figured out how to make their blockchain feeless and infinitely scalable.

Now you'd have unlimited feeless smart contracts.

Try persuading me that would not be HUGE for the whole of crypto. It would break the space. Everyone would be going crazy.

IOTA have just announced that they have done that, but just in a different order. ",1525361981

"A few countries will be reluctant to give up their newly gained complete overview of all transactions that has occurred with the mass adoption of c.cards and the fall off in use of physical cash.

It's a pointless gesture as plenty of other countries (Switzerland, Malta etc) are jostling for position to be 'the crypto nation' and will happily host exchanges, crypto credit cards, hardware wallet storage vaults and all manner of other services where people from countries without privacy coin exchanges can easily and legally trade and use privacy coins.

Once they realize attempting and failing to block it makes them look foolish, they'll endorse it and pretend they were in favor of it the whole time.",1525361912
"Buffet has an active mind and personality. I'd say that his partner Charlie Munger is old. He has dismissed Bitcoin as ""disgusting"", which shows he understands absolutely nothing about it at all, and doesn't know that understands absolutely nothing about it. ",1525361898

"I agree that we should stop saying that BCH is the real Bitcoin. I think the name Bitcoin Cash is strong enough to stand on its own, especially as the better utility becomes apparent to more and more people in the future. But I understand why Roger is saying it. He has put seven years of his life into promoting Bitcoin full time. And since he was one of the first people to really 'get it', and to promote and invest in Bitcoin in a big way, he probably thinks of Bitcoin as his baby. So he is obviously very attached to the name. And since BCH works in the same way as Bitcoin did before 2016, and BTC does not, I understand why he maintains that BCH is the real Bitcoin. 

There's no denying that the main purpose and attractiveness of Bitcoin has aways been that we could send money peer-to-peer basically for free. When fees and confirmation times went up, Bitcoin stopped being Bitcoin.",1525361862

Good luck with your shitcoin",1525361850
"We don't know all the details yet, but if we take clues from the video, we can see that they are putting emphasis on fiat to fiat transactions. Meaning that with smart contracts and oracles anybody could send fiat to anybody through, the tangle, instantly and feeless. 

But if they can do that with fiat, they can do that with any digital currency twice as easily. Meaning you could be able to send Bitcoin fast and free through the tangle.

Also, distributed distributed computing is a whole other topic that has just as many possibilities. ",1525361823

Bitcoin remains the only Blockchain project to have completely anonymous and unknown founders. Thus it cannot be matched. MoE and SoV is a winner-take-all and Bitxoin has really the only fundamentals that matter. ,1525361781
"The best way to do this is two new columns:

* one for fully diluted (i.e. current price * number of tokens that *will ever* be in existence / 21 million)
* current bitcoin equivalence (current price * number of tokens in circulation / number of bitcoins in circulation)

Both of those tell you different things, since coins don't have the same issuance/inflation profiles as bitcoin.",1525361740
"So people should get their way if they outnumber the thinkers regardless of merit? That's your Justice warrior logic? Decentralization is not democracy. 

Many of these ""outliers"" are trying to work together for a goal greater than day trading. 

If you just want to feel like you have a relevant voice or just want attention maybe you should leave crypto and go back to tumblr or something.",1525361725
"Friends w crypto journalists. They talk amongst themselves about the theory that the NSA released bitcoin after the 2008 collapse to absorb capital that might be leaving the usd as the worlds global reserve currency in favor of the yen. 

Theory goes that btc is a long term hedge. If usd isn’t the worlds currency better it be bitcoin then another gov gain that status.",1525361719
"&gt; If you think that Bitcoin needs a blocksize higher than 1MB then eventually you are going to have to switch

Times will tell.

&gt; to BCH
No.

&gt; or fork Bitcoin yourself.

If Progress on Bitcoin halts I might consider supporting a split, but a responsible one.

&gt; Core is never going to go higher than 1 MB
This in itself is a skewed rhetoric, because blocks in Bitcoin are already higher than 1MB. They are 4MWU, which in practice can translate to around 2.5MB.

&gt;nobody would take them serious after that.
This again demonstrates deep confusion about what the contention is about. The battle that Bitcoin developers and supporters have been fighting was not ""keep blocks 1MB forever"". The actual points are things such as:

1. Changes require consensus.
2. Development &amp; Testing should be done rigorously and carefully.
3. Soft forks are preferred to hard forks. And HFs should have a long lead time.
4. People should be able to run nodes.

Because of #4, the general sentiment has been that the blocks shouldn't be increased while there is still plenty of space; and that first, the possibility of an increase with a soft fork should be taken advantage of (#3). Therefore, there was no consensus for a HF increase (#1), and there was an opposition to trying to fork away irresponsibly by projects like XT and Classic (#2).

None of this contradicts in any way the notion that when a HF block size increase is unavoidable, and palatable due to hardware advances, it will be implemented.

&gt;Good luck with LN, do you already like the user experience?

Too early to comment on that. In its beta, preliminary stage it doesn't always work as expected. But when it does, payments are dirt cheap and are 100% confirmed faster than you can say ""Lightning Network"".",1525361706
"Well it’s very easy to see that is an outright lie. For anyone reading this go to any historic daily and see for yourself what is the main topic of conversation.

Also for a coin that lost relevance it appears to be doing pretty good compared to market cap / share compared to BCH and every other crypto on existence ",1525361682
Taking over bitcoin.com and the @bitcoin twitter handle lol? They weren't taken over...,1525361661
"You know exactly what Core is... people that sabotaged BTC, and send useful idiots like your self, to write garbage in here... same people that hijacked r/bitcoin, told us Bitcoin supporters to fuck off some place else, and why that some place else became r/btc.

So stop pretending and just piss off.",1525361594
"You're a daily visitor and you still don't get it? I find that hard to believe.

If you want news on BTC\-Segwit you should go to r/bitcoin where you will get plenty of censored news about your favorite Ponzi scheme, and also other Blockstream approved ventures.

Here we mostly talk about Bitcoin \(BCH\). BTC lost relevance when it forked away.",1525361566
"Okay, right. I understand.

The whole point was, IOTAs tangle was better in every way, except the argument of centralisation and smart contracts. Its feeless, scalable, etc.

On Blockchain, you can build smart contracts. That is a huge use case. Would you agree that smart contracts where a huge innovation and are a great aspect of blockchain technology? I sure would.

So the news that the 3.0 crypto tech (tangle) is building everything that 2.0 crypto (smart contracts) can do, is the news that could make blockchain (1.0 and 2.0) obselete.

Every argument against IOTA is slowly fading away.

Whats the point of blockchain when you have a feeless scalable version of it? The only argument left is centralisation. A) They have layed out a clear plan for that. B) Business won't care if it solves the problems and enables the next generation of tech innovation.

Q Also adds other things, all I've covered here is smart contracts. The fact is, IOTA has forever seemed to good to be true. The longer we go on, they more they show its reality.

"&gt; I know the assumption is that the perpetrator of that is someone in the bcash camp, but is there any proof?

Other than the fact that they are the ones most able to do it and the timeline of when the spam was happening more/less was coinciding with BCH events/announcements (particularly from Ver), it's circumstantial, sure, but ask yourself who would be most motivated to carry out such an attack? They've made it their modus operandi to sell BCH by trashing BTC, instead of on its own virtues, and they control a lot of BTC and hash power.

&gt; Also if you want to disconnect from government fiat you're going to have to get used to insider trading being ok. Ain't nothing besides a government gonna stop that. Ver may be an asshole but he's right about that.

If you take an extreme libertarian view, perhaps. But within the current exchange space, where most of it is regulated, moves like the pre-GDAX BCH trading were clearly wrong in most people's eyes, and preventable. Bitcoin may have emerged on a wave of libertarian ideals, but with crypto now more popular than ever, that's no longer the case.",1525361211
"That was my reaction as well. We've seen a lot of childish behavior in crypto. It's been eye-opening watching it. In the end, this is just one little web site. Who are they ""helping"" with this editorializing? Not sure. But, they did get to have their mini tantrum.",1525361168

Lol that's how crypto works,1525361067
"Perspective is really a funny thing. Let's look at the coins you rated ""safe investments"". 

1) Vechain is a shitcoin shilled on Reddit every single day. They to this day have no usecase, only future potential usecase. It's currently not used for anything really, if so, then please don't insult me, but link me to where *you or someone else* actually uses Vechain for something. To my knowledge it's a shitty ERC20, just like many others, with the difference being, that's actively heavily marketed to Reddit idiots - supply chain this - future that - the truth is, it's ERC20 good for nothing, other than holding right now. Whether or not their outragous claims are true in the future remains to be seenn. 

&gt; due to it’s 3rd generation blockchain

2) It's not having a blockchain, so what exaclty are you talking about? Further stress tests have revealed problems. I'm sure they're working on that, but last time I checked their claimed TX/s is not as high as it really is. Furthermore it was distributed by doing captchas. I like Nano too, but is it a ""safe"" investment? No it's not. 


Disclaimer: I do own IOTA myself. 

3) IOTA currently is dependant on a coordinator doing snapshots of the network, because it doesn't work at the moment and is very much reliant on that centralized entity. I know the argument is that the network hasn't reached critical mass and thus it's required. 

But for as long as that's the case, essentially it's a centralized nodesoftware platform. Their CEO is a huge asshole. IOTA continue to receive the biggest shit from other crypto experts in the field and the non-existing wallet doesn't help them either. They have a long road ahead, and whether VW thinks they're cool, or whether Lady Gaga soon buys IOTA is irrelevant. Problems are still massive. 


I like BNB though. 



That's your ""safe"" coins. 



Honorable mention: Medium safe - Steemit. 


Had money invested once, exited with a profit. Exited for a good reason. If someone is curious, you're free to ask and I will provide you information, as to why I exited Steemit. Tldr it's not as good as Reddit and it's not as good as the first sight might seem. 


REQ and PRL are shilled on Reddit everyday. Some translate shilling to something good. I personally don't like it. It screams marketing campaign to me, so I'm careful/observing immediately. 


RemindMe! 12 months - I think there's a good chance actually, that instead of 100xing your money, you may have simply lost everything in the process, but being way, waaay too risky in Crypto and blindly believing the shit you're told. But we'll find out in 12 months - or I will. 


Either way, the thing people quickly forget or simply refuse to accept, is that green numbers for a short while don't mean that the coins are good. Anything can pump.

GS BTC desk starting trading immiently as approved by board of directors (including CEO) Has already been clearing CME/CBOE futures for months. Will issue their own futures. Will trade directly once they have regulatory ok and institutional storage solution.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/technology/bitcoin-goldman-sachs.html



Interestingly, coinbase spun off a new company late last year.(https://medium.com/@barmstrong/announcing-coinbase-custody-a-digital-currency-custodian-for-institutions-907166d7af85) dedicated to custody and institutional storage solutions. We could see a major headline their in the coming months. I'm sure CB is foaming at the mouth to get that contract. 


Goldman, has done a fine job down playing Bitcoin, still characterizing it as not a currency but just an asset that its investors want exposure to. Meanwhile, they have acknowledged at the highest levels of their firm that it is important enough to dedicate a desk to it. Surely, all of wallstreet takes notes when moves like this happen. I would be surprised/shocked if there isn't a flurry of activity at every other firm that isn't being reported.

Thank you for the detailed answer ... Seems like this is a serious industry changing potential token.  Not bad if I buy and forget as well as DCA buy. 

I never wanted to hodl crypto more than a few months to an year for great gains.  But seems like IOTA can be treated as a company stock seeing it's industry potential. Never thought that way about IOTA.

"&gt; what if you bought the ETH and didn't exchange it to XRP right away. what if you waited 2 weeks and prices flucutated in that meantime.

If you bought ETH at $700, when you exchange it for XRP, your capital gains (or losses) will be whatever ETH is at the time you exchange.  You're essentially selling your ETH and then buying XRP with dollars.  The fluctuation has no affect.

&gt; I believe trade history isn't recorded in fiat price

There are tools/sites that do that and generate this for you.  I use:  

https://cointracking.info/tax/

But it doesn't support a lot of small exchanges as well as decentralized exchanges and things like Shapeshift where you have no account.  

This makes it very hard to near impossible track everything if you do thousands of trades every year across these small exchanges.  It also makes it near impossible for IRS to track all the trades you do outside major exchanges with no KYC and/or no records.  People will come here in January shilling tax filing services and scare noobs about chainanalysis but it's not going to happen for thousands of people trading dozens of cryptos across exchanges without KYC, etc.

Something you could look into as you get more sophisticated is crytpo to fiat lending like Salt or the newly available Nexo.  Basically desposit crypto as collateral, get a loan in fiat and it's not a taxable event.  You pay interest but hopefully crypto appreciates at a higer rate than the shitty interest rate they charge you.  But in any case you avoid capital gains so that's a big win.",1525360575

"What time frame are we talking?

If IOTA becomes the standard (think http or tcp/ip, etc.) for Industry 4.0 (machine 2 machine etc.) and Internet of Things, then the market is MASSIVE. We are talking trillions within the next years.

And from any technology out there, IOTA so far is the furthest along to achieve this (and this is exactly what their goal is: to become the industry standard) - not just technology wise but also as far as having their foot in the door (by partnering with big corporations like Bosch, Fujitsu, VW, DXC, etc...). And if you've thought and read about how machines/robots will be able to do 50%+ of human jobs, then you understand how much more potential there will be in the coming years (and it already is massive enough as it is, even without predictions like these).

They are also a non-profit in Germany which pretty much means no company has a problem using their technology as the industry standard, as they are stepping on nobodies toes (so to speak).

So, 20 Billion? No problem. Ethereum is already at over 70 Billion, Bitcoin over 150 Billion (and this at the current ""lowish"" market, not even ATH). And we all know/believe crypto in general will become a much bigger market, and inside that market IOTA is able to achieve much, much more than other coins, especially if it becomes the standard. So 100's of Billions MarketCap is definitely doable for IOTA in the next few years, with even Trillion in reach in 5-10 years.

"From strictly legal position, you get taxed on every conversion, profit or loss. ETH to XRP, XRP to ETH, ETH to USD. So you buy $1000 ETH, then by the time you buy XRP your ETH is worth $1001, you get taxed on that $1. Then you sell XRP at $1200 to ETH, you get taxed on the $199. If your $1200 of ETH gets to $1300 by the time you go to convert to USD, you get taxed on the $100. 

This can become the most problematic if you trade with huge gains (which count as a profit), then your investment tanks but you don't want to lock in that loss. So Say I bought $1000 XRP when it was $0.10, it rises to $3.00 and I sell to BTC making $29,000 taxable. BTC then tanks leaving my investment down to $5000, but I don't want to sell that yet.

This does not even require a ""state"" to exist.

In a purely voluntary society, any third party who took advantage of this breach of rights would also likely be ostracized for being a jerk.

&gt;Ownership rights do not come from ""jurisdictions"" or governments
&gt;&gt;Ofc, it does. If there's a dispute over ownership, there has to be an authority to solve it. From kindergarden to Supreme court. Jurisdictions are emergent properties of complex societies, even human children have them

Now you are contradicting yourself.

If you really believe this to be true, then it's totally fine if the government agrees with me that I have a property right in my creative works, and then throws anyone in jail who they catch downloading my IP from the blockchain.

That is not the world I'd prefer to see exist, but it is the world you just justified.

&gt;Property rights are natural human rights
&gt;&gt;Unfortunately, there's nothing natural about it. There're a lot of collectivistic cultures. Property rights is a way to prosperity and peace. I'm glad that I live in time in which some cultures are figured that out already

Rights are rights, even if no one respects them. They are ""natural"" rights in that they are laws of nature, quite a bit like gravity.

Collectivist cultures do worse because they don't recognize natural rights. That is part of how we know that they are indeed natural rights.

For instance: If a culture doesn't believe in gravity and everyone in it jumps off a cliff, that culture will have a bad outcome, regardless of whether they respect the natural law of gravity.

The same holds for natural rights: Cultures that mistakenly believe that lying and stealing and murdering your way to the top are all virtues will have worse outcomes. 

That these things are not as conducive to human flourishing over the long term as are peaceful cooperation, markets and free association is literally a law of nature. Natural law, natural rights.

I remember telling my friend once, that blockchain changes everything, even the Internet will be free again with the help of shitcoin Substratum. Thinking back, I can't help but think how ignorant I was. How I blindly just believed the shit I was told by Datadash, or Substratum themselves. Eventually the red flags became impossible to overlook and I sold at a profit recently. That's good enough. 




Spreading adoption is fine and all, but spread adoption where you absolutely know for sure that it's not a scam and there's very, very few players where you can with confidence say it's not a scam or a hypetrain alone. There's Bitcoin, there's Litecoin and Monero and Ethereum.

Before you go take a look at this comparison of them"" - That way it's impossible for them to claim we're trying to mislead people and we still get our message out. We accomplish the same thing and seem more honest. 

---

That aside, there's more than just that lending to the idea that ""BCH Shills"" are misleading people and a lot of people in this thread are delusional to think otherwise. I've seen several comments like ""We aren't trying to confuse them""... Well somebody fucking is. If you haven't seen the comments saying stuff like ""Well BCH is the real bitcoin"" I don't even believe you can read. It happens all the time, and I have a couple thoughts on it. 

First, If you are the ones saying BCH is the real bitcoin, what's wrong with ""Well BCH is the one that follows the original paper"" or something. That way you don't seem shady and still have a good reason for the naming convention. 

Second, I think some of the people that say shit like that are actually core supporters. They say something stupid that is easily disproved or obviously sounds like a scam to make BCH look bad. It's a form of [astroturfing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing). They pretend to be BCH supporters and shout a bunch of dumb shit to make BCH supporters seem dumber, and to be loud enough to cover up actual benefits to BCH that are being talked about. 


---

I have two problems with the argument of BCH being the ""real bitcoin"".

1. I don't think we are the real one and this is one thing I personally strongly disagree with memorydealer on. We are not bitcoin. There was a vote, segwit won. Satoshi's paper itself says ""They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of...{stuff about valid blocks}...Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism"". So by satoshi's original definition, core is the real bitcoin, we are the fork. I think there's a strong parallel here with the president. Some people said ""not my president""... bitch, he's in the fucking white house so yes he is. You don't have to like him but he is literally the president. 

2. why does it matter? The ""real bitcoin"" doesn't make us more valuable or more useful as a currency. It changes nothing so there's no point wasting breath debating it. We need to be talking about the merits of big blocks over segwit and lightning, and we need to have honest conversations about it. We also need to be improving (which we are). Big blocks isn't enough. If big blocks is the only thing differentiating us, they'll steal it if it works and keep doing what they're doing if it doesn't work.

As a follow up to thinking that it isn't important: 

""Never argue with an idiot, they'll drag you down to their level and beat you with experience."" - George Carlin.

That stands perfectly for what we are doing. We're so busy shouting back and forth that nobody has bothered to fix ourselves before casting the proverbial first stone. When you see somebody say something that is wrong but in support of BCH, take the time to correct them. It's worth it. What will core say when we really can't be accused of being misleading. Their main argument is ""big blocks are too expensive"" and ""BCash shills are liars"" so let's stop feeding the lie. It doesn't matter if we agree on who the real one is because the outcome doesn't make a difference to the technology's usefulness. If we get rid of their ability to say that we are liars, then all they have left is the block size argument. For that we can let the tech speak for itself. ",1525359407

"Yeah that’s no problem. I suggest you do a bit of reading about the history of bitcoin. In an hour or two you can quickly get the whole history.
Have you ever used Btc? I remember in November and December the fees were sky high and it was taking some people weeks for a transfer (being serious here)

Yet on Bch your tx is always in the next block. Always the same low fee

The old Btc used to work like that (it had the 1mb blocks back the pn also, but much less users)

Then the oldest devs got squeezed out by a group of devs (whose two figure heads never believed in btc (openly said so) until it was accepted for a few years)
These new devs took away features that were in the original Btc (ever wondered how the newspaper was put on the blockchain by Satoshi but cant do it now?)
They then added features for what they call security.

Bch basically is in the process of removing these features that were only added in the past few years, putting back in the older features that were taken out.
 - In a few weeks it will have basic ability for smart contracts, an old feature removed few years ago for extra ‘security’
 - Extra space so data can be put on the chain (remember I said Satoshi putting the front page of the newspaper on chain?). Social media sites like memo.cash and blockpress.com operate on chain, this ability is removed from Btc. Check them out.
- When the time comes that the general public wants to try crypto (like December) bch wont crash, fail or stall. People will be able to use it as it is and still with low fees. In two weeks it will have half the capacity of Paypal. That is serious. It is akin to Btc years ago with the 1mb block size and people were sending eachother money to try it out.
-Bch does make compromises. Like Satoshi said. But the crypto sphere don’t understand that life is full of compromises. Satoshi knew this when he said there would be giant server farms (centralisation by btc standards, which actually means its currently centralised by their own standards). The btc crowd are akin to a laptop salesman telling you never to connect your brand spanking new laptop to the internet in case it gets a virus. It’s completely counter intuitive
-I don’t believe the BTC devs are bad people. I think they are just in an echo chamber and don’t try to use crypto on a daily basis. (Samson Mow didn’t even have a wallet on his phone according to Roger Ver). But they have done a lot of damage to the brand Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash wants to restore this (remember December, if people could actually have used it you think Btc would be only $9k now?)

In the end none of this will matter to the common person. But it is important for us. As we are the early adopters. In any situation in life get all the info and make your own mind. Question everything Btc people say, question everything Bch people say.
But please just use the damn thing instead of keeping it locked away",1525359199

1) It's their money, thus it's their decision. 

2) How can you possibly educate? Most are not coders themselves. You can explain the baseline, but when it comes to un-safe shitcoins, I would never ever think about advertising these. After having invested in three recent coins I thought were great, I did some research and found that there's potential for scam/pump and dump. 


That said, how can I possibly preach shitcoins, knowing that in the future I might find out that they're not great at all, but a pump and dump? I might exit in time, my friends might now.

If they want to know stuff, or want my opinion, I will give it to them. I'm no longer preaching anything.

It's just not healthy to advertise it actively. You mostly get shat on, and I like to spend my time better, than make friends and family shit on me constantly. 


Answer questions in a calm manner and revert every ""bubble"" suggestion back to reality and make them understand that you simply disagree and time will tell who is right.

"&gt;They did change. They just did it politely. 

Not sure what did they *change politely*... but mostly, if you think that people are involved in *polite* power struggles, then I'm not sure we this conversation has much of a point.

&gt;They could've forced core to hard fork the pow if they had simply forked without replay protection etc.

If they could have forced Core to do anything, they would have. One of BitPay's engineers was fired after he went on record disclosing that one of the intents of S2X/NYA was to ""fire Core"". So no, nothing was done politely, it was open hostility towards Core. (It arguably still is.) And yet, Core is still there... whatever ""Core"" is.

&gt;Instead they went S2x and hedged with BCH'ers assuming core would defect. 

This is disingenious. People started to include BCH **after** they realised there was a market for it. No business ""hedged"" with BCH - They simply saw BCH established a market, which required minimal changes for the businesses (!!!) and so decided to activate it. Let's also not forget that some of the biggest businesses supporting BCH, like BitPay, have Roger on the board. Similarly, businesses still unwilling to activate SegWit have Roger on the board (e.g. blockchain.info). Rather than ""hedge"" this looks a lot more like a clear push in one direction over another one.

&gt; If BCH buys it all, the chain commonly described as BTC will die.

This is true... but it's also such a remote possibility that it's not even worth discussing. In the event of price parity, hash power will simply split 50%-50%. Actually... and here's the irony, even with price parity Bitcoin will have *more* hash power than BCH. Why? Fees... higher fees will make the Bitcoin block reward MUCH more interesting. And don't forget that the block reward for BCH will diminish before Bitcoin - The halvening will happen on BCH before Bitcoin. You should expect a rebalancing of hash power then.

&gt;How can you deny the role of p2p sharing in the rise if crypto?

Let's say that crypto was being used for contract killings or child prostitution. (I'm not saying that it is, though, who knows? Just go with the hypothetical here for a sec.)

Just because crypto is good, does it make those things good? Obviously, we have to examine each separately. The same is the case here.

I am not aware of any connection between crypto and pirate communities, but if you say there is in some places, I'll believe you. There are connections between crypto and all sorts of communities. It doesn't make them the same, and does not make either better or worse.

&gt;I believe true p2p systems like Linux and torrentz cemented the potential workability of truly decentralized systems.

I never said they weren't. Knives are workable implements for use when mugging someone. It does not follow that mugging people is good, or that knives should be banned. But mugging should certainly not be considered ok.

&gt;I acutely disagree that an art or invention or anything anyone cones up with is their intellectual property. There's a reason anarchists have a categorical problem with private property. 

Whoah. You're not talking about ""anarchists"" now, you're specifically talking about ""anarcho-*communists*"", or perhaps more accurately, just ""communists"".

Anarchocapitalists, voluntaryists, agorists and many other more rational and reasoned types of anarchists certainly believe that private property claims are valid, and most of them would argue that you cannot make clear, meaningful and logically consistent distinctions between ""personal"" and ""private"" property.

&gt;BTW I'm an artist and writer for a living. I understand what you're saying more than I'm agreeing with.

Bitcoin was created as a means to provide personal financial Sovereign t, to protect against wealth extraction. Poor corrupt nations are the main beneficiary of such technology.

"Warren is wrong. Warren is judging others as he stands on his moral soap box. Gambling is driven by compulsion, entertainment, emotions; it is usually short-term bursts of discrete events like games of chance; gambling does not usually contribute to a project or organization/community building something bigger; a gambling person holds no tangible asset. On the other hand, I would argue that this following definition of investing fits the crypto-assets investing landscape. Of course, there are ineffective investors who break these rules and fall flat on their faces--gamblers or just incompetent fools? The true investor does research, has a long-term plan, is systematic, and holds an asset for a profit. For me investing is marked by self-discipline and patience. Gambling is usually sloppy and immediate. Research-based: Investing is defined as, ""Any activity in which money is put at risk for the purpose of making a profit, and which is characterized by some or most of the following (in approximately descending order of importance): sufficient research has been conducted; the odds are favorable; the behavior is risk-averse; a systematic approach is being taken; emotions such as greed and fear play no role; the activity is ongoing and done as part of a long-term plan; the activity is not motivated solely by entertainment or compulsion; ownership of something tangible is involved; a net positive economic effect results.""

You seem to have missed my previous point. Its not about trademark, its the deliberate attempts to confuse and defraud people. You will notice there is no suit for the other coins using similar names: because they havent attempted to defraud people.

Try to understand that.

&gt; just because USD are the most popular dollars in the world doesn't mean you can just assume anytime someone says dollars they mean USD and sue them for fraud.
&gt; If the contract didn't say $, and instead just said ""dollars"", and it was an international contract

I believe a reasonable arbitrator would disagree with you. 

The people who have been defrauded had a reasonable expectation they were getting bitcoin and not something else. It is the common currency, listed everywhere and accepted everywhere, while the obscure altcoin is an attempt to cheat and confuse people into a coin which is accepted nearly noone and extremely obscure. 

If you try to play a cutesy game of bait and switch, the arbitrator will hit you with additional punitive damages. So for btrashers sake, they will hopefully come up with a better defense, or settle out of court before they get a big judgement.

"Majority/Minority is not determining factor as to what defines Bitcoin. What defines Bitcoin is its working principles, and in case you end up with 2 blockchains that both follow these working principles, then and only then, you use the majority/minority measure to determine what is Bitcoin.

BTC fork no longer satisfies the Bitcoin working principles, SegWit broke those rules, and 1MB limitation is just another attack vector to prevent its usage, so using the exact same rules that determines what is Bitcoin, we only have 1 valid Bitcoin chain, and that is Bitcoin Cash.

BTC is the fake Bitcoin... Core that control it, that prevented its usability, openly advocate for not using Bitcoin system.

Person has to be an idiot not to understand this... but clearly many people are idiots as many still don't get these basics of what determines Bitcoin, or even have the ability to think for themselves. As soon as you say you trust in best developers (which is what BTC folk say) you show you don't know what you are doing, it shows you put trust into something that should have no trust, which means you fail in understanding one of the most basics of Bitcoin.",1525355159

I agree with your comment 100%. I love the old school wiki-esque feel of the current Bitcoin.org. Bitcoin was never created with the purpose of how much it would eventually be worth in US dollars.

You would need to disrupt the equilibrium by messing with the incentives of miners and node runners to convince them to start inflating the currency.

The radical transparency bitcoin brings to public purses via a global, immutable, public ledger that no-one can cheat is the *real* breakthrough here.  It's this crowd-lead scrutiny backed up by a decentralised governance system that cannot be subverted by the powerful, that leads to a truly egalitarian sharing of wealth.  The digits themselves in that ledger are virtually meaningless, it's what we collectively decide to do with them that matters.  In the meantime we have to accept that the initial distribution is going to be chaotic and uneven until the ecosystem figures out how to get us to that Type I Civilisation.  Much like all those interconnected hard drives on the early internet was a truly chaotic information sharing frenzy...

Bitcoin *the* stepping stone toward a world computer running a resource based economy that *truly economises* and where money as we understand it today is no longer needed (due to us all coming to the realisation we live in a world of abundance).

"&gt; Because Bitcoin is worth more, the altcoin is worth the same, therefore that altcoin can be bought with less bitcoin. It's exactly the same as if the value of the dollar goes up, then the price of euros in dollars goes down.

I think you're fundamentally misunderstanding how the value of coins in the crypto market are calculated....

Here is an example scenario, for this scenario let's assume that Bitcoin is worth exactly $10,000 per 1 BTC to start with.

X coin is currently worth 0.1 BTC, that's what it's being traded for, making the coin worth $1000. Remember, X coin **does not** (like most cryptocurrencies) have an actual value in dollar because it's traded **against Bitcoin**. Now while X stays stable at 0.1 BTC, the price of Bitcoin in **dollars** goes to $20,000. Now the price of X coin is still 0.1 BTC but the value in dollars is $2000, but no trading has happened on X coin at all in this period, only Bitcoin has gone up in value in dollars.

You can't buy more of X coin with your 1 BTC now that 1 BTC is worth $20,000 because the price of X coin is still 0.1 BTC. You can still **only** buy the exact same amount of X coin which is 10 X coins.

Business oriented sidechains, however, is a valid premium product. If large corporate actors can have paid side-chain products to take load off the main chain, it will make the BTC blockchain leaner, smaller - and yes, more decentralized!

"Subscribe to r/tippr, then

If you want to withdraw pm it the message ‘withdraw’, you will need a Bch address on a wallet to do this obviously
If you want to deposit pm it the message ‘deposit’ and it will give you a unique address to deposit to
If you want to check your balance pm it the message ‘balance’ and it will let you know
If you want to tip, reply to some one with ‘$x u/tippr’

It’s a short and easy way to show how Bch can be used. It more importantly proves how cheap it is (I think a transaction is about 1/3 of a cent and will be lower in future). Nlw you can send a euro or a million euros for that price. Its incredible. No one can stop you or block you

This is what Bitcoin is all about. 

Btc has high fees, which they say secures the network. No doubt Bch makes compromises, but you are about 99% secure.

One important thing to note. Everybody here used to have a huge hard on for Btc. Nobody is happy things turned out the way they did. 

Bch wants every person in the world to be able to use it. If you are a lumberjack in remote Siberia and earn €100 a month you will not be able to pay fees. 

The big misconception about crypto is what we want.
Most followers of Bch want that Siberian farmer to have economic freedom, and force his government (and ours) to open up free trade. He then earns more more and can have a better life. So it’s not necessarily about us getting rich, it’s more helping poorer people gain more financial freedom.

Alot of people in crypto now are here for the money. You will see it on r/bitcoin and r/cryptocurrency they post pics of lambos and stupid memes. 
I can solidly say the vast majority of this community would be over the moon if the money they put into crypto (eg €1,000) is worth exactly €1,000 in 10years (or crypto equivalent!) but instead if there is economic freedom for the 2nd and 3rd world (we also need it but they need it more than us)

To be fair there are some good people in Btc, but their whole idea is to move to a second layer (because on chain fees are too high and they won’t compromise on ‘security’). This layer will not be peer to peer and will involve banks (or as near as you can get) thus keeping all of us in the same system. They say it will not be like banks but the history of Btc has told us they do not have sound economic principles (I am sure someone can post you links on the whole story, it is really interesting. Some far fetched like the Bilderberg accusations tho). So get all your info, lurk around the scene and wait your time until you think it is a good price to buy whichever crypto you feel is suited for you. 

Just a word of warning, don’t go looking to be a millionaire, you wont invest €10and be rich in 2 years, that boat has sailed.

This is our chance to make a difference, and I am confident that the more altruistic community which has a real energy, vibrance and willingness to go about it will come out in top. But it will be tough, and the odds are not in our favour. You won’t be seeing this community abandoning, we are here more on core values for a better society than anything else.

Beta had those until VHS offered more capacity.  A one-hour limit meant a movie had to be interrupted to change tapes.

MySpace had it until Facebook showed up.

BTC is making improvements to scale within the confines of the 1Mb 'base block' because reasons.  This is some good stuff, but they are demanding that everyone sit back and wait while they build it.  Lightning Network was '6 months away' in 2015 and it is just now starting to see the light of day, and is only meeting the minimal goals.  It might work well one day, but it is a long way from being able to work at scale.

We begged/pleaded with BTC developers to lift the 1Mb limit to let the ecosystem expand, but they still refuse to do so until they can optimize every bit crammed into a block.  Potentially good stuff, but they killed off momentum and growth at the same time.  

That scaling work could have continued with larger blocks and users could have continued with cheap fees, but the BTC developers made the decision for the community.  BTC made conscious decisions to not support Ethereum contracts (it was designed to run on BTC, until the BTC team decided they didn't want the 'spam' and made changes specifically to block ETH).

When the BTC chain gets busy, the fees go up, the users complain, the merchants complain, and they just tell everyone to STFU and to quit using the network.  What healthy business does that?

Do you think McDonalds can stay in business if they said ""Sorry, we've already served 100 customers today.  Try again tomorrow. k-thx-bye!""


Bitcoin Cash takes the approach that it is providing a platform.  What people can do with it is up to their imagination.  We're not telling people they can't build something.  We're not telling people to quit using our platform.  *They don't have to ask for permission to use our platform.*

It seems the goal of BTC is to move all activity to LN.  That's not using the proven and solid Bitcoin protocol to do everything it can do.  BTC is actively strangling itself.

BTC is like Henry Ford creating assembly lines to build cars faster, so the cars can be used just to haul horses to where they are needed.

So, BTC and BCH have taken separate paths.  

If Lightning Network eventually works at scale, BCH can make the few adjustments to support it, and LN will run even better and cheaper on top of BCH.

And there will be alternatives besides LN.  Bring it on! Innovate!  Bitcoin Cash is open for business!",1525352071

"**Sell In May and Go Away? Not for Bitcoin Bulls**

https://www.coindesk.com/sell-in-may-and-go-away-not-for-bitcoins-bulls/

Sell in May and go away? While the month may traditionally give equity bulls cold feet, it should probably not be a cause of worry for the bitcoin market.

Indeed, it's true the month of May is often a weak period for equities, and that bitcoin has acted as a risk asset (moving in tandem with equities) since February. As such, cryptocurrency investors may fear that a potential drop in equities could end up dragging bitcoin prices lower.

However, historical data suggests that bitcoin is more likely to build upon its April rally this month.

Notably, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has scored gains in the month of May in five out of the last seven years, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.

View

BTC tends to perform well in May, thus an upside breakout of the narrowing price range is more likely and could yield a quick move higher to $10,000.

On the other hand, a downside break would open the doors to $8,490 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from $6,425 to $9,767.4).

Only a daily close (as per UTC) below $7,823 (April 17 low) would signal a bear revival.",1525350710

"&gt; Wrong again: its to punish fraudsters for misleading people and causing them to lose money for their own gain. The suit includes cases of just that.

It's not illegal to use the name of a technology to sell the technology. It's not even illegal to use the name of a vaguely similar technology to sell different technology. No one ever got arrested for selling fraudulent VHS ""Videotapes"", despite the that the word ""Videotape"" was a trademark of the Ampex corporation that referred to a completely different and incompatible tape technology than VHS.

There is no difference in this case, other than the policing attitude of the supposed owner/s of the term. Ampex didn't start suing people when people started calling other cassette tapes ""Videotapes"", so it went from referring to one specific type of videotape to all videotapes, despite the fact they actually had a trademark that recognized them as having exclusive rights to the word.

This kind of case is based on use, not statute. You are actively trying to criminalize behavior by bringing this kind of suit, whilst claiming to be a passive upholder of universal law, whilst simultaneously claiming to be an advocate of a pluralistic legal system that presumably allows people to be governed by consent not monopoly force.

The people agitating for ""fraud""  are not genuinely aggrieved at the idea someone might confuse BTC for BCH, they're trying to obtain monopoly trademark protection by the back door, because Satoshi didn't get it by the front door. 

&gt;If your employer decided to start paying you in Zimbabwean dollars, because the CEO invested in them heavily, then you would rightly feel defrauded

just because USD are the most popular dollars in the world doesn't mean you can just assume anytime someone says dollars they mean USD and sue them for fraud. What if you're talking to a canadian or an australian? 

If I had no contract I would just stop working for them if they didn't pay me what I asked to be paid.

If the contract didn't say $, and instead just said ""dollars"", and it was an international contract, I would have little to no case since there are so many different types of dollars it could mean anything, which is why its prudent to specify what dollars.

Likewise, due to the open source distribution of Bitcoin, there are many types of Bitcoin. Except rather than just using a unique identifier and allowing the word to enter the commons like ""dollar"" has, people want to bring down monopoly power to cage their competitors of an open source software project that never got a trademark on the name like other projects did.

&gt;You would have people give up all protection from fraud and crime just because the government took a monopoly on justice? Thats very similar to refusing to breathe until the EPA no longer regulates the air.

"**tl;dr:** It does not.

QC is still not with us. There are many efforts to develop a functioning quantum computer (Google perhaps being the most well known) but so far it is still in the labs. Even once we get a decent QC (one with many qubits) we still need to learn how to most efficiently use it.

There are also questions as to whether a QC would be efficient at breaking the cryptography in bitcoin. Quantum computers are good at doing things other than serial computing. An example would be if you are holding a banquet with 1000 people. Some of these people are vegetarians and do not want to sit next to carnivores, some are Hasidic Jews and do not want to sit next to females, et cetera. A quantum computer would be good at finding the optimum seating arrangements, but is not so good at reconciling your budget reports.

Once SHA256 becomes weak with the advances in serial computing, we can simply up the strength, or even change the algo to something inherently stronger.",1525349073

"Nice work, that's very helpfull! I think it would be a good idea to start talking about ""new bitcoins"" (with a, agreed value measured in satoshis). Something easy to figure out. This is how it has been done with some other currencies. Maybe that new bitcoin (nBTC) can be 100 sat. or 10,000 sat. or 100,000 sat, whatever we agree on it will be good. I like the number 10,000 as it's exactly in the middle between one satoshi and one BTC.

10,000 sat = nBTC     and  10,000 nBTC  = BTC

No offence but I'm not sure if you know how blockchains work, there are forks happening all the time. In Bitcoin the longest chain is superseding shorter chains regularly and there are even orphaned blocks. In Nano, delegated nodes are deciding what history is correct/incorrect.

&gt; Also, Nano is not DPOS--it's similar in that voting weight is used but with DPOS, a fixed, elected number of forgers create new blocks and decide which transaction goes in a block. With Nano, millions of representatives could vote on a transaction with their vote weight from the total number of coins.

While that may change as the ""flippening"" may come closer which means the shift of the market's opinion or maybe the market is getting better informed.

The BCH blockchain is a fork of the original bitcoin blockchain. This fork would be what we may call an ""upgrade"".

"Did I say I 'backed' it, or did I say it was making inroads into Asia? The fact is, it's incredibly difficult at this stage to 'back' any project. There's been projects with look completely legit turning out to be scams, and there's projects which is frankly just completely out there i.e. dogecoin, which are relatively stable and have the potential to make money with virtually no functionality. So to say I back any crypto or blockchain project is wrong, it's all purely speculative and that's as much as anyone knows at the moment.

So I speculate that Tron could become a major player in Asia. 

And I speculate that if ADA keeps on its current developmental trajectory with the world class academic team it has, it will be a major player.

You do not yet have that with Crypto.

"So during the bull run of Bitcoin it went from 1K last year to 20K. People who doubt this prediction must have forgot history. It is possible and as I see it - Ethereum was not as hyped as bitcoin the last time, even though the technology is 10 times better. 

Next run Ethereum will fire away.",1525344714
"Just an hour ago, I finally got into BCH. I would just like to share a story of a newb like me:

 I first got into crypto about a year ago and bought BTC as an investment. Throughout the months after reading some, I learned about what it was originally promoting. I appreciated the most about it is the removal of a central authority in what you can and cannot do with your property, in this case, currency. I finally was in it not just for the money but also because I believe in what it stood for. At the height of it all in December was when I started to get into other coins 'cause of the ruckus of that bull run.

Then as I got exposed to other communities, I started wondering, what if BTC was like the friendster or myspace of crypto: it will be left out if doesn't innovate. So I heard about Lightning and all these off-chain solutions. I didn't understand it much but it was good to know they were trying to innovate. That's also around the same time I started getting into this subreddit. I really thought that it was just a bunch of the old BTC people that forked because they wanted more control of the blockchain. And as repeatedly mentioned in the ""other"" community, it was a scam. I believed it. Especially when I saw this confusion about the identity of ""The Real Bitcoin"" thing. It wasn't helping both sides. It appeared that BCH was being ""ran"" by scammers trying to misinform newbies. I was a newbie then.

But as I read more, I learned about the censorship in rbitcoin and the monopoly in development. I don't mind the namecalling 'cause I don't think such thing will ever disappear on the internet. I saw the organic development in BCH here in rbtc where everyone seems to be able to implement just whatever they want. The tipping bots amazed me. I got tipped once and tried transferring it to different wallets and I was amazed how easy it was. I played around with satoshidice with that small tip to experiment and won a few games until I lost everything when I bet it all just for fun. Then I saw this memo.cash - a working product of a decentralized twitter. Suddenly, I realized what the ""revolution"" really meant. I understood then what people say about how BTC was hi-jacked. 

This is now when I decided to move from an old technology to the upgrade of that technology which also has with it the community that drives the spirit of what the ""revolution"" stands for.",1525344690

The Cryptoverse also has good videos, he has a show focused more on altcoins and news updates.  You can find his videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTKyJALgd09WxZBuWVbZzXQ) 

The final suggestion we can give you is Crypto Investor which you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTKyJALgd09WxZBuWVbZzXQ). This channel discusses more general trends in the market and also looks at the updates of several altcoins. 

The reason we recommend these channels is because they are relatively objective. This is quite hard to find in the crypto-community where many newssources are biased. Always cross-check several sources before assuming anything.

With kind regards,

The Anycoin Direct team

"FIAT is so fucked up at this point.  BTC and the like at least have 2 main things at least IMO.  Can't counterfeit and can't print more.  FIAT is constantly printing, constantly being transformed and constantly involving massive debt.",1525343262
"I've made about a 36% gain on it in the last few weeks but past performance is no indication of future gain. Crypto is kinda crazy, once people see something go up they FOMO and drive up the price.

Best case scenario, it goes up to a dollar, people start to FOMO and then it pulls a Ripple and goes up to $3-$4. Realistically, I think it will go up to maybe like 7¢-12¢ this year and maybe up to 20¢ in the next 2-3 years but I know just about the same as anyone else about crypto predictions which is nothing haha.",1525343220

ETH is moving into sharding territory, and we'll see what happens to volume and liquidity when banks flip on the switch with XRP and Ripple's other products.",1525343020

A fungible asset or good is something that is easily interchangable for a currency or assets of the same type. 

The problem here is that ppl think of Bitcoin as the addresses or UTXOs containing them. This is false imo - here's why:

- Send 100 sat from 100 Adresses, 1 sat from each, to Address B
- Send 1 sat to Address C
- From which of the 100 sources did the single sat come from?

Well, you can't tell. The same way you can't track a individual $cent on a bank account, you can only track the accounts and $ movements between them.

"Hello suninabox, let me oppose you again. 
Any fork which doesn't decrease the mining reward will have a higher selling pressure, thus, a lower value. Because current users bought something which they know it's going to inflate a certain way, offering something else is fraud.
But how feasible is this limit? If mining reward decreases, they stop mining as much as before, but this doesn't imply in attacks because their hardware is only compatible with few networks. Either they fork this one, creating a lower value coin, or they endorse another, which if it had a hashpower several times the size of this network, thus being a threat, Bitcoin could be merge-mined with it, though I doubt such would exist. If a powerful attacker wants to destroy Bitcoin, then a POW switch would make him entirely broke. What are the others Bitcoin destruction plans in your head?
If you say that only corporations are able to get their way in Bitcoin, that maybe be truth, but individuals could employ any tools to make their own version survive. While fiat reigns, it's in these corporations incentives to destroy the thing, or least aquire a higher stake in it, but as the their incentives coincide with the survival of Bitcoin, and that's what happens when you get too involved, they will behave just like normal users when you speak about increasing the supply beyond set, which is an excellent idea to throw around for any company trying to make money, isn't it?",1525341164

I also think it's silly to think that tx volume can slowly grow by several tens of thousands of transactions over several months, only for everyone to unanimously **stop** within the period of a few days. 

No, much more likely is that [miners have been creating a base floor of transactions](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/curious-case-bitcoins-moby-dick-spam-and-miners-confirmed-it/) in order to inflate the fees that ordinary users must pay, then mining their own transactions to recover their fees. Once several exchanges finally implemented Segwit and batching, and Lightning started becoming a reality, and new mining hardware began coming online, the spam stopped for a while because it was no longer cost effective. Honestly, ""it's because Core made everybody quit Bitcoin"" might be the stupidest possible explanation. I also think pretending that the period of high fees caused the bubble to pop is very stupid. Since most people convert fee value to USD, the price inflation was largely to blame for the fee increase in USD terms because it acted as a simple multiplier which compounded the miner spam. It's more likely that the price rally stopped prematurely because literally every single exchange was buckling under pressure and several had to stop accepting new registrations until the hype faded.

"Hi Don. Yep, just keep increasing it. I’m not sure at what rate, but there’s a good case for just removing it and letting the miners decide what fees to accept. Normal people shouldn’t run nodes. Want to store a 1gb file on chain? Go for it. The cost today to store 1gb in the cloud is about 8 cents a year. Let’s replicate that 10,000x for decentralisation. That’s $800 in storage costs for 1gb. Let’s say you need to cover 10 years in advance and assume beyond that the cost is negligible due to improved technology, that’s roughly $8000 for 1gb *today*. Now you’re probably better off just using google cloud storage but you could pay 8000 if you really cared. The price here, is being set by the free market (amongst the miners) based on costs to them to store and relay your data. For perspective, a few months ago when btc fees were at a high, miners were making around $20,000 per 1mb block! So you can see they get paid way more than necessary simply due to the “production quota”. From an economic perspective those high transaction fees are 1000’s of times higher than necessary, and there is going to be little financial case for everyone dumping movies on chain over traditional cloud storage....",1525335233

"&gt; Property and information are different things

They are not mutually exclusive. Property is just a human *construct*. Nobody was ever granted authority to say what that construct can be limited to. An example is a girl's virginity. When we say it is *taken* nothing physical is really taken. It's the knowledge and experience which changes. With medical technology able to pretty much induce sex changes, it's no stretch to say any physical aspects can be altered/restored to some similar degree. By your rationale a girl doesn't own her virginity, though, because it's not limited to something we can physically carry or put in a drawer. If it could be transferred by wire then we could pirate that freely too!

&gt;Authorship and ownership are also different things

I agree. A ""work for hire"", as you brought up, means a creator loses their ownership claim.

It's not tools (like guns, bombs, or bitcoin) that are evil. It's people that use tools in ways that's the problem.

It's unethical to use a gun to murder someone in cold blood when not for self-defense. That doesn't mean it's unethical to use a gun for target practice. Same applies to Bitcoin. It's unethical to use Bitcoin to hire an assassin to kill someone with a similar condition as I explained about guns. It's not unethical to use Bitcoin to buy an ice cream cone.

I remember the community and ethos from back in the day. I watched events unfold. I saw the shift in the arguments of key people in Blockstream. I gave benefit of doubt for years. I took the time to read and understand LN. BTC seems to have become something else, for reasons which appear to have been engineered by people that have a vested interest in alternative solutions. That’s no conspiracy, it’s observable reality that considers the nature of human behaviour.

It’s that consideration of incentive that is key to understanding bitcoin and why it works. It’s no coincidence that the people that can’t see why bitcoin works, also fail to understand the behaviour of people in the bitcoin space.

"After seeing and having a few discussions on whether UASF was the reason the Miners activated SegWit.


I thought I would lay out the relevant data in a simple graph for all to see.


For those who don't like pictures....


1. Prior to the NYA SegWit is clearly meandering in the 30% region


2. There is no obvious correlation between SegWit and UASF prior to NYA. 


3. There were no economic nodes signalling UASF. No exchanges or payment providers. 


4. NYA appears on the scene and reaches 90% signalling in days.


5. SegWit signalling follows suit reaching 100% signalling in 7 weeks


6. Meanwhile in this time UASF goes from 11% to 16% adding ~500 nodes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**It may well be a different story if some of those UASF nodes were payment providers or exchanges but CRUCIALLY**


* **They risk loosing a lot of money by doing so, just like the Miners**


* **Unlike the 1300 UASF'rs who risk nothing**

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On 6/11/17 1300 nodes dropped off the network in 2 days [link](https://coin.dance/nodes/all) nobody noticed, I don't see why it would be any different for the UASF crowd, they would fork themselves off and nobody would notice.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UASF nodes spike to [3000](https://imgur.com/a/gSDn1t8) in May and June.


Brought to my attention by SLOWRY (thanks)


I had originally posted with Hernzzzz that UASF nodes maxed out at 180, clearly I had to look at the data again, hence this post.


The data is from [SaltyLemon](https://uasf.saltylemon.org/?peaks=true) the spikes didn't last very long, a day maybe and don't show up on [Coin.Dance](https://coin.dance/nodes/uasf).


I feel this underlines the fact that node count as proof of anything is suspect at best, when someone can fire up 25% of the network and pretend their is support for whatever they feel like.


Gotta love PoW.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hernzzzz 
[argues](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8d8d3m/25_of_the_bitcoin_hash_rate_is_all_it_would/dxpvjxu/)  from the point of view that 


&gt; **Hernzzzz:** Is NYA/SegWit2x active on mainnet? No. Why? It did not have consensus.


1. He sees NYA &amp; SegWit2x as the same thing


2. And if SegWit2x is not active on mainnet today then 


3. NYA/SegWit2x could not of been the reason for activation of SegWit. Qed.


Now


1. NYA was an agreement to activate SegWit then 90 days later hard fork to 2MB


2. SegWit2x was **AN** implementation of the NYA


3. It is equally valid to run an implementation of Core and signal NYA and then activate SegWit on August 24th (prob what most did) **this would still be in keeping with the agreement**


4. **you only need the 2MB part 90 days after 24 August** which we never got to.


So yes it's possible that The New York **Agreement** was the prime mover in the activation of SegWit.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

all data from blockchain.info or coin.dance. [UASF NODE COUNT](https://coin.dance/nodes/uasf), [% OF BLOCKS SIGNALLING NYA](https://blockchain.info/charts/nya-support?timespan=1year), [%  OF BLOCKS SIGNALLING SEGWIT BIP-9](https://blockchain.info/charts/bip-9-segwit?timespan=2years). 


Extracted non duplicate Total node count from [Coin Dance](https://coin.dance/nodes/all) then used this to get a day by day percentage of UASF.


Don't Trust Verify, heh heh

No you don't. You're just routing a payment through them from one of your channels (with only outbound capacity) to another (with only inbound capacity).

I don't understand why you think that. Can you give me a few examples of how people would use the ability to trade channel balances?

They can't, and I never claimed they could.

You are aware that *you* don't have to open a channel in order to have a usable channel, right? There has to be *a* on-chain transaction, but either channel partner can fund the channel. For instance, you buy your first bitcoin on the exchange and want to withdraw via Lightning but don't have any channels. You'd give the exchange your public key and they'd open a channel with you pushing the withdrawal to your side.

Roger has a counterpart in BTC. ""Theymos"" controls bitcoin.org, rbitcoin, and bitcointalk.

Roger has a known face, a public rap sheet, and supports free speech by keeping this sub relatively unmoderated and publishing open modlogs.

Theymos said he didn't care if 90% of bitcoiners left rbitcoin, massively censored and banned thousands of users, and reengineered the sub CSS to curate the message he wants seen.

Who is Theymos? What's on his rap sheet? What's his face look like? Does he flip the bird when the interviewer says ""bcore bcore bcore bcore bcore bcore?"" What did he do with the 6000 Bitcoin he received?

Bitcoin has big problems, granted. But Roger Ver is not top on the list.",1525330984
I already got downvotes from some unicorn-fans. Listen i would like etherium to reach 200.000$... Cause that would mean that crypto has taken over the world and i would be rich beyond imagination... But unless your on drugs or lobotomized you should do the math. I hate those posts just as much as morons on youtube predict tron on 17 Bucks or ripple at 25...,1525330801
