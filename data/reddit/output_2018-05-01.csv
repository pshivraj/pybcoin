No matter how many times I say I'm not on any side I'm getting asked to give arguments for BTC.  I'm asking BCH to tell me why things are they way they are and no one wants to change it.

"Using `SIGHASH_NOINPUT` as a general purpose malleability fix can be tricky. I'm wondering whether it's enough specifically for eltoo.

Suppose I'm using a good implementation of eltoo on Bitcoin prior to SegWit. Can the other party steal my money by exploiting transaction malleability? I think the answer is No. The first transaction (2-of-2 multisig) needs to be confirmed before off-chain payments start, and after that every transaction is floating and thus independent of prior transactions' hashes.

If this analysis is correct, that would be very cool from the theoretical perspective as it would mean that eltoo does await with one of the assumptions made by LN. I'm likely wrong, though, for I'm an amateur.",1525243549
"I don’t disagree that the BTC devs should have been focused on scaling Bitcoin itself regardless of whether or not LN came good. 

But the criticism LN has received on this sub since implementations went into live beta is very rarely “technical”, and very often perpetuates falsehoods about LN being a company, having a CEO, being entirely dependent on some new college grad who talks too fast. Its pretty much a blow-for-blow mirroring of the kind of criticisms Core supporters aim at BCH. Hence my point.",1525243543

"&gt; It is our belief that Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin insofar as it is the closest version of Bitcoin to that described in the original Bitcoin whitepaper.

That's fine. But by calling it ""Bitcoin"", and calling BTC ""Bitcoin Core"", you are intentionally misleading people. You know this, and what's really shameful is that you're here trying to deny it despite it being so obvious. Promote Bitcoin Cash all you want, but don't call it ""Bitcoin"", and don't call Bitcoin ""Bitcoin Core"". You know exactly what you're doing when you use these names. It has nothing to do with the technical merits of BTC or BCH; it is entirely about what you call the coins and the way you describe what they are to new users.

Let's say a die-hard Bitcoin Cash supporter is upset about the upcoming hardfork to 32MB, and thinks that 8MB blocks are the true Bitcoin Cash vision, forks Bitcoin Cash, somehow gains control of the bitcoincash.com domain which is top of the results when people search for Bitcoin Cash, and starts listing their fork as Bitcoin Cash (BSH) alongside the now 32MB block size chain as Bitcoin Cash Core (BCH). The website is very popular and is littered with references to BSH as an upgrade to Bitcoin Cash Core, which they refer to as ""legacy"", and so on. I don't think you'd think that was acceptable, would you? How on earth can you think it's okay to fork a coin and then use that coin's name for your fork?",1525243429

"Great article, you made similar arguments in the past. I think both sound money and value transfer must go hand in hand for Bitcoin to succeed. Either of them alone is not enough.

I've known Zucco for years and his transformation in a Core fanatic has been an embarassing show. I don't doubt his integrity but I find he speaks like a sort of religious fanatic, in his mind Bitcoin Core is the only true coin, Maxwell &amp; Co are the Apostles and Wuille holds the keys to paradise. People that disagree with how the project has been steered are traitors and heretics that must repent or be burned at the stake. He's dogmatic that should Bitcoin (Core) fail, there is no hope at all. It's the only chance for the human race, because absolutely everything else is scam, a failure and will never work. He doesn't make technical arguments, it's dogmatic fanaticism applied to a software.

Personally I hope Bitcoin succeeds but if it doesn't I know something else will. The blockchain cat is out of the bag.

"&gt; I wasn't talking about OP's video. IIRC Roger said Mt Gox's problems were with fiat gateways only. I'll rewatch the video later and correct my comment if I'm wrong. 

So basically you just admitted you don't even remember that video enough now to be confident in your earlier statement with the usual troll libel against Roger Ver for things he didn't even do...

&gt; I said 'perhaps' he was paid. It's clear that he isn't speaking from his mind. 

Still irrelevant personal opinion.

&gt; Yes I know most of bitcoin trading then was through Mt Gox. But even then Andreas and some others were against it IIRC.

Also irrelevant, I didn't see Andreas rushing out to build a new exchange then.

&gt; I didn't say Mark Karpeles shouldn't get any blame. Mt Gox is his fuck up. But that doesn't justify Roger vouching for it. 

Watch the video again, I don't see Roger vouching for anything other than saying Gox was having fiat issues and they were working to correct their banking relationships. He never once said anything to the tune of ""MT.Gix is 100&amp;#37; good on its liquidity and I would bet my right nut will not be insolvant in 5 months"", he was not their accountant, or even an investor/board member. Gox burned 5 months later, that has nothing at all to do with Roger Ver, or he would be in court with Mark right now. ",1525243258

"Not at all. I contend the white paper allows Bitcoin to evolve in any direction, *if it follows Nakamoto Consensus to evolve validly*.

I personally thought that listing BCH as Bitcoin was fine because they were saying that's how they viewed what Bitcoin was.

The problem for BTC is that they staked its entire future on LN to fix all of the scaling problems because Blockstream developers are all terrible idiots with bad ideas who couldn't figure out how to do it themselves.

"&gt; Satoshi had previously said that it's strictly necessary to always treat the longest chain as valid. This code changes that.

I'm not sure this code actually causes the client to follow the preferred chain. It seems to generate an error if the longest chain is not the preferred chain, though I haven't explored it enough to say if that is a fatal error or not. If not, then the code in Reorganize should result in the client treating the longest chain, determined in the function by comparing block height, as the valid chain despite the preference.  

&gt; Where was this code removed in Bitcoin ABC as you claim it now strictly always follows the longest chain?

My claim was that it uses block height as a proxy measurement to identify the longest chain, much as the code in your linked example continues to do in the Reorganize function.

I'm probably missing the point about Nakamoto consensus, but let's be real. Things can evolve. The newest Porsche 911 is still a Porsche 911 even though it looks quite a bit different to the original. If someone created a car today that looked like the original (and maintained the vision), it wouldn't suddenly become the real Porsche 911.

In general I lean strongly towards the politics of BCH (can't stand the censorship in /r/bitcoin since asking even honest questions there is frowned upon, and so they live in an ever growing echo chamber), but I think this is not a great argument for being the ""real bitcoin"". 

If it wasn't for the old adage that all publicity is good publicity I would cry out for this ""who is the real bitcoin"" non sense to stop. I don't see why BCH can't stand on its own two feet with its own identity.

Now, that all said, I think BCH should be free to point out to people how the dream for Bitcoin, at least for many, was X, and now BTC has diverged from that somewhat, and BCH offers the continuation of that original vision. That's perfectly fine.",1525239758

That's how I interpret it as well.

If you create a change that is true to the whitepaper than who is to say that your rules are not valid?

This means that within your group all blocks with the new rule are valid and they build the chain with the highest POW.

"The reason FIAT is useful is that the issuer promises stable inflation. To do so, they have to collect price data all over the country to create a price index and then adjust the amount of fiat they add to circulation or remove. Bitcoin won't really ever be able to achieve low inflation stability, we will always have to relate bitcoin prices relative to a stable currency and price index.

It would be nice if bitcoin could relate itself to a price index to increase price stabilty. In times of inflation (due to bitcoin's value crashing) less bitcoin would be created until it recovers, at which point the algorithm would return to its normal rate.

The problem then becomes to decentralize Price indexes, which I have no idea how it can be done effectively.",1525238227

",1525238171
"This is going to be a long answer. It's going to go against most things this sub believe in.

First: I value the decentralized and uncensorable aspect of Bitcoin much more than the ""fast and cheap"". This means that decentralized and uncensorable may be worth to pay more for, if necessary.

Try having that in mind as you read my answer.

0-conf is a totally fine tradeoff, a bit faster for a bit less security. This is actually the same tradeoff that those taking credit cards today make, but I agree it's safer than credit cards. I have nothing against 0-conf. But it will still end up on-chain.

I believe the most important work we do today for scaling is to *limit* the growth of the blockchain. We're still early in cryptocurrency adoption. I still believe fast and cheap is a goal, but it doesn't *necessarily* have to be fast and cheap to end up on-chain. It would of course be nice if we could do it and still not go on accordance with the core properties of decentralized and uncensorable, but we can't. I will explain: decentralized and uncensorable is not an absolute. It's a scale, from ""totally centrealized and totally censorable"", via ""a bit decentralized and not easily censorable"" to ""decentralized enough"" and ""almost impossible to censor"". I believe it's a goal to end up as close to the best end as possible.

So, that said, Lightning isn't better than on-chain or zero conf per se, but it allows speed and price to be more unrelated to the price of on-chain transactions. I believe we have to accept the fact that on-chain has a cost to remain decentralized, which means we need to create layers on top that are fast and cheap. Lightning has extra security mechanisms, hash-time-lock contracts, that makes it safe to *not* submit transactions to the chain. I will not go in-depth in the safety mechanisms of LN itself here.

Now, about the decentralized aspect:

Larger block increases the cost of running a full node. A full node is a necessary component both for mining and for fully validating the chain. It's separate from mining - but here, I realize my view differ from this sub. This is one of the crucial disagreements between BTC and BCH believers:

A full node fully validates the chain. *Mining* puts a time-stamp on that validation, it's sort of a signature saying ""I validated *this set of transactions* at this time. But for it to be accepted, someone still need to trust your signature. And only full nodes do this fully. You can do it in a limited way with SPV nodes, and it's a tradeoff that's sensible to take for an individual, but the *total* security of the coin *do* indeed depend upon as many people as possible validating this. And what can they do? They can say ""this isn't bitcoin!"" and drop the block! That's a crucial ability, and a key incentive for miners *not* to skip their job, and *not* change the properties of the coin in a whim.

Remember why you're believin in cryptocurrencies as opposed to fiat, again? Yes, it's because we have central entities that in a whim can change the properties of the currency! The more people with the ability to say ""this is not bitcoin!"", the more we differ from fiat in that respect.

So: Making it more demanding to run full nodes will shift the incentives, it will lead to it being more expensive to run full nodes. Now, I happen to think that it'd *probably* be ok to double block size at this time, but it's by *no means* the most important work we do. I put more value in a coin that tries to solve the hard problems of remaining decentralized and uncensorable.

So, I can now try to answer your question:
LN is not ""better than 0-conf and on-chain scaling"", it's a way to have fast and cheap while accepting the necessity to *limit* on-chain scaling.

That said: LN in itself is pretty neat - but still a bit clunky. We're still early days, there's still a lot of quirks to be ironed out, but we *are* getting there.

Increasing the block chain by 9 times to 1.8 TB.

I just one year the btc blockchain would cause it to be too expensive to run a full node. Many full nodes would disappear.

The bigger the block the cheaper it gets to centralize the blockchain. ",1525235413
"What are the lowest possible BCH fee cost for that MB? Because of dust limits the price per byte is higher with very small tx than with larger ones I think (in size, not in amount).

It would take about 4 MB of data to put the entire Bible on to the blockchain and I think I can get that done under a 1000 USD as soon as OP_RETURN has increased. But I don't know if I have done the calculations correct. 

I mean if I would take 0.00001 BCH per kb. And 4 MB is 4096 kb then it would only cost 0.00001 BCH times 4096 which gives: 0.04096 BCH which right now would costs you time 1400 USD = 57 USD to make the bible completely uncenrosable as long as the Bitcoin Cash chain and the internet are around.

"&gt;These are key important features of Bitcoin

[Blockstream devs don't agree because they would like a fee market.](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-December/015455.html) You should know your history, or would your like to rewrite history today in favor of what you want other people to believe? 

You are out of line with the blockstream party Cobra. If you really feel like low fees are important key feautures of Bitcoin then why don't you make change to the code in such a way that there will never be a fee war anymore. The only way of doing that is 

- move all transactions away from the chain and on to the LN
- keep the blocksize always 10 times higher then the average throughput. 

Since blockstream devs pretty much ignore how you feel about Bitcoin and since they still have most power and control over Bitcoin together with theymos. And since miners are never going to agree on running any soft or hard fork after all the false promises and the 90% of miners that wanted a blocksize increase even willing to allow segwit with it ... and they never got it.

Your only option is to either just dissapear and try another persona. Maybe don't use the symbolism of a snake this time.

Or you could just lauch CobraCoin and then see if there are people that think you have good ideas.

If you are a real person, just come forward with your real identity and then we can speak honest and face to face, like real man rather then ssssslithinger snakes. 

You flip flop back and forth and I don't know what your intentions are but probablly just to distract the communities. 

How did you ever convince theymos to give you partial control over bitcoin.org?

Who are you anyways? What country are you from? Don't you know that most people in Bitcoin that actually contribute are not afraid of doing it under their real name? We are still free enough to do so. 

So what are you so afraid of? Or is the person behind Cobra already active in the Bitcoin community but you don't want anybody to know that?

Probablly that last one. Good luck snek. Maybe you will find your eve and get her to bite the apple. ",1525234646

In my opinion, this will happen inevitably. Trying to stir some unnecessary debate at this time is not helpful.

"L2 was always part of the plan for Bitcoin.  Bitcoin was always supposed to have both.  BCH will have both.

"Good points. Let me clarify:

1. The full scope and potential depth of blockchain is something that I think very few grasp - you could be an engineer exploring one application with Rubix Deloitte and still be totally oblivious to the frontier of innovation on another front. So you are correct - my understanding of blockchain (and pretty much everyone who does not actively work on blockchain related projects) is likely to be impaired. Nonetheless...

The potential of blockchain is largely something I see in supply chain management. For example, this will allow full and complete transparency of the composition of every single product, percolating all the way through to every individual raw material component and where it was sourced. The carbon emission from the specific oilfield from which the hydrocarbons that was used to manufacture ethylene were generated, the electric cost of that went into processing industrial steel components, and the specific labour (child labour in Bangladesh) that contributed all the way to the most minute detail... soon you'll be able to look at a finished product and instantly count every single detail down to the location of every sourced raw material and you can instantly track every individual item back to its very source. The implications on corporate responsibility or even financial transparency are staggering.

By comparison, cryptocurrency is a very specific, very niche, and very narrow implementation of blockchain technology. It requires a very specific set of circumstances to evolve, gain traction, and prosper. It's hard for me (and I would argue anyone) to have a strong degree of confidence that all those conditions align.

That's what I meant by my relatively strong confidence in blockchain relative to the specific application in Bitcoin.

2. I agree that generally in various local regions, the appeal of a crypto can be great, especially since it is decentralized and derisked (the local government cannot tamper with money supply for monetary policy). However, this comes down to a macro debate and would require you to do the math on a case-by-case basis. Generally in this situation a flight to capital results in uncontrollable inflation as local currency is desperately sold in exchange for any other store of value. It is going to come down to the numbers and how they add up, because you need to juxtapose local capital flight causing a massive oversupply of local currency to your crypto and compare how much demand there is for a dying currency - would you sell your BTC for a Zimbabwe note? Most people hold crypto as a proxy for something like gold - so how does the supply/demand balance for the tremendous amount of desperate capital flight? I don't have these answers and you would have to run them on a case-by-case basis, but you'll see that the complications add up rapidly.

Not to say that it doesn't work or it isn't viable - the question is, in that situation, how reliable will the local financial structure be? If the Zimbabwe currency is rapidly imploding and the national financial system is falling apart, how reliable can the local crypto infrastructure be? And I don't mean the actual network - I mean literally who are you going to talk to to transact your wildly inflating currency to physically do a transaction? Unregulated, unsupported and not backed by the local central banking bodies, I can't imagine the infrastructure to access cryptos in such a country could be that reliable... the bankers themselves will be busy trying to get on a lifeboat.

So what is the comparative advantage that cryptos would have in this particular case? If you are able to exchange a dying currency for any foreign store of value (e.g. gold) then you are able to do so directly to USD. This seems much safer - in fact this is what people did in Cuba. USD basically just took over because 1 USD buys 1 USD worth of goods no matter what, it always held its value, and locals simply began transacting those instead.

So the pecking order falls down into USD &gt; Gold &gt; Cryptos for a myriad of reasons - at least at face value. There's discussions around an authoritarian government, maybe that cryptos can assist with, but in that situation, I think you have more pressing problems (government intervention on commerce), and the less liquid crypto market (relative to USD and gold) would be even harder to convince someone to take your troubled money in exchange for their comparatively stable virtual assets.

All in all I think it can work, so it is a fair point. But why would you opt for it when you can have a capital flight straight to the USD (which is basically what these individuals want to hold) and even if you preferred cryptos, would the local infrastructure be there?",1525234236

"&gt; Without segwit. If we reach 100% segwit adoption the fees will continue 1 sat/byte for a very long time.

Segwit still doesn't give a very significant capacity increase, it's at most what, 4mb blocks effectively? 

You know who Joseph Poon is, one of the original creators of the Lightning Network, he said BTC will need 133mb blocks ([proof-1](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability_FAQ#Doesn.E2.80.99t_Lightning_require_bigger_blocks_anyway.3F), [proof-2](lightning.network/lightning-network-paper-DRAFT-0.5.pdf)) in order to handle worldwide capacity using Lightning, just for people to open and close lightning transactions. Poon said BTC will have to fork to increase capacity anyway.

How does a mere 4mb help you when that's already 32 times smaller than experts on Lightning say you're going to need?

BTC will have to hardfork. But didn't you just say you didn't like hardforks? 

Do you honestly think BTC/LN can do global payments with 1mb and segwit and never need to hardfork?

You said you are worried about RVer controlling BCH, even though he's not a dev and has not control over anything.

But you don't seem particularly worried that Blockstream literally employs multiple Core devs and that Core has kicked out all other mining implementations and the Core devs now quite literally control BTC. Frankly I'm far more worried about development centralization on BTC than I am about what nationality is mining my chain.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;You just don't like it? Is there any particular reason beyond aesthetic preference?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, Brazilians can't afford 100mb blocks to run a full node.

Ever? Again, Joseph Poon says BTC will need 130mb blocks, so how does this claim help you? 

And why would everyone need to run a full node, where did you hear that claim, who told you everyone had to run a full node? Satoshi did not say everyone needed to run a full node. Did you read the whitepaper, because it talks about SPV clients in the original whitepaper, which allows for non-full nodes.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;In what way. It's not better currently than BCH transactions or many other altcoins, it's not faster, not easier, and not cheaper either since it requires an on-chain transaction to get money onto the 2nd layer.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; If you study LN you can see it's way better than other options because the financial support is the powerful hashrate in the world.

What does that mean? The financial support is the powerful hashrate? I think there's  a word missing.

Have you not read the criticism that the Lightning network looks like it has a communication problem, because all nodes need to broadcast their channel state and balance to all other nodes all the time. This create an exponential communication problem.

Some have estimated that LN will top out somewhere between 10,000 to 1m nodes. That is why others have proposed a 3rd layer on top of Lightning to try to solve this problem.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;What's wrong with hard forking? Have you simply accepted that not hard forking is a good thing without actually thinking about why?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; How many hard forks bitcoin cash have already?

Two, the original that created it, the last was last November, and the next is in two weeks, and another scheduled in November. No big deal.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;Not hard-forking means the protocol is going to stagnate for the next 20 years and will never be able to do more than it can right now. That's not how technology works. Do you think the HTTP protocol is the same way it was 20 years ago? It's not.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Segwit adoption helped to decrease the fees and all without forcing a hard fork.

That is because they put an artificial 75% fee discount on segwit transactions. But we're nearly a year out and segwit adoption is only 35%, and most of that is because a couple of exchanges finally started using it. You've split your userbase. Is your argument that segwit is good but if you aren't using segwit then 'fuck you we don't care about you'? That's a horrible thing to do to non-segwit users.

Would you support a soft-fork that limits space in the block for non-segwit transactions. Like let's say we reserve 75% of every block for segwit transactions, would that be good or bad?

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;Ver doesn't control anything, you're speaking propaganda that you've swallowed.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, he and his allies control bitcoin cash.

How? No one can 51% bitcoin cash. And we have multiple independent development teams, non of which are on Ver's payroll. Where is your claim coming from?

Meanwhile, Blockstream quite literally pays multiple Core devs, and you don't seem worried about that at all. Why is that?

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;On what possible basis? Bitcoin is not cheaper, not faster, not easier.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Cheaper? I buy for more but I can sell for more.

I'm saying bitcoin transactions are not cheaper, not faster, and not easier than BCH transactions. I'm not talking about the coin price.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Faster? Is already very fast. 1 sat/byte = confirmation in next block

You forgot that the Core devs put a 3 second delay into the BTC protocol, purposefully making BTC transactions slower. 

BCH devs took that 3-second delay out, and payments now are nearly instant on BCH.

BCH transactions are much faster than BTC transactions, and will always be faster, because BTC does not want to hard fork, and they would have to hard-fork to change this.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Easier? Yes, very easy. Take a look at goods wallets for Android like Samourai Wallet. With a lot of privacy improvements.

It's not very easy to do a BTC transaction, you have to understand the difference between segwit and non-segwit. You need to know how to estimate the right transaction fee or else your transaction could get held up for an entire week or longer. Some people last year had transactions that didn't go through for a month. I had one that took a whole week, and I used a $5 fee.

Then we have Lightning. People have to understand that only a segwit coin can pay into lightning, no regular non-segwit. Then they have to figure out how to fund a channel and do everything on lightning, how not to get ripped off by using watch-towers, and how to close channels.

It's not very easy.

Here's a guy trying to do a Lightning transaction. It took him nearly 4 minutes and the Lightning transaction failed, demonstrated by a BTC believer who went to a bitcoin meetup where Roger decided to make a bet with him that he couldn't even make a Lightning transaction payment work:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgjUXi6XXFc

Here's a BCH transaction, nearly instant transfers, total process less than 30 seconds

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BF_ycdI4oF4

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;Apart from the hate compaign against BCH, what actual technical reason is here to not use BCH and use BTC instead?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; BCH is very weak compared to BTC. 

This is just an unsupported statement. In what way is it weak at all? BCH is faster, cheaper, simpler. What is left that BTC has? 

&gt; Bitcoin Core team is way more competent in my opinion.

Competence is judged by the performance of the software. BCH's programmers have made a cryptocoin that is faster, cheaper, and easier to use than BTC / LN.

Who told you the Core team was more competent anyway? Do you think Gavin Adresen is not competent? He was the leader developer trusted by Satoshi Nakamoto to be the leader programmer on bitcoin BTC. And he now supports and develops for BCH. Is that not competence?





&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Good developers stay with Bitcoin.

So you think Gavin is not a good developer? That can't possibly be true. 

And why do you think this anyway? Is it a rule somehow? Where is this rule written? 

Just because people made a few memes about this or that programming mistake, you think BCH devs are dumb? 

What will you say when BCH surpasses BTC in daily transactions, when more people are using BCH than BTC? What will you say when BCH passes BTC in price one day?

Since you are an ancap you should be good at spotting propaganda from people who have not thought everything through. That is why most ancaps no longer support BTC.

And as for Brazilian ancaps, if they still mainly support BTC it may be because people like you are still supporting BTC even though the rest of us do not anymore. You should know that numbers of supporters mean nothing to an ancap. Numbers don't make you right.

Have you read these histories on the scaling debate? How long have you been following the cryptocurrency scene? I've been here since 2012, reading daily. These articles I agree with very strongly, and many ancaps will agree with these too:

"Although I agree with you in the short/med term, part of my speculation stems from the potential future boom in adoption from newcomers introduced to crypto not through speculating btc price, but through projects who's focus is to bring in the masses with a use case.

"**Gaslighting**

Gaslighting is a form of manipulation that seeks to sow seeds of doubt in a targeted individual or in members of a targeted group, hoping to make them question their own memory, perception, and sanity. Using persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, and lying, it attempts to destabilize the target and delegitimize the target's belief.

Instances may range from the denial by an abuser that previous abusive incidents ever occurred up to the staging of bizarre events by the abuser with the intention of disorienting the victim. The term owes its origin to the 1938 Patrick Hamilton play Gas Light and its 1940 and 1944 film adaptations.

But the more useful a particular blockchain is, the more valuable it is, and thus becomes a larger target of attack. The blockchain's coin/token/crypto is its way of defending itself; rewarding honest actions and making attacks more expensive. The value IS the security, and without the value, there is no security. 

Secondly, as shady as the USD is, it's one of the more trustworthy currencies on earth. It's backed by a massive security force and huge economy, and integrated into all of the world's financial systems in a fundamental way. However, most people on earth who know about, or will know about bitcoin, will be comparing it against their local currency. You hate XBTUSD, but how would you feel about BTC vs your local currency in Japan, Kazakhstan, Venezuela, India, Congo, Russia, England, Greece or Germany (very different views on the Euro)?

"EOS tokens represent network space on the EOS blockchain. In simple terms, the value of the token should reflect the value of the network. In order for DApp developers to operate on the EOS blockchain, they will need tokens. In addition to owning network space, your EOS tokens gain you access to airdrops built on the EOS blockchain and may be rentable to DApp developers in the future. From this perspective, I think it's very significant that Block.one has committed $1B+ through its VC partners to develop DApps on the EOS blockchain. This is also extremely timely given the current SEC threat to the ICO space - DApp developers can receieve funds without risk and EOS token holders will directly benefit.

"I agree. I would argue that even the point of ""sound money"" is subject to argument. In my opinion, ""soundness"" doesn't just come from technology, but from how widely spread it is.

Gold as ""sound money"" could only succeed because there are very few natural alternatives. Literally there are very few natural resources that can be used as money even if gold all went away today.

However in a world where the ""artificial scarcity"" is a solved problem, anyone can create their own chain, which equalizes the scarcity factor for all existing cryptocoins.

What's left is how secure it is, how lasting it is, and how widely it is used. BTC seems to be focused on ""lasting"" and ""security"", which is fair. But I would say that there's a chance that ""widely used"" can overwhelmingly trump the rest two by introducing more talent into the ecosystem who will end up building all kinds of solutions to implement ""lasting"" and ""security"" qualities.

One uncomfortable truth about mindless BTC believer (I'll use this term to refer to people who are just mindlessly believing in BTC instead of making an informed decision, 99% of people on BTC side are mindless BTC believers I would say) is that, to them it doesn't really matter what 2nd layer solutions end up abstracting their ""sound money"". It could be lightning, it could be sidechain, and if all of them fail, that's still OK, because they can always get banks to implement the 2nd layer. As long as ""adoption"" happens, their BTC value goes up. It doesn't matter if the end-user interface is centralized or decentralized.

What I find really appalling about this is that most of these people are just free-riders. They didn't do shit, other than spending most of their days trolling on Twitter, etc. They are not doing ANY work. Yet they think they deserve all the wealth just by holding BTC and pushing propaganda so that their asset value goes up.

You can see this through how a lot of them behave online. A lot of the ""bitcoin rich"" people have this ""I don't give a shit"" condescending attitude towards others. Nowadays they even openly say Bitcoin is not for poor countries and it's for small number of ""woke"" people, what a condescending arrogance.

I wouldn't be so angry at this if these people actually are working on something to improve BTC or if they're building anything for BTC. But no. They literally do nothing, and they yet look down on others as if they are some monarchs of the new age, when all they had was a luck and irrationality to invest in some speculative asset before other people found out about it.

This is why I despise most of mindless BTC community even though I also own BTC. Most of them are bunch of free riders who just want free money by deceiving others.

The proponents of ""sound money"" are free riders. And a community of lazy, condescending, and arrogant free riders cannot win against humble, inclusive and proactive people who actually want to change the world, and actually DO something instead of just sitting around counting their baseball cards.",1525231594

The TLDR of the video is basically that it is easier to put a valuation on something that has a ""product"".  Things that don't have a working ""product"", or only have a test net (EOS, for example) has much more speculation behind it because there is nothing tangible to put a valuation on (only future expectations).

"if you have a mac then you might be able to open a terminal window and type
&gt;shasum -a 256 someFile.txt 

Where ""someFile.txt"" is a file on your computer. Anyway that gives you an output like 97666fccb9c7117fdc549a60a747ce01085cbd39f596503fe749c59870429ed7

Now try changing something in someFile.txt (add a letter or space or carriage return) and then re-run the command. You'll get a completely new output.

Now keep doing that till you get an output that starts with a bunch of 0s like 0000000000000000000e3d92186b347a2fa05bd0c969ec6906a26cf383eb3fef

That is basically what bitcoin mining is, except that miners do a double sha256, they do it billions of times a second, and instead of someFile.txt they use a block header which contains:

* a version number
* the previous block header hash
* a merkle root hash (this is where the transactions come into play)
* a timestamp (and it can't be too far in the past or in the future)
* nBits (the target or roughly, kinda sorta, how many leading 0s are required)
* a nonce ( a number miners increment just to change the outcome of the hash just like you added something to someFile.txt to change it)

Anyway that gives you some idea of what is going on. The merkle root hash field is itself made up of hashes of transactions. So each blockheader is specific to the set of transactions that will go into the block.

"&gt;Users were already paying $50 transaction fees a few months ago. What doesn't make sense? If BTC keeps adding more users, they will surely end up paying $100 transaction fees at some point.

Without segwit. If we reach 100% segwit adoption the fees will continue 1 sat/byte for a very long time.

&gt;You just don't like it? Is there any particular reason beyond aesthetic preference?

Yes, Brazilians can't afford 100mb blocks to run a full node.

&gt;In what way. It's not better currently than BCH transactions or many other altcoins, it's not faster, not easier, and not cheaper either since it requires an on-chain transaction to get money onto the 2nd layer.

If you study LN you can see it's way better than other options because the financial support is the powerful hashrate in the world.

&gt;What's wrong with hard forking? Have you simply accepted that not hard forking is a good thing without actually thinking about why?

How many hard forks bitcoin cash have already?

&gt;Not hard-forking means the protocol is going to stagnate for the next 20 years and will never be able to do more than it can right now. That's not how technology works. Do you think the HTTP protocol is the same way it was 20 years ago? It's not.

Segwit adoption helped to decrease the fees and all without forcing a hard fork.

&gt;Ver doesn't control anything, you're speaking propaganda that you've swallowed.

Yes, he and his allies control bitcoin cash.

&gt;On what possible basis? Bitcoin is not cheaper, not faster, not easier.

Cheaper? I buy for more but I can sell for more.

Faster? Is already very fast. 1 sat/byte  = confirmation in next block

Easier? Yes, very easy. Take a look at goods wallets for Android like Samourai Wallet. With a lot of privacy improvements.

&gt;Apart from the hate compaign against BCH, what actual technical reason is here to not use BCH and use BTC instead?

BCH is very weak compared to BTC. Bitcoin Core team is way more competent in my opinion.

What for? That's anyone's guess. But don't come on here playing the innocent when you have a very biased opinion on the topic.

Please, again, give me some (any at all) evidence that it was supporters of BTC (your opposing team) that reported you. Give me a thread telling people to mass-report BCH promotion, a telegram screenshot of something similar, give me a thread on /r/bitcoin that states that you are doing good by silencing BCH supporters. Anything at all. Anything that supports your rant, because without it, it's a baseless attack on BTC supporters, the exact thing you're ranting about.

In what way. It's not better currently than BCH transactions or many other altcoins, it's not faster, not easier, and not cheaper either since it requires an on-chain transaction to get money onto the 2nd layer.

What's wrong with hard forking? Have you simply accepted that not hard forking is a good thing without actually thinking about why? 

Not hard-forking means the protocol is going to stagnate for the next 20 years and will never be able to do more than it can right now. That's not how technology works. Do you think the HTTP protocol is the same way it was 20 years ago? It's not.

Now what? If you're telling me a ""real person"" solves the dispute in an impartial manner, then how is this any different from Escrow.com or any other escrow service?

"I don't think you can compare Bitcoin to EOS. Bitcoin is attempting to become a digital store of value and may or may not need high TPS numbers (think gold). The EOS token gives you ""virtual real estate"" on the EOS blockchain so you can run DApps.

If you are going to argue for complete trustless decentralization like what Bitcoin and Ethereum have to offer (putting aside the massive mining consolidation currently taking place), I have to bring your attention to the fact that many if not most DApps built on Ethereum simply don't need that level of decentralization. EOS and the 21 delegated supernodes will be more than sufficient for 99% of DApp developers. This allows Bitcoin to fill the void for trustless, decentralized ""money"" - again, something EOS is not attempting to replace. 

Finally, EOS has built a community of developers and mining pools (not an easy feat). And like it or not, Block.one has committed $1 billion combined with VC funding to promote even more development on the EOS blockchain. The argument that once ""the next new things"" comes around, everyone is going to abandon EOS doesn't recognize the power of not only the community but the ability to finance decentralized startups without them risking SEC and other government scrutiny in the ICO market.

You obviously don't like the project which is fine, but IMO, I don't think you have really looked into the project with a willingness to understand why it might be successful (and that the recent price movement just might be legitimate).

"The limit was raised to 4MB of weight last year . 

Here are the concerns with too large of a blocksize \- 

The primary resource concerns in order largest to smallest are:

1\) Block propagation latency \(causing centralization of mining\)

2\) UTXO bloat \(increases CPU and more RAM costs\)

3\) Bandwidth costs [https://iancoleman.github.io/blocksize/#\_](https://iancoleman.github.io/blocksize/#_)

4\) IBD \(Initial Block Download \) Boostrapping new node costs 

5\) Blockchain storage \(largely mitigated by pruning but some full archival nodes still need to exist in a decentralized manner\)

This means we need to scale conservatively and intelligently. We must scale with every means necessary. Onchain, decentralized payment channels , offchain private channels , optimizations like MAST and schnorr sig aggregation, and possibly sidechains/drivechains must be used. 

Bitcoin has gone from a network 7 transactions per second and confirmations taking between a second to hours \(10 min avg Poisson distribution curve\) to \~14 TPS onchain and millions of TPS with instant and secure confirmations with LN channels.  ",1525227414

"""$100 transaction fee""

makes no sense

""What libertarian Bitcoiners who hold the views above are fundamentally advocating is to build the exact same type of gold-standard-like two layer system that failed so hard in the 19th and 20th centuries. Only this time with a digital asset instead of a physical asset as the base money.""

Digital vs physical is a real difference.

Btw I don't think this comparison is good enough because anyone can run an LN channel in the home without need too much money for that.

The cost is almost zero and the government can't control that. 

In the other side, gold can be regulated and controlled by the government very easy.

I don't like the ""increase the block size"" approach to reach the goal of low fees. Segwit, Schnorr, Lightning Network is way better and no need to hard fork every time and control all the power like Ver does right now.

Minority hashpower realized that bitcoin is not actually supposed to be a settlement layer for Lightning Network, and so now we have two forks, one which is the original, real bitcoin (Bitcoin Cash/BCH) and one that is not bitcoin (BTC). So Core was taken over by a bunch of scammers, who are now using the bitcoin name to try and benefit themselves.

BCH is and always was bitcoin. It had to create the name Bitcoin Cash in on August 1 order to differentiate it from the scam that is currently using the ticker of bitcoin fraudulently.",1525226446

18.2\) The first is a confirmed con\-artist, who tried to impersonate Satoshi Nakamoto w/ false \(delirious\) claims, fake digital signature, fake pre\-dated blogposts &amp; PGP keys. Every single con attempt was publicly debunked. Purpose? Visibility, but also patent\-trolling vs Bitcoin.

18.3\) The second is an Asic monopolist \(I actually hope not for long\), connected w/ the Chinese government, who is playing since years an obvious monopoly troll\-game against Bitcoin, completed w/ kill\-switches, backdoors &amp; covert optimisations built on stuff sold to other people.

18.4\) The third is a pathological, narcissistic liar, who was caught lying about not using sock\-puppets &amp; who spent the last month spreading fake news &amp; FUD vs Bitcoin &amp; using his online channels to defraud newbies, selling them Bcash while they where looking for Bitcoin.

18.5\) There're actually other, embarrassing minor characters in that pathetic circus, one more ethically questionable than the other, from the ""bamboozled"" disgraced former developer Gavin Andresen \(who supported the CSW fraud\), to academic\-plagiarism\-hero Emin Gun Sirer, etc.

18.6\) Only someone extremely stupid would think this kind of brigade could really replace Bitcoin as the new private, censorship\-resistant, global, sustainable, digital gold standard. To think that Bitcoin could be replaced by an altcoin, for whatever reason, is generally stupid.

18.7\) Even if Bitcoin was really doomed by some convoluted conspiracy \(16\), any attempt to replace it would fail \(6\). But EVEN IF one really went down this road, literally ANY other altcoin \(maybe ""big\-fast\-blocks"" LTC?\) would have more chances than the embarrassing scam Bcash!   

19\) For all these reasons, I think you're either stupid or malicious. I hope you don't take this as a personal offence. I don't think stupidity is ""genetic"": I think it's mostly a choice, some kind of intellectual dishonesty/laziness. People can stop being stupid. You should",1525226132

https://www.bitcoin.com/info/what-is-bitcoin-cash
https://www.bitcoin.com/info/what-is-bitcoin

It is our belief that Bitcoin Cash _is_ Bitcoin insofar as it is the closest version of Bitcoin to that described in the original Bitcoin whitepaper. We feel that it has more 'right' to the name Bitcoin than the Core development team's implementation of Bitcoin, hence the term 'Bitcoin Core'. Although perhaps using the term 'Bitcoin Segwit' would have been more correct in a technical sense as once Segwit was implemented via soft fork it became a different version of Bitcoin, albeit the one which had the longest chain, with most proof of work.

BCH is indeed an upgrade as it upgrades the network's transaction capacity with a reduction in fees as a byproduct of that. There is nothing at all misleading about calling a spade a spade, or in this case calling an upgrade an upgrade. I wasn't involved in the decision making process in relation to the terms on the block explorer so I cannot comment on the thought process behind that, but Bitcoin.com is a privately owned business and a privately owned website; as such, it is the entity which owns it - and only that entity - who gets to decide which version of Bitcoin they would prefer to support, and how they support it.

The difference between the two cryptocurrencies is made very clear to users before they attempt to purchase either, and misleading people is not and was never Bitcoin.com's intention. Our intention was and is to support Bitcoin Cash as the true iteration of Bitcoin, and work hard to help undo the damage that has been done by the Core development team's drive to turn Bitcoin into a settlement layer rather than peer-to-peer electronic cash available to _everyone_, from the banker in a high rise apartment in the first world to the farmhand in a home built from scrap in the third world.

I can see how there may have been _potential_ for confusion, but to say that we intentionally misled people when we provide information about both cryptocurrencies prior to purchase is a big jump indeed.",1525224461

Perhaps you would prefer that I call Core's implementation of it ""Bitcoin Segwit"" as that is what it forked to?

With regards to structure, I want to keep it minimal as the information is more important than the visuals, one link one (very) short description. I am prioritizing project categories based on how I feel both developers and casual users would be interested in, I really want to focus on apps (and web-apps similar to mobile apps). 


For devs.cash I am asking the following questions: 
1. What are some popular/fun/interesting projects, and can you earn Bitcoin Cash on them? 
2. What else can Bitcoin Cash be used for?     
3. What if I **am** a Dev and want to get involved? API's, Tools, etc!     
4. Maybe I don't understand or I am new or not a Dev but I still wanted to see what this is all about, so what can I learn? I've scrolled now past the projects, but an informative link catches my eye near the end of the list! Great!    
5. If I am Dev I want to add my project quickly/easily, how do I do that? Answer = Big button at the bottom and likely already have a reddit account.     
6. I added a small download button for the most updated version of the website list, the reason I added the download button is so that simply there is more chance a copy of the list info is somewhere on another computer too, the more the better.
7. How do I get more involved with the ""developer community""?


So regarding some feedback, the structure is great, but maybe there is a way to order the list in a certain way that focuses on the path a newcomer would want to take, So something like 1. get basic info, 2. join community, 3. learn wallets, 4. see projects to earn or buy, 5. learn exchanges/converting/mining, 6. in-depth stats/links/etc

"So the miner actually only cost 600 USD in parts. People who paid 1 BTC for it will get back 1 BTC minus 600 USD in Skycoin.

1) This is one way for Skycoin to continually raise fund. Instead of doing one massive ICO at the very beginning, they are doing it gradually as the ecosystem grows. This kind of spending is much more natural. If you know the start-up scenes, you might know that many start up fail because they got a lot of money at the beginning and never learned to be frugal with spending. They spend far beyond their ability to bring in capital and eventually fail. 

I am willing to bet this is going to happen to a lot of these ICO's in the next year where they all just go bust because turns out they don't know how to make any money. 

2) This is only the first batch of miners. There were only 300 of them because we are still in the testing phase. We are not meant to scale yet because it's still the testnet. At the same time, during the testnet, you will actually be able to mine and earn rewards and because of the early miners will get a lot of Skycoins like people who mined BTC when it was pennies. They will be able to earn that 1BTC back easily. 

3) This is the most important one. You can and it is ENCOURAGED to make your own DIY miners. The official miner is only there to act as a benchmark with the most optimal set of specifications for running the Skycoin ecosystem. There are so many CPU boards we can use and it introduces a lot of variables which makes testing really hard. By having a benchmark, we can ensure there will be at least 300 standard miners that can do the testing properly. 

If you actually come into the Skycoin community, you will see that the DIY miners scene is extremely active. That alone should make you so bullish since the level of technical discussion is clearly leading in the entire crypto scene. This is what ETH and BTC was like back in the VERY early days. The quality is literally on the other end of the spectrum as Tron. 

In the future, when the testnet is a bit more stable, you will begin to see all sorts of DIY miners with different components participating on the network. 

At the same time, there is already an official 1 node miner being developed that will be sold for around 50 USD for noobs to plug and play where people can buy, plug in to their home network and have default VPN for the entire home network. ",1525221816

"We are not misleading people at all. We make it very clear using tickers which cryptocurrency is which, and we make the exact same amount (2.5% of the amount) when a user purchases BCH as we do when they purchase BTC.

It is our view that Bitcoin has been crippled by 'second-layer scaling solutions' which do little to actually address the situation of high fees and full blocks. This in turn is detrimental to adoption and reduces the use cases of Bitcoin, particularly as a fast, cheap method of transferring value.

It's not enough to have low fees and quick transactions _some_ of the time, which only _some_ people can afford. Bitcoin Cash brings Bitcoin back to what it should be (particularly compared to a soluiton like the Lightning Network) - peer to peer electronic cash with instant transfers which cost virtually nothing.


Speaking as someone who has been in the Bitcoin space since 2011 I **love** Bitcoin. I've breathed Bitcoin since the very first minute I found out about it, and I've been absolutely in love with it since! It's absolutely world changing and I wish that no hard fork had been necessary, but it was necessary. Bitcoin has been morphed into a settlement layer by vested interests, namely Blockstream, with a lot to gain financially by doing so.

I'm not here to beat down on Bitcoin at all. It's just not the Bitcoin that I've put everything into over the past 7 years, and its promise has been dulled under the chains of 'second-layer solutions'. We're promoting something that we believe is the right option to returning Bitcoin to its original use case; peer-to-peer peer to peer electronic cash with instant transfers which cost virtually nothing, available to all.

Lots of people will disagree with that and that's absolutely fine, in fact it should be encouraged! That's the beauty of open source development and the free market at work. We need to let the markets decide over time which cryptocurrency has the most utility. In 5 years time that might be neither Bitcoin nor Bitcoin Cash, it might be something else entirely, but we should all be working towards making whichever version of Bitcoin we believe in the absolute best that it can be. To me, full blocks, high fees and centralisation in the form of the Lightning Network just doesn't fit with my view of what Bitcoin is and what it should be going forward, that's all.",1525221391

For example, what stops a quantum computer from playing around with transactions in an old block to, say, modify the recipient of the mining reward, and then find a combination of values in header/transaction body to create the same hash that was calculated in the initial, valid block? Since there are so many possible Bitcoin wallet addresses, they could treat that as the nonce and iterate through unused Bitcoin wallets as the miner destination.

Now that's a really good point. I haven't thought about it too hard, but off the top of my head, I do know it's possible to set up a smart contracts/DAO with it's own native currency. With this native currency, they could create out of thin air a theoretically infinite amount of tokens. And just like in fractional reserve banking, they can set the limit to some multiple of of how much ""real"" money(like BTC or ETH) is in the smart contract. So if people invest 100 ETH into the DAO, then the DAO could be programmed to lend out a max of 200 ETH equivalent or whatever.

"&gt; The amount of coins in circulation isn't affected by the size of a block. If I am wrong please enlighten me. Because the supply of coins is not affected by size of blocks, I don't see how it artifically keeps supply low

You're not wrong.  
  
Most conversation focuses around the *supply of coins*.  We know if a big player comes and buys up a ton of those coins, then the available supply goes down.  As the supply goes down, we know that the demand will increase, and the price goes up.  In the reverse, if there's a sudden influx of supply of coins, then the demand decreases and the price drops.  
  
However, there is also *supply of block space*.  Every (approx) 10 minutes there is 1MB of supply available.  Of all the people who want to make transactions, there is a limited 1024 byte supply - it is all there is.  Suppose under the same scenario someone were to ""spam"" the network, thereby eating up the supply.  There is still demand, but there is less block space supply, so *transaction fees* go up.  
  
If you're making money off of bitcoin, you may not have billions and billions of dollars to sink into absorbing the coin supply so you can push up the price.  But you may, just may, have influence over the development of Bitcoin, and if you do then you can affect the block size supply.  You can keep that supply low so that demand pushes transaction fees up.  And if you can collect money on transaction fees in this way, you don't even need to spend the go through the hassle of absorbing the coin supply.  
  
If this is what is happening, why would they ever raise the block size?",1525219492

What are you talking about? BTC consensus is *not* broken. You literally change what your saying every other comment.

&gt;everyone? where? i said that the majority of the community, as determined in forum polls from 2015, were in favor of big blocks. i started my crusade against corporate for-profits in core dev in 2014 with warnings of their intentions. that eventually played out with the beginning of the blocksize debates which hit Spring/Summer 2015 b/c of Blockstream, like i warned. but the first push for big blocks came from several of us in a small little sector within BCT. just when you were a little boy. kinda like you still are.

Ad-homs aside (you really can't help yourself can you?), you seem oblivious to the fact that the blocksize ""debate"" more or less extends back to 2009. Also, just FYI, I've been in Bitcoin since early 2013, not that it matters.

"&gt; I totally agree with you, no idea why your post is down-voted this much.

If you attack other people's investment, they hate that shit. Simple stuff, like I'm about to attack your Nano investment. 

Did you know how Nano was distributed? People did fucking CAPTCHAS online. That's how you got your Raiblox. There's absolutely no fucking way to know who knows what. 

Now you can argue that's not much a problem, since the same applies for Monero. But Monero wasn't just given to people that do captchas all day long. How much do the devs on for example, is a question you will never know for sure in Nano. 

Another thing with Nano is their claims are far from the truth. Nano has had stresstests, and these tests did reveal drawbacks in that claimed TX/s amount wasn't even close to what was originally claimed. Nano is fast, but not fast enough, really. 


Use Litecoin, if you want cheap transactions. No captcha bullshit, nothing their shit works. 


Use Nano if you want to speculate and *potentially* make more money. Litecoin is the safeplayer, where you can transact with 1 cent and it's also very fast. And it's decentralized, which Nano isn't. And it's working, reliably working for years, Nano isn't. And their founder Charlie Lee has no stake in Litecoin, we don't know how much Blox are owned by Blox creator really. You need more? I'm not a fan on Nano either. 


Stellar is the exact same centralized bullshit Ripple is, so I don't see how that's better at all. But again, it's a shitcoin, and shitcoins pump hard, so you will make good money if Bitcoin rises in value. Sure. But is it a good project? Hell fucking no it isn't. 12 billion of coins in circulation currently, are owned by the devs, which is 60%, which is the exact same amount Ripple Labs has frozen in XRP. Same shit. 


&gt; My list is valuable projects is: Ethereum, Nano, Stellar, Bitcoin, Cardano, Monero, IOTA, Binance Coin and Qtum.


You do realize that these coins only go up in value and 10x, 15x, 50x, if Bitcoin does well over time and recovers? 

You know which coin you're not holding at all? The coin responsible for your shitcoins to pump. You're not holding any Bitcoin. You're part of the shitcoin investor problem we have in Crypto and it's a big part why the current bear market might extend for 4-5 more months. 


It's because everybody wants 10x and nobody wants 30% from Bitcoin, despite Bitcoin being among the only products that actually work and is used in the real world. 


&gt; From top 10, I think Tron, Bitcoin Cash


Exactly. Tron, EOS and Bitcoin Cash are the scams in the top 10. Nice spot. Avoid these at all costs, or speculate with them for a short time period to make money ,fine. 

Even centralized Ripple will work fine as long as Ripple Labs allows it continue working. But Bitcoin Cash? For all I know they might dump that shitcoin any fucking second. 


You also mentioned IOTA. I have IOTA myself, but purely for speculation, that idiots will buy this trashfire project thinking blockchain is now boring or something. Their shitty software doesn't fucking work mate. They use a coordinator to do snapshots of the network, because they fucking know themselves that it currently doens't work. They have no such thing as a wallet that stores keys. Nothing. You have a CEO who says ""I hate speculators, I hope you're all losing your money, IOTA is backend"".  So is the riota sub mashines now? Are mashines trading your iota on exchanges? Are machines giving your iota trash project value? No it's fucking humans.

"I linked you the source for exclusivity, what more do you need? 

This article states:
&gt; At launch, Yoshitaka said SBI Virtual Currencies will support bitcoin, ripple, ethereum, bitcoin cash and other cryptocurrencies.

If you connect the dots between the two articles, it's pretty clear that SBI is bullish on XRP and owns a stake in Ripple, so they would like the most out of this as possible, therefore exclusively listing XRP as the base trading pair. The ""and other cryptocurrencies"" was the big giveaway for me, as there's no way they would add that if we were talking about base trading pair. Imagine this as a Binance with XRP trading pair and fiat gateway. 

If all goes as planned, I see no other way than this being a great deal for XRP, but also for the market in general, as it makes buying coins a simpler process for Japan.

I am (clearly) invested in XRP as well as other coins/tokens, and I would still promote to be skeptic about articles and discussions with random people on reddit.

Now, a decade later, I very much regret it. I would like to get on the train, but I feel like there are so many options now compared to back then, that it is a bit overwhelming to pick. I don't mind about risk in itself, but I am sure some currencies look more promising than others to veterans.

I disagree. If they were open to this possibility it seems very likely they would have done it when a capacity increase was actually *needed* several months ago.  Or at the very least started discussion.  Instead they banned people from talking about it.  
  
This whole topic isn't even technical, it's simply financial.  In bitcoin you have supply and demand of both coins (BTC price) and block space (tx fees).  If you can absorb the supply of coins so there is less supply, and there is demand for coins, then the price will go up.  If you have power over the core development of Bitcoin, then artificially limit the block size so that supply is low.  Low supply + high demand = big fees.

"anyone who think that bitcoin without some kind of scaling solution will function as a payment instrument is deluded. 

we have 2 options for now. until something better presents itself which I doubt.

**Behind door number one:** Flexible block size! blocks have to be large enough to contain all transactions that anyone would want to do. the clear disadvantage with this is that for anyone to verify the legitimacy of a transaction would have to download petabytes (yes, you read that right, thousands of terabytes) of history. which would lead to a failure of decentralization. it also comes with the clear disadvantage that any pending payment would have to wait for the next block to be mined before being accepted which would take minutes. and that is best case scenario. currently the rule of thumb for most vendors is to wait until the payment is at least 5 blocks old before accepting it.  

**Behind door number two:** some kind of an off-chain solution! instead of tying every single transaction to the block-chain there are many other individual block-chains that keeps track of peoples payments and then after some time execute all these payments as one sum of it. This solution is not entirely explored yet, we don't know what works and what dosen't work. The technology is as of yet not fully explored (I don't think). However, I do think there are a few disadvantages that this would bring with it. The full extent of these disadvantages is yet to be determined. It is worth noting though that these disadvantages would be exclusive to those actually using the off-chain solution and anyone who wishes to use bitcoin without this is free to do so.

personally. I don't think door number one is an option. we need something like Lightning-Network on top of the bitcoin protocol to act as bank-notes like bank-notes used to be to gold. bank-notes were not gold, but it were proof of ownership of gold and was therefore valued as such. sure, LN have a lot of flaws. it has weaknesses that can be exploited to steal others funds. but, carrying around cash that could very easily be taken from you was the way of life for decades. yet, very few people would save all their money at home in a box. We have to accept that with security comes inaccessibility and with accessibility comes insecurity. bitcoin is as safe value can be. you'd have to spend eras finding something that doesn't belong to you. LN is the middle ground for small everyday payments. yes, when you buy a car or a house for bitcoin the vendor might insist on doing it directly on the main block-chain and wait that day for confirmation in the interest of security. but when I'm ordering a sandwich at subway the transaction have to be close to instantiations and have a reasonably high certainty of actually getting confirmed.

If we don't find a working off-chain solution then bitcoin is doomed and will remain as a rumor that is (lets be honest) mostly used by criminals to stay anonymous.",1525216909
"&gt; banks can face huge fines and reputational damage if they are complicit in allowing their customers to launder money

I think you should look up the definition of money laundering before posting any further.

Buying bitcoin is money laundering only if the money you use to buy the bitcoin is the proceeds of a crime (*and* if you further use the bitcoin in other financial transactions while concealing the history of how you bought the bitcoin_.

In this case, the bank showed no interest in where he got the money. Therefore they did not suspect that his money was the proceeds of a crime. Therefore they did not suspect money laundering.

Whatever the source of risk, money laundering was not it.

There could be other sources of risk. For example, they might have suspected that he would use bitcoin to buy illegal drugs with. That is not money laundering, it's buying illegal drugs.

There are a lot of stupid people out there who think that the only reason anybody would want cryptocurrency is to buy illegal drugs with it.

Yeah the debate has moved on in the other direction. Attempting to have the debate with the minority party (BCH) is rather conciliatory, is it not? Given that your on the losing end (market-wise), I would think that you would be eager to try to win over people from the majority side.

That makes no sense. A quick glance at hashing power and mining pools would put that argument to rest. (this is what I just don't understand, why are you guys just making up lies that are easily verifiable? It seems like a fool's errand.)

&gt;Threads like this prove it - people actually want working electronic cash, and Bitcoin CAN deliver, despite the boring arguments to the contrary.

Uh what? Tippr TXs are not on-chain so what are you even talking about? Also, how much use does that bot even get? By the looks of it, very little and confined to BCashers.

&gt;Research is advancing (e.g. Graphene), whether BTC cares or not.

Who's hiding? This is just complete fabricated nonsense. First of all I'm here (Hi!) and also take a look at the top comments on these threads here. All I here is baseless accusations that BTC proponents are ""shivering"" and ""afraid"" and whatnot. It's a circlejerk to the nth degree.

What are you talking about? I responded to a question. Am I not allowed to respond? (cough cough censorship cough cough).

Sound money is huge like you said, and I believe once we get to a place where the market has agreed on a price, and merchants don't have a fear that there could be a 50% drop at some point in the future, we will see a massive influx of merchants. 

Especially so when the time that happens merchant solutions will be very polished.

1. The push to claim the name bitcoin cash. This is a further attempt to divide the community based upon existing divides. The cold hard fact is bitcoin cash did not achieve majority hash rate when the fork happened. By the standards of hard forks, this means it cannot claim the name ""bitcoin"". It was not accepted by the community; aka it did not achieve consensus. 

2. The push for never lightning network/second layer scaling solutions. Some people here are clear minded and say they are open to the technology when it works, but there are people involved in bch that continue to push this propaganda.

"Hello Mr Fenton,

I do not know how well versed you are with securities, but what is your take on the SEC's scrutiny on cryptocurrencies? Do you believe that the US may be setting themselves up for disaster if they decide to 'officially' adopt/endorse a single or small handful of the cryptocurrencies? If the rest of the world does not agree with whatever currencies they deem 'OK', could we see those currencies become worthless and, in turn, US entities holding these currencies losing large amounts of wealth? With NASDAQs interest in becoming a crypto-exchange, would it be fair to assume that we could see a massive wealth transfer into cryptocurrencies, as we saw in 2005/2006 with the housing market? I could see the US attempting to keep such a situation under wraps by keeping value artificially propped up, as they do today, but I do not have a background in finance or trade and my tinfoil hat is too large for my head, so a practical opinion would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you

You aren’t going to replace them with a currency. They LEND currency. The currency doesn’t matter. This is why Venmo hasn’t replaced credit cards. How are you gonna get a mortgage through bitcoin? No liability fraud protection? Cash advances for a month? You aren’t. Bitcoin doesn’t replace credit cards, it replaces cash. And cash has already been replaced by credit cards because they provide multiple advantages over cash. It’s not just about being digital, it’s about the services the cards supply. 

For instance, I went on vacation. I got ripped off by a hotel owner. I called my bank, I got my money back. With bitcoin, I’d have been defrauded. With a bank, I wasn’t. I’m not going to give that up for no reason. ",1525213451

"These are very clearly fake reviews. To address the three that are shown in full one by one:

_""Shinra Holdings""_
Bitcoin Cash was not created in part by the wallet's developer / author, nor by Roger Ver. It was created by hard-forking the original Bitcoin (with Segwit) chain and this effort was led by Amaury Séchet with absolutely no creative nor development input by the wallet's creator.

It is not at all possible to lose any Bitcoin sent to any Bitcoin Cash address in the wallet as you can very easily create a Bitcoin wallet from the Bitcoin Cash seed phrase, instantly recovering the BTC. Ergo the statement that ""Millions of dollars have been lost to date"" in the wallet is entirely false - in fact it is not even possible to lose funds within the wallet by having Bitcoin sent to an address in the Bitcoin Cash wallet as you, and only you, have full control of the private key to that address. This makes recovery a very simple process and we even have step by step instructions for this in our Wallet Support FAQ should anybody make this mistake.

We also have wallet support available via email 7 days a week to assist users if necessary.

""amafuji""
The explanation above applies to this fake review also; $130 did not go ""down the drain"". If perchance it is not a fake review and the situation did indeed occur then the $130 was sent to an address which the user holds the private key for, and thus they can recover their funds with ease.

""Novacek Michal""
The wallet allows you to create both BTC and BCH wallets so yes, it *is* a real Bitcoin wallet. Furthermore it is not possible for the wallet to steal funds as it is an entirely non-custodial wallet, so the only person with any control over their funds is the user herself/himself.",1525213195

&gt; When you don't batch, almost every transaction creates two outputs, one for the payment one for change.

The thing is that if Bitcoin adoption was growing you'd see more of these type of transactions. Lots non-batched transactions means that individual people are spending their Bitcoin on goods and services. As apposed to companies like Coinbase using batching to provide withdrawals. My point here is that people using their bitcoin to buy goods and services (non-batch txs) is a much better signal of adoption than people moving the bitcoin between their wallet and exchanges (batched txs).

the fact is, you have no evidence to back that up.  it sounds intuitively logical to you so you believe in it, 110%.  that's fine but i think you're wrong.  if users worldwide adopt Bitcoin, THAT would be the true definition of decentralization; which is why i asked you to define it.  you couldn't.  i then proceeded to give you the hypothetical, which is just as valid as your logical fallacy, that even if full nodes were limited to datacenters, financial institutions, merchants, and gvts, that would still be considered decentralization even if not one full node were in the hands of an ordinary user.  that's b/c Bitcoin forces everyone to compete for it as a coveted asset, even at institutional levels.  and that is all that Bitcoin needs to survive, which is what we all want presumably.  having said that, i also told you that early adopters such as myself will also be fabulously wealthy in the above scenario so that even i could easily afford a full node in my home.  or a datacenter if need be.  there are 8M of them worldwide.  it's not a problem.  there will be plenty of non mining nodes out there regardless.",1525211731

I personally don't think that crypto can delay it's adoption to wait on tech to be on par with current systems before we push for mass adoption.  
I think that adoption is needed to drive the development and get it sped up enough to catch up and overtake the current systems that we have.  

I think that adoption and tech push each other.  
More adoption, means more minds will tune into the crypto space, means faster progress, means more adoption means more progress, etc.  
As long as out of all the people that join the space there are enough people that understand the importance and necessity of trust-less solutions over trusted ones the progress on the trust-less front will speed up in tandem with the increased adoption.  

But yes the scary part is if the ""trusted"" parties will start to fight that progression to hang on to their power, but luckily that in itself can cause progress to be made on the trust-less front which would have to find ways to bypass whatever was come up with to stop them.",1525211179

The problem I’m seeing for Ethereum is that most DAapps built on the Ethereum platform don’t really need trustless decentralization. And since Ethereum is at least 9 months away (at best) from PoS and currently running at 100% capacity, I simply can’t understand why new developers would want to launch on the Ethereum platform given its current scaling issues, especially if they don’t even need Ethereum level decentralization.

"Wait a sec. how does using Japan as an example help your argument?
Hey 
Japan’s Yen is not a reserve currency of the world, therefore it’s debt levels don’t matter. Which then allows it to be remain functional. “Functional” is not a standard that the USD should aspire for. 

To say that government debt doesn’t matter would be like saying they can just print their way to solvency and it should be no issue whatsoever. But if that were the reality, then they should have already printed trillions of USD and have gotten rid of the debt earlier and perhaps the US would have gotten its triple A ratings back. 

A reserve currency like the US needs to have some value backing it up... not just the “we’ll only make good on the interest payments” forever argument. That doesn’t seem to work well whenever Congress debates raising the debt ceiling. Which itself is quite laughable because we have representatives debating something they don’t really understand. Which then puts a dent in the whole “faith and credit of the US government” part that supposedly gives the USD it’s value. 

Financial crisis happpen because of this mess of a monetary system where everyone just keeps kicking the ball down the hall, hoping it gets resolved in the next generation. But that’s an illusion. Not when China, Russia, and others see US debt levels as a major weakness which they can exploit by simply dumping their US treasury bonds.

Not when the only response will be to print as much USD as possible, raising the prices of commodities everywhere..... including Bitcoin. ",1525210328

"&gt;So if you're mining Bitcoin are you actually processing the transactions? How does mining work on crypto coins that have little to no transactions? How can the miners still receive regular block rewards for mining if there's not enough transactions to fill a block?

Mining reward has two components: fixed reward and the sum of all transaction fees. So if there are no or few transactions, miners still get the fixed reward which is independent of number of transactions.

And the ""complex"" math problem is neither complex nor a problem. It's a simple and well defined algorithm (SHA256) comprised of a series of simple operations. The math solution has no practical use (i.e. it's not solving to discover new prime numbers or doing protein folding calculations) outside of Bitcoin itself and serves as proof of work and proof that this work was done on specific set of data and is not valid on any other data - resulting in high degree of immutability (i.e. securing transaction data).",1525209172

And I would argue that this wasn't so much the case 2016, than the market we have right now. There have always been shitcoins, but at least prior to Ethereum, they forked or had their own chain. 


Nowadays people claim their selfmade ERC20, write some cool whitepaper and market that shit. Think that's a dangerous direction. 



When I look at EOS, I can't help but think it might be catalyst Crypto really needs. A wake up call to not throw your money at any shit that claims to god put into code. Maybe then people will start to question, whether or not certain shitcoins actually deserve that value. 



Seems unlikely to me though.

It's thanks to these shitcoins and EOS alike that we've still not recovered. How can we recover, if the main player is no longer getting the money, but at the same time we all need Bitcoin to do well. 



You understand my logic? 


How do we run past 12k Bitcoin, 20k Bitcoin, if it has to continue to fight ICO scams that amount to nothing.

"Posted this earlier in BTCTalk

I know this took me awhile to understand, so I will put it out there.

Approx 40% of the coins in circ will be ghost nodes, so about 760 after the initial 2.5 years. Nodes get 0.25% of privacy txs, and they are opening it up to be able to do a privacy tx with most any coin. The top 10 exchanges have ~$17B USD volume. To capture 0.5% of that market a DEX would need to be 1/4th the size of bittrex. If all of those txs are privatized, thats $212,500 per day in fees for the nodes. That's $279 per node per day in tx fees. They also get block rewards from each mined block (28% of the block). To me, these are all small numbers still, but even at that a node will make $138,556 a year.

Now just think of it this way, DEX's are the future, NIX will work to implement with all those DEX's, so it is very possible for some of your top exchanges to be a DEX. Change the market penetration from 0.5% to 10%, and a node is now making $5,592 a day. This is all with crypto still having ~$17B daily volume, if volume doubles over 2 years that's putting a node closer to $11,184 per day.

This is just showing my theoretical min/max situations in 2 years, and only with the DEX manager DAPP. This isn't including their ideas for SCM, or other DAPPS made by others.

IMO NIX will be huge, just on the node side. Add in the ability to privatize any chain, the private smart contracts, DEX manager, and other possibilities, and well, I have a hard time fathoming it. This very well could be the coin that rids us of a majority of others, as they won't have points anymore unless they evolve as well.

TWO: EXISTING MAJOR GLOBAL CURRENCIES WILL TOKENIZE - these will seem exciting at first but wiklmreally just be inferior fiat in a shiny new wrapper: centrally controlled and manipulated 

THREE: SOME PLATFORM COINS WILL HACE ACTUAL UTILITY FOR VARIOUS APPLICATIONS - a few of the good projects might actually work and serve to add value - how this translates into value for the coin is another matter - this is where I put EOS, ADA, ETH, ETC - I own all of these - 

FOUR: SOME MINOR CURRENCIES WILL EXIST AND BE TOKENIZED - special use / special purpose niche currencies for various applications will exist 

We prob alt won’t have thousands of robust blockchains but I think we will have thousands of tokens on a handful of major chains 

FIVE:  SECURITIES WILL BE TOKENIZED - NOT JUST CURRENT PUBLIC COMPANIES BUT MANY OTHERS -  tokens are a superior form of issuing equity - lots of doubters I know but I’ve tried to explain why I think this in several videos

"That is unfounded shit opinion right there...and that kind of thinking is applicable to every crypto currency.

Once again I am not some super ""Vergian Verge fam"" member who is all about the XVG. I am saying that if you want to pick at it.. pick at it about actual faults it has rather than creating things to hate about it.

Here ... Verge acts like the addition of I2P and Tor to their crypto currency is revolutionary... but any crypto currency can have those things applied to it by the end user. just Download [I2P](https://geti2p.net/en/) and [Tor](https://www.torproject.org), setup I2P and use it to access the Tor network and BOOM! whatever crypto you want is super private about your IP....

So if you can Use I2P and Tor with Monero... Why use XVG?

See that is how to bring up a fault about something and question it's validity.... not ""the founders are rich and pumping the coin"" when there is essentially no evidence of this. 

Worse that vaporware makes no sense... There isn't some gradient of crypto currency evaluation that starts on the good end with ""totally LIT"" and on the other side is ""Worse than vaporware"".

If you want to use the english language you need to use words for the purposes others use them for... you are using vaporware as a synonym for ""Shit"" or something.

That’s why EOS DPoS gives each node equal weight in the network.

DECENTRALISATION IS A PIPE DREAM.

For example the value of bitcoin is decided by whales. Ergo if the mt gox trustee (or power in the hands of money) decided to sell $9 million worth of btc then ultimately they have the power over the many as they can crash the market. How is that for a centralised position ?

Yes I know decentralisation also means no one can tamper with overall supply. But the big fish will always have the power and that is a form of the few over the many ergo centralisation.

For me ethereum is getting outpaced by leaner technology and all it has done has provided mobilisation for start up by a crypto currency.

They process Bitcoin transactions but in order to have the chance to introduce their block into the blockchain and claim the reward they also need to solve a mathematical problem. The purpose of resolving it is to show commitment in terms of energy (which costs money) making it really expensive for a miner to try to cheat. For instance if a miner tried to introduce fraudulent transactions in the blockchain he would have to spend a lot of money in hardware to solve the mathematical problem and the block would be rejected by nodes so he would not be able to claim the reward. If the miners were only processing transactions nothing would stop them from trying to cheat because they would not commit a lot of money and energy as is currently the case.,1525205746

"&gt; Bitcoin core is bitcoin on btc chain and is not referring to just a client.

...since Roger Ver said so, I suppose. Well, of course you can create your own truth, sure.

&gt; Bitcoin cash is bitcoin on bch chain and it has more than ABC client.

Just like Bitcoin has more than the core client.

&gt; You can fight against bitcoin cash as much as you want.

I do not want at all. All I am doing is getting things into perspective. Roger calling Bitcoin ""Bitcoin core"" and calling Bitcoin Cash ""Bitcoin"" is such a ridiculous step, that takes all credibility away from him in the overall Bitcoin community. That was too obvious of course, so he corrected it again. But also calling Bitcoin ""Bitcoin Core"", as he is still doing, is ridiculous, and I made this remark to point out why, by drawing the analogy to bitcoin ABC for Bitcoin Cash.

so Roger is the one attacking Bitcoin, not I am attacking Bitcoin Cash. you should know that. I am only critizising wrong and manipulative information. If Bitcoin Cash does its thing, I  am perfectly happy with it and I have no reason at all to ""fight"" it. On the contrary, it is good to have a playground for the camp that thinks on chain scaling is the way to go, and they shall do so with Bitcoin Cash and stop blocking Bitcoin's evolution (as they did wehn segwit was blocked), so it is good that Bitcoin Cash exists.

Again, to be very clear: I absolutely ENDORSE Bitcoin Cash's existence! But I despise the attempts to discredit Bitcoin, as it happens to be the case from some the Bitcoin Cash supporters, unfortunately.

&gt; You can spread fud and misinformation, but you can't stop us.

From what I said above, you'll understand that you directed this statement to the wrong person. Not applicable to me.

But I can tell you: YOU can spread FUD and misinformation about Bitcoin (as you just did by adopting Roger's narrative as your own), but you cannot stop Bitcoin.

Note that I am saying ""cannot stop **Bitcoin**"" and not ""cannot stop **us**"", as you can see. This is because I do not identify myself with Bitcoin (or any coin). You must have a strong self-identification with Bitcoin Cash and a strong opposition against Bitcoin, otherwise you wouldn't have written ""us"". So just because you are hostile against Bitcoin, it does not mean I am hostile against Bitcoin Cash. Do not make that false inference.",1525205666
"I am not and I actually wasn't the one that downvoted you. I agree with you to a certain extent and I still see value in EOS because it is currently way ahead in the scaling race. However in the future if Ethereum and/or Bitcoin fix the scaling issue and make it easy to run a node, yes I would run my own node to contribute to the network. I have also run an IOTA node in the past. That was an easy decision since transactions can be more easy to get through if you are running your own node. So given the current economic conditions of all the networks, I agree that EOS has a ton of room for success. What is now worrying me is what happens a few years down the road when a network solves all three (security, decentralization, and scalability). Some coins may still have a roadmap to get there, but the level of decentralization of EOS will always be capped to a certain extent. ",1525205636

I'm suggesting they don't want absolutely negligible increases to on-chain capacity that require them to change the way that they want to use the blockchain, when there are fairly simple ways to get very large increases in on-chain capacity that are not so demanding.

When crypto pumps up FAST sell 50% of coin. It will drop fast too!

"I look at Bitcoin much like Catholicism.  At some point in the distant past, there was The Church.  Then in 1054 there was the Great Schism, and we got two halves of a whole: The Roman Catholic Church, and The Eastern Orthodox Church.  Both Churches try to claim they are the true Church founded Jesus himself.

The same thing happened with Bitcoin.  We now have two halves of a whole.  We have BTC and BCH both trying to claim they're the ""Real Bitcoin.""  They share the same Genesis Block.  Their roots are from the same whitepaper.  And they both claim to follow Satoshi's vision.  Two halves of a whole.  Two approaches to try and solve the same problem.

"**Stockholm syndrome**

Stockholm syndrome is a condition that causes hostages to develop a psychological alliance with their captors as a survival strategy during captivity. These feelings, resulting from a bond formed between captor and captives during intimate time spent together, are generally considered irrational in light of the danger or risk endured by the victims. Generally speaking, Stockholm syndrome consists of ""strong emotional ties that develop between two persons where one person intermittently harasses, beats, threatens, abuses, or intimidates the other."" The FBI's Hostage Barricade Database System shows that roughly eight percent of victims show evidence of Stockholm syndrome.

It was formally named in 1973 when four hostages were taken during a bank robbery in Stockholm, Sweden.

"It seems you don't understand how PoW works. It's intended as a means for an honest network to exist. The ""majority"" applies only to the miners within a single network. So if you want to apply the Nakamoto consensus rules. There's two majorities of honest miners. A majority within BTC and a majority within BCH. With the current state of affairs it appears the share of dishonest miners is negligible. **There is no minority**. Both BTC and BCH miners are honest and are providing integrity to both systems. The integrity is equal.

You keep comparing BTC and BCH as a single system. Then you consider BTC the (honest) majority and BCH the (dishonest) minority. 

BCH isn't attacking the integrity of BTC. It's not attempting a 51% attack or trying to compromise BTC's ledger. 

So please stop abusing the words ""majority"" and ""minority"". They have special meaning in the consensus rules and imply honest and dishonest miners. 

I use ""support"" with regard to ""honesty"". If you're concerned about a 51% attack that requires a coordinated effort done by humans. In this scenario the motivations of those humans superceeds whatever hashpower is working for a network. If 90% of BTC's and BCH's combined miners are supporting BCH they will most likely not join a coordinated effort against BCH. They might however join a coordinated effort against BTC. ",1525203184

"So you call the contract a token?

Tokens in crypto means something different that's why people don't understand you. 

A token is something that represents value you are correct. But a token has a set value. 1btc=1btc or 1USDT=1$. It can also be sold to anyone, this contract that entitles you to btc is only valuable to you, since the contract spends to your adress, no one elses.


If you infact mean a token situation on LN I would send you x amount of tokens that are worth the same as y amount of bitcoin(maybe x=y) for some goods that you later can exchange for real bitcoins. If I purchase from you a second time I send you more tokens. This is how you believe it works but it's not. If it was then it would be in the code, but it's not. Something else could work like this, LN does not. You also didn't post any official LN-info about token, I wonder why. 

Last time I explain how it actually work.
Opening transaction. A 2-of-2 transaction that requires your and my signature to spend. I add 1 btc you add 1btc.

We type out a contract and we both get a copy. You sign my copy, I sign yours. If either of us wants to we can show this to the network and it would spend in the way the contract states. Right now I get 1btc and you get 1btc. The software keeps track of this amount so you know how much you have left.

I buy something from you for 0.2btc. We both agree, so we draw up a new contract, you sign my copy I sign yours. Now we both can show this new contract to recieve the funds in the 2-of-2 adress if we want to.

Note that you don't own anything more right now than you did before, no bitcoins no tokens that represents something, nothing. You do however own the proof that you can show to recieve 1.2btc whenever you want. You have a contract.

If we transact again, we do the same thing again but this time the contract states you have 1.4btc and I have 0.6 but nothing has actually happened other than us drafting a new contract and signing it. 
I wanna close the channel and you agree so we both broadcast the latest tranasction, all signed etc. When this is included in a block by miners you own 1.4btc and I own 0.6. 

This is what keeps track of the balances, words written. No token that represents value, a contract.

You have infact broken down your arguments very well, it's just not how it works. Something COULD work like that, LN does not.

Just post all the official info on LN-tokens if you wanna keep discussing. I hope atleast you tried to find it? ",1525203025

I think he uses Ripple as an example because XRP is actually being used today, whether its 1 company or 20.

That being said, Ripple has a clear plan to push xRapid on the financial institutions after they’re set up on xCurrent. Their reasoning is it’s an additional 30% in savings so why wouldn’t they?

Whether it actually happens, who the hell knows. 

I barely classify Ripple as a crypto currency but as a company, what they do is kinda fascinating so I follow them closely.

They definitely go against the ideology I’ve developed personally.

"I actually own both Ethereum and Ripple at the moment, so there's that for clarity. 

You explained to me, sort of, how Ethereum works and what it's qualities are, but I was really asking for specific examples of usage. What is your friend doing with it, business wise? How does it help him? 


How does it help others? Are these others actually using it for something, right in this moment? Because that's what it feels like to me. Ethereum offers ERC20, which are used for shitcoins. 


You *can* do more stuff with Ethereum and I never argued different. I argue that the people that *can* use Ethereum to a degree that it can justify a value of 60 billion, simply do not exist yet. I couldn't use Ethereum, even if I wanted to. I'd have to learn how to code, then thanks to the way they're build, there's a good chance that I fuck up not only my money, but other people's money aswell. Which gives me reason to use audited parts of Ethereum and I'm back to ERC20, the only tested application on Ethereum. 



I do know about NEO, what you seem to know about NEO. They're not trash like EOS in that they don't even exist yet. 


How do non-coders profit from Ethereum, besides being able to buy ICOs and speculate, is my question? How do non-coders benefit from NEO for that matter? Because anyone can *spend* Bitcoin. Anyone can use Monero and be sure that the tech behind it works. They actually use these Cryptos for something. 


Who is a non-coder, that somehow found use in Ethereum, without fucking himself and others up? 


___ 


You misunderstood my XRP point. I don't like XRP and I think it's a centralized shitcoin too. I just gave credit to where I think it's due. Some people *use* Ripple. That's the truth. Whether or not it attributes to their real value is not even that relevant. Is it at least used for something. 


Same with Monero. It is used for something, but of course spculation is part of it. There's speculations and those that use Monero for their activities. 


My point is that most coins out there, have no usecase and are *just pure speculation*. Relation wise, say Monero is 60-70% speculation and 30% real use. Whether or not these numbers are correct is also not that relevant, nor do I have means to prove anything. I can however prove to you, that is used on many different pages.



EOS has a case, where 100% is speculation and 0% is use. So do most other shitcoins. And I don't like that relation at all, thus I'm not a fan. 



Then I do the next best thing and try to decide which projects will moon most in the future. I then try and look at coins, which have great developers and a great vision. That's not Eos, that's Cardano. 

&gt; You give Ethereum shit for not having enough applications.


To make my point again. 



It can't have enough applications, because the people that can use this kind of tech simply do not exist yet. In 2-3 years, with Crypto having matured more, I'm sure usecases will start to come. 


But 2-3 years time ahead, but we're already seeing like what ... 10 different utility platforms? ",1525201802

I'm just saying that throughout all my time in crypto, I see these huge booms, followed by a lot of profit taking. even if the project is amazing, people seem to always take profits. Why? Because there are a bunch of people, who like me, don't know enough about EOS to make a market value assessment vs other coins.  they don't buy out of passion, they jump in because they know FOMO and a good pump can earn them money. When it slows down, they bail out, and buy the next one they see heating up. There are so many people like this, it's a problem with the market, but that's just something we have to deal with

No it doesn't, he was just doing maintainer tasks. How do you feel about him making the claim that Craig Wright is Satoshi ? Do you support this claim ?

&gt; Jesus this is painful to read. You can absolutely measure adoption using outputs. The data doesn't lie - Bitcoin's outputs/day was trending upward until the plague of high fees came thru at the end of last year causing merchants to drop support.

When you don't batch, almost every transaction creates two outputs, one for the payment one for change. Space is wasted for the additional output and for the signature to spend it in a subsequent transaction.
When you batch, each transaction creates many outputs, at most one of which is change. So asymptotically batching halves the number of outputs created for a given load.
Batching can also reduce outputs by combining multiple withdraws into one. E.g. Alice withdraws 1 BTC to her wallet then 5 minutes later withdraws 2 BTC more. If the batch hadn't issued yet this just gets converted into a single 3 BTC output.

&gt; It's ironic that core supporters support decentralization more than any other aspect but can't seem to notice that the development of their beloved protocol is in itself centralized.

The Bitcoin ABC Github is a ghost town and all communications are done privately. Bitcoin development and discussion is fully transparent and we follow the BIP workflow that Satoshi followed.

Cryptocurrencies are not as easy to use, they do not scale well, they are more expensive to spend, their prices fluctuate wildly and many are completely public causing security and privacy issues.  


So what possible use case do they have? and which ones are the best?  


In regards to the issues mentioned above, traditional payment processors have cryptocurrencies beat. Credit Cards, PayPal, Facebook, and all of those allow for the near instant transactions of a fairly price stable currency with fees ranging from free to 2.8% + $0.30. These transactions are only visible to the payment processor, the end users and of course the government.  


Cryptocurrencies may be a decent competitor to international bank transfers that often cost $25 and can take days. However, this exposes you risk because they are so volatile, and USD to Crypto to EUR (or other) likely incurs fees that could cost as much as an international bank transfer.   



Cryptocurrencies are however revolutionary because they are decentralized, trustless and permissionless currencies.    



This isn't always useful, but there are some situations where it is extremely useful:   


When you are dealing with high risk transactions, being subversive, or disobeying governments.

"Best way to invest in crypto on $50k job

1) live beneath your means!!   That’s super important for everyone — from $10k to millionaires - you must save and billions of ad dollars want you to buy crap you don’t need with money you don’t have — don’t fall for it — people can live on 20k — so save all you can 

2) that savings should be split into baskets - one for short term, one for fun, one for long term, retirement etc — allocate based on what percentage you want to spend (___% of my salary will go toward retirement — ___% will go toward a fund for that boat I always wanted)

3) then you invest those baskets based on time horizon for each goal - so for the retirement basket for example if that is the longest timeframe you account for this and design a growth oriented portfolio 

4) then you asset allocate those portfolios based on your goals and risk tolerance and the timeframe listed above — you make a pie chart showing what percentage of the assets in each basket will be in what category:  stocks, cash, mutual funds, venture, and crypto 

5) within the crypto category you have a certain amount to work with — allocate that carefully — I strongly reccoment avoiding most ICOs and sticking with the larger and more serious projects —

6) re-evaluate and adjust in each category 

7) rebalance when one category outperforms the others 

Be careful, cautious and well informed - be patient, make a plan and stick to it. ",1525201020

"&gt; I don't think we should refer to LN as fractional reserve banking

It's not fractional reserve banking, it's a fractionally reserved blockchain.  They are slightly different but with similar qualities.  Think of it this way, if a blockchain is what backs Bitcoin and originally the blockchain stored all transactions on the blockchain, then because Lightning only stores a fraction of the transactions on the blockchain by definition it has fractionalized the blockchain.  The issues caused by fractional reserve blockchains are congestion failure which can lead to loss of funds on the main blockchain as well as a freeze to all payments on the main blockchain, which is similar to bank runs.  The other problems with fractional reserve blockchains are the fact that smart contracts are no longer possible.  For example with BCH if I buy some Pepsi at the store there could be an RFID tag on the Pepsi I buy and if the Pepsi bottles make it to the recycling center since that RFID tag is linked to my address, they can make a payment to me instantaneously.  However, if you tried this with Bitcoin Segwit, when the RFID Pepsi bottles made it to the recycling center if they tried to link it with a transaction on the blockchain the transaction it would link back to is a Lightning Hub transaction that also is clearing thousands of other people's transactions.  That means the recycling center has no idea who to reimburse because all they know is that it is one of a thousand different people they need to pay.

I know this topic is nuanced, but by definition if a blockchain is what backs Bitcoin (like how gold used to back the dollar) and you fractionalize that blockchain in the name of scaling then you have just made your blockchain a fractionally reserved blockchain.  This is why we can't have 'peace' with the BTC side.  Don't get me wrong, I want them to use the correct Bitcoin as well, but I'm not going to accept a blockchain that is fractionally reserved.",1525200842

"Neo is not pretty much Ethereum it is different. 

Programing language wise they are similar enough for most people to not really notice a functional difference (note: second hand knowledge from a friend who works with Ethereum so I might be wrong / might have misunderstood them) but their consensus implementations are completely different.

NEO uses Byzantine fault tolerance to achieve consensus and sort of has a staking based reward system through it's other crypto GAS. Ethereum uses Proof of Work and soon will be moving to a hybrid Proof of Work + Proof of Stake system (PoS system called Casper).

Ethereum is more decentralized in it's network when compared to NEO --- this isn't necessarily a good or bad thing depending on what you want ...it's just very different ( personally I prefer decentralization).

NEO is newer than Ethereum and is in the process of becoming more usable (although it is MUCH more finished than Tron, Cardano, and EOS and NEO is currently a working product).

Ethereum is already a complete programming language and there are many projects it is being used for that have nothing to do with ICOs or Crypto Kitties. Off of the top of my head I know the Canadian government is using Ethereum for property title management and for transparency with government grant records; multiple state governments in the United States started using Ethereum for land/propertity title management as well.

Neo is competition to Ethereum but I don't know enough about the differences between the programming languages they use to point out major differences

I do know that NEO has said that it's goal is to be the backbone of a new ""smart economy"" while Ethereums main gola is just to be the most complete programing language to facilitate the creation of decentralized applications on what it calls ""The Internet 3.0"" (which is just a bullshit fancy way of saying decentralized applications). 

NEO and Ethereum don't have to kill each other to continue to exist, both will most likely continue to have uses. (just like C# and Java didn't eliminate the uses for C++, C and ASM)

You just were shitting on everyone else about hype and it seems like you don't really do much in the way of research which means most of your information is from hype....and your posts driven by your emotions more than information...are a form of hype.

You also claimed that Ripple was one of the ""real deal"" crypto currencies... when it is an extremely centralized over hyped project. 

XRP is a crypto currency to facilitate a service offered by the Ripple corporation called XRapid yet every piece of news that comes out about Ripple the company is treated like it is about their product XRP. A solid example of this hype is when the Ripple corporation helped American Express create their own blockchain andddd American Express doesn't use XRP at all in their blockchain...but did it push up the price of XRP? YOU bet it did! ...and everyone was on reddit going nuts for it!

Currently 10 companies are tesing the use of XRP and only 1 implements it in their daily buisness. If you add the total value of those companies up I don't think they are 30 billion dollars. Why is the payment solution used only by 11 compnaies (well 1 really the other 10 are testing it) worth more than the combined total value of those companies?....becuase XRP is hyped to hell and people think when they buy XRP they are buying stock in Ripple the company.

You give Ethereum shit for not having enough applications... XRP is only for one thing XRapid transfers. XRP is possibly the most centralized crypto in the top 10. More than 95% of XRP is held in the top 100 wallets and they only have ~60 trusted validatior nodes (compared to Bitcoins ~12,000 or Ethereum's ~16000 validaton nodes). Ripple made the XRP validatior nodes software available for anyone to run... but when you run it you only connect to existing ""trusted validator nodes"" and you don't actually validate anything... because your node isn't ""trusted"".

Bitcoin core chose a way to push the problem further in the future, it is different.

1- this delay is surely small enough so that it is highly improbable that the last miner will come up with another block during that time window;

"Data can be misleading. 

Yes, in 2017 from January to December, most Altcoins did way more than 20x. Way more. 


But I'd argue that train of 2017 has sailed. Before 2017 really, it was Bitcoin or Shitcoin. That drastically changed 2017, didn't it? 2017 was the year of Altcoins. 


But I think it's questionable to assume that things will just continue to roll this way. Why is that? 


Well, first off, it's easier to pump coins, that have no market cap. Ethereum and Ripple both now have a substantial market cap themselves, making them a lot harder to pump. 

So you're looking elsewhere, not Altcoins, but shitcoins beyond top20. Coins that could be scams, air, nothing, or the next best thing. 


It is also thanks to 2017 and Ethereum starting to spit ICOs, that we see madness the likes of EOS, that don't have anything launched at all, but a testnet, valued at 15 billion dollar. 


 Now I don't claim to know all that much, but that looks dangerous to me. 



___ 



Overall I'm somewhat sceptical about the future because of this, actually. 



Because the original argument for many is that ""Bitcoin has worked for nine years, why would it stop now?"" 


That shit is in question now, because the reason Bitcoin might not rise like it always has in the past, because people after holding Bitcoin for two weeks, think they're brilliant investors and start throwing their moeny in shitcoins that are really nothing but air. 


That's why Bitcoin struggles. 



And that's sadly also why Altcoins struggle now, because the base frontrunner is exhausted, so to say. 2017 is not going to be like 2018. 



That said, your beloved 8000% yield will not happen in 2018, because Bitcoin  didn't 20x in 2018, we're lucky if we end 2018 at 50k Bitcoin, which is still plenty room for Alts to keep growing, but it does show a trend towards things slowing down. ",1525200382

Jesus this is painful to read. You can absolutely measure adoption [using outputs](https://outputs.today/). The data doesn't lie - Bitcoin's outputs/day was trending upward until the plague of high fees came thru at the end of last year causing merchants to drop support.

&gt;dogecoin has more transactions than bcash.

Dogecoin was started more than 4 years ago. Bitcoin Cash is less than a year old. The fact that BCH has a similar number of transactions as DOGE is impressive. 

&gt; you can no longer count transactions as lightning network

The number of transactions on the LN is a drop in the bucket. Until the LN is fully capable it will remain insignificant. 

&gt; Who is Bitcoins leader ?

Bitcoin doesn't have **a** leader - it has leader**s**. Every coordinated effort in existence has one and can't function without one. That doesn't mean that there needs to be one glorious leader that we follow until the end of time. That means that _someone_ has to take the initiative and step up every so often.

"For reference: here's what the 4New president said. I'd love do hear any reactions to it the folks here may have. 

Yes i am aware of your half hearted due diligence attempts to verify certain information in regards to the auditor and accounting firm. My name is Saransh Sharma and I am the president of 4NEW. Firstly, I cant begin to fathom what motive someone would even have to lie about their auditor or accountant. 99% of the ICOs out there don't even highlight this information. We chose to do so because it is true. Furthermore, to answer your question about why we have accountants and auditors in the US, the case point is very simple. We are in the midst of purchasing a publicly listed company in an effort to create the world's first crypto/stock hybrid. This is deep financial engineering that most average folks cant even begin to wrap their minds around. A reality in which a stock/crypto hybrid can exist. Consequently, SEC requires the public companies be audited by US accounting firms. So while all ICOs are running away from US jurisdiction, we are one of the guys heading towards it. Nevertheless, your naivety and swiftness to allegate strong accusations is rather immature. The reason you were blocked from the group was because you distinctly stated that you wouldnt be purchasing anything. Despite that you came into the group with a subversive tone. Furthermore, I suggested a phone dialogue and you denied, perhaps because you didnt want to hear the other side. You already had a version of events in mind that you wanted to sell on this thread to mislead and misguide other members. Anyways, to each their own. I wish you all the best. Should you have any further questions, I will be thrilled to address them here for you and the group. However, last I checked the world still operated as innocent until proven guilty. And from your feeble due diligence efforts and as an officer of the court that you are, it is sad that this moral impunction was ignored by you.

Also, when you open an account with an auditor or an accounting firm, KYC is required. Same is true if you are trying to form a company. Therefore, it isnt out of the ordinary that an individual be pegged to the account to manage a relationship when dealing with corporate affairs. I would try to spin any kind of benign conspiracy theories on this front. Moreover, if you actually browsed the website carefully, you'd find me still on the website.

You might not like EOS, but they are trying to address the mass adoption/enterprise problems through compromise - 21 delegates, parallel chains, governance, etc. I personally believe it will give Ethereum a run for its money because it will be the first enterprise smart contract chain to go live. And given the simple scale of projects being developed - many not necessarily needing 100% decentralization (or decentralization at all) - it's hard to believe that they would choose to build on Ethereum over the faster, transaction free, EOS blockchain (which also happens to support C++ for enterprise developers).

No; no it is not.

&gt;*The majority might not be mining on the chain they support. *

For various definitions of _support_, perhaps that is true. However, for the meaning of _support_ which can be demonstrated and measured through the application of Nakamoto consensus, the act of extending the minority chain _supports_ its I future consistency and integrity. If these miners have some preference in the supremacy of some other chain, diverting their limited capacity from support of the minority chain is detrimental to their private desires. A future consistency which depends on the support of these dual-minded miners is of exceptionally low confidence.",1525198656
"Well, demand in the case of bitcoin is interesting because a single bitcoin can be broken down almost infinitely, this is part of the reason WHY bitcoin is allowed to rise to the heights that it has and why the tech is so revolutionary. 

If nobody was trying to buy bitcoin over the course of the next hour and everybody was trying to sell, in theory the price would drop until you found a buyer. 

It's borderline impossible for bitcoin to every dip below $1000 dollars because of the buy orders on the books that will buy up the bitcoin at that price and drive the price back up. In other words bitcoin is fairly stable (believe it or not) 

The other side of the equation, that isn't mentioned by OP but is equally as important in determining the price, is the SUPPLY side. What's happening is that everyone is buying up bitcoin and holding it, this restricts the supply, and when someone goes to buy there's fewer people willing to sell, and so, in theory, the price increases until you find someone willing to sell bitcoin at said price. 

The way bitcoin works is that miners are getting rewarded every 15 minutes or so, most of those miners are selling their bitcoin almost immediately to pay for the cost of mining. This keeps the system generally in balance and the price relatively stable. But when the HALVING happens, and all of sudden they're getting 3.25 bitcoins instead of 6.5 every 15 minutes. You'll see the new supply GREATLY restricted and the price will likely skyrocket, and people see the price rise more people will want to buy, and this will increase demand for an already more scarce item (this is what we saw over and over again when prices rose to a dollar, one hundred dollars, one thousand, ten thousand, twenty thousand and so on, and it will just continue happening)

Now acc. to your theory all payments would have to be rolled back, incl. the payments that Carol and Dave received 2 months ago.

So I am 100% sure that this theory is wrong, because if true, it would render the complete Bitcoin blockchain unusable, because no receiver of Bitcoins (Dave, Carol, ...). could rely on the Bitcoin payment being final, not even after 1000 confirmations.",1525198618

"&gt; It isn't tokenized though.

Yes it is. You require some currency, token, coupon, voucher, value, sea shell to transact within the LN channel. This is tokenizing your stake within the LN channel.

&gt; LN works with unbroadcasted 2-of-2 (BITCOIN)transactions. https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Multisignature 

That's for opening and closing the channel. It's like saying a phone call is dialing a number, picking up, saying hi followed by hanging up.

&gt; They have been part of bitcoin since forever.

We're not talking about on chain. 

&gt; We keep track of our individual funds between you and me in the contract 

YES BINGO. You did it! There you go. Now this ""**Tracking**"" is a form of ""tokenizing"" or ""quantifying"" my stake of the funds in the LN channel. I could sell these ""sea shells"" to someone else for 10% less bitcoin if I wanted the BTC now and didn't want to wait around for the exit signature. You take the sea shells and pay them. This is the LN-BTC Token, because it derives its value from the underlying stake/asset of btc locked up in the LN.

&gt;  I know eclair shows a little symbol infront of you LN balance but this is just a representation of how many of your bitcoins are available at your side of the ""shared account"" it's not a token. Sorry.

I'm sorry but if you look up the [crypto definition](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/crypto-token.asp) you'll see it quite clearly says: 

&gt; tokens represent an asset or utility

This value represents the underlying BTC asset. Honestly I don't care what you call this value because I'm not interested in entertaining your rethoic nonsense. Just agree this separate value can be sold for a different price than the underlying BTC asset within in the channel.

&gt; I've tried my best to explain to you and I'm gonna have to asume that you are trolling at this point.

I've broken this point down where a 4 year can clearly understand it. I think you do get it, and because its so trivial you don't want to admit how silly you've been so you attempt to bury it in unrelated nonsense such saying LN is just an ""open close"" event or eclair value isn't a ""token"" of the bitcoin in the channel.

I think you are getting stellar confused with ripple. While their codebase is similiar they are ran with completely different goals in mind. Ripple has been designed in a way that will mainly only make money for ripple. Stellar has been designed mainly as a way to get around banking restrictions IBM was having for some of it's charities in small countries. The local population is too poor to have any sort of banking so they are using the stellar network as a way to more cheaply and provably get money to those in need since many of them do have internet access. I don't think that stellar is an amazing investment because there is no way to make a dividend on it and the fees are too low. It's main purpose so far has been to cut banking middlemen out of cross border payments to save money on transactions. I think what they are doing is good because of this and the protocol is one of the fastest and most tested currently available in all of crypto.  ,1525197886

"&gt; Bitcoin is the biggest shitcoin, don't get me started on BTC.

Please start. 

&gt;  I will always love Ripple for allowing me to quit my job but still, shitcoin. 

Green numbers = good. Ripple is a centralized shitcoin, but at least I would agree it has active usage right now. It's not an air project. So long as Ripple Labs operates, Ripple will work aswell, which is fine by me really. 

&gt; Monero is the only one worth half a Damn for all the druggies out there.


You assume Drugs is the only time people will want to hide a transaction? Crime is bigger than drugs, it's money laundering, it's human trafficking, terrorism, all that stuff. That said, it's up to you whether or not you support Monero. I do, because the usecase for anonymous cash will *never* cease to exist. I support from their activity by holding. 


&gt; Honestly Litecoin isn't even worth mentioning.


Why not? It's a working product, keeps being adopted as the alternative to Bitcoin. Can implement Lightning to keep being cheaper than Bitcoin forever, pretty much. Is decentralized. Has greats devs. Founder is not invested/cannot dump the coin. Is second/third most decentralized coin in the sphere right now. What's your problem with Litecoin? 


&gt; That's not what convinced me but rather his confidence in Vechain as well as his pure conviction.


So, since you cannot answer me what I can use Vechain for right now, why not tell me what I can use it for in the future? :D 


Vaporware dude, just 3x long Bitcoin, it's the same thing. You don't have to support pump of dumps of other people mate. Open the position of 3x Bitcoin and you will yield the exact same returns you would yield, if Bitcoin were to explode right now and you held Vechain. 


Just because it sometimes makes you money, doesn't mean it's good. 



You did notice, that every single Altcoin out there, outperforms Bitcoin when it's rising right? Why not invest in a real project instead, that's not marketing based, but tech based instead, like Cardano? They're actually working on shit.

If that's the case it means means BCH has more integrity even though BTC has more hashing power. 

So the bottom line is. Miners who are dishonest to one chain aren't necessarily dishonest to another chain. 

The 51% attack scenario comes from a coordinated effort. The motivation of such an effort can be politically towards a specific chain which is singled out.

Gaving wasn't writing any code, he wasn't even in discussion on IRC or on Github. He was parading himself around as the leader of bitcoin and at that time the CIA was snooping around. He was just a security liability. His commit access was revoked not his ability to help the community. If he wants to contribute there is nothing stopping him. Many developers are anonymous. 

Vitaliks ideas were simply not the direction the bitcoin community wanted to go in. His ideas got peer reviewed and rejected because the Bitcoin community wanted to head in a different direction focused on hypersecurity. Luckily.


&gt; All these people should be furious with the direction of Bitcoin - adoption, outputs, and transactions are the lowest they've been in a long time. Clearly something is wrong with Bitcoin's current vision.

You can't measure adoption. Outputs are not a an accurate measurement for anything, and you can no longer count transactions as lightning network is live on mainnet.

"XVG isn't vaporware because it works... [vaporware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporware) is when a product is announced and never gets created.

XVG a patchwork quilt of other crypto currencies code and improvements (like SOOOO MANY OF THE ALT COINS). XVG works because the code they copied from other projects works.

Is it good? Not really ... other projects that were clones of Bitcoin or other crypto have all kinds of new ideas/products/services. 

Examples:

Vertcoin is an ASIC resistant version of LTC that has a project called Lit box which is a plug and play lightning Network Node and their community is going to release a open source piece of mining software build in ASM + OpenCL optimised for AMD GPUs. 

Komodo is a Zcash clone that focuses on atomic swaps and smart contract integration with the privacy of Zcash and an option to turn off and on privacy for individual transactions (like XVG).

XVG doesn't do anything new... it just clones crap from other currencies and makes claims that the things it does are somehow unique (like privacy as a choice...which is offered by MANY other crypto and isn't unique to XVG at all).

The amount of hate XVG receives is very disproportionate to what it is. It's not a scam...it's not vaporware...it's just woefully mediocre and wayyyy over advertised. 

XVG partnered with Token Pay and currently they are buying a Bank in Germany to secure crypto debit cards that can't be taken away (since banks have been killing crypto debit cards). XVG also partnered up with Mindgeek (the internet porn monopoly company). With enough 
 support, money and developers even a patchwork quilt of mediocrity can turn into something valuable.

EOS is a unfinished product working on creating thew first steps to get it to a state you could consider ""alpha"" (not even beta) running on a test net....and it has a market cap which is in the top 10 (currently sitting with 15 billion dollar market cap at #5). I am not saying it will always be an unfinished piece of shit --- but in it's current state being worth 15 billion dollars on the idea that in the future they might create a crypto that has a chance to compete with Ethereum but currently it does nothing....is insane.

Cardano is a really well written white paper with a pre-alpha type implementation.....and it is in the top 10 as well.

Tron has a whitepaper that was a copy paste of other technical whitepapers and just launched a test net ~30 days ago and it's worth 6 billion dollars.

XVG is mediocre but it is leaps and bounds beyond those 3 just because it has a functional product.

Hype is the name of the game in this market because it is dominated by investors that know NOTHING about the crypto they invest in. Most people don't even bother to read whitepapers or look at Github repositories yet they have really strong opinions....like you with XVG being [vaporware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporware)..... which makes no sense.

"&gt; If there's a majority of dishonest miners within one network then it's less consistent as the other network that has a minority of dishonest miners within it. Regardless how big those networks are.

Partially correct. Bitcoin assumes the majority is honest. If that is not the case then the integrity of _all_ chains are at risk.

&gt; Thirdly. If the capacity of the smaller network is coordinated towards an attack of the bigger network the integrity of the bigger network can be compromised while the smaller network can just continue normal operations after the attack has succeeded. 

This is the exact opposite of reality. The coordinated effort of a minority cannot out-work an honest majority. They can participate in a suboptimal fashion, for instance by intentionly mining empty blocks, but that does not pose a risk to the integrity of the majority blockchain.

Conversely, a coordinated, dishonest majority _can_ out-work _any_  minority. A dishonest _super-majority_ can out-work _every_ minority, simultaneously. A chain which can be out-worked can have its integrity compromised.

&gt;Secondly. The total feasible work capacity isn't limited to either chain. There's plenty more capacity existing in the world.

I said _total measured work capacity_. There exists additional capacity but it is unmeasured. While such excess capacity absolutely poses a risk to the future consistency of a current majority chain, that concern is mitigated or offset by the evidence that as work capacity has been turned toward the measurable effort of mining, it has overwhelmingly been directed in support of the majority chain.

&gt; Fourthly. Making an attack is one thing. Doing it undetected is something else. It's nearly impossible. There is no evidence the integrity has been compromised. 

Nakamoto consensus does not provide the evidence necessary to prove to a future observer that a chain's integrity has been compromised. They have only the consensus of the majority to indicate that it has not. This is why it is necessary that a chain be constructed by the majority, as the consensus of a minority is less reliable. It is impossible to prove to the future observer that the demonstrable majority did not tamper with the constency and integrity of the minority chain.",1525194414

DAYLI Intelligence is partnered with SBI Ripple Asia.

""SBI Ripple Asia, the joint venture between Ripple and SBI Holdings, is going to test a blockchain-powered funds transfer system between Japanese and South Korean banks by the end of fiscal 2017, Nikkei Asian Reviewreported.

The trial will build on the experience gained from experiments conducted in Japan. For the payments experiment, SBI Ripple Asia will work with blockchain technology provider DAYLI Intelligence, a subsidiary of DAYLI Financial Group. They have signed a partnership agreement to bring Ripple’s enterprise blockchain solutions for cross-border payments to the South Korean market.""

Might ICX be one of the cryptocurrencies offered on the exchange?",1525194090

"&gt; Your compact block argument, though feasible at first glance, falls apart when you acknowledge that I already admitted my initial misunderstanding of eltoo

and

&gt; The reason your argument is a fallacy is because it uses the idea that compact blocks would replace Bitcoin which argues my earlier stance.


I was just clarifying my original argument (from before you acknowledged anything) that you categorized as a strawman. It's true that you later admitted misreading something, but I was not responding to that, merely responding to your accusation of me strawmanning your argument.

&gt; ""The typical straw man argument creates the illusion of having completely refuted or defeated an opponent's proposition through the covert replacement of it with a different proposition""

The way my argumentation was different from a strawman was because I was drawing a parallel, not saying you said something you didn't say. The validity of my parallel is debatable, sure, especially after your clarifications, but that doesn't make it a strawman.

&gt; For them to say, from the white paper itself, that LN has an insecure element that they’re trying to fix with eltoo

Minor nitpick: it's an academic paper not a whitepaper. Aside from that, 
I'm not sure where in the paper it says LN has an insecure element, could you quote that part for me?",1525194054

"&gt; Litecoin is one of the most useless coins out there with no use case that Bitcoin can't provide

That's not true. Litecoin is cheaper than Bitcoin currently. And since it will also implement LN, it will always be cheaper than Bitcoin. 


It's also second/third most decentralized currency in all of Crypto. That's what Litecoin is. Bitcoin transaction is currently 15-20 cents, Litecoin it's 1 cent. Monero it's 1,5-2$ per transaction, which is fine. 



Haven't studied Doge properly yet, so I cannot comment on that. I'd ask you questions about it, like how is Doge distrubuted among wallets, what's the coincap ( if it has one? ). I know transactions are extremely cheap in Doge, but everything has its price.

My entire point you quoted about Ethereum is not how Ethereum itself is overvalued, but how it simply has no real usecase yet, because the demand for Ethereum to exist, outside of ICOs, is just not there yet. I hope that will change in a few years, but right now there's not going to be any usage in Ethereum and that's it. 


My critique, and somewhat bitterness towards it, comes from the fact that it helps create air-projects like EOS, which are 15 billion large and don't offer anything at all. Ethereum made that possible. 


That's 15 billion not allocated in real Crypto projects, even if Ethereum is passive gainer of that, after EOS launches their failure project on mainnet, ETH themselves will no longer profit from it. ",1525193958

Now obviously i would like the lowest fees possible (i have used ""coinmama"" in the past), they will be buying via debit card, so it would be bloody lovely if i could do the process within an hour or so rather than spending the whole day over at my mates houses.

However, the market is too young to have all these things is my main argument. What do I mean by that? 


Well, most people simply have no use for Ethereum. The people that have use, are already in. Cryptographers are in demand like no other. The infrastructure for all of this is still being built, also by frontrunner Bitcoin. 


Real usecase for Etherum will hopefully be there in 1-2 years. Right now, it's spitting out ICOs and that's it. I hope that changes in the future. 




People are greedy is the problem and they don't see what Crypto used to be all about. They're all 100% Altcoins, when really they never amounted to all that much. 


A transaction in Monero is expensive, but you get something for it. That's a value proposition and it has usecases in the real world. People are willing to pay 1-2$ per transaction on Monero, because it offers what it does. 


People use Litecoin in some shops, because it's somewhat decentralized and because it's cheaper and faster than Bitcoin. 


People use Bitcoin, because it's the most widely adopted Crypto by far.

You equate an individuals use of the tools available to them as problems with the tools themselves.

You made a mistake:

Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Monero and Dogecoin

Litecoin is one of the most useless coins out there with no use case that Bitcoin can't provide. It feeds off the market as an early-in coin so everybody knows about it and would've never had any value if Coinbase didn't add it.

I'd say Doge holds way more value as a coin that positions itself as a joke fun crypto with no serious strings attached and it does exactly that. As far as tipping goes, Dogecoin is king.",1525192458

That's what happened with XT and Unlimited. Please do some research on those two clients and what happened with them (before Segwit and BCH even existed). In short, if Core doesn't want something to be implemented, it can't be done. This goes against everything Bitcoin was supposed to be, a permissionless system.

Bitcoin is still strong, has a real usecase, is decentralized for real and is easy to understand for most people. Try explaining Ethereum or Cardano to your dad, if adoption was the problem. 


When is your dad going to adopt Ethereum, beyond speculative interests? Is he ever going to use the platform itself and participate? He probably might not even be using Bitcoin at the moment. 




Bear in mind also, that it's valued at 60 billion dollar. That's not just a number, that's massive money mate. Huge ass companies, who really help the world, are not valued as highly. 



How does Crpytokitties and ICO scam allowance compare to the vision of Musk sending us the Mars in 2022? It fucking doesn't.

"&gt; Your bitcoins are never replaced by something.

What do you mean replaced? I said the bitcoins were locked up and you get a token representation of the value of the bitcoin within the channel. It's like buying poker chips the table... would you say the chips replaced your cash?


&gt; You have a shared bitcoin account with someone else with a signed ""exit transaction"" from this adress so both of you can use the agreed upon exit transaction whenever you want. This is a totally normal bitcoin transaction nothing else.

Obviously and that's not even a point of discussion. It's the LN tokens required to play poker and decide how those bitcoins are to be split up. 

&gt; Then if both of you agree to update this exit transaction to reflect either you or your friend to get more out of it you can do this ""under the table"".

Yes with tokens, vouchers, sea shells etc which are the value representing ones share of the btc locked in an LN channel. I could sell you my sea shell and tell you it has value because once the LN channel is closed you will get .1 btc. This way I don't need to wait around for the exit signing and you can profit of the patience or risk losing it all if never closes.

&gt; No token exists

Yes it does, otherwise nobody can transact and play poker and we can only get back our initial bitcoin. 

&gt; It's ONLY a totally normal bitcoin transaction that requires two signatures, it's NOTHING other. There is no token, you have misunderstood.

You're being ignorant. From the BTC explorer perspective you see 2 transaction however in our LN poker game 1000's of transactions occurred within an LN channel and it required some tokenized representation of the BTC we put in otherwise we can't play, this ""token/number/chip"" represent a value and I could play poker with it watching it go up and down or I could sell those to someone else. So its essentially these ""chips/numbers/paper voucher"" I'm selling are the LN-BTC token because it represents BTC in an LN channel that's redeemable for BTC once the exit has been signed.

&gt; You and me both sign a bitcointransaction where I get 1btc and you get 1btc.

Yes and how are you keeping a running count of your balance?! The answer is a ""tokenized"" representation of the value on a piece of a paper that is attributed to each user within your LN channel. 

&gt; There's nothing more to it, just totally normal bitcoin-transactions.

Then go back to the main blockchain and play poker on it, you obviously have no interest in LN and tokenizing your BTC because it's use case doesn't mean anything to you.",1525191135

"My honest opinion is that BTC is going down further. The initial drop from 9300 to 8870 resulted in a relatively strong bounce to 9050 on high volume on bitfinex, but we didn't see strong follow through (low volume) in the next few hours. 

My best guess as to how this plays out is that we'll go down to 8200-8500 before the price bounces and we start going up. Reason being this looks a lot like a full elliott wave playing out and we are currently on part C of the wave. Disclaimer, I'm no TA expert so take my opinion with a grain of salt.

"\&gt; Bitcoin Core thinks 1mb is the limit for block sizes?

You are showing either to be grossly ignorant or deliberately deceptive. 

The blocksize limit in bitcoin is already 4MB of weight or allowing  \~2MB  average Blocksizes if people choose to use that capacity. 1MB is  long  over and using that number is misleading at least. 

here is a detailed response to the challenges and concerns with scaling \-

"&gt;Another false narrative. There is no exclusive scaling solution. The first solution was a blocksize increase in fact(segwit) and many more onchain scaling solutions are being developed from MAST , Schnorr sigs, to a future HF

As a blocksize increase you have to admit it's done a terrible job. 8 months later and the blocks are how large? Did it do anything at all back in December other than remind people how out of touch and indifferent to user experience the Core devs are? 

MAST and Schnorr are cut from the same cloth as Segwit. Changes that the devs are pushing for irrespective of the users that actually require changes in user behaviour to be particularly useful. Is there a UX designer in all of Bitcoin Core? 

When do you project that future HF will happen?

&gt;The fact that people were willing to pay high fees 7 -8 months ago reflects how valuable bitcoin was. The fact that people aren't willing to pay much or even barely use BCC reflects how little people think of it.

Hahahah. I don't know what cryptocurrency will win in the long-run, but I know for a fact it won't be BTC. Most divided community with some of the earliest and most ardent Bitcoin fans now hating what Core has turned BTC into passionately, worst roadmap, most economically uninformed user-indifferent devs. 

Your idea that high fees didn't harm BTC because people still paid them is laughable. There's plenty of bad word of mouth going around about BTC because of the terrible user experience that represented for everyone involved.

I'd argue that Steem is one of the few blockchains that is actually improving lives due to its stated function, instead of speculation on its potential value.

I'm curious which blockchains you think are actually doing something for humanity.

"Introduction is referring to the current financial system, not bitcoin.

Here's Satoshi's quote:

*""Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe 
for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for 
double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or 
about 12KB per day. Only people trying to create new coins would need to run 
network nodes. At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the 
network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to 
specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would 
only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with 
that one node.*


*The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think. A typical transaction 
would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact). Each transaction has to be 
broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction. Visa processed 37 billion 
transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day. 
That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 
2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.*


*If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, 
sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.""*

"Lol you have the same problem as so many others and it's not that hard to understand. There are only any gains being made in one of the steps you mentioned. For any of those steps that happen over the course of 5/10/20/30 minutes while there can be a taxable event, the capital gains being collected is roughly equal to $0.00.

This is incredibly easy to understand and does in no way, shape, or form amount to being triple taxed on gains. You are only taxed on gains, and you are only likely to have significant gains from one of those transactions, which is most likely selling the IOTA back to BTC when you're trying to convert your gains to USD. Really simple stuff, and totally fair. Investors have been playing by these rules for decades now and there's no outrage or screams of unfairness.

&gt;Security is a spectrum. The more people we can get validating the rules the more secure bitcoin will be. This isn't the only security consideration but one among many. 

I actually agree with this to a degree. I just think its substantially more important for economically important actors like miners, exchanges, and businesses doing this, as their rejection of invalid chains is orders of magnitude more significant than the rejection of an invalid chain by some HODLer who never transacts because the fees are too high. I think a world where Bitcoin is allowed to grow onchain to world scale and a diverse set of businesses, miners, and the occasional hobbiest and large Bitcoin holder/user are validating the chain gets us more than enough security that the rules are being followed and there's serious and dramatic diminishing returns involved in the added ""security"" provided by the people who have been priced out by the larger blocks.

*What if an exchange uses custom software with the intent of being compatible with Bitcoin Core vXX and someone loses money because of some bug or lack of consistency?
*What if an exchange is using an older version of Bitcoin Core and someone loses money because of a lack of consistency found in a new version?

Do we reach a point where each exchange must list a specific product by referencing the GitHub project or version?  Or do they have to maintain their own public version of the code they are running?

If something similar to that happens, is Bitcoin.com legally correct in identifying their product with any name and ticker symbol they choose so long as they maintain a product definition as above?

With the level of understanding that the general public has today, what bitcoin.com is doing today to separately list Bitcoin Core (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is probably suitable differentiation.

&gt;unlike the shitfest created by 1MB with hi fees, huge delays, and Bitcoin businesses going out of business like falling flies. plenty of ppl are mad bro but keep living your fantasy.

And you're still holding on to BTC because...? You clearly don't know how to put your money where your mouth is. Must be scared that BCH isn't going to succeed (which, so far, it's really not. Down 80% from ATH, widely mocked, headed by known scammers, etc.)

"&gt; According to the whitepaper, Bitcoin is the chain that starts at the genesis block and contains the most work.

The whitepaper talks about the chain that has more work only on chains competing in the same network. I do not know if it is appropriate to apply the same criteria to chains of different networks of different coins. If only that criterion is used, it means that there is no way to counter a 51% attack. No fork that is made to have a functional network again could have the name Bitcoin because it would belong to the attackers.",1525188301

"It is exciting to see which vision of the project wins out, but unfortunately at this point, the daily usage of bch vs btc is around 10% in # of transactions per day according to the latest propaganda peice by roger ver. . So BCH has a very very long way to go. Volume today is also only around 10%, and it is interesting to note that I don't believe coinmarketcap counts bitmex in its volume equations, which has massive volume in the billions daily. 

It is quite the belief you formed about those who have been in crypto a long time. There are many even in the public eye who have been involved a long time that are not in the bch camp.

The same thing is going to happen in crypto. The second ""VEN"" gets a piece of the supply chain side of things, there won't just be 10 copycats, there will be HUNDREDS.

The second ENG or QSP establishes a foothold in sercurity verification, or TKY establishes identify verification, there will be HUNDREDS of ICOs all trying to do the exact same thing, in the same way, to get a piece of some niche corner of that market.

There may only be 100 of these 1500 coins that survive, but in 10 years, there will be half a million coins out there, all competing for 10-50 ""sectors"" of the market.

They way it currently works with bloom filters makes it possible for nodes to figure out what addresses belong to the same private keys.

&gt; No, for example fees payed to a payment service provider or transaction fees on exchanges are not going towards securing the network at all. It still works as an incentive to run a node.

The only fees paid on the bitcoin network go to miners. Miners secure the network. Fees dont go toward running SPV nodes in the protocol. Sure, miners *might* take on that extra expense for the network health, but as I said elsewhere, this is the prisoners dilemma: miners who dont serve SPV would save some expenses, while still benefiting from other miners serving SPV.

"Correct, if you accept the terminologies such as ""hard fork"", ""soft fork"", and ""contentious chain split"" created by the incumbent financed teams whose job it is to stop any single decentralized PoW cryptocurrency from gaining network effect, yes, neither chain is Bitcoin. 

BTC has hard forked away from the original Bitcoin years ago, so both are not ""Bitcoin"" if you adopt the lexicon of Bitcoin's enemies.

If you believe Bitcoin should be what is described in the white paper, and is the chain that adheres to the views of those who were excited to work on it in the early years, and don't believe that Bitcoin should become a settlement system (antithetical to peer to peer ecash), then Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin.

Seeing as Bitcoin Core has been captured by incumbents who have radically shifted it away from p2p ecash towards some sort of high fee settlement system to be used between large, wealthy incumbents, you are a real asshole if you give ""Bitcoin Core"" the monicker ""Bitcoin"".

Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin. Bitcoin Core is the remains of Bitcoin after incumbents financed its takeover and dismantled it.",1525187955

"**Autonomous car**

An autonomous car (also known as a driverless car, self-driving car, robotic car, auto) and an unmanned ground vehicle is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input.

Autonomous cars use a variety of techniques to detect their surroundings, such as radar, laser light, GPS, odometry and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage. Autonomous cars must have control systems that are capable of analyzing sensory data to distinguish between different cars on the road.

"That is an absurd mischaracterization of everything I've said. You're twisting my articulation of straight-forward, mathematical tautologies into some kind of political statement.

It's really quite simple.

1. There exists some total amount of measured SHA256d work capacity - which we can approximate by adding up the accumulated work proof of the blockchains built from it.

2. The SHA256d work capacity that has been expended in building the BTC chain is a subset of total existent SHA256d work capacity.

3. The SHA256d work capacity that has been expended in building the BCH chain is a subset of total existent SHA256d work capacity.

4. The subset (2) is of greater quanity than the subset (3).

So in this way, yes, _the work capacity supporting the BCH chain is a minority of the *total measured SHA256d work capacity*_. That in no way implies that anyone should be _forced_ to use or not use it, which is the implication of authoritarianism. Everyone is free to make whatever use they'd like of it. However, _the consensus qualities of a minority work capacity are strictly weaker than those of its majority counterpart_. 

This is a truism that has nothing to do with my opinion or any desire to control your actions. It is _a natural limit_ to what can be accomplished with a given resource. A majority work-capacity is capable of  maintaining a consistent blockchain, only so long as the majority of future work is expended toward the same end. The consistency of a blockchain built by a minority work-capacity cannot be ensured by that same minority.

"Because there are block efficiency solutions that should be implemented first, i.e. segwit and schnorr.

What is this horse in the race thing you keep saying? Yes, I own Bitcoin and dumped my BCH a long time ago. What does this have to do with the merits of each method. You're just full of logical fallacies aren't you? Do you *not* have a horse in the race?",1525187166
What I don't get is why is he pushing the so hard? He probably has a huge steak in Bitcoin as well. Unless he sold it to buy Bitcoin cash. It's beneficial for him to keep both of them high.

"If Chrome were the ONLY relevant browser, you absolutely would hear people referring to ""surfing Chrome"" instead of ""surfing the web"".

Why do you think searching the web is called ""googling""? Google is the only relevant search engine. Sure there's others, but nobody bings things. Nobody ducks things. People used to Yahoo things but not anymore. 

When you are the only tenant implementation of something you become the defacto standard. Bitcoin Core is no reception. ",1525187115
"Exactly. There is the point to consider where people feel BCH is being actively attacked by blockstream and something needs to be done by attacking back. I see this a lot with roger and how hard he’s pushing the naming convention change. I’m kind of torn on this whole subject. Like I get that BCH is following the original bitcoin vision moreso than BTC at this point, but if the majority of people still call BTC bitcoin it seems like that’s what consensus has decided is bitcoin currently? 

This can obviously change in the future, but IMO it gives a bad look to BCH if prominent community leaders are going against the general consensus to push their ideas as true. ",1525187107

"&gt;The blocksize limit in bitcoin is already 4MB of weight or allowing ~2MB average Blocksizes if people choose to use that capacity. 1MB is long over and using that number is misleading at least.

What's Segwit adoption at right now 33%? If you're going to be pendantic be better at being pedantic. You don't have anywhere near a 2 MB average blocksize limit.

&gt;I don't advocate and never have advocated everyone needs to run a full node. This is hyperbolic and dishonestly representing my position.  Is a ratio of 1 full node to 1000 SPV nodes an acceptable goal?

I don't know what you advocate; you didn't explain your entire ideology in a pithy response to me. I just want numbers, how you arrived at these numbers and why. Even at 1MB we already price out a lot of people from running full nodes. Why is that okay but it's not okay to lose some of BTC's nodes by going to larger blocks? Why does everyone in Bitcoin have to subsidize with very expensive transaction fees and a crippled economy the ability of a handful of hobbyists to run nodes more cheaply if they have bad computers and/or a bad internet connection? 

&gt;Is it fair to suggest that most people should have the option to run a full node if they want better security?

It already costs the block rewards from every confirmation an SPV wallet waits to defraud an SPV wallet. If you aren't transacting 100s of thousands of dollars you're already not worth defrauding. If you're transacting enough money that you would be worth it for a miner to defraud, and cannot simply wait sufficient confirmations, you can afford a full node at world scale. 

If you're transacting small sums and misinformed and overly paranoid then no I don't think everyone else should be subsidizing your paranoia by paying higher fees so that you can run a node you don't actually need.

&gt;Is a ratio of 1 full node to 1000 SPV nodes an acceptable goal?

I have no idea if a ratio of 1 full node to 1000 SPV nodes is an acceptable goal. Is there any rationale for those numbers or are they magic numbers?",1525186919
"So, btc max capacity at 1mb block is perfectly fine but 8mb blocks are disastrous for the network. 

It is also not possible to make any efficiency improvements in propagating blocks and validating transactions? And thus imposible to scale on\-chain? 

Do you really believe lightning can scale globally on 1mb blocks \(that are almost always full already\)? Don't you think it will become prohibitively expensive to open and close channels if bitcoin does not scale to 8mb blocks?  We've allready seen \&gt; $40 fees when btc became somewhat popular.

"For those of you who aren't fluent in Danish or are blocked by the pay wall, here's a small recap:

- Proshop is a Danish online retailer that sells computer equipment among other things.
- They expect to implement payment with Bitcoin and Ethereum by September this year.
- Rationale is increased certainty of payment for the company. In case of credit card fraud, the company foots the bill. If someone buys something with a stolen credit card, the rightful owner of the credit card will be reimbursed. The company doesn't have to reimburse if the customer pays with stolen crypto as the legislation is right now.
- A Danish organisation called Forbrugerrådet Tænk, an organisation whose purpose is to promote corporate social responsibility and consumer rights, advises them to be vigilant and responsive, as this is still a legal gray area in Denmark. There's no legislation specifically regarding Crypto at the moment, and the organisation is concerned about consumer rights when paying with Crypto. The organisation is still aware of the possibilities of Crypto, but stresses the importance of keeping traditional payment methods where the consumer has stronger rights. 
- As a little bonus, Dansk Erhverv - an organisation representing the interests of Danish companies - and IT-branchen - an organisation representing the interests of companies in the information technology sector - see a potential future for Crypto as a means of online payment.

"Exactly, you have something like 144 blocks to come forward with state 7, otherwise the settlement transaction for state 6 can be confirmed, which would then split the funds according to what we agreed upon.

So let's say at state 6 you and I had 5 and 1 bitcoin respectively. Now you transfer 1 bitcoin to me, and the new state 7 is 4 (you) and 2 (me).

You publish state 6, and I do nothing for a day. Now you can confirm the settlement, and you get 5 bitcoins, while I still get my 1 bitcoin.

If however I react to your old state being confirmed, then I publish update 7, which makes settlement 6 unconfirmable (it'd be a double-spend of the output from update 6). So we end up with settlement 7 which gives me my 2 bitcoins and you get your 4 bitcoins.",1525186339

Personally I could care less about the word bitcoin.  I'm only interested in the quality tool of a crypto to make free (as in freedom) and private transactions outside the federal reserve system.  Bitcoin use to be that, but the fees are an extremely crucial element of that in my opinion.  Paying anything more than a penny just to move it from your safe to a portable wallet or one hand to the other definitely affects its usability and ability to compete with standard fiat cash.

"&gt;Regardless of what the fees were cash is going to be cheaper, so how low would the fee have to go before you decided to start spending bitcoin visa instead of fiat?

As soon as the fees are similar to regular visa transactions with fiat and it's of similar convenience. It's not a big deal for me anyway so atm I'm not looking into using a 3rd party payment\-processor for Bitcoin\-to\-fiat payments.

&gt;That wouldn't explain why cards are gaining on cash for face to face transactions.  
&gt;  
&gt;If those things actually drove adoption then cash would be getting more popular, not less.  
&gt;  
&gt;Cards are beating out cash IRL because they're more convenient, not because they're cheaper or more private.

You're grossly misinterpreting what I'm saying. The replacement of cash due to convenience has already happened with the introduction of payment cards. Those still using cash use it because it in some way more convenient or cheaper for them, one would have to assume. When Bitcoin becomes more prominent, it will presumably replace cash for whatever use case it's still being used for today.",1525185947

&gt; There's plenty of people who can't or won't at 1MB. 

The blocksize limit in bitcoin is already 4MB of weight or allowing 2MB average Blocksizes if people choose to use that capacity. 1MB is long over and using that number is misleading at least.

&gt;\&gt; What's the optimal blocksize we need so we can support the worst  possible machines so that everyone who wants to truly can run a full  node.  

I don't advocate and never have advocated everyone needs to run a full node. This is hyperbolic and dishonestly representing my position. Is it fair to suggest that most people should have the option to run a full node if they want better security? Is a ratio of 1 full node to 1000 SPV nodes an acceptable goal?",1525185471

"A crucial component of the blockchain is missing. Take this part:

&gt; Only once a majority of nodes approve the snap and reach consensus can the snap be added to the snap-chain. If majority consensus is to reject the snap, it cannot be added to the snap-chain.

How does the majority ""reach consensus""? The problem of decentralized consensus is the critical problem that Bitcoin (and blockchain in general) solves.

If you have an isolated node that adheres to a different version of the protocol, then that node is quickly isolated since the updates it forwards are not transmitted by other nodes if it breaks the majority protocol. However, if there are 2 non-negligible sets of nodes and each set is well connected, you get into a situation where each set continuously tries to forward a chain that is invalid to the other set.

Furthermore, only relying on nodes to determine the valid state of the chain leaves you open to Sybil attacks.

Anyway, mining is a crucial component of the blockchain (at least in the way that Bitcoin uses it) and that's left out of the explanation, as you already remarked.

I don't think blockchain technology is very ELI5-compatible, as smart as some 5 year olds are. And that's OK. Not everything in the world can easily be dumbed down to a low enough level while still retaining accuracy and correctness. It's also not necessary for someone to know how a blockchain works, it's far more important that people know what the properties and advantages of a blockchain are.

Why, in a world of blocks that aren't full, where every transaction gets into the next block, would you expect a critical mass of miners to single out your transaction to not be included and potentially have to wait an extra block to be confirmed? Even in that unlikely scenario, your transaction is still getting confirmed and you can't take it back without tremendous cost.

You are also not relying on the ""good will"" of miners in any sense. They profit more based on every single transaction they include. Where is their incentive to randomly leave out a whole bunch of transactions so they make less money? 

And even if such a crazy thing were to happen, why would you expect all miners to avoid processing your *specific* transaction....block after block after block?

"  \&gt; what would be the harddrivespace  

Hard drive capacity is the least of our concerns due to –

Archival full nodes contain the full blockchain and allow new nodes to bootstrap from them . Current blockchain size is \~165\+GB for an archival node

Pruned nodes can get down to around \~**5GB** , and** have all the same security and privacy benefits of archival node**s but need to initially download the whole blockchain for full validation before deleting it \(It actually prunes as it validates\)

The primary resource concerns in order largest to smallest are:

1\) Block propagation latency \(causing centralization of mining\)

2\) UTXO bloat \(increases CPU and more RAM costs\)

3\) Bandwidth costs [https://iancoleman.github.io/blocksize/#\_](https://iancoleman.github.io/blocksize/#_)

4\) IBD \(Initial Block Download \) Boostrapping new node costs 

5\) Blockchain storage \(largely mitigated by pruning but some full archival nodes still need to exist in a decentralized manner\)

This means we need to scale conservatively and intelligently. We must scale with every means necessary. Onchain, decentralized payment channels , offchain private channels , optimizations like MAST and schnorr sig aggregation, and possibly sidechains/drivechains must be used.

Here is a study that reflects that continuous 8MB blocks would eliminate 95&amp;#37; of full nodes based upon ram alone.

I remember very clearly about when it was first announced publicly and then later on the article and other talk about the block limit came through.  Largely it was like Jessquit's post above, probably was shorter.  I remember there being a small amount of annoyance about it in the comments, since it depended on future changes to increase or get rid of it since if bitcoin succeeded it would definitely be a huge problem in the future.  But without it, a cranky kid or parties of the banks could have easily put the kibash on the project as soon as it started showing promise.

I had since got back into it for a short bit and made a few hundred dollars and got back out in 2013.   And then got back into it last summer.

You can imagine my confusion about all the block limit talk.  First couple months I assumed everyone must be talking about some other block limit than the one I was aware of.

"It's actually mind boggling. The crypto market is intensively inefficient it makes any economic theory useless.

However where there is efficiencies there is opportunities. 

The fact that so many ERC-20 tokens are worth far more than Skycoin is a great example of this incredible mis-pricing by the market. 

People seem to have completely lost sight of the MASSIVE differences between a token and a platform. 

I get that Synth may come off as rash to many people at first but just look past that for a second and look at the tech, look at github and look at the long history of Skycoin. 

Skycoin is a platform, not just merely an ERC-20 token that only changed a few lines of code, raise money and think about development after they have raised the money. They are so far ahead in blockchain development compared to all these tokens that were launched in 2017/2018 it's not even funny. They have been developing for 6-7 years now. 

In terms of tech there is no way the prices are being valued accurately no matter what metric you use.

BCH and BTC are both *technically* bitcoin.  BCH follows the scaling plan of the [Bitcoin whitepaper](http://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdfhttp://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf), and BTC follows a scaling plan that was later introduced by a company called Blockstream (circa 2014-2017).

The reason that BTC inherited the majority of the network effect is because its scaling changes were introduced into the code in a way that bypasses the ""voting"" mechanism described in the bitcoin whitepaper.  The BTC code was essentially rewritten, but it kept the same branding and ticker symbol (and thus why it kept the network effect).  About a month before the code rewrite took effect, a developer named Amaury Sachet decided to preserve the original bitcoin code by means of a software fork.  This is why BCH is the original bitcoin, despite not having inherited the ticker symbol or network effect.

The way that the BTC code rewrite was pulled off is a truth stranger than fiction.  It involves a curiously large amount of funding from banking and insurance consortia, a highly successful censorship campaign, and Blockstream/Core developers reneging on two separate agreements.  If you're interested in learning more, the issue has been diligently documented over the past 4 years.  I can point you to some links, if needed.",1525183813

To be clear, I am not saying that any one coin is better than any other. Not only is 'better' subjective, it's too easy for people to argue about it all day.

What if it didn't even have its inherent flaws like an ""emergency"" difficulty adjustment? The ""better"" technology doesn't always win. Laserdisc wasn't better or worse than DVD. DVD won. Shoelaces aren't inherently better than Velcro or snaps or buttons - shoelaces won. Hemp is better by almost every metric than wood, oil and concrete... and look at how that worked out so far!

Straight up, BCH's only argument is that BTC is crap and since everyone knows that's a lie, well, you can see how that's a bit of a problem for BCH. Frankly I couldn't care less how BCH does. I think that as people get more educated they'll all come to the same conclusion.

"BCH was born from what's known as a contentious hard-fork, which is where a proposed change doesn't reach consensus but is rolled out anyway. The difference between a contentious hard-fork and a contentious soft-fork (like SegWit) is that a contentious hard-fork forces a chain-split to occur.

The devs behind Bitcoin ABC (the client that initiated the BCH fork) didn't want to cause too much havoc by having two coins named BTC (one with 8MB blocksize limit, the other with 1MB) competing for dominance, so they implemented replay protection and called the new chain Bitcoin Cash.

As the fork did not have consensus, the majority of the hashpower did not upgrade and so continued mining BTC. This is why it's generally accepted that BCH split *away from* BTC, rather than the other with around.

The argument that BCH is Bitcoin comes from the fact that shortly after the BCH fork, BTC implemented a series of contentious soft-forks which sent it in a vastly different trajectory than it had been on, and so many argue that it is further removed from the original bitcoin because of this.

With that said though, because the contentious changes were pushed as soft-forks they did not need consensus to avoid a chain split. And so the network is by some definition the original chain, even though it's actually changed more than BCH in terms of user experience, projected outcome, and philosophy.

This is why BCH is considered young. BCH is working towards emergent consensus (you agree when you see it works), rather than traditional Nakamoto consensus (you agree before anything is set in stone).",1525182991

Exactly. Bitcoin Cash is both a store of value *and* a payment system and both can't be separated. Something to be a good store of value must have intrinsic utility that will garantee there will always be demand for it. The only intrinsic utility for cryptos is being a good payment system with unique properties. BTC destroyed that so therefore they destroyed the garantee that there will always be demand for it which turned it as a bad and risky long term store of value.,1525182549

This is a brand new record for the BitShares blockchain.

This is in comparison to some of the other way more popular blockchains. For example, during the same 24 hour period, Bitcoin processed 220,191 transactions (TRXs) and Ethereum processed 780,618 TRXs.

An extremely important factor to keep in mind is the capacity of an individual blockchain.

Yesterday, the TRXs that were processed on the Bitcoin blockchain took up 46.34% of the total TRX capacity while Ethereum TRXs took up 100% of the blockchain capacity plus an additional 28,477 unconfirmed TRXs

Even though BitShares set a new ATH (all-time-high) record, it did so by only using .13% of its total network capacity. That's less than 1% of the total capacity which means BitShares is fully capable of scaling to amazing levels without breaking a sweat.

You just cannot time the market. Yesterday I wanted to sell, I didn't, market rebounded instantly. Today I didn't want to sell, thinking it will play out like yesterday. And market just dipped hard. No one knows what will happen. Absolutely no one. ",1525180798

This demonstrates a clear preference that if you have both dollars and bitcoin you will get rid of the dollars before the bitcoin. ""converting"" USD means spending them to buy bitcoin, and why would someone possibly accepted USD in exchange for bitcoin if your expressed preference of ""always spend bitcoin before fiat"" was a universal one?

If both Bitcoin and USD were equally accepted, why would you spend USD to buy Bitcoin to then spend on goods and services (wasting more time and fees), instead of just directly spending USD?

This is the dynamic that keeps people ""HODLing"" bitcoin and spending USD despite HODLers professed preference for spending bitcoin.

Apart from a few maniacs wasting money on ""spend and replace"", most people are sensible enough to realize if you have both USD and BTC, instead of spending BTC and then buying it back with USD and incurring greater fees and inconvenience, you can just keep hold of BTC and spend USD and save more money.

I don't know how anyone can argue that a currency who's motto is ""HODL"" is or will be used just as much as a currency that people only use because its useful for trading, not because they believe keeping hold of it will make them rich.

"&gt;... Right now yes. You expect them to continue to do that when serving millions os spv users will start to cost considerable amounts in hardware and bandwidth? Its not like it doesnt require additional resources to serve spv users.

If miners stop serving spv users at large scales then they're jeopardizing their own investment since Bitcoin price correlates with on-chain usage and a prerequisite for using Bitcoin is being able to validate your own transactions. So they're incentivized by their own long-term horizon to continue providing SPV wallet services to users. If we lost the army of volunteer relay nodes this would actually help the network as there would no longer be a layer of unaccountable volunteer potential Sybils. Moreover, there's various optimizations an actual business could leverage to keep their costs in check when they provide data to SPV wallets too. Like leveraging CDNs, pruning historical data and/or storing it using archival services like Glacier, leveraging technologies like compact blocks/xthin/Graphene. There's tons of room for optimizations to bring the miners costs down. If you need further help to see this, just redirect all the mental energy you're used to directing towards handwaving any of LNs severe issues and direct it towards handwaving any problems you see with large blocks.",1525178549

A blocksize to prevent spam makes no sense. Would an even smaller blocksize prevent spam? Think of all the spam prevention a 3kb blocksize would prevent.

Bitcoin (btc) was overrun with transactions because of adoption. As people fled to better alternatives the congestion was relieved. Bitcoin (bch) as it gets more adoption will have more transaction. 

Mind you there are folks like theymos and gmax that don't understand Bitcoin. They think that any transaction that can't pay hundreds of dollars for a fee is spam. They think that any transaction that isn't optimized using their preferred methods is spam.

"Except crypto is a bubble. It's the literal definition of one. The most well known bubble in history was the dot com bubble. According to wikipedia:

[The dot-com bubble (also known as the dot-com boom, the dot-com crash, the Y2K crash, the Y2K bubble, the tech bubble, the Internet bubble, the dot-com collapse, and the information technology bubble) was a historic economic bubble and **period of excessive speculation** that occurred roughly from 1997 to 2001, a period of extreme growth in the usage and adaptation of the Internet.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble)

A bubble is an excessive over speculation of value, when the bubble pops, there is a correction. The entire history of crypto valuation thus far has been bubbles forming and popping over and over. I am not saying crypto is invalid or worthless. I am saying the price market is in fact a bubble in the current market. We are starting to see some stabilization after the last bubble in December currently. I see ""Crypto isn't a bubble!!"" parroted over and over in this sub. But i feel if you are going to invest in it, it's important to understand it is in fact a bubble and nearly all the coins are currently over valued.

Also that stock prices reflects ‘future value’ instead of current value, which I’m pretty sure is nonsense (or at least unorthodox economics-wise, AFAIK).

You say you don't care but you do. You care so much so that you say to others that don't believe in PoW being the only way a true crypto can run to GTFO they don't know if they don't agree with your little world and opnion. 

You either run mining hardware, or got in early on BTC/other PoW coins and want investors to invest in your coin/coins instead, or you simply don't understand or been around tech enough to see how each year will bring new updates to blockchain itself, new algos will come, you do realise what quantum computers can do right? and that PoW stands no chance against them? forget your asics. All a way to fund Bitmain \- another story another time, there a reason why BTC stopped the asic exploit and BCH was majorly supported by Bitmain. 

I will tell you something to help you rest a bit, I believe BTC started this revolution, was the first, well almost considering ripple/opencoin was almost there as well same time. Just for the tech side of it and my attachment to it, even though I liquidated majority of my BTCs, I will always keep one even if goes to zero, and will put in paper if no pools/nodes exist going forward, laughable to you \- plausible to me. Think on this. 

\- Clearly I didn't, I am sorry but I don't see the co\-relation that you are implying so I didn't. No need for name calling. I take your point that you see it as First Virtual \- I don't. Ripple is not Paypal or doing anything of the likes. Your existing systems will stay in place, you will use your normal visa, your normal banking products, even paypal can be powered by ILP and Ripple is just what works as a protocol layer where XRP if used is the fastest, if used is what Ripple needs to prove to you and me both. 

1\) your opinion, nothing to say.

2\) You don't see anything, anything beyond your world and I see that yes. All claims false. First of all it is using a proper cryptographic signature\(BTW its not a protocol that secures it, its the signature\) but you would only know that if you were actually technical, your arguments point else\-wise. It is 100&amp;#37; by definition a crypto. XRP is open source but, that is again a fact, why is so hard to swallow? There is a blockchain and XRP itself has numerous third\-parties and banks running its validator nodes, which makes it decentralised in the true sense, initially it wasnt but it's getting better and 2018 decentralisation is all Ripple is focusing on as a priority. I won't even go further in this debate because even BTC/BCH or others are majority hash owned by one pool. XRP is a proper crypto try as hard as you like but bring real arguments rather calling others dumb \- you are coming out real dumb else\-wise. PoW requires work to be done before assets are given true, but thats just that algo \- PoS or others to come will still be using all crypto signatures and be a crypto token/coin and assets will be pre\-mined. To you maybe PoW is the end of the world. Sadly tech doesn't take stagnant this way.

3\) It is a form of PoS 100&amp;#37;. Validators do the validation for transactions, PoS works different to PoW but underlying concept is the same, run through transactions. There is a reason why PoS like XRP destroys anything PoW out there right now, literally destroys it and quantum computers coming will only make it faster, not completely destroy it. Real world does not want to wait 1 hour to pay for their coffee, transactions also need to go beyond current VISA network and most importantly people in my opinon want to continue using the fastest simplest service, even if its their credit card. But if that bank is using XVia, XRP will be the working horse behind the scenes, and investors will be selling to these products on public exchanges, something people like you will miss out on falling in this PoW vs PoS debate not looking at the actual world preference out there. 

Incentive is what is perceived incentive to the company/individual running the node/validator \- not what you think. Go read my old commend again on why people/companies are joining up to run XRP validators including MIT university, got this? they don't run BTC or other coin nodes. Most importantly what's the incentive or running a full BTC node? the same applies to XRP. So useless argument.

4\) 100&amp;#37; agreed. Not sure if all the time, but many a times he has been very shady.

5\) I am wasting my time on you. Really? So a bank is not third party to Ripple lol? How is BTC or others more decentralised when one pool we both know owns majority hash? It is decentralised now, getting more decentralised and within this year will be the most decentralised crypto out there. Like it or not, keep crying it is not \- let the university and academia and actual programmers/architects tell the world how it really is. Not what you think. 

Stop spreading FUD, Ripple cannot freeze anyones assets. Google it up, 1000s of times this has been discussed, but yes the exchanges can using the ledger and it is a great concept to stop fraud and other illegal activities, and to enforce contracts, like JED trying to Dump in December highs. Got it? they stopped a dump by showing exchange the contract and asking them to enforce a freeze if exchange agreed? do you comprehend? 

6\) Thanks, clearly I shouldnt have used that link \- I just didnt have much time. There are many articles that will claim it's not, many will claim it is. 

7\) This is getting pointless on you, but if you are truly willing to learn start studying academic papers and research on XRP ledger and ripple. I mean you are the guy that doesn't even understand the difference between protocol and a crypto signature \- but i hope you take time and learn. 

Here is a complete in\-depth analysis of the XRP ledger, its decentralisation, its robustness, expertise in its design, the algos used, cryto signatures, everything you claim IT IS NOT, IT SADLY IS. so read please and come back with how your opinion is better than academia and they know nothing and if you have good points, I will give you my expertise and qualifications, drop yours and lets talk more.

"&gt; I think people mostly don't spend Bitcoin yet because not a lot of merchants are accepting it, fees are high etc

Fees are lower than they have been in years. 

&gt; If I hold $10k and 1btc, it won't matter to me what currency I use to buy a $10k car, as long as I can easily convert between the two after the fact. I'd probably use USD simply because most people won't accept Bitcoin.

If both dollars and bitcoin where equally accepted, why wouldn't you want to spend the one that will go down in value over time rather than the one that will go up?

The convertibility doesn't change the fact if you have both USD and BTC its better to spend USD and save BTC than spend BTC and save USD. When you convert USD to BTC, they don't disappear, someone else just has the USD, and if everyone follows the pattern of using USD to buy things and keeping hold of BTC with a plan of waiting for years before using it, then naturally very few people will be spending BTC so very few retailers will have an incentive to try and accept it.

This is what stops deflationary currencies every becoming popular. It's the reason Aristophanes wrote 2000 years ago that everyone hoards gold and silver coins while using brass coins for trade.

It's the misconception that somehow saving value and trade tokens are the same thing and will be treated at such, which leads to all kinds of strange rationalizations for why people ""HODL"" something that is obviously better to HODL than to use as trade tokens. see: spend and replace madness",1525177199

Do bear in mind market capitalization is a meaningless figure in crypto. I could create my very own ShitCoin with a total supply of 100bn and then sell 1 coin for 5$ AND BAMN! ShitCoin just became a $500bn market cap coin which is more expensive than FaceBook ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

"&gt; The way Bitcoin core has departed from Satoshis original vision to a hobby project is a bit sad.

OK. It's usually pointless to try to guess how Satoshi would feel about things happening today. Nobody knows. But that much is certain that Bitcoin was supposed to be community driven experiment. That's exactly like Satoshi intended. If you disagree I can't really take you seriously.

&gt; Bitcoin scale perfectly well if you don't mix in the tragedy of the raspberry pi nodes that adds no quality to the network.

More nodes -&gt; more decentralization. There is no harm in that.

Even with 1MB block size limit the blochain grows rapidly if blocks are full. The rasperry pi won't be enough at some point regardless. What we must ensure however that the blockchain never grows so fast that decentralization is threatened. Nodes must be able to be run on normal computers over TOR. Only then we can be sure that it stays ungovernable.

We can't predict the future. It may very well be possible that we see in year 2035 that the block size limit could have been 4Mb or even 8Mb all along. That is possible! However that's not how Bitcoin should be developed. That's way too big of a risk to take when talking about the future of money!

&gt; f you don't have any utility of running a node you should run one in the first place, it's just bad praxis and add waist to the system.

Not sure what you are trying to say here. Of course ordinary users shouldn't run fully validating nodes. Everything should be made as easy as possible for them. That will happen in time. However everyone (at least almost eveyone) should be able to run a node if they wished to do so.

&gt; If you want a high quality decentralized network we should focus on adding more users to the network so that businesses can grow and the numbers of quality nodes will grow as well.

Sure at some point. But as I said earlier, Bitcoin isn't ready for mass adoption. And nodes being run solely by Big businesses is also very worrying scenario.

&gt; We don't want to make another hobby project of Bitcoin cash

No, you wan't to make new FIAT which is just not as good as FIAT in anything. I get it.

"I used a shorthand argument, without spelling out every word, because I was assuming you had a decent grasp of the conversation. If you want me to be uber verbose, in order to show I am not strawmanning you; very well, here goes.

What you were saying is (paraphrased): Blockstream has published a proposed improvement to LN, which means they want to replace LN, which proves they think LN is half-baked.

What I am saying is: this chain of logic does not hold; replacing one part of a system does not replace the entire system, LN is still LN if it uses this new ""eltoo"" payment channel setup instead of the old one, and just because an improvement is made to a system does not mean it was half-baked before. I tried to show this by applying the same chain of logic to Bitcoin.

Bitcoin also receives protocol changes, replacing one part of the functionality with something else. Let's take as an example BIP152 aka compact blocks. According to the logic you seem to have implicitly applied to the situation with eltoo and LN, the introduction of compact blocks for more efficient block relay would have replaced Bitcoin, and it would have proven that Matt Corallo thought Bitcoin was half-baked.",1525176879

It’s because BTC still has the network effect that was created by the original success of bitcoin. This is an effect that was building up long before core developers/blockstream socially engineered controversial and unnecessary changes to the scaling plan.

Network effect is incredibly strong, but it won’t last forever. A growing number of people are starting to see that the fundamental properties of BTC have been dismantled and replaced by a framework that looks like a less efficient version of the legacy banking system.

In any event, as crypto adoption incresases  to the point where people begin using it every day, the markets will decide which currency offers them the better value proposition: one with almost no fees and instant transactions that can be used via (non-SMS) text message and has tons of apps built around it, or; the one with extremely high fees, a convoluted 3rd-party routing system that few can access and will always be “ready soon” (LN has been using that line since 2015).

Spam is when what you’re sending is unwanted data that is stressing a network, with the intention to profit off the network’s susceptibility to such attacks.

Satoshi dice and every similar application of Bitcoin did no such thing.

What they did is flood the network with legitimate usage; their use-cases call for specific types of transactions, but it’s no one’s right to point at their type of transaction and call it spam.

Blockstream started the whole bullshit campaign demonizing utility (calling it spam), simply because their network is purposely throttled down to a 1mb pipeline, meaning any legitimate high-throughout utility such as satoshi dice will flood the fuck out of the BTC network. 

Hence why BTC is broken and is not reliable enough even as a settlement layer for lightning.

I believe that once BTC is around the 9.8 to 9.9K mark, two scenarios will unfold:  (a) BTC dips (in which case, you can use your BTC to buy back the alts at a cheaper price or (b) BTC goes on a run.  I believe that BTC will not limp cross the 10K mark this time around.  And this run will lead to BTC/LTC rise and a temporary alt bleeding.  So if it goes up to 10.5 to 10.8K, you can again buy the alts at a cheap price.

No... It's a fucking datastructure.  Bitcoin offers the risks/rewards he's talking about.

Bitcoin has many backups.  The key point is that it's blockchain is immutable. 

He touched on the fact that financial privacy was TAKEN not given.  I'd argue that Bitcoin isn't really a tool (yet) for easy financial privacy, but if we're ever going to get there first we need a financial system beyond the control of banks and governments. 

This guy ignores the fact that transactions in the central banking system almost always can be reversed.  Once a transaction is in a block it's got a very high degree of certainty of being there forever.  Each block added upon it cements the transfer of value. 

Not to mention the government can't seize your Bitcoin if you secure it properly. 

I just love how he mentions that gold was what the private bank notes represented with private currency.  So far doesn't mention we went to a system where the dollar is now the store of value and we separated from gold. 

This fucking interviewer's twitch whenever she says Blockchain instead of Bitcoin is infuriating. 

He kind of misses the point that Bitcoin is its own store of value and that the Bitcoin protocol is the entity that is more trust worthy than Government. 

I agree that people shouldn't be going into debt to buy Bitcoin.  

Not familiar with his history of money, but it does seem to be a nice story.

Gold isn't easily divisible.  Bitcoin is.  The way you divide gold is with IOUs and fractional reserve banking.

I love how this guy talks about occupy and then supports the system that has become extraordinarily efficient at centralizing wealth among the few. 

How does nature help us with freedom.  That shit makes no fucking sense. 

The idea behind Bitcoin is that the people are now in charge of the monetary system.  If Banks fuck up the government doesn't get to decide to bail them out.  

He doesn't understand the technical limitations of why other crypto currencies cannot compete with Bitcoin realistically long term.  Ethereum is a dead project as far as I am concerned.  Casper is vaperware and they already have ASICs.  A Turing complete centrally controlled coin seems stupid.  Bcash lol ... 99.99 % of crypto currencies out there have no long term viability.

"I don’t think Bitcoin or Ethereum are more decentralized than EOS. Block Producers are similar to Mining Pools. You can’t mine solo, you must join one of the Mining Pools, they compete with each other to generate blocks, verify transactions. Theoretically, 1 mining pool can censor your transactions or refuse to include your transactions in their mining blocks because of low fees.",1525174018
"&gt;I don't understand how Bitcoin having 90% of the mining power spread into 16 entities is different from EOS having 100% of its block production spread to 21 entities.

Because in the former case this is a description of the current situation but easily able to change if more people/entities mine while in the latter case the bug has become a feature and it is written into the system that the limitation will be there forever.  I'm not saying that limited decentralisation is a bad thing but there is a real difference between the two situations.",1525174017
An important point OP doesn't mention is that the lopsidedness for BTC and ETH isn't baked in to the system.  It may be the case that large amounts of mining power are controlled by a few entities but it need not remain that way and any other miners can always join in and dilute that control.

Bitcoin in a way is being “injected” with new coins every day up until that 21 millionth coin is mined.

"I'll admit I probably classify as biased because I have EOS. I agree there is some hype stemming from the runaway price recently, but I have some disagreements.

* 17bn market cap is a negative? The price ran away from everyone recently, this is something that I'd argue that 90% of the people on this subreddit are eagerly awaiting their token to do. When it happens to you, you celebrate, if somebody else why is it reason enough to complain?
*17bn cap is not even a reflection of the value of all the tokens, it's the latest trade times the circulating supply, if all tokens went on the market at once what would they trade at? It's obvious that it isn't worth its market cap and neither is any other coin/token.
* Assumption that EOS can be censored based upon a long chain of hypotheticals. He's basically making 5 nested if statements to come to the conclusion that EOS can be censored, but you could throw up any 5 assumptions to make anything true in the same way. If Kevin bacon was transformed into an egg.... And I ate an egg for breakfast.... Then it's possible I ate Kevin Bacon for breakfast. And it's possible to censor EOS too? 
* Block producers are incentivised to collude so they can price fix bribes to voters? The community hasn't even come to accept block producers who offer bribes. The closest thing you have to a BP offering bribes is EOSdac, which a lot of people are against.
*The inflation isn't necessarily even 5%, its configurable and a huge chunk of it doesn't even go to BP's.

&gt; This idea of ‘zero user-fees’ is disingenuous because it suggests that economic incentives are no longer required to maintain the network.

huh, just making up conclusions here. Maybe it just means what it says? Maybe 'There are no fees' means there are no fees... He goes to say that the inflation is a fee. Inflation is inflation. A fee is something you pay for a service. You would pay no fees on EOS. This is a really weird illogical leap.

&gt;EOS does indeed have fees, but they are hidden in the form of inflation.

Ughh do you even know what a fee is? What he said is just as nonsensical as 

&gt;EOS does indeed have free bags of cocaine, but they are hidden in the form of inflation.

Listen, people don't want to pay a couple of pennies every time they do something on their computer. You see how people freak out about micro transactions in their vidya games so the alternative to make dapps free to interact with is a good one. You can write a dapp, stake your tokens to run it, and when you decommission the dapp you get all your tokens back, meanwhile every user of your dapp didn't even know they were interacting with a blockchain behind the interface. Nobody was charged a penny. And if the price of the token rose while you had your tokens staked running your dapp guess what you just made a profit on top.

&gt;It is hard to justify EOS’ long term valuation when it relies on a 5% inflation rate to subsidize BPs.

But it doesn't, there are so many more variables than just the inflation rate which isn't even fixed.


&gt;Even if these assertions are false, I find it hard to justify such a protracted fundraiser, which overtly screams of greed. It does not cost $2bn+ to launch a blockchain. For context, Bitcoin never raised money and Ethereum raised $18m.

1. It's not a fundraiser, the EOS.IO software being made by block.one has independent funding.
2. The year crowd-sale demonstrably makes it harder for whales to steal up all the tokens. If you contributed a disproportionately larger sum of ETH to the contract your returns would shrink the more you put in. Large buyers can only sprinkle a little every day to barely get the token at market price anyway. 
3. The money goes toward dapp producers, you can be granted funding from the crowd-sale to produce dapps.

&gt;Another point of concern is that the $EOS tokens explicitly do not give the token holder any right to access once the EOS chain has been launched.

Correct.

&gt;The expectation is that BPs will honour token distribution but there are groups of prospective BPs that have said that they will instead distribute EOS native assets in an equitable manner through an airdrop.

I think this quote might represent a genuine misunderstanding on the authors part. I think I know kind of what he's alluding to but I won't speculate.

Ultimately I think this post represents a little bit of chagrin at the missed opportunity for their investment. The author probably wishes that all of the hype for EOS was instead focused toward their token, and that they are financially being disadvantaged by new money being funnelled into a new project that they aren't invested in. The author obviously believes in ETH and is really knowledgeable on it. He probably knows a lot of great news about his favoured project, and wonders why the attention, money, and profits are being diverted elsewhere. ",1525173291

"&gt;Interesting. So why did Satoshi choose to reduce the block size instead of increase it to combat spam? 

This is a common misunderstanding.

There are two different attacks under discussion.

The first is a ""poison block"" attack. This is the attack the block size limit was created to prevent. At the time it was created the level of ""spam"" on the network was zero, and the coin had no real established market value, very few miners, and extremely low mining difficulty. It cost almost nothing at all to mine at home. A malicious miner could generate a giant block full of transactions to himself, and basically cause all the other miners to choke on it while trying to validate it. This attack is described [here](http://gavinandresen.ninja/One-Dollar-Lulz).  The limit was set at 1MB which was two orders of magnitude larger than the largest topical block - ie, *extremely* high with respect to the network demand, with [the expectation that it could be easily raised long before it was an impediment](http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/bitcointalk/485/). Having a block size limit was a way to keep anyone from making a poison block without getting automatically orphaned.

""Spam"" is a different thing altogether. Spam is when someone creates a large number of low fee transactions with the purpose of ""padding"" the real transactions with fake ones to *fill the block size to the limit.* Maybe miners do it in order to jack up fees. Maybe altcoin pumpers do it to degrade performance of the Bitcoin chain. Maybe there's some other perfectly benign reason for these transactions.  Maybe they're just a user trying to make a lot of inexpensive transactions. Whatever the reason, the point to understand is that in a spam attack, *the block size limit itself is the attack vector.*",1525172538

"A few things.

Of course Bitcoin did not crowdfund but many of the projects you mentioned that did not crowdfund actually did, oops. 

Also tokens are records on a chain. They exist within a larger ecosystem. A key is still required to alter the record. Therefore the smart contract is based around the modification of that record.

The token proves through consensus that what ever utility it tells us it provides actually happens. It is therefore trustless.

If you cannot determine this by doing your due diligence and researching the token, and how it utilities smart contracts or allows the function of dapps then it's either a shitcoin or your an idiot.

If similar happens with EOS block producers, you can vote against them, but unless a large number change their vote at the same time, nothing happens - and the vote changers could lose financial benefits if the block producers are offering rewards for votes.

"Because market capital is not the same as valuation, not to mention market capital is fundamentally different in crypto compared to companies. With companies, all of the trading is done on USD base pairs. In cryptocurrency, the vast majority of the trading and purchases are done in Bitcoin. This means that the value is mostly coming from the value of Bitcoin.

To be clear, there is no dollar value on most cryptocurrencies because most cryptocurrencies are not traded for dollars, they are traded for Bitcoins and the price you see in dollars is the price of the currency in Bitcoin converted to dollars.

Thus the ""market capital"" of all coins goes up and down when the dollar price of Bitcoin goes up and down because the calculation of the dollar price is based on the price of Bitcoin. This means that most of the cryptocurrencies are propped up by Bitcoin and the market capital of the majority of the cryptocurrency sphere is propped up by Bitcoin and can essentially be created from nothing.

This is slowly changing as more and more exchanges are discussing adding full fiat pairs, like Binance and Bittrex. Once this happens, many coins will likely lose some value and not be part of Bitcoin's pumps anymore, because they will be traded against dollars instead of Bitcoin and the price will not be calculated in Bitcoin but in dollars. So any raise in Bitcoin value won't change the price.",1525169298

"You should point out all the investment categories.  1. Coin - these should be split into trackable - BTC, BCH, LTC, etc. Semi privacy (can still be tracked but with more difficulty or privacy is an option) XVG, PiVX etc and full privacy (very difficult to track) XZC, ZEC, DASH, XMR  etc.

Then come the protocol coins.  This is where you are investing in a protocol that issues tokens - there is some confusion about these coins because the ability to issue smart contracts can also be done on any of the cash coins too.  Only it's not as streamlined as it is in something like NEO - these are ETH, ETC, NEO, EOS, ARDR etc. You could put XLM and ARK into here too as both function as cash coins and protocols.

Next come the tokens.  Which are, almost as you say, Kickstarters.  However, Kickstarter projects often don't reward you with any part ownership of that company if it is a success.  With tokens you are essentially buying part ownership of the company.  Some great tokens are OMG, POWR, EVEREX, and many others.

There are coins that fall outside of these specific areas and extreme caution should be used when investing.  Take VEN as a good example.  They have no white paper and the VEN token is just one branch of the overall organisation.  Many people think the VEN coin is part of that company's goods tracking and anti piracy scheme, but it isn't.  That part of the VEN organisation is wholly owned by VEN organisation, it is for profit and none of the profits are fed into the VEN token.  Quite what the VEN token is actually for is shrouded in a fog.  It could be a great coin, but it isn't tied to any of VENs profit making schemes.  So, I would treat it with kid gloves and be wary of investing until a full white paper is released, and the mystery as to its true purpose is revealed.

VEN is the highest profile token of this nature.  However, there are plenty of others that have vague use cases and no white paper.

If you are investing in projects, you must ensure accuracy white paper and a proper road map exist.  If they don't exist then you have no idea where your investment is going.",1525166101

"&gt;this is a complete non-sequitur appeal to authority.
No it isn't. It's important to acknowledge that (1) the protocol was designed to fulfil a certain purpose (trustless peer-to-peer electronic cash) and the white paper claimed to have developed the means for doing so, and (2) the arbitrary limit on BTC block space—which is somehow perfectly right for preserving hobbyist full nodes—originated for another purpose entirely. 

&gt;Not *unmistakable*
Show me anything suggesting otherwise.

&gt;Full nodes enforce network rules […] What's your point?
Enforce rules for whom? My point is that miners couldn't give two shits if your consensus rules conflict with majority hash power. Network security *depends* on hashing power—one cpu one vote, not one node one vote. You know this. The network is designed to ensure that non-mining nodes cannot affect consensus.

&gt;That's not true, SPV only validates the given transaction against the block header, it doesn't validate that signature data is valid through relevant blocks.
Please elaborate. I'm unclear how SPV node verification is any less secure for sufficiently old transactions. 

&gt;you didn't even address miner centralization.
Please explain how miner centralisation is increased by larger blocks more so than by asics and high fees tx fees.

&gt;That doesn't mean much and doesn't stop hostile actors from involving themselves.
If hostile actors can gain more than 50% hashing power and are willing to burn a whole heap of money destroying the network, then there is nothing your full node can do to stop them. The richest 100 people could probably destroy capitalism if they wanted to, but they won't because it is irrational and that makes collusion improbable. 

&gt; this is a terrible argument. […] Okay, you're entire argument is based around numerous logical fallacies. […] Your argument is merit-less
The ""terrible argument"" here is you throwing around empty words. I've explained why non-mining full nodes don't contribute to consensus (which is the only thing that matters when it comes to 'decentralisation') and you've done little to refute it. You could have, for example, said more about how and why you think full nodes ""enforce"" consensus. Or about the ostensible security issues you see with SPV node verification, but you didn't. Try harder. ",1525165142

That said what the writer of your posted article there is trying to explain is the differences that lawmakers and regulators will use to differentiate legal asset classifications. The reason for the many different subsets is an attempt to make clear that these coins, tokens etc are not marked as securities by lawmakers as that would put them in a very different realm of regulation. For the average user these classifications(made in your posted medium article) are not necessary can be helpful to see how lawmakers may view them. Crypto projects have tried very hard to make sure their coins/tokens do not fall under the stringent regulation that accompanies securities which is how all these subsets arose. Bottom line that article is meant to be a reference to what proposed regulations will appear as for different cryptos though many are not there yet and those classifications are bit premature and unneeded at this point IMO. Really just being aware of the difference between tokens and coins outlined in OPs post should suffice as regulation of asset classes are, at this point, a bit premature. I hope that helped",1525162826

"&gt; On a quick side note, do you really think that someone as obviously brilliant as Satoshi would have released Bitcoin as is and claimed it to be ""electronic cash"", if he thought it could only handle 4 to 7 tps? 

The definition of ""p2p electronic cash"" is certainly up for debate and either way this is a complete non-sequitur appeal to authority.

&gt;The evidence is unmistakable that Satoshi always assumed block size would grow organically with demand for block space, and that the block size cap was never intended to limit network growth, but only to prevent DDoS attacks at a time when Bitcoin had little to no economic value.

Not *unmistakable* and again this is a terrible argument. You're opening with this?

&gt;First off, non-mining full nodes don't contribute to Nakamoto consensus, so they are irrelevant to either of the two forms of decentralisation that Satoshi raises in the white paper.

Not true. Full nodes enforce network rules, SPV do not. SPV does not validate signature data. 

&gt;(1) the POW blockchain as a “distributed” timestamp server that means no central authority mints new coins and processes transactions; (2) the need for honest nodes to maintain more than than 50% of hashing power to guarantee network security. If colluding, dishonest miners hold more than half of the network’s hashing power then it is toast. Your full node can orphan all of the blocks you want, but at the end of the day, if you're in disagreement with more than 51% of hashing power then all you're achieving is forking yourself onto a minority chain.

What's your point?

&gt;What about users who don't want to trust a third parties to verify their transaction? This is why we have two other options for non-mining users in the white paper. The first is to run a full node with pruned merkle trees (section 7), but its the second which is most important and widely misunderstood, simplified payment verification, which makes use of the block headers to verify transactions (section 8). Contrary to received wisdom it's simply wrong to say that SPV wallets rely on trusted 3rd parties—corporate data centres etc—to verify transactions. SPV nodes verify transactions by linking the hash of the transaction to the merkle tree / block header. Defrauding an SPV node to accept a fake transaction would mean finding an astronomically improbable hashing collision, or else a sybil attack on the most recent block—but such an attack is just as likely to affect a non-mining full node.

That's not true, SPV only validates the given transaction against the block header, it doesn't validate that signature data is valid through relevant blocks. 

&gt;So, no, large blocks do not lead to centralisation.

What? How did you arrive at this conclusion? Your logic doesn't follow at all and you didn't even address miner centralization.

&gt;Right now, we are more than capable of scaling well beyond the block space needed to support the current demand for economic activity on the network, and there's no reason to think this will not be the case in the future.

Simply not true.

&gt;We all agree that miners have an economic incentive to maintain the required hardware for holding and validating the entire blockchain.

That doesn't mean much and doesn't stop hostile actors from involving themselves.

&gt;This was always the proposed design and it has only been disrupted by a bunch of economically illiterate computer scientists who came late to Bitcoin and think it more important that hobbyists can cheaply run their own full nodes than it is for the network to mature and continue to function as trustless peer-to-peer electronic cash.

Okay, you're entire argument is based around numerous logical fallacies. I don't agree with you about Satoshi's priorities, but I also don't give a shit about Satoshi. Discrediting developers based on the time they've been in the space or whatever is beyond stupid. Adam Back invented hash cash and was cited in the white paper. Your argument is merit-less like so many others on this sub. Sorry but I can't take any of this crap seriously. ",1525161887
"Dude, I'm sorry, but if you don't think a 16,000 coin dump will ""make much of a difference"" you don't understand the workings of this market. 
Those MTGox coins DO have the potential to move the market in a big way. Hopefully they get traded OTC or are drip-fed into the market, but regardless, small investors are still at the mercy of other large holders who are capable of crashing the market pretty hard. 
Those large balances are the elephant in the room. They are there for all to see but nobody really wants to acknowledge them. 
Posts that do acknowledge that we investors are at the mercy of some random BTC millionaire get downvoted because, well, let's just try and push that idea out of sight and out of mind (a human trait that seems magnified in this crypto world, along with a couple other characteristics we have).
In my opinion there are still a few shakeouts to come before this market settles to the point where we can use crypto as actual currency (no shit Sherlock) and I think a lot of investors will unfortunately get hurt in the process. The reason I think this is because I believe in the general idea that there is no free lunch. 
This space seems overpopulated with people that haven't learnt that basic premise, but that's ok. I think that's mainly because crypto is populated by a relatively youthful majority and the youth can bounce back if they lose a chunk of dough. 
Anyway, I believe Bitcoin is here for the long term. I think it has a solid foundation and a resilience that other coins do not have. Be careful not to invest more than you can afford to lose and you can ride the market without worry as it plays out. There will be swings larger than today's 5% to come and it's not worth the stress to have too much invested on them. 
I think there's still time to gradually get into the market. 
Disclaimer: I suck at predicting which way this thing goes.

"&gt; The script is 'turing complete' in a useless way that a turing machine can emulated on it, but that approach is never going to be practical for anything. 
&gt;It's of course possible to add more opcodes that allow more things, but then bitcoin cash is going to have the exact same scaling challenges ethereum has. There's no free computational lunch.

Maybe you should actually try reading the resources given there bud.  The way Bitcoin (BCH) does smart contracts is by putting hashes of the smart contracts on the blockchain rather than putting the whole smart contract on the blockchain.  This means it is functionally equivalent to anything any other smart contract coin can do, but without the need for rich opcodes or creating gas.  All you do on BCH is put the hashes of files and programs on the blockchain.  By definition a hash is of fixed length, that means you can do petabytes of calculations off-chain, and the length of the hash proving you did the calculation will be the same size, a couple of bytes.  So in other words, absolutely nothing you said here is accurate, all you did was assume that it couldn't be done that way even though if you have a basic understanding of hash functions its quite simple to prove possible.  Obviously this makes programming smart contracts much harder for developers, which is why Ethereum was made.  But what is easiest isn't always best.  Google hash functions and you'll figure it out.  There's no point to storing all the computations on the blockchain so long as you can prove you ran a program through a hash function.  This also eliminates the gas issues since on BCH you pay per byte, and since there is no computation done on the blockchain, there is no need for gas.  If your smart contract OpCode adds extra bytes to the blockchain, you pay a higher fee.  But the fee will always be minimal since all you add to the blockchain are hashes, which by definition are a small fixed length.

"That is why you DO NOT base market cap on total coin supply.    

If all of stellars coins were put into circulation today the price per coin would plummet and the likely the market cap would be the same as it is today.

It does not matter how many coins stellar or tron or eos devs own ~  the current prices are based on what the market determines is fair price today.   

So why is ripple worth what it is?    Why is bitcoin valued the way it is?

Answer:  the current price is exactly what the market is willing to pay for it.    

Does EOS or BCH or BTC deserve their current value?  What assets do they have to justify it?  What income do they have to justify it?

Crypto simply is not judged the same way companies are.   If crypto was judged in the same manner as companies and their stock then bitcoin would not even be worth 5 dollars.",1525159787

"**Expected value**

In probability theory, the expected value of a random variable, intuitively, is the long-run average value of repetitions of the experiment it represents. For example, the expected value in rolling a six-sided die is 3.5, because the average of all the numbers that come up in an extremely large number of rolls is close to 3.5. Less roughly, the law of large numbers states that the arithmetic mean of the values almost surely converges to the expected value as the number of repetitions approaches infinity. The expected value is also known as the expectation, mathematical expectation, EV, average, mean value, mean, or first moment.

"I'm gonna need a specific definition of what they mean when these sorts of guys say ""investment"" and ""gambling"" and how they're different.  If it's just because ""well it's not a stock or a commodity"", then that's pretty narrow minded.

The only one I've ever heard that makes any sense is this:

 - Gambling is when the [expected value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value) is less than one.  Horse racing, casinos.  The house edge means you don't break even statistically.
 - A bet or wager is when the expected value is equal to one.  The winner pays the loser.  The odds equal the inverse of the reward.
 - Investment is when the expected value is greater than one.  You put money in and expect to get more back over the longer term.  This still isn't a guarantee of course -- businesses go bust.

Now, of course in many cases we don't know the exact odds of success, or the exact reward in the event -- but you make an estimate and if that results in EV &gt; 1 you're investing.

Bitcoin is in no way gambling.  We're talking about potential rewards of at least x10.  We might reasonably estimate the chance of success (success being, that we get that x10) as greater than 10%.  `x10 x 10%` is 1.0 ... so if you agree with those two minimums then you agree that buying Bitcoin is an investment.  Certainly when Bitcoin was a dollar and we were talking about x10,000 potential rises, then any chance of success of more than 0.01% made Bitcoin a reasonable investment, and there are plenty around who made that analysis and were rewarded for it.

If Warren Buffet doesn't agree with those estimates _that's absolutely fine_ -- but he should have to give his numbers, and offer some rational reasons for them before he is taken seriously.  Since he repeatedly says ""I don't understand it"" -- then I find it hard to see how his numbers can be trusted anyway.",1525159646

My purchases are reasonably small (have 1 eth and 1 LTC) but I’m happy to hold for a long time. I bought in January and won’t even look at selling until I’ve had them for 12 months.

"&gt;Bitcoin is probably and will be the only cryptocurrency despite its fees and transaction times

I disagree.  I think unless a major flaw is found, users would much prefer a tangle network.  Bitcoin is flawed at the core because it is only cheap enough to send when the price in usd is super low or when there is no volume.  Tangle stays free and instant even for micro transaction, and only gains speed the more transactions are added.

I for one believe in free and fast for real change.",1525159270

"I am from cyber security field, and we process a lot of information, so privacy and GDPR has been drilled into our heads pretty thoroughly.

I like IOTA mainly because it has so many things removed that I hated about cryptocoins. Namely there is no mining, and it does support data removal, so the tangle does not bloat and become inefficient like blockchain does. You can run IOTA node on Rock 64 which is $44 Raspberry pi clone.

https://medium.com/@perfectstormtd/deploying-full-iota-node-on-a-rock64-4gb-arm64-board-34d3f6cb473a

Also I like the fact that IOTA has partnerships and upcoming real life applications with Fujitsu, Bosch and VW. Which means that at price of $2, the coin is very attractive.

&gt;Do you have a primer or a cheat sheet that you use to rate coins based on these requirements?

Not anything I would have written down, but here are some easy checks.

Have they published a privacy policy? It is a must have for being able to operate in EU. Some have privacy policy for their website, but not for the coin. IOTA also covers the coin. https://www.iota.org/research/privacy-policy

Are transactions fully open ledger? You can stalk anyone on Bitcoin if you know their address as you know the sender and receiver for each transaction. In IOTA you see only the sender. https://iotasear.ch/transaction/TMRCQQYQKFCVVDZKMCJGZVHSSPLT9DSWXVJVUAXPNYZNNXOKWYRH9KBCSIMQ9GPOSXUQZMJHGUCF99999

Can fight to be forgotten supported. Blockchains do not allow data removal, but if transactions are private then it is supported by default when association between address and person is removed. IOTA has privacy, and it supports data removal. There is a pruning mechanism called snapshot, that removes all empty wallets. So empty your wallet and your data is gone on next snapshot.

"Guys, noticed that ADGM (Abu Dhabi Global Markets) free zone in United Arab Emirates together with its regulator 'Financial Services Regulatory Authority' (FSRA) have issued a consultation paper on how they want to regulate crypto assets and markets.

If they implement these regulations, one could operate a regulated crypto exchange in a tax free environment. It doesn't say anything whether they want to ban any crypto activity which is not regulated by themselves. I think they cannot do that (even if that wanted) as they do not have jurisdiction outside of the freezone which they are regulating.
