"Being a ""fraud"" means passing yourself on for someone who you're not.  It doesn't mean that he's actually committed fraud. He's passing himself on as Satoshi, or at least as a technical expert in Bitcoin.  The recent work done by Sirer, Rizun, Buterin, Poon and Lee show that he's actually way out of his depth technically.  There's nothing wrong with that, but the fact he acts like he's an expert despite having all of his work debunked is what makes him a fraud. ",1522997786

"
&gt; Your posts mentions nothing about the technology, the economics, the use cases or the governance of the project. Rather, it's a personal attack on somebody who is not even involved with the project anymore, so your entire post is irreverent.

First off, he founded EOS. He was one of the masterminds behind the project, how that isnt irrelevant is beyond me. Also its irrelevant so ""You need to at least know what you are talking about. I mean you couldn't even be bothered to spell correctly"". See how easy it is to do that? Did i now make your whole post 'irreverent' too? No i didnt.

Secondly, they announced his retirement from his role at EOS, he still is in 'transitioning' and they even says he is going to be an independent 'community builder' and focusing on 'investment activities'. To me this reads that he is far from being done with EOS, he might not become a public figure anymore, but an independent advisor role most likely still is a possibility (though i have zero proof of this).

Secondly, EOS themselves lied about Brock Pierce involvement right here:

&gt; Brock Pierce was an early advisor to Block.one for several months and made significant contributions to the awareness of the EOSIO project. 

He wasnt an early advisor, he CO FOUNDED Block.one AND EOS. 

Now about this:
&gt; The project was not created by Brock Pierce, not even close. It was create by Dan Larimer, the creator of Bitshares and Steemit. 

Nope. Here you go:
https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/17/blockchain-capital-raising-150-million-for-two-funds.html
&gt; Blockchain Capital was founded in 2013 by brothers Bart and Bradford Stephens along with Brock Pierce, chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation. 

And then:
https://disruptive.asia/block-one-eos-cryptocurrency/

&gt;Block.one calls the sale of EOS a “token distribution.” The company wants EOS to be used by large businesses, enabling corporations to automate processes, monitor assets, and create multiple applications.

&gt; Brock Pierce, co-founder of block.one, told Reuters that EOS aims to be the foundation for business applications in the blockchain world.

&gt; The token sale will take place over a one-year period on Ethereum, another blockchain-based currency, and some 1 billion tokens would be sold over 341 days starting on June 26, Pierce said.

Now about this part
&gt; Also, the guy is not a ""known child molester"". He was never found guilty. Hell, he was never even charged. He was only accused. 

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bitcoin-foundation-resignations/bitcoin-foundation-hit-by-resignations-over-new-director-idUSBREA4F02B20140516

&gt; “The allegations against me are not true, and I have never had intimate or sexual contact with any of the people who made those allegations,” Pierce told Reuters via email. Court records show 33-year-old Pierce, who played the title role in Disney’s “First Kid,” paid more than $21,000 to settle one employee suit, and he said others dropped their claims without money changing hands. 

He settles for one, the other charges got dropped. His buddies at DEN though, they did get charged. Go watch this documentary and tell me again how it only was 'accused':
https://vimeo.com/142444429

About the rest, i can give you credit. I never invested further on in to EOS tech, but then again why in the world would i know? The moment i knew about Brock Pierce involvement, the fact that your glorious Dan knew about him yet still wanted to work with him, says enough to me. If you condone it, you are a part of it, just with murder - if you dont report it you are an accessory to it.  Even if EOS is fully open sourced, hell even if its truly an ethereum killer, i will never endorse it and if you have ANY morale, you shouldn't either. But i know, greed is a powerful thing, and some are just lost in it.

"&gt;Where am I wrong?

You haven't realised that miners get paid for a service they offer users - secure timestamping of what order transactions occurred in. Satoshi's solving of the double spend problem. Miners get rewarded for that service through the block reward and also fee collection.

To use your analogy... the miners that are producing blocks have electricity and miner hardware costs to cover. If the miners decide to fork to a different protocol rule the users are not happy with this is what happens: The users nodes reject any blocks the miners produce. The users are the ones who send their BTC to exchanges to sell and also buy BTC from exchanges. Unless the miners follow the users (who are the ones giving BTC its economic value) what are they mining? Worthless strings of letters and numbers. It costs the users nothing at all to sit and wait for miners to act rationally and start mining blocks that conform to the user's nodes consensus rules. IT costs the miners hundreds of thousands a day to mine worthless blocks. Miners will switch back to mining and providing a service they will get paid for. It's why SW2X failed before it hard forked - users demonstrated that they would not follow the fork and dump any SW2X coins they found themselves with. Miners like to project the idea they are in control on some network (BCH for example) so that users of that network give up their nodes and 'trust' miners. With Bitcoin itself 90%+ of hash rate could not force a change because miners know that Bitcoin users and economically active nodes would not have placed any value on their forked coin. 

If every Bitcoin user had believed the 'only mining nodes matter' narrative pushed by miners and just ran SPV nodes Bitcoin would also be powerless to oppose miner changes - which let's face it - will always benefit the miner and not the user. Luckily a lot of economically active Bitcoin users run nodes and have a say. Miner provide a service they get paid for - if they stop providing that service they will not get paid and some other miner that does want to get paid will provide it. 

&gt;your Rasberry-Pi-node will not stop them.

My Raspberry Pi determines what I accept as Bitcoin - and Bitcoin is something I am willing to pay for and be paid in. If a miner changes the rules then I do not accept what they mine as Bitcoin and give it no value. Obviously my one node alone doesn't have much impact - that's why there is something called consensus. My nodes and thousands of others are all in consensus of what Bitcoin is. Together they make sure that no foul play is occurring on the network. ""Rules enforced without the need for Rulers"". You give that up as a community and run SPV only and you have handed the network to a relatively small number of users (miners). There will be nobody left to check that the protocol is being followed. The biggest threat is not double spends but doing away with the block halving, upping the 21M coin limit etc.

So...

&gt;Where am I wrong?

You do not understand that miners get paid to provide a service and that a node sets the rules for what that service should be and what value the coins mined have by accepting them. If a miner fails to provide that service their blocks will be rejected and they will not get paid. Users can sit out low hash power longer than miners can sit out not getting paid.

I see lightning as a positive step towards many accumulated micropayments, like say you wanted to pay per KB of data consumed of a coffee shop's WiFi, but just parking/funding your Bitcoin in channels with nodes that are well connected, sounds very much like funding your bank account.

Having said this, it is still very attractive because an uncorrelated asset is a holy grail in portfolio allocation.

My big problem with Rand is that she - like certain academics around here who shall remain nameless, basically thought of humans in very one dimensional terms. But I think her orientation was correct - the individual as the center of one's universe. This is obviously true. Maybe even True? The difference, as far as I can tell, between a post-modernist and a pragmatist is going to ultimately come down to - do you hate yourself or do you love yourself? 

If you hate yourself you say things like - the wellbeing of the collective is more important than any individuals wellbeing. *Even if it means lying*. This is Cypher wanting to be plugged back into the matrix. He desires unconsciousness. He's basically saying ""it doesn't matter if we're all slaves because life is meaningless anyways"". Lie to me if it means I won't have to put any effort into my life. 

This is why Truth with a capital T is important. Without it, the human race *is finished*! 

Ok then *SO*, If you love yourself you'll say things like - *my* wellbeing depends on the health of the collective wellbeing. The goal is ""selfish"" but the effort ends up being outward facing. That's Neo! That's *freedom or death*. That's also Jesus. Tell the truth until they kill you because the alternative is *HELL*.

So which one is bitcoin? Immutable uncensorable truth available to anyone who bothers to look. That's why it's safe to conclude the Life and Truth are basically synonymous terms. If there's no Truth humanity will to go to hell and then die.

"&gt;What do you think the No2X brigade was about?

Preventing: A) a hard fork to double the base block size just a short time after Segwit already enabled an increase. B) Handing over control of the network to a small number of people.

You realise that blocks over 2MB have been mined on Bitcoin right? 

&gt;you're prepaying a company

No you aren't - the funds remain in your custody - they are secured by a 2 of 2 multisig on Bitcoin and you can redeem your funds when you want. 

&gt;at a single store

?! You know that lightning nodes are connected to other nodes right? So a connection to the one 'company' in your example means you can pay anyone else in some way connected to it. So look here: https://lnmainnet.gaben.win/ if you connect to any of those nodes you can pay any other it is indirectly connected to. You are talking about regular 'payment channels' - as proposed by Satoshi - LN is interconnected payment channels, which lets you pay other people, not just the node you are connected to.

&gt;the scaling solution shouldn't come from artificial limits on usability.

The limits are to prevent the network becoming centralised. Keeping the base layer decentralised means not having things like 32MB blocks and instead scaling on additional layer like good network designs do. And you will say 'but moore's law'. That might work for some people in countries with great internet access and the money to buy high spec machines but if you want a decentralised global currency it should run on cheap equipment whilst retaining its decentralised nature.

&gt;What do you think the Core developers are?

Not a central body in charge. You already mentioned SW2X. Do you know what the SW part of that was about? Segwit took many many months to be activated. If core were 'in charge' that would not have taken that long. No central body is in charge of Bitcoin - not miners (see SW2X for ref - 90% hash rate couldn't for a change), not developers (Segwit - despite massive developer support it took an age and years of debate to get it activated).",1522996008

"The US dollar of the 19th century had periotic bouts of inflation in booms, and deflation in busts, basically because of its gold backing. Few people Hodled dollars during deflation periods, because times were tough, and most people had to spend down their savings on basics. It was tough, but you just waited it out and the next boom started. No currency has been deflationary for a long time that I know of, but crypto may change that.  

I would argue that pretend inflationary quantitative money is largely responsible for the recent 'wealth', but this is not real, and wont last forever. Many people online call it the 'Everything Bubble', as almost all first-world assets have greatly increased in value since the financial crisis of 2008. My house, more than doubled, same for stocks, same for cryptos, same for Magic The Gathering Cards, I mean damn near everything is booming, and that is not normal. and It seems unlikely that it will end well.

I'm not advocating a Deflationary currency, I am advocating for a DIS-inflationary currency. Specifically, prices remain stable and don't go up or down. It would actually be fairly easy to do, if say, everyone accepted 20 packs of forever stamps for their current face value, just as we use dollars now, then you would have a Disinflationary currency, because they would never lose value, at least not over a period of years, as postage rates rise with inflation.

As to your last comment, everyone DOES NOT benefit from inflation. Everyone holding dollars loses to inflation, even if its only a little, but it really hurts older people, that are living on savings, and cant earn new inflated dollars at a faster rate, like the working age people can. Its just an unfair tax, and we don't have to pay it anymore, if we just get out of the fiat system.",1522995771

Divide 2020 by 600 (seconds in 10 minutes), and you have 3.366..., which is theoretically the max transactions/sec on Bitcoin. Ethereum has different numbers, as do all standard block chains.

What if it was god's plan not to interfere and let us decide whatever happens to Bitcoin?,1522994551
"&gt; I've read many articles and come across it in many locations talking about how Lightning just isn't as distributed or decentralized as Bitcoin Cash or most other leading cryptos.

You are really mixing up concepts here so let's try to untangle it so you can apply your reasoning to it so you don't have to take anyone else's word for it.

What we are talking about is decentralisation, you have been calling it distributed but I guess that is just a terminology and while it is not perfect it is 'close enough'.  We all know what the opposite is, centralised systems and we all know examples of them.  

VISA and PayPal are centralised systems, they are a single authority that can basically do whatever they want within their system.  If they decide not to let you or I transact we can't, if they decide to close our account they can.  They have authority over us within their system.

Bitcoin, on the other hand, is decentralised and has no authority.  No one can stop your or I transact, no one can remove our balances.  There is no authority out there that can do anything against our wishes.

So, the litmus test for decentalisation is having an authority... are you following me?

Now, you can apply your reasoning to it, who is the authority in LN?  Who can stop you from transacting?  Who can remove your balance?  

&gt; You really think Lightning is more secure than Monero?

Again, I think you're mixing this a bit.  Security is provided by miners, the chain with the most work in it is the most secure.

Perhaps you mean anonymity?  I say that because Monero beats anything else hands down at anonymity, bitcoin or bitcoin cash don't come close.  LN is a vast improvement over both but Monero still beats it.

&gt; Again I ask, aren't there other coins that are faster and cheaper that BTC or got there before BTC did?

Sure, litecoin and ETH are faster than bitcoin and bitcoin cash but not as fast as LN, there are coins out there that are free to transact.  There are a lot of single-use causes for a lot of altcoins...  LN is giving us them on bitcoin though... got to be a good thing right?",1522994545
"Wow.

It does have multiple innovative features and it's a few years old. Therefore, I appreciate it.

I just feel personally it might be overreaching with all it's trying to offer. It also advertises as 40x faster than BTC, based solely on block time, when that is too simple a statement to be true, while also claiming to have the fastest blocks of all related cryptocurrencies, and that's doubtful to me. But besides those things, modern technology has provided superior currencies that dedicate themselves to the individual features. As a whole, DigiByte may be better but as they say, you can't please everyone. Doing so just makes you not especially liked by everyone.

Despite all that, I said it was an option we'd try to get to. Right now, we're focusing on getting an usable service up. After that, we'll prioritize what coins we're adding next.",1522994523
"Ok yeah I'd tend to agree with you except we've seen throughout history disruptive tech getting viciously attacked by the established industry that stands to loose it's old business model. Bitcoin is kind of like an baby in utero right now. If it doesn't grow to a certain size the block reward won't be enough to keep miners working on it. *They* know that, but it seems like the bitcoin community is completely ignorant of it.

"&gt; Funny you can't back up your own ignorance. Do you know the definition of an ETF? It tracks an underlying index. 

No. It doesn't. Some do. Some don't. Example: A gold ETF. Many gold ETFs literally buy and hold the gold bullion (others hold futures contracts). This is not a ""diversified index fund"" as you claim. It's literal gold bullion.

Again, you're wrong.

&gt;If this was about a cryptocurrency ETF then your position would be less idiotic, even though that kind of ETF would be far too correlative to bitcoin to make any sense whatsoever. But you're arguing for a bitcoin ETF. That's just plain stupid. Do you understand yet? It's like creating an ETF that just tracks Apple stock. Why not just invest in Apple? If you don't get this, you need to learn more. It's a waste of my time, but this is seriously a fundamental problem with you crypto nutjobs. You can't see plain obviousness.

Again, just look at the gold ETF example. Other commodities examples, you might start to understand why you're so wrong.

Hell, it's literally in the name. It's not an ETIF, it's an ETF. Exchange traded fund. A fund does not necessarily need to be diversified and does not need to represent an index. A fund can just be a fund that holds a single asset if it pleases.

Let's take another example, LICs, you might invest in an LIC - but that LIC only holds a single stock as it's underlying asset, say, coca cola. I suppose you're scream and rant and rave about how stupid it is to buy the LIC instead of just buying KO. So you buy KO direct and give the finger to the LIC. The next day the LIC dumps KO and reinvests elsewhere because they saw it was overbought, they make a tonne of cash, and you're down because again, you're a dumbass.

and **again** I'll quote you in full so anyone else can read this and judge. I don't want you editing or deleting your comments when you realise how wrong you are.

"Good to see that you have your feet planted on the ground, diversified your investments, and that you do it for fun and are not all-in or dependent on a sustained crypto income. You do it for fun and buy crypto with your electricity bill, that is thumbs up no-lose situation.

I saw people get caught up in the mining craze late 2013 myself, one person quit everything else to mine full time. Then in the start of 2014 there was a lot of disillusioned and demotivated career miners and I think we will see the same pattern happen again now and in five years time after the next boom and bust cycle.

Since around 2014 everyone has been discouraged to mine unless they want to pay a premium for the crypto. Since 2016 the market cap of crypto has been on an upwards trend and in Jan-December 2017 it went of the rails, the price of Ethereum went up 100x over the year while the difficulty had a hard time following the price as there was a production bottleneck for GPUs and a delay in time to install them. This gave a false impression that it would be possible to earn back the cost of even priced-up hardware and high electricity costs in months and then make a steady profit afterwards.

But it will never be possible to buy capital (Machines) and have a ROI that does not span a large fraction of the lifetime of the machine when taking the operating costs into account.

Even if the price of crypto capped at 1 Trillion market cap and stayed there, and GPU coins took the majority of the market share, and there was no production bottlenecks so that everyone that wanted got a GPU at MSRP, the profitability would still decrease over time as more and better cards got produced and more individual and corporate miners came online.

The only way to make a reliable profit from mining is to rent out the hardware while taking a daily fee to cover the cost of electricity, labor and hardware use, but that is only viable in certain parts of the world with preferential taxation and electricity costs.",1522993502

"My original price calls were a drop to 2500, a short hop settling to 2000ish, followed by a steady modest rise back to 10K, followed by another launch to 100K as it passes 20K to 25K. But since the all time high actual struck closer to 20K, 6K and 5K might be the next floor. I'd still say there is a slightly greater than even chance we see the 2500/2000.

McAfee had it right, these time frames are so short and the amounts relatively insignificant in the field of finance, these market cap swings are still insignificant. If Facebook (FB) had only 21M shares they'd be worth $25K each. FB pervades the consumer market, but Bitcoin has the potential to be involved in every financial transaction.

Also, I don't mind so much that speculators get burned on the volatility. I think we will see these wild swings and busted speculators, because the hit-and-run and rush-in-rush-out investment strategies forged by the modern markets will NOT work in a deflationary fixed-supply currency. Long and steady will win the race. Although the pendulum will swing to the hodl end of the spectrum (as we've seen), we will learn the next valuable lesson, that you just can't hodl either. Bitcoin hodlers will learn some portion must be spent (exchanged) to preserve the currency's utility (relevance).

My strategy is buying X amount with fiat, spending 3/4, holding 1/4. I find anonymous donations and tips are 10x more valuable (effective awareness) than an ordinary spend. YMMV, but this has been my experience.

This is easy to demonstrate as false. My spending bitcoin that is immediately converted to fiat by behalf of Bitpay doesn't spur any kind of adoption. It actually creates negative price pressure. And that's what the vast vast majority of merchants do. In that scenario, spending does nothing for adoption. 

How could that change? 

If merchants actually *held* the Bitcoin, because they are confident in it as a store of value instead of just another payment option. 

By focusing on getting it accepted by merchants, you are getting causality exactly backwards. True acceptance by merchants and more people in general is a side effect of the money becoming gradually more trusted as a store of value. There's no shortcut for that.

All that needs to happen is someone who whats to undermine crypto or just quickly make a killing to    dump a shit ton of money into it to create a lot of fuss, then wait for the idiots to start taking out mortgages out on their houses to invest into something they have no clue about, then cash out, causing the price to fall. And there you have it, they made a ton and hurt crypto’s reputation. Now you have a bunch of hurt people bashing and talking crap trying to cut their losses and get out with only bad things to say about crypto. 

What happens when you corner a beast? It starts to fight back furiously, even though it doesn’t stand a chance. At its peak, crypto was a 550B market. So if you had 100B at your disposal, you can easily pump and dump the entire industry, walk away with a good profit and leave it with a bad reputation. 

I wouldn’t be surprised if this was a doing of a large banker or even a government who understands what bitcoin means for them, and don’t want it happening. 

On the other hand, if bitcoin held at 20k for a year of two, then suddenly went to 6k, then it would mean that its in serious trouble. But that little spike, that came and went means nothing. It will continue falling for a bit before it goes up, but then it will continue to rise. Historically, its been averaging 100% increase every month. A nice steady climb until this pump happened. So it will continue to do so once it recovers and the miners keep mining.

&gt;Efforts to list the first bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) may not be dead after all. According to a recent document published by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), formal proceedings on the matter are set to begin in the near future.

SEC Considers Rule Change

The SEC has launched an inquiry on whether to approve a rule change that would enable the New York Stock Exchange to list two bitcoin ETFs. The two ETFs in question were proposed by ProShares last year, but later withdrawn due to backlash from the Washington-based regulator.

The proposed funds would provide exposure to bitcoin futures contracts, giving investors a new way to diversify into the digital asset class.

According to the documents, the rule in question is Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the 1934 Securities and Exchange Act.

“The Commission is instituting proceedings pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the Act to determine whether the proposed rule change should be approved or disapproved,” the agency said. “Institution of such proceedings is appropriate at this time in view of the legal and policy issues raised by the proposed rule change. Institution of proceedings does not indicate that the Commission has reached any conclusions with respect to any of the issues involved.”

By opening formal proceedings, the SEC is allowing for additional analysis of whether the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act. The proposed change was first published for public comment on Dec. 26.
The Elusive Quest for Bitcoin ETFs

Several fund issuers have formally attempted to get their bitcoin ETF listed on a major exchange, but each one was struck down by the SEC over liquidity and valuation risks. ProShares, Direxion and Exchange Lssted Funds were the most recent issuers to formally withdraw their bid. VanEck, REX ETF and the Winklevoss brothers have all struck out on listing their bitcoin fund.

We speculated last week that bitcoin ETFs may be inching closer to reality after CBOE notified the SEC that it intends to pursue a listing. Chris Concannon, CBOE’s president, sent a letter to the agency arguing that a crypto-based fund would not require significant revision to existing rules governing valuation, liquidity and arbitrage. He added that each proposal “should be evaluated on a case by case basis in a manner very similar to previous funds and their underlying holdings.”

CBOE has encouraged the SEC not to stand in the way of crypto-based funds – an argument that has more merit given the exchange’s successful listing of bitcoin futures in December.

A crypto-backed ETF would theoretically enable more traders to access digital assets on the open market without having to rely on digital exchanges or wallet providers. For crypto assets themselves, it could mean greater institutional adoption and liquidity.

Some analysts argue that it’s only a matter of time before the first bitcoin ETF is launched. The only question is who will be the one to break the ice.

"I believe that Ethereum has a bright future. In comparison to EOS,  Ethereum will be more decentralization and likely a bit more secure. Also their perceived censorship-resistance might be better as well. This is of course after all the updates are integrated. 

However, ethereum will probably never have the throughput that EOS will have. Indeed, you do have to sacrifice some decentralization and security for speed. 

The reality is that we need both Ethereum and EOS in the crypto space. It gives businesses the option of deciding which factor is more important to them: more decentralization &amp; censorship resistance with less OR less decentralization/censorship resistance and more tps 

A hypothetical situation would be where something like Wikileaks would absolutely need Ethereum whereas something like Uber would want EOS.

"No, the USD actually does change in value second by second. You can see this yourself at www.oanda.com or any forex exchange. In 1 year it dropped ~25% vs the EUR, AUD etc. same against the JPY, then back up a few months later. The Zimbabwe dollar dropped 79 billion percent in one month (more volatility than any crypto ever). Freely floated fiat currencies such as the USD are very volatile.

The only difference between modern fiat and crypto is that fiat are backed by guns. Guns, tanks, bombers are the only thing that what gives them any more value than crypto. Other than that it’s usage acceptance and controlled scarcity - both have that. We saw in the case of Zimbabwe dollar that fiat is just as worthless as crypto if people stop accepting/using it.

Just as with crypto, anyone can create a new fiat currency. Microstates do this all the time. Their currencies have little value because few people accept them. Just as failed crypto currencies have no value because no one accepts them.

I don’t challenge that currently fiat currencies issued by a stable power are currently superior to commodities. Whether it will be superior in the future to crypto is still up for debate - hopefully we will live long enough to see. I’ll bet that central banks will start using crypto and countries will eventually back it with guns. At that point it’s really no different to fiat.",1522989160

Also I disagree with your second paragraph (this whole currency vs storage of wealth argument), you sound like a Bcash kinda guy but I will post my belief on what Bitcoin is.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Storage of value in the purest sense is money that:

**a)** retains value over time and

**b)** increases in value over time (deflationary).

*This is why Gold is a tier 1 asset despite never being used to buy groceries, coffee, entrance fees to clubs or pay bills. Storage of value rates higher than medium of exchange, otherwise fiat would be considered better than gold for reserve purposes but it isn't, (it's trash for storing wealth e.g. housing, healthcare and food all increasing comparatively) but makes an excellent medium of exchange - the functions are seperated.*

*Most Cryptos are probably both, but private storage of wealth is more critical at this point in time as we already have fiat and credit for shopping but not many avenues for savings that outpace inflation.*",1522987237
"Exactly, and the value related to the USD is inverse, so you would need to short the Bitcoin currently to hedge against the dollar.

They're not actually worth that. Taking the market caps at face value is misleading. The moment coins get liquidated the remaining stash all lose value. Google is worth so much more.

"Sure you make valid points, and bank runs are obviously a serious issue. On that note, you should read Diamond and Dwybvig. Regardless, Bitcoin is not a good solution for this as it is equivalent to sticking money under a mattress (with the added risk/reward of its price fluctuation). On that note, if you are willing to use bitcoin to hold all your savings, you'd have to extremely risk loving or borderline insane.
There are thousands of people in the academics and governments that are trying to solve this issue while keeping the benefits that banks give to society.

Lastly, that is not what bitcoin is intended for. Bitcoin (and well blockchain) is intended in essence to replace transaction intermediaries (not banks) such as visa or western union. Technically, bitcoin was initially a solution for the double-spending problem in a decentralized framework, and what people make of it nowadays is kind of ridiculous in my opinion.",1522986305

Idk, maybe it's just me, but it's hard for me to believe I'm getting in on the ""ground floor"" when EOS has raised in 12 months what google had made in 5 YEARS...",1522985954

"I don't think so. What is the FIRST thing that people will do during a crash? Sell sell sell. Bitcoin will bottom out within seconds if there is a crash because people don't think straight. They are panicked, and sell all their investments. Suddenly that 40k bitcoin hits like $500. That's what the millionaires want, a crash so they can buy it all for cash and then own everything. The 1% always rig the system because they have enough money to buy everything during the fire sale should the banks crash. Sure the upper middle class take the hit but the big players with huge reserves of cash can buy everything up.

Remember, if you are a giant mall owner, and suddenly ALL of your tenants can't pay rent, and you can't pay the bank, you are in big freaking trouble. I would love to know what Simon Malls would do in that situation? File bankruptcy to the builders and sit in trouble, or sell for 1/10 of a dollar to Warren Buffet?

I love the idea of the bitcoin trade happening, but is it realistic in the event of a financial collapse? It will be interesting to see what happens with this trade war and impending interest hike. Trump will cause a collapse, yes, but how and when is the issue.",1522985832

Immediately, I was struck by just how technically and unnecessarily difficult it was just to authenticate with the BitPay API server (requires bcmath and PHP 5.6, which we aren't on, on the live site, plus advanced public/private key creation and juggling). 

Well, it took me about 3 weeks but we went live 2 weeks ago. And guess what?! The number of cryptocurrency orders went from a slow, but growing, trickle to ... NOTHING. Just my first test order and then my last one the other day. Not a single successful order otherwise!

And not a single wallet I ever used, except Mycellium (which I stopped using years ago for Coinomi) supports BitPay.

So I threw up some logging on just how many people attempted cryptopayments. Lo and behold, the number has stayed more or less consistent, but it's just resulting in literally 100%-but-me failure to pay.

"It is created (out of thin air) when the loan is made, and deposited to the customer's account (and later transferred to the seller of the house). This is now a liability for the bank.

At the same time, a corresponding asset is created for the bank (the mortgage). So from the bank's perspective, it is in the same position as before, but new money has been injected into the economy.

This also means that when the mortgage is repaid, money is destroyed.

So money really only exists when there is debt. All the money you have represents a debt somebody owes.

"a bad one, you would need to short Bitcoin to hedge against the USD currently. ",1522985052
"Yes but as we know there are very deleterious elements (and given the choice many people would prefer their savings were not used for investment in asset bubbles), for example during a market crash in the cycle of a market, when everything valued in debt has reached a peak e.g. sub prime real estate, it starts to crash. The savings in reserve (fractional reserve) are so small they cannot support the crash in price of all the inflated asset classes. This knock- on effect can result in reprecussions, such as bank ""bail-ins"" where a bank can use up the reserve of peoples savings to catch the fall (bank insolvency), leaving little savings left in the banks for people to withdraw.

The classic historical context of this occurring is called a ""bank run"" whereby people line up at ATMs to withdrawal their cash in order to protect their wealth.

Savings are a backbone of an economy and modern economics has done a good job of promoting credit over wealth accumulation. i personally would rather my own savings remain just savings, in order to reduce risk that my wealth is wiped out or devalued in a crisis.

**Bitcoin is an attempt to provide a savings vehicle (a second choice) without the risks associated with fiat fractional reserve banking.**",1522985048
"oh rest assured it will. When in doubt just ask your self this question. In 10 years all these high tech teenagers will become the next banksters, managers, operators whatever.

A correlation between markets and crypto's are far from established. Bitcoin managed to crash 75% while the equities hang around record gains. 

You do know in 2008 the banks almost shut down? Came to within a hour or two of a total shut down. Now there's 7 or 8 times more debt in the system than then.

If it had not become a trading asset then it would be useless because no one would spend the money to mine BTC because of the electricity costs.

Whats your take.. will crypto have another round of bull again?,1522984552
"&gt; Why should I start thinking of it as that? 

Because if you don't you'll come to faulty conclusions as to the fragility of BTC.

&gt; That’s categorically not how any of this works.

That's the direction the space is moving in with cross chain atomic transactions. Right now most blockchains operate as their own siloed world computers. There's massive investment going into in the work required to develop the ""glue"" between chains, and segwit is a huge catalyst because of its relationship with XCAT.

&gt; It has its flaws,

Of course it does. Its terrible in many, practically unfixable ways. Namely, the centralizing hashing algorithm which was chosen for it. Unfortunately all other blockchains also have flaws that bitcoin doesn't have. For example, which PoW blockchain has more hash power than bitcoin? You'll be hard pressed to find one. That's a flaw that all other blockchains have, but BTC doesn't. This makes double spending exceedingly difficult, and conveys more investor confidence than any other chain, which makes it ideal as a settlement network and store of value.",1522984535

Government eradicated huge chunk of cash in order to force everyone to the banking sector so everyone could pour money in the banking system and bail out the failing banks. Bitcoin &amp; other cryptocurrencies provide a way out so obviously the government gets worried.

Do not sign any petition. The government is known to release all the email ids of anyone who has signed petitions publicly. Has happened before. Also, signing the petition puts you in grave danger. No one understands bitcoin properly right now and so you can get charged for money laundering if your tax returns aren't in order.

What you can do: keep using bitcoin. Bitcoin provides a way out of the government's control. It was a revolution that we all started. Don't think it will be easy. Use local bitcoins or mine them to obtain bitcoins. Purchase hotel bookings, flight tickets, computer &amp; other stuff from international companies that support bitcoin.

When will things change? : When the government sees that they don't have any control over bitcoin at all.

"I was there supporting Mike during the whole shitshow and I largely agree with his assessment. What worries me is what we could have possibly gotten wrong.  
1. What if the primary utility value of Bitcoin is not use in transactions?
2. What if we got the economics wrong? For example the classic economic equation MV=PQ implies that an increase in transactions (which is positively correlated with an increase in velocity) acts as effectively an increase in coin supply so by suppressing transactions, core contributed to Bitcoin's utility as a store of value.
3. What if overvalue some of the factors that contribute to utility present in Dash and undervalue the factors (such as superior infrastructure) present in Bitcoin?

Overall I think Hearn is right and Dash has a significant long-term advantage.  The lack of sophistication of new investors, short-term thinking of momentum-chasing day traders, and the greater number of fiat on-ramps pushed Bitcoin over the top and will keep it there for a time. As Dash catches up however, we can expect to see a whittling away of BTC market share, provided Dash core meets its development goals and we can find and choose a marketing method that results in a self-perpetuating ROI as the treasury grows.

The biggest problem I see going forward has little to do with Bitcoin other that to note that it has the same issue: volatility. A store of value coin is not as handicapped by volatility as one designed to actually be used as a currency. A tricked out UX like Evolution won't change that. We need good traders to buy the dips and sell the peaks, make profits and eat vol. It's a huge opportinity for people who know what they are doing or who get lucky and it is a minefield for those who don't.  ",1522981814

"No. When I'm a hashing, because of the first seen rule, I do not want to propagate my blocks through nodes, therefore I connect with as many miners as possible, eventually all.

"Mm if Bitcoin vanished overnight, I would say the people's ability to transact X-amount of their wealth was lost. It may not be physical, but it's no different than if all of a sudden banks around the world vanished, making peoples whose wealth were in the banks losing their wealth and ability to transfer it. But let me ask you, how would you define ""inherent value""? 

Also, would you consider ""information"" to have ""inherent value""? If the answer is yes, then what would you say makes a book valuable? The pages and physical material, or the ideas inside it?

Most people speak ""inherent value"" as something that can benefit a person, which is how you were attributing gold, right? It's *useful* beyond a store of value. Also, a piece of land is physical, yes. But if nothing can grow on it, nothing can be built on it, and nothing can be used of it, then it has no value to the person who owns it. Gold is useful, useful land is useful, and books with information are useful. Anything that is useful, we attribute a dollar tag to it.

So if we go by this standard of, ""inherent value"" as being something useful, then Bitcoin would meet that requirement out of the box, no? A lot of people just don't *see* the usefulness of a transparent ledger, or a decentralized network, and they don't know that the network can't be stopped by governments. 

One thing I'll concede about Bitcoin, however, is that it may be ""less useful"" if less people participate, and ""more useful"" if more people participate. Which is unlike chickens, where it doesn't matter how many people want or don't want my chicken, I can still have a chicken dinner at the end of the day.

 2. Bitcoin's network hash rate is way too massive for any single entity to control more than a few percents of it.

"Bitcoin Private is an shady project at best if not outright scam. Rhett Creighton (Founder of BTCP) is known for forking coins and abandoning them. He was the original creator of ZClassic which was a simple fork of ZCash with the 20% founders fee removed. ZClassic eventually died out and new developers forked off it to create ZenCash instead. Rhett has no role in Zencash and came up with the idea of ""revitalizing"" ZClassic via a fork into a new coin. 

He then chose to name that coin ""Bitcoin Private"" and give away coins to both Bitcoin &amp; ZClassic holders, with ZClassic holders getting significantly more. There is nothing special about BTCP, he chose that name soley for the brand recognition from ""Bitcoin"" and it's history of forks having good initial value. Even before the fork was completed, those behind BTCP were already trying to create as much hype as possible by putting out tweets [like this one saying a application to Binance was already in progress](https://twitter.com/bitcoinprivate/status/961410944080465920). BTCP offers absolutely nothing new over ZClassic, It's just a straight up clone and everything related to BTCP is either copy pasted or simply forked from someone elses project. Binance obviously would not be listing it, the goal of the tweet was to mislead people into thinking they would. The initial announcement of BTCP combined with various hype techniques lead to ZClassic being majorly pumped and then rapidly dumped after the fork. You know who had lots of ZClassic? Rhett Creighton, and you can bet he sold plenty of it at the top. 

Looking at BTCP wallets, they are all copy paste jobs or straight up forks from other projects. Their ""full node"" wallet is a [direct clone of the ZENCash Swing Wallet](https://i.imgur.com/TxrolrE.png) and they didn't even bother to update the documentation by replacing all mentions of ZENCash with BTCP. The Electrum wallet is obviously an easy copy paste job since it's entirely open source. The BTCP paper wallet is also just code taken from the zencash paper wallet github. You can also see how similar the websites look as well it's pretty obvious. [BTCP Paper Wallet Website](https://paperwallet.btcprivate.org/) &amp; [Zencash Paper Wallet Website](https://zenpaperwallet.com/). The mobile wallet is Coinomi, a third party team which have nothing to do with the BTCP team. I would love to see an example of just one single thing the BTCP team has coded themselves, and not stolen from another project. I've yet to find anything.

In terms of development since the fork occured, there has been nothing released. Moderators on the subreddit are now [claiming it will take months to incorporate SegWit support](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinPrivate/comments/89atti/general_daily_discussion432018/dwq9xkt/). They are also very busy bees at heavily censoring their sub banning users who post negative comments towards the project, as well as deleting their posts. Rhett Creighton has not shown his face on reddit once since the fork occurred. Practically zero exchanges have listed BTCP, and I'm personally glad to see that. The BTCP team claimed in one of their community updates HitBTC would have the coin listed before the end of March, which did not happen. Kucoin decided not to list BTCP as well. Only TradeSatoshi has listed BTCP in exchange for money so far. This project is shady as fuck and most likely only existed for the purpose of pump &amp; dumping ZClassic. ZENCash is the legitimate successor to ZClassic which forked a year ago and has a real team with real progress so I really don't see why anyone should be supporting BTCP. I strongly suspect BTCP will be a dead project by the end of this year.

"I have watched Chainlink rise and fall in the top 50-100 the past 6 months and still don't know what purpose the coin has.

"Please know all this about lightning before getting too excited 

Essentially, lightning only works as a scaling solution when everyone is already using it. It has no way to bridge the gap from no users(where it is starting) to everyone worldwide using it.

Worse, it has numerous tradeoffs that will discourage the average person from using it. This amplifies the downsides that arise from it not being universally in use instantly, and will prevent it from ever reaching that state. Here are those:

1. You must be online all the time to be paid. And the person you want to pay must be online for you to pay them.

2. If you go offline at the wrong time and aren't using a centralized hub, you can lose money you didn't even knowingly transact with.

3. The solution to #2 is to enlist ""watchers"" to prevent you from losing money. More overhead the average person isn't going to care about or understand, and more fees that have to be paid. Or people will just be forced to use centralized hubs.

4. Two new users to Lightning will not be able to actually pay eachother without using a centralized hub because no one will lock up funds into the opposing side of their channels; No funded channels = can't pay eachother. Hence... Hubs.

5. Using hubs will come with monthly fee; They aren't going to lock up their capital on your behalf for no cost.

6. The entire system is vulnerable to a mass-default attack. Hubs are especially vulnerable.

7. Lightning will not be able to route large payments(no route available).

8. Lightning transactions are larger than normal transactions.

9. Lightning nodes must keep track of the full history of channel states themselves. If they lose this, they are vulnerable to attacks and may lose coins.

10. Attackers may randomly lock up funds anywhere along the chain of channels for extended periods of time(many hours) at no cost to themselves.

11. The network randomly may fail to work for a user under certain circumstances for no discernable reason as far as they can see (no route available). 


And the issues directly related to the not having everyone on the planet on lightning at first:

1. Small payments consolidating into larger ones, such as a retailer who needs to pay vendors, will fail to route on Lightning, and the loop between the source of the payments(end users) and their destinations(retailers) is broken. This means every channel will ""flow"" in one direction, and need to be refilled to resume actually being used.

2. Refilling every channel will be at least one onchain transaction, possibly two. If this happens twice a month, 1mb blocks + segwit will only be able to serve 4 million users. Some estimates are that Bitcoin already has 2-3 million users.

3. Regardless of lightning's offchain use, Bitcoin must still have enough transaction fees to provide for its network security. Except instead of that minimum fee level being shouldered by 1000 - 500000 million transactions, it is only shouldered by ~170 million transactions with segwit 1mb blocks.
That situation doesn't exist in a vacuum. Users will have a choice - They can go through all that, deal with all of those limitations, odd failures &amp; risks and pay the incredibly high fees for getting on lightning in the first place... Or they can just buy Ethereum, use a SPV wallet, and have payments confirmed in 15 seconds for a fraction of the fees. Or roughly the same choice for SPV+BCH.

The choice will be obvious.

My (and many others) opinion is that lighting is not near as good as people think it will be... It just isn't a scaling solution. Lightning is fine for use cases that need to do frequent, small, or predictable payments with few entities. For example, mining pools paying PPLNS miners. Or gamblers making small bets on gambling sites. Or traders making frequent trades on exchanges.

But as a general purpose scaling solution for average people? It sucks, and they are absolutely not going to go through all of that shit just to use crypto, especially not with better, cheaper, more reliable options out there.",1522978728
I definitely disagree. These crashes happen every so often. It seems like to me things keep moving faster and faster. I think that big funds getting involved and the technology becoming really ripe this year we will see a 50k bitcoin before it crashing again. That’s my opinion.

"&gt;Because you think bitcoin is a mesh.

You'd do better to not assume what others think.

It doesn't matter if the honest miners are connected in a complete graph. There _are_ nodes that have limited connections and they form a mesh. The selfish miner could send the block to any one of those nodes and it will very quickly come at the honest miners from multiple directions.",1522978699
"Low quality crypto is promoted by low quality ""news"" network, sounds fitting to me",1522978699
"I’m not trying to be condescending. I’m trying to change the views of so many people who think gold is absolutely worthless beyond “shiny rock”.  As far as having properties ideal for a currency, the precious metals family of elements has been unparalleled for millennia.  (Until bitcoin, that is.)

That makes it valuable. Gold is well-suited to the task of being a currency for more reasons than “ooh shiny” as you originally claimed. ",1522978655

Repeat after me . . . . . banks can NOT lend their own capital.  

Whose money are they lending then?  They are lending you your own DEBT IN TRANSIT.  ""Money"" as defined by the state is DEBT IN TRANSIT.  ""Money"" is ACCOUNTING.  When you get a loan or swipe your credit card you are authorizing a TRUSTEE (the bank) to debit the SECURITY of your PERSON.  You borrow from your own credit and pay back the middleman!!!  Suckers!

Watch moneyasdebt.net the first two videos.  The existing system MUST ""create new money"" to survive.  It's simple math.  There MUST be new money (DEBT IN TRANSIT) created in order to mathematically have enough to pay the interest on all the existing money/debt.

"Hijacking top comment because I want to add that on top of all the great points made by OP, bitcoin originally also had the potential to end political corruption and inefficiency once and for all (I'm not super techy but I think with a decentralized autonomous organization type program to manage various government departments and colored coins that can't be spent for anything other than what they were budgeted for--and probably other functions that I don't even know about). Think about how much better the governments of the world would function with blockchain style openness and accountability. When people talk about computers automating jobs they rarely think of government officials, but it's totally possible and would change this world for the better in unfathomable ways.

(I know ethereum's DAO had some major security issues and making an entire government out of computer code would be insanely complicated but I'm hoping that one day they'll figure out how to do it securely.)

"*""Fractional-reserve banking is the practice whereby a bank accepts deposits, makes loans or investments, but is required to hold reserves equal to only a fraction of its deposit liabilities.""*

**ELI5**: Banks reserve approximately 10% of your savings deposits (your savings account), the rest is loaned out (spent) as credit through for Real Estate, credit cards, car loans etc.

This means that asset bubbles are blown due to the availability of credit, and when they collapse at the end of the cycle, there's only approx 10% of cash kept as reserve to fall back on. Which makes things nasty when SHTF.

A lot of people also don't like that banks spend $90 out of every $100 they deposit into a bank, with Bitcoin nobody is loaning out your coins so there's less risk.

In the FAQ you say that you pay about 90 sat/byte for transactions or 20 bit per transaction in mining fees. It is no need to pay more than 1 sat/byte for Bitcoin Cash. You can still charge users 100 bits for withdraws while only paying 1 sat/byte on the actual transaction, as you are a faucet i makes sense to have protections against faucet abuse.

"Enjoy your losses crypto lovers. Originally had favorable views for crypto until I realized how impractical it was to do small transactions and convert cash to crypto.

When I started to analysis it on a deeper level the flaws started to really appear.

There is no money to be made trading crypto anymore either. The short side is overcrowded the transaction fees and movement of money is a pain in the ass. You don't even know if the exchange your using will be solvent when its time to cash out. The manipulation of whales is rampant and apparent, You can't even trust tether! Who knows when that will fail?

 I don't want to hang around for the final phases, its going to be a depressive meltdown of millennials that lost most of their savings. There is going to be a lot of people that will be getting burned.

They are getting coin awareness in the public vs just in an exchange. Then look at what big Chinese exchanges are doing. Just adding more shitcoins. Same thing as rent seeking.

Then a quiet period of 6-36 months. It's done that 4 times, and I think every pump drags more people in that believe in the philosophy of crypto, and become hodlers. The drop comes from speculators first stepping in, then out quickly to make a profit. We'll see a clear curve upward, lasting 1-4 months, before a next spike.",1522975750

A decent comparison is the internet itself.  It's not really directly regulated (globally, but it is in some countries) because that's impossible.  However those individuals/companies that use it are regulated.  If Bitcoin is to become mainstream I see no real difference here. So we need to manage the narrative with regulators to ease acceptance rather than ignore and dismiss them enabling the FUD to set the tone.

The things listed here about governments losing control of money supply are provocative (to them) and will lead to a far less receptive response than a more positive, collaborative approach.

"First off, let me say that I'm a software engineer and I've been in crypto since 2013. I first discovered Bitcoin and after some research, realized that it had huge potential to change the word.

Not everybody buying EOS is clueless, new or chasing a pump. You posts mentions nothing about the technology, the economics, the use cases or the governance of the project. Rather, it's a personal attack on somebody who is not even involved with the project anymore, so your entire post is irreverent. This shows that you know very little about the project, yet you still have formed an opinion based on your emotions. Rather than boycott a potential competitor to your investment, learn about it. Research it. If you still think that your investments are better choices than the competitor, great. If not, reconsider your current investments. No reason to boycott anything, just ignore it if you don't like it.

&gt; an exit scam seems so much like the logical next step.

The EOS 1.0 code was finished today, its open source on Github. There is no way for them to exit scam, because they don't have anybody's money. The EOS code is there. The dev team is not launching the chain, an independent community member is. EOS would still get launched and the tokens would be swapped to the chain automatically.

"LN has me thinking about how it's often a good idea to divide money into two pools:

- **savings** Hard to use and keys kept offline. Think retirement or vacation fund.
- **spending** Easy to use and keys kept online. Think walking-around money.

This way, a compromise of the spending pool doesn't compromise the savings pool.

Having used the early Lightning wallets a little bit, they seem positioned as a good method for managing walking-around money:

- instant confirmation, useful in brick+mortar POS systems and online alike;
- no need to monitor the block chain if just spending;
- can be used to pay for metered services;
- can be used for micropayments;
- account model is a natural fit for LN wallets, unlike the UTXO model that causes so much confusion among new users who will likely start out with walking-around money only;
- fees will likely be based on the amount of money sent, not the far more abstract notion of transaction size/weight.

The transition probably won't be easy or quick. The on-chain mobile wallets developed over the last 5 years will pretty much be useless under LN. It's not the kind of thing that will lend itself to being bolted on.

But I do expect to see a burst of innovation around LN walking-around wallets. It's not unreasonable to think that this could lead to a resurgence of interest by merchants in Bitcoin as a form of payment - especially for smaller payments and metered services.",1522974550

"Typical semi-dumb *Wired* story. This idea amounts to asset forfeiture. In order to implement it, a given bitcoin address would have to be formally charged with a crime. It would only work if the indicted address resided in a registered third party, like Coinbase, and the holding party kept it there. But if it is your own self-created address, certainly no one could seize it. And it is inherently counterproductive. Consider the following comment from the story:

*And if innocent users end up having their coins claimed as stolen property, they'll quickly learn to stay away from Bitcoin laundries and shady exchanges.

"If the conspiracy thing is right the whales are funneling infinite fiat into crypto to keep it down. They're trying to short the market to push the prices down in the hopes that people will sell so that they can buy more. They're actually losing money by doing this and due to bitcoin being a finite resource it is impossible to keep this attack continuously even if they are able to funnel infinite money into it. Fiat can be printed indefinitely, but there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. There's basically a 100% chance that bitcoin will recover.

At some point they will be unable to buy more and they will have to accept their losses. Oddly enough the whales believe in bitcoin a lot more than the rest of us if they're willing to lose so much money in order to acquire most of the available bitcoins.

Bitcoin is a long term investment. It's a deflationary currency. People are buying into it either for long term investment that will give a return in 5-10 years or because they believe that most countries will eventually transition from fiat to bitcoin which is again a long term investment.

You can do three things: buy and wait patiently, buy and instantly spend bitcoin to purchase goods to increase adoption or get out. 

Bitcoin is so volatile it could be worth 1 USD or 18k tomorrow. You have to be ok with the chance of losing everything. This is partly due to adoption being low. I would not use stop losses. You're either in it for the long run or you're out. It sounds like you have a pretty risk averse mentallity. I don't think trading crypto is a good idea for you.

This market is definitely not for regular people. The whales have giant balls, infinite stashes of money and they do not give a shit. All they care about is profit or getting more bitcoin. If they have to shake everyone's faith in bitcoin to buy more at a lower price they will use everything they can to do so...even if it means it might destroy bitcoin in the process. If they end up losing all that money they do not give a shit. I believe this is who you're dealing with.",1522973414

"&gt; Right, they ensure miners are following the expected rules of the users who submit transactions (value/economic power) through them.

Users don't usually go ""through"" validating nodes, nor would they need to. Bitcoin is not some kind of mesh network where nonmining nodes are needed for you to connect to miners. Users can and usually will (and should) connect directly to miners.

&gt; By choosing which network to use, users contribute economic power by way of transferring value on their chain of choice.

End users do hold economic power, as in any market. But that's totally irrespective of irrelevant, non-mining nodes.

&gt; But if the mining power is centralized, the miners are incentivised to cartel/price fix and set the rules of the network.

No, they're not. It's not possible for miners to do this without torpedoing the chain and their own investment.

"Wow, you can literally find the answer to these retarded questions by googling for less than 5 minutes.

- Person A deposits $1000. 
- Person B takes out a loan for $900. 
- Person A needs to take out $1000 to buy a graphics card because he wants to mine crypto and go to the moooooon
- Person A is able to withdraw $1000 because (and this might blow your mind) Person C had deposits at the bank

So yes in essence your withdrawal is coming from Person C's piggy bank.

""B-b-but what if everyone comes to withdraw their money."" 

Yep that's called a ""Run on the Bank."" It's rare but it happens. There's a few ways banks mitigate this risk.

1. They pay for deposit insurance (CDIC in Canada, FDIC in the US)

2. Banks give you interest when you save your money (savings accounts and GICs) which encourage people to leave the deposits with the Bank

3. Banks in North America are some of the the most regulated businesses in the western world - they are highly regulated in order to increase consumer confidence to protect against a ""Run on the Bank""

""B-b-but where does the interest come from? How does the Bank pay the client in that savings account?""

Easy answer, it comes from mortgage interest that other clients are paying.

""B-but what if person B and others don't pay back their loans?""

It happens - look at Bear Sterns. Therefore its in the bank's interest not to give loans out to shitty borrowers. ie people who have bad credit ratings or can't maintain a stable job.

"As long as you enjoy building and maintaining mining machines, it can be viewed as a hobby where you may (or may not) make money on the side.

The only scenario where money will flow into GPU coins (If and when Ethereum switches to POS) is if enough investors believe that GPU coins will rise in price and invests because of that shared belief, but there is no indication that that is the case. The amount that need to flow into the coins to keep GPU profitability stable would be a large portion of the market cap of Ethereum, since the GPUs that are currently tied up in Ethereum will change to the most profitable GPU coin or they will be resold at a discount.

&gt; price of everything I've mined and banked should eventually rise.

This is not necessarily true for any one coin/token, and it is not necessarily true for the market cap for all current cryptos and tokens. And even if it is true that it will rise, it may rise slower over the long term than alternative investments with average returns of 7% per year.

Diversifying your portfolio also means that you have investments in other markets in addition to crypto.

If you’re saying that the logic of an investment decreases with the dollar amount invested then I disagree there too.

Rather than trying to redesign Bitcoin, we should use what resources already exist to make lives better for our users.

"&gt; What does it mean to talk about a nation's demand for currency?

Currency is trade tokens. If you don't have any trade going on you don't need any currency. The more things you are trading the more tokens you need to represent those things, the greater the demand for currency will be.

&gt;If a nations demand for currency goes up over the course of a year, what changed during that year?

Specifically demand for trade of goods and services, abstractly a growing economy will tend to both increase the amount of goods and services available to trade, and the number of people with wealth to trade them.

We refer to gold standard as ""deflationary"", only because the supply of gold tends now to increase slower than the demand for currency, but this was not always the case. There have been several inflationary periods during the gold currency era, both when the economy has tanked and demand for trade in goods and services have dropped (this occurred during the civil war), and also when large new gold deposits were found and there was a sudden increase in gold supply above the present demand (this happened locally during many gold rushes).

"Perhaps this is the reason that the majority of the world still lives under totalitarian government, and all of the world has done for the vast majority of history.I think that no matter what systems we build in order to protect freedom or decentralization, if people are not ready to live in freedom (without authority telling them what to do), psychologically or otherwise, then it will be for nought. For example, the US constitution was written to safeguard the US as a bastion of liberty for centuries to come, and yet most of that liberty was dismantled and what little remains is under threat.

From personal experience I can say that being involved with Bitcoin has taught me a lot and changed my thinking profoundly. I think that 'converting' people to Bitcoin takes more than just setting them up with a wallet and selling them a few coins.",1522968468
"Damn everyone needs to calm down. After reading the article I was like ""oh cool people will be able to withdraw their Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoin Diamond"" then I come here and people are throwing a hissy fit. I get it that this is not the news you were maybe expecting, but it's not like it's bad news or something. It's good that Coinbase is supporting more assets. I've said it before, I always believed Bitcoin Gold would be the next coin they support simply because it is low hanging fruit. The process for getting it setup is probably pretty similar to BCH. Why wouldn't they start off with these easy coins first? And for those complaining that you can't trade these coins, remember that they said the same thing about BCH. I feel like for most commenters here they would have been pissed announcing any coin that they didn't hold. People need to chill. This is a step in the right direction. ",1522968447
"The same could be said for Bitcoin Full Nodes and Bitcoin transactions which are not protected by ""Anonymous"" VPNs...",1522968416
"Well nobody is complaining about not being able to send their forked coins to cold storage.  The sentiment is dumping it for a quick buck because the forks have all been about making a quick buck and haven't added any value to the ecosystem.  Until someone forks Bitcoin and actually does something innovative with it, forks will continue to be seen as money grabs.
",1522968346
"I've been thinking a lot lately about what the properties of a good decentralized reputation system might be. I agree that we need to a way to crowd-source consensus about authority, not just for reddit, or bitcoin, but for the entire digital space. Corey Doctorow came up with Whuffy, and China is implementing it's own state-run reputation system, and I'm familiar with your ideas about liquid democracy you talked about earlier.

Is there a basic set of principles that you think make the foundation that any reputation system requires? What are they? Is there any hope for a merit/utility based reputation system that we can use to delegate authority?

Thanks for the AMA, it's nice to hear your thoughts about what's happened. One last question - given that you don't seem to have much hope for the future of BCH, do you have any suggestions? What should the focus be for people that want to see BCH succeed? Do you want to see BCH (or any other cryptocurrency) succeed?",1522968321

"LN as a decentralized network that can scale is still vapourware right now.

it has no long-term success plan. If it is successful in solving what seems to be an unsolvable decentralized routing problem it'll kill BTC because you won't need to settle on chain. That is pay mining fees to secure the BTC network. ",1522968248

"Often you get some small amount of the money in the beginning to make it look trustworthy, but it isn’t. Most of your money will be gone forever.

People don’t give you money for free. Bitcoin works very differently. You buy it yourself and you hold it yourself. It can go up and it can go down. If it goes up and you sell it, you’ve more money. If it goes down and you sell it you’ve less money. It’s not something other people do for you.",1522968224
"I can't bear to cash out when I had life changing $ back in December that I let ride and now by the time I pay taxes I'd lose money. Crypto is dead to me for awhile. Every time it dips a bit more it hurts even if I wasn't planning on cashing out, now all I can think is that I should have in December. Just deleted my tracking apps and going to try to forget that money ever existed. Maybe this way I can do what I got in saying I was going to do and think long term.... still mining though but at this point I ought to sell those 4 1070's too. ",1522968208

If a coin has high returns and is widely known, it will have investors. I'm not saying this applies to me, but this applies to the majority. This is prevalent among the biggest companies in the world with disgusting CEO's aswell. If the product is good, why should others care about the background of people within the company?",1522968073

I'm sorry, but this is clearly not true. Look at the moderators of this sub and their posts, they all favor BCH. Roger created the sub, are his views ""non-BCH specific""? I've seen people banned for discussing non-BCH forks because the mods deemed them ""scamcoins"", just like r/bitcoin deems BCH a scamcoin.

Look at positive BTC posts in ""new"", they either get ignored or have negative comments and zero votes. This sub is clearly, *clearly* a BCH biased sub. To think otherwise is madness.

"India wanted to make their own crypto, but the project failed... And now they ban all crypto. These h**s ain't loyal.",1522967767
"The aspects that will be the most impacted by eCommerce blockchain technology are: 

**Privacy**
As we all know, tech giants like Google, Apple, Facebook, but also Ebay and Amazon, make a business of collecting and mining our personal data. This represents a huge risk for the user as not only does that data can totally be willingly abused as we've seen in the case of #DeleteFacebook, but it can also be compromised/hacked like the gigantic Equifax data leak. Let's not forget that these companies also sell that information to third-parties who use that data to build an entire profile associated to your identity. In fact, big data companies know you more than you know yourself.

IMO, for privacy to be truly enhanced, the blockchain has to have native privacy tools that preserve its users' privacy. It also needs to be made completely trustless (even escrow), as introducing third-parties always leave the door opened for data mining. For example, escrow agents could log conversations between vendors and buyers, or log the tracking number of a parcel. Also, as tech companies are starting to nail blockchain analysis tools, analyzing marketplaces running on pseudonymous blockchains will become trivial/easy, thus the definitive need to have privacy-focused tools natively built into the blockchain (and preferably, enabled by default).

**Lower costs for vendors**
Giants like Amazon, Ebay, Etsy or Alibaba take a huge cut off each sale or ask for astronomical membership fees (for a more in-depth analysis of their fee structure, you can read my article that I wrote about a year ago about that [here](https://decentralize.today/who-is-going-to-use-particls-decentralized-anonymous-market-and-why-is-it-so-badly-needed-7eb79cc8b9ad) (specifically the ""Much Lower Fees Than Centralized Counterparts"" section).

**Less fees for crypto users**
When you are a full-blown crypto user and want to buy some stuff, you need to cash out back to fiat or use some third-party who will fulfil an order for you. Not only does it add several steps to the purchasing process, but it also adds a considerable amount of fees. 

What is interesting about blockchain marketplaces is that they allow users to purchase and sell items and pay entirely in crypto. This eliminates the superfluous fees and allow people to basically buy or sell anything without ever requiring fiat currencies. 

This is of course awesome for anyone that has an axe to grind with the fiat global system, but it is also a great way for people in countries experiencing hyperinflation (like Venezuela, for example) to opt out of this punitive system and live of the crypto economic system instead. This may seem like a stretch for us people who live comfortably, but for people in countries where the economy is out of control, the ability to opt out of the fiat system is extremely valuable for them. 

**Potential tax optimization**
Now this may be a stretch as well, but there seems to be some countries that don't tax purchases made with cryptocurrencies. Buying stuff directly in cryptocurrency, in those countries, could prove an interesting strategy for people wanting to pay less taxes as they don't need to cash out to fiat anymore (and thus be taxed on that withdrawal). This is of course something that would preferably need to be investigated more but it does open door for that kind of activity, especially if the marketplace has built-in privacy features. 

**More engaging ecosystem for users**
As we are already aware, coins and blockchains do generate communities around them. These people get very dedicated and want to contribute to the project. This community aspect is something that is missing (or at least, is not as pronounced) to giants like Amazon or Ebay, and I believe that the kind of excitement blockchain projects generate would be highly beneficial to the success of a marketplace. This basically makes the shopping experience much more friendly and, especially if the marketplace has some kind of reward program, incentivizes people to come back to it. 

---

So for the reasons mentioned above, I am really a big Particl fan. It is a blockchain project that is building an entire decentralized economy and its first application is a decentralized, private by default marketplace governed by the community and which has absolutely no third-party. It will (it is still in development, Alpha in a few days) accept almost any coin compatible with Atomic Swaps, and is in my opinion the ultimate decentralized marketplace solution being proposed in the cryptocurrency scene right now! 

A video you would find quite helpful for your article would be this video interview from Tai Zen where Joe Fisher, one of our advisor that has made a career out of inventing products and selling them online, explains in great details why decentralized marketplaces will change the industry. His perspective is very interesting (especially as he explains how Amazon rips off vendors by analyzing their sales data and stealing the best selling ""new"" products) and one that is quite frankly eye-opening (at least it was for me). There are two parts to this interview and you can watch it [here for part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAhZK6AnPLw) and [here for part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlAL3x2HHFY)

"Not sure if the work is complete yet, but  yes they're implementing RingCT on Bitcoin coinbase.",1522967734
Originally that's what I had but I changed it to bitcoin.,1522967708
"Yeah totally. So just to clarify though, fiat currency is not the same as fractional reserve banking. There are some ways they're connected but fundamentally they're very different concepts. Bitcoin in and of itself is also not a monetary policy. Nor is fiat currency. A monetary policy can include specific details regarding fiat or crypto currency. The currency itself is not the monetary policy. 

Let's just use one specific micro economic example. You are a inventor and you have a cool widget you want to manufacture. Your widget costs $1 to make, you can make 5,000 per month and you sell them for $5 each. So you have gross profit of $20,000 per month. Not bad.

I am a small startup bank. I have $5m in cash but I've also made $15m in loans. I have enough debt service (ie monthly payments of principal plus interest from the people I've loaned money to) to cover my costs and keep at least $5m in cash reserves at any given time. 

You come to me and say you need a $100,000 loan. Even though I have $15m in loans outstanding to my $5m cash reserves (in other words, if all of my customers went bankrupt and defaulted at the same time today, I would have a loss of $10m and could possibly become insolvent and have to declare bankruptcy myself), I'm willing to give you the $100,000 because your business has gross margins of 500% so I can charge you interest of 9% over 36 months and you'll still have enough gross margin to cover overhead costs, pay yourself and not go out of business. Your business will have the cash flow to be able to pay me back at 9% and remain solvent, so I'm willing to offer you credit even though I'm already leveraged beyond my actual cash reserves. 

That's basically fractional reserve banking. By the way, this type of arrangement could be made via crypto as well. In fact, smart contacts are very likely to be a massive emerging market for credit lenders. Insurance companies would jump all over being able to write a code that would prevent their client (the bank) from incurring significant losses due to their customers (homeowners, business owners, etc) defaulting, if there can be certain programming language written into a loan agreement such that the risk of defaulting is mitigated significantly and the risk of incurring significant losses in the case of default is also mitigated due to the triggering of certain automated actions.",1522967661
"&gt; You may be right but at the time XT was programmed to do nothing until, iirc, 75% of hash power was voting for the change. And then there was a grace period before the hard fork happened. So a miner switching to XT would not have risked losing any money. 

Would you recommend a similar system for governing Bitcoin Cash upgrades? It seems that most people in the Bitcoin Cash community don't care about signalling any more, perhaps because of the SegWit2x failure despite overwhelming positive signalling.",1522967639
No it won’t. What it will do is if a fork happens Coinbase users can kill that chain. It’s a good thing. Forked coins gives you more bitcoin. ,1522967633

Could you list some examples? If it ""happens a lot"", you must be able to list some of them, right?

Also, corporate environments don't generally use MIT licenses and put their code on github, where anyone can fork the code and make changes. If core and LN is so bad, why hasn't someone forked the code?

Turns out they already did, and the result is BCH. This begs the question, why after 8 months has BCH not overtaken BTC if it is so obviously superior and the majority of the community wants it?

"&gt;True on the BTC fork. And that mainly why it is a departure for the original design.

Which version of the reference client do you regard as ""the original""?

V0.1 created by Satoshi?

V0.3.19 when Satoshi himself was still chief and main developer?

V0.14.0 the version BCH modified to create the hard fork?

&gt;A node can’t detect a soft fork by design

Of course they can be *detected*. They are designed to not violate older, earlier, ""original"" rules - thus blocks with the new rules are ""valid"". This makes them backwards compatible because they do not break consensus. If the soft fork you described were implemented it is then up to the soft forking nodes to try and reach a clear majority and and reach a certain percent of the network hash rate usually by a certain block number. Otherwise, the soft fork will fail and the original chain will simply carry on unchanged.   

&gt;If you ignore the longest chain you are HF away and breaking consensus too.

If you ignore the longest **valid** chain you are breaking consensus. BCH has a longer chain/more blocks because it *changed* it's difficulty adjustment algorithm *from the original*. Such a change rendered its blocks invalid on the original chain.  

&gt;Big blocks are the original design. 

Big block were, and are, an attack vector. Satoshi fixed that error himself and many other flaws have also been fixed since V0.1

Only BCH bag holders believe that because that's what they were told by the people scamming them.

Hence why Verge market cap is so high: their crypto is dog shit but people don’t know it — they lack that information.",1522966868
"How old is fiat currency? How old are credit cards? How long has man placed value in precious metals? How long has man needed a way to exchange one thing of value for another?

11: More Crypto,1522966811
"As much as I would love to give everyone a history lesson and a round up about technology, the reason for bitcoin and blockchain, it simply isn't worth the risk. I know a guy who made a huge thread on bitcointalk about something similar, even with evidence and since then the thread has been deleted and the user has been banned. The 'report' was the user simply had some personal issues and regrets what he said. 

Money is the fuel and the main currency on earth, with enough money there is next to nothing that you cannot do. Personal issues doesn't appear weeks after a post, at least not the type where you regret what has been said showing valid evidence behind the claim. 

No individual can actually give what is happening and why it is happening negative feedback. One man's voice, against the money, a lot of individuals still believe the banks operate legit, they also believe Donald Trump was ellected president legally. They also believe Facebook didn't share or sell their personal information, same with Google. But you know what?

Personally, I hope one day there will be someone who can ensure his voice will be heard that actually has the guts to disclose whats going on. But until then, never believe in the media, do your own research and don't 'invest' blindly, the 'ICO' economy is probably going to have it's own 'Wolf of Walstreet' movie coming out soon, because IPO scams have been around forever, but this is the next level. But to take it even further, those who do these things, they create or buy exchanges and I believe the sentence 'manipulation hasn't even begun to the extent it'll come to yet'

This extends to numerous new sites (Cointelegraph, Coindesk) and even into multiple forums all controlled by the same people.

None of this touches on the fact that there are people dedicated to shaping the narrative any way they can, including sockpuppet accounts, bot voting, account hacking, and loads of misinformation.

"It can be difficult, but the easiest way to handle it is if you feel you're starting to make emotional decisions, walk away. On the poker side it's  called tilt - and nothing will make it easier to take money from people than if you put them on tilt.  Same applies here - when you lose that logic-based perspective you'll probably end up making a mistake which will only cause you to spiral harder.  Cash out into btc/etc/usd/whatever and kick back for a while until you're stable again.  It can be trying, but when you recognize the signs and can act on them it's worth it 100%.

&gt; much of the community likes to see this as an investment, and while it is in some ways (perhaps long term), there is an element of emotion and passion that I see with almost every coin.

I think it's a general lack of perspective and tech knowledge as well. Where does the project fit in when it comes to the big picture? Why would it be in a good position? It goes beyond just dreamy sounding white papers... and requires an understanding of the problem the project is trying to solve, use cases, potential partners/users and the surrounding politics.  Combine a lack of thorough research and emotional reasoning?  Yep, you're right.  It's a recipe for disaster.

&gt; where do you see BTC in the near and mid-term?

I'm honestly not sure.  I think there are good arguments for the correction continuing for a bit, and there's always a possibility the remainder of the MtGox funds being dumped which would make that worse.  Honestly though I focus more on same-day trades, and a few long term alts focusing on specific use cases (rather than being a currency).  With the first I'm mostly just looking for patterns that can be exploited (sometimes bots), and news that might cause a rise in price.  I've only really followed LTC in the short term as well - I mostly bought it for arbitrage opportunities, or to transfer from one exchange to another (usually taking advantage of the price differences at the same time).  

Now long term... I think it'll hit a wall and people will move on to a successor.  It may be growing in value like crazy now (well, over the last few years), but I don't think that growth will be sustainable to anywhere near where a lot of people are speculating.  It's not popular, but I think the idea that it will always increase in value will kill it.  BTC needs adoption to be anything more than an investment vehicle.  For adoption, people need to want to spend it... but not many people getting into BTC are doing so because they want to use it as a currency - it's to get the gains.  Why spend $100 worth now if that could be $1000 in a year?  So if people don't spend it, businesses that decide to take it will likely decide it's not worth the time/money involved in dealing with it.  

If you've got a ton to throw at it before then... I think it'll still recover and possibly surpass where it hit turn of the year.  If you aren't dumping huge sums into it I think that you can make more off the stuff that's less valuable at the moment.  It's a bigger risk... but nobody's going to make a lot of money off a sure thing unless you've already got a ton to throw around.  Same really goes for LTC and ETH I think as well.  You've got the same potential from .01 to 1.0 as 1.0 to 100, but it will be a **lot** easier to accomplish.  100 to 1000 (LTC) is going to be the same as 0.01 to 0.1 or 1.0 to 10.0, but it will take much longer than either.

Just something to think about if you're looking at long term - though that's where the risk management and logical trading is critical.  Go low enough and single digit price differences could end up being 10% or more - so if it starts dropping and you aren't positive it will come back up...",1522965877

Any new commodity that one can sell for more than one can produce is of interest to a capitalist. Blockchain has properties that will make it useful to humans and it will evolve differently when it is not just a means to produce a commodity. It could be used as a form of money for a government if tailored to its needs.

Cryptocurrency is not doomed, but crypto-commodities trying to pose as equivalent to government money may be a short lived fad. It's going to end up in the public sector one day where it serves collective interests for our centralized system of management of things.

Your view is like Hayek's old view. It says that we can not possibly manage complexity because it has too many variables that are interrelated and unknown to us. That turns out to be wrong. The sciences to describe and model complexity came after he did, and it would have made him look foolish if he had lived to see it. The same science that serves engineers and climatologists serves to model and understand any dynamic system of variables. It's not that we cannot possibly do it, it's that it requires the understanding to know that we can be guided by it, and to put the tools in the hands of well intentioned leaders not for sale to the highest bidder. The vast majority of voting folks are dullards, and that is certainly problematic. You can win them over with simplistic causal relationships like: your pain is due to the ""other"".

You view is a view that is shared by some in the social sciences, though. Social historians like Morris Berman are convinced we are in societal decline and that it is just a matter of time before we collapse and have to remake ourselves. The argument for this is that it has been a great constant in History. He envisions people living in decentralized monastic type arrangements where stability is more modular and where progressive ideas can be stored for when they may be useful later--a sort of renaissance.

Capitalism has been bad in the sense that it has made many things unsustainable possible in a short period of time. We only oscillate politically at a much slower pace, allowing very slow determination of what political direction we ought to pursue, if we ever come to it. At to that the fact that our adult lives are comparatively short and you get a desire for solutions that maximize benefit now for some who are at the prime of their lives. If we were immortal it would matter more to us that we develop sustainability in the biosphere, but as it is the individual is very much interested only in his lifetime.

A recipe to maintain complexity is to spend more in its maintenance. The day we start pulling the plug on the effort is the day it starts to unravel. The anti-government crowd are of no use to anyone in that regard. They are more intent on bringing on the decline that we are not necessarily facing yet. We can point the main issues and we can sped to address them, but it has to be an honest effort. It cannot just be about a profit motive.

It really is still up in the air what happens to us, although it looks like our environmental impacts will force our hand in time. Whether we act proactively or not will not change that will one day have to act. That ought to at least get us realizing that action is not forever delayed. If people do not want to pay the increasing price of complexity they will not benefit from it and a crueler version of what we have gone through will repeat itself to the degree that there more of us with access to less.

- Be able to market itself in a way that doesn’t make it look shady.

I believe that it will also legitimize the field in a way that would be difficult to do otherwise.  Why would banks ban crypto transactions if they're completely legitimate?  Why would platforms like Google ban ads for Bitcoin services?  Banning fraud is one thing, absolutely.  But the good businesses should be able to advertise on Google if they want to.

"I am pretty sure I understand this, but I am happy to learn. Let´s do it with an example. Let´s say the Bitcoin network consists of:

(a) 10 miners, every miner runs a miner-node
(b) 1000 Rasberry-Pi nodes run by bitcoin users in their basement

Now the 10 miner nodes run on super fast hardware and are all heavily interconnected - because the second a miner finds a block, he wants to be sure he has the latest version of the mempool with all potential transactions - because he wants to put the most profitable ones in the block. He will validate the transactions by himself before he puts them into the block. 

Now, what are the 1000 Rasberry-Pi-nodes exactly doing for the network? The only thing they do is they send the transactions to the miner-nodes. That´s it. 

If your Rasberry-Pi-node validates your outgoing transaction - that´s great, but if the miner-nodes decide that your transaction is invalid, it will never get into a block. And if your node tells you that you will receive a transaction, but no miner-node will ever put it into a block - you will not receive it, believe me ;)

So the 1000 Rasberry-Pi-nodes can validate transactions until the cows come home, it simply doesn´t matter. And if 6 out of 10 miners collude and make a 51%-attack.... well then it is game over anyway, your Rasberry-Pi-node will not stop them.

I can´t think of a situation where a normal user has a big advantage running a node (if you are a merchant with a lot of incoming transactions it might make sense to run a node (but on faster hardware than a Rasberry-PI and on faster internet connection than a standard home DSL, there also might be some small advantages). 

But the whole argument ""everybody and his brother needs to run its own node on $50 hardware and therefore the blockchain needs to be small"" is simply nonsense.

That´s how I understand it. Where I am wrong?

The ""Core"" philosophy of not raising it until we absolutely have to is self defeating that way.

We would use a service like Waves to create the currency, then we would hold an ICO.  The idea is that by the end of our implementation we will have setup a structure that makes money.  This money is then used to back the coins that we initially sold.  So, you can trade the coins in to us for USD.  This would allow for the initial investors to make their money back.

Have you seen this:

It is nick's take on Pseudonyms and how he has used them before and what to consider when making one. This adds to your theory that he would deliberately add red hearings for example the British English and newspaper article.

Something to consider very closely with this, which adds even more weight to SN being Nick, is that he discusses in this post not having much contact with your Pseudonym e.g. mail to and from your real identity. This could explain why Bitgold was deliberately left out of the bitcoin whitepaper. Bitgold was by far the closest thing to bitcoin at the time and you would surely think that SN would reference it as some ideas where directly lifted from SN blog posts. This for me is very strong evidence.

I know the coding of bitcoin was not traditional. Maybe SN was partly self-taught? For me the biggest barrier to believe Nick was SN is the coding. The coding was genius if unconventional. A lot of the small details in Bitcoin are only noticeable for their genius once you go through the code. I also seem to remember SN trying to explain a principle and was having difficulty to do it in words but had no difficulty in coding. I will see if I can find this post again. As we know Nick has a law background and he is very fluent in explaining hard concepts in English.

You are correct though, if they are separate people they are both geniuses. Both have had world changing ideas.

It would be interesting to find out where Nick was during this time and what his job was. I think that would add a lot of support or to the Theory if it matches up with what we know about SN.

A few months ago, there was a bot voting attack on Reddit Bitcoin subs.  Lots of bitcoin redditors hacked and their accounts gave upvotes and downvotes they never did themselves.  /r/Bitcoin moderators blamed /r/btc immediately and pointed to it as proof of supposed bot manipulation that goes on ""constantly"".  This post lays out [convincing evidence that the attack was a false flag](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7eil12/evidence_that_the_mods_of_rbitcoin_may_have_been/) from /r/Bitcoin mods themselves, or at least from Core supporters well connected with them.

Thieflar is an /r/Bitcoin mod.  He's one of the worst, and frequently trolls over here (and elsewhere).  He also ""debunks"" everything that goes against the /r/Bitcoin desired narrative.  He gave a ""debunking"" with the above post.

The debunking started out by claiming something that the OP didn't even state was false, and then twisting his words to make it seem like that applies that to the premise of the entire post.  His statements were on the face true, but clearly deceptive as that isn't what the OP claimed nor did it address the premise of the OP's evidence.  This kind of deceptive behavior is typical for thieflar.  This link is him being called out on the deception, doubling down on the deception, and then trying to weasel out of it when caught.

I was wrong an all accounts. And what surprised me is gold and silver did nothing. It didn't dip when I thought, didn't rise when I thought. Just stayed there and continues this trend.

"Your poker experience is fascinating!  And I am definitely working on learning to trade dispassionately, setting firm entry and exit points.  That was my biggest mistake the first go round in Dec/Jan: prices just kept going up, and I kept HODLing, thinking we were in a ""new"" normal.  Pure stupidity.  I think this is why algorithmic bots are now the preferred mechanism on Wall Street and by whales in crypto space: computers have no feelings.  They don't care about the ""technology"", the size of Reddit subs, or shilling.  They look purely at the numbers, support and resistance levels, and trade accordingly.

Come to think of it, I think this is why so many are getting fleeced inc crypto now: much of the community likes to see this as an investment, and while it is in some ways (perhaps long term), there is an element of emotion and passion that I see with almost every coin.  How many times do you visit a sub-Reddit and hear, ""I LOVE this coin!"" or ""I'm a big believer in this coin!""  Pfft.  I now believe in nothing except the numbers.  Belief and loyalty in particular coins is what sank my portfolio.  Belief and loyalty have no place in investing.  It might work for VERY long term plays, but IMO this space is far too new to invest long-term.  Huge gamble.

"**Great Filter**

The Great Filter, in the context of the Fermi paradox, is whatever prevents ""dead matter"" from giving rise, in time, to ""expanding lasting life"". The concept originates in Robin Hanson's argument that the failure to find any extraterrestrial civilizations in the observable universe implies the possibility something is wrong with one or more of the arguments from various scientific disciplines that the appearance of advanced intelligent life is probable; this observation is conceptualized in terms of a ""Great Filter"" which acts to reduce the great number of sites where intelligent life might arise to the tiny number of intelligent species with advanced civilizations actually observed (currently just one: human). This probability threshold, which could lie behind us (in our past) or in front of us (in our future), might work as a barrier to the evolution of intelligent life, or as a high probability of self-destruction. The main counter-intuitive conclusion of this observation is that the easier it was for life to evolve to our stage, the bleaker our future chances probably are.

"So your argument is that Bitcoin is unfair. I am asking... *again*... what action do you want to take to fix the issues?

You could:

* make it better 
* convince people to stop using it
* make it illegal

I have thought and thought about these problems. Take a look at this (almost certainly fictional, but chilling) account of the future we face: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1lfobc/i_am_a_timetraveler_from_the_future_here_to_beg


What can we do to stop that from happening? Humans are not altruistic, nor are we proactive. The current system's imperfections are an expression of that.

Cryptography and cryptocurrency are Pandora's Boxes. They can't be uninvented.

My view, and you won't like it, is that we won't, and shouldn't attempt to, solve these problems. They are provably unsolvable without  discarding our humanity in the process. I would rather die human and suffering than lose my liberties or have my tendencies forcefully modified.

Our best chance is to allow the period of instability and chaos to happen naturally, which will in the process destroy the technology that enables Bitcoin to work. Hopefully we will survive the downfall but eventually the human race will come to an end. This has all happened before, and it will all happen again.

As for me, I'm not selling my rig simply because no one wants to give me what it is worth to me. I'm not going to sell it at cost because I put time and effort into the build as well as the fact that it still brings in cryptocurrency; relative profitability is thought of in terms of trade pairs, but if I plan to HODL anyway, the price of everything I've mined and banked should eventually rise. So thinking of profitability in terms of relative trade pair values at any given time is kind of the wrong way to see things.

Makes no sense and is just words you have put down to try and make your point have value and support the narrative that users must bow down and trust others with their money.

As I said - the removal of trust is mentioned 14 times in the white paper - how do you marry that with what you have said? I thought this sub was all about Satoshi's vision no? Or do you ignore bits that don't suit what is being pushed down from on high? ('mining nodes are the only ones that matter').

Cental banks maybe more so when they give interest free cash infusions, or stimulous to retail and investment banks. Maybe that's what it's going for? But those aren't loans and banks that do make loans are generally not central banks so either way it's either flat out wrong or misleading and poorly worded. Not to mention that the basic creation of money isn't really the problem, it's more having a centralized authority who can manipulate the supply and value of said money. A bank making a loan does not increase or decrease the supply of money. They have some money and they give some of it to you and in return you have to pay them back with more money, which you'll earn some other way.

One option is to scale using protocol layers - popular in other such network designs. That retains decentralisation. The other option is to accept much less decentralisation and rely on super nodes. We clearly have different opinions on where the value in Bitcoin comes from. I value not having a central body in control of things and it sounds like you might value cheap forever transactions even at the risk of a central authority changing something in the protocol you might not agree with - I suspect. Fair enough.

"From an Austrian perspective, ""utility"" and ""value"" are not objective qualities that one should calculate or that should give measurable absolute values, but subjective considerations of each individual who makes economic calculations.

Jesús Huerta de Soto, a Spanish economic theorist, comments in his book ""*Socialism, economic calculation and entreprenerurship*"" [*] on this subject that value and utility are almost synonymous, and that they are degrees of importance that we give to our objetives and means. 

With this in mind, one may intuit that some individuals see a utility in bch, which is to function as money and a means to economic and political liberation, while others may see it as a means to obtain low-risk profit, and third parties may see it only as an intermediary between two fiat currencies (to bring purchasing value to their family in an exchange-controlled country), and all of them are truly part of *bitcoin cash's utility*, even though it is, in essence, primarily a medium of exchange.

Roger Ver is an excellent salesman and a lot of people fall for his arguments whilst the majority of people (at least that I know) don’t. 

The vast majority of the holders and buyers speculate in BTC, and a vast majority of them also speculate in it becoming a true store of value. The potential for it to achieve that status is probable, but not guaranteed. If the price of a single BTC is 50K and pretty stable in 2030, people will not be interested in spending it to buy coffee or a t shirt. You have to acknowledge that.

And nothing is perfect, satoshi maybe didn’t foresee this success and Rogers keeps repeating his vision. If the people owning it use it for holding, hedge against inflation, buying a house etc - that doesn’t cohere with the vision, and so be it.

"&gt;Ant-n, I [...] want to guess how many people actually debated back with actual sources?

Well as I said in the previous comment you are debating on Reddit.. not a good forum to understand what anarchy is.

Some friedman video are good (though he is not an anarchist he expalin very well the role of free market)

&gt;Through a series of years, I could only count them on one hand. 

I would point out that you are also quick to dimiss evidence.

Like the millions of deaths people under communist/socialist regime.

Such extraordinary evidence should suggest communism/socialism is broken too. It IMO it start with the claim every should be equal.. which is a call for violence.


&gt;&amp;gt; I would add that socialism has no proven to be sustainable either.. even moderate form of socialism lead countries to have chronic deficit, meaning one generation pay its privileges/benefits by leaving immense debt to the next generation.

&gt;Here, as well as all throughout your comments it seems you believe the world is divided between ""Socialism"", and ""anarchism""; when in reality the opposite of ""anarchism"" is ""Statism"", and not really ""socialism"". 

Socialism is a form of statism.

How any from of socialism can exist with any form of strong state?

The strong the socialism is (toward communist/marxiste state) the larger and stronger the state.

I would be curious to know a counter example.

&gt;At any rate, there aren't any truly socialist states in the world right now, and there have never been. This coupled with the fact that you seem to attempt to ""defeat"" socialism by assuming that's something I'm proposing, and I'm simply not. But to humour you...

&gt;Frankly, citing communist Cuba or Venezuela, or the USSR which I assume are what you refer to when you mean ""socialism"" (in its pure form), is a bit of a disservice to your argument, because I don't think any historian right now actually considers any of those actually ""socialist"", in a Marxist way, states. They are/were ideologically-justified dictatorships and totalitarian states, that have had little to do with their economic system beyond what flavour of propaganda they chose to control the masses. 

This is all fine but beside the semantics, ok I am misslabelling political system but they all share the view that equality should be persue and it is IMO the root of the problem.

But more importantly, your are not reply to my point?

« Running socialist politicies on a deficit is immoral becomes it put the (huge) cost on following generations (debt and/or inflation) »

It is often that people who defend socialism/communism do it for moral reasons. I think this is wrong on so many levels.

A unfair system where peoples have opportunities is vastly superior to a system were everybody is equally poor.

&gt;Secondly, and even if we were to take your example to heart, I[...] I will absolutely argue that equality is absolutely essential in terms of minimising as much as possible the suffering for human kind. 

The cost of those government programs are immense and crippled france economy for years.. the cost hiring people is huge in France and prevent many to find jobs.. nothing is free. 

And the cost compound every years until the system breaks then the final price get paid.

It is also a mistake to think all french people benefits form those government programs, I personally didn’t benefit from them. It is maybe why I have work now.

Regarding equality I disagree deeply, again referring to history. Politic system aiming to bring equallity have been responsible for millions of deaths.

What matters is equality of *opportunities* and.. opportunities. Something that free market provide.

It doesn’t matter that some get rich as long as peoples have opportunities.

Government programs increase the cost of hiring, reducing job opportunities.. nothing is for free.

&gt;Which brings me to my next point regarding your citing the ""fairness of the free market"": It absolutely, unmistakenly, and evidently, **is not so**. A truly free market tends towards oligopolies and progressive concentration of wealth, passing through the mechanisms of regulatory  capture, amongst others. As I said this is unquestionable in all the breath of economic literature, as it's painfully obvious in the world around you, which makes me seriously wonder why you can't see it. 

I don’t think I have argued that market are fair, they are not.

I argued that’s not a problem.

&gt;Which market has better internet access offerings, the American or the European one? Which one is more regulated?

I don’t know for the US but typically countries with more competition got better cheaper internet.

I don’t know why the market competition don’t work in the US but in France mobile phone cost dropped dramatically when competition was allowed to jump in by freeing more frequencies.. 

so the french governments was creating a situation of monopoly by not allow new players



&gt;And so on and so forth. I'm absolutely willing to debate this based on evidence, but as I said, I'm a bit dismayed at the notion that we disagree on such fundamentally obvious matters. A free market is not fair.

Market are not fair, why should they be?

What matters is wealth of people increase (rich and poor).

&gt;Yes, bitcoin is a well-designed system, and therein lies its genius; but just to cite that as some supporting argument for anarchy is a bit disingenuous, unless you explain exactly how those ""incentives"" will be laid out so as to favour constructive behaviours. 

Well it is generally very simple, remove all counterproductive laws, subsidies.. etc (for a start).

Market incentives are already effective in most case (some would argue all) to ensure honest behavior.

&gt;Bitcoin is a payment system, anarchy is a proposal for a whole political system. There is no ""mining blocks"" equivalent for society at large. Let me explain:

No but lossing/gaining money are strong incentives. The market already self regulate.

&gt;&amp;gt; The solutions is to don’t create bad incentives with naive law (even though they come from good intent they can be counterproductive)

&gt;OK, cool; I actually agree here, as do many countries that we should consider amongst the most socialist. Marijuana is legan in the Netherlands for quite a while now; 

Yes and canabis comsumtion is **less** than in France (which has some of the strong law against canabis in EU)

Showing are « naive/moralist » law are so incredibly counterproductive.

&gt;it has nothing to do with the economic system (you're creating a false dichotomy and a straw man argument in one). 

Not sure what you are saying here, absolutely forbidding drug has strong economics consequences as it make trafficking drug extremely profitable.

&gt;But just saying ""not forbidding drugs creates the right incentives"", is far, far, far from a comprehensive incentives mechanism that disfavours psychopathic behaviours. 

It is you that make strowman here, why you bring back phycopatic behavior?

&gt;How does not forbidding drugs make my neighbour not wish to raid my house in search of all the gold he knows I have? 

Again strowman.

Financing huge mafia is much more likely to put you in danger than a potential phycopathic neighbor.

When prohibition ended in the US, criminality went down not up. (Comsumption went down too)

Portugal depenalise drug consumption and death by overdose is one of the lowest in EU.

Those are evidences.

&gt;It all feels like handwaving and blind trust in very, very vague notions to me, and to date, nobody has been able to lay down exactly what these fantastically utopic policies would be, and who would possibly enforce them. 

As you say above it is a scale, but going toward more freedom is the solution (how unintuitive as it sound).

If I could the first I would do is legalize all drug consumption/and production as I found incredible to lock (young) peoples away for years, and all the people directly suffering from the consequences of the traffic. (And the boss get immensely rich..)

This would be the single most impactful law to change IMO.

"You’re focusing on the wrong part of my reply. I haven’t done the research into other value ecosystems and their decentralisation to substantiate the claim that they’re more decentralised. My point is that I would be surprised if this was the best example of decentralisation in this space, because it’s actually very centralised, as I have proven with evidence multiple times. 

The articles I’ve linked both discuss in detail why the current state of centralisation is definitely not good for bitcoin, and it’s been that way for years with no signs of those big players shrinking below about 3-4 of them controlling 51% of the hashrate. Which is why I say that your argument that ‘people have the option to move so it’s not a problem’ is flawed because ‘people’ haven’t done so enough. 

To the average miner, anything over one entity controlling 51% is not considered a direct threat, even though it should be for the reasons outlined in the above articles. Bitcoin is pretty much as centralised as they come when you also consider that 81% of the hashrate is provided by China, what if the Chinese government issued a takeover of the miners there? Then they’d have control of the whole Bitcoin ecosystem.

&gt;&gt;When we first began looking at the massive downvoting attack as shown in BashCo's previously stickied thread last week, the first thing we noticed was that both of the bot-voted comments ( [Image of #1](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cyj7o/-/dpto887/?depth=1), [link to #2](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cyj7o/i_just_got_257_downvotes_in_8_minutes_for_calling/dptpngb/?depth=1), ) would normally trigger our censorship notifier detection. Both ""censoring"" and ""censorship"" are trigger words we have found triggering automatic removal, something we later confirmed again. This would imply that either the comments were explicitly approved by the moderators at that time, or our understanding of the subreddit's policies needed updating.

&gt;Actually, both /u/4n4n4 and /u/StopAndDecrypt have been approved submitters to /r/Bitcoin for 5 months or more. So no, neither comment needed to be manually approved by the moderators, and in fact, as a moderator of /r/Bitcoin, I can say for a fact that neither comment was manually approved by a moderator of /r/Bitcoin. This is a fact.

You deliberately mislead people with your wording, and there's no amount of twisting that can make you look like you aren't a shady fraud. This isn't even unusual for you, it just happens to be a really solid example because it was so blatant and easy enough for someone to miss if they weren't paying close attention.

Again, the satire needs to be *subtle* in order to be any good. When it's this obvious, it isn't even funny.

In any case, it's been extremely amusing, but all good things must come to an end, and I highly doubt you're going to be able to top your own ""pretend like links don't exist in the OP that was quoted directly your response"" episode, so I think it's time for me to call it a night and bid you adieu.

2)It is conveniently  transportable (even wearable) compared to land, grain, livestock etc
3)It's highly divisible, you can cut coins in half, melt bars and remake the sizes and weights you want etc
4)It has a limited supply and is rare enough that people cannot just get it for free (like sea shells) 
5)It has artistic and industrial uses
6)Not location specifc (such as seeds or land)

"**Robbery**

Robbery is the crime of taking or attempting to take anything of value by force, threat of force, or by putting the victim in fear. According to common law, robbery is defined as taking the property of another, with the intent to permanently deprive the person of that property, by means of force or fear; that is, it is a larceny or theft accomplished by an assault. Precise definitions of the offence may vary between jurisdictions. Robbery is differentiated from other forms of theft (such as burglary, shoplifting, or car theft) by its inherently violent nature (a violent crime); whereas many lesser forms of theft are punished as misdemeanors, robbery is always a felony in jurisdictions that distinguish between the two.

"&gt; but overall they have a mean average of 10 minutes.

Mean and average are 2 different things. It's important to be precise, but what you mean when you talk about the real blockchain, is ""average"".

&gt;  Now, does that change the average time towards the blocks from random points? Or is it still 5 minutes?

The problem with this change is that it makes all the difference in the world, and **i think** I see where's the disconnect. The problem is in your definition of ""random points"". In a regular blockchain (ie: blocks at **exactly** 10 minutes apart), the definition of ""random points"" is a non-issue from a statistical standpoint. When translating that to the real blockchain (random distribution with an average of 10m), if we use the same definition for ""random points"" (ie: seeing the blockchain as a drawn straight line, and taking a pencil and marking random points along the way), then **yes, the average time from randomply-chosen points, towards the next, and the previous block, would be 5 minutes each way**.

So I see where you're getting confused regarding what we know about the experiment from the bet between Craig and Peter. And it goes to the heart of what ""memorylessness"" means. I think you're thinking ""but redlightsaber, how the fuck can it be 5 minutes forwards, if the experiment said that the expected time towards the next block would be 10 minutes?"".

And you'd be right. But I'll tell you where the confusion is. It's in the definition of ""random points"". In your thought experiment, we're taking literal random points all along the blockchain, without any kind of regularity or pattern. In the [experiment that ultimately settled the bet between peter and craig](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6q2uak/peter_rizun_and_craig_wright_just_bet_1_btc_on_a/dku6pp8/), ""random points"" weren't such, they are a subset of intervals in the blockchain, wherein the ""points"" were not really ""random"", but more like ""statistically regularly random"". He chose, for instance, **all intervals where blocks had not been found by 7.5m**, *so he discarded all the intervals between blocks that were &lt; 7.5m*.

"I have actually been documenting most type of comments that appear here. A lot of them extol the possible utility of Bitcoin as if that has great value now. What is not so often seen are arguments why anyone ought to not be paying just a bit more than the average cost of labor time to produce them. Every premium above that which is paid has to be based in the belief of a utility value out there that justifies paying more. I don't see it. It's simply not there yet, if it will ever be there. The point most often made is that it will be there at some point and that it will be beneficial to pay a premium for something that is simply rare or in limited supply and of a utility that does not bring with in a means to profit to make up the difference. It's a 100 percent losing proposition to me. I get that it could be nice to trade this way, but who will be irresponsible enough to pay more than what it returns to him in utility? That is a vote for the continued ignorance of the market. I do not think it can stand. Lots of people call me a hater, but I would have to be presented with a very strong argument to ever pay more for something (in my own labor) than it costs to produce. It would only be of interest to me if there was actually a way to profit from it that isn't about finding a bigger sucker. A shovel has some utility that I could potentially exploit to, but it is not smart to pay $2000 for one. I think crypto currencies will be common and that some will eventually show up backed by governments, not fluctuating in value  and with very strong utility propositions.

None of this wallet private/public key complication, none of the jargon, none of the investment risk - just adopted tech that works.

There's also the cases where the moderators remove every comment that paints core developers(Who happen to support /r/Bitcoin's desired outcomes, unsurprisingly) in a bad light, even truthfully, and also auto-removes all replies to the core developers' comments.

The reality is, you know all this.  And while you might think some of it is right and/or justifiable, just like all religious fanatics do, you also know on some level that a lot of this is just plain wrong and immoral.  You're ashamed of it.  You're also upset that despite all the attempts to control everything, /r/btc keeps getting more popular and getting more and more users.

"&gt;Right, so not the two comments referred to in the entirety of the OP. You were referring to two other comments entirely eh? Including a comment the OP never asserted was blocked / approved at all?

Go back and read what I just provided to you (hint: I included a quote **from the OP**, where they link directly to 4n4n4's and StopAndDecrypt's comments). 

&gt;And then you totally didn't switch it back to the actual two comments the OP was discussing in the next sentence:

That's correct, I didn't ""switch"" anything. 

#From the OP:

&gt;When we first began looking at the massive downvoting attack as shown in BashCo's previously stickied thread last week, the first thing we noticed was that both of the bot-voted comments ( **[Image of #1](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cyj7o/-/dpto887/?depth=1), [link to #2](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cyj7o/i_just_got_257_downvotes_in_8_minutes_for_calling/dptpngb/?depth=1)** ) would normally trigger our censorship notifier detection.

Click those links. They lead directly to the two comments being discussed. Go look at the original post, and notice that the links are included in the OP. Feel the embarrassment wash over you.

&gt;You see, I'm not stupid.

Slow down there! Let's not go *that* far...

&gt; I knew exactly what you did there, I knew it the first moment I read it. The OP was referring to two specific comments by 4n4n4 and Darwin2500, and asserted that 4n4n4 was not manually approved but Darwin2500's comment was. You twisted your statement to imply that 4n4n4's comment wasn't manually approved (which was never claimed in the first place) and then also that StopAndDecrypt's comment wasn't manually approved (which was also never claimed).

Or, you could go back and **try reading things a little more closely**, like [I *just* suggested](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89mcjd/my_csw_rant/dwv58p5/), and feel yourself succumb to the realization that you're (yet again) three steps behind, confused, and misrepresenting the situation... and that I've been completely honest and straightforward the entire time.

&gt;After all, two comments are two comments eh?

In this case, they're **the same two comments** referenced in the OP (which I even quoted as I responded directly to the statement in question).

&gt;Who cares if they're different comments than the ones the post was about and disputing claims that the original post never even made?

They weren't. Try reading a little more closely.

Looks like you might be out of practice when it comes to *actually reading*, considering how you like to skip that step so eagerly.

&gt;Maybe that kind of garbage logic slips past the redditors you haven't banned from /r/Bitcoin, but normal people who actually read things and think about them critically weren't fooled.

This is honestly *so funny* how much you're congratulating yourself on something you've misunderstood completely, with the truth sitting there waiting for you to realize it.

&gt;This is the exact type of retarded tactic that is why you aren't worth responding to. I learned long ago that Creationists and 9/11 Truthers aren't logical and are literally not worth talking to. You're squarely in that category and this is why.

I can't wait for the moment when you realize...

&gt;Maybe you should try not walking into a trap that demonstrates that you are shady lying fraud with your own words?

&gt;Roger's a damn saint compared to you.

Alright, are you done congratulating yourself? Time to go back and read the link (this time more closely, like I told you to in my last comment).

Doesnt work that way bud more than 50% of the mining of BTC is controlled by one entity in China,1522952218
Start of the year he was calling for 50K btc. We see how that went. ,1522952194
"Well let's take RawMidge then since that's the name I remember from recently. Looking at his history he's got a few posts from 6 months ago and then another page of posts from last week. That alone is typical for alternate accounts, short stretches of high activitity and then a longer silence.  
Now you might also notice his tone from the earlier posts as well as the recent ones is really negative, trying to invoke reactions from people on reddit. This has also resulted in a good amount of downvoted reactions.  

If we compare his karma according to profile to what his posts amount to you can quickly see it doesn't add up: posts have been deleted or are in private subreddits. I'd daresay it's a combination of those two because he deletes a lot of his downvoted posts in the daily threads here yet his total karma is way more than it ought to be. There are private subreddits for karmafarming so I presume he just posts there to remain above posting thresholds.  
[If I recall correctly this was one of his posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/89mznu/daily_general_discussion_april_4_2018/dwsbhw1/?context=1), suppose you can verify that being a mod. I don't react to posts like these generally so I'd have to skim the daily to find others.  
Last I'd like to point out this account shows no previous reddit interest in crypto, finance or anything prior to dropping in to bash projects. Could be coincidence and it's not actual proof of being an alternate account but it does fit the narrative perfectly.",1522952177

The next year will tell us a lot.  Like I say we are in total virgin territory.  Humans like to look back at the past and try and find similar examples, the fact is that this is 100% unique.  If anything it would make more sense to compare crypto with the early market for Gold.  That was very volatile in it's early years and took a long time to become stable. ",1522952028

"Your entire comment is pretty much bang on, and I agree, Bitcoin really isn't a currency in itself (for all the reasons you mention), it is a commodity. The problem with it being a commodity, though, is this:

&gt; All commodities have **utility** and they have a ""socially required labor time"" component attached to them to.

That is the one fundamental difference with Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) and traditional commodities. They have the latter, but they lack the former. There is no ""utility"" with Bitcoin, other than whatever the ability exists at a given time to exchange it for something else. 

As a commodity, foreign currencies and cryptocurrencies have the same issue with utility. You correctly identify that foreign currencies are only valuable in countries where they are a standard monetary unit. As long as those countries are stable and have export markets that offer useful goods, then foreign currency has extrinsic value because it can be traded for those goods, or can be traded for your local currency (the value of that trade, again, being tied to the purchasing power of useful goods offered by that foreign export market). If that country destabilizes, shuts down its export market, or in some other way loses the ability to offer useful products for trade, then the value of that foreign currency vanishes. 

Thus is the same thing with cryptocurrencies. They are a commodity, but only insofar as they can be traded for goods. If that ability vanishes, then they become worthless commodities. The market itself for these commodities is externally supported through trade alone.

Gold, copper, lumber, oil, all those can still be used to manufacture goods, so as long as there is the ability to consume a commodity, there will be a market to buy and sell that commodity, which means the market for traditional commodities is self-sustaining.",1522951899

"&gt;&amp;gt;No consensus is not the reason for the 1mb limit.
Protecting bitcoin against DDoS during its early days was the reason for the limit.
It was implemented later and was never meant to be a permanent economic feature.

&gt;True,  and consensus decided to retain that feature, for now.

True on the BTC fork.

And that mainly why it is a departure for the original design.

&gt;&amp;gt;If tomorrow Miner decided to soft fork BTC to limit it to one transactions per block don’t you agree it will be a radical change?
Yet it is a soft fork? No consensus rule broken, yet the currency is unusable, how do you explain that?

&gt;That's the precise reason nodes matter. Such a soft fork could be ignored by **you** if **your** node rejects such a change. 

No block will be valid. A node can’t detect a soft fork *by design*

&gt;The idiots who dominate this thread would have you believe otherwise, but actual peers who run nodes in this peers to peer system decide what blocks conform to the rules they want. 

If you ignore the longest chain you are HF away and breaking consensus too.

A hundred merchants won’t help the development.

It’s pretty logical to create a product, develop, fix bugs in phase 1. Phase two would be rollout and adoption. No point in selling something that’s half done.

BTC supporter or not, this is a sound strategy from a business perspective.

Would you expect large merchants to implement an alpha solution that is buggy, no. Hence, develop, prefect, rollout, adoption etc.

"Great idea.

I would actually frame it as a crypto discount rather than a fiat premium. People like discounts. They hate premiums.

I'd also consider reducing the discount to only 1% which is closer to the price of indifference. You probably want to encourage people to use crypto, who were on the borderline of using it (who would go for the 1% discount). Otherwise, you're throwing money at the wrong people and it probably won't stick.

It's better to offer many small discounts to convert all the best candidates than spend a bunch of money to get one guy to use crypto who might really have no interest.",1522951749
"Is saying the bitcoin ""bottom"" is just over the $6000 mark tempting fate?

I sure hope it's not and that we've reached a ""stable"" low - that, at least, is a platform to work from. 

It may end up being a pretty sane figure to rebase from, given the volume drop.

And by rebase, I mean, for the cryptocurrency market to mature more, to see some adoption of product - and hopefully, less of direct link to the price of bitcoin.",1522951740
"I don't necessarily agree with fiat creating alt decoupling, that is yet to be seen. Exchanges will only create pairs where there is enough demand for it. I know much people are exited to trade fiat but for all we know this might end up just the big ones and all other alts still only with a BTC pair. You *might* be right, but it's just speculation. More importantly to add to that, is that fiat pairs won't be possible on a DEX which might mean either a better fiat pegged token must be created or btc pairs will still stay king. Also to note, have you considered BTC is seen as a benchmark for the whole market and alt decoupling not resulting in less affection?

Conclusion; we don't know which direction the future is going for crypto, nor do we know if alts ever break free of BTC. All we do know, is that more DEX'es are a great thing to look forward to.",1522951696

By analogy, when the US went off the gold standard, many predicted collapse. Many still do. Maybe it will. Maybe it won't. It's unknowable. The dollar system does work, for now, and will keep working until it fails.  And yet, hundreds of millions of people use dollars every day.

Those reports discuss how economic freedom **in general** has impact on health. While this is true there is no causal relation between deaths and what BlockStream did with BTC. While you might speculate that there is a number x of people that would life if that would not have happend due to the positive effects on economic freedom of the then way better functioning Bitcoin network this is just that: speculation. You can't bring up a number of people that died because of that. Also you can't even show a single example \(please, correct me if I'm wrong\). Selling it as facts imho is not helpful but does discredit everyone that claims those are facts.

&gt; I am saying they held back Bitcoin for years and years witht he 1MB strangled limit. Many companies stopped accepting it. 

Okay got it. So I could now ask why you waited so long with the fork. If obvously everyone else sees it that way you could have done it long before and thus continue with the development the way the community demands it. Don't get me wrong: I have not follow the hole discussion in the last 3 years so I don't claim to have all the details. I'm just wondering why, if it was that bad all the time, the fork did not happen long before. 

Also: now that you got your BCH fork you could all be happy, right? Why do you even bother what they are doing? I mean obviously if they attack you saying you're ""fake bitcoin"" I get that you have to answer that. But again I'm not sure if it's helpfull adding fuel to the fire. The problem is not that it's not clear to anyone interested in that topic that BlockStream is a bunch of untrustworthy marionettes. It's just that most people don't give a shi\* about it. You say Bitcoin is for everyone. So, now you got everyone on the table. And guess what: most people are not IT pros, nerds, geeks, dorks. They want Bitcoin as a ""get\-rich\-quick"" investment, as a ""buy\-dope\-on\-darknet"" money or \- in case of africa \- to simply pay stuff with it. They could not care less about the politics behind the scene. They never heared of it. They don't care if they're played. They got other issues to worry about. They will use whatever satisfies their needs. If BTC is to expensive they'll go and use something else. If BTC is to slow, they'll do as well. They don't care if it's centralized as long as they can get the job done.

I'm not saying this because I want to attack you. Nothing would be further away from the truth. I'm saying this because I think you might overlook something: the masses, especially the one with \&lt;2$ per day, don't know anything about cryptos and they don't care about all those things that you argue about.

They'll use what works.

&gt; We didn't start this war, we didn't ask for this fight, but I am sure as hell not going to lay down and let [Bilderberg/AXA and the CIA](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7d02ee/some_thoughts_about_the_possible_bitcoin_segwit/) destroy and strangle Bitcoin and prevent freedom world wide. I am sorry but there is no talking about Bitcoin Cash without talking about Bitcoin Core's problems.  

Got it. Perfectly fine for me. All I'm saying you should focus your energy on the product. Make it as good as possible if you want to crush those fckers. Don't waste any more energy then needed in heated discussions with them. Releasing a new feature is worth more then 100 discussions. It will hurt them more. Masses don't follow those discussions anyways. As I already explained I believe masses also don't care.

Also what I wanted to say with my initial comment: you really, really should watch what you're saying. If you present something as facts you should have hard \(like rock solid\) proof. NOT because I and others that share your views would not believe you but because you can only fight lies with truth. If you lie only once \- hell don't even lie, it's enough if you claim something you have no hard proofs about \- they will use it against you to discredit you. The people that DO follow the discussion will no longer listen to you. I blieve there are many people like me who follow this stuff behind the scenes and remain silent. 

I now only went active to let you know that while PASSION is great you should use it only in a positive way. Build something. Add value to the Crypto projects that are envolving. But when in a discussion to the general public too much passion will make you look like fanatics. You don't want that. That's just what they want. So be rational. Present hard evidence if you claim something right in that moment. DON'T get into heated discussions but be the voice of reason in this mess. And you will win. ",1522950984
"When you have less economic freedom, you have a higher infant mortality rate.   That means more dead babies.   Nobody disputes this.  You can search economic freedom to find video after video, from 2 minute shorts to hour long documentaries, covering the topic of economic freedom, many will have the same or similar stats as presented by Roger.

Here in the west, Bitcoin represents a full order of magnitude increase in our economic freedom.  That translates fewer dead babies for us.  But Bitcoin also represents a several orders of magnitude increase in economic freedom for people who live in places with higher mortality rates.  Ergo a *lot* fewer dead babies.

With their censorship, propaganda, sockpuppeting, and 'soft fork' BTC devs took control of the network and crippled Bitcoin functionality, preventing adoption that could have taken place, including where it is most needed.  

When Bitcoin was getting all that hype a few months back, had it actually worked as intended at the time (like Bitcoin Cash does), then a lot more adoption may have taken place.  We don't know.

Just because you don’t believe in the way they are choosing to go about scaling and tech doesn’t mean they aren’t taking action. You just don’t agree with it. To think that if btc had just kept increasing the block size then it would be fully adopted world wide by now saving lives is rediculous. We all know it’s going to take decades for any crypto to be adopted world wide and to to say blockstream is responsible for killing people for POSSIBLY slowing adoption by a few years is insane. ,1522950813

Not at all, probably. They just don't care about the politics of Bitcoin and that's entirely their prerogative.

"Good to think bold, but bad to have lingering Blockstream Syndrome about it by falling for all the canards Core raised in its scorched earth attempt to maintain power.

This was the cue for altcoin mania as well as the impulse never to leave the warm comfortable spot under the wing of Core ""experts"" and their ""full validating nodes"" (that don't validate blocks and aren't nodes). 

**Think boldly and consider that maybe Bitcoin can do it all essentially as it was originally designed.** Bitcoin was no evolutionary random lucky minimum-viable combo of older tech, but a very deliberately designed stroke of genius by someone who understood a great many things and had a far-reaching vision that merely got clouded and distorted little by little by the machinations of status-seekers, and these people have now been forked away in a remarkably clean sweep.",1522950681

"&gt; I think there is a fierce mentality in the crypto community against cutting losses.

It's not just here.  Although it's basic risk management, a lot of people are just bad at it.  When I was younger, I was pretty bad at poker but played regular games so I studied some of the strategies and theory behind it.  I went from it being a gamble (like most players) to playing semi-professionally and doubling my pay checks.

The biggest changes I made were to stick to a strategy with very few exceptions, and to cut my losses if it looked like it was done.  Once the money goes into the pot, it's no longer mine. Each stage is basically a fresh round where I determine whether or not I stand a good chance to take it.  If not, it's not worth losing money trying to do so.

Crypto is similar.  I'm still focused on playing the people angle more so than the numbers, the strategy matters, and if it starts to go south, it's time to get out.

You're 100% right though. Most of the community is HODL no matter the  cost, just like most people playing poker (note I didn't say *poker players*) will regularly bet on that 1% chance to hit the river.  But it doesn't just help the whales. It helps anyone that wants to actively trade it.

I get people wanting to minimize their risk and focus only on long term... but I mean, realistically, if you're trying to avoid risk crypto is probably not the place to do it.  Plus, if we're talking about long term why *wouldn't* you want to increase those holdings?

Oh well. I won't complain... I'm sure that's where a lot of the gains I've gotten are coming from.",1522950599

"All commodities have utility and they have a ""socially required labor time"" component attached to them to. The way we derive exchange value to them them is to go to exchange. Things that can be sold for more than the labor time component will generate a profit and will trade in the capitalist economy. All this exchange is done with a standard of value which is our obligation to government. Bitcoin cannot approach standard of value without government recognition as a means to settle obligation to it, so it more or less bound to be commodity until, and if, it ever is raised to higher levels of importance. If one could directly meet his obligation to government with lumber it would work as a universal standard of value and we could turn on our computers and see that bitcoin was last traded for x amounts of lumber. It is by settling our obligation in something that we standardize it. All of government's effort is in managing the obligations. Assets worth the obligation are seized form you when they are not met, pinning down the rock solid value of money. A foreign currency to a sovereign government does not work to do that. It will say to you: go to market and trade your foreign currency as a commodity and settle with us in dollars please. Foreign money is not money anywhere else but home, unless a government comes to accept someone' else currency as their own. The US dollar might have this ability in some countries.",1522949777

"If you create a new coin with bitcoin in the name, you are running a scam.

"And didn't need to be one of them. In fact, other than coding resources being diluted, splits strengthen Bitcoin as they provide an opportunity for the people that ultimately control it - the investors - to rarify, that is, for the less savvy ones to lose money to the more savvy ones, making the decision-makers consist of those who are ever more intelligent.

"We might think it's stupidly easy to buy and send BTC, but that whole process needs to become significantly *easier* than it currently is for mainstream adoption and use. 

We more of an an adoption system a-la fed.network.  For example, if my Name*fed.network XLM wallet tag was associated with all of my social media, someone could say ""hey let's send iaccidentlytheworld $50 worth of crypto"" and they wouldn't need to type out some stupidly complex public key.  

We also need to get away from centralized exchanges (eventually) because what's the difference between coinbase merchant integration and the current, traditional e-remittances and credit and such?   People need control of their keys to have point 1 work. 

Lastly we need cross-chain bridging to work effectively so that if I have $50 worth of XLM and my friend wants me to send them XMR, I don't need to sell XLM to BTC, use BTC to buy XMR, and then send that over.  Something like REQ (and 100 others I'm sure) will facilitate this process.

"I'm going to have to disagree with you.

Why would holders chose to sell off a large amount of BTC near the bottom so they can pay off taxes all at once? If they are believers in the tech and they have a payment plan option, why wouldn't they do that? If they take the payment plan option it allows them time for BTC to go back up, thus they wont have to sell as much of their stacks.",1522949682
"Yes, you are absolutely correct.  When I said I intended to wait until $3K to buy, I meant for a longer-term hold.  But you are 100% right, there will be opportunities along the way to buy on falls to support and sell on bounces to resistance.  If played patiently and correctly, it could lead to precisely what you say, i.e. adding some powder for purchases at the bottom.

Congrats on being back to nearly pre-crash prices.  If I had figured this out long ago I would be in better shape now.  But it's all a learning process.  And yes, it's what you do with your learning that really matters.

I think there is a fierce mentality in the crypto community against cutting losses.  The HODL mentality is strong here, like The Force.  It took me a whole to realize that HODLing a portfolio of coins and watching it sink further into the red makes no sense if I could sell, even at a ""loss"", and buy back that same portfolio (or more) months later for a lot less $$.  I bought ADA at $.40 then dumped it at $.30 for a loss.  It's $.14 now.  If I can buy it back at $.10 or less, I will consider that a win.  I think a lot of people will be surprised just how low these ALTS can go when BTC breaches $5K and all hell breaks loose.

The HODL mentality works to the great advantage of whales.  When they know that they can count on a large chunk of people who won't sell, regardless of price, it makes it much easier for them to pump and dump.

We are most definitely on the same page.",1522949663

"&gt; I would object to treating Bitcoin as a currency because it functions nowhere as the universal standard of value It's commodity everywhere.

That's the catch-22 problem with Bitcoin. It was envisioned to be traded as a currency and is billed by many (including its inventor) as a currency, so people see it as a currency. By its own design, though, it is closer to a commodity, because it is not the predominant currency *anywhere*. The problem with seeing it as a commodity is that, unlike traditional commodities, it only exists as something to be traded. It has no functional value of its own the way Oil or Gold or Lumber has. 

Where the problem is exacerbated is that the ""commodity"" nature of Bitcoin makes it very volatile, and the value fluctuates wildly (compared to most other currencies). The only currencies that see this kind of fluctuation are those that are experiencing either hyperinflation (Russia in the early 90's), or deflation. Couple that with the ""currency"" nature of it where it is meant to be traded continuously at a much more rapid pace than most traditional commodities, and you have the accounting nightmare that we're talking about. 

Multicurrency accounting systems deal with this well, but even that accounting has a built-in assumption of some level of stability in the currency (making gain/loss recognition something companies can deal with on a quarterly or annual basis, instead of on a daily basis). But without the kind of automation that those accounting systems offer, tracking these gains and losses is absolutely a hassle. 

People interested in that sort of accounting usually live outside the United States. Here in Canada, we have to deal with it all the time, because most Canadian businesses at least deal with US businesses and have to do so in US Dollars. ",1522949059

"&gt; It's tempting to think that what happened was a freak one-off occurrence, but I don't think it was.

There is a pretty major difference between now and 2014 though. At the time, Bitcoin was (effectively) the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. If you wanted to be involved, you really had to be involved with Bitcoin.

People were (very) afraid of what might happen if the Bitcoin community split. Altcoins were mostly seen as a testbed fire new Bitcoin features. Talk of ""if an altcoin implemented something useful, Bitcoin could just roll it into the next release"" was extremely common.

That was then. Now, people are not afraid to buck the trend by forking their own coin. In fact they're economically incentivized to do so.

In 2018, the playing field is much more level than it's ever been. Nobody gets to be the king of the development castle anymore. That's the big difference between now and then. The sense of unity that we once felt has been shattered.

"&gt; It's tempting to think that what happened was a freak one-off occurrence, but I don't think it was.

There is a pretty major difference between now and 2014 though. At the time, Bitcoin was (effectively) the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. If you wanted to be involved, you really had to be involved with Bitcoin.

People were (very) afraid of what might happen if the Bitcoin community split. Altcoins were mostly seen as a testbed fire new Bitcoin features. Talk of ""if an altcoin implemented something useful, Bitcoin could just roll it into the next release"" was extremely common.

That was then. Now, people are not afraid to buck the trend by forking their own coin. In fact they're economically incentivized to do so.

In 2018, the playing field is much more level than it's ever been. Nobody gets to be the king of the development castle anymore. That's the big difference between now and then. The sense of unity that we once felt has been shattered.

"The economic is mediated by the political. The economic is very much objective in what it does. Everything we would call subjective enters into the discussion by way of the political sphere.

The properties that I call undesirable were recognized to be undesirable properties for a universal standard of wealth. If a society works towards equality and absence of too much hierarchy you cannot have a standard in place that is easily controllable by a few powerful hands. The boundless nature of fiat and the ability to not have it be cornered and hoarded allows many the freedom to not have to slave to an owner of money in order to get his hands on some. It allows for expansion that lessens the hoarders strength. If money were as bitcoin in property, no one would have any interest to spend it beyond his needs and he would reap a great benefit from being first to get it in a landscape of increasing demand and population. Our money has evolved to be a better social tool, but here is Bitcoin trying to bring back undesirable aspects because it has a argument that might favor the early adopter of the scheme.",1522948643

"Hmm, see, I think on a similar vein, I'm long ago playing with house money and I put in what I could afford to lose.

The question I was asking was more a theoretical thing - What event would make you sell it all and say fuck it? 

For instance, say my ""house money"" investment was $10k (Purely theoretical round numbers) - I have a stable job, savings, I'm fine if I lose all $10k. 

At what point do you call Crypto a failed experiment and withdraw what's left of that house money? 

Not saying it is a failed experiment - But is it at a monetary value? Moral standpoint? Regulation issue?  

Personally, I think my own point would be Banks offering the same services as say, NANO - A coin backed up on a public blockchain that allows instant, secure transfer of value that is not backed by any business, purely acting as a 3rd party in the transaction. 

In terms of a currency standpoint, and someone who has bank accounts in multiple countries, there are multiple barriers I like that crypto eliminates:

- Time to transfer is far too high.
- Security is based solely upon banks instead of an immutable ledger
- Cost is too prohibitive

If banking can eliminate these obstacles, Cryptocurrency holds a lot less value because I get the full value from a traditional bank and there are fewer uses for Crypto - Use factor falls into something like recordkeeping and waste management in that case.

Keep and open mind, and play less armchair psychologist.",1522948181
"&gt; Agree. But gold can be used as money if you value it against the local currency you work in.

There's a very subtle difference. For Gold to be used as Currency, it has to contain some other value than its own intrinsic value. If Gold is simply traded as the value per ounce of whatever purity of gold you are trading, then what you're *really* doing is trading a commodity, not money. That's why you can ""back"" currency with gold, but you can't back gold with currency (you can only exchange it for currency).

&gt; Fiat currencies. Yes. They're good choices for investing because your choice is to lose 3% of your purchasing power yearly (USD) to inflation.

Yes, because stagnant currency has no actual purpose. When I say inflation leads to investment, it isn't just personal investment in things like commodities or the stock market I'm talking about. I'm talking about businesses investing in capital projects, or businesses taking on risky ventures. It is business investment itself that drives the economy. Deflationary currency makes the cost for businesses to borrow that currency expensive, which in turn chills business investment. Which in turn slows the economy and makes *all* currency devalue. 

&gt; How much energy does it take to transport, create, secure, insure, manage, etc USD and other fiat? I'm talking data centers, bank employees, bailout, fraud, counterfeiting. USD has plenty of ""energy"" costs that are spread out into other places. Bitcoin seems larger because you can see it all in one place. It's far more predictable.

Cryptocurrency doesn't remove the need for all that other infrastructure. That argument is a red herring. There is still a need for lending institutions, tax regulations, security systems, and auditing systems. There is no need for anti-counterfeiting measures *yet* because cryptocurrencies are still in their infancy and are difficult to replicate. The only real thing that cryptocurrencies actually replace is physical cash, which is largely being replaced by electronic funds transfer all over the world, anyway. The only difference is that it takes a very, very small amount of energy to create a unit of cash compared to a unit of crypocurrency. 

Cryptocurrency only ever had one purpose, and that is to replace the need for a central authority (ie, government) to control the production and exchange of currency. It does not replace the need to secure that currency, to audit the business use of that currency, the taxation of that currency, or to control the exchange of that currency with other currencies. 

Bitcoin seems large because it has a very large footprint relative to the actual size of the currency itself. Bitcoin uses almost the same amount of energy and infrastructure that the US Dollar does in aggregate, but it doesn't even handle 1/1000th of a percentage of transactions. I'd hate to see the kind of environmental impact that there would be if the world really did business in Bitcoin to the same degree that it does in US Dollars.

&gt; They have plenty of intrinsic value. That's why people keep buying them and developing for the protocol. Just because you can't wrap your head around that value doesn't mean the value isn't there.

That is not *intrinsic* value, that is *extrinsic* value. Intrinsic value means value within itself. Bitcoin has none. It only has value relative to the things that it can be exchanged for. The same as fiat currency. 

&gt; I would contend that you have some research to do. Because it sounds like you've been listening to Peter Schiff and Paul Krugman.

I've done plenty of research. I have a degree in accounting and have done extensive study in economics. I work in accounting systems and deal with multiple currencies (including cryptocurrencies) for large businesses every day. I have probably more real world experience in finance than most people who post in this subreddit.  As for Peter Schiff and Paul Krugman - I don't recall reading anything by them, but very well could have. That you discount two very well recognized experts in economics tells me all I need to know about the common level of knowledge that you have about how money works. I would bet you probably spent more time reading Zeitgeist than any actual economics journal.",1522948153

Someone more knowledgable about the guts of bitcoin/lightning transactions than me might have more concrete numbers, If LN wanted to grow, say, at the rate of facebook (which based on their public stats, added about 6 new users every second on average between 2009 and 2017), the channel opening TXs would completely saturate the current network.",1522948095
"&gt; What do you think about 10 minutes block interval in BCH - should it be lowered a bit (2.5 minutes), changed radically (like ETH/GHOST) or left alone?

My name is not Mike, but still I have a strong opinion on this :-)

We've seen capacity bottle necks in the ETH network, the so-called ""uncle rate"", which is sort of equivalent with ""orphan rate"" in BTC, has been as high as 30%.  That's terrible - this is the sort of problem Core has been warning so much about all the time.  BCH can handle much more traffic than ETH, for two and only two reasons - one is all the optimizations that have gone into Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Core over the last few years, the other reason is the 10 minute target block interval vs 15 seconds for Ethereum.

Within the PoW framework, 15 seconds just doesn't scale.  And still, 15 seconds is quite far from ""immediate"", for short block intervals to be useful i.e. for the cash register at a busy super market the interval can't be much more than a second.

Without PoW, one can probably forgo the notion of blocks at all - such as Corda does - but within PoW 10 minute block intervals is probably quite OK.  We still have zero-conf - which for all practical purposes are much safer than credit card transactions.  That is, all until some selfish miners decides to do RBF on their mining nodes.

"**Ripple (payment protocol)**

Ripple is a centralized real-time gross settlement system (RTGS), currency exchange and remittance network created by the Ripple company. Also called the Ripple Transaction Protocol (RTXP) or Ripple protocol, it is built upon a distributed open source internet protocol, consensus ledger and native cryptocurrency abbreviated as XRP (ripples). Released in 2012, Ripple purports to enable ""secure, instantly and nearly free global financial transactions of any size with no chargebacks."" It supports tokens representing fiat currency, cryptocurrency, commodity or any other unit of value such as frequent flier miles or mobile minutes. At its core, Ripple is based around a shared and public database or ledger, which uses a consensus process that allows for payments, exchanges and remittance in a distributed process.

"To avoid a monopoly you need only two miners, and to avoid a 51 % miner you need three independent miners. It is good to have more, the whole spectrum of medium size miners and smaller miners, because they can step up if one becomes dominant (51%).

The problem of monopoly or a monopolistic cartel is largely overblown, because if one dominant group (a cartel) raises prices or reduces output, it also improves the profit for the competition outside the cartel, it increases the profit for someone inside the cartel to cheat, and the added buraucracy for the group makes it less profitable, and the bureaucracy cost tends to increase if they manage to make extra profit. This is explained in depth by Rothbard, Mises and others, even Henry Ford. Most business leaders understand it i suppose, but sometimes they make loud noises if someone overtakes them, and ask for regulation. Regulation can be seen as securing a monopoly or cartel for the existing large businesses with the help of privileges from the state, supported by nonvoluntary intrusion into the market.

If some large mining entity is taken over to further some goal that is different from profit maximization for the long run, their profit will immediately take a hit and they will not be large anymore.

Also note that a mining pool is not the important entity, it is somewhat important but it is the individual miner that runs the show, it is the one who has invested in mining equipment.

With bitcoin mining, the danger of a cartel supported by coercion is minimal, because there is a built in protection, the mining can happen anywhere and there is a low threshold to entry.",1522947096

It is complicated because you have to average the cost of every bitcoin, or fraction of one, in a time sensitive way.

"&gt;Bitcoin-Qt was *the* implementation back then too. It was actually Satoshi who was opposed to any alternative implementations. He felt that it would never be necessary.

I was hoping you'd touch on that.

I agree that the idea of a monolithic implementation that defines the protocol goes back to Satoshi. I also agree it was a mistake.

&gt;The renaming from Bitcoin-Qt to Bitcoin Core was my idea. Or at least I proposed the name ""Core"". Perhaps ironic in hindsight. But Bitcoin-Qt wasn't a very descriptive name, was it? 

LoL I didn't mean to throw you under the bus.

I think at that time you and others were operating under the idea that ""the team defines the coin,"" and the problem to be solved was how to create a decentralized ""government"" to manage the team.

I think what we've learned since then is that this was a mistake. 

I think we've learned that teams are like political parties. None has a monopoly on good ideas, and that they propose but the constituency disposes.

Bitcoin BTC bears a strong political resemblance to any single-party state - or better, to a sham multiparty state, in that other parties are tolerated as long as they never threaten the power monopoly which defines the consensus rules.

So trying to overlay ""governance"" on a single party state is analogous to trying to make the Communist Party of China more representative of the people's will: good motive but fundamentally the system isn't designed to do that.

BCH governance is therefore more like Swiss cantons, in that there are many teams, and the community values the diversity they bring, yet all teams have an incentive to try to work together in as far as possible.


&gt;Me too. I've been interested in cryptographic voting for years.

Here I think Satoshi got it right.  Voters vote with their CPU power, expressing agreement by building on blocks they agree with, and orphaning the ones that they find disagreeable.

Any forms of voting that don't require skin in the game are inherently flawed.  Only by committing resources to build a block can we ensure that most miners will call a committed vote according to their actual interests.",1522946717
"I would definitely recommend taking a good look at it, may not be something you end up investing in personally but smart contracts are a major component to the crypto space and a block chain agnostic solution to connect any chain to the outside world is a game changer. The team is solid. Do some research on Serg &amp; smartcontracts.com in addition to the token/use case. Solid team with an extremely deep understanding of the use case for what they are creating and going the opposite of 99% of projects and getting the work done before any marketing/hype I have different amounts that I plan to sell throughout the ride up should it happen the way I for-see (obviously hope) it will do. But have a good sized stack to sell at the end of where I see it getting to that I won't touch before then, whether it be tomorrow or several years down he line. Yes biz is Fucking terrible and there are a million memes about chainlink, but most coins have the moon/Lambo dumbasses out there if you look hard enough for info online ",1522946717

"&gt;  I was one of Emin's biggest fans until 5 days ago because he seemed scientific and cold minded. 

That makes two of us. Peter has been showing signs of elitism and cloudy thinking for a little while, but he is also not so full of himself as to refuse to engage or re-evaluate. Emin was a rock star five days ago, yet now here he is attempting to dissuade open discussion through *ad hominem* attacks. It's more than disappointing to see this happen, but it is inevitable. We cannot revere Emin and Peter (or Amury or Craig, for that matter) any more than we dared revere theymos and nullc. Look where it got us last time!

Bitcoin is not about people, it's about ideas and mathematics. Let the math speak for itself - when someone says ""you're so wrong I can't be arsed to show you where"" that usually means that they can't immediately see why and are *assuming* that their work is correct instead. This is how bad ideas get adopted: when challenges to those ideas are dismissed without evaluating their merit.

I agree. It is *disgusting*. It is a horrendous waste of talent and time for Emin and Peter to continue down this road. This is a debate we had years ago - selfish mining strategies are not new, and have been considered since 2009.",1522946672

- Bitcoin returning to the levels of early 2017 - $1000 apiece

- Severe government regulations 
- Volume dropping below a certain level - Maybe $1 billion a day total across all of crypto

- The way I interpret the comment, the confiscation of bitcoin and/or gold by the government is justified and citizens should trade stores-of-value for fiat currency when the government demands so, to 'save' the economy. 
- In doing so, the comment presumes that persisting the gold standard, and attempting to manipulate the money supply through it, is beneficial for the economy, but, many economists argue that the gold standard exacerbated monetary contraction and deflation during the great depression
- Moreover, the government itself played a major role in worsening the great depression (i.e. Smoot Hawtley 1932) and the comment gives too much credit to the government's decision making capability during that time.

"Selling pressure in cryptocurrencies could ease after tax day.

The April 15 income-tax filing deadline is contributing to crypto’s falling prices as investors who won big betting on the digital tokens sell some of their remaining holdings to pay $25 billion in capital-gains levies, Tom Lee, the head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, wrote in a note Thursday. Bitcoin dropped more than 40 percent over the past month, including a 2.4 percent decline on Thursday to $6,664 as of 9:39 a.m. in New York.

“This is a massive outflow from crypto to dollars,” Lee wrote. “Historical estimates are each $1 of USD outflow is $20-$25 impact on crypto market value.”

Lee says that $25 billion prediction -- derived from his estimate that U.S. households had $92 billion in taxable gains from cryptocurrencies in 2017 -- would represent 20 percent of capital-gains tax receipts to the U.S. Treasury. He estimates total capital gains receipts will hit a record $168 billion for tax-year 2017.

A crypto bull who maintains a year-end price target on Bitcoin of $25,000, Lee sees the selling pressure passing.

It is ""possible"" to execute this attack, in certain conditions with certain parameters, with a chance of success that exceeds 50%. Practically, those circumstances will never happen: there must be difficulty adjustment, precise shares of hashpower, and good old-fashioned favorable luck for the ""attack"" to succeed.

I still don't call it an attack, though; it's a strategy (and a bad one). If miners mine transactions into blocks, it is irrelevant *how* they compete for them. Bitcoin works just fine even if SM strategy is employed in the optimal environment; in a worst-case scenario, users would be forced to wait for 2 confirms instead of one.

I think this ""debate"" is the real ""spam attack"". Selfish mining strategies are irrelevant to Bitcoin's functionality and do not heavily impact its utility even in an adverse condition. If SM is so powerful, then stop wasting our time trying to scare us into doing something about it and *prove that it works by using it for personal gain*.",1522945820
Profits are not marginal if 1. Your power is cheap enough. 10c usd / kwh or less.   2 you have enough miners.  2-4 and scaling up happens pretty quick. -when bitcoin isn’t crashing-  my s9 is a little above breaking even. Profits return when price goes up.  I mean just before the crash these miners were making 1k usd per month.  I just see it as a investment to grow in a strange way.  ,1522945819

"&gt; Any statistics that show that corellation and any evidence there is an actual causal relation?

Yes there was a thread about that: https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89t1cc/think_roger_was_exaggerating_when_he_said_samson/

&gt; Are you saying people are dying because BCH is not 'named' Bitcoin? 

I am saying they held back Bitcoin for years and years witht he 1MB strangled limit.  Many companies stopped accepting it.  They did untold damage to adoption.  They ruined Bitcoin's reputation as a cash system with the giant fees, they gave people a shitty experience and turned people away.  They stopped companies like [Fidelity from experimenting on the blockchain because if they flipped the switch on their beta it would instantly fill capacity](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/76glrd/jeff_garzik_in_2015_talks_about_how_fidelity/).  Builders, innovators, and companies moved on to other crypto projects on other chains.  The network effect has been damaged and less people are using crypto and Bitcoin because of it and there is less economic freedom in this world because they Blocked th Stream.

[Bilderberg/AXA, and the CIA](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7d02ee/some_thoughts_about_the_possible_bitcoin_segwit/) have done untold damage do Bitcoin and have held back the economic liberation of people world wide.  While Chief Strategy Officer of BlockStream, Samson Mow says [Bitcoin is not for poor people](https://twitter.com/excellion/status/783994642463326208?lang=en).  

They can slow us down but they cannot stop us, and they underestimated Bitcoin Cash and the power of the community and market to resist their takekover.

&gt; why should it be BCH? Why not any other Crypto out there? 

The reason is because money and Bitcoin itself is just a ledger [as this video explains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3HSaUxD1rU).  Its also why I was [able to predict BCH before it existed](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/68jja0/dont_forget_money_and_bitcoin_are_just_a_ledger/dgyysp0/):

&gt; They can't hold back Bitcoin forever. If they continue to strangle it resulting in more fees, eventually there will be ledger based forks that have higher capacity. In the future there may be many Bitcoin ledger-based forks which are new blockchains with coins distributed based on Bitcoin public addresses. For example there can be an Ethereum blockchain forked based on Bitcoin's coin distribution. Investors should remember this when investing in Bitcoin. There is a huge future potential that holding coins on this ledger gives. This is the #1 ledger, no other ledger is going to catch up to it, even if AXA/Bilderberg funded Blockstream Core try their hardest to hold it back. Bitcoin is money, period.

&gt;  If you want to become what Bitcoin was ment to be you got to stop the fight against BTC and put that enerhy in better tech

We didn't start this war, we didn't ask for this fight, but I am sure as hell not going to lay down and let [Bilderberg/AXA and the CIA](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7d02ee/some_thoughts_about_the_possible_bitcoin_segwit/) destroy and strangle Bitcoin and prevent freedom world wide. I am sorry but there is no talking about Bitcoin Cash without talking about Bitcoin Core's problems.  Derek Magill really sums it up in this article, [""The fact is that the good things about Bitcoin Cash are inseparably bound up with the bad things about Bitcoin Core.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/846fje/people_say_that_we_should_stop_focusing_on/).  Core would want nothing more than for us to shut up, that is why they censor us.  For example [I was permanently banned for fake made up reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/61umvx/just_got_permanently_banned_from_rbitcoin_for/), by [Dragons Den](http://telegra.ph/Inside-the-Dragons-Den-Bitcoin-Cores-Troll-Army-04-07) member /u/bashco.

"&gt;e used a lot of british terminology. Also not noted above, he used the word Favour not favor which is british spelling. How can we explain this? unless it was deliberate?

Satoshi was (pretty clearly) obsessed with identity security, and it seems like he was extremely knowledgeable with regards to informational security. I would find it incredibly surprising if he wasn't aware of (and taking into account) stylometry as a possible vulnerability in terms of identity management.

In light of this, the British spellings and idioms (which he did use very consistently) have never seemed to be that compelling of a data point. Similarly, the ""The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks."" embedded in the Genesis Block, which is sometimes cited as evidence that Satoshi lived in the UK, seems like it could just as well be a deliberate red herring.

Committing to a ""pretend I'm British"" approach would be a very clever way to obscure your identity from determined researchers, and I don't put it past Satoshi at all. Perhaps I'm overthinking it, but that's my opinion on the subject.

The timezones are tricky, too, and invite another relevant question: what hours did he keep? I know plenty of engineers who do their best work late at night, and depending on his occupation (which is another thing we don't know anything about), his opportunity for ""time-slots dedicated to Bitcoin"" would have been affected. All of this is hard to guess at. However, one thing worth mentioning is that on the rare situations when a ""crisis"" would emerge, Satoshi would consistently be fairly quick to respond. He seems to have been able to keep a relatively close eye on Bitcoin's growth during the early years.

I don't personally know where Szabo was employed during this time (and in fact, the general lack of identity information that we have access to about Szabo is a point in favor of the hypothesis that he is Satoshi, if you ask me). The two biggest points *against* this hypothesis are: 1) He has denied it outright, and 2) It seems like if we're going to attribute legendary anonymity-preservation abilities to Satoshi, it's hard to reconcile that with ""...except it's pretty easy to guess who he is if you know much about Nick Szabo.""

Swiss referendums have quite low turnout relative to most votes, but there is a culture here in which citizens feel a responsibility to participate, so that puts a floor on how low participation can drop. One problem most coins that try to decentralise power have, is that most users don't know or care about the things being voted on. That suggests a more traditional Parliamentary style system may be more appropriate at this stage.",1522944677

"BCH has 1 to 4 GB blocks at the point it reaches VISA level scaling. That’s 1000 times bigger than the current BTC blocks. Suppose your rent is $500 per month. Then it gets to $500,000 per month. A factor of thousand is a lot. And they are talking about TB blocks already, which is a million times increase. But This level of scaling is still only VISA level. So, you can do some remittances and such, but paying for coffee on a global level? Meh. And doing the really interesting stuff we can’t do today, such as paying $0.01 for reading an article, or paying a movie per second, or paying a taxi per meter, things that are going to create a new economy, you can’t do that.

Well, the blockchain only needs to know the initial and final state of the channel balances.  The intermediate ones only need to be known by the participants, so you could have any number of transactions in between.

&gt; Why would blockchain congestion still be an issue if lightning network is fully adopted? Isn't the point of LN to avoid congestion in the network.

It is, but it's a layer running on top of bitcoin.  You can still just use bitcoin as-is.  Opening, contesting, and closing channels requires on-chain transactions.

"**Marginalism**

Marginalism is a theory of economics that attempts to explain the discrepancy in the value of goods and services by reference to their secondary, or marginal, utility. The reason why the price of diamonds is higher than that of water, for example, owes to the greater additional satisfaction of the diamonds over the water. Thus, while the water has greater total utility, the diamond has greater marginal utility.

Although the central concept of marginalism is that of marginal utility, marginalists, following the lead of Alfred Marshall, drew upon the idea of marginal physical productivity in explanation of cost.

"they don't need one for what they are trying to accomplish: here is a breakdown of Dragon to help in understanding the platform. This is credit to Cryptohemlok

A lot of people don't understand Dragonchain because they don't read the architecture document or they don't take the time to use Dragonchains opensource code to spin up a node and test it out themselves. I've done both so I will try to explain in the best way possible what each facet of Dragonchain does.

1) Yes, the Dragon token (DRGN) is ERC20. This does not mean that Dragonchain is JUST an ERC20 token. They chose to use the Ethereum platform to launch their token in order to showcase what their blockchain technology can do.

2) And yes, that means Dragonchain DOES in fact have their own blockchain. No, they do not have a mainnet, but they do have a working blockchain that is independent of Ethereum. I have spun up a Dragonchain node with the opensource code on their github and tested this myself. You can run your own Dragonchain blockchain. You can create smart contracts and deploy them on your own blockchain. All of this can be done with the opensource code.

Why then does Dragonchain have an ERC20 token, you may ask?

3) Apart from their opensource github, they also have a commercial platform. This is under development right now and is being released in the coming week (they just put a video out on it today). This commercial platform includes all functionality in the opensource code with addition features. The features include interoperability between public blockchains, as well as private and public level Dragonchains working in conjunction:

4) (the answer to why DRGN is ERC20) Dragons (DRGNS) will be used to provision smart contracts on these commercial platforms. There are 5 layers of consensus which a commercial platform can choose to run on. Layer 5 is a public-chain level consensus bridge. This means that transactions and smart contracts that are running on a Dragonchain have the ability to execute and target OTHER public blockchains (ETH, EOS, XAS, STRAT, BTC, You name it). This is why Dragonchain chose to have an ERC20 token as their currencty. They wanted to show off that they have the ability, using their technology, to send transactions between other blockchains. This has never been done before, and people don't understand it yet. They are simply hung up on the ERC20 token and they think it's all crap.",1522943430

You guys blame BTC for censorship and I agree: those guys that overtook BTC are lame fckrs.

"Thanks! Yeah, Corda is a fun project!

&gt; Is there a place or link we can check out the Corda roadmap?

The Corda blog is useful: https://medium.com/corda

The white paper is a bit stale. It has a few sections we haven't implemented. We'd like to implement them in future, so that's sort of a roadmap.

Truth is the project is huge, and we're exploring uncharted waters. So there are a lot of sub-roadmaps but not a single unified committed-to roadmap. Most of my TODO list these days consists of writing documents and blog posts explaining the roadmap and what we're doing.

But at the moment we're working on a really fast, stable and production-ready enterprise node. That was something Bitcoin always lacked. Companies like Coinbase invariably write their own node because Core/Qt/etc couldn't scale well (in particular their wallet didn't scale well). 

We're also setting up a shared network that can run many apps. That doesn't sound special but to make it clear how far most of the enterprise blockchain space has wandered from Satoshi's original thinking, our competitors don't even think about having a unified network at all! Check out this blog post by Richard (Gendal Brown, some may remember his writings on Bitcoin):

https://medium.com/corda/universal-interoperability-why-enterprise-blockchain-applications-should-be-deployed-to-shared-3d4daff97754

So IBM just set up a new isolated Fabric network for every customer. Well if you ever dealt with banks you know why - that's the path of least resistance - but it eliminates most of the future benefits of blockchain technology.

To get companies to work together you have to answer a lot of questions up front - mostly related to, guess what, governance :)",1522942751
"&gt;Do government agencies have easy access to your emails? YUP
&gt;
&gt;Is Bitcoin going to avoid that pitfall? YUP

This being the case, I think you have a responsibility to change your clickbait misleading title, because as it stands, you are saying something *dangerous*. People may be led to believe, from your article, that ""there is no security tradeoff to running a thin client"", but AT BEST this is only true AFTER your system is developed and widely deployed. 

Anyways, now that I understand what you are suggesting, I do think it is an interesting proposal, perhaps worth exploring for some specific cases. What is tricky is that your system isn't backwards compatible, and requires both the sender and receiver to play ball. 

Furthermore, you are too quick to dismiss concerns 2 and 3. Currently, sending bitcoin is as simple as broadcasting a transaction, and then moving on with your life. Here, a sender must remain online until their sent transaction is included in a block, and then they must form a direct connection to the recipient to send the merkle branch. You say they will most likely be connected, but this is clearly not the case. In fact, SPV clients are *never* connected to each other in typical usage. 

The other thing I'm confused about is how the sender gets the merkle branch. Downloading block headers is insufficient, and the sender often won't know the address of the recipient until actually making the transaction, so they can't include other peoples' recipient addresses in their bloom filters. And repeatedly sending new bloom filters is the worst thing a thin client can do for their privacy.",1522942735

Any time Nike and Lebron launch a new shoe, have new merchandise they want to sell, or any merchandise Nike/Lebron decide is exclusive, the customer must buy LeBron coin to purchase the merchandise. Lebron coin goes way up in value from when he was 16 years old to now 17 years later. Lebron makes a ton of money from the value of his coin, anyone who bought and held LeBron coin makes a ton of money, Nike makes a ton of money, etc....

"&gt; Right now I don't see anything that would prevent a repeat of what happened before, especially given the underlying psychological causes of the Core/Cash divide.

Psychology, Mike.  There's already an outgroup.  So long as there's an outgroup, BCH can stay united by opposing the outgroup.

I think you missed something in your understanding of the problem, though.  Game theory &amp; economics is built out of thousands of individuals making individual decisions which culminates in the group decision.  See your quote here: 

&gt; That was the point where I decided it had all become a waste of my time. The vast majority of mining hash power was controlled by people who were psychologically incapable of disobedience to perceived authority.

You conclude that it's an inability to disobey authority.  I don't think that's true.  From the position of a miner, the choice is much more difficult.  Why did segwit2x die and BCH survive?  Many reasons, of course, but one of the big ones is the difficulty algorithm.  Blockchains punish people who break consensus.  They punish *everyone* when someone breaks consensus, but they punish the minority group much much harder.  If you're a miner who has $200,000 of monthly electricity bills that must be paid no matter what, you can't simply pick the side that you are philosophically in agreement with.  You *must* pick the side that pays the bills.

Similarly, Bitcoin is being punished by the markets for the civil war that split consensus, a punishment that will only grow worse over time.  Blockchains punish all participants for breaks in consensus.",1522942429
The question is does it add to the network and the answer is unless it is a miner it doesn't.  We are talking about the Bitcoin network and not the Lightning Network.  This is the fallacy you are making. You are conflating two completely different networks.,1522942405

The way Corda does this is as follows. When a hard fork equivalent is scheduled (change to the network parameters file) a new version of that file is signed and published in a well known location polled over HTTP. Corda itself doesn't use HTTP, it uses a binary P2P protocol like Bitcoin does, but serving a few control files over HTTP like this means they can be protected by CDNs like Cloudflare or Akamai.

The new file contains a date at which it will take effect. So in that sense it's like what ABC is doing. *But* with a key difference: there is an explicit RPC to accept the new parameters (rules), and nodes advertise which parameters they have accepted. So the people organising the hard fork can watch to see if people are accepting the new parameters or not. If they aren't accepting it quickly enough the date can be pushed back. It's a lot more dynamic than when the date is fully hard coded.

Bitcoin is the world's first electronically tradable liquid asset (ETLA).  Until most people had smart phones with wireless internet, it made no sense for people to use ETLAs as currency.

Now that bitcoin has broken the ice, so to speak, it will allow a market of ETLAs to flourish.

If I could transfer a fractional share of IBM from my phone to yours, or any other company, or share in a basket of commodities chosen to have stable value, and there were an active currency market doing constant price discovery between the most common ETLAs, then I expect those would compete with BTC for use as currency.

I predict that is exactly what's going to happen.  If governments try to prevent non-BTC ETLAs from existing, then the price of BTC will keep going up, punishing the value of fiat currencies until they relent, at which point ETLAs and fiats will compete in an open market.

But but but... let me suspend my disbelief for the sake of argument... if the miners can spam the bitcoin block chain with transactions that fill up the mempool to raise fees... the simple solution is to raise the block size so that the spam transactions get wiped out with each block mined.  It would also cost more and more for miners to keep trying to fill the blocks.. so essentially this line of reasoning would lead me to becoming a big blocker.  

Not only that...but when Lightning Network gets widely adopted as a 2nd layer scaling solution... the 1st level (block chain) layer will still be vulnerable to spam attacks (if you believe spam attacks are real).

"&gt;I believe Bitcoin, in part, attains its value in being the predominant cryptocurrency or ‘gateway’ to the altcoins.

I'm glad you made that distinction. I think a lot of bitcoin's dominance and value is also derived from its popularity. Everything else is considered an alt coin. Its first-mover advantage is paramount and shouldn't be strictly compared to dotcom rise-and-falls such as Myspace. I'm being a hypocrite here because my portfolio is severely lacking in BTC at the moment, but I have great confidence in its ""digital gold"" nickname. I think such popularity combined with attributes like scarcity, liquidity, and security, inherently make it the standard since something has to be.

I used to puzzle over how it got its value (aside from insane mining costs) when people would ask ""Where does bitcoin get its thousands of dollars of value"" or ""Why should I pay thousands for a bitcoin when I can get X Crypto for a fraction of the cost?"" But it clicked one day, and maybe this is a no-brainer. Obviously there's supply/demand, buyers/sellers that set a market price. But you could argue its value is basically intrinsic; the moment fiat is used to purchase it, that's exactly where the value comes from (and again, from other people wanting it). Whether bitcoin is worth 3k, 7k, 20k, or 100k, it means there are buyers still paying that price in fiat for a bitcoin, and it does *not* necessarily mean a buyer paid more than they should have. Even if the market price is 100k, a buyer putting that much into a bitcoin now has the capacity to send a liquid asset over to someone on the other side of the earth pretty quickly and inexpensively. If it was to purchase a product, the recipient would presumably convert to cash in a relatively short amount of time and avoid any disparity in price. Do I wish something like Nano or IOTA could switch roles with bitcoin to make it even quicker and free? Sure, but for now bitcoin has the first-mover advantage and dominance. It will be interesting to see how much of an impact fiat markets for alts has on that number though.",1522941425

"&gt;  Proof of stake is basically, ""the more money you have, the more money you earn."" Please set me straight.

Staking rewards are actually a pretty small part of PoS.  Smaller than block rewards and probably smaller than fee targets should be for a safe blockchain.

Think of it this way.  The entire purpose of proof of work is that we need a method of random participant selection from among the network.  The only reason we need that is because in the event of a double spend, someone, somewhere must decide between the two spends.  Since that ""someone"" could just as well be an ally of the attacker, we need to make sure it is truly random so that the attacker can't select the double spend in such a way that they screw over a recipient.

Sybil attacks complicate the entire process because you aren't dealing with ""people"" online, you're dealing with IP addresses.  Proof of work handily solves both problems for us, and more besides.  Proof of work allows us to randomly select a participant to resolve double spends, it blocks Sybil attacks by consuming real value, it binds the participants to the future valuation of the network, and it allowed for a \**relatively\** fair early distribution of the coins.

Now compare that with a properly done PoS system.  PoS... Allows us to randomly select a participant to resolve double spends, it blocks Sybil attacks by locking up real value inside the system, and it binds the participants to the future valuation of the network at least on a shorter timespan.  It doesn't do early distribution, but we're well past that point in Crypto-Currency now anyway.  It also doesn't bind the random participant selection to *external* value, which is the one ""flaw.""

For that singular, relatively arbitrary flaw the trade off is that the entire system becomes much more efficient.  Node operation can be directly rewarded, as is needed to maintain decentralized diversity of fullnodes.  Economically this becomes better as the network rewards hodling, creating neutral or upward pressure on price, whereas mined PoW coins must be sold to cover real world costs, which creates constant downward pressure on price.  Moreover, the payouts(fees+rewards) required to prevent a 51% attack on a PoS system can be much, much lower than the payouts(fees+rewards) required to prevent a 51% attack on a PoW system, simply because staking is passive, long term, and can be observed with metrics predicting future spikes/changes in staking control.

Of course, then there's the ""long range attack"" or the ""nothing at stake"" problem.  I feel like Ethereum's solution to this is proper and extremely handy - Simply code for such a situation in advance.  It can only happen during syncing and it is extremely expensive to pull off.  In such a situation, simply stop and make the user validate which history is the false history and which is the true history through some external checking, aka, google it or go ask the buddy who told you about Ethereum.  Given the attack's massive costs and very minor potential payoff, that's more than enough to make it infeasible.

tl;dr: Staking rewards are small by design.  The interest rates are lower than what you can get on the stock markets, and can be safely set to even lower payout levels than PoW.",1522941259

"**Occasional British English spelling and terminology (such as the phrase ""bloody hard"") in both source code comments and forum postings led to speculation that Nakamoto, or at least one individual in the consortium claiming to be him, was of Commonwealth origin.[4][6][21] Moreover, the first bitcoin block that could only be mined by Satoshi contains the encoded text The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks which implies that he was reading the London's The Times newspaper at the time of the inception of bitcoin.[22][23]:18

Stefan Thomas, a Swiss coder and active community member, graphed the time stamps for each of Nakamoto's bitcoin forum posts (more than 500); the resulting chart showed a steep decline to almost no posts between the hours of 5 a.m. and 11 a.m. Greenwich Mean Time. (Between 2pm and 8pm Japanese time, an unusual sleep pattern for someone presumably living in Japan) As this pattern held true even on Saturdays and Sundays, it suggested that Nakamoto was asleep at this time.[4]

Nakamoto's initial email to Dai is dated 22 August 2008; the metadata for this PDF (pdftk bitcoin.pdf dump_data) yields as the CreationDate the value 20081003134958-07'00' – this implies 3 October 2008 or a bit over a month later, which is consistent with the local date mentioned in the Cypherpunk mailing list email. This is an earlier draft than the final draft on bitcoin.org, which is dated 20090324113315-06'00' or 24 March 2009; the timezone differs: −7 vs −6.[24]

Gavin Andresen has said of Nakamoto's code: ""He was a brilliant coder, but it was quirky"".[25]**

So taken from the wikipedia article we can see that he used a lot of british terminology. Also not noted above, he used the word Favour not favor which is british spelling. How can we explain this? unless it was deliberate? 

Another thing that interests me is the time zones. so the timezones of the pdf for bitcoin was consistent for California which is where Nick is from but the time of posts on the forums is more consistent with central USA if he went to sleep around 11pm. if he went to sleep earlier it lines up with California again.

Greece can't shut down illegal payments because the government is weak and so is the currency, therefore there is an incentive to have a second currency that doesn't suffer from the same issues the primary currency does.

We can help them. Yet Samson Mow has publicly stayed that he doesn't think Bitcoin is for the poor.",1522940965
I think it's only aimed at advertisements.  Don't get me wrong I'd be happy if they got rid of muppets like Suppoman or the Crypto Oracle (makes me cringe to even write his name) but that could be a  dangerous road to censorship if they started meddling with channels,1522940931

"I don't really think it is horseshit though. The reason we are in a freefall is because people do not understand the difference between the two.

If businesses started using BCH they would find that it DOES work. So if people who have crypto understand that BCH DOES work and that they are being fed propaganda by the other side they might pick up some BCH and ask the vendors they frequent to make the switch.

Which would make crypto useful.

The other issue is that there is NO OTHER CRYPTO that does work. Ethereum has a lot of other baggage on top of everything (and costs more per transaction, and their software won't even work properly half the time, yadda  yadda).

Monero costs a damn fortune to use.

"Ok, I get you. I’m not your enemy here.

I agree BTC has taken some decisions over time that do not seem to be optimum to its speed and adoption, and their devs don’t seem to give value to these issues (which is very odd IMO). It’s sad BCH had to fork, cause now Bitcoin name is tainted and having both projects doesn’t benefit the community and the space, but it’s done now, and I’m not sure we’ll be able to change BTC’s mind.

That being said, I’m not sure it’s worh being so aggressive against them. Maybe focus on BCH more for that matter and time will decide who deserves the Bitcoin name.

Anyway, with these kind of speakers, BTC is not going very far I think and is making BCH arguments very obvious.

"No, a Bitcoin based economy would be the same as the current dollar-based economy. Unfortunately, for that to happen, the Bitcoin would have to be the main currency in your home country. 

Essentially, Bitcoin is treated as any other kind of foreign currency, so you have to account for it the same way you would account for other large foreign currency transactions. Unfortunately, multicurrency accounting isn't something most people in the US (even most small or medium-sized businesses) have had to deal with on a day-to-day basis up until recently because most business in the US is done using *only* US Dollars (so, no need for multicurrency accounting). This is creating a massive amount of confusion on how you have to deal with fluctuations in the currency exchange rate (in the American Bitcoin world, that would be the fluctuation in value of Bitcoin compared to US Dollars) in order to properly account for foreign currency gains and losses.

Multicurrency accounting is complex. And what's worse, most standard accounting programs cannot handle multicurrency accounting properly (even some larger, systems don't handle it properly - again because they were written by people who don't have a good grasp on how multicurrency accounting works). 

Without getting into too much detail on how it works, basically every time you exchange a foreign currency for some value (whether it be other currencies, or whether it be some other asset, or whether it be sunday brunch), you have to account for the difference in value of that unit of currency in comparison to your country's home currency between the time you acquired the currency, and the time you gave it away. That difference is your Realized Currency Exchange Gain or Loss (which is taxed as a capital gain or loss).",1522940610

I suppose I just take a realistic(pessimistic?) view on a lot of things and I feel like there is this narrative that bitcoin is going to set EVERYONE free and it’s just not. There will always be poverty and unethical leaders in this world. I just think it is silly to say that blockstream is killing babies. ",1522940564

"&gt; It's very interesting that you say that. What are the key similarities in your opinion?

* It still uses reddit to coordinate the community.
* There is no formalised governance mechanism. Old Bitcoin used ""rule by obscure IRC chats between Core devs"" and the different Cash nodes coordinate .... how?
* It still uses proof of work and miners still don't care about the health of the network.
* The community still appears somewhat opposed the idea of voting in any kind of formalised governance procedure (e.g. ABC fork is not waiting to see if miners agree, or if users agree, they just picked a time and went for it).

I don't really hang out here anymore so I don't know if other problematic aspects remain ... from a quick search over the forums it seems people don't use terms like ""rule by math"" anymore, which is good. I'm not saying there's been no improvement.

&gt; It is my view that the BOLD action that we should have taken in 2014-15 was to say, ""ok, you guys do your small block thing and we'll do our big block thing."" 

What we wanted was a fork of the chain that would so clearly dominate that the small blockers would give up. The alternative Cash adopted of simply forking the entire ledger permanently, abandoning the brand name, the currency symbol,  the forums, the wallets, the exchanges, *all* the infrastructure was  - at the time - considered inconceivable. It wasn't even suggested.

The community lost a lot in the Cash split. I realise it may seem like a victory of sorts but in effect the big blockers abandoned everything except the code. It is astonishing that this event didn't negatively affect the price, but as noted below this is a double edged sword. It appears that price and utility aren't linked at all and that avoided a crisis during the Cash split but also causes crises of its own.",1522940532

"Let me tell you how strong the SEC is.  I am a U.S. citizen and had a bank account in Europe (Zurich) a few years ago, mostly savings for a rainy day. Everything was going fine for a while, until I got a call from my account rep one day telling me that the bank was closing my account.  Why? New SEC “regulations” that were virtually impossible to comply with.  The regs applies only to U.S. citizens, which meant that we all had to cash out and take our money back “home”.

Sure, other citizens got to keep their accounts, but my point is that the SEC has a very long reach. And if the agency makes it impossible for U.S. citizens to use a currency (like Monero), that’s a huge hit to its adoption. And don’t think the SEC isn’t unscrupulous enough or sufficiently potent to put covert pressure on other governments to kill adoption for their citizens, too.

Think about it: the U.S. government has coerced the entire world into the biggest scam of all: using the fiat disaster known as the dollar as the  word’s reserve currency.  It’s the definition of a shit currency backed by nothing.  It’s Verge on steroids.

They’ve used bullets and blackmail to keep the dollar reserve currency system in place for decades.  Any threat to the system, whether it be Saddam’s Euro-backed oil trade or Qadaffi’s gold-backed dinar, was met with vicious force and, ultimately, murder.  This government will stop at NOTHING to protect dollar hegemony.

And yet some believe that Monero will be allowed to conduct “private” transactions, away from be praying eyes of the U.S. government?  Free from tracking and monitoring?

Ladies and gentlemen, it’s time we stop fooling ourselves.  This entire crypto space is simply one giant experiment that’s being “watched” by the Controllers.  They want to see how the technology progresses, what the kinks are, how adoption takes places, etc.  But don’t think for one minute that any of this will supplant the dollar or any fiat currency.

When the time is right, they will crash the global economy (can you hear the death drums beating now in the Dow and other markets?) and usher in a new, global, “safe”, sovereign crypto, backed by the faith and trust of collective governments and free from the “fraud” of decentralized crypto.

It doesn’t take a genius to see that the banking cartel has already highjacked the crypto market and effectively controls it with futures trading:

https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@supercrypto1/4th-dimension-bitcoin-manipulation-cartel-price-suppression-is-the-goal

The crypto space has been thoroughly compromised, if it wasn’t compromised from it’s inception.


We are pawns.  That doesn’t mean we can’t still make some money as pawns, but I do think that the window is closing, and the opportunities are fading.  Buy Monero, buy ADA, buy LTC, buy TRX — buy whatever the f**k you think has a chance to move big on this next (and probably last) bull run once BTC finally plunges to $3K (or less) and fleeces 80% of the new money that rolled in.

Then take your profits and wait for the Financial Overlords to put their new system in place.  The future isn’t going to be the “exciting” one Common preaches about on that empty stage in that damn Microsoft AI commercial.  It’s going to be one in which we are all better and more obedient bitches to our banking salve owners.

Sorry to be a Debbie Downer, but short of some sort of revolution in the near future, it’s really game over for humanity. Plan accordingly.

"Yes. It's easy to do a permissionless network on top of Corda. Just release the private root authority signing key to the world :-) 

You'd have a few problems if you did that but they are the same problems Bitcoin faces. People could duplicate identities. Under the hood Corda uses public keys to identify entities, just like Bitcoin, but *people* don't. You can't memorise 256 bit points on an elliptic curve, at least not without training in memory techniques like Roman Room. That's why we did BIP 70, so you could prove ownership of a Bitcoin address in a reliable and secure way. If BIP 70 had been widely adopted by the community it would have avoided [this 1.8 million dollar hack](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitpay-hacked-for-over-18-million-in-bitcoins).

Another problem is how to decide what the network parameters are. In Corda zones the answer is, the signing authority for the zone signs a new parameter ""epoch"". And how do they decide what to sign - well, for the main Corda network it's through a classical governance process. If you released the signing key anyone could sign and then it'd be up to individuals to convince other individuals to install the parameters into their node - just like upgrading to a new Bitcoin node to accept a hard fork.

The hard part is the network map. All the Corda APIs work in terms of identities. You don't use broadcast in Corda, instead you send data directly point to point. It gives better privacy for obvious reasons but you need some notion of identity to do that, even if it's just IP address. Corda is open source though. You could create a Bitcoin style `addr` broadcast mechanism to compile network maps.

Note that you can be decentralised without a Bitcoin style network. It's a spectrum. Is the web decentralised? Is email? They both rely on DNS. What about Tor? They have a cabal of seven developers who can kick users out of the network.

It's a subtle issue.

&gt; What are you thoughts about Corda nodes (banks) issuing FIAT tokens, opposed to central banks ? It would then produce non-fongible tokens right, as we need to trust the issuing bank ?

My thoughts are that this is the first CorDapp ever written (by me). Check out the app here:

First they say deal with crypto at your own risk 
Then they say, we still need taxes on the risk you took on your own

I think they need fiat in their banks to survive or else the banks may collapse.",1522939979
"Before I continue, do you or do you not hold any crypto whatsoever?  If so, why?  If not, why are you here?",1522939958
"Adoption doesn't necessarily have to be a replacement for FIAT currency as many people who come from an economic background seem to think (I don't know what your background is).

The actual fiat price of cryptocurrencies as many are intended to be used will remain irrelevant to the average consumer in the event of actual adoption, as they will only serve as temporary intermediaries to complete a transaction based on the terms given in a smart contract.  The buyer will likely still spend FIAT and the seller will recieve FIAT as the actual crypto transaction is completed in a fraction of a second.  The only fluctuation in FIAT prices the consumer will notice is the cost of the transaction fees and this is where FIAT value becomes relevant, as cryptocurrencies will enable 'anyone' with a computer to become an intermediary replacing banks by mining or hosting nodes and then being paid for doing so by the network.  While there are also many other uses for blockchain and cryptocurrencies this is I believe the 'closest' we are getting to a use case replacing FIAT currencies any time soon.

However some people will realise that by buying tokens at the right time and using those instead they can 'save' money on their transactions without the recipient recieving anything less.

While I see your point, and I'm not saying that it's not a valid argument I think you're overly weighted to one perspective.  And I disagree with your conclusion and final sentiment. It's a shame you're getting downvoted though because I agree, it's not healthy for these communities to be blindly optimistic and overly religious about blockchain and crypto.",1522939901
"Can you give me one reason why you would need two different cryptos? In other words, what can another crypto do that Bitcoin can't that makes it worthwhile to create all these exchanges that are centralized as gatekeepers from one to another.

ie; I have Crypto 1, you have Crypto 2. I want to pay you but you only accept Crypto 2. I must now go to a third party who gets to know who we are AND takes a cut in order for me to make the exchange.

VS. I have crypto 1 and you have crypto 1. I pay you directly and we're done. 

Secondly, the very notion that 'many cryptos' will be under 'one king' suggests that there will be 'a king' which is a centralized head of power and completely against the very notion of Bitcoin and the only real value of cryptocurrencies in the first place.

"Well, with bigger blocks, you need more data to store every transaction that's ever happened, and more internet bandwidth to shuffle the blocks around the internet.  Visa has a peak rate of 65K transactions, bitcoin can do about 3 right now.  65K is a peak rate that's probably never hit in practice, so let's say eventually we need to handle an average of about 10K... that means the nodes are adding ~3GB of storage every 10 minutes, and all of that data is getting transferred around the entire network.  That's not infeasible, but it's also considerable, and will likely price out smaller individual nodes.  Of course, the counterpoint is that bitcoin mining is already very centralized, so...

This severely limits the users of the currency, as its only purpose would be for illegal means. It means no legal wallets, or legal exchanges. So no, they cannot directly shut it down, but if the four main markets got together and outlawed cryptocurrency, then it would be fucked, and solely used on the dark net. 

Worst case scenario for Bitcoin would be for USA, China, EU, UK, Japan to ban its use. Force all exchanges to move servers. Massive loss of mining power, as people flock to other cryptos.

"It has no native cryptocurrency so there is no ICO.

Corda is a system and not a coin, so it is not tradeable on exchanges.

It's designed to be as decentralised as possible without sacrificing the other requirements that industrial and financial users need. For example, all business-to-business transactions take place between identified entities, so every Corda node has an identity issued by some ""authority"". This authority can be compound, and the ""identity"" can be e.g. a random number, a reddit username or whatever else, but for the Corda network we plan to create it'll be legal name - because that's what exists in the heads of the business users we are building it for. That introduces some centralisation, but it's not very much (the authority here doesn't see your transactions, or know what apps you run, or control your business activity) and it's worth it to get other things.

It is difficult to make a direct comparison of decentralisation until our network is up and running. The primary bottleneck is the consensus mechanism in any DLT/blockchain system. Corda is un-opinionated about what algorithm you should use here because there is, as of 2018, no one-size-fits-all solution unfortunately. 

One difficulty in this space is that decentralisation usually costs performance and many customers have heard all about how ""blockchains don't scale"" (gee, thanks Core) and insist on a system that can go at arbitrary but very high speeds before they will consider it. The usual bar is 1000 transactions per second and if you can't do that you won't be considered. There are BFT algorithms that can go that fast, but BFT consensus was an area that received very little attention before Bitcoin, so some of them aren't open source and others are immature. We have an implementation using the BFT-SMaRT library in the Corda git repository, but some initial customers want speed and don't care much about decentralisation, others want decentralisation and are willing to sacrifice performance. Corda can do both, but to do both in the same network, to the same level of robustness and production maturity, is an interesting challenge.

No your probabilities are wrong. ""Chances of SM of finding the next block = Chances of SM finding the next block in honest mining scenario - the chances of SM's blocks getting orphaned."". So SM and HM are at the same height and F is the probability that SM finds a block before HM. It's just F(sm) = α. What is that 'chance of getting orphaned' doing there? The chance is (1-α), it's already accounted for!

"I'll believe it when these concepts are not hidden behind contrived jargon and complex multivariable equations. Peter and Emin are ivory-towering their arguments, making accusations against challengers, and essentially declaring victory through elitism - immediately discrediting their position to me in the process. This is the *precise same behavior* that turned me away from SegWit: it was being ivory-towered and when people pointed out plainly that SegWit transactions have a different security model, they were attacked or discredited, and the fundamental point - that SegWit is less secure - went ""assumed as false"". But what I find most disturbing is that **these are the same discussions held on bitcoin talk seven years ago when Satoshi was around.** This is the same technique: discredit Satoshi's design and you get a free pass to change it. Yet Satoshi's design is not in need of altering; measures to prevent selfish mining are capable of rendering a coin totally dysfunctional and should not be undertaken on a whim (or on the order of an ivory tower intellectual).

THIS IS A SIMPLE SYSTEM WITH A SIMPLE MODEL.

It is very easy for the ""smart people"" to overcomplicate a model. I'm a smart person and I do it *all the damn time*. The Peter/Emin model reeks of overcomplicated and just doesn't pass the smell test.

Let a(H) be the probability of miner H producing a block.  

Therefore, 1-a(H) is the probability of not producing the next block.  

If a miner withholds a block that he has produced, he has a(H) chance of securing an additional block on top of it. Thus, there is an a(H)^2 chance that the withholding miner will find, withhold, find, and subsequently produce the next network-seen block (and continue withholding a *single* block to maintain his perceived competitive edge).

When the block is being held, there is still a 1-a(H) chance that competitor will produce a block. *When this happens, he is now forced to either abandon the block he withheld, or get lucky*: there is a 1-a(H) chance that the following block will permanently orphan his withheld and competing block, but there is an a(H) chance that he will orphan the longest visible chain and retain his control. This applies no matter how deep withheld chains are: if the selfish miner has withheld three blocks and the honest miners have produced three, he is in *precisely the same spot*. So extending the single-release schedule to withhold a longer chain does nothing to improve the odds [in fact, these chains are harder to produce: for an n-chain of withholding, the odds of it being produced unchallenged are a(H)^(n)].

For *all* a(H) &lt; 0.5, a(H) &lt; 1-a(H) *and* a(H)^(n) [where n&gt;0] &lt; 0.5. Therefore, selfish mining has less odds of success than honest mining unless the selfish miner has majority hashpower. Yes, it really is this simple: *past results do not affect future results*. Having found and withheld a block doesn't improve or degrade the chances of finding a block. The selfish miner's odds don't change simply because his broadcast strategy does. Withholding a single block doesn't give him an edge against a propagated block; his withheld block would at best *compete with* the honestly mined chain. The only way the selfish miner can confirm a withheld block is by himself, since no other miner has seen it to confirm it. So the odds of confirmation of his withheld blocks are *de facto* lower than the odds of confirmation of published blocks, to put it a different way.

Overcomplication and analysis of ""what if a longer counterchain"" is unnecessary. *The selfish miner, upon having produced a longest withheld chain, can immediately release one block - this is, in fact, the only way the selfish miner can ever produce a block that will reliably become the main chain!* 

Yes, I've read all the papers. They're overcomplicating a simple question: what are the odds of a block-withholding attack succeeding? This question was answered by Satoshi in 2010, and his answer was ""the same as the odds of that miner producing a valid block at all"". There is no need to calculate the infinite ways in which a selfish miner loses, because they are all duplicates of the same instace: the selfish miner was outhashed on a block, as is to be expected with the observed odds of 1-a(H) [&gt; 0.5].

The price of the token is likely to rise with adoption for several reasons: sentiment, increased volume, decreased supply as market makers hold reserves for increased liquidity...
&gt;And if there weren’t any early investors in the space would any government even be looking at it?
Probably, yes, but not in the same way. The technology can be useful without a native asset (see Ripple) but can be made even better when there is a native asset to that  has a high velocity (see Ripple and Stellar), in fact the trading of these cryptos for speculative purposes is helpful for the ecosystem because it allows for higher liquidity (i.e. easier to quickly exchange one asset for another using the crypto as a bridge currency)",1522938637

"
&gt;Hard forking is an implementation mechanism, not a governance mechanism. Governance is a process, and often an institution, for arriving at a decision. A hard fork is just the software event that makes it real.

A hard fork represents a devolved decision making process.

Anyone in line with the fork accepts the upgrade.

Anyone who disagrees may opt to follow the original chain.

If enough people disagree with the fork, then the fork fails or the chain splits.

That's governance.

&gt;I note with some alarm that Bitcoin Cash is planning a timed hard fork in just one month, with no attempt to measure support or whether people are ready or even agree. 

That's like saying ""there's going to be a vote on the new government and we don't even know if people are going to elect the guys we want.""

&gt; Multiple competing implementations is what we tried with Bitcoin XT and it didn't work.

I'd like to think that BCH is the community of people who understand why that was, and that will make all the difference, but time will tell.

By the time XT was released, someone had already renamed ""Bitcoin qt"" to ""Bitcoin Core"" to emphasize that it was the ""central repo"" of Bitcoin development. I don't remember whose idea that was, but I think it was part of a critical misunderstanding that Bitcoin needed a technical leadership team and Core would be it.

 BCH doesn't have a reference implementation, there is no ""Core group,"" and a lot of us will fight the centralization of development tooth and nail or exit if we fail.  I think that's a very important difference.

"To whatever authority presented itself. In Bitcoin there is no state. So instead, the core developers became the authority.

I don't know if you were around back then, but there were a few moments that crystallised this for me.

The first was when we (myself and Gavin) launched Bitcoin XT. This made the news and there was a TV segment on Bloomberg. I was speaking at a conference in Sweden at the time so I couldn't take part and wasn't sure I wanted to anyway. Instead they ended up with a Core supporter on their talking heads panel. The main reason cited by the Core supporter for why he was opposed to Bitcoin XT was that ""the Core developers have PhDs and neither Mike nor Gavin do"". In fact the people they were referring to had PhDs in irrelevant subjects like computer graphics, and none had any experience of scaling consumer online services - whereas via Google I had plenty. But Google doesn't award PhDs so the value of that experience was zeroed out.

This exchange sums up the mentality many had at the time: Bitcoin is *complex*, therefore it can only be understood by *experts*, therefore I should obey the instructions of experts even if they may superficially appear to be nonsense. But I am *not* an expert so how can I decide who is or is not an expert? I must rely on *proxies*, proxies like academic credentials, or whether their ideas sound clever when they speak, or whether other people who seem to be experts are agreeing with them.

These signals are all heuristics and rules of thumb and as such all trivially gamed by people who understand psychology. Some people may remember the moment when suddenly lots of small blockers started calling themselves Dr This and Dr That. They had always had PhDs but never felt the need to use their titles before, but suddenly they all started doing so. You will also remember the loud insistence that ""consensus"" mattered and that bypassing the ""consensus of experts"" was a nasty trick that Gavin and I were trying to do, because we were in the minority (no citation offered). 

W.R.T. the miners specifically I called some of them via Skype before I decided to leave. One or two refused point blank to talk to me. One miner said he supported me, but couldn't be seen to do so in case it hurt the price. Another conversation went like this:

&gt; Miner: ""We agree the block size should be raised and we agree Core is not going to do so.""
&gt;
&gt; Me: ""Great! So when will you start running XT?""
&gt;
&gt; Miner: ""We aren't going to run XT.""
&gt;
&gt; Me: ""Er, but you just said you agree with our policies and don't think Core will come around.""
&gt;
&gt; Miner: ""Yes, we agree that you are right, but we will never run anything except Core. To do that would be to leave the consensus.""
&gt;
&gt; Me: ""So - if everyone thinks like you do, and refuses to run anything except Core, then the maintainer of Core is effectively the CEO of Bitcoin. So what makes Bitcoin different to PayPal? How is that decentralised""

There was a long silence at this point as if the miner had never considered this before. And eventually he just said, ""We can't run XT, that'd be crazy. We will wait for Core to change their minds.""

That was the point where I decided it had all become a waste of my time. The vast majority of mining hash power was controlled by people who were psychologically incapable of disobedience to perceived authority.",1522937661

&gt;My view is that Bitcoin Cash strongly resembles the Bitcoin community of 2014. This is not good. That experiment was tried and it didn't work.

It's very interesting that you say that. I personally don't agree. What are the key similarities in your opinion?

&gt;*  The Ethereum guys already answered this question and are making plans to abandon it.

I think that's an interesting opinion too.  Proof of work allows for innovation and competition. Proof of stake is basically, ""the more money you have, the more money you earn."" Please set me straight.

&gt;* a tyranny of whoever could impose their will the most aggressively.

I have an opinion on that too :)

Unfortunately when the aggressors showed up, we attempted to take them on head-on (ie XT) instead of simply splitting the currency early. Back then there was an insane amount of FUD surrounding a coin split, with some people asserting it was ""impossible"" or that it would definitely, absolutely devalue the coin. Since then we've have two major coin splits and the data is clear: when a community is sufficiently divided, splitting the coin is an economically efficient, win-win outcome that raises the value of the entire ecosystem.

It is my view that the BOLD action that we should have taken in 2014-15 was to say, ""ok, you guys do your small block thing and we'll do our big block thing."" Imagine if the split had happened years earlier, we wouldn't be here now I don't think.",1522937655

ENG is my third biggest hold and even I was shocked at the run it had. Literally double ETH value in a week. Was a nice kick buying more at 0.00225 ETH. ,1522937179

"Indeed. Coordination was rather handwaved away as a problem that could be solved through the block chain itself. The white paper says:

&gt;  Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.

So Satoshi understood that his invention could be generalised, but didn't do so.

Perhaps the top priority for the Bitcoin Cash community should be to find a replacement for reddit. It doesn't have to be fully peer to peer or decentralised, but a forum which had a different approach to community moderation might be a help. For example, no downvoting allowed, and some limits on the power of moderators and admins.

In hindsight I wonder if it was so hard to predict. Nobody *did* predict it so in some trivial sense it was hard. But if you look at the history of anarchic communities - which Bitcoin certainly was and to some extent still is - they don't stay anarchic for long. Someone always seizes power. Nature abhors a power vacuum. By refusing to fill that vacuum with systems, it was perhaps inevitable that it would be filled by individuals instead.

"Eh. Surely it's a big player in the world economy, but even if the dollar plummeted tomorrow, internal economies for BRIC countries and Eurozone would still hold. EU-US trade is ~1Trillion USD per year, with EU being the first market for US goods and services. US is the second market for EU.

EU economy is worth ~18 Trillion USD per year, so losing the US (assuming the US is totalled by whatever factor, i.e. dollar worth nothing) would be a big hit for sure, and would put the economy in a recession, but not bigger than 2007-2009 recession (around 2 trillion USD of money burnt to bailout banks plus the domino effect). 

BRIC would probably switch to gold-backed Yuan for international transactions, and Euro for EU transactions. 

I mean, even if the US declared total bankruptcy tomorrow, the world would survive.

That's why I believe in crypto for the long term - an algorithm backed currency is superior to a gold backed currency. What if tomorrow SpaceX hails an asteroid worth 300Trillion USD in Gold? They'd own the world. Crypto will eventually guarantee that no external factor can impact trade.

Calling it a 'data limit' is still more accurate than calling it a transaction limit.

&gt; I agree it's data that is being limited but I cant ignore that it is the single limiting factor for the number of transactions.

It's a limiting **factor** in the number of **confirmed** transactions in a given ~10 minute period of time to what can fit in the block. But it is a just a factor for confirmation time and not an actual transaction limit.

Unless you are going to argue that the only 'real' transactions are those that are confirmed, but nobody talks like that (especially engineers), and we can have 0conf transactions.

"No. The causes were complex and essentially psychological. Let's say that the miners didn't behave in the way they should, and nor did most of the community, and that left an opening that a small minority of developers were able to exploit to take it over.

In such a situation, who is at fault? Was the problem the weakness of the community? Or those who exploited it? Or both?

The most critical problem for cryptocurrency in general is that Bitcoin's design rests on three assumptions that have been invalidated:

1. The price of the currency will be proportional to utility.
2. Miners are economically rational actors who will maximise utility because they want to maximise the price.
3. The other participants in the system are also economically rational and will evaluate decisions based on what's best for the long term.

In fact the price went up even as the utility of the system collapsed, due to any utility signal being swamped by speculative capital, and miners turned out to be economically irrational - their primary desire was to follow orders, not maximise their long term returns. I spent *significant* amounts of time trying to persuade miners to raise the block size limit towards the end of 2015 and they refused to do so because they were terrified of anything that might be perceived as disobedience to authority. We can debate what the cause of that is - at the time I wondered if it was related to China being a communist dictatorship - but ultimately western miners were not much better.

To understand the root causes of all this you must read Sowell. It isn't optional. ""A Conflict Of Visions"" explains why societies split into two camps that fight each other, again and again. We normally recognise this in the context of national politics as left wing vs right wing, but in the Bitcoin community this same conflict arose as Big vs Small Blockers, in Ethereum as Classic vs Original, in Russia as Red vs White, and in the UK in recent years it has been Leave vs Remain. All these conflicts are typified by the same characteristics:

* Bitter, enduring conflicts between two opposing camps of roughly equal size who can never make up.
* Very different attitudes towards perceived experts, intellectuals, towards academic qualifications etc.
* A win-at-any-cost mentality by one of the camps.
* Different views on the validity of the preferences of the majority / ""will of the people"" etc.

The reason they are so similar is because they share the same root cause, a root cause that traces to a disagreement about the span of human nature. Societies split into two camps because ultimately the underlying disagreement is over a unidimensional variable, so disagreement runs along a 1-dimension spectrum.

These conflicts cannot be avoided but they can be contained and channelled. If the Bitcoin community doesn't establish systems for containing this conflict it will arise again over some issue that appears superficially different to the block size debate, but underneath looks much the same.",1522935360

Anyone with an educated guess how much crypto volume **actually** comes from India? (*no India is a shithole anyways comments please*).,1522935294
"GROUND BREAKING:

Coinbase tweeted they are to offer a series of alts on their platform Binance have announced they are looking to facilitate direct fiat purchase of alts. Bitfinex have gone a step further and actually listed a series of alts they are to list with the ability to invest via direct fiat purchase.

I believe Bitcoin, in part, attains its value in being the predominant cryptocurrency or ‘gateway’ to the altcoins. For example generally, newbies go on coinbase and purchase their Bitcoin with a debit card, with their freshly purchased Bitcoin they then transmit the bitcoin to Kucoin and invest in altcoins. I know it is a rough and ready example but the trend is:

FIAT to BITCOIN to ALTCOIN. (I am aware they may also use LTC or ETH but we all know Bitcoin reigns king of the gateway).

So, considering the above I expect in the coming months Bitcoin will continue to lose value. How much value ? I do not know. I will use my intuition as the days unfold to speculate a personal re-entry point.

Importantly, this is just my opinion. There is every likelihood I am wrong – I mean my theory is broad but the intracaices that dicatae a market are subtle.

I still believe Bitcoin will remain the number one crypto for a long while, but considering what I have just explained it is indicative a lot of the impetus in crypto currency will be channelled by the exchanges themselves.

I also think having spoken with many people they all agree it is hurdle investing in crypto currency (via the means of the Coinbase example above). I truly believe we will see a big wave of newbies entering the market once the process of investing in crypto becomes slicker.

"Are there still people so delusional they think BTC can suddenly go on a ""huge climb""?

Firstly Bittrex doesn’t do major volume in fact it is a relatively small exchange. For now it just means less noobs will loose money on alts. Bitfinex and Korean and Japanese exchanges are the major Bitcoin movers in this space. All these other insignificant exchanges that keep getting hacked and closing only have psychological effects on the bitcoin price.,1522935201

Because for people to use Bitcoin instead of the local currency and credit cards, it must be economically advantageous to do so.

"Ok, did you read that? It has a valid point that you wouldn’t totally dismiss the history, and explain vehemently why Bitcoin Cash is ‘in’ this position, but it in no way suggests to wallow in it, or to use the deficiencies of another platform as your only positive.  At best, it mean the history and horrible process that occurred should be ‘a’ talking point, but if it’s your go to point, if it’s what you keep slipping back to like a guy that can’t quit talking about his ex, then that’s where you’re going to be stuck for a long time.  You don’t have to whitewash anything that’s happened, but if you think the only merit Bitcoin Cash has, and the only way it can move up is based on however far it can pull core ‘down’, then you’re banking on the wrong attributes.

As a guess, I would say you feel Bitcoin ‘core’ is riding the network effect, and that even though it is objectively worse, that people continue to use it out of convenience, and those are ‘your’ users, and until you get them, you’re at this tremendous disadvantage.  But trying to get them by vilifying the thing they’re using or comfortable with will win you a certain kind of convert, but not the kind you need.  It’s like religion, you can try to convert people by telling them they’re going to hell if they don’t believe, or by showing them how content and blessed they would be if they do.

"Blockchain is not cloud based. In fact, it's the opposite of cloud/server based. It's a peer-to-peer database. It exists on every peer/node.

Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer currency. It runs without a server - the centralized party. No party alone decides the rules in Bitcoin. The rules are decided by the network, i.e., the consensus of all nodes.

In order to prevent spamming, there is a 1MB blocksize limit. It has been in Bitcoin for ages. Since more and more people start to use Bitcoin, the limit becomes a bottleneck. To solve the scaling problem, SegWit utilizes a smart engineering approach so that the *effective* blocksize limit size becomes 4MB without breaking the old 1MB blocksize limit rule. The new *effective* limit uses the term ""weight"".

There has been a war between SegWit and direct blocksize limit increase, which is another way of scaling. In a nutshell, SegWit is superior in almost every way. Direct blocksize limit increase is not only inferior but also dangerous because it makes Bitcoin centralized, which is the only way to kill it. Direct blocksize limit increase and its derivatives, such as Bcash, aka ""Bitcoin Cash"", are pushed by corrupt miners and enemies of Bitcoin.",1522934565

For Corda's first 18 months or so, we released incompatible prototypes every month. This was great for prototyping and getting feedback, but our users could barely keep up.

We've now committed to API and wire (protocol) stability, since the 3.0 release. We're now releasing a few times a year, maybe a bit more. Over time I expect our release process to steadily slow down. If you look at a really huge and successful platform like Java, historically they released every 3-4 years or so and it's still very common to hear about people running versions 10 years out of date. Windows has the same problem.

Maybe you can get away with a one month upgrade cycle for now, because Bitcoin Cash is very backwards compatible. But it's worth considering how frequently you want to do these hard forks. Organisations with money on the line don't like to touch things. This is one reason miners didn't behave as we expected/hoped they would.",1522934314
"I absolutely sold the top.  I also sold so,e when my stake more than doubled which was way before the top.  I also sold on the way back down and have hardly any bitcoin left.  When an investment you make has spectacular returns in a short timeframe it is smart to bring some back and not expect it to keep going up at that exponential rate.  You don’t have to sell it all, just sell some.  It improves your cost basis and you can still ride the upside.  Likewise if something starts dumping but is still above your cost basis you can sell some.  Each time we had a large bounce I sold some.  If I had just held I would still be up but no where near what I pulled off with this simple strategy.  If you want to just be a hodler that is cool but there are definitely different strategies that can work out too.  I’m playing very safe from here.  I only grab a small stake if we seriously dump.  We hit 6100 I’m buying.  ",1522934309

"No. Corda has no native cryptocurrency. It's an app platform a bit like Ethereum, so you can create coins on top by writing an app for it.

The most useful kinds of tokens for businesses are proxies for deposits of fiat held elsewhere (or are central bank balances), so Corda comes with an example ""finance"" app that implements demos of cash, commercial paper, interest rate swaps and a few other things. A cash app that can be deployed for real is more work and involves a lot of legal and regulatory work.

You could implement a Satoshi-style limited inflation no-backing currency on Corda. I've thought about how to do it before. But I never wrote down the details anywhere.

One consequence of this is that the miner-equivalents (notaries) can charge users in any way they like. They aren't restricted to using a native token. That has pluses and minuses that we're still exploring. Perhaps in future we'll introduce a Corda-native cryptocurrency. I personally still like the idea.

"Segwit was a blocksize increase to a theoretical max of about 4MB.  Basically we store the transaction data and separate the signatures of segwit blocks.  If the entire block is standard segwit transactions then it could get up to about 4MB.  

The blockweight is based on the transaction part of the block.  Segwit transactions are about 25% the size in the transaction part of the block so the fees are cheaper.

This was done as a transaction malleability fix.  Transaction malleability needed to be fixed so that we could have better more reliable smart contracts.  If your contract was dependent on a tx ID and another tx id could remove the funds you're counting on then you're in for a bad day.  It also allows for watchtower in lightning which is awesome. 

The real reason that the show runners of bitcoin cash Ver and Jihan object to segwit is because it makes covert ASICBOOST no longer covert and no longer really doable with blocks with segwit transactions.

Craig Wright explicitly said it would be great if bitcoin was ran by corps and governments.  In his talk he used the shifting sands approach.  It was a short talk 26 minutes but took a good hour or so to get through it and really dig into all his sudden changes in context and terminology.  For example most people think about Bitcoin and safe transactions when they are included in blocks and he was talking about zero conf tx for a lot of his talk but never explicitly said he was talking about zero conf so that's why Joesph Poon was like your entire talk made no sense.  He'd also conflate terms like packet, block, and transaction.  He only really went into la la land towards the end when he talked about lightning.   Bcashers talk about a routing problem that doesn't exist.  We have networks that route ... it's the internet ... we have TOR... Is it perfectly efficient perhaps not, but it doesn't matter.     Solving all the private keys in existence has nothing to do with routing.  His entire talk was designed to sound educational and have some verifiable aspects a non-technical person could verify against and get them to the point where they would feel they understand the topic, but in reality they have no fucking clue.

Actually, no. There are zero Bitcoin transactions occurring to exchange goods and services. The only Bitcoin transactions occurring are buying and selling other currencies.

&gt; Yours is a ridiculous standard.
It's the only standard that counts. Till a commodity that people want is sold only in Bitcoin, nobody is going to really need Bitcoin. That is how currency exchange rates work. Demand and supply. People acquire USD because they want to buy commodities sold only in USD in the United States. The market value of USD goes up. If the United States economy tanks and goods/service production slows down, fewer people will need USD to pay for these goods/services and the USD market value will fall.

My view is that Bitcoin Cash strongly resembles the Bitcoin community of 2014. This is not good. That experiment was tried and it didn't work. It's tempting to think that what happened was a freak one-off occurrence, but I don't think it was. I think it was inevitable given the structure and psychological profile of the community at the time. So just trying to ""get back on track"" as I see it, is nowhere near radical enough.

If I could get one message across to you in this session it's this: *be bold*. Be willing to accept that what happened was not just bad luck. Liberate yourselves from just proceeding along the path Satoshi imagined and be willing to think radical, even heretical thoughts.

Here are some questions to reflect on as a community together:

* Does Bitcoin need to use Script? If it swapped out the VM and scripting system for something better, would it still be Bitcoin?
* Does Bitcoin need to use proof-of-work? If it stopped using proof-of-work one day, would it still be Bitcoin? The Ethereum guys already answered this question and are making plans to abandon it.
* Does Bitcoin need to use its current protocol at all? If *all* the technical aspects of Bitcoin changed, leaving *only* the monetary policy and existing coin balances, would it still be Bitcoin?

and

* Does Bitcoin need a Foundation or some other form of formalised governance? We tried to make one years ago and it failed due to a mix of rum characters and opposition from people who felt it was ""centralisation"", who maybe didn't realise that the alternative was not structurelessness but rather a tyranny of whoever could impose their will the most aggressively.

"Nodes are all fully validating in Corda. If you receive a transaction your node downloads the entire dependency graph and runs the contract code (scripts) for every transaction, checking all the signatures along the way. So you're sure the final result is a valid transaction.

Now there may be a double spend, but that's what the notary signatures tell you. If you trust that group of consensus forming nodes (notary) - and we hope you do because that group is probably using a BFT algorithm, so some of them can be malicious and the result is still correct - then you get the same guarantees as Bitcoin full nodes provide.

This may seem initially quite different to Bitcoin but it's actually not. In Bitcoin if you don't trust the miners collectively then you cannot rule out the existence of double spends that were re-org'd out of the chain. And although in theory proof-of-work scales better than most BFT algorithms do, in practice due to ASICs and China what we see is that it takes so few corrupt miners to break proof-of-work that in reality almost any BFT group will be stronger.

"Yes, I'm afraid I think there's a lot to do and that's one reason I agreed to do this. Some things are being overlooked. If history repeated itself that would be a crying shame.

Hard forking is an implementation mechanism, not a governance mechanism. Governance is a process, and often an institution, for arriving at a decision. A hard fork is just the software event that makes it real.

I note with some alarm that Bitcoin Cash is planning a timed hard fork in just one month, with no attempt to measure support or whether people are ready or even agree. The content is not going to controversial in this community now, but a lot of organisations would find it hard to schedule and test a software upgrade on one month's notice. There's a risk that miners who do upgrade will be split onto a minority chain by accident even if everyone intends to upgrade, and have to roll back, making them even more conservative than they already are.

Governance was one of the causes of the split and so needs the most analysis and change. But I'm afraid I'm not seeing that at the moment. Multiple competing implementations is what we tried with Bitcoin XT and it didn't work. Ultimately the internet is a lawless place, and a sufficiently committed group will always be able to wipe out any nodes they disagree with to prevent people from expressing their opinions. Formalised governance mechanisms can help avoid this by coordinating a group decision in ways that can't be so trivially attacked, and if you look at Ethereum, they have the Ethereum Foundation and other ways to do it. I think that would help a lot.

It seems the miners seem to be mostly supportive of Bitcoin Cash (with the exception of Slushpool) and openly write positive things about it. It seems to only be Bitcoin Core / Blockstream who are against it.

"Corda uses a similar transaction format to Bitcoin, with inputs and outputs linked by SHA2, but it doesn't use proof-of-work. As a consequence it doesn't need blocks and as a consequence of that there actually is no chain of blocks in Corda (there are chains of transactions). That's why we sometimes call it ""DLT"" for ""distributed ledger technology"" instead of a blockchain.

So in the context of Corda it doesn't make sense to ask if it scales on-chain or off-chain. The answer is you get a lot of the properties of off-chain systems (scalability, privacy etc) with the good bits of being ""on-chain"": interested parties can neutrally verify the existence and validity of transactions.

The tech white paper explains this is more detail but briefly, imagine Bitcoin running in a mode where the broadcast logic was disabled, and where nobody was finding any blocks. If someone wanted to pay you in such a network they would need your IP address, and they would send you an `inv` packet with the hash of the payment transaction. Your node would look at the inputs and discover it was missing some, so it'd do a `getdata` in response to fetch those transactions. Then it'd look at their inputs in turn and do the same thing recursively until it bottomed out the dependency graph at transactions that were found in the block chain. 

Corda works something like that. Conflict (double spend) detection is handled by clusters of nodes that run some sort of consensus algorithm between themselves and can sign with multi-sig keys. For instance you could have a cluster using PBFT or similar, with 10-20 different parties, and they'd collectively sign each transaction to assert ""there are no double spends of this transaction"".

When double spends are resolved by checking a threshold signature of a separate group of consensus-forming nodes, this has a number of useful consequences:

* No more energy-expensive mining.
* Transactions no longer need to be broadcast to everyone. They're only seen by either parties that are involved, or parties that are involved in a transaction that depends on this one. So whilst you can still end up downloading transactions that are nothing to do with you, how much this occurs depends on the connectedness of the dependency graph. For many applications that aren't coins the connectedness is quite low so this is a huge win.
* Because only the consensus group (we call these things notaries) needs to see all transactions, low powered Corda nodes can still be fully validating and useful. So scalability is a lot better.
* Transactions have finality.
* You can avoid the various annoying probabilities and race conditions that make programming with a gossip network  tricky.

It has some downsides too. Satoshi went with PoW because he wanted a consensus algorithm with unidentified participants and no join or exit procedure. Corda doesn't provide that.

Nodes in a Corda network have a long term identity key and a name. To find them you consult a directory service called the network map. It's the same as Tor in that respect. In the same way that the Tor operators can kick nodes out of their network by removing them from the directory, so too can Corda nodes be removed (or blocked from joining) by the operators of the network map.

Corda has this concept of ""zones"" which are basically like networks or alt coins in bitcoin. They're totally independent systems and because Corda is open source, anyone can create a zone with its own rules. Also each zone has its own network map. So mainnet would be a zone, testnet would be a zone, an alt-coin that only changed a few things like name/port numbers/inflation schedule would be a zone. You don't need to fork the software to create alternative zones, there's a file called the ""network parameters"" with all the things you can tweak about a network/zone without needing to edit the source code. There's also a system for evolving these parameters, and that's our equivalent of hard forks. The set of allowed notaries (which are in turn intended to be composed of mutually distrusting nodes) is set in the network map.

So this is a more structured design than Bitcoin with a more formalised notion of governance. We're setting up a zone which we hope will become the default zone for business, and the current thinking revolves around a written constitution and a Foundation-like governance process. But the details aren't announced yet.

The result of all of this is that Corda scales a lot better than Bitcoin, but for payment networks Bitcoin could scale to the required levels with a lot of work anyway without such major design changes.",1522931707

&gt;Quote me the part in Emin's paper where he says SM tries to catch up, just like I quoted you the part where he says SM doesn't try to catch up.

I never said that the miner tries to catch up *in the original strategy*. However, there are *optimal strategies*, where he does (see the second and third paper that I've linked).

&gt;And again no, SM cannot try to catch up if he has less hashpower it's basic common sense.

He can and it does make sense. He cannot be certain to catch up and the probability to catch up is quite low, but if the return is high enough, the expectation is high enough, too, even if the probability is low.

With stocks, the laymen can't access the market directly, it has to go through brokers (for some fucked up reason besides making it more difficult to trade yourself). With crypto, you are your own broker. This is a fundamental difference. Put that together with tether and the significant lower fees crypto has, and you can't compare the two. That and blockchain tech and owning a coin isn't the same as a company and owning stocks. Even if the devs of let's say ether stop their work, the either network in theory would live on and with it being open sourced (an extremely important one), new players could work on it too.

Thanks for visiting Mike. Since the split of Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash there are a number of new paradigms like decentralisef development with multiple implementation teams and a community wide embrace of the concept of hard forking as a governance mechanism. I think these address some of the underlying issues that led to paralysis of BTC. Are there other unaddressed factors that you think we should look out for so we can build more resilience into the Bitcoin cash community to guard against having another episode like what happened with Bitcoin core?,1522931108

The demographic representation of bitcoin is very overstated and highly misleading. I don’t get most of you people who have these barriers about understanding bitcoin. It’s almost as if any of that should matter. It doesn’t at all. Maybe it’s envy. Maybe because bitcoin is fair and no one wants fair but they demand fairness. Maybe it’s because some people got rich and who likes rich people. Cough cough. I see people idolizing Zuckerberg and Bezos all the time. And they are white too. I really don’t have any answers to any of this. I reckon it’s best to leave you to your own vices. Bitcoin is opt in.

Exactly!!! I think we as a crypto community need to dig deep and understand why we have cryptos in the first place. It was because of the large financial and governmental institutions over arching control on the economic system. I don’t think the new people in Crypto quite understand this yet.

"Not only did I swallow the story I find it delicious and satisfying, and your rebuttal strengthens my argument.  By the way, this argument was fleshed out years ago, before you ever heard about Bitcoin. It's sad that you're just now getting expressed to it.

First off, economics happens at the margins. Will ALL poor people be able to participate? No. But billions could, and perhaps tens or hundreds of millions will.

Secondly, cryptocurrency does not require government endorsement.  In places where people are already regularly violating laws to deal with their collapsed economies, including printing their own paper currency, cryptocurrency is definitely a viable alternative.

Next: you can't have your cryptocurrency savings confiscated in the same way as savings in a bank or even a stash of gold or banknotes.

"I'm afraid there is no ELI5 version. Since adults running extremely complex mathematical equations can still not come to a conclusion. One side is calling the people not smart enough to verify these equations stupid. While the other side seems to be pulling their own equations out and whining that they are not doing it right. So to put it bluntly it is more like ALI5(act like I'm 5) type scenario. Since the math, on both sides, SEEMS to work out it all comes down to is it financially WORTH IT. In the current state of the Bitcoin network the miners are in this for the long haul and philosophically are playing by the rules. So the idea of selfish mining happening NOW, with the current miners, is very unlikely. 
This could change if a new mining institution came along who's entire goal was to come in steal and run away, this also means they must have plans to offload all the expensive equipment or utilize it somewhere else. The only chance of this scenario happening if Visa/mc/PayPal/banks and govs came along did the whole SM thing, until it BREAKS Bitcoin, and probably the entire cryptocurrency market, beyond repair. Then created  their own global  electronic currency using the mining equipment they used for the attack. This seems TOO expensive of a way to run this ATTACK when it seems like the scaling debate and now SM/HM seems to be ripping the community apart, already? Attacking from within by division,animosity, and anger is much cheaper and seems to be working VERY WELL.


All the following questions still seem to be unanswered.
Is either side right? Is either side wrong? If there is not a compromise or at least an end to this debate will it end in another chain split? Has the side that says selfish mining is a problem provided fixes or a roadmap to make fixes? Is it even fixable? The concept of doublespend proofs have been around for quite some time can we at least implement these? If we had proofs as an early warning sign could miners react to these proofs?

"Global adoption will only happen when the coins gets spread around globally. Bitcoin can last a long time but can only succeed when it becomes money. When there is to much hoarding of it, it will never be able to become money.  Right now there is no crypto, not even Bitcoin that can call itself a currency. As one economist famously said: if you have to explain that it's money, it's not money. 

This is not an easy problem to solve. What sales guy sold the very first telephone? Pretty useless right until you have 2.  Now Bitcoin has already seen some of this network effect. Primarily silk road. Bitcoin had a real use case there, it offered a real solution to a real problem.  To most businesses on the planet, whether online or offline their current payment systems are not as big  a problem as a drug user trying to buy drugs in countries where you can get in a lot of trouble for that. 


So a certain sacrifice is required. People will have to spend or even give away their coins knowing that this will help kickstart a real economy knowing that these coins they get rid of will become more valuable because of it. 

Now if there are enough people that start doing this, the people that spend them or give them away will also start receiving them back. After all, that's still the primary function of money. To facilitate trade. 


So these big hoarders can keep their coins but this will delay the network effect. Or they can do whatever they can to make the coins start flow. 


As to what will come next, nobody knows. Bitcoin changes the dynamics of money quite a bit. And nobody has any idea what kind of possible future that will lead to. Don't expect salvation from a piece of software. If we don't want to create a better world with the current tools we have a new tool won't change anything about that. But a good tool always makes it easier to do whatever you do with it, so if you use it to do good you can me more effective with it.

"Oh fuck me. You can't answer any of my points. Volatility is on better than inflation when the price goes up. Inflation only reduces your wealth if you have your assets in places where the interest/return is less than inflation. And if your money is there, then why the fuck are you investing in cryptocurrency when you dont know basics of savings accounts?

Bitcoin is not a joke to yourself, as you said that cryptcurrency returns are correlated, therefore you should be looking at the market leader to determine what moves other cryptos make. If you disregard Bitcoin, and say that it encourages lack of knowledge, despite being the market leader, with the highest market cap by miles, then you cannot disregard in price analysis. Further, no cryptocurrency is a utility. There currencies.

Cool so tell me your prediction for Bitcoins price in 3 weeks and layout your fundamental analysis, and we can see how far off your prediction is.

Finally on your point of visa transactions, cryptocurrency will take for fucking ever to reach that point. Bitcoin processed about 400,000 transactions a day at its peak, ETH/BCH have never come close to that. The same amount of transactions happen with VISA every minute. There are so many issues with refunds, usability, volatility, and these or need to be sorted before it gets to widespread adoption, and if your talking about it replacing VISA, then you would need to replace the monetary base of the EU and USA to reach this point.

Most people are not economically free because either their leader/government does not want them to be or because their leader/government are irresponsible and have no idea how to create a functioning economy. 

For example, I’m sooooo sure that if Bitcoin was adopted worldwide right now that North Koreans would be free as fuck. Don’t forget about the African villages, I’m sure the war lords will just leave everyone alone because bitcoin.

"&gt; Why would $20 be the market cap of the two coins instead of $11?




because market cap *isn't* the amount of money in a coin. it is the supply multiplied by the price. in my example, the supply is 2, and the current price of the coin, is $10. 2*10 is 20, so the market cap is 20 dollars. however, only 11 dollars have been spent on the purchasing of the coins. so that displays how market cap *does not* show how much money there is in a security.




for instance, the current price of btc is like 7k, so the market cap is (supply)*(7k). so about 115 billion. but many, many, many coins were not bought while the price was 7k, they were bought when it was far less than that. so there is far less than 115 billion dollars in bitcoin. estimates suggest it would be closer to 10 billion dollars.

Create mass mining factories to reduce to the cost of Bitcon by supplying more, and to reduce the cost of production. Ensure those mass mining factories are operated by a number of different companies to prevent control of the network by one party.

At best it was a weird marketing ploy to get BTC holders interested in a privacy coin, since the technology itself was not gonna change significantly, only the name and the distribution. (this marketing ploy failed given the lack of exchange support for the fork, like bittrex not distributing btcp to BTC holders there, only to ZCL holders. I think binance also did not distribute btcp to BTC holders there, but I might be wrong).

"You can understand fundamentals, but crypocurrency prices aren't, and haven't been for the last year, traded on fundamental analysis. Their traded because people believe its going to make them rich. The price that they are currently at might be inflated, might be too low, might be just right, but because of the way the market is, no one has a fucking clue. It's impossible to know what happens in 3 weeks to the price, as it is currently full of speculative investment. 

Secondly, the fact that people are fucking investing in a currency is ridiculous. If you want Bitcoin to become a dominant currency, then it would need to see serious reductions in volatility, which unfortunately will not happen if people are speculating, as there will be to many people profit taking at any given moment, and then individuals rejoining. This will lead to rises and falls as individuals dump coins and buy coins, and so unless we see a massive reduction in the investor mentaility with bitcoin, and it becomes a mentaility of lets use this as a tool to buy things, then Bitcoin will be usable as a secondary currency.

Thirdly, there is no regulation on Bitcoin at the moment, leaving any individual without massive amounts of either fiat currency or bitcoin open to people to manipulate the market for their own gain, at your own expense. And when regulation does come in, there will be a crash as those who have never heard of regulation run the fuck away. 

Finally, why on earth are you keeping all your money in one investment. No one should do that ever, even if the company has the most wonderful mapped out growth plan, which cryptocurrencies dont. Its a recipe for disaster, and effectively a gamble on the outcome of ETH skyrocketing.",1522927517

I didnt mention it but there's a lot of other problems in addition to reproducibility(is that a word?), im just going to loosely mention them before i forget and go to sleep: Most sciences are sat by the leading journals. These are easy to control as there are very few people deciding what gets in and what gets out. Another problem is that science is capital-funded, which means that what gets researched are what capital deems it should research. Im sure you can see the problem with this. There's also implicit ""rules"" in science - certain topics one would do good to stay away from if one wants a future in the field. Even at the highest levels, for example Nature, editors don't hold themselves above shittalking as you see /r/bitcoin trolls do to us if someone should present something which threatens the power structure.

"Why wouldn't a miner fill the largest blocks they can? Bigger blocks and more transactions in a block mean a higher reward from fees. Is there any incentive mechanism for a miner to not run the maximum block size?

In fact, the fee system naturally works to cause blocks to approach 100% full -  any time the blocks aren't full the fees drop and this probably increases people's willingness to send transactions. When the blocks approach 100% available size, the fees start to go up, discouraging transactions.

Obviously full nodes may not want maximally-sized blocks, because the bandwidth used by a typical full node increases as block size increases. I seem to recall reading a BTC full node uses 30 to 50 GB per week (unless you change the configuration to limit bandwidth, obviously.) If the BCH network started to get some serious use the larger block size would probably reduce the number of people willing to pony up for the bandwidth to run a full node.

I'm not sure this disincentive applies to miners much though. The type of person who runs a farm of ASIC miners in a datacenter is probably not bothered by a couple hundred gigabytes of bandwidth in a month.",1522926645

Gold is also produced, but in small amounts compared to the amounts that exists, and destroyed (consumed) sometimes like gold leaf on books and in electronics, but mostly it is held in reserve, making it mostly money.

Bitcoin has no creation (here regarding block subsidy as existing but unfound), and no destruction by consumption (well some keys are forgotten), making it only useful in trade, that is, the only reason to hold it in reserve is to sell it to someone else in the future (who also aquire them for the same reason...) making it pure money, that is money and nothing else. It also has mostly the best properties for that purpose. ",1522925395

FYI in BTC it's now not called a block size limit any more it's called the ""non witness data limit"" and it is the one metric that limits translations, so technically the transaction limit.

This guy, at least from what he's saying, is if the court rules it in the way, that he ends up with the 160k bitcoins ( that is legally his at that moment), he will try to redistribute them, as good as possible, to those who owned them. That is a grand fucking gesture, considering if it's ruled that way, he is a fucking billionaire.

Now if we will take his word for it, that is another thing, if the court will rule it that way, who the fuck knows, as it stands now, you are bound to get absolutely fucking nothing(maybe the fiat value of a bitcoin at that time), but what he is trying to, is to get a CR, and redistribute the money (IN BITCOIN) to the people who rightfully owned them.

"Dapps are for sure the thing that will drive crypto forward. Dapps are essentially the use case for most of crypto - you can even consider storing and transferring value as a specific 'Dapp'. 

So what we're really talking about when we say 'dapp' is the actual real world uses for block chain. 

The issue that we currently have, is that blockchains are slow and expensive. Try and build a poker app. Can't really be done currently because there's not really an implementation of blockchain yet that can operate quickly and cheaply enough to deal cards fast enough, or cheaply enough to make for a satisfying user experience. 

Thankfully, the bulk of the development going in in crypto right now seems to be addressing the scaling issue. I think the first time we see a really good scaling solution implemented (there are a few that look promising, but I'll refrain from picking a horse at this stage), then we will see a literal explosion in Dapp development, and therefore use of crypto / blockchains in general. And that will be a fun and exciting time to be involved!  ",1522922828

Technological innovations, including those underlying virtual currencies, have the potential to improve the efficiency and inclusiveness of the financial system. However, Virtual Currencies (VCs), also variously referred to as crypto currencies and crypto assets, raise concerns of consumer protection, market integrity and money laundering, among others.

Reserve Bank has repeatedly cautioned users, holders and traders of virtual currencies, including Bitcoins, regarding various risks associated in dealing with such virtual currencies. In view of the associated risks, it has been decided that, with immediate effect, entities regulated by RBI shall not deal with or provide services to any individual or business entities dealing with or settling VCs. Regulated entities which already provide such services shall exit the relationship within a specified time. A circular in this regard is being issued separately.",1522922695

"**Civil forfeiture in the United States**

Civil forfeiture in the United States, also called civil asset forfeiture or civil judicial forfeiture or occasionally civil seizure, is a controversial legal process in which law enforcement officers take assets from persons suspected of involvement with crime or illegal activity without necessarily charging the owners with wrongdoing. While civil procedure, as opposed to criminal procedure, generally involves a dispute between two private citizens, civil forfeiture involves a dispute between law enforcement and property such as a pile of cash or a house or a boat, such that the thing is suspected of being involved in a crime. To get back the seized property, owners must prove it was not involved in criminal activity. Sometimes it can mean a threat to seize property as well as the act of seizure itself.

"To me, one of the key aspects of Bitcoin is trying to undermine some of the monopolies of the state, to build communities outside of its spheres of influence. There are other decentralized technologies that are developing at the same time, e.g. world wide web, renewable energy, smart grids, 3-d printing, robotics that are going to allow people to build lives that are much less intertwined with state power. It's much easier to avoid sending your kids to state schools if you have the internet and can subscribe them to classes online, for example. Same thing goes with welfare. If your house has a solar panels on the roof that power all of its 3-d printers and robots and cryptocurrency miners then you don't need to claim welfare if you lose your job.

I know the statist line ""but who is going to pay for the roads???"" and right now I don't have an alternative to state power for things like that that have inherently high degrees of centralization, but as technology advances more large centralized organisations are going to look more and more like dinosaurs.

Ultimately yes, we can completely leave a society if we don't agree to its rules. It's the same thing that led to the creation of the USA.

And then in June 2011, there was the famous [Gawker Silk Road article](http://gawker.com/the-underground-website-where-you-can-buy-any-drug-imag-30818160) which brought price to $31.91 and four days later caused US senators Charles Schumer and Joe Manchin [to urge FBI to shut down Silk Road](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-06-16/bitcoins-currency-of-the-geeks#p1), spotlighting Bitcoin as the only way of payment on illegal market.

This chain of events led to US government looking into Bitcoin, and ultimately the Department of Homeland security seizing MtGox's Wells Fargo and Dwoilla accounts on May 9th and 15th 2013. This left MtGox without $5 million in customer funds. The reason for this was, I suspect, because MtGox was the biggest exchange where people got their bitcoins for spending on Silk Road, although it was done under pretense of MtGox allegedly not giving correct info in some money transmitter forms filed in the US.

My personal theory was that MtGox solvency problems actually started in May 2013 due to the seized accounts. /u/MagicalTux, can you confirm or deny that this was the case?",1522916843

"Hi /u/BCHisRogersCoin,

It seems as though you're fairly new to the crypto scene based on your account age and username, so hopefully you'll forgive me when I say that it seems like you've jumped to a few conclusions prematurely.

Firstly, I feel you've misjudged the purpose of Bitcoin Cash, and by extension Roger's public position on and promotion of the fork. Second, while I can only truly speak for myself in this,(although from the impressions I get from this community the majority of us here feel the same way) the true goal I see at the end of the tunnel for this movement is a global financial independence the likes of which we have not really seen in human history.

The argument that the OP is supporting here is not *primarily* directed at the actions of Core (although it is saying they're somewhat culpable given the roadblock to technological progress they've imposed), but at the current global financial system that I see Bitcoin (now Bitcoin Cash) as the silver bullet to replacing.

There are **a huge** number of hurdles that cryptocurrency has to overcome to become a financially viable option for 2nd and 3rd world nations, but the sentiment from this community (including Roger), is that we no longer have hurdles being imposed, deliberately or otherwise, on this goal from within the movement in the form of a questionable scaling roadmap, or artificially high usage fees.

The aim should always be to keep the barrier for entry and usage as low as humanly possible, so people who only earn $2 *a day* can experience the financial freedom that most of us 1st world redditors are used to experiencing, and so that a censorship-resistant, pseudonymous digital currency is available to anyone who needs it at any time.

I urge you to read more about the scaling debate, and look deeper into the *actual* changes which each August 2017 fork made, and then make your conclusions based on those details rather than knee jerk reactions from the BTC fans.

This movement really does have the power to change the world, but to do this we need to work together and build it into something unstoppable, otherwise (as is the case with the US) we run the risk of these token becoming just another speculative asset to store (fiat) value in, and which are taxed according to profit...",1522912662

"Year 2038 problem exists when UNIX time is stored as 32-bit signed integer. Most older UNIX systems did that way, nowadays 64-bit signed integer is most often used instead. But POSIX standard actually does not say, should time_t be signed or unsigned. If you use 32-bit unsigned integer instead, you have one extra bit and it will overflow 68 years later. QNX 6 operating system, for example, used that.

There are possible fixes without moving to 64-bit integer. For example, you could use some block version bit to specify different starting date/time for a timestamp.

Probably, not using different starting date/time for timestamps in Bitcoin is one little think that could have been done better from the start. There was no point in timestamps before year 2009. Then we could have room for extra 39 years here. That's common practice, for example, Telit GPS/GPRS modules uses timestamps with starting date 2000-01-01.",1522912449

"In my country we still don't pay taxes in crypto profit unless you do this professionally (aka trader).

The best way for taxes in this work would be you put 100€ and with all the trades (crypto to crypto) you end up cashing out 1000€. If they tax the 900€ profit that would be so easy to understand, but with crypto to crypto taxable damnnn ",1522912326
"Yes! This needs to happen ASAP. Normal punters have lost any confidence in crypto due to the constant drops since early Jan.

Good coins with real world uses, ready to go live soon are suffering because of the drops to BTC.

Hopefully fiat to alts will happen ASAP..",1522912314
"I think it's time bcash boys find a new nail to hammer on. This bitcoin blockchain congestion nail is so last year. Yes, transaction times and fees got out of hand, thanks to big blockers for wasting all your money on transaction fees trying to spam the mempool. All you did was make the real bitcoin, aka the only bitcoin stronger.",1522912250
"&gt; Existence of altcoins is not the same as falling more than half in marketcap, is it?

Unless you think the altcoins are worthless, I am afraid that is exactly what would have happened, either way. 

The only argument that you could put forward is if ETH would have been built on BTC. That was never going to happen in reality. 

&gt; Do you think that the market gives a shit to what sansung mongrol says?

Your true colours come out. Calling someone a mongrol? Really? 

The market is speaking every minute of the day. BCH has less market cap, less hash power, and less accumulated difficulty. By every market measure that BCH proponents use to rail against BTC, BTC is the true Bitcoin, and BCH is an alt. 

Even worse, an alt eating into the market share of the actual market consensus viewed Bitcoin! ",1522912038
"I understand where you are coming from, but you dont seem to understand that if miningpools which consist of individual miners are the biggest problem in bitcoins decentralization, that we are in a very good place. You, and your article dont understand what decentralized is.

The reason why these pools are still so big are simple: Its not a problem at the moment, and they will shrink when they might become a problem. All these individual miners want to protect their investment and they will make the best choice for that, individually.

Compare bitcoin with any other value ecosystem there is and you see that bitcoin is miles ahead. Are we in the perfect place yet? No. But because bitcoin consists of thousands of individuals who are miners, developers, traders, hodlers etc it is the moest decentralized thing we have in this world. 

Please show me something better in this than bitcoin. You cant, there is nothing in the history of mankind.

"Literally the same thing. Doesn't matter why it happens, because it still does. Bitcoin is still what the vast, vast majority of the public considers crypto to be. If there's going to be another run, BTC will have to lead it. Until there is a large range of established fiat-alt pairings, and other projects see legitimate, widespread adoption, BTC will continue to influence the market - pretty much single-handedly.",1522911943

"Technically yes! Bitmain [states](https://blog.bitmain.com/en/regarding-recent-allegations-smear-campaigns/) that it has never actually been used (on mainnet) by customers or in their own farms.
It should take a firmware update to support AsicBoost.

"Changelly has a baked in 0.5% fee on top of the rate that I learned about the hard way. Shapeshift has two different order options it looks like with different rates.

"What you see as manipulation is normal market fluctuations, this is how the bitcoin market works, its one of the most free markets we have. 

You can always ask your questions to me, I am in crypto quite some time and dont look at the price as the most important indicator for progress. 

So you state that the market is working as intended? I dont understand what your question is. Maybe you are a bit emotional about how much the market is dropping at the moment, but for me, that is just temporarily market mechanics.

The g20 will discuss bitcoin, lightning is growing every day, so many more people are involved in crypto than 12 months ago, its not going away anymore.

Bitcoin is unique, we have nothing comparable in this world, its the most decentralized, most secure value ecosystem we have, nothing comes close. Why do you have trouble seeing that? ",1522911602
