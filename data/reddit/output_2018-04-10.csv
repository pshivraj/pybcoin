"Very interesting article. Even if you just take the one coin with a decent volume as being alive, you would have made almost the same profit as with bitcoin. Consider the following fact: in 2013, almost noone traded alts as it was questionable and complicated enough to trade bitcoin. Therefore to buy the lowest ranked coins of all would be a crazy move. would you invest in all those cmc 1400 ranked coins if you look at them?
I guess not and therefore one can expect even better results when doing research about alts, although I don't want to play the hindsight game.",1523429766

"Hmm, you're right on all counts but I do think that scarcity, bitcoins in particular, could rival that of gold in the future. It has immutability, instant global transactions, easier storage, decentralisation, easier divisibility, (arguably) better environmental impacts regarding mining, and probably other advantages.

The problem becomes one of value attribution. If future populations regard the above traits that make gold valuable; elemental, tangibility, wearable, shiny (which I can't see them doing, by the way...), then the case can be made that bitcoin does gold's job better than gold does. ",1523429097

It was and still is too difficult for the common user to obtain and make payments with bitcoin.  Its difficult for merchants to confirm payments.  Confirmations take too long.

"Are you seriously arguing that the important takeaways from Bitcoin is batching transactions and PoW? Those are simply implementation details, and has nothing to do with whether a blockchain is public or permissioned.

The most important problem Bitcoin was solving is the problem of trust in a shared ledger. It does so through decentralization/consensus and computing a cryptographic hash chain that is infeasible to tamper with. Those things are definitely still present in these 'private' chains.

"You can do fractional reserve on BTC or BCH right now—you need only deposit your BTC/BCH with some trusted entity that transacts on your behalf while keeping track of your balance on a private ledger. The issue is that there is no incentive to do such a thing. The Lightning Network provides that incentive in the form of well-connected hubs with lots of liquidity that can save you the high fees of transacting on-chain. 

I could see LN hubs offering two types of services—one where security conscious people run their own LN node and connect to hubs for a subscription fee, and another where customers could use the hub’s liquidity &amp; connectedness for free, if only they agree to deposit their BTC with them. These deposits would then become the reserves upon which said hubs could issue credit. If the hub is sitting on a large sum of BTC and the balance only fluctuates by a small amount each settlement period (bc incoming and outgoing payments are roughly equal) they could easily lend more BTC than they actually own—that is, their reserves would only constitute a fraction of the BTC in their outstanding loans. 

Not saying this scenario will play out, but LN/BTC definitely creates the incentive where none exists with BCH. I.e. why pay extra or expose yourself to 2nd layer risk just to transact instantly at almost no-cost, when you can simply do that on-chain?",1523428755
"In all seriousness, have you ever written an academic paper or thesis? 

It is absolutely fine to copy formulas, concepts, even word for word descriptions; so long as you make it explicitly clear that you are doing that. 

Reproducing stuff from other papers within proper citations is plagiarism. I.e. passing off the work and ideas of someone else as your own.

"&gt; although I believe the ""publishing old state"" problem is not going to be a real-life problem. The risk is too high, chance of succeeding too small, and the penalty almost guaranteed.

The risk of systemic failure grows greater and greater (eventually becoming inevitable) the more the main chain is artificially constrained relative to the size of the overlying layers.  

&gt;But where's the ""fractional reserve"" coming in to picture? Was it just a random word you inserted, to use a known bad expression to get peoples attention? Or did it actually have some significance.

I didn't bring it up. You're confusing me with another poster.  I don't see how the *LN* leads to fractional reserve banking. But I do see how crippling Bitcoin's transactional capacity could lead to fractional reserve banking.  If actually settling on chain is too expensive, more people will be incentivized to avoid on-chain transactions and, e.g., leave their coins on exchanges and make and accept payments in the form of off-chain balance transfers between accounts.  More realistically, I think that if the BTC chain continues to artificially limit its capacity, that it will simply be outcompeted by an unhobbled alternative.",1523428050

I honestly hope the BTC implementation of the Bitcoin protocol does work out, its better for cryptocurrency as a whole that way. Besides, BTC will always be my first experience with cryptocurrency. I think what is going on with the communities and development is a sad story.

The traditional Bitcoin protocol is a trust-less, permission-less distributed ledger, that makes everyone their own bank.

Please correct me if I’m wrong, the Lightning Network protocol, is a hub and spoke design. By design, it is much more susceptible to FRB.

Seriously, you can literally achieve lightning’s main features on L1, and even in that case, you can still run a beta LN on L2.

These are coins I am genuinely interested in for a variety of reasons.  Some are slightly higher than 25 mil and I wouldn't consider any of them *hidden* gems unless you were new to the scene.

- **HST** - Decision token. 13 mil. Token used for voting. IIRC, the total supply slowly burns away. Had some actual use cases already. 
- **AMB** - How has no one mentioned Ambrosus yet? Food and Medicine supply chain. Developing a working product. Big year planned. Possible huge partnerships.
- **MLN** - Melonport. 28 mil. Crypto Asset management. My simple monkey brain makes the full potential of this project difficult to grok. From their website: ""*Disrupting the US$84.9 trillion asset management industry, one block at a time.*"" If they can get even a ssssssliver of the asset management market, that would be some incredible gains from where they are right now.
 
- **INT** - Internet Node Token. Internet of Things market competitor. 17 mil market cap. Listed on very few exchanges at the moment. [Check out their partners (with a grain of salt)](https://intchain.io/#teamwork). There was FUD about the Huawei partnership, but that has since been confirmed to be true.  
    
Last but not least, my absolute favorite. I know NEX (Neon Exchange) is on the way and several other DEX's being developed, but I have really enjoyed using:  

-  **SWH!!** - Switcheo is a simple to use Neon Decentralized Exchange. It is intuitive and is one-stop shopping for all your favorite NEP5 tokens. It is very new. Marketcap unknown.",1523424997

A store of value is a store relative to anything else of value.

Which is also precisely why:

&gt; The “paper” money is what gives the value to alt coins.

is completely incorrect.

&gt; Thus allowing a variety of factors to artificially inflate their values (speculation for example).

Even if the basis for this statement was correct, the point your trying to make would also apply perfectly to bitcoin as well.

It’s not “a narrative”, it’s their position in the scaling debate... Not a week ago Pierre Rochard was having an argument with me on here about how he thought blocksizes were already *too big*. I’m not saying he speaks for all of Core, but Bitcoin Cash exists because the developers at Core decided as a whole that blocksize increases should be used as a last resort and instead scaling should be dealt with by moving a majority of transactions off chain to a 2nd layer.

Obviously a blocksize increase is inevitable if the network ever wants to process a substantial number of transactions. No one is debating that. The debate is about both the short-term and long-term value of block space and what role it will play in scaling the network.",1523424722

"Bears have been more active than bulls in last 3 months. Evidenced by the BTC price moving from 19K to 7K. Therefore why ""bulls have been asleep.""

You need to zoom out, stop thinking short term, those pump and dump formations are insignificant in the broad scheme of things. See /u/arsonbunny for his speculative post about the reasons behind those formations.

Price doesn't ""seem"" like it is in equilibrium, it is in equilibrium. It has been relatively flat for the last 13 days. There is no conspiracy, whales want to make money, they don't care which way the price moves. 

What is the reason for your price target of 4K? What fundamental valuation model have you used? Anyone can pick a number.

"Thank you for the feedback! A few things in response:

First, I am not recommending that anyone take my post as financial advice. I'll make this even clearer next time I post something. When people ask for advice on The Daily thread, one of the first things I usually say is not to invest any more than you can afford to lose. For most people, including me, that's not much at all. 

Second, I think it's totally fair to believe that most alts will never reach their all-time highs again. I've been asking the same question that you raise here when I think about Bitcoin: why is the price so high? My conclusion for both Bitcoin and the alts is that there is little to nothing concrete at this point to justify their prices. Rather, current market prices represent market expectations concerning the future adoption and usage of cryptocurrency. That doesn't mean the market's right, though. Much smarter people than me have observed that cryptocurrency as a whole appears to be speed-running 500 years of bad economics. I've only started buying crypto since February of this year because I was angry at myself for several previous missed opportunities, including when Litecoin was only about $10. That is, AOMO (anger, instead of fear).

&gt; The reason Bitcoin cant Hardfork is because the more people involved in the network the harder it is to agree to change it. Human nature.

The reasons given were bullshit, actually. It served Core's purpose to cast hardforking as impossible. Do you forget that Bitcoin 2x had greater than 90% miner support, and Core still refused to HF?

It's not true. On-chain can scale to over 500 billion transactions per year, on existing hardware, with no need to invent a 2nd layer solution.

Scaling on-chain was always the plan. Satoshi himself said on-chain scaling never hits an effective limit. You've just been propagandized by people whose interests are served by not scaling on-chain.

Core cannot make a single dime on any on-chain transactions, but with Lightning they can shift transaction fees from miners to themselves. That is what is behind all of this.

&gt; I’m enthusiastic about the blockchain technology that makes Bitcoin possible. In fact, Vanguard is using such technology. As for Bitcoin the currency? *I see a decent probability that its price goes to zero.*

&gt; A currency is a store of value. Bitcoin is not. *Its price volatility undermines its adoption, as fewer vendors will accept a currency whose value can fluctuate so dramatically.*

&gt; *The investment case for cryptocurrencies is weak.* Unlike stocks and bonds, currencies generate no cash flows such as interest payments or dividends that can explain their prices.

"There are a few obstacles I see preventing wide-spread adoption right now.

- Asset class. Converting USD to Bitcoin is annoying. There is a percentage of bitcoin users that have never mined bitcoin or purchased anything with it. They simply view it as an investment and will sell it all once the price gets high enough for them. Are these people even considered users? 
- Volatility. Because the price is constantly going crazy it scares off anyone who might consider making a major purchase with it. As far as I know the only huge purchase to ever be made with bitcoin was some gold thing associated with Nelson Mandela. At least when you buy things with USD you don't have the value obsession because no one really cares about the purchasing power of the dollar considering it is relatively stable. Bitcoin is not a realistic way to actually pay for anything over $1000. 
- Technobabble bullshit. Honestly, if you saw Ready Player One and the Halliday character - that is exactly what Satoshi is to some people. All this stuff appears fake and complicated and weird. Crypto needs to stop feeling like a garage in Cupertino and more like a bank where you can talk to a human and get protection if something goes wrong.

"&gt; This would be like saying that since you need programs to run a computer, a computer is not turing complete.

No, it's not like that at all.  Your computer and Bitcoin both run programs but your computer has conditional jumps, and therefore can do loops and recursion, making it Turing complete.  Bitcoin does not, therefore it is not.

&gt; The only thing that matters is whether the system can calculate any algebraic number and some transcendental numbers

Not really... an arbitrarily large Turing-complete system can compute any computable function, of which those are just examples.

&gt;  or primitive recursion and non-primitive recursion.

Now you're finally getting close.  A Turing-complete system must have some form of loop or recursion flow control.  It can be done with as few as [one instruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_instruction_set_computer#Instruction_types), any one of many, but Bitcoin has **exactly zero** such instructions.

An instance of Bitcoin script is a decider and a Total Turing Machine.  CSW has said the former (which directly contradicts a claim of TC by the way), but mistook Total Turing Machine for Universal Turing Machine.  They are not equivalent, and a TTM is, unintuitively, not Turing-complete.

As I have said many times, if Bitcoin script were TC it would be a major bug that would have to be fixed immediately, or anyone could DoS attack every miner and validating node to deadlock.  *Any* Turing-complete system can be put into an infinite loop, and such a program *cannot* always be detected.",1523418512

I'd wait at the moment. The market is built on hype and while the lawsuit is laughable (basically 1 person demanding NANO to fork so he can get his bitgrail NANO's back instead of using his money and working with the community to go after Bomber from Bitgrail) it brings negative attention so people steer clear. It's similar to how it was after the bitgrail incident - holders have jumped off and are hoping to catch the falling knife. The sentiment will change just like it did last time and when it does I think it'll bounce back hard. Just watch it. Wallets are due soon and I read on the discord that the ios one is just waiting for approval (which apparently doesn't take too long) so that may cause a momentary spike. If BTC and the market picks up I expect it to recover quicker than most alts given how hard it has been hit.

The first crtieria is bullshit. So ethereum is not a true crypto?,1523416068
"I think your reasoning is specious, more or less.  You mark your gains from the bottom of the trough that can only be identified in hindsight, as there's no way to know where the bottom is, and on the way down (for any security, not just cryptos) there will be a lot of bumps that look like bottoms that are actually the dead cat that got shoved off the roof bouncing off successively lower awnings and clotheslines as it approaches the pavement.  You also make the faulty assumption that patterns will continue indefinitely.

&amp;nbsp;

With regards to the first issue, look at a bitcoin price chart during and after the bear market period you mentioned - there were a series of bull traps between the $500 to $700 level between the November 2013 peak and July of 2014, while the overall trend was a fall from $1150 to $250 in January of 2015 followed by another eight or nine months of sideways trading before the next bull run started.  If someone thought the market bottomed out during the weeks of sideways trading at the beginning of May 2014 when BTC/USD was down 61% from the then-ATH, they would have been underwater for two years.  Same deal for a portfolio of altcoins that aren't picked in hindsight.

&amp;nbsp;

With regards to the second and more serious issue, we cannot assume that a pattern will continue indefinitely even if it has repeated several times.  To illustrate this, take a look at the pattern of cpu speed doubling roughly every 18 months (referred to as Moore's Law in common parlance, though this is a misnomer - Moore was talking about transistor density rather than clock rate), which held for decades.  There were continuous naysayers saying that the end of the pattern was nigh for years and years, and they kept being wrong and  Intel kept laughing them off.  They introduced the NetBurst architecture in 2000, with an initial clock speed of 1.3 GHz, assuming they'd be able to scale it up to 10 GHz.  They got less than half that far before the decades-old pattern suddenly ended (for a technical explanation why this happened, google ""cpu power wall"" and ""Dennard scaling"").  CPU clock speeds have been more or less stagnant since 2005, with increases in computing power coming from other directions.  The fact that microprocessors are a fundamentally sound, useful and valuable technology didn't mean that past trends would continue forever, just like the fundamental utility of distributed ledgers built on blockchain tech (or DAGs or consensus algorithms or whatever) doesn't mean the price of securities linked to those technologies will continue to undergo cyclical bubbles and crashes like they have since 2009.",1523416043

If everyone is coming to the same conclusions re X and Y, then you will find Y gets horded, making it more scarce, and eventually the exchange rate changes to reflect the value differential.

"What do you mean the best I have, that's exactly what they are. A currency that has no real existence.

Look at it almost like buying a gift card. You take $100 and you transfer it into a $100 gift card for a specific store. Has that added any value at all? no, because the value didn't increase. All it did was take the $100 and transfer it into an exact copy that is now only usable in one specific store instead of the entire economy. So all it does is ruin the power of the original $100 that you have (i.e, its a fucking shit gift).

Bitcoin is the same, it isn't as easy to buy the same product with a bitcoin as it is with a dollar, its not accepted everywhere, so the only value that it possibly holds is its exchange rate against the dollar, but aside from that it hold no value at all.

How is that different from other investments you ask? because with other investments you're buying into something of real value. You can buy a property purely because you want the price to rise and fall, but either way you can make use of it by either living in it, or, renting it out.

With shares you own part of the company you buy into, so while most people hold it for the changes in shareprice you still actually own a part of the company relates to, and like rent on a property, you can still be entitled to dividends, so there is an asset backing your share and potential income regardless of share price fluctuations.

With bitcoin, there is no asset at all, nothing, theres also no periodic revenue that comes from holding it, so its like all other investments but with more flaws. Furthermore, like a gift card it also holds less purchasing power than a dollar. 

The only reason that bitcoin has been successful at all is because people think it will be successful, that's all. The only reason crypto currencies can fluctuate are entirely based on people random speculation of it, and for that reason alone its a bad investment because the market is driven entirely by dreams and random thoughts. If one idiot dreamer wants to sell and there are five idiot buyers, the price goes up, that's the only driver.

You saying that you're buying crypto because of stupid people and you want to milk it, fine, its a random investment choice but have at it. Saying that banks, with tangible business methods that facilitate credit and mortgages that also have gold bullion backing the dollars in their safes are going to go out of business because you can't buy a fantasy dollar that you can't even hold that has no asset backing will go out of business only tells me one thing.

Just because you may make a billion dollars off crypto one day, doesn't mean you have any idea what you're doing, your entire investment strategy is based off speculation and dumb luck.

An asset stream that holds no value but a high price is called a bubble (You can't even really call it an asset stream, since there is no asset). The crypto market is clearly in a bubble. 

Google ""dot com bubble chart""
Then google pretty much most crypto currency charts for the last few years.

They look, exactly, the fucking, same. The market is crashing because exactly like the .com bubble there is nothing there, you are buying nothing, crypto is nothing. Its the same as spending money in a videogame through microtransactions in order to get in game currency, except there is no game to play here. Theres nothing.

"Segwit transactions result in a *block weight* that exceeds 1mb due excess witness data (about 2/3 of Segwit transactions). The vast majority of nodes on the network are still non-Segwit and still only ever process 1mb blocks. 

It is fundamentally NOT a network block size increase, but a voluntary behavior that changes the way data is stored on blocks. Since this behavior is entirely voluntary, it’s blocks - no matter their size - could be processed as 1mb blocks by a regular old node. If you want to verify this, just google it, I’m too lazy to do it for you.

That's a garbage sentence. Paper is here:

The paper is unreadable. In the next section ""Turing machines Revisited"" he states:

*""First, we define any Turing complete program to be a program that halt.""*

Where to even start with this? Turing completes means a Turing machine can simulate any other Turing machine. This is followed by a bunch of garbage logic. The entirety of page 3 is stating he defines decidability as halting. Wonderful. This goes on and on for some reason.

"Some details about BTTS were untrue so here is a corrected explaination of BTTS:

BTTS is a very cool service coming to Devery and then a few tokens in the future. Bokky Poobah is creating btts so that a system will automatically use pools of ETH to pay gas fees in exchange for Devery. This will creat an environment for decentralized exchanges that don't need gas for token transfers in the future and Devery will be the among the first tokens to implement this. I think this is as significant as lightning network for BTC as it will make the etherium network more convenient to use in the future. Many people are confusing BTTS with masternodes but that is simply not the case. BTTS nodes are an automated trustless service and users will NOT stake ETH to receive Devery.  The node will maintain a large enough pool to handle transactions on it's own. the goal of BTTS is to separate the need for token holders to own ETH period through an automated trustless system. This Bokky cleared this up the other day on telegram. So there is no need to fear about people selling their EVE for ETH to stake because people will not be able to run the BTTS service. Also having the service will create higher devery liquidity as transactions rise because users will purchase devery instead of ETH to send tokens. Some may say there is no reason to hold utility tokens like Devery because they won't appreciate in value but for verification services corporations must hold Devery for the products they want verified so as long as more products that need verification are being added the amount of Devery in circulation will decrease thus increasing the price. Judging by Devery's current partnerships it should have no problem delivering value to those who support it. Especially this early (6M marketcap wtf) I'm very excited for this project and the partnerships are really driving my excitement to new highs. It's gonna be a good year for the Devery team.

Actual sentiment traders rely on a hell of a lot more data than you think. That data is just far more abstract than your chart traders but it does require just as much left brain activity and only adds right brain activity to the equation.

Sentiment trading gets a bad name but a good one will win far more trades than just a chart trader will.

And honestly, in crypto, there are no real chart trading opportunities. Its ALL sentiment trading to a greater or lesser degree. I am aware of the building of chart trading in crypto, but the variances are far to wide spread for me to use them at the moment because in my mind most crypto traders are batshit crazy.

"It's not that simple. How many bitcoin transactions that are processed isn't a matter of raw power. If 1/2 the miners quit tomorrow, the hash difficulty would go down, the block rate would be restored, and the number of transactions processed per second would stay the same. So, if power becomes cheaper, we'll get more miners and the difficulty will go up. If processing power increases, we'll get increases in the hash rate, which will cause the difficulty to go up. The power consumption problems STAYS.

The only solution is technologies like lightning. But, these aren't really bitcoin, nor do they have the same benefits of having your transactions written to the distributed ledger. So, having Visa / Mastercoin as lightning nodes doesn't really sounds like saving bitcoin though technology to me. It sounds like a corporate takeover.

Though what I see happening is it getting to a point where the banks say enough is enough. The banks then paying the government a big ol lot of cash (this shit happens all the time) and the government tightening (to the point of attrition). Essentially making crypto invaluable.

"I don't have an answer to that. But, there are some things we could probably do to move in the right direction. 1. apply our skillsets (whatever they may be) to better the tech. Whether its through development, design, community growth - adoption, education.. whatever - as long as you are contributing more than just $. There is just too many stupid projects that don't need the $ but get it anyway. I agree with the previous commenter that communities exist to weed out crap, but at the current rate we are only passively watching shit burn down while the corporate world makes moves, and makes them fast. I think we need to welcome much more strict measures when it comes to evaluating projects. Perhaps we can come together as a community and put together a guideline for how to evaluate something and make it an official process. For example, say you have a foundation that vouches for project feasibility and adds their stamp of approval. The public then can invest in these pre-vetted projects, or do their own research on them. At least this way there is a body of authority (hopefully full of experts from many fields who have motivation other than financial) to help weed out shit from gold. Now, I'm not saying anyone HAS to care about what they say but it would be one way to weed out garbage. Next, the could be a crypto-wide foundation to fund very very promising projects. I realize there are some like that already like the ethereum foundation and NEO, but let7s face it, they'll fund anything that has a slight smell of profit. There is hardly any scrutiny. Also, we have a very closed off group of open source communities who are practically paid for by the foundations and have no way to contribute to. Take the CoZ for example - right now if you wanted to help them out, you have to go through some sort of an extensive process to be qualified as a developer. Now, I dont know exactly how CoZ is sponsored, I see that they raise their own money with a NEX ICO, but there's hardly any curated process in place to scrutinize anything they put out. ",1523411520

"I believe Burstcoin is the best 2018 coin if everything goes as planned. Let's be real here, the tech is better then most coins. But it came out I  2014 with 1 good year. But then it had 2 years of bullshit thanks to burstnation and adam guerbuez who did 0 work and just scammed people. Lost 2 years of dev work and people stayed away. New dev team 8 months ago. New whitepaper in Dec 2017. And so far the dev team is hitting all of its goals on the road map. After burstnation and adam and his crew were forced out Burstcoin was left with a great dev team ( one of the best on github in the last 6 months) but 0 marketing. A new marketing just started up 2 weeks ago and we already are working with another blockchain app for a partnership. Next goal for me personally is to start working with over 25 UV movie codes online stores to take burstcoin. We have people walking to waves wallet to add burstcoin support. In the last 3 months the community had 2x and new programmers and marketing people are joining the community. An unknown guy came in 2 months ago and made a plotter that used a $200 to shorten plotting time of an 8tb from 2.5 days to 16 hours. Just came up with his out of nowhere. 

So there you go. You now understand the history and why such a good tech is so undervalued. 

Burstcoin main mission is to do what bitcoin wanted to do. Give the power back to all the people. We love the idea behind bitcoin but it has to many problems. Burstcoin is actually fixing the power issue, the decentralization issue, unfair distribution, allows everyone to get I to mining with DID, not ASIC or fight people for GPUs. And no HDD price won't go up. It's not a GPU. The more demand the world Has asked for in the last 10 years make drives nicer and lower cost. Burstcoin will actually make HDDs even lower cost. Anybody notice the WD 8tb was $300 last year. They are on sale every week from 160 to 200.
Burstcoin has a wallet with smart contracts, crowdfunder, asset exchange, encrypted messenger, and I'm sure I'm missing few more things. Completely ASIC and GPU resistant. It's about capacity so better more expensive drives are no better then the low end drive. 

We are not trying to sell you anything just want to make people aware of what has been going on with Burstcoin I the last 8 months.

Thank you.",1523409001

"This piece focuses almost exclusively on the exchange rate angle of Bitcoin.

Only once does the article discuss what *Bitcoin is for*:

&gt; The underlying technology is the blockchain system—a decentralized, algorithm-generated, regularly updated database distributed across a network of computers. What can you do with blockchain beyond buying drugs on the dark Web? Potentially, quite a lot. A ledger kept among a vast number of computers can transfer money more securely than traditional banks, and, possibly, faster, all the while denying Wells Fargo, say, a cut of the transaction. But that is only the start. Ethereum’s platform, for example, can work as a lawyer-free contract database dealing with everything from property sales to estate transfers.

But instead of new insight, we're lobbed once again the tired blockchain-not-Bitcoin cliche. Still, I'll take this over the Dark Market cliche.

Novogratz himself probably hasn't got a clue of what bitcoin is really for - he just senses momentum the way a shark senses blood in the water. Last year was Bitcoin - next year will be something else.

Journalists and investors do themselves a disservice by failing to ask what the hell Bitcoin is actually for. What jobs does it do that nothing else can? What new uses of money does it open up?

Follow the answers to those questions to their logical, bizarre conclusions, and you get a story/investment thesis worth sharing.

If you consider that there is a mining pool that has 250 % of the total bitcoin cash mining power, the question whether you need 51 % or 33 % or 25 % to attack the network (and destroy the trust) is moot.  We are relying on the fact that the people who control the mining power are not crazy enough to try something like this, and the people that are crazy enough cannot afford the mining power.  And if someone is crazy enough and has the mining power, well worst case would be a POW change.  Both selfish mining and the traditional 51% attack cannot be done in secret.

In economics, the cost-of-production theory of value is the theory that the price of an object or condition is determined by the sum of the cost of the resources that went into making it. The cost can comprise any of the factors of production (including labor, capital, or land) and taxation.

The theory makes the most sense under assumptions of constant returns to scale and the existence of just one non-produced factor of production. These are the assumptions of the so-called non-substitution theorem.

"&gt;&amp;gt;	Sorry I fail to see any benefits from this strategy, it simply too costly (attacker end up wasting magnitudes more hash power than his target) there is no way one can benefit from this situation, whatever it is short or long term.

&gt;The profit margin on production of any commodity tends to approach 0 as more players enter the market.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost-of-production_theory_of_value

It will tend to zero for the attacker also.

Again your attack is ridiculously expensive to next to zero effect.

&gt;&amp;gt;	Also rather easy to hide as you say so a “white list” might be more effective.

&gt;Very very slippery slope.  Now you’ve just changed the permissionless nature of the system, and thus the value proposition.

No, miner can simply have a white list of other they trust doing mining header first. 

I am not talking about white listings blocks but white listing header first mining.

But again this “attack” have to somehow exist.

&gt;&amp;gt;	If none of those are possible, miner can decide to give up mining header first to not waste hash power. (mine empty block while verifying like they do now for example)

&gt;The issue is not the contents of the block, but the previous block hash you’re building on top of.  This answer suggests to me that you need to learn more about how mining works.

Didn’t you said using header mining to trick the competition into mining an invalid block?

&gt;&amp;gt;	Not sure what that has to do with my point but that’s correct.

&gt;My point is that we cant expect to scale everything entirely on-chain, there just isn’t enough bandwidth/CPU available to a wide enough audience to maintain necessary levels of decentralization at anywhere near worldwide adoption levels.

This has nothing to do with my point.

Yes 1MB allow for less miner to participate but far worst is the effect of high fees.

Because it affect small miner.

Forcing consolidation of mining.

&gt;&amp;gt;	It is very healthy for the network that small independent miner remain profitable. 

&gt;We agree here for sure, but the current network topology is actually very poorly designed for this.  In reality, there’s only a few miners(the pools, save for P2Pool) and the majority of end users with hardware are basically just loaning their hashpower to a 3rd party in exchange for payment.  These users have no control over what the pool does with their hardware, and many malicious actions that the pool can perform with it are opaque to the user due to the above mentioned ability to obfuscate the source of a block.  I don’t agree with you on the definition of miner, perhaps that’s part of our disconnect.

Small miner can change pool if it missbehave, lt has already happened in the past.

&gt;&amp;gt;	Do you at least see that small block can cause a risk for decentralisation too?

&gt;Not based on my above definition of miner, based on yours, yes I can see how you’ve come to that conclusion.

Semantic is not an argument.

Decentralisation is a real thing, changing the definition of miner doesn’t change the fact that small miner are being priced out of BTC. 

And it if the goal of BTC is decentralisation it should be a concern.

You are not the only small blocker making argument downplaying the consequences of decentralisation (both mining and nodes decentralisation), this sound strange to me if it is supposed to be your priority.

&gt;&amp;gt;	I understand your position as many small blockers seem to think there is zero risk with keeping small blocks so it make sense to make zero compromise on block size.

&gt;This is not my view, but I don’t see the same risk that you do,  

That doesn’t make it less real.

&gt;The risk that I see is losing network effect due to stifled adoption, not inadequate decentralization.  Of course, if users leave in droves, then you have a threat to decentralization just due to lack of participants, 

Very real risk, not less dangerous that the mining decentralisation I agree.

"&gt; OK. If you say so, then I guess we'll just need to accept it.

What. I gave you sources where they essentially say they cripple on chain to force people onto layer 2.

&gt; There is no LN on anything else, it wouldn't be cheaper on something else, and because of the lack of serious dev work on it elsewhere. One week ago Blockstream released 7 LApps to the dev community, for free, so they can start building on top of that. That's what will bring adoption - Easy to implement, ready to use solutions, not wishful thinking. And network security - There is no other coin which is as secure as Bitcoin today. If BCH keeps going with no problems, and maintaining its value, is because it's MUCH more profitable for miners to mine Bitcoin than attack BCH. The current has power is &lt;10% of the total, that can be attacked extremely easily. EXTREMELY.

It's open source. LN can work on BCH once there's a malleability fix. Yes, and when will those supposed useful stuff come out built on those LApps? Ain't nobody got time for that. Security is proportional to price. There is no attack because it's more profitable to mine honestly. 

&gt; No, it doesn't. I'm not talking block propagation (graphene) or storage (cheap HDD), but syncing up from scratch, validating the full blockchain from zero, in case something goes wrong. Which it always does.

&gt; Nielsen's law of bandwith gets you 50% increase in speed every year. It held true for the past 30yr, so that's the best case scenario. With 1MB blocks the network today adds ~50GB to the blockchain per year. with 2MB blocks it adds ~66% to the blockchain. With 3MB it adds ~100%. And so on.This means that TODAY, not in 10 years, with 3 measly MB blocks, the blockchain increases by 100%, so faster than tech improves. Not strawman, this is reality. This means if it takes, say, ~4hrs on modern hardware to sync up a full node, next year it will take ~6hrs! (100% increased blockchain, by 50% faster internet.) You can do the maths on your own on a long term... just remember Nielsen law for Internet bandwidth and Moore law for hardware advances, not more.

&gt; (Now you can Google around easily and you'll find more than one article which discusses that Moore's law has already come to a halt, but let's assume it's still valid. Doesn't change the conclusion above.)

Again, you don't think there will be any software optimizations when it gets to that point? Look up parallel validation. I am against stagnating because of some possible fears that people have.

&gt; talking about effective block size, bytes written on a disk, not some fictional limit.

Yes, so going to 2MB wouldn't have hurt.

&gt; Ironically, that's what Bitcoin will give you, not BCH. It is fairly accepted in this community that at scale BCH will consist in giant miners and server farms... you won't have a million of those. Guaranteed. A million RasPi's running nodes with small blocks? Much more likely.

How do you guarantee it? Sorry, I don't see it. I see your scenario as the new SWIFT for banks. Unaffordable onchain fees for the regular person. How much do you think it will be? Non mining node does nothing for the network. I suppose you could try to mine your own TX an hope you get lucky.

&gt; So cheap txs are all of a sudden a problem?

Oh come now, we both know it won't stay that way.

&gt; Hmmm.... if the mempool doesn't clear out, how are you gonna prevent high fees? Non-empty mempool = competition to get in block = fee market. Back at square one ;-)
 
It's a free market competition not a centrally made decision. That's the difference. When it's centrally limited, people will go looking elsewhere and they did.

&gt; Keeps the legacy chain alive and kicking... Especially given what happened with BCH, it's kinda obvious that Miners would have stayed with the legacy chain. And so would have businesses. Guess which chain would have been the Bitcoin chain then? Soft forks prevent this kind of attack. A perfectly played hand by the devs, and fulyl supported by myself and others.

We'll see. Too early to tell. Core devs do have client control which was centralization.

&gt; Re-read the paper carefully... The scenario described is very real.

Care to point out the section? Or give me a layman's summary? Maybe I misunderstood the paper.

&gt; Yes, because of the block reward. Nobody argues with that. A fee market would not be necessary if we had a constant block reward. But that's inflationary, and changes one of the fundamental assumptions in Bitcoin. Do you wanna do that? (Btw, and remember my words, in due time you'll see the community argue over this very topic - Should we hard fork to make the block reward constant? Introduce inflation, that is. One of the arguments will be ""Satoshi was not an economist!"". Keep in mind, I promise it will happen.)

No, it won't be a problem. I don't know why you think people won't pay to have their TX mined.

&gt; That's exactly what LukeJr wants to do... but he's also the only one, I think. We're in a relatively good spot now, let's keep it that way.

Arbitrary again. You think it's a good spot. Core devs think it's good. Who knows for sure.

&gt; Yes, plastic. Fiat works perfectly fine. Once BTC is ready for prime time, then it will be a different story.

Fiat doesn't work fine for a lot of people. I'm just not entirely sure when 'prime time' for BTC is.

&gt; And I welcome competition!!! It will be tough though to compete on fees, LN really does that extremely well. But sidechains (RSK) and drivechains are going to be part of the final picture, precisely for the cases Erik mentioned. So what? What's the problem with having a single coin as reference, a reserve coin, with many other coins for specific use cases?? I actually think this is the most likely case. No problems with that. And if one of these coins is BCH, so be it.

Adoption of LN will take years. LN running on a cheaper, faster chain would render LN on BTC moot. A reserve coin isn't really a problem more of crypto should make a reserve anything extinct.

&gt; Sorry, but Bitcoin is either decentralized and trustless, or it's not Bitcoin. We have centrally issued coins today, no need for energy waste if we end up with PayPal 2.0/crypto central banking. High fees are the price to pay for decentralization, and I'm OK with it.

This is what I hear all the time. I ask, then, what is the definition of decentralized? What is decentralized *enough*? How many mining nodes per million people? I say again, decentralization is a sliding scale, not a binary outcome.

&gt; Again, it's to keep the blockchain small. If blocks were not small, companies would not have started working on using SegWit - Why would they, it's only cost for them! Nor batching, the single most efficiency improvement tool at our disposal to rationalize blockchain use. Why bother, if everything can be dumped on the blockchain like you just took shit, and it doesn't cost you a thing? Small blocks forced people to implement all of this.

Lol! It did force some to implement it. It also forced others to other chains.

"Maybe irrelevant, but what about the dollar? It's often given as an example of fungibility in regards to privacy/traceability, but I would consider it ""a bit private."" Maybe more accurately as ""a bit traceable."" The dollar has serial numbers which are/can be traceable, and may have other micropringing identifiers. 

To take it a step further, the dollar, within the financial banking system, can be traced. Digitally this is done with ease, but even cash deposits and withdraws can be traceable, similar to identifying crypto transactions on fiat&gt;crypto gateways or identifying on step along the history of a cryptocurrencies transactions. While this may not de-anonymize everyone in the chain of a dollars corculation, once you have one or two identies or points of purchase, it becomes easier to identify other steps along its history. This applies to both dollars and most cryptocurrencies.

Using identifiers on the dollar one can track a geological center of circulation, its immediate reach, narrowing history down to say a city or potentially by purchase propensity. In crypto this may be similar to identifying a sub-set of users.

Even though non of this may completely break privacy of the ISD/cryptocurrencies, it becomes a level of magnitude easier when other behavior residue, analytics, and big data (such as IP address, browser size, or direct personal information on you) becomes cross-referenced with a transaction.

"I see, you're in the camp that thinks deflationary currencies aren't sustainable. If you want to read a (very) lengthy debate between me and someone else on whether or not that's true, [read this](r/BitcoinDiscussion/comments/86o6p8/philosophical_what_kind_of_world_does_bitcoin/dw7gd3r/).

&gt; It has been shown that a small amount of inflation is good for an economy

Could you support that claim?

&gt; The effects are essentially equivalent to the Fed taking a hardline contractionary monetary policy.

Unless I misunderstand you, I don't think that's accurate. What people usually call ""contractionary monetary policy"" is when the Fed sells more assets than it buys. The Fed couldn't sustain this forever, since they'd run out of assets to sell. If the Fed simply stopped buying or selling anything, that would be equivalent to what bitcoin does, and I don't think anyone calls that ""contractionary"". 

&gt; Deflation spirals out of control, real value of debts are increased, depression inhibits or reverses economic growth, and unemployment skyrockets.

I agree that sudden and unexpected deflation (what some people misleadingly call a ""deflationary spiral"") is not good for an economy, just like sudden and unexpected inflation is bad for an economy. Sudden and unexpected events like that catch a slow-moving market by surprise and cause market distortions that result in inefficient trades and other behavior. 

However, the deflation of a currency like bitcoin is nothing like that. Its neither sudden nor unexpected. In fact, you could almost say there isn't actually even any deflation.  See Bitcoin is a non-inflationary currency, not a deflationary currency. Over the past few years the value of bitcoin has been rising fast on average, which you could call ""value deflation"" or something like that, but this won't last forever. The price will level off at equilibrium and the price should only grow at the rate of economic growth (eg GDP growth) on average. 

So after this equilibrium point, no monetary deflation would actually be happening. And no major decrease in the velocity of money would happen over time either. The only thing that would be happening is that the amount of resources in the economy would be growing while the currency would keep the same quantity, pushing the value of the currency up proportionally.

So I completely disagree with you that non-inflationary currencies like Bitcoin are unstable or unworkable. There are a ton of rebuttals to that position, and I'm sure you've seen some of them.

"EVE will be a winner this year, no doubt. Bokky and BTTS are huge assets to this project, I dont think most people understand what it means.

Bokky Poobah is a legendary smart contract auditor. Every big ICO is looking to get his eyes on their eth contracts before launch. And he's both a team member and advisor to Devery. BTTS (Bokky's Token Transfer Service) is an Ethereum network mechanism that allows users to stake ETH and receive EVE as a reward. In effect it will be used as ""gas"" i.e., EVE can be sent without ETH as gas- it will consume EVE instead. Much like how exchanges deal with withdraw fees and certain trading fees. But this can now happen on chain. EVE is the only thing necessary to interact with Devery protocol! 

There are a ton of other stellar points about EVE. 

1) Partnered with JD.com, one of the world's biggest retailers as some have pointed out.
2) Advised by Dorjee Sun, the guy behind Santiment, Republic Network, and a few other successful crypto projects. He has important connections in the retail world as well.
3) New roadmap, new exchanges, and more announcements coming. They have held back a ton because of the bear market, much like other recent ICOs. There's a reason IDEX and EtherDelta are the only known exchanges currently. My suspicion is that they're getting something big set-up. I joke with fellow EVE investors that it must be Binance. A guy can dream...
4) They haven't hyped their token, they havent even started marketing. And JD will help with the latter as part of their arrangement as a freshman member of JD's crypto incubator. 
5) Devery has been in touch with large industry associations and are taking a very big approach. They're not just targeting a few billion dollar industries. They are targeting all trade and shopping. 
6) MOST IMPORTANTLY DEVERY PROTOCOL IS OPEN SOURCE AND CAN BE USED WITH ANY OTHER SUPPLY CHAIN TOKEN!!! VEN, WTC, TRAC, and many others. The team has said multiple times that their goal is to develop EVE in partnership with the other supply chain teams in crypto.

Is their a major conspiracy going on where Spotify want to render all music dead and worthless? Maybe you can think of one for me. Lots and lots of tech companies run at a loss for ages. It's expected. I suspect Blockstream, one of thousands of blockchain start-ups, has a projected value because some of their devs are original cypherpunks like Satoshi and perhaps they know a thing or two about blockchains as they collectively invented and built them. Maybe their backers see a future world where this blockchain thing becomes a major piece of global technology. In this world many many businesses will need software developed to implement this blockchain thing into their busnesses. Maybe Blockstream will be very well positioned to do that. But before they can this Blockchain thing has to become very very important and successful so maybe Blockstream are allowed to just drive that forward for now by producing software and tools to make Blockchains succeed. Then, then they can make some money. Lot's of fucking money. This is literally how investors value tech companies, it's a long long road. Do you think Whatsapp was making any money when it sold for 22 BILLION? No. It was valued for it's users. Bitcoin needs users. So, Blockstreams business model is to simply make Bitcoin successful.

"To start, I consider success as widespread adoption of bitcoin as a primary currency. That seems to be the general goal of people on this subreddit.

Right, so first let's look at what monetary policy is. At a very high level, it's controlling the supply of money so that prices are stable in a dynamic economy. This is actually done indirectly through securities markets, setting a banking reserve requirement, and lending money to banks. You can look these up on your own if you don't know what they are. If you don't feel like it, monetary policy = managing money supply.

There is plenty of historical precedent for caring about monetary policy. Poor decisions have been disastrous for economies in the past. Most infamous is the Zimbabwean dollar, where the money supply was increased at a rate where economic growth was not keeping up. Hyperinflation ensues because of this mismanagement and the Zimbabwean dollar becomes worthless. Poor decisions can also lead to the flipside, a deflationary currency. Also historically scary stuff. Deflationary policies have been known to exacerbate depressions, inhibit growth, and lower investments spending. The great depression was partly a deflationary spiral where debt causes deflation which leads to increased debt which leads to increased deflation. So since either side of the coin is clearly not desirable, the organization in charge of monetary policy must seek to strike a middle ground. It has been shown that a small amount of inflation is good for an economy so that's the Fed targets an inflation rate and shapes monetary policy around that. 

So, if fiat currency maintains stable prices and stimulates growth through careful manipulation of monetary policy, how does bitcoin approach monetary policy? Well, bitcoin essentially poses the question ""What if we just didn't try?"" No centralized management, anyone can participate in making their own money, and once the cap is reached, money supply is never touched again. Knowing that monetary policy requires such a delicate hand to produce a stable currency, our intuition tells us that this is lunacy. But hey, we really shouldn't dismiss it just because it sounds absolutely terrible. We should dismiss it because it actually is just as terrible as it sounds. 

The effects are essentially equivalent to the Fed taking a hardline contractionary monetary policy. Deflation spirals out of control, real value of debts are increased, depression inhibits or reverses economic growth, and unemployment skyrockets. The worst part is that there's nothing anyone can do about it. There's no central body to say ""hey, things are bad. Let's make them not bad anymore"". Bitcoin commits to not trying to have a monetary policy. So, if it were widely adopted, we'd be forced to just watch it crash and burn. ",1523400132

Roger is a master businessman and manipulator. He can be the leader even if no one ""follows"" him.

"&gt; A paper was published, proving mathematically that SMs can never make money, both revenue and profit decrease for selfish miners.

From my understanding there is no disagreement on this, the threat from selfish mining is that a bad actor could potentially harm the entire without the need for a majority hashrate. They can't make more mining revenue by doing so, but that doesn't mean no one will every try it. It's possible there's more money in shorting Bitcoin futures while performing the SM attack than there is in honest mining. It's also possible there's enough incentive for large state actors to harm Bitcoin in any way they can no matter the cost, SM could be an avenue that they could use to do so.

"&gt;It is.

OK. If you say so, then I guess we'll just need to accept it.

&gt;Why use LN on BTC when LN on something else is even cheaper?

There is no LN on anything else, it wouldn't be cheaper on something else, and because of the lack of serious dev work on it elsewhere. One week ago Blockstream released 7 LApps to the dev community, for free, so they can start building on top of that. That's what will bring adoption - Easy to implement, ready to use solutions, not wishful thinking. And network security - There is no other coin which is as secure as Bitcoin today. If BCH keeps going with no problems, and maintaining its value, is because it's MUCH more profitable for miners to mine Bitcoin than attack BCH. The current has power is &lt;10% of the total, that can be attacked extremely easily. EXTREMELY. 

&gt;No, it's not a problem. Stop with the strawman. No one is proposing 1GB blocks today. Pruning, tech advancements, and software optimizations like Graphene have real potential to address your concerns.

No, it doesn't.  I'm not talking block propagation (graphene) or storage (cheap HDD), but syncing up from scratch, validating the full blockchain from zero, in case something goes wrong. Which it always does.

Nielsen's law of bandwith gets you 50% increase in speed every year. It held true for the past 30yr, so that's the best case scenario. With 1MB blocks the network today adds ~50GB to the blockchain per year. with 2MB blocks it adds ~66% to the blockchain. With 3MB it adds ~100%. And so on.This means that **TODAY**, not in 10 years, with 3 measly MB blocks, the blockchain increases by 100%, so ***faster than tech improves***. Not strawman, this is reality. This means if it takes, say, ~4hrs on modern hardware to sync up a full node, next year it will take ~6hrs! (100% increased blockchain, by 50% faster internet.) You can do the maths on your own on a long term... just remember Nielsen law for Internet bandwidth and Moore law for hardware advances, not more. 

(Now you can Google around easily and you'll find more than one article which discusses that Moore's law has already come to a halt, but let's assume it's still valid. Doesn't change the conclusion above.)

&gt;BCH didn't collapse forking to 8MB

talking about effective block size, bytes written on a disk, not some fictional limit.

&gt;I rather have money for everyone that can support 10 billion users with a million nodes than one with 10 million users and 100k nodes.

Ironically, that's what Bitcoin will give you, not BCH. It is fairly accepted in this community that at scale BCH will consist in giant miners and server farms... you won't have a million of those. Guaranteed.  A million RasPi's running nodes with small blocks? Much more likely.


&gt;I am against segwit's arbitrary decision on block weight,

Not arbitrary... 

&gt;how regular TX are more expensive that segwit ones

So cheap txs are all of a sudden a problem?

&gt;how it's done as a soft fork

Keeps the legacy chain alive and kicking... Especially given what happened with BCH, it's kinda obvious that Miners would have stayed with the legacy chain. And so would have businesses. Guess which chain would have been the Bitcoin chain then? Soft forks prevent this kind of attack. A perfectly played hand by the devs, and fulyl supported by myself and others.

&gt;when no one really wanted it 

Everyone wanted it. Or better, users wanted it. Of course businesses prefer big blocks, it externalizes costs for them.. no need to write high quality code to use the new features!

.I read that paper. Granted I'm no expert but it makes the assumption that miners can clear out the mempool. If bitcoin (BCH plz) becomes a worldwide money, I don't think the mempool will ever clear out.

Hmmm.... if the mempool doesn't clear out, how are you gonna prevent high fees? Non-empty mempool = competition to get in block = fee market. Back at square one ;-)

&gt; Regardless, an equilibrium will form where miners will mine the biggest blocks (to maximize fees/profit) that will still propagate faster than the dishonest miner. I believe that paper will be something theoretical but not practical like the 51% attack. Again, I'm not an expert.

Re-read the paper carefully... The scenario described is very real.

&gt;But bitcoin has been working for years without hitting the limit (effective no blocksize limit) and it has been working beautifully.

Yes, because of the block reward. Nobody argues with that. A fee market would not be necessary if we had a constant block reward. But that's inflationary, and changes one of the fundamental assumptions in Bitcoin. Do you wanna do that? (Btw, and remember my words, in due time you'll see the community argue over this very topic - Should we hard fork to make the block reward constant? Introduce inflation, that is. One of the arguments will be ""Satoshi was not an economist!"". Keep in mind, I promise it will happen.)

&gt;I mean, you can decentralize even more with smaller blocks...

That's exactly what LukeJr wants to do... but he's also the only one, I think. We're in a relatively good spot now, let's keep it that way.

&gt;1MB limit --&gt; fees go up --&gt; users find alternatives

Yes, plastic. Fiat works perfectly fine. Once BTC is ready for prime time, then it will be a different story.


&gt;The BTC/altcoin ratio gets higher and higher at every bubble. This is what will play out eventually.  I can't say for sure if there will be a 'flippening' but if the 1MB limit isn't raised, there's good chance it will happen.

And I welcome competition!!! It will be tough though to compete on fees, LN really does that extremely well. But sidechains (RSK) and drivechains are going to be part of the final picture, precisely for the cases Erik mentioned. So what? What's the problem with having a single coin as reference, a reserve coin, with many other coins for specific use cases?? I actually think this is the most likely case. No problems with that. And if one of these coins is BCH, so be it. 


&gt;You might, but most will move on to other coins that aren't crippled. Don't let decentralization fetishism cloud your judgement.

Sorry, but Bitcoin is either decentralized and trustless, or it's not Bitcoin. We have centrally issued coins today, no need for energy waste if we end up with PayPal 2.0/crypto central banking. High fees are the price to pay for decentralization, and I'm OK with it.


&gt;edit: also LN will need bigger blocks anyway so I don't see why it couldn't happen in 2015 even just to 4MB.

Again, it's to keep the blockchain small. If blocks were not small, companies would not have started working on using SegWit - Why would they, it's only cost for them! Nor batching, the single most efficiency improvement tool at our disposal to rationalize blockchain use. Why bother, if everything can be dumped on the blockchain like you just took shit, and it doesn't cost you a thing? Small blocks forced people to implement all of this. 

It was painful, sure, but absolutely necessary. It's part of scaling... growing pains.

This is the true reason I believe in supporting bitcoin so adamantly. not because I think it is the answer, but becuse it serves as a proof of concept. proof that we can have a system where trust is irrelevant because save for the exception of a hack (nothing is perfect) the system itself dissolves that requirement, by creating a lack of incentive to do so.

money makes the world turn as the saying goes. well if we can have a decentralized currency, than that proves we can have a decentralized government where no one entity is in charge. A truly free institution run by the people, all people, for the people.

of course we are still a far ways off, but computers do as they are told and have nothing to gain. its also worth noting that the AI sentience problem is irrelevnt inthe main system as one would only need that for judgement and not function.

The only real concern here is that a human will still need the write the initial code. that on in a billion person, truly pure and free of corruption. so without that special enlightened individual the whole game could be rigged from the start. no matter how rare, now we just need one exception being to free us from ourselves instead of relying on millions.

BCH just chooses to distance themselves from every other crypto claiming they’re the best. This will ultimately be their downfall.

BCH supporters will say that LN creates centralization, but bear in mind Bitcoin has the Segwit properties too.

"The ""fractional teller banking"" problem is the more obvious one.  As I've written before:

The proposed LN obviously isn't traditional fully-custodial ""banking"" (i.e. you put the coins in the bank's vault and only they hold the key). But *neither* is it the ""be your own bank"" of Bitcoin proper (the coins are in your own vault and only you hold the key). It's kind of a hybrid model where you and your bank / hub both lend funds to an entity (the channel) over which control is shared.  It's an interesting idea and it might even ""work,"" i.e. prove useful for certain niche use cases.  But... it has nothing to do with scaling Bitcoin.  Borrowing from a previous comment of mine:

A LN payment that takes the form of updating the state of an open channel (which obviously occurs off-chain) is a necessarily imperfect substitute for a payment that takes the form of an actual, confirmed, on-chain transaction. How can you get defrauded in the latter case? If the person paying you manages to pull off a double spend. The good news is changing the public history of transactions in such a manner ""quickly becomes computationally impractical for an attacker... if honest nodes control a majority of CPU power."" How can you get defrauded in the former case? Well, the nature of the LN is such that if one party closes a channel in an old state in an attempt to steal from you, you must act to block the attempted theft by getting your own ""breach remedy transaction"" added to the blockchain within a defined ""dispute period."" That is a fundamentally different (and weaker) security model. It depends on a user's supposed ability to, when needed, get an on-chain transaction confirmed on the blockchain in a timely manner which is of course exactly what's compromised by imposing an arbitrary constraint on on-chain capacity. It's what I call [the LN's ""fractional-teller banking"" problem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4rdkiy/heres_how_bitcoins_lightning_network_could_fail/d50akqm/)  **The fundamental problem is that when you move transactions onto a ""second layer,"" you have, by definition, added a layer of risk. And that risk increases the more the main chain is artificially constrained -- the smaller your ""base,"" the more precarious the structures built on top of it.** 

But an even simpler way to see why the LN isn't some magical free lunch that eliminates the need for actual (i.e., on-chain) scaling is to consider some basic math. Payment channels require on-chain transactions for their creation. Well, at 3 tx/sec it would take the world's 7 billion people a minimum of about 76 years (!) to each make a single on-chain transaction.",1523396934

"Since the ICO ist about to end in a little more than 12 hours I would like to post a quick update.

First of all It is more than obvious that the team of Socratescoin tried to bury any negative comments on the [thread](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2937986.160) at Bitcointalk with a lot of more or less aged accounts. A lot of the posts were removed but at lesat 8 pages are still there.

A lot of people have reached out to me claiming and proving that they have been scammed by Manuel Batista and others. Speaking of Manuel Batista, look at [this](https://imgur.com/a/JZnXP). Crypto is all new to him and them? Hell no! That tomain was leading to (this)[https://www.facebook.com/allstarfactorycrypto/app/552566374767422/] site on facebook which is called Allstarfactory Crypto. It looks pretty similar to Peter Gurschler´s Allstarfactory Health which can be also found on (facebook)[https://www.facebook.com/fgxakademie/]. That is from just a year ago which didn´t stop Manuel Batista from trying MLM with (RAIN)[http://rainintl.com/home] at the same time. The more we were digging the more shit we found. It is too much to describe it all.

What is more interesting is that all the partner institutions either denied to work with Socratescoin or the Nauka university or just did not respond most likely because they are a front too.

"&gt; It's use as a currency went down dramatically all through 2017 to the point, where it was all but impossible to use as a currency.

this is not true at all. its use was increasing all the way through 2017, which led to the escalated problem of lack of blocksize space. this exasberated problem then led to extremely high transaction fees. BTC was still usable, just very expensive, and/or slow. 

&gt; Bitcoin transactions were taking longer to clear than it takes a bank check.

yes they were. however, this does not make Bitcoin (or even Bitcoin in that three month period you talk about) not a currency. it just makes it an extremely logjammed crypto network. 

&gt; The situation has improved, mostly due to much lower transaction volume

yes it has improved - it's good of you to notice. yes, it is due to less transactions. however, this is not indicitive of BTC not being a currency. The downward trend is due to an overall contraction of the crypto sphere, wouldn't you say? of course, if you have evidence to the contrary, i am all ears.

so why is the LN being built then? 

i mean it doesn't make sense that people are using the LN to make p2p payments with a token that is not a currency does it? how odd.

What about cross chain swaps that are envisaged as happening on LN in the near future?

why would someone do that with a store of value? that makes no sense.

"An Ethic Professor from Eindhoven University of Engineering said that engineering = social engineering in the sense that many engineering developments are reshaping the world and our way of thinking, and as such many conform our social norms and then end as laws.

The first engineering ethic value is that it should improve our world. Which were the incentives of this man. Which was his long term trend.

The break things policy is behind improving society. Was he really improving society? 

Long ago there was a crime called magnicide or regicide, not sure. Maybe we should create one named ""Democricide"": 

+ Centralizing too much press discouraging political discourse. 
+ Trying to create narratives on millions alienating inalienable human rights trying to maximize some obscure benefit for hidden players because they are brought to the world through societies or associations of obscure origin.
+ Not fighting against Torquemada Inquisition like non argumentation narratives that we all know how they have ended in the past.

At least until we can bring some crypto based truth to this world of deep fake and everything fake where noone can believe anything as meatworld is increasingly mixed with data world. 

In the same way we are very cautious with medicines, shouldn't the ""medicines"", ""ideals"" and ""drugs"" we as society and democracy swallow in our ""common brain""? 

Shouldn't we try to protect the ""data in"" we get as society so we get the best ""data out"" conclusions, reducing the information arbitrage and divergences that lead us to confrontations and resource waste and misallocation. Wouldn't improve our adaptability, reduce our resource waste, bring faster and better conclusions, using some system that effectively reduces the message transfer noise between us. 

Difficult issue, how to verify datasource validity without discouraging or censoring the full spectre testing all possible ideas from anyone. Only accepting some specific truth would be undemocratic, unhuman, would disallow whistleblowing necessary in some specific circumstances. It would prevent social advance aswell as it would have if racial, religious ideas had not been allowed to flourish in the past.

Maybe the answer is not in ""truth"" from players that aso defect many times from the common good but in high power positions never get found and end in cronyism. Maybe Data purity certification/standarization from source to destination using hashed and linked metatags with the data itself?

2 parts ($133) in a 'next 10' coin. This is actually the big bet, this is the one that you hope will get you that poolside villa in the Carribean. For me that'd be one of Ripple, IOTA, Monero, but other similar choices are valid. This where you hope to see the growth in the portfolio. It could take a long time to get there, it probably never will, but if any part of your portfolio gets you to a million it'd probably be this choice.

Lastly 1 part ($66) in a shit-coin, I mean pick an out-there longshot from the top50-250 coins. This is your rollercoaster coin. This is so you have something to give you interest when you log in to see your daily up/down. Enjoying this rollercoaster is there so you don't fuck around touching the rest of your holding.

But honestly? I don't personally hold any crypto and I can't advise others do the same. I wouldn't invest $400 unless part of a much much larger portfolio ($40k+). Stocks pay dividends, bonds mature, and cash pays interest. Cryptocurrency is a purely speculative asset, from that perspective it's fun to keep an eye on so if you're intested buy (I won't call it investing) with that in mind.",1523395787

"As someone who deals with wallet UX on a daily basis and with customers who are very new to cryptocurrency, this is an upsetting and wrongly handled update to the Bitcoin.com wallet, in my opinion.

* The wallet now doesn't show a BTC wallet by default. This is fine if that's the direction Bitcoin.com wants to go (BCH-only), but it would be preferable if they gave users an option upon install of what they want to display. Coinomi does that upon new installations, for example.

Instead, the Bitcoin.com wallet launches with the usual Copay ready message, saying that ""On this screen you can see all your wallets, accounts, and assets."" That sentence should be modified or removed.

* **Most concerning:** My existing installation of Bitcoin.com *had* an existing BTC balance and the upgrade hid that wallet without alerting me or showing any concern for those funds. Newbies who suddenly see their BTC wallet disappear will be understandably panicked. Many of them may not know how to turn it back on. Others may forget that they had a BTC balance and never check.

"YES, it's mostly batching, and NO outputs are not a better measurement at all. Here is why:

Imagine you are an exchange and want to pay 100 customers.

Before batching you sent 100 transactions, each with 2 outputs one for the customer and one for the change address. Thus you have 200 outputs in total.

After batching you send 1 transaction, each with 101 outputs, 100 for the customers and 1 change address.

Thus, as you can see not only the transaction numbers can drop significantly (100-&gt;1) and drastically, but also the outputs (200-&gt;101) will nearly halve for every batched transaction. You only need one or two batched transactions in every block and you're freeing up a bunch of space and reducing transaction numbers significantly. If you look at any random block you will see a bunch of batches transactions. It's very common to see 10-20 outputs, and its not uncommon to see 80-100 outputs within one transaction.

On top of this, we now have lightning and lots of people are using it surprisingly a this very early stage. Bitrefill reported tons of live transactions and now services like coincards.ca and others accept LN payments too. None of these BTC payments show on the blockchain relieving the main chain from thousands of transactions a day.

BCH tx fees are 1 satoshi per byte.  So a block size of 1.25GB can contain 12.5 BCH in tx fees for the miners without any need for a fee market.

1.25GB per 10minutes = 16 Mbit/sec.  Fibre optic is being laid ***today*** that is bringing gigabit internet to peoples homes.  In no world does the tech not keep up with increasing block sizes.  Remember we are talking about a dev group that refused to increase the block size to ***2MB*** and I'm talking about the feasability of a **1000x** larger increase.

There was ***no reason*** for the core dev team to not increase the block size to 2MB instead of letting BTC choke on $50USD fees per transaction.  People were spending more in tx fees per day than on their actual monthly internet bill.

"This line nicely sums up an important point I've been thinking about for a while:

When attempting to unearth the investor sentiment surrounding bitcoin, we can look at the trading behaviour of the top bitcoin holders. Looking at the top 100 richest bitcoin addresses there seems to be a clear strategy, accumulate, accumulate, and accumulate. As stated earlier, the sell-off that we have been witnessing in the past 4 months is a result of impatient and inexperienced investors who were going through a major FOMO phase. The idea of becoming 'rich' within a few months was entertained by major newspapers around the world. This introduced the notion that 'cryptocurrency is the investment of a lifetime', but as we saw in 2011 and 2013, if these impulsive investors don't get their riches quick, they'll be the first to sell. These are most likely the same people that have prematurely planned their lambo purchase. ",1523394101

&gt;In the selfish miner model, μn=Yn if the event {Xn=ti} occurs and μn=0 if {Xn=ti} does not occur. This means that Sn(ti,ω) and ∑k=1..n Yk represent the total gain. In the later equation, the total amount available to be “won” from following the selfish miner strategy after the first n trials.

&gt;Remark

&gt;In the above gambling model μn=Yn if the event {Xn=ti} occurs and μn=0 if {Xn=ti} does not occur. Hence Sn(ti,ω) and ∑k=1..n Yk represent, respectively, the total gain and the total amount winnable of the bettor at the first n trials[...]

"I am providing a hypothetical about discounting lost coins, without practical implications, so an argument that this would somehow impact blockchain immutability is erroneous.  If we were discussing what would happen if those coins were somehow removed from the blockchain, that would be a different story.  You are assuming the demand created by perceived max supply is not significant, without evidence.  I will not deny this is possible, but without evidence of this effect, the opposite is too.  I will not argue whether the effect is significant or not; simply that it exists.  Where I make assumptions is as follows:

* the loss of value from discounting lost coins is offset by the reduction in perceived supply, assuming we could accurately determine these values and have them reflected in market cap and max supply (in simple terms, we would lose far more coins than the value of those coins)
* the result would have limited effect on coin value, and if any, I think it would likely increase the value
* the removal of the initial cost of lost coins would have minimal effects on market cap, keeping btc at the top

I am still searching for one more spectacular leak, which was information allegedly divulged to Chinese miners as a marketing pitch for Lightning.
It described how fee revenue would essentially move from layer 1 (Bitcoin) to the LN layer. It was of course a pitch to get miners to believe LN was a good idea and at least ""fee neutral"" for them, if they ran a LN node, i.e. became a ""liquidity provider"".",1523393322

"&gt; It's not. 

It is. Frankly, I don't know why devs joined a project they thought wouldn't work. I wish they created their own coin and squabble between themselves what block size limit is the best.

https://bitcoindebates.miraheze.org/wiki/Against_large_blocks#Positive_effects_of_high_fees

https://medium.com/@elliotolds/is-now-the-right-time-for-higher-bitcoin-fees-7c820738d4f0


&gt; I don't understand why do many seem to believe the two are mutually exclusive. I can send on-chain payments if I have a large txs, or buy coffee with LN. One does not preclude the other. And by buying coffee off-chain, I keep the base layer less congested, thus reducing the fees for on-chain txs.

Because when LN isn't even ready and fees are sky rocketing, people who don't want to pay fees look for alternatives. BCH, ETH, XMR etc. BTC dominance has been on a constant downhill. Let's say LN is up and running. Why use LN on BTC when LN on something else is even cheaper?

&gt; Not accurate. Blocks are kept at 1MB to keep the blockchain small. Blocchain bloat is a real problem, for every coin. And not a problem of storage, but of time required to sync a full node, bandwidth basically, mining node or not. Example: Say block size is 1GB. Effective space, not limits. In one year, you will add ~50TB of data to the blockchain. And then another 50TB. And then again. Nielsen's law of bandwidth says 50% faster every year. But with ever increasing blocks, you quickly reach the stage where you just cannot sync up a full node, not even as a high end user. This is because the blockchain grows faster than tech improves. Or in the very best case, only a few super users will be able to do it. AKA, extreme centralization. Neither of these two options is acceptable to me.

No, it's not a problem. Stop with the strawman. No one is proposing 1GB blocks today. Pruning, tech advancements, and software optimizations like Graphene have real potential to address your concerns. BCH didn't collapse forking to 8MB. Decentralization is a sliding scale not binary. I rather have money for everyone that can support 10 billion users with a million nodes than one with 10 million users and 100k nodes. That's why I got into bitcoin in the first place. It is also for people who live on less than $2 a day, not only people who can afford on chain fees. LN hubs has its own centralization problems.

&gt; SegWit was first and foremost a malleability fix, which is recognized as necessary on BCH as well. Not the only possible solution, but a solution indeed. It also allows, or better simplifies, LN. Note: LN can run without malleability fix, so SegWit is NOT needed for LN, only the current simplified implementation relies on it.

I am not against a malleability fix. I'm sure there will be one (a proper one not like segwit) when it's needed. I am against segwit's arbitrary decision on block weight, how regular TX are more expensive that segwit ones, how it's done as a soft fork (only as segwit2x debacle) when no one really wanted it (still hovering at only 30% for having 'consensus'). That doesn't sound like centralization to you? 

&gt; A fee market is absolutely necessary for the long term survival of Bitcoin, more info here.

I read that paper. Granted I'm no expert but it makes the assumption that miners can clear out the mempool. If bitcoin (BCH plz) becomes a worldwide money, I don't think the mempool will ever clear out. Regardless, an equilibrium will form where miners will mine the biggest blocks (to maximize fees/profit) that will still propagate faster than the dishonest miner. I believe that paper will be something theoretical but not practical like the 51% attack. Again, I'm not an expert.

But bitcoin has been working for years without hitting the limit (effective no blocksize limit) and it has been working beautifully. 

&gt; You may say ""OK, but we don't need it today!"". To which I reply, ""Why not?"" Who is to decide when is the fee market necessary?

Yes, who is to decide? I say no one that's why I'm for bigger blocks (no limit). Core is taking that up upon themselves to decide. Is it not centralization for you yet? I mean, you can decentralize even more with smaller blocks... 

&gt; Hate it as much as you will, but the fees on Bitcoin are the best possible insurance for Bitcoin's network security. So long as there's fees, miners will never leave Bitcoin. Why?
&gt; Miners leave --&gt; Fees go up --&gt; Mining profitability goes up --&gt; Miners return
This is not just a theoretical argument, we've seen this play out in Nov/Dec last year very well.

I never said bitcoin shouldn't have fees. Miner can still profit with high volume, low cost TX. The reality is:

1MB limit --&gt; fees go up --&gt; users find alternatives

The BTC/altcoin ratio gets higher and higher at every bubble. [This is what will play out eventually. ](http://moneyandstate.com/the-parable-of-alpha-a-lesson-in-network-effect-game-theory/) I can't say for sure if there will be a 'flippening' but if the 1MB limit isn't raised, there's good chance it will happen.

&gt; I am a strong supporter of small blocks, and happy to pay for network insurance in the form of fees.

At current $260 billion cap, the whole crypto space is about the size of Wal-Mart. That's not nothing, but it's just one publicly-traded company. It's really not worth the time of all these Wall Streeters to simply crush this relatively tiny market right now when so much more money could be made letting it grow (they believe they can always kill it later if it gets out of control).",1523392554

"Bitcoin core is not a fork. It has always maintained it's own path. It didn't change direction or codebase. BCH forked and split into a different direction. It is an offshoot of btc.  
  
Obviously btc is synonymous with the coin... named bitcoin so yes every owner of btc is being slighted when bch tries to steal the brand bitcoin and confuse the market on what is the original and actual bitcoin. This is marketing 101. Every owner of btc is being slighted when someone uses the bitcoin twitter handle and pretends to be someone part of btc but really is trying to tarnish the product. This is why no real company can claim the name ""coke different"" or ""coke blue"" or whatever. BCH tries to minimize using the word bitcoin when referring to btc and maximize the word when referencing bch. To be clear, I don't mind both sharing the name but it should be seperate and clear to the market. I do mind the confusion in the marketplace purposely and deceptively. I don't mind the copying of the ledger. It's a smart move to make money out of this air if successful but be clear that it is now and forever more a different, distinct and separate product. Ethereum doesn't have this problem because both sides are clear on what they are and that's how it should work. 
  
""You're advocating censorship?""
I'm advocating truth and honesty not ""fake news."" There is a difference. There is a reason websites get taken away when they don't belong to the real world business. Being first to take the website name or twitter or any social media doesn't mean it was first to use the name in the real world. It's deceptive to take the name and pretend to be the real bitcoin currency and disparage it for the benefit of an alt coin. You already can't do it with a website, you can't do it in social media or anywhere else without being opened to to legal liability. It doesn't matter how long the user owned the name. The name existed prior to the person acquiring the handle. Bitcoin was around long before the user took the name on twitter. He only acquired it on twitter because it already existed in the real world. He didn't just spontaneously make up the name. It has whats called ""prior art"" in the real world. I --am-- advocating seizure so the rightful owners of the twitter handle get the name that should belong and does belong to them. According to your words, since it wasn't purchased, the person the handle was seized from deserves no money as compensation for him having the handle and then it getting seized. His ""property"" has no financial worth to him and he paid nothing for it. That user is free to get a handle of something like ""ilovebch"",""ihatebtc"" or whatever and fairly and honestly cry his heart out to the world on how bad btc really is. He does not have the right to masquerade as a real world product or devs or whatever and hide behind the anonymity of the internet to troll the product his is pretending to be. It's analogous to you going in public and saying your a cop to intimidate people. That's bs and illegal in the real world but the world hasnt quite caught up with crypto since it's a new industry yet the law is grey for now but won't be for long.",1523392192

By contrast, an 8MB block limit can accommodate approximately 700% increase in transaction capacity and a max block size of 8MB. Transactions with large signatures pay per byte so they are not discouraged (LN would be expensive to settle on chain).

"&gt; It was in response to the block(the)stream ""literally killing babies"" thing you mentioned a little up in the thread

Were done with that. There is no evidence this is the case.

&gt; The problem is if bitcoin ever recovers from the big dump its sent the market into and becomes popular again, fees will rise, and double spends will become more likely.

As I said, pay the fee and get in the block. 

&gt; With BCH its nearly impossible to double spend

Uh huh... so how impossible is that? We both know double spending is not secure. Its inherently a broken method, and a complete liability to build the system around. Imagine bcash gets popular and everyone are doing 0-conf. One day an asshole government decides to run its small 1% hashpower mining pool that mines double spends for you. This glaring open hole is unfixable, and can decimate trust if an actor decides to attack the coin. With confirmed payments you need 51% hashpower to doublespend. With 0-conf the chance of doublespending is proportional to hashpower, and even at very low rates this would make the system insecure.

&gt; With RBF on top of that makes accepting 0-conf even more dangerous, even though you can just ignore rbf transactions.

lol... so you're saying that even if you ignore RBF transactions when doing 0-conf its more dangerous. You're not making sense.

&gt; I mean call it what you want, but in my mind it's a fix to a issue that has been in bitcoin forever.

Why? Its been working fine so far. Its a sign that bitcoin is the dominant crypto. No other crypto can run the same hashing algo and bitcoin DAA. They would be crushed. Its not a bug. Its there to make sure forks die if they don't have support, which is why bcash needed to change the DAA. An even more ironic point is that bcash supposedly thinks that miners are important players. With the bcash DAA miners have no power as the DAA will always make sure that the network will function even without majority hashpower. Nodes can essentially dictate concensus rules. Miners have no choice but to follow. They wouldn't be able to starve the chain of blocks like on bitcoin.

&gt;  it would be unable to confirm transactions more than once or so an hour, and fees would rise uncontrollably as people rush to get their coins on exchanges to avoid having to spend 50-80% on fees like they had to for the past year. 

and yet bitcoin still survived just fine. 

&gt; Now BCH never has these hyperinflation periods,

what are you talking about? Remember the EDA?

&gt;  but with with BTC on the other hand I can see this being used as a really good attack vector in the future.

its a shitty attack vector. Bitcoin will always be the most valuable crypto. If you want to starve btc of hashpower you will have to match the blockreward... and the fees that will increase rapidly. My guess its cheaper right now to fill blocks with tx' than to match the blockreward.

&gt; And also went up in price to 0.5 BTC regardless, and brought bitcoin to dump over 70% in the matter of hours in the most profitable month of trading I had all 2017. 

And that 0.5 BTC price was a rubber band nailed to the ground. It could have gone to 1 BTC and it would have done the same. People can trade back and forth and push the price to the moon with a few coins, but when people get the opportunity to dump for that price its going to hit the ground like a ton of bricks, which is exactly what we saw. That was the biggest single pump and dump scheme in crypto history, even with a complete troll factory attacking social media at the same time (even if rbtc claims it was orchestrated by maxwell and luke jr. like wtf)

And what we see now is the same we've seen with bcash all along. Its gets a pump (BCH/BTC) and price slowly slides because no one really believes in it. This happens all the time, but the pumps keep on getting smaller, and the slides longer and longer. Its not even got more tx action that dogecoin lol.",1523390231

"&gt;If SMs control a&gt;1/3, they get a disproportionate share of blocks onto the blockchain. Once da kicks in they will get more revenue as well

There is no proof for this statement. Emin has only proved the following:

&gt;If SM activity is undetectable, and honest miners carry on with business as usual indefinitely after selfish miners go rogue, then it takes selfish miners only a&gt;1/3 to increase their revenue long term.

The premise ""selfish mining activity is undetectable and honest miners carry on with business as usual in the presence of selfish mining activity"" is false therefore the conclusion is wrong as well.

CSW's paper proves that regardless of whether HM reacts or not, bitcoin mining is better represented by an Erlang distribution and selfish miners' would decrease even if honest miners were dumb. 

You cannot refute none. ",1523390185

You seem unable to fathom what it's like to care about truth first and foremost, to not to be a status seeker intellectual obsessed with self righteously declaring how you would never-ever-ever do a dishonorable thing like repurpose text with slight modification for Bitcoin purposes when you think it really needed no re-inventing of the wheel. 

If you'd instead go out of your way to virtue-signal by completely rewriting stuff that doesn't need to be rewritten, or making it abundantly clear by throwing up your hands and disclaiming ""this mathematical method was not my idea guys! i'm just quoting Komolgorov don't stone me!"" when anyone in the field would know this mathematical method was in use long before. 

I mean seriously, put down your pitchfork and think for a second. Plagiarism is bad because you are claiming credit for another human's work. If it's equations, you are stealing their credit for coming up with their math. but ONLY if it isn't commonly known in the field (and not sourced). If it is prose you're quoting you'd be taking unjust credit for writing fine prose that was someone else's baby. When it's a friggin' technical paper with dry exposition it's a lazyass thing to do but if it is short and modified somewhat *and* referenced, who really cares? It's not like he is claiming credit for coming up with a mathematical method created by someone else, and it's not like he is he getting credit for his master wordsmithing. He is being lazy. Some would say efficient. He is not getting undeserved credit for another's hard work and ingenuity. 

All the card-carrying members of science club so obsessed with whether someone would accuse you of plagiarism that you go out of your way not to repurpose perfectly good prose by adjusting it mildly for Bitcoin purposed make it obvious your habitual instinct is to think first about your image and standing as a **Member of the Scientific Community** &lt;space echo effect&gt; and only consider actual pursuit of truth as an afterthought, a mere means to your real ultimate end of increasing your standing in said community.

"&gt; Will be interesting to see how the CSW muppet crew spins this.

I'm actually of the opinion CSW is in fact Satoshi, or at least a key person in a team known as Satoshi. This development makes perfect sense. From my understanding CSW worked in some significant capacity at Charles Sturt University as a researcher. He is a person who said himself he loves knowledge, and I'd add to that the appearance of genius. He has more than one PhD. So during his research he comes across Dr. Adam Back's Hashcash and, having a background in cryptography (not sure where he gained that) saw potential for what would later become Bitcoin. Most others thought the idea was too insane to work. Greg Maxwell even to this day holds the opinion it's simply impossible for ""Bitcoin"" to actually work, because you can't scale it on-chain (supposedly).

Wright, however, believed it could work. He seeks out others to help him with pieces of the puzzle he's not sure about. JVP, who would later realize it was Wright he talked to about Bitcoin years after it started, had  suggested he code the project in C++:

It's not. I don't understand why do many seem to believe the two are mutually exclusive. I can send on-chain payments if I have a large txs, or buy coffee with LN. One does not preclude the other. And by buying coffee off-chain, I keep the base layer less congested, thus reducing the fees for on-chain txs.


&gt; Core deliberately kept the 1MB to forcefully spur segwit and LN development

Not accurate. Blocks are kept at 1MB to keep the blockchain small. Blocchain bloat is a real problem, for every coin. And not a problem of storage, but of time required to sync a full node, bandwidth basically, mining node or not. Example: Say block size is 1GB. Effective space, not limits. In one year, you will add ~50TB of data to the blockchain. And then another 50TB. And then again. Nielsen's law of bandwidth says 50% faster every year. But with ever increasing blocks, you quickly reach the stage where you just cannot sync up a full node, not even as a high end user. This is because the blockchain grows faster than tech improves. Or in the very best case, only a few super users will be able to do it. AKA, extreme centralization. Neither of these two options is acceptable to me.

&amp;nbsp;

SegWit was first and foremost a malleability fix, which is recognized as necessary on BCH as well. Not the only possible solution, but a solution indeed. It also allows, or better simplifies, LN. Note: LN can run without malleability fix, so SegWit is NOT needed for LN, only the current simplified implementation relies on it.

&gt;artificial fee market

A fee market is absolutely necessary for the long term survival of Bitcoin, more info [here](http://randomwalker.info/publications/mining_CCS.pdf).

You may say ""OK, but we don't need it today!"". To which I reply, ""Why not?"" Who is to decide when is the fee market necessary?

Hate it as much as you will, but the fees on Bitcoin are the **best possible insurance** for Bitcoin's network security. So long as there's fees, miners will never leave Bitcoin. Why?

* Miners leave --&gt; Fees go up --&gt; Mining profitability goes up --&gt; Miners return


This is not just a theoretical argument, we've seen this play out in Nov/Dec last year very well.

Bitcoin is the blockchain with the most accumulated work, most stakeholders[1], and having a genesis block with hash `000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f`

"7% may seem high but the average BTM fee is 8.54%, the average **buy** fee is 9.04%, I'll always beat the average fee or go out of business trying.  

https://coinatmradar.com/charts/

Why so high? Well, BTM owners/operators use exchanges themselves (but spare you the risk of putting your balance on the exchange), so we pay the exchange fees and assume the usual risk. We also need to maintain liquidity at the exchange to provide the service, moneys which could be invested elsewhere or at least earning interest. Then, with many manufacturers they collect a percentage of profit as a residual for hardware and software support. We also have banking fees for deposits and moving funds to the exchange. We typically pay the host venue some percentage where the BTM is located, for footprint, data and electricity. There's costs to launching a business, licensing, logo, websites, and so on. Smart operators have insurance. If the operation requires assistants they need to get paid. With all this it's not unreasonable for the people building physical on and off ramps to want to make a profit, it's considerable time, trouble and risk. And it's sustained risk, these machines take time to pay for themselves. Did I mention the cost of buying such things? I'll let you browse: https://coinatmradar.com/manufacturers/   

In the end I do this to help the world integrate bitcoin in everyday life. I charge below average fees because I want to be a good ambassador, there's no competition from other BTMs in the cities where mine are located.

"&gt; Like the governments which are about to be destroyed by crypto? Why aren't they just throwing their weight around to stop it? Because they can't, that's exactly the point, this mechanism allows us to ignore their interference, not involve them in trade at all, cut them out of the loop entirely and they won't have even visibility into what's going on. Any ""proto-state"" that wants to come along and execute their same strategy has to deal with the territory that killed them, and therefore will inevitably fail.

The old powers weren't adapted to crypto; the new guys will be. Good crypto just removes one route to unrestrained power, but other routes still remain; crypto only covers the issue of central banks and centralized money transmitters and such, but people have reached unreasonable levels of power above others for milenia before central banks and stuff got in the scene.

&gt; Then whatever infrastructure you erect will necessarily be too high above others and you have failed, further, people will use crypto to subvert it, because by nature if it can impose things upon them they did not freely choose. The best you can do is allow the natural order to assert itself, end of story. Free market currencies immune from tampering by political authorities will do that, it's what they are for.

Again, we can't expect crypto to solve all problems; we need to continue the work started by Satoshi, extend it to new fields; stay vigilant and try to ensure the mistakes of the past arent repeated. You're still thining about it in the old way, you're forgetting about the lessons Bitcoin has taught us; a central authority might not be necssary if the system is designed properly and enough of the participants are well educated and informed in the relevant matters.

&gt; This is one of my concerns actually, the population needs to get savvy enough to realise that their traditional protector, who has become their slavemaster and is corrupted beyond redemption, is going away. Consequently, they need to have enough stake in the new system that they cannot simply be steam-rolled over by someone naturally at the top of it. I fear that there are too many stupid people in the world, and that they will not understand this, and terrible things will result.

It's one of the reasons we need to not let things run wild; we need to figure out how to ensure the participants of the system won't have perverse incetives that will lead them to disrupt the system. If we just let things happen organically, we're opening ourselves to the risk of repeating history. I don't got all the answers for how we should do things, but being are of a problem is the first step to solving it.

&gt; Right, but with the tools of cryptocurrencies, I think it actually does. We may not like how that actually turns out, depending on how the global population at large responds to it, but there's little doubt that the traditional mechanisms of interference are obsolete against properly employed cryptocurrencies.

Crypto takes a huge bite off the problem, but it doesn't block all routes, and might even facilitate a few. Have you seen those scifi things where instead of countries, or even planets, it's corporations that rule over people, and they got big enough that they can do whatever they want regardless of the consequences to the population? That's pretty much where we're heading once central banks and conventional goverments are out of the way; crypto by itself won't do much to stop that, and might even accelerate it. We need to somehow extend the Bitcoin design principles into other areas, ensure that everywhere that matters, participants will clearly benefit more by doing what is best for humanity and any behavior that has bad consequences for the population also punishes those engaging in it even if under unrestrained conditions it would be beneficial to then. Bitcoin is taking care of the raw financial aspect, but we still need to bitcoinize everything else.",1523387614

"That's fair. In another part of the daily thread, I had an argument with a person who claimed that ""99% of all alts die."" In the course of trying to refute his points, I discovered that if you had invested $20 in each of the 20 bottom currencies from a date they arbitrarily selected, you would have lost $320 and gained $19,000, which is 62% more than you would have earned investing in BTC on the same date. (All numbers assume that you sell today, not at the peak.)

With that in mind, I'm feeling pretty good about spreading things out with $25 investments in the lesser alts. For top-50 coins, I want to have at least $100, but for anything else, I think spreading things out spreads out some of the risk. ",1523386530

"I'll give it a go.  First off, there is some bad feeling over the ban for two reasons.  1) it was implemented in response to the actions of a very small number and was not reconsidered when remedial action was taken.  A couple of mods took a very snooty and poorly reasoned approach to the whole thing and it seemed as if they were driven by emotion and being offended rather than the aim to achieve a better outcome. 2) Rather than just limiting the ban to posts about VEN, the mods took the absolutely absurd step of banning anyone from mentioning VeChain in any thread on any topic whatsoever, to the extent of automoderating the words VEN and VeChain out of this sub for a month.  That was not just an extremely childish approach to moderating that appeared to stem from spite, but it also made a mockery of the purpose of the sub.  Given that VEN is one of the most widely held cryptos, it became impossible to engage in honest conversations about general issues, such as crypto adoption, or what people held in their wallets and why they held those coins.  The flow of information and discussion within the sub was deliberately flawed and truthful posts banned in order to make a point.

So, given the approach taken by the mod team over this issue, quite a lot of VeChain holders ended up coming to the conclusion that some of the mods had a specific problem with VEN. That was not an unreasonable conclusion given the unique measures taken.  Now, the thing that really characterizes VeChain's business model is the forging of partnerships and acquisition of clients.  They are not a general platform or a currency; they have one goal and that is to acquire customers either directly or through strategic partnerships in order to drive traffic on the network.  Such is life as a dedicated blockchain as a service provider for businesses.  In the past four or so months, VeChain have also been uniquely prolific in finding partners and acquiring real customers.  So, a change to the rules to ban partnership posts both a) feels like it is disproportionately targeted at VeChain on the basis of what its business model requires, and b) feels like it also disproportionately targets VeChain due to them being more successful than most, or possibly all, other cryptos in securing partnerships.  I'll note here that I don't actually agree and I think VeChain posts are just collateral damage here but given the behavior of the mods during the banning I can fully understand why others might think there is a spitefulness at work here.  

I also think that the limited ban on partnership posts was a solution in search of a problem.  The number of fake partnerships publicized here has been tiny, so the new requirement for the dual verification of a partnership seems entirely unnecessary and is too cumbersome to work.  As we've seen in the last few days, a crypto can announce a partnership and the post will be deleted because it is not corroborated.  Then the partnering company will corroborate via a tweet or a brief mention and a new post based on that will be removed for being low quality content, when all the meat was in the first post.  The idea that major international companies will change the way they do business and make announcements just to accommodate the wishes of the mods on a reddit sub is fanciful thinking, so the rule requirements as they stand are a huge obstacle to discussion of some of the most important things going on in the crypto space.  That issue is distinct from the specific VeChain issues mentioned above but feeds in to the feelings of some VeChain posters when they get angry about submissions being removed.  The whole procedure can feel like a Kafkan nightmare that has been designed specifically to make things hard for them and they thus end up thinking that this isn't incidental but is integral to the decisions.

"I think that to actually get the altcoins to dramatically increase in value requires another big bull run on BTC. After the next one we may even see some uncoupling where the alts can begin to rise and fall independently of BTC price. Until then, the alts are locked into the price of BTC and can only increase through pump and dumps. Put 50% into Alt of your choice and 50% into BTC to raise the market price on everything. Putting your money into alts alone won’t make a fortune.",1523386310

"He is a master con man, able to make competent people believe that he is actually more competent then them, just a bit deep and cryptic. He says vague stuff, or he uses the wrong language ... and the people that give him the benefit of the doubt start thinking about it: Maybe he means this, maybe he means that ... ah yes then it would make sense. And of course the more you belief he is Satoshi or was involved with the creation of Bitcoin the more you will think in this way. On the other side of the spectrum, why would I do an effort in to reading this con man's papers ... I have better things to do with my time! And so it's kind of an amplified DDOS attack on somebody's time.

CSW makes other people do all his thinking and debating for him, so he can keep on conning. He is a master at the craft. All so the investors in nChain keep on investing. nChain then invests all over the BCH spectrum and then of course they have to invite CSW to all these conferences.

That's why you will not hear Roger Ver say: ""He is Satoshi"" or ""He is not Satoshi"" but ""Person A still believes he is Satoshi"". It's always money. Always. I can ask Roger a thousand times to explain why he is doing business with CSW and nChain but he will never answer. The stakes are to high. Apparently in the BCH community there is use for a con man that has indeed fooled some people in to believe he is Satoshi.

Then there are the Bitcoin Core hijackers who have proven to be quite effective at manipulation themselves. They love the fact that CSW is active in the BCH community and is such a controversial figure and probably do whatever they can to make CSW look as legitimate as possible on the sub here just so they can ridicule BCH later.

The big problem for 99% of the user space is that we don't have all this knowledge so we are stuck with proxies. People that we trust that we have to believe. That's how so many of us got bamboozled by people like Greg Maxwell and others. We just could not understand all of it, and then it's easy to fool us.

CSW has to become a person non grata in our community, our he will do a lot of damage long term. Roger Ver and other business peeps need to start getting convinced that the long term financial gain from nChain is not worth the long term damage to the credibility of the project. I am sick of seeing CSW on these conferences, sometimes even getting more time to speak then real contributors. It's a slap in the face of everybody. 

/u/MemoryDealers  Are you ever going to explain to the rest of the community why doing business with him and nChain is worth it? You can't be so naive to think that CSW is Satoshi? I wish you had the balls to answer this question. I remember you talking about Albright being asked if the price of half a million dead Iraq children was worth it and Albright saying: we think it was worth it.

Are you eventually going to say to the community: I think the price of allowing CSW and nChain to buy themselves in to our community was worth it.  ???? 

If you want Bitcoin Cash to make the world a better place, you better start becoming a little bit more righteous. CSW is a con man, how can there possibly be place for him with Bitcoin Cash, cause we are not a con project, or are we? ",1523386238
"Partnerships/adoption won't matter if people continue to still not use any coin for their intended purpose. Adoption is one thing, but people actively using them is another.

I have a moral objection to taxation, but the reality is that most people don't want to break tax laws. ""Spend and replace"" is dangerous advice in the United States because every time you spend Bitcoin you incur a capital gains tax liability. Supporters of spend and replace often ignore this reality or try to convince people to just break the law. I'm all for tax resistance, but only when done willingly and cognizantly.

&gt;People using Bitcoin as a currency is good for the ecosystem.

Yes, I agree. The main problem with merchant adoption isn't high transaction fees though. It's training of staff, integration with existing systems, low rate of customer adoption gatekeeping[1], and low attention span community[2].

"It's not free to spend. It has embedded energies in the technology. Money is created by a double entry bookkeeping entry and it has a robust counterpart in currency. Bitcoin demands networks of cell phones, each of which has the same embedded energy as a small car. To make it be ubiquitous with exchanging is a massive indirect cost on this globe. It would be a reason why I, who don't have a cell phone, would need one. You also require network access, which in a  free market will only grow in price as demand for it grows. If you need to transact to live and everything is done via network you are literally signing up to be charged whatever providers want.

The average cost of bitcoin is approaching its final number. You' ll never sell the last one at the cost it would bring because no one will ever originate it. It would require an global economy's output to produce it. I'm still looking for the weighted price of a Bitcoin. I imagine I will have to find it since you are not giving it.

RCA had a monopoly in radio technology for a while, and it had a great big market share. Competitors came. The public sector could outdo Bitcoin at its offering with its own networks. Then you would have to fight the game in other PR terms because their crypto currency would not be rare. The creators of Bitcoin warned against this scenario and called it very dangerous.

Buying pressure must meet selling pressure.  The producer who sells his Bitcoin to have cashflow isn't waiting for an uptick. I am assuming the only people who would be buying are those who think there is a reason to have more stashed.

There has not been a single business cycle in Bitcoin. Where do you get this nonsense? It has behaved like a speculative mania. It has hit the wall like one too.

Your sixth point is the one that reveals who you really are. You think you are a victim of the system when you are actually a great benefactor of it. You could not survive outside of it you know.

The best place for people like this is on a deserted island where they can mull over the absolute value of social relationships that come out of the great complexity our system allows. Bitcoin offers you nothing because it has no obligation attached to it. No work of any use will come out of it. There will be those who think they can ride free on it and skirt obligation, but that is just a fool's dream. ",1523385011
"I would say the truth is within those two extremes.

LN certainly does exist, and if it is being operated on the live net even in an alpha/beta state it is not *vaporware* I think then. Not liking it or supporting it personally does not make it *vaporware*, being a hyped software that never gets released does.

However, those ""using it"" are encountering extreme problems and are discovering how fragile the system is against attack, along with other hard problems that literally require a leap for computer science itself to solve. Even the LN developers had said the current version of LN is really only for developers to try with small amounts of BTC, so anyone really trying to use it live really should not be.

Now, are there *some* people out there that would prefer it that way? Undoubedly. But that just make it more niche.

Now, there are situations where micropayments would make sense and they would open up a whole *new* market for micropayment based applications. I'm just saying Netflix isn't a great example.

&gt;I mean, isn't a wallet a prepay account of unspent transactions?

No. That's really reaching, dude.

The issue with a prepay is that it locks up your funds. Bear in mind that we're talking of LN in the context of microtransactions, not as completely replacing the existing Bitcoin ecosystem.",1523384934

Regardless of *why* it was created, the fact is that here we are today, and bitcoin is never going to be any of the things that bitcoin zealots keep getting worked up about.

Bitcoin seems to be excellent as a tool for unregulated and highly risky gambling; why anyone considers that to be a ""digital gold"" feature is unclear.   It also seems to be useful to various unsavory types and their questionable activities.   Neither of those is an especially strong selling point.

Will never happen.  The peak was in Dec 2017, driven by FOMO greed and unthinking lemmings, and one has to be really dim to keep saying or believing in ""just hodl!  it will surely rise again!"".

"u/bithereumza, I dig your opinion and props to you for voicing it.  

I for one *love it* when the BTC fanbase bash on BCH using the ‘bcash’ moniker etc.  This lets me very quickly know where these people stand, where they are coming from, what they are trying to protect (motivations) and most telling - their intellect level.  I caught on quick to this ‘attack’ and levered it to my benefit.  The louder they screamed the more I investigated, educated myself and invested.  

I will tell you this; each one of them has only hardened my stance on the fact that BCH is the answer that Bitcoin BTC once envisioned, and capable of way much more.
  
One day (hopefully soon,) Blockstream will fold and the simple-minded individuals that used censorship, astroturfing, and other tactics that basically amount to fraud will be the one’s proclaiming their love for BCH.  In my view, I hope that BTC burns to the ground and BCH rises like the phoenix from those ashes.  It is pure, technically ready and can actually be used to affect the lives of anyone and everyone around the world.  This is what excites me the most. 

I say let them have their ‘bcash’, as it provides me with a metric for transparency I need to make my decisions. ",1523384706

"&gt;call the original - ""bcore"" 

Nobody actually does this except in the context of counter-trolling the trolls who use the term bcash

&gt;or just core 

Bitcoin Core is the only relevant client on the BTC blockchain. ALL protocol and consensus decisions are made by Core developers. Development of BTC is completely centralized under Core. Thus BTC and Core are synonymous even if they choose to brand themselves as Bitcoin and refuse to acknowledge other forks. 

&gt;that they are trying to steal the brand.

Can't steal something that has no owner. 

&gt;Just by using the same ledger, they are trying to steal and convert the user base. 

Bitcoin Core is also a fork that uses the same ledger. Nobody stole users. Users are free to choose sides. It's this mentality that users and the brand are property of Core that motivates people to abandon Core. 

&gt;When whomever originally had the twitter handle only had it to disparage bitcoin as an attempt to upsell bch 

He's had the handle since 2011. It doesn't belong to Core. If he has decided that Cash is the better fork, that's his right.

&gt;it should be revoked and it should be transferred to the correct bitcoin. 

You're advocating censorship?

&gt;It's the same as when someone bought a web domain of an already existing company because they were first to profit off of it in the early days of the web but now there is a process to get the web domain to the rightful company or owner.

Again, the current owner of @bitcoin has been the owner since 2011. Nothing has been purchased. Nothing has changed ownership. What you are advocating is the forced seizure of private property.

&gt;It's the same with twitter handles of famous people that now celebrities have to get a verified tag to point out that it is who it's intended to be and not a fake attempting to masquerade with a fake name to troll or impersonate. 

This is bullshit. The account is not and never was verified. It doesn't need to be as that is a decision only the account owner can make.

"First point: The reason you have to spend bitcoin is that its free to spend. Compare to credit cards that charge 3-4% (sometimes more) per transaction. 

Second point: After 21 million, the cost of production of a bitcoin is infinite. There is no way to produce more. We have not reached that point yet, but we are in an exponential expansion towards that point that has held for over 5 years. The expansion is backed by math in the core code of bitcoin that cannot be changed by anybody. 

Third point: Bitcoin already is a monopoly in terms of the most expensive single unit of value. 

Fourth point: Selling pressure is fine. That means that merchants are accepting bitcoin, driving its network effects and helping it devour more dollars in valuation. 

Fifth point bitcoin does its boom and bust thing all the time. Its economic cycles. Normally, bubbles don't reinflate. Bitcoin has had about 10 major bubbles, each one making the bubble before it insignificant. We are 1-3 years away from the 100k price point by the long term trend. 

Sixth point I pay bills in bitcoin. I shop online with bitcoin I live in a bitcoin world. You live in a dollar world. Your money is not your own. If a bank want's to they can divest you of all money. A stock brokerage can divest you of all stock. The state can take your home. But nobody can take my bitcoin.

"&gt; If we had 1000s of independent miners then getting them all to work together towards a solution on how to quickly react to a problem would be much trickier.

Depends if their paycheck depends on them working together with the rest of the community. :)

That's the beauty of Satoshi's system.  Few things are as powerful a motivator as greed.

&gt; Your point about the Berkeley DB bug is interesting. At that point had mining already converged into several large pools?

Yes, just as bad as today if not worse.  I don't know firsthand because I wasn't deep into mining yet by that point, but based on the speed, I'm betting phone calls were ringing out all over the world waking mining pool operators from their sleep to downgrade and/or switch to a mining pool that had downgraded quickly.  I do know for a fact that, a year or three later when I was deeper into mining, all the big name miners knew eachother and had met at least once, and most of them were on friendly terms.  Not necessarily friends, but there was no animosity.

&gt; If an SM attack was going on right now, how would you know it was happening, who the selfish miner was, and how to deal with it?

I'm not a miner anymore, I shouldn't know or have to deal with it. :D

In reality, this is as simple as just collecting the orphan blocks and publishing them.  Since it is in the best interest of ~66% of the miners to do so, if they were having suspicious problems with orphan rates, I'm sure they would readily cooperate with a blockchain explorer, researcher, or even set up a system themselves to aggregate and publish orphan blocks and first-seen-on-network blocktimes, perhaps even with what peer it came from for each ""first seen.""  A detailed researcher could identify this within a week if they had a database with that information.

Once identified, /u/jessquit is correct, dealing with it is not hard.  Bitcoin mining itself is actually a lot more vulnerable to a selective block orphaning attack than anything else.  This would be the first step to a blacklist/whitelist block orphaning attack, aka a mining cartel forming, and would be very very bad.  A miner who pisses off all the other miners is in a lot more danger than they stand to gain, IMO.  Let me know if you want me to explain exactly how those would work or other ways that the selfish mining could be dealt with.

The best answer would be political because a flat out counter attack would cause resentment and lay the foundation of aggressive, manipulative shadow wars between miners.  Instead they should form a committee of major miners and include major business heads who are focused on Bitcoin for good measure.  Once selfish mining has been detected, they should try the friendly approach first: We're going to fine you our best guess of what your selfish mining cost us.  If you pay up quickly, we'll all forget this little incident and be friends again.  If you don't, we're all going to orphan your blocks until you've suffered five times those losses.  If you give a heartfelt apology and behave, we'll forget this and be friends again; if you don't, we'll shame you publicly and continue to watch you for any misbehavior and punish you accordingly.

The purpose of such a ""political cartel"" forming is to prevent something like WWII from recurring (a direct result of the harsh punishments laid on Germany from WWI) and keep everyone friendly.  Though such a political group could become dangerous in its own right later on. :/  But still the best solution to detecting a SM attack.",1523382536

"You are pointing people in the direction of using money as a commodity outside of a nation where it is standard of value (where it functions as a commodity) and doing arbitrage with it.  On the last point if you own gold and all of a sudden money grows in quantity you will take more money for it because of bid and ask, not because money imposed a price on you or a buyer. People could very well overreact thinking prices must change more than they do and overpay in the market. That's super common with people who are manipulated by gold bugs. If you did not have any gold and went to buy it you would pay what you have to. You would also resell it immediately for the same price. All the apparent gains you refer to are arbitrage related and based in money as standard of value. If a guy who buys low and sells high is stupid enough to think his thing has changed in utility then that's his own doing. The utility proposition of the commodity has clearly not changed by just money being in bigger quantity. 

Foreign exchanges are not governed by laws either. They are markets and work with bid and ask, just like gold. There will always be arbitrage gains to be made in shuffling stuff around. That is what some speculators speculate in. Investors who have large baskets of commodities for long periods usually just hold on to something in hopes that it will track the basic growth in the economy. That is the long term compounding 2-3 % you hope to make. Anyone who is here trying to promote commodities with the illusion that owning them is more than that is a charlatan wanting to capture wealth in the initial stages of a mania. There would have to be a very strong utility proposition attached to Bitcoin for it to trade at big premiums over its cost of production. What is it? How does spending Bitcoin help me make myself richer and why the fuck should I pay anyone who originated one for a few bucks and is hoarding it many thousands of dollars for it? Rarity is not utility, nor is it equivalent of value. What basic thing am I paying for that will return me so much more than what it cost to produce on average. I understand if you will not sell it to me for what it costs to make it, but that may even be too much for the added utility it offers me. Only if ones makes all sorts of arguments about how it can help avoid taxes, or give anonymity and such, I do see added utility, but you will never sustain that libertarian dream with Bitcoin. The beautiful complexity we have in place with government and laws will not be undermined with commodities that offer a chance for people to weasel out. I have enough faith that we are governed by laws to see that be protected.

The theory you believe in is the one of the bigger fool. Bitcoin is not a monopoly in money token. It will never be a monopoly. It will be out there in a landscape of many offerings and it will struggle to carve out a place among other things that have better properties. Just like a radio is useful and can be traded for other commodities, Bitcoin will fall to the cost of its average unit production unless it delivers great utility in some fashion that only it can do.There's a very good reason why macro economists see its long term value as zero and why speculators talk it up to levels where even $50 dollar investors might see riches in this. Your numbers are based in offering a get rich scheme to the fools that will be milked for dreaming big. 

By definition, the use of Bitcoin will mean that it will face selling pressures because not everyone will hoard it. Those who will collect it will want to sell it to meet their obligations and that will mean that new buyers would have to show up paying ever more for it. What is hoped for is that no one will ever notice they are paying a holder of something a huge premium for what he has stashed. Good luck with that.

Requirements include, amongst many, many others: _Having a contract, which must cover specific edge cases, with all data processors and data controllers_, and _deleting personal data upon request, when you no longer need to process it._ Both of which are hard on anonymous append-only blockchains.

Assuming a pragmatic reading of the law: _Running blockchain nodes for Ethereum, and all likewise distributed application/data storage systems will be a violation of the GDPR. Even if private individuals do so._

Assuming a by-the-letter reading of the law: _Running any blockchain node, including just cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, will be a violation of the GDPR._

The main problem being that pretty much every blockchain project has taken a ""LALALALA I CAN'T HEAR YOU THIS IS FINE"" approach to dealing with the problem, completely ignoring the GDPR. This will result in a _LOT_ of projects eating shit because they didn't prepare.",1523381142

"Who writes such articles? There are a lot of nonsense with a zero level of fact checking.
The truth is that all crypto trades in Poland know that they need to pay taxes, and this is not new that need to pay 18% or 32% from GAINS.


The whole affair concerns on paying another tax which name is PCC. PCC is tax from EVERY TRADE and people need to pay 1% value of every trade. This is killing for traders who do a lot of trades. Such a tax can significantly exceed capital (not to be confused with profits). 
This is not a new law but an interpretation of the law and it works backwards. It means that people have to pay for everything back from the beggining not only in 2017.
For example you have 15000 PLN in cryptocurreency (~4400$). This person doins 50 buing trades and 50 selling trades every day for the whole month. This person is day trader and earns small money for changing exchange rates.
After month this person need to pay HALF MILION PLN. Yes, 500 000 PLN (~145000 $).
And this is not tax from gains. If this person after paying PCC have any gains (if this is even possible) needs to pay 18% or 32% trax from gains. 


And this is not over. After every trade people need to fill three pages of the document not later than 14 days after trade and take it to the tax office.
This person from the example need to fill 9000 pages of documents (3000 trades x 30 days) after ONE month of trades.


Think about people who was trading for few years. Now they need to pay milions of PLN and fill many thousand os documents. But this is not over some people exceeded 14 days now they need to fill a special document in which they plead guilty and pay a penalty for delay.

Originally, I believed bitcoin would reach a value where it would be stable once it got big enough. My dream died with blockstream. Then I though, maybe bitcoin cash could do it, but it's still got a long way to go.

"Just some basic advice:

- Don't believe anything you read about crypto without trying to personally verify it from an independent source--this goes double for advice received on Reddit.

- Don't day-trade. It's possible to make money day-trading, but to do so, you'd either have to be extremely lucky, or a genius financial analyst who spends all of their time on crypto. And, if you're the latter, why aren't you already working on Wall Street?

- Don't trade on margin unless you're an expert (see point two). Margin-trading essentially means that someone is loaning you money to trade with--usually for the purposes of betting that the price of a coin will go down. However, any exchange that loans you money also reserves the right to liquidate your position and force you to take a loss under circumstances you can't control. There's also been some evidence recently that exchanges with high amounts of margin-trading have been intentionally causing momentary price spikes in order to force the automatic liquidation of short positions. In the stock market, this sort of manipulation would be illegal. 

- Coinbase is the easiest way to trade fiat (i.e., dollars) for cryptocurrency, but they charge a major premium over the current price to do so. Last time I checked, for example, they wanted $50 over the going price for ETH and $10 over the going price for LTC. 

- Before investing in a cryptocurrency, ask yourself: What problem is this solving? Is a blockchain (or smart contract, etc.) the best or easiest way to solve this problem? If not, then it's probably a bad investment. 

- Be careful of ICOs. Many are essentially unregulated stock offerings. Some are outright scams.

"A proper informative answer to this would take a 500 page manual.

Here's a short attempt at giving you some info to base your decision on. It's biased. Hopefully it might be of use to others too.

**1. Introduction**

**1.a. Propaganda**:
Anything (comment, meme, media) that aims to damage your image/credibility/attractiveness of your communication channels. 

The aim always is to silence you with an added benefits: it encourages other public figures to keep their mouths shut. There is also a ""Psyop"" component we've detected and that seems to have increased in importance recently. They wear you down with high frequency provocations to achieve one of two outcomes: you withdraw from the public arena or you become tired and hypersensitive and lose the means to communicate effectively.

**1.b. Actors**:
Joe Bloggs down the road who is new to crypto does not jump into harassing someone he doesn't know. Period. A handful of immature teens might join in a harassment campaign but who cares. There are virtually no ""civilians"" here. Some might have participated when BTC was in a bull, attacking you to foolishly ""protect their investment"". In the 4 months old bear a lot of the speculative mania and irrational behavior has disappeared and we don't see them anymore. We've spent thousands of hours looking at these guys and our conviction is that none are ""real"", genuine individuals. Not one. 

**1.c. Identification (who to block)**:
A first step is to ask if you need to make a difference between :

- an account programmed to publish propaganda
- an account programmed to increase propaganda exposure (likers and retweeters of propaganda tweets and comment)
- an account manned once a month/week/day to manually spread and /or assist propaganda
- an account manned nearly all day to organize, spread and/or assist propaganda (ArminvanBitcoin for example)
- an individual personally engaged in spreading and/or assisting propaganda (AlistairMilne for example or lesser known ones)

Knowing that propaganda is propaganda, no matter its source, and that assisting propaganda exposure is propaganda, our view is that they are all equally and intentionally damaging to you and should be checked aka blocked.

We have decided to block the lot, including every Blockstream or Lightning Labs execs and shareholders, if only to make their information gathering harder. We keep ""Cobra"" as a kind of ""pet"" because it's fun and he is ""playing"" the BCH community; we are curious and it's educative (the guy's a pro at this).

The business way to look at this is this: every single individual and account that participates in this is costing BCH holders, investors and entrepreneurs money. And way more to you than the rest; the reputational damage in terms of lost opportunities must amount to millions (people are much more reluctant to associate with you than they would be otherwise).

**2. How to select the accounts to block**

**2.a. Targeting comments**:

This is the second most expensive option, not advised except on an ad-hoc basis when spotting accounts that have gone through other filters.

Examples:

- vomiting and similar media gifs (repulsive)
- abuse/intimidation (repulsive makes you look weak)
- ""Give it up bro"" comment, as if talking to a child: makes you look unreasonable, won't listen to reason
- ""Roger Ver is not very popular"" comment: that's the *'narrative speller'* that tells readers how they should interpret all the other comments
- ""I like Bitcoin Cash but don't do x, y, z"": the voice of reason keen to make compromises and therefore much more credible in its criticism of you
- ""If only you stopped doing x"" voice of reason again, asking for very little but you won't stop acting like an ureasonnable extremist.
- ""Hahaahahahahaa"", ""Lol"", ""xD"" comment, repulsive and damaging to your image:  either your followers are nutters (so you must be too) or what you wrote must be stupid nonsense.
- The ""War and peace"" comment (max chars, unlike most others) that gives the illusion of providing a reasoned expert argument and yet when dissected it says ""Call BCH BCash"". We usually find these accounts posting vomiting gifs a month later.
- Random unrelated comments. They give a feeling of discomfort to readers who need to make efforts to interpret the comments only to discover it's completely random. It has a repulsive effect.
- Many more but that keep repeating, this is not meant to be extensive. 

The patterns become very clear after a while. We've spent ages looking at your twitter, it's like a Petri Dish of Blockstream propaganda. Best source of study :D

What is most important is to look at the comments in their totality. Individually they are harmless. *But as a package they are exceedingly potent.* 

They rely on group psychology. To summarize, put ten people in a room and show them a drawing of a circle. If 9 of them loudly claim they see a square, the tenth will SEE (not just say) a square and will defend that position tooth and nail if challenged. This example is fictional but similar experiments have been made by the thousand and many are nearly as extreme as this.

Each of your tweets is like a roomful of people. Genuine people read your tweets (""enter the room"") and see reams and reams of garbage that mocks, abuses, ridicules and derides you. Guess what that does to readers... this is why you have such large volumes of spam, purely to trigger that effect in readers. The Blockstream/Lightning gang wouldn't bother otherwise.

"&gt;The purpose of the attack is to monopolize mining.  Short term loss, long term profit. I don’t really know how else I can explain it, it’s a pretty basic concept. 

Sorry I fail to see any benefits from this strategy, it simply too costly (attacker end up wasting magnitudes more hash power than his target) there is no way one can benefit from this situation, whatever it is short or long term.

&gt;Perhaps I should have been more clear, the pool is the miner in this example.  Pooled mining is not a requirement of the protocol, it’s just a way for individuals to smooth out rewards variance. Also, you can’t just blacklist a miner, it’s pretty easy to initially relay your blocks all over the place in the network, you also don’t have to identify yourself.  The pools putting tags in the coinbase is just a nicety, not a requirement of the protocol.

Miner can be identified by payout address or if it come from a pool.

Also rather easy to hide as you say so a “white list” might be more effective.

If none of those are possible, miner can decide to give up mining header first to not waste hash power. (mine empty block while verifying like they do now for example)

That is, if such attack is a real threat which I doubt.

Miner will have to decide for themselves if mining header is a profitable strategy and worth the risk. I am fine with that.

&gt;So far as fees go, you do not pay a fee to publish a block to the network.  

No, but you pay a fee to get your payout onchain if you use a pool. (And two times...)

Small miners use pools obviously.

&gt;Also, you realize that there’s a ceiling to how many tiny miners can get regular payments via a pool, right?  For simplicity, call each miner’s output in a batched transaction 150 bytes.  At a 32MB block size that’s only 31 million individual small miners getting paid daily and the network is entirely saturated just with paying the pool participants. 

Not sure what that has to do with my point but that’s correct.

It is very healthy for the network that small independent miner remain profitable. (The more profitability change with scale the more mining will centralised.. high fees change profitability with scale.. in a massive way)

&gt;Larger blocks present risks to decentralization, and must be balanced.

Do you at least see that small block can cause a risk for decentralisation too?

The precise example I give (high fee kill the little guy) is somehow always dismissed by small blocker.

Which make me think the small block motive is not decentralisation otherwise this argument would be taken seriously.

&gt;I support larger blocks(and SegWit is doing that now, albeit not quite as much as I’d ideally like to see), but I’m not willing to risk the value proposition of the network to achieve it. Hence, we must tread carefully and support other scaling solutions besides just increasing the base block size.

I understand your position as many small blockers seem to think there is zero risk with keeping small blocks so it make sense to make zero compromise on block size.

I do not share this view, I think it is very naive and I think there is immense risk to the small block (re)design of Bitcoin (in its BTC form).

"The number of growing dollars makes the dollar weaker. And when the dollar is weaker, people like me who use dollars suddenly have to pay 80 dollars for groceries each week instead of 50 dollars. Also, until congress bumps up the minimum wage, minimum wage workers are in effect taking a pay cut. 

Then we also have the fun side effect of interest rates going up, and the real world buying power of wages going down everywhere. Add to that the fact that businesses increase prices to compensate, and inflation is a huge motherfucking problem. It hurts people, contributes to poverty, and causes children to go hungry because their parents can't afford to feed them because the government made their wages worth less.

Also, saving is a thing. When people spend their money as fast as possible they don't save. The difference between saving and not saving is the difference between a house downpayment and renting for life. That is keynesian economics, and it is evil. 

The value of the dollar DOES go down. You can track its decline by measuring its buying power. Or you can measure it against a basket of other fiat currencies: http://www.macrotrends.net/1329/us-dollar-index-historical-chart Also, see https://inflationdata.com/Inflation/Inflation_Rate/Long_Term_Inflation.asp. If the price of gold, silver, groceries, commodities, and houses and cars is going up, that means the dollar is going DOWN. 

Also seigniorage (the ability to issue tender) is not a crime. Governments and society define crime and they haven't called it so. However, mass printing of money will continue to drive the buying power of the dollar down. The civilians will be screwed and the money will be wasted in pointless wars in the middle east. Also, macro economists who say it has no value are deluded, or simply not informed. Bitcoin is a very good yardstick to measure goods and services in transnational deals. It also perfectly solves counterparty risk. Normally, escrow services are used for counterparty risk elimination. Bitcoin solves it all. 

Also, when it comes to value of exchanges, I have been trading stocks and cryptocurrencies. I know exactly how the free market works, and I can tell you right now that you do not understand what a currency that can be divided down into smaller values than the zimbabwe dollar, but with individual units worth 7,000 us dollars means. That in and of itself is the most accurate yardstick in the entire world. There will come a day when bitcoin will eat at minimum 10-20% of the value of the gold market. And it has already been chomping down on failed state currencies and places where no banks exist like africa and south america. Chomp. Chomp. Chomp. 

Bitcoin is the perfect monetary solution, and it is a testament to the strength of our existing monetary systems that bitcoin hasn't devoured them whole as of yet.

ELA (Elastos) - Newest platform supported by NEO. Low market cap for what they are trying to bring to the table, ICO Platform and an operating system built off of blockchain. Also, holders of ELA will be airdropped all ICO tokens launched on Elastos which is pretty cool
GAS - The utility coin for NEO. Just undervalued right now. There are 1/6th the amount of GAS as there are NEO yet the price is less than 1/3 the price of NEO. This is no brainer big future gainer for me
VRM - The digital reserve, Proof of Work/ Asic Resistant coin tied to the Vericoin Ecosystem. A stupid low market cap of 3 Million for a project that could solve the scalability debate of Bitcoin. Definitely worth a flyer. 
NEO - Gotta hold some NEO if you hold GAS
VRC - The proof of stake component to the VRC and VRM dynamic binary blockchain. With a 13 Million market cap plenty of room to run, but I Like VRM more. Still if you hold VRM, you gotta hold some VRC

That was fake, ""Wraith protocol"" does not exist, it was just a hypeword for optional stealth adresses from 2014. Something that any coin can use. It's a wallet level feature, not protocol level. They are also worthless for privacy, especially if they are optional.
""So the only difference with stealth addresses is essentially to move the chore of producing a unique address from the server to the client. Indeed, in some ways stealth addresses may be worse, since very few people use them, and if you are known to be one of them, it will be easier to connect stealth transactions with you.

It doesn't provide ""100% anonymity"". The fundamental anonymity weakness of Bitcoin remains - that everyone can follow the chain of payments, and if you know something about one transaction or the parties to it, you can deduce something about where those coins came from or where they went.""

"&gt; &gt; You talk like honest miners who have discovered a selfish miner will continue to give that miner priority in the full graph. What if they have a round table
&gt; 
&gt; Good thing mining is centralized enough that responding reactively rather than proactively is a possibility.

What's wrong with what /u/jessquit said here?

Bitcoin exists to serve humans.  What does it matter if it isn't a perfect machine that can continue running long after all human beings vanish from the planet?

I still remember really early on in Bitcoin when there was an accidental hardfork caused by the berkley DB bug.  The miners around the world got woken up out of their beds and scrambled to downgrade their mining software.  They did it astonishingly fast, and I was proud of how effective the system works.

Bitcoin is designed to work with human nature by pitting them against eachother.  It doesn't ignore humans, it uses them.  The only winner is the system, and therefore all the users - but the miners win little victories along the way and think they are winning.

&gt; How would miners have even the slightest inkling what was going on if people like Emin and Ittay had never discovered and publicized selfish mining?

Miners aren't stupid.  When your orphan rate is high, it becomes at least one person's full-time job to determine why and fix it.  If not multiple people's full time job.  Plus the miners generally meet eachother and conferences, and most of them are on friendly terms.  This isn't a MMA bout, they don't compete directly, only indirectly.  And they all learn a lot from eachother.",1523378318
"Only a matter of time before this is extended to all banks - banking is effectively a cartel after all.

Particularly concerning that debit card transactions are blocked - credit card transactions are in some way understandable (but still a bullshit reason as most banks allow gambling / casino transactions on credit cards).

To be fair, this is what crypto was designed to overcome - the banks becoming a law onto themselves in giving themselves authority as to who, when and for what reason people can transfer their money to others, as well as how much commission they should take. Combine this with the continuous push by governments and banks for a ""cashless society"" (i.e. a society where every financial transaction has to pass through a bank and/or government for audit and approval) and you can start to see why people will turn to crypto as a solution.

In fact, if they got desperate, I could see them passing regulation that requires ISPs prohibit network traffic that appears to be ""use of '*criminal*' internet currencies"" or somesuch verbiage which they'll figure out how to make sure bitcoin qualifies as.

"The number of dollars growing hurts nothing. That is all manageable  with money flow.

The interest rate is never made up instantaneously and there is no need for it to be made up. It will be covered by expansion or it will dealt with by default. As long as the system grows faster than its defaults that is fine. If the condition of default grows too big (as in 2008) the system is recapitalized by money originating. A very good feature of such a system is that you have no incentive to just hold on to your money for a very long time. Over many years it starts to lose its value. That's an incentive for flow, which is what you want.

The value of the dollar does not go down, because it is standard of value. It continues to meet one dollar of obligation. What changes is the market price of things to reflect the abundance of money in the private sector. The quantity of money imposes nothing on the quantity of goods. The abundance of money is in no way a bad thing. The quality of the standard of value remains the same. 

Obligation as the underlying nature of money has been in place since the days of the first money in Sumer. In exchange for your contribution to that early civilization you were given arable land, tools to work it and access to all sorts of benefits. The deal was written in clay and it was enforced on the threshing floor. When you become a citizen today you enter into obligation too. For access to the money system you are imposed some money obligations (taxes). Its a great deal. If you don't like it you can come to lose your rights of membership.

If you have more money and you are asked to meet more dollars worth of obligation nothing has changed. That is something you don't seem to understand. You cannot say that it is a crime to have more money because it lowers its value. It doesn't. The market will decide what your gold is worth based in dollars. Everything will reprice to reflect the current state. Money has stayed the same. It's only basic use was to meet government obligation. Your desire to trade it for commodities is a use that is available to you because of the universal need for it. Having Gold be worth x amount of dollars is not a goal onto itself. Who cares what gold is worth? It doesn't meet obligations for a citizen. The thing that does is in bigger supply and the obligation will track it perfectly. 

Bitcoin has terrible properties, the very ones we moved away from with gold and silver as standards of value years ago. It is why a group of macro economists came out the other day and said that it has no long term value, zero=zilch. I won't talk in terms of long term because we have to live in the now. It has very limited utility value right now and a lot narratives overstating its utility that are meant to deceive people into pouring their money into so that games of arbitrage can go on and land some valuable money in people's hands.

You have little knowledge for what standard of value is in exchanges. I suggest you read about it. There are very objective relationships between commodities, exchanges values and standard of value within capitalism. You are trying to confuse people by saying things like the standard of value is going down in value compared to gold as if you could remove the relationship that exists between the two. It is not because gold is better that it goes up in price it is because the market can extract more for it. You are free to not pay that higher price. A higher price is not imposed on anything in any way that market does not produce. Money does its thing and you will decide what to do with it. It will continue to pay your membership fee, though. BTW, if you find your obligations are too high it's because a lot of money goes without obligation these days. We have a political problem of redistribution that makes it look like its not working when really nothing has changed in its objective workings.",1523377329

"&gt; It has a governance model which is currently partially centralized, but planned to be further decentralized. For various reason including speed, but that doesn't mean that it's centralized.

Their plan for becoming decentralized is described here:

https://medium.com/proof-of-working/decentralization-from-coopetition-b10d7ce3b9d

But it doesn't describe a decentralized platform:

&gt;In line with these ideas, NEO will begin its decentralization **by allowing well known commercial projects and communities to run consensus nodes**, forming an initial confederation of actors with a strong interest in guaranteeing the security and success of the network

and

&gt;All nominees for **consensus nodes will go through a rigorous identification process before being voted in on MainNet**. This process includes providing identification that can **hold the owners of the consensus node host legally liable**

This describes a ledger that is totally controlled by NEO and totally permissioned, given the plan states that the NEO Council will have to approve every candidate as a legal entity and known, before being allowed to be voted in as a consensus node.

The furthest you could go is calling it federated. It is more comparable to a corporate joint venture than a peer-to-peer network and decentralized ledger.

And to put all of this into context: the Federal Reserve System consists of 12 regional Federal Reserve banks, each of which has six out of nine of its board of directors elected by the respective region's member banks.

According to the article's ridiculous arguments, the Federal Reserve System decentralized.

Ripple is acting like it's just a crypto company going after a remittance market while it's actually establishing a global internetwork of real-world finance.

"Things arent as bad as you might think...

The banks arent necessarily against crypto per say, theyre against the massive headaches created by customers using credit to fund their crypto accounts and this is a measure to push for regulation. 
Look at it from their perspective - thousands of their customers put their money into the market at an all time high, and then the market crashed 75% in many cases.. some worse. Many of these people racked up their credit cards at 20ish% interest because a friend told them they couldnt lose... 
The banks had to take action now, rather than a year from now when its many times the ammount of $ where real damage could be done.. and in my opinion as soon as its in place we will begin to see growth in this market beyond what most think. 2-3trillion m.cap is just the beginning...
Im in now way on their side, and its our money to do with what we like but its actually a good thing because whats needed is just enough regulation and education to ensure the crypto market can grow and establish itself for years to come.

Cryptocurrency is in the growing pains stage right now, but there are a lot of good people working to legitimize it and in the very near future onboarding fiat will be easy, as will withdrawing into fiat.

The crypto world was and still is top heavy with inexperienced weak hands. So the moment they hear any thing negative they panic sell.   
Since there is no economic foundation holding coins up that high, only hype so it free falls.   
The only reason coins are at the current levels is because manipulative whales who were going to dump the coins did not get a chance, the prices dropped too fast for even them, they underestimated just how many weak hands were in the market.   
Whales are currently trying to create new hype, claiming we reached the bottom or that new money is coming in, or some big players are coming with institutional funds... blah blah blah... its not true, they are trying to hype it just enough for them to dump their lot.   
Just look at the charts, the movements of coins in unison in all exchanges is the same, those movements are no organic.  They are mini pump and dumps.    
Cryptos are going to drop some more, some coins will never recover it is obvious.   
Just like religious people everyone thinks that it is they who are going up to heaven, everyone else is going to hell.   
 Of course this is not the end of Cryptos it is just a change of sentiment and attitude.   
Now ""new investors"" are going to scrutinize ""why"" , so the up trend will be slow and gradual, again majority of existing coins are doomed.

"In the paper, he proves a theorem I'm not a mathematician and I struggle to follow the actual passages. If you are a mathematician please share with us what you see. In the end of the passages, he states:

&gt;The results obtained are demonstrated in a rigorous way using mathematical methods. Therefore, we have proven that:
• No strategy by a selfish miner can be successful on average.
• At best, any gains are lower than those that could be obtained without the selfish strategy

The conclusion of the entire paper goes as follows:

In this paper, we demonstrated that the strategy is flawed and this form of reasoning is detrimental to the bitcoin protocol. This is because it can seriously degrade the system security if users can arbitrarily tinker with the existing controls when they do not understand the nature of the system they seek to alter. Bitcoin has been approximated to a Poisson process. Nonetheless, even in the ideal case without difficult changes or a hash rate growth, it is better represented using a negative binomial or Erlang distribution. Reacting to the distribution of a block makes the distribution conditional. The selfish miner acts after the honest miner; thus, it is no longer an i.i.d. Poisson process.

Bitcoin mining with a constant hash rate is a zero-sum game. Without increasing the hash rate, miners cannot earn more than the default honest strategy. At best, they can cause all parties to lose revenue. Revenue is not profit; however, even in this instance, **we demonstrated that the overall rates of revenue are lowered** and therefore no rational, profit-seeking miner would engage in such a strategy. The rational economic actor will consider not only their instantaneous revenue turnover and the associated profitability of an individual transaction or block reward, but also the overall system profitability. 

When reviewing the cost of attacking the network, a rational actor needs to consider both the cost invested in the network as well as the expected additional returns.",1523374989
"&gt; I just stay well away from that conflict because of how toxic it tends to get.

Same here. Personally the way I see it is that the next bullrun will reveal what works and what doesn't, since their main claim is that we have low tx fees in BTC, because volume is low. 


Wait and see. If either or wins, it almost doesn't matter. Since I did side with one of them, I do hope to be right in the end. But do I know for sure that Segwit with 30-35% adoption can keep transactions low in the next bullrun? No. I hope it does. If it doesn't at first, maybe it pushes adoption higher.

"My theory is when the uptrend went absolutely insane (you can see clearly where the huge volume kicked in) is that they (the uber rich) loaded up with the sole intention of having enough BTC to be able to cause a market crash when they dumped it.

Then with BTC at its recent lows, they slowly add more and more, to where they have more BTC than ever before. probably doing most of the accumulation on the OTC market where we can't see the volumes. 

When they're done accumulating they'll light a match and spark up another big run. Then, after making a killing on the up side, they'll take shorts against the FOMO and dump their BTC again. Rinse and repeat. 

If you believe these big players aren't working together, I think you are mistaken... ""When 2 tigers fight, one is dead and the other is wounded"".

"&gt; I think the biggest issue right now is how divided the community is over their ""team's"" coin. We are in subs calling other coins scams (which many are) 

That's not an issue, that's a necessity. The community has a crucial role in weeding out the crap.   

&gt; I'm just afraid by the time everyone realizes it, business will be conducted on private chains or conglomerates like Hyperledger and public crypto will fall by the sidelines with a few useful dapps here and there.  

Private chains are just databases. They already exist. They have one giant limitation in that no private database trusts another private database.   
To use a blockchain for a private database is missing the point. A blockchain allows multiple different actors to organise themselves without having to trust each other to play fair.   
For this to happen, different parties need to hold a stake in keeping the network secure.  This is why you can't separate the blockchain from the currency without losing it's biggest value. The currency is not just for money transfers, the currency is what guarantees that everyone will be playing fair regardless of what other functions are build upon it.  ",1523374213
"&gt;One of the chains is referred to as Bitcoin by the overwhelming majority of the ecosystem. Another one of these is referred to as Bitcoin Cash by the overwhelming majority of the ecosystem.

By your logic, anyone owning any internet accounts called 'Bitcoin' and supporting large-block-Bitcoin, have to give up their account, because the majority currently support 1-MB-Bitcoin.

That would prevent any movement to hard fork away from the Bitcoin Core leadership impossible, because at the outset of every movement, it is always only supported by a minority.

While I don't think Samson did well at that debate, he was clearly laughing at how Ver could blame the world's issues on Bitcoin core developers and blockstream.

Roger used an appeal to emotion in substitution of a strong argument, a manipulative tactic used by debaters and politicians, like something Trump would do. Those of us who were watching and saw what he did, all shook our heads with Samson in unison.

Thanks to Lightning Network, people are able to send each other BTC in nanocent denominations with zero fees.

Pan-African BTC transactions are already happening with incredibly low fees through LN. https://twitter.com/takinbo/status/978289678901301250

Technology doesn't save babies by itself - PEOPLE save babies.

Perfect example - Bill Gates made obscene amounts of money and when he retired he started working on global poverty, children's health etc.

In the last 10 years he has used the Gates Foundation money that Warren Buffet donated to save over 100 million children's lives.

http://amp.timeinc.net/fortune/2017/02/14/data-sheet-gates-foundation

So BCH fans, let's flip this logic. Why don't you ask your beloved Roger why he doesnt take the majority of his wealth (that he got with a lot of luck by being in the right place and the right time) and use it to save babies if he's so concerned about babies dying?

Blockchains don't scale for the entire globe's transactions while retaining the decentralization that has always been a core tenet of Satoshi's Vision... second layers and sidechains do scale while retaining decentralization.

Bitcoin (BTC) WILL still be the money of the internet, it will be peer to peer cash. (That name Peer to Peer Cash was a nod to evil blockstream globalist babykiller Adam Back's Hashcash...he was referenced in the whitepaper).

[Bitcoin (and BCH) is currently peer to everyone ... peer to network ... It's not even peer to peer. LN makes it actually peer to peer...So if you are getting hung up on the title of the whitepaper, why don't you start with that since it's the first thing BCH and BTC are not.]

I could easily flip that baby killing argument and say Roger Ver is responsible for the deaths of babies by delaying hyperbitcoinization! Roger is working AGAINST Bitcoin being a global reserve currency. 

By delaying segwit and LN for 2 years, and doing so much damage to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in 2017 and 2018 and beyond with his BCH psyops confusion campaign, he is directly responsible for the tax burden of everyone who was airdropped BCH against their will, and delaying Bitcoin becoming a global reserve  currency, which is contributing to more war, more death and more dead babies.

And what about the Chinese government - how many deaths are they responsible for? How much censorship do they do? Yet Jihan is one of the co-founders of BCH with alleged backing from the Chinese government. He speaks out against Reddit censorship, but doesn't make a peep about Chinese government censorship when asked.

"Here is the problem with your obligation theory. The number of dollars (and dollar obligations) inflates. 

Secondly, the fed charges interest to banks. But, where do banks get enough money to pay the entire sum back+ interest? They can't, because the people can't. And then what happens when obligations are not met? 

Every single day, there is quite a few bankruptcies somewhere in the united states. Where do those obligations go? 

And finally, let's put the nail in the coffin. If the dollar were subject to your theory of the dollar holding real value beyond the market:
If this were true, it would be immune to the market forces of supply and demand. Supply and demand govern commodities. And yet, when the federal reserve prints dollars, the value of the dollar goes down. It is called inflation. The value of the dollar is a hallucination, and it is especially bad because many of the worlds dollars are not on the market right now. If the dollar had no value, people would not work for them. Soldiers would not work for them. Police would not work for them.

Now, lets compare the dollar to the value of bitcoin. Bitcoin has a set number of units. It is not subject to the whims of fed chairman. It will last long after the dollar has ceased and the american empire has collapsed. As such, bitcoin far outperforms the dollar on the free market.

It is a psychological manipulation tool more than anything else. A human mind wants and even requires reasons for the things that happen. People will create reasons for all sorts of things that are not readily explained. This is the reason for superstition. TA allows those with money to create a more predictable market for themselves by giving a reason to the peasants for the goings on in a market. It is a way to restrict profitability for the masses and passing it on to the few. Bringing order to chaos. As long as those with money can convince those without that TA has application and value as it provides an explanation in the crypto market, it will have that value. Not because there is some mystical science to it but because traders will alter the way they trade to follow TA. You sell because the numbers indicated you should sell and you buy because the numbers indicated you should buy. Without TA imposing the psychological restriction on traders everyone would trade by emotion and as a result create an irrational market and make more money than those who wish to control and manipulate the market would like.

"I just posted this in [another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8b4vag/great_read_about_holding_bitcoin_or_alts_when_a/), but I thought it might be of interest to the people here:

According to CoinMarketCap, during the earlier bull market, total crypto market capitalization peaked on November 30, 2013, at ~$15.2 billion. Thereafter, a long bear market began, during which total market cap bobbed up and down for over a year, before finally bottoming out at ~$3.6 billion on January 16, 2015--a ~94% drop.

This year, total crypto market cap hit an all-time high of ~$828 billion on January 7, 2018. If the current bear market were to exactly mirror the 2013-2015 bear market (and it won't, but this is still a good jumping-off point), then we would expect to see the market hit a low of ~$196 billion by mid-February 2019.

As I write this, we're currently at ~$260 billion (i.e., down ~68.5% from ATH), having hit a low of ~$248 billion in the past few weeks (i.e., down ~70% from ATH). This suggests that we may still have a significant distance to go--both in terms of time and market cap lost--before we see the bottom of the current market.

I'm a software engineer in R&amp;D so this is perfectly acceptable as long as you show a kickass chart in Tableau to the corporate douches.

All my ideas of how to use blockchain for my everyday corporation needs were solved and it didn't cost me money just to send a transaction. So I started developing a blockchain in composer to see if I could spin this thing up. I integrated the blockchain with AWS and using django with dockers and micro services as my gateways. I launched a permissioned blockchain with my preference on the protocol albeit POS, POW, POeT, etc. I wrote up a quick white paper, since I had plenty of practice reading them, and presented it to a couple C-levels. They were sold...

"I'm not saying it's wise or unwise.  Thats a completely separate issue.

What I was saying is that Bitcoin has problems IMHO, but not for the reasons that the article gave.

The ability for governments to steal from people isn't a good reason to remain with fiat currency (which is basically the argument that the article gave).  However, a good reason for fiat is that via FRB value added to the system can be accurately tracked.

Because Bitcoin is a closed system loans on a massive scale like what we have with the banking system cannot be done (or at least, I dont see a way for it to be done on a massive scale).

If I am a lender, and I lend a million people 1 bitcoin each, expecting 1.05 bitcoin in return in 10 years, where does that 1million * 0.05 bitcoin come from?

With fiat currency, because fiat is a fantasy, it's magically created from nowhere to track people's added labour into the system.  With bitcoin this 'magically created' can't happen, and thus a persons added labour cannot be tracked.

Bitcoin is better than gold, in that it's much more efficient (protecting your bitcoin is much cheaper than protecting your gold... with gold you have to buy a safe, hire a guy with a gun, etc; similarly transporting your bitcoin for sale doesn't require hiring a heavy duty truck, etc ,etc), but it has the same problems as gold in that more of it cannot be created than a fixed amount.

With all due respect, Radeon is way more efficient than NVIDIA it seems, at least that's the case for Monero. 

So in theory Radeon is also the only proper producer for GPU mining. 



You assiociate it less with decentralization, because everybody has a GPU in their computer. The thing is, most GPUs are not profitable and if you want to mine, you better get something high-end'ish and google the efficiency rates of the different cars/different coins. 



NVIDIA is hardly useable for Monero, because of low H/s, and then you have to ask yourself which gaming people, also mine? 


And which miners that buy a Radeon, also use it for gaming? 


See where I'm going? You're more cautious of Bitmain, because they're a monopoly and AMD isn't. But AMD/NVIDIA are also the only two big players in GPU ecospehere. Another thing is of course you know that Bitmain controls some pools and uses some miners for themselves, that's what you're scared off, compared to GPUs. 



But anyone can purchase 1000 cards and destroy a shitcoin, if they wanted to, you know? Actually these ""shits and giggles 51% attacks"" on shitcoins are not a rare thing at all. 

&gt;  Tech wise it is a bit unimpressive



I honestly have somewhat of a problem with this mindset. By this definition Bitcoin is also unimpressive. 

Why does it have to be impressive anyways? It has to work, that's the key part. Cardano, which I bought aswell and invested in, they may be great in the future, but right now they're really nothing special. They're also not decentralized, pretty much a company working on a product, similar to how ETH started out and now tries to move away from that - to become decentralized. 

Why does it have to be flashy all the time? Bitcoin works. Transaction fees, we will find out how Segwit can handle high volume times, in the next bullrun. 


We will also see what impact LN is going to have. The tech is definitely not unimpressive, it just so happens that they're a currency, more than some kind of ... let's say they don't offer additional utility, like ETH, NEO, NEM, ADA, IOTA does. 



I honestly Bitcoin is highly underrated. Goes back to our original discussion. Most Alts/Shits are *not* decentralized, which is the *main innovation* behind crypto to begin with. 


The main innovation is not smart contracts, nor is it low transaction fees. It's decentralization and money working free and being unkillable. That's the innovation and I honestly think the vast majority of people here in rcrypto forgot that. 



To clarify, I am invested in ADA. I also believe in their work and I think they can do something great. I also have no hate for other projects like ETH or IOTA, honestly. But give credit where it's due. Bitcoin *is* decentralized, much more than these coins are. 


&gt; I'm glad to have been a factor in changing your mind on VTC


You defintitely were. I would have never bothered looking at a shitcoin like this, without this discussion. But could you name another one? I really like I'm what I'm reading so far about Vertcoin to be honest. 


&gt; Thx for an interesting perspective &amp; discussion!


Originally wanted to just say agree and move on. But that unimpressive line really struck me, sorry if it came off rude. 


Just because other Alts claim to do next level shit, left and right, proven theory is almost none of that. Bitcoin is stable and works. It's boring, because it doesn't change as quickly. 


But it cannot change as quickly. That is why a *soft-fork* took ages to implement, because consensus couldn't agree. That's a good thing. It means nobody can randomly fuck over Bitcoin and apply changes out of thin air. If updates are pushed through, it means it's almost guaranteed to be a success for the overall platform. Also Bitcoin is already running. 


ETH has that problem right now too. It's much easier for EOS/ADA to implement Proof-of-Stake, because their chains are not yet fully running. ETH is, and stil plans on making that change, but the transition is really difficult to pull off. Props to them and cross my fingers that they can do it, but you see what I'm saying. Bitcoin/arguably LTC are stiff, because they have to be.

"You can charge what you want for anything and the market in it will determine if that price will hold. Everything runs through the market.

The value of money is unpinned by the fact that one dollar meets one dollar of obligation. That has not changed ever. The value of gold is not underpinned by your obligation. It is free to fluctuate all over the f'n place. One ounce can be priced to anything at the discretion of the market, but that has not changed the fact that one dollar meets one dollar of obligation. Commodity speculation is what allows speculators to do arbitrage and end up with money to the good. Money ends up being the standard to define even your gain because nothing else is out there able to meet your government obligation. Gold has speculative utility, like Bitcoin ad other commodities.

Assets can be seized from you indirectly by requiring you to come up with them. Failure to do so out of your free will will cost you something at some point. If you keep your Bitcoin you will be living in a rather tight bubble of limited possibilities. This type of argument is in fact the libertarian argument for the destruction of our societal arrangements in favor of free for all. It's incredibly not well thought of since most of what we benefit from in this world comes out of the complexity that we have attained by way of having a system of Laws enforced by governments.

A sovereign nation can in theory never go bankrupt it could originate money until the end of time. All that would change is the commodity value of this money outside of its borders. Debt on the books of government is asset on the books of the private sector. There is always the ability to tax and return to government, via obligation, enough money to have the necessary money flow.

On the last point. A commodity that has limited quantity and that has no obligation to ensure it flows  favors hoarders and the first people to put their hands on it. It will lead to the greatest amount of hierarchy because t can be completely owned and completely manipulated. Fiat cannot. Anyone can borrow against his earning potential because he borrows from himself. No one is beholden to another to pay him a wage for the possibility of him getting his hands on something scarce and necessary. The Bitcoin experiment failed a long time before Bitcoin showed up.

"I'd say we are in the ""Early Adoption"" phase. According to what I remember from my marketing 101 class a few years ago, we are among the first 13% to 15% of all users. Why I believe this? 
1. Blockchain tech still the wild west. Massive scams and criminals run rampant everyday. Governments are only just now forming policies for crypto in the past year.
2. There is no widespread acceptance for crypto as an investment vehicle in the finance world.
3. Very few companies providing blockchain services exist
4. Almost 0 accredited institutions have courses for blockchain. 
5. There is still a large number of people who don't have even a rudimentary understanding of crypto. Maybe they've heard of bitcoin, but they think all crypto is BTC, or that it's a ponzi scheme, or that it's a fad, or that it's a bubble, etc.
6. There are very few people earning money from blockchain (and most are miners), few companies have openings for blockchain professionals, and most job markets have very few if any openings. What does all this mean? It means that blockchain isn't considered a ""real"" job in most places. 

In the future, crypto will be a college major and professionals who work on blockchains will be a common site in big cities with other white collar workers. ",1523369818

"What happened in 2008 with QE was governments devaluing savings accounts to prop up banks.  This is basically theft from the savings of people who keep their money in ""safe"" investments (like GIC/savings accounts etc, anything thats basically valued in dollars, as opposed to stocks which are valued in the % of the company owned... I think I'm using the wrong words here but I hope you get the point).

Basically the governments robbed from the poor to give to the rich.  This was done because there was a great risk that if the rich fell, the rest of society would fall with them.

The problem isn't rooted in what they did, it was necessary.  The problem is that the rich knew that they would get bailed out by the government if they fucked up, thus creating a 'moral hazard.'  The risks associated with banking wasn't placed upon the banks, it was placed upon the middle class.  Banks knew this, and they would be stupid (and uncompetitive with other banks) if they didn't capitalize on this misdirection of risk.

If a bank didn't give out bad loans between 2001 and 2007, they wouldn't be in business because EVERYONE ELSE was giving out bad loans and making huge profits.

With a decentralized currency like bitcoin, governments wouldn't be able to misdirect the risks associated with banking.  Banks would not give out bad loans because they would know that the risk associated with loans solely rests on their own shoulders, not on the shoulders of other people.  Thus the moral hazard would not exist.

With a currency like bitcoin, the financial collapse of 2008 would not have happened, and thus the governments would not have had to print money to fix it.

See what I'm getting at?

HOWEVER

There is a problem with a currency like bitcoin that the article does not discuss.  That problem is the creation of new money via Fractional Reserve Banking.  I know that FRB gets a bad rep around cipherpunks, but it's actually a really innovative way to allow for the creation of value and the measure of negative entropy that humans add to their living system.

What do I mean by this?  Humans via their labour add value to the world.  The amount of wealth (not just measured in currency) is ever increasing, because each day people go out and do things that add value to the world.  Human beings add more value than they remove from the world.

A currency that doesn't grow (like bitcoin, or gold for that matter) doesn't take the growth of value into account.  Bitcoin would be great for a world at equalibrium, where human beings, on average, took as much from the world as they gave back; but thats simply not the reality, human beings add, on average, more than they take.

The counter to my argument is that the advancements made by humans have been on the backs of the environment.  That the world truly is at equalibrium, but we haven't created a proper way to measure the environmental impact humans make.  I'm willing to listen to this, as we truly haven't created a proper way to measure, however, the earth, via receiving sunlight from the closest star will ALWAYS have more input than output into it's value.  The system itself is expanding (until of course the sun explodes and humanity dies).",1523369309

Bitcoin is an open source project, not a company, so it can't have an official representative. The owner of @Bitcoin can therefore legitimately promote any vision for Bitcoin that they want.

"Well, the article makes some assumptions without making it clear that they are assumptions, or justifying those assumptions.

For instance, it talks about governments using the banks to deal with things like the financial crash on 2008. But that financial crash was caused by the banks in the first place, precisely because banks can in effect create money, which is what they did in the sub-prime lending crisis. So, perhaps, if the banks went away, then so would that problem.

Second, it assumes that people will hold Bitcoin (or whatever) because they think it will increase in value. But that assumes that Bitcoin does increase in value, which, in the long term, it can't (sure, it could rise much higher, but there is a limit).

Third, it suggests that there are just too many different coins to be usable. But that is an assumption that because there are currently lots of coins, there will always be lots of coins; it is just as possible that as the ecosystem matures, the number of coins will reduce.

So, I have no idea whether Bitcoin (or whatever) will or will not replace fiat, but the article is just noise without any recognition, leet alone justification, of the assumptions on which it is based.",1523368897

I hate that this happens so frequently with crypto. It's just another thing people will point to as a reason it's dodgy and not worth looking into,1523367640
"lol!!!! Don't know about badass !!!!

Lost interest a little in BCH, think it's great and a better alternative to state issued fiat but like any currency, you need existing wealth to exchange for bitcoin. Something that is never talked about. There is no solution unfortunately, unless you can spread the coin quickly and cheaply to as many people as possible as fast as possible, then as soon as it becomes established the wealthy and powerful buy in, take control and you back to square one with the super rich and powerful back in control but now of the new currency. As seen with BTC I think.
The little guy trying to get by is always going to get screwed.",1523367583

"Not for profit, a lot of people would have spent them on shit they dont need like games and stuff when its price went up. it was genuinely a currency man, i do not remember knowing the crypto anarchist side of it. everyone knew it as currency till 2013ish then it became this thing that can also maybe take over money. Even satioshi wasnt sure about its end game, he just wanted a peer to peer cash system which it was for a long time",1523367527
"Please avoid the term 'bcash'. It is *never* employed by Bitcoin Cash users or supporters; we prefer BCH or the full Bitcoin Cash. 'bcash' is a term invented by opponents of Bitcoin Cash designed to slander the coin and confuse new visitors (BCash is already a Brazilian payment processor).

There are two types of people that honestly use the term 'bcash' - those who want to destroy Bitcoin Cash, and those who don't know about the problem. Now you do.",1523367504
"Fundamentals for say BTC have been pretty much the same over the years, while price has had wild swings, so how do you determine if price is high or low based on the fundamentals?",1523367483
"BCH?

Calling Bitcoin a database? I think you need to study up on the underlying technology.,1523367443
"The *only* positive metric I can find is developer projects to enhance the BCH ecosystem.  The momentum is *massive*, reminds me of when the app store first launched on iPhone.

Most ontry metrics are flat / correlated with the crypto market as a whole.   See [The Flippening: Dream or Destiny?](https://www.yours.org/content/the-flippening---dream-or-destiny--41dfa665f701)",1523367440

"Hi Iruwen,

Thanks for your candid feedback! This is what I'm after!

To address some points made;

1. It's not a data aggregation algorithm at all. I do collect data via crawling but that is raw data that I then feed in to amazon comprehend to detect future dates based off the publication date of an article (among a few other NLP use cases). Thus, being AI driven.

2. Indeed the load more might not be necessary, based off other feedback I could easily make that change!

3. What kind of extra details would you be looking for in the overview or the details? I am trying to keep it as automated as possible without any manual editing, so if you have some suggestions on what your expectations are here, that would be great.

4. I totally agree, this is absolutely in beta, but I'm launching early for this very reason, feedback and fix. I recently quit my job to pursue building ideas and businesses for the following year so I will not be one of those sites that doesn't make it beyond that stage. I plan to build a business from this, whether it sticks to crypto or moves on to pivot to another industry is the only question.",1523367313
"In reality Roger Ver has done a lot of good for bitcoin too. He advertised using his own money for bitcoin. He was just as ""deluded"" at one point totally for bitcoin.  
 
  
However the fork of the people who believed in the bigger block ideology was something he very much believed in. Unfortunately, they were in the minority which is why bitcoin cash is being removed from exchanges for low liquidity. It is really sad for Roger Ver because he is losing a lot of wealth if he had moved the majority of his position to bitcoin cash. Although I'm sure he still has some bitcoin as a hedge.",1523367303

Willing to put $50 on a smart contract bet with you if you're willing to facilitate the code and get my approval on it. lololollol 

who cares abnout credibility when you can make money off your ideology? lol",1523367285
"Yep, they are nailing the coffin in their grave.

Well, the ones that take this route anyways. 

Remember when the US Gov't wanted to run a government based email system that was slower and people had to pay for, just so they could retain full control?

How did that pan out?

The same thing will happen if banks take this approach. The only ones that will be relevant in 30+ years are the ones that get online with adoption.

That doesn't only go for banking, it goes for countries and tax laws/regulation.

What happens if a country like China actually makes crypto illegal? Wealthy people will crypto will start to flee, and governments will try to close their borders. Other countries will be more than happy to accept these massive accounts. 

I can see, in the not too distant future, economical wars being fought over countries trying to keep millionaires in their country, or prevent them from leaving their country.

What happens if somewhere like China or Japan ban crypto and lose massive amounts of rich people, and they all land somewhere like Korea? I can see wars to siege these people's financial accounts happening, and other countries popping up acting as safe havens. Then anti-crypto countries threatening war and sanctions against the havens.

TBH global adoption is very exciting, but the years JUUUUUST before it are kinda terrifying. Or at least their *could* be.",1523367273

"Most of them likely did. The thing about this market is it's easy to look back and say ""wow, imagine if I'd just bought bitcoin in 2010 and held all this time!"" but the reality is much more difficult than that.

Imagine buying/mining some bitcoin in 2010 (worth fractions of a cent at the time) and watching it slowly climb up and up. One day it goes on the mother of all bull runs. It passes 5c. Then 10c. Then 50c. You're on cloud 9. Holy shit, it just reached $1! This magic internet money I bought is going to make me rich!

But suddenly, it crashes from $1 all the way down to 30c. ""What was I thinking?! I got greedy. I should've sold at the top. That money could've bought me a new PC!"".

There have been plenty of times in the history of this market when thing have looked very, very bleak. Even just last year there was a crash around July which I'm sure many people thought was the end of Ethereum. [I stumbled across this video the other day from just July last year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiXS_jjJYY8). This was right after Ethereum crashed from its all time high of ~$400 all the way down to sub-$150. It's literally making fun of holders. ""Mum, it's going to recover, right?"" etc. Of course, as we know it did recover and went all the way to $1400 in early January.

"The idea that 3 billion people will be using decentralized crypto as a replacement for fiat money in 20 years is still a huge assumption. Not only that, but that the politics work themselves out too and the version of that future is decentralized and detangled from banks or governments and remains legal. These are still huge gambles. Oh - and nothing that people have yet to dream up has come along to supplant it.

Posting this stuff is a literal encapsulation of survivorship bias, and people cling to it because it makes them feel better about their assumptions and decisions. Crypto will live or die on both its merits and hundreds of external factors, and the fact that some people believed in the internet earlier than others doesn't make investing your money in crypto any smarter.",1523366897

"In my opinion we are currently at the very early stage of a technology that will change our entire organisational structure. While the technology is more and more used, most people still don't understand what the true value will be, as it is mainly used for speculation and the hope to get rich quick. However it has much broader implications to society, of which many are not currently known or foreseeable. I think I am beginning to grasp some of those. F.e. decentralized company structures. Imagine a city that has an online platform for complaints, where you can for example post a broken streetlight. Currently the city administration (centralized) can then see the problems reported from people and will later send a company to fix the issue and close the thread. Now that seems inefficient compared to people getting rewards for fulfilling tasks themselves (for some you may need certain certificates). So this would mean we could now have an organisational structure, where certain demanded tasks are created by the people and directly solved by the people for a reward. People therefore could work many different jobs, creating a much more diverse work environment, where everyone can participate (creating tasks, solving tasks, monitoring tasks and voting for prioritization). 
What I feel is currently lacking in most crypto investors and enthusiasts is the lack of understanding value networks. While we can exchange coins in a trustless manner on the blockchain or DAG or other forms of public ledgers, this does not mean that those networks create any sort of value, apart from throwing FIAT from a to b, where speculators take profits from other speculators. We need projects that create value in the real world (not money), before exchanging that value in a network. I am for example working on a concept, where coins are minted into a network only after a certain good is produced. In my case environmental goods. I believe crypto can solve many current problems and we are only beginning to grasp it's true potential. For this we need to forget what the FIAT/capitalist global economy has indoctrinated into us and start to reorganize ourselves in a manner, where we think about a fairer distribution of wealth as well as decoupling environmental destruction from FIAT production (paradox if you think about it). Sorry for the mess of thoughts, but it is hard to put such complex relationships into a few sentences.",1523366740
BTC was $900 a little more than a year ago and it's less useful today then it was then.,1523366709

Do you know that this is a 0 sum game?

This is a situation where one person wins, and another loses.

However, when people adopt Bitcoin (or other), and use it for the low cost transactions or as a hedge against government inflation- that creates value. That is no longer 0 sum. ",1523366657

No. This is when you think of bitcoin in terms of price. When looking at the technology the question doesn’t hold. If I didn’t believe in the tech then I would be doing something else.

Yeah, it might, and probably will, pump again, because it's crypto and people just don't care. Maybe they even announce a great partnership, I mean some big VC companies invested more than hundred million dollars in crap like Juicero, that shit happens. But there are so many legitimate projects and privacy coins out there, there's absolutely no reason to support these guys.",1523365846
Enthusiast? How did Bitcoin scale for its first 8 years?,1523365803
probably this.... there is still a debate on what Bitcoin actually is.  With internet companies you knew exactly wtf they were.  with crypto we can't decide whether we want to spend/store/use as a rail system.  Legit dawn....,1523365746

"Because of your comment I invested more free funds into bitcoin and I’m going to spin up a LN node later tonight. 

I love the comparisons of bitcoin to stock or early dotcom ventures. They completely miss the point. 

Bitcoin is the internet of money. I’m not investing in something on top of the network, completely unrelated to the system. I’m investing in the network. I am buying an actual stake in the system. Show me how you can buy an actual stake in the internet itself and not just a business sat on top. 

The internet gained unimaginable value in 2009 when we first started to move value across it. You think the internet lost its value because stocks took a dive in the dotcom era, no way, it was the businesses on top that lost the value. The internet kept on growing and pushed into what it is today. This is what Bitcoin will be replicating. 

Others can say trade and sell and short etc but I’m keeping my bitcoin dry. ",1523365718

And the government wanting you to pay taxes on it and laws are being written to regulate it...people are willing to commit crime to get it, rob, burglarize, hack, etc.  All other cryptos are measured in bitcoins...Bitcoin is being woven into the fabric of society...Bitcoin will be over $100,000 within 7 years. 2025.",1523365692

"Here is what I have to say about gold. It is highly centralized. Central banks, nation states, and large institutions own most of it. So it will only work in their favor to have a fiat backed by gold. And why will it have to be backed. Because we live in a digital world. Next, using gold will come with counter-party risk. And through the test of time these systems fail because of the counterparty. Then you have the redemption aspect. If you want to turn in your fiat for gold it probably won’t happen. This could happen with bitcoin too if the banks, nation states, and central banks ever get the majority supply. ",1523365596

Yes, the windows build isn't out yet, even with the standard electrum acting flaky I'm able to move coins around via XVG Tor-electrum without a problem.  Not every coin has that ultra smooth point and click ease of use like coinbase or other more refined wallets.

"I’ve been hearing “this is like the internet in 1992” for the last 5 years. My 80 year old grandmother talks about Bitcoin now. We’ve been through a great bubble. My neighbor is mining. 

It was 1992 when paper wallets were high security, command line wallets were routine and when you mentioned the word “bitcoin” let alone “cryptocurrency”, most people gave you a blank stare. 

When coinbase makes it easy for the elderly and the retarded to use, with hardware wallets for easy security, with governments launching their own cryptos, tech companies banning crypto ads because crypto ads are actually a thing....we’re like firmly in the early 2000s now. 1999 at best. It’s something most people know exists, the younger generations are using it naturally and the older generation are still scratching their heads at how to adapt to something disruptive on the horizon that is clearly not going away. 

I know you want to believe it’s still 1992 because that means you haven’t missed your shot to 100x....but you probably have. There still plenty of growth to be seen, but now it’s time for crypto to start delivering on that promise on a grand scale like the internet did instead of perpetually being “the internet in 1992.” ",1523364221

"Yes, something that was driven down our throats in finance school was about the semi-strong market theory.  *“If people know the price will go up tomorrow, then the price will go up today.”* That was a mantra that was constantly repeated. 

That’s the reason we saw crypto price soar already.  People were basically betting that crypto had already succeeded and priced it accordingly. 

Eventually a considerable amount of doubt has been cast and so the price got balanced out considerably.  Even $2k bitcoin is still a pretty strong market cap bet that it will be moderately successful for commerce.  Not full economy scale, but many times larger than what we are seeing now. ",1523364001

      Just finding a redeemed bitbills is extremely hard let alone a loaded one. And yes there are people that will pay very high premiums to acquire a loaded Bitbills!

      What is even rarer were the metal Bitbills called Bankcards. Less than 20 were ever sold and very very few are thought to still exist.

Selfish mining does enhance the idea that bigger miners become bigger and bigger and fully centralised. But IMHO efficiency of scale does that to a much larger extent. And we might want to worry some more about the environmental impact like Ethereum is doing by pushing towards PoS. But I digress.

A normal person would not try to bend reality to fit his wants/needs, but CsW isn't a normal person. He sees roadblocks which he needs to obliterate. He's more like a manager who doesn't care/know about tech. 

I guess CsW doesn't understand that the small block arguments do have some merit, just not absolute merit for a 1Mb/1.7kBps block limit. The world isn't black and white in that regard.

It does not reduce the amount of electricity needed if bitmain pumps out tens of thousands of miners like they have done for the s9s. It doesn't matter how effective those miners are at sha256 they are competing against each other and bitmain doesn't give a fuck how high the difficulty will go they just pump out miners. The difficulty of owning the hashrate of the network is what creates a secure network. Asics are a lot easier to centralize with a 51% attack.. I'm pretty sure bitmain now owns 51% of the bitcoin hashrate from a post I saw yesterday. They owned 77% of the monero hashrate before it Forked too. Bitmain is the centralization we are trying to fight against. ,1523363802

"&gt;But that had nothing to do with the point of the DAA. If fine if its not related to this. But right now fees are low, so thats not really an argument,


It was in response to the block(the)stream ""literally killing babies"" thing you mentioned a little up in the thread


&gt;As I said, 0-conf works exactly the same on bitcoin core as on bitcoin (cash). If only you pay the fee to get in the next block. Blocktimes are the same, and replace-by-fee is optional. You can do (the fundamentally flawed) 0-conf tx if you want to if you just pay the fee!


The problem is if bitcoin ever recovers from the big dump its sent the market into and becomes popular again, fees will rise, and double spends will become more likely. With BCH its nearly impossible to double spend because you're guaranteed to get into the next block for essentially free. With Bitcoin Core, it's just about sending a ""low"" fee transaction, knowing it won't ever get accepted into the blockchain and voila. With RBF on top of that makes accepting 0-conf even more dangerous, even though you can just ignore rbf transactions. RBF is the one and only reason people consider unconfirmed transactions across all of crypto, (even real currencies like BCH) unsafe by default.


&gt;But the principle is the same with the new DAA - it is there to keep bcash alive. Bcash *cannot survive with bitcoins DAA. It would die if it changed to it.

I mean call it what you want, but in my mind it's a fix to a issue that has been in bitcoin forever. We can adjust difficulty relatively quickly, even if we lose half of our miners in a in an hour from now. If BTC lost half of its hashpower during the next difficulty raise, it would be unable to confirm transactions more than once or so an hour, and fees would return to a rise uncontrollably as people rush to get their coins on exchanges to avoid having to spend 50-80% on fees like they had to for the past year. 


Now BCH never has these hyperinflation periods, but with with BTC on the other hand I can see this being used as a really good attack vector in the future.


&gt;* bitcoin cash was being utterly destroyed by it. In the few months this was happening bitcoin cash got ahead of bitcoin by about 100,000 coins (!!!!!!).

And also went up in price to 0.5 BTC regardless, and brought bitcoin to dump over 70% in the matter of hours in the most profitable month of trading I had all 2017. 

Even though I don't like the extra inflation we got, a lot of really big-name traders I know were using the BCH vs BTC hashrate at the time to determine when to stop trading for the night. 

Unrelated to the discussion, but had it not been for that major ddos attack crippling every exchange for a up to 9 hour period right when korea and china were waking up to trade, it would have without doubt taken over the number one spot from BTC that day, just based on the pure amount of volume going from BTC -&gt; BCH (about 10% of the entire crypto marketcap at the time). Bitcoin is in a very fragile spot, and because of BCH people know that now, so wasting time on broken, DOA solutions like lightning and segwit instead of fixing the real problems is a really worrying sign, especially considering Core/Blockstream's ties to banking and pro-government organizations.",1523363341

[For the record, the NASDAQ has only reached 87 on 14 month RSI in 1% of it's history, in 1996, 1986, and 1955. All 3 times, after hitting 87, 3 of the greatest Bull markets to ever exist happened.](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/23/stocks-have-not-been-this-overbought-in-22-years-says-technician.html) 

&gt;Every MACD cross down as obviously a false signal.

Nothing is obvious in technical analysis, and back testing MACD proves that it's basically useless. Again, backtesting takes feeling and luck out of the equation, and help paint a better picture. Even if you do find success backtesting, the hardest part is after that: to ensure you aren't curve fitting. 

&gt;Learn price action and you would've been able to make a ton of money trading the bull/bear flags.

Price action isn't some mythical thing that people can get good at by experience. There is no feedback loop for it; it's impossible to know if you are being lucky, or being smart. 

Consolidation periods are one of the only times you can make money using technicals, but that isn't because technicals are doing anything: it's because you are cutting your losses using stops, and letting your gains ride.

Even then, back testing reveals that you under perform the bench mark, because you can not time the tops, or the bottoms, with any system of logic. In other words: if you make money trading flags, it's because you're on the lucky side of the bell curve, not because you're smart. 

I actually use technicals, but only in arbitrage. They are extremely helpful when applied correctly. However, the conditions to apply them correctly don't exist in bitcoin.

"&gt;  I havn't looked at it but since mining is less centralized (because of no asics)

I'm anti-Reddit here. I saw what happened with Segwit, how it was first denied, because it caused miners to get less in fees and it still pushed through, because of pool re-alignment. Bitmain is also no longer the sole producer of ASICs, though still the most popular one. Another thing to always keep in mind is that they sell these things and don't just produce ASICs to use them for themselves to eventually take over Crypto entirely. I think people are overly paranoid and forget that we're still in infant stage. So are ASICs. 


To me, eventually ASICs will not hinder decentralization at all, so that all you're left with is stronger software for the chain. 


Bcash with blocksize increase to infinity will have centralization problems eventually, because nobody will find a hardware that can store their chain. 

&gt; I guess one could just as well categorize LTC


LTC is better for transactions, whilst still being decentralized. It's real cheap to send LTC and they also have the potential of LN enhancements and they might add crosschain swaps with BTC, so that LTC will remain relevant and sort of act like Bitcoin Cash, only that it works and is not a scam. I don't love LTC, but I don't mind it either. They have their niche. 


&gt; I'm not sure about how much the dev/team owns but as far as I'm aware, there was no premine or anything like that. I'm not here to shill Vertcoin, I don't even own any at this time (though I have in the past), I just honestly consider it one of the more open/transparent, decentralized and honest coins out there


I'm on their page already and studying. It does seem like a real great coin to me too. Will definitely look into it more. 


And to potentially avoid confusion. I don't mind ASICs in Bitcoin. I do mind ASICs in Alt/Shitcoin. We saw how much power they had in Monero, when they claimed to be ASIC resistant. Almost 80% of power was gone, just like that. I think small market cap alt/shits alike, need ASIC resistance, at least for the first time being - so they spread better.

"The best way to compare is to look at following things...

1. Size of the markets before dot.com crashed - it was a multi-trillion dollar market. As with each subsequent bubbles, market cap usually tends to be higher before a massive crash. My guess is, this is just another interim crash and the next massive one will be when crypto is at $10T mcap or more.

2. Number of projects/companies being newly created or have existed during beginning of dot.com crash. I believe crypto is in mid-90s of dot.com in terms of that. We have only seen new projects popping up in 2017.

3. Purpose and scale of what internet companies promised versus reality when crash happened. Internet companies certainly promised to change the world for better. But compare to something like bitcoin whose promise is to replace the whole currency of the world - order of magnitude higher proposition. Although internet companies looked like multi-billion dollar promises, they never really meant to embark on a multi-trillion dollar value proposition. Crypto is promising simply another level. This suddenly makes $10T I mentioned in my first point not that ambitious anymore.

4. Awareness and information accessibility. During internet days, there was amost no easy or faster means to gather information or spread awareness. Hell - the whole premise of internet was to bring that. So obviously people had far less information that they do now. I am not saying there is dumb money in crypto - there’s loads of it, more than one could wish for. But its not for the lack of information availability. It’s mostly due to FOMO and get rich quick mentality which did not change much over the years. Having said that - the current age of information flow certainly adds a lot of value to how an avg investor is able to evaluate before investing into something.",1523361580

"&gt; We'll see higher numbers there because the average of all leverages being used is 10x or more.

Exactly, which is absolutely fucking nuts if I may say so? 

Did you guys not read what OP said? Check it yourself, these frequent bumps in price entirely destroy many positions. This *could* be market manipulation, but to me it's stupid exploitation instead. 


We all know there's still people with vast amounts of BTC. They cash out, your short is dead - and no TA can predict when a whale cashes out. 

Additionally it seems to be known fact that a mere 80 million dollar can manipulate the price in a way that it causes a 5% up or down immediately. Again, people lose, crypto lose, exchanges win in casino fashion. 



I do not actually blame the exchanges for that, but the idiot people executing these positions. Man, if you know what you are doing then please go ahead and gamble. Obviously some people *will* inevitably get rich by using these leverages. 


My question is more so, why normal Bitcoin/Crypto gains are seemingly not enough? It's also not like I'm the total cripple that only believes HODL'ing can work. 


I've thought about leverages ranging from 2x-3x myself, but 10-25-100x? My capital is not big enough to manipulate myself, so to me it would feel a lot like I'm hoping to predict the market. A market known to be unpredictable at that. 



I honestly wonder whether or not what Bitmex does is legal though. They offer 100x not to just professionals after all, but really to any Joe that comes along and wants to have a go. I do believe in free market and if there's demand for executing 100x trades, then please go ahead, but to me it just seems so immesenly dumb, simply because I know that this Crypto shit we're all doing is a *long* game. The short-term is entirely unpredictable, at least to me. 





I honestly can't decide whether or not I would like the average noob to burn their money and give it to exchanges, or whether I would rather see Joe invest in Crypto long term. Obviously one helps crypto growth more than the other, but at the same time, these markets do attract a lot more people.

But know that most people don't start positions like that. They start at a reasonable leverage and a low risk. When the price moves in their favor, they adjust a stop, so that at worst they can break even. Then they're free to increase their leverage and increase their position size while keeping the same initial amount risked.

There is nothing relevant in Liu &amp; Wang paper that Wright should have pointed out.

Liu &amp; Wang start from Kolmogorov's ""basic"" theorem and go to another level with it.

Wright uses Kolmogorov's ""basic"" theorem and applies the formula for bitcoin.

Both of them cite Kolmogorov. Each of them use another version of the book. Liu &amp; Wang: Springer, New York, 1982; Wright: Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg,1983.

Wright's paper is a critique - not a claim to have found something new.
Rather he elaborates how various works from different authors could apply to bitcoin. (I'm not saying he is right or wrong. I describe what I see.)

Let us all read together what he writes here;

3 SOLUTION TO BLOCK PUZZLES
The process of solving blocks can be modeled using a Bernoulli trial (Feller, 1968). This means each
miner must decide whether to engage in mining, thereby determining their investment in the system. In
effect, this is equivalent to a non-anticipative system of lottery bets that form a sequence of Bernoulli trials.
Each Bernoulli trial has a probability of success in each block that 1) is independent and 2) relates to the
relative amount of investment in hardware and computational power used to secure the blockchain.
The nature of this problem type was reviewed by von Mises (1928, p. p 186) and was later expanded by
Kolmogorov (1982). Both of these researchers recognized that it is impossible to create a gambling system to
unfairly benefit the initiator in the form proposed by Eyal and Gün (2013). This was stated in the original
2008 paper: “The probability of an attacker catching up from a given deficit is analogous to a Gambler's Ruin
problem” (Nakamoto, 2008).
• Is independent.
• Relates to the relative amount of investment in hardware and computational power used to
secure the Blockchain.
The present paper presents the mathematical foundation of Bitcoin mining. The notation of random
selection is the centerpiece of the system. It demonstrates how Bitcoin’s selection function extends the notion
of Feller (1968) and Nakamoto (2008) based on the work of Kolmogorov (1982) through the use of values in
an interval.
We start by defining each discovered block as a time interval: ......

What I see is that he is very clear on where he got what from.

What comes from Wright is the elaboration: Why this is relevant to bitcoin.

"&gt; The difference is that the existing financial world is regulated. You can sue, you can win if a wrong is done to you. You cannot do insider trading, pump and dumps etc.

Even if something is done wrong, that doesn't mean you will win. The people with more money are the ones that win. Sure there are times when things do reach justice, but the ones that can put the most cash in lawyers are the ones that win most of the time.

Banks get fines, but that is pennies for them (this was discussed on reddit during the SEC and CFTC talk a few months back. Their track record was discussed about how many violations they had done during the past year and that the SEC and CFTC are aware of this). 

Recently (years time) have things gotten more regulated. Before brokers would do these things like what crypto exchanges do. (i have searched for forex brokers myself because i am a trader. Some have bad histories, you can check yourself).

And you know only the tip of the iceberg about insider trading. Yes there are people that have been caught, but i can ask you a question that relates to this: 

*""How well is the airport security doing at catching illegal contraband or in general catching people carrying illegal items?""*

You don't know that. You can't possible know that, because you just don't know how many people actually pass with illegal items so you can't do a statistic about it, because you don't know **how many people carry illegal items overall**, because of that you can't make a percentage.

Same goes for insider trading, you don't know how many people do it and how well it is regulated, because you don't know how many do it overall. Insider trading is done in secrecy and what classifies insider trading is when you have information that is not open to the public, which you can gain financial advantage of. 

By that definition, if Donald Trumps son knows about an upcoming fathers tweet which will affect a certain companies stocks to go down, the son can short it and gain money. That already is insider trading and tracing it isn't always simple, because the example i give here is very primitive.

No, there are different updates for different groups. Change-logs are part of the open-source developer culture and are targeted at developers. Investor communications are differently worded and contain way less technical detail. 

After reading the announcement, are you able to explain to me in simple words what the hell all that wall of text means. I'm not a developer and I think neither are you and 99% of crypto investors.

I would, but it would cost me about 1.5h to translate it and re-check to make sure everything is right. That's 1.5h a team member could not develop the product further. With all back and forth, its about 1/3 to half of a work day lost. If you absolutely need this level of detail as an investor, then you need to learn the lingo. But honestly, if you want to argue that your investment decisions are driven by implementation details of a supply chain graph, I wouldn't believe you.

The Kübler-Ross model - otherwise known as the five stages of grief - postulates a progression of emotional states experienced by both terminally ill patients after diagnosis and by loved-ones after a death. The five stages are chronologically: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance.

The model was first introduced by Swiss psychiatrist Elisabeth Kübler-Ross in her 1969 book On Death and Dying, and was inspired by her work with terminally ill patients. Motivated by the lack of instruction in medical schools on the subject of death and dying, Kübler-Ross examined death and those faced with it at the University of Chicago medical school.

Since you asked the question, ask yourself also, how much do I actually know? 



You know Bitcoin. You know *some* accept Bitcoin as payment, but definitely not all stores whatsoever. It also highly depends on where you live and how big your city is. Do you know how you would use it, to pay say ... with your phone? Because that would be the only option. 


You can have wallets on your phone, but they're mostly regarded not safe.  Ledger is where you wanna keep your coins and even then you need a laptop with oyu at all times to make use of your coins at any time. 


Then there's transaction fees. Whilst not currently, and hopefully never again a problem, December did expose a huge weakness. Hopefully fixed for the future with Segwit and LN, but we don't know for sure. Bcash holds the argument for example, that transactionfees are low, because volume is also low. We have to find out abotu that and see for ourselves. 


Because surely you don't want to buy a Bigmac for 4$ and pay 20$ in fees. 





Then there's ease of use. As I said, you *can* use it on your phone and you *will* be able to soon aswell, to do it securely too. But we're not there yet. If you want to keep BTC on your phone, you use a third-party for storage, which is something you don't want to do, when one of the main benefits is that the currency is decentralized. 




You see problems over problems, but they're all problems which will be solved in the future. 



Back a few years ago, you HAD TO download the entire blockchain and store your coins on your computer. That was, almost, the only way. Nowadays it's a lot easier, but it's still not as easy as say ... VISA. Plug card in, pay, plug out. Done. No/little fees. 




The road is long and the developers in the sphere are people too. They're not mashines or robot, that snap their fingers and have a solution for cutting edge Fintech innovation. Give it time to grow. Whether it's BTC infrastructure you look forward too, or whether you want to see some specific Altcoin to succeed/take over is up to you. 


But it's the same for all of them. They're not there yet, but Crypto in general *gradually* gets there. 




What stage we're at? 



I usually picture it as some kind of ladder we need to climb, exponentially. 2009/10 you had crazy geeks/Cypherpunk people doing BTC. 2012/13 came the drug/illegal people. Following years you had more and more exchanges open and it became gradually easier to use. 

We're not at the stage, where both IT/Ecnomics students are picking up on the trend, I think. My friends around me and myself, we're all very interested in Crypto. My mother isn't. Average person isn't. 




But we are increasing exponentially still I would say. Adoption, least to me, is not a specific point, which is reached after X days. It's a gradual process and being more and more adopted over time, until eventually of course, everybody uses it. ",1523357348
"&gt; It will be centralised. Why would Alice lock funds into a channel with Bob, when they already both opened a channel with Amazon (for example)? It makes no economic sense to lock up your own money with a poorly connected node, just in case you need to receive money from them. So everybody opens a channel with Amazon because everybody else is connected to them. Amazon has your name, your phone number and your shipping address. Alice sends money to Bob, it goes through Amazon and Amazon is privvy to the entire transaction and you are doxxed to them.

1. When Amazon sees that everyone opens channels with it because it's so convenient, they will start charging hefty fees for the privilege of using them for routing, simply because they can - just like banks do.

When that happens, there will be natural economic pressure to start opening channels with smaller routers who charge competitive fees, decentralizing the network.

2. Everyone will have a few counterparties they are in frequent business dealings with - employer, favorite restaurants, etc. The user will likely want to have a direct channel with them - which would be cheaper and faster than through Amazon. But when each node is connected to a few of his real-world peers, a network starts emerging organically.

&gt; Alice wants to send money to Bob. Bob doesn't have any channel open. Alice can't send funds to Bob.

""Not having an open channel"" is the LN equivalent of having no Bitcoin wallet. You can't send bitcoins to someone without a wallet, and you can't send an LN payment to someone without a channel. You need to actually start using the system in order to use it.

&gt; Alice wants to send $100 worth of Bitcoin to Bob. They are both connected to Amazon with a channel. Bob opened a channel with $100 but Bob just bought a new toothbrush. Alice cannot send $100 to Bob.

This seems a bit confused, if Bob has just bought something it will be *easier* for Alice to send him money.

In any case, Bob should have several channels with spare capacity.

&gt; Alice is a normal person. She just wants to pay for something. She finds out she needs to run a Bitcoin node 24/7 or there is some other thing called a watchtower that she has to trust with her money. Alice just pays on her VISA card.

She doesn't need to run a Bitcoin node. Watchtowers have no control of the money, so the more the merrier.

&gt; Bob has $500 left in his channel with his employer and wants to save it. He must now close the channel so he can move his BTC to a wallet he has the keys for. Next salary is coming. How does Bob get paid? His channel is closed.

These scenarios get a bit more complicated to analyze, but the simplest thing to do here is to create a new channel each month. This means the user will still need 1 on-chain tx per month, but can then do 100 payments throughout the month without requiring on chain.

By having enough channels and spare capacity, you can reduce the frequency to less than 1 on-chain per month.

&gt; Also, Bob's employer noticed Bob is saving $500

That's not so easy. Lightning payments are onion-routed, and all the pseudonymity techniques that work with raw Bitcoin work here.

&gt; and denies his next salary increase review.

That's silly. Such an employer isn't worth working for anyway.


One more thing that you should keep in mind - you *will* also have the option to pay on-chain. It won't be the cheapest or fastest but it can be done if for some reason LN fails at any given moment. I don't know exactly what % of payments will be on LN - I hope it's most of them, but even in the highly unlikely scenario that it's relegated to just nano-transactions (sub-cent), it's still an important platform, and those working on it should be proud.

"It's impossible to know the margin level used but usually the people getting rekt are using 25,50,100x margin. 

The most you can lose is your amount put up in the position, which is effected by margin level and position size. 

Example: $10,000
At 100x you put up about $100 worth of Bitcoin as collateral against the trade. If you get liquidated (rekt) you lose that $100 essentially. This happens at about a $50-$70 price swing against your position.

At 50x, you're putting up $200.  At 25x, 400. The lower the margin level the farther away the price has to move to liquidate you. 

Bitmex uses what's called mark price to determine liquidation levels. Mark price is a composite of gdax and another exchange (can't remember).

You don't need block chain for that. Overcomplicate things much?

&gt; If gamers are willing to spend a lot of money on items that they do not actually own, how much more will they be willing to spend if they know that they can re-coup that value? We believe that publishers stand to gain from primary sales simply by activating true ownership.

You don't need blockchain for that. Also, if players can ""re-coup"" the value they invested in a game, that's less money for the publisher. If that value or even a portion is transferred to another game by the publisher, that's money not spent by the player. You're giving away shit for free in that move.

&gt; We want to facilitate seamless transactions such that someone who creates value for herself in a virtual world, say, by looting an enemy in a game can use that value to enhance their real-world situation, like buy a cup of coffee with her earnings the next morning.

... what the fuck are you guys smoking?

&gt; Reason 3: Maintain trust in an increasingly decentralized world

No one trusts most game publishers as it is. Blockchain doesn't change that. It doesn't automatically imbue trust. This article is retarded. I'm only half way through.

&gt; This token model also enables publishers to take advantage of new ways of raising funds for games.

Indiegogo, kickstarter, and whatever other platforms already exist to do this.

&gt; Some of the ways it can be used to increase security in games include blocking identity theft, preventing data tampering and stopping Denial of Service attacks. It can also eliminate double spending and unauthorised duplicate content.

blocking identity theft? uh huh... prevent data tampering in a game? if your data can be tampered with, you have a problem. obviously clients can be fucked with, but the responsibility is on the devs to NEVER TRUST THE CLIENT. blockchain doesn't solve this. how the fuck are you going to stop a DDOS with blockchain?

&gt; Reason 6: Provide easier and more secure in-game transactions
&gt; whereby buyers and sellers don’t have a pay a bank to hold funds in escrow and every transaction is stored immutably.

Most also happen to know nothing about distribution of coins. Do you know how NANO got distributed? How STEEMIT got distributed?

"Much of your rant strikes true, but the traditional financial world is not a safe place either. You can still be tricked into 'investing' your money into ponzi schemes and other scams. You can lose money by government intervention, and you are being taxed indirectly via forced inflation.

That does not reduce the fact that cryptocurrencies have the potential to become the new standard. New and innovative projects are popping up everywhere, more than just variants of the same ERC20 token coins, or forks of Bitcoin/Monero/whatever. A good example is Nano, which has a different structure (block lattice) and requires no miners due to working with dPoS.

"That's not what I'm saying.  I'm saying that any point in time the selfish mining cartel has a choice.  By definition in the Sirer - Eyal paper the Honest Miner only mines honestly.

If the Selfish Mining Cartel follows the Selfish Mining Strategy, it is true they get more of their share of the block reward.  Furthermore it is true that after difficulty adjusts to account for lost hashes on orphans block times will be 10 minutes.  However, if the difficulty has been lowered such that block times are 10 minutes when the Selfish Mining Cartel orphans the network and causes lost hashrate, this means if the Selfish Mining Cartel chooses to follow the Honest Mining Strategy there will be no orphans.  Without lost orphans block times will be much faster than 10 minutes until difficulty adjusts.  Like I said, Bitcoin is a lever.  You are only examining what happens when you push on the lever.

Like the governments which are about to be destroyed by crypto? Why aren't they just throwing their weight around to stop it? Because they can't, that's exactly the point, this mechanism allows us to ignore their interference, not involve them in trade at all, cut them out of the loop entirely and they won't have even visibility into what's going on.

Then whatever infrastructure you erect will necessarily be too high above others and you have failed. The best you can do is allow the natural order to assert itself, end of story. Free market currencies immune from tampering by political authorities will do that, it's what they are for.

Consequently, they need to have enough stake in the new system that they cannot simply be steam-rolled over by someone naturally at the top of it.

I'm not against crypto; if it's well designed and grown properly, it can be a great tool to disrupt our current problem with goverments and central banks. But crypto doesn't do everything; we can't just sit back and look the other.way and expect crypto to take care of everything for us. We must stay vigilant and be ready to defend ourselves when someone starts getting in the position to become the next big bad. And wherever possible, we need to setup the conditions to discourage people from getting too high above the others; even if at first we manage to end up with a benevolent dictator, when they're gone there wouldn't be much to stop the wrong people from filling the power vacuum and redirecting the machinery against the population. Horrendous things have been done for the sake of profit because someone got big enough to set their own rules (and in a few cases, just because they thought they were big enough). 

The free market is great at a lot of things, but by itself it doesn't have all it needs to remain free under all circumstances.

"rent-seeking doesn't work unless you can have an artificial hold on the market. On LN you can't since running a supernode isn't especially resource intensive. LN fees will be in a race to the bottom, every bottleneck will be routed around automatically. 

The thing is that real distance between every node is technically 1. Any node can open a channel to every other node. There is no way to limit this. Deutche Bank can't prevent me from opening direct channels wherever i want. Large hubs aren't a liability since they don't control your money and they don't know whose money they are routing.

The improvement over a regular blockchain is that you can have more or less infinite amounts of transactions in real-time without burdening the blockchain.

It is very complex now for sure but if you were going to explain a mobile phone bitcoin wallet from basic concepts you would soon reach ridiculous amounts of complexity as well. ",1523353008

Thanks fore this OP, even though most of us remember these traderbois losing all through last ten years, seeing it for ourselves gives us a whole new perspective and regain the hope we have lost due to all these idiots entering in last 4 months. 

Also notice how market has never gone up when even one 'investor' has hopesit will go up. Look at the despair points, theyre absolute despair. and People were still buying then.

1) Check out which coins have been around for a while

2) Check out which communities have genuine development chat

"No it can't, Bitcoin is a near complete graph, other miners giver your connection priority in proportion to your hash power.

The paper basically says you must sybil the network so that you can release the hidden block once the honest block is presented to your node. The issue is that because of the first seen rule the sybil node will never be able to get out the block before the HM. People think that the first seen rule is altruistic but it's not, it is selfish and untrusting of everyone else.

As a miner you don't trust anyone to provide the correct information unless it is crypto graphically provable so they just go by the order they see things. Otherwise they might fall for someone trying to scam them. Connections are built up proportional to information provided that is cryptographically provable and valuable, i.e. blocks and transactions with blocks given much much much more weighting.

Recent examples: ICX got boosts two weeks ago, i wake up to +30% and sell immediately, bought NEO (bleeding a lot since jan). VEN last week, +20% two times during that week, both times i sold and bought NEO. yesterday, NEO is up +20%, i sell NEO and buy VEN back.

"Also if gamma is greater than 0 Selfish Mining can work, however, the gamma question is another discussion entirely.  I just want you to re-do your math for Selfish Mining when gamma=0, because you are wrong and you are good enough at math to realize it.  I also don't want anyone to think that I'm saying Selfish Mining is not a threat.  In fact, even armed with the knowledge that Selfish Mining is never profitable when gamma=0, we should still be very scared of a Selfish Mining attack when gamma=0.  Why you might ask?  Because even though an attacker using the Selfish Mining strategy necessarily suffers a loss compared to honest mining, the loss the Selfish Miner suffers is much smaller proportionally compared to that of the loss of the Honest Miners.  This means an attacker with deep pockets (i.e. a tyrannical state) could perform a Selfish Mining attack and even if gamma=0 the state attacker would know that they would be losing less money than everyone else.  So Selfish Mining, even if less profitable than Honest Mining, is still probably the most dangerous attack facing any POW crypto.

"**KISS principle**

KISS is an acronym for ""Keep it simple, stupid"" as a design principle noted by the U.S. Navy in 1960. The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore simplicity should be a key goal in design and unnecessary complexity should be avoided. The phrase has been associated with aircraft engineer Kelly Johnson (1910–1990). The term ""KISS principle"" was in popular use by 1970.

Not to mention that in trading you can always start with a demo account (no real money involved) until you can work out a strategy. Consider it as a tutorial in games.  
One of the first rules in trading is not to invest more than you can afford to lose. And I'm an example for it - started trading cryptos for fun with 20$. Currently balanced at ~100$. Not 1$ invested (exept for the time I spen in trading). Got them from faucets. There were losses, just like in gaming - you can't win them all. There were big wins. If I had cashed out when the BTC was at 19k - I would have had ~350$. But considering the start of only 20$ - i`m pretty happy as it is.

Blockstream nor Ver owns the Bitcoin brand. However, Ver *does* own the “Bitcoin.com” brand. I would think it’s perfectly reasonable for the Bitcoin twitter handle to carry on with an opinionated personality if it were as the Bitcoin.com handle instead.

You may disagree, but I feel it’s almost the same as if a Twitter profile represented itself as the official Twitter for the U.S. dollar, and then spouted anti-fed views.

"&gt;Craig's point in the entire presentation that he gave was that network topology has a great deal to do with the feasibility of the SM attack in the first place, and that the authors of SM paper didn't take this into account.

&gt;And furthermore, if the SM attack was conducted as many have postulated (through a mesh of nonminers) then that would be counter productive (and thus his clumsy statement about gamma).

&gt;These are legitimately interesting and value added viewpoints.

&gt;Watching the presentation makes that patently clear to me, and this seems confirmed by /u/justsomebadadvice

&gt;But yes, he did say the two words ""negative gamma"" in this presentation and at that point a lot of people simply stopped listening to anything he had to say.

We so profoundly disagree about Craig, what he was getting at, and how well he conveyed that, that I don't know what to say at this point. The conclusion he was going for is much stronger than ""Here are some ways the actual topology of the Bitcoin network limits gamma, and given the topology launching a Sybil with network nodes is probably a waste of time and money."" If that's all he was trying to do then he needs to curb his rhetoric because regardless of what the most giving and generous interpretation in the world ascribes to his thought process he came nowhere near establishing his conclusion. An SM attack is about as viable an attack vector as a 51% attack and calling it a ""cancer"" and ""pseudo-science"" and questioning the math behind it was dumb.

Moreover, if you had interpreted me as generously as Craig you would realised my opinion has never changed. I've conceded many times that the topology Craig describes is accurate. I can link to several times where I've said this if you like. I can't recall if I conceded that adding 0-power nodes might not be a good idea from a cost-benefit perspective. But that point did seem plausible to me at the time. If you were as generous to me as you are to Craig you would realise the things I expressed to JustSomeBadAdvice are the same as what I felt the entire time we were arguing. 

&gt;When I tried to make the points that /u/justsomebadadvice made, you tried desperately to disbelieve them, but now you seem satisfied that you're getting some good advice. So since you seem to have come around, do you now agree that the SM paper appears flawed in at least two ways:

&gt;It does not take into account mining topology

It doesn't take into account mining topology because it doesn't need to. Gamma can range over all values from 0 to 1 and thus account for any possible network topology. The aside in the paper about Sybil nodes is irrelevant in terms of the viability of the attack. 

&gt;It does not take into account any impact on incentives

This I agree, but in the same sense that one could argue that incentives protect against 51% attacks. It does not mean the model presented by SM is not valuable for studying and understanding blockchain security, or that a selfish mining attack is ""impossible.""

I will say though, I don't like how both you and Craig seem to be hand-waving an inquiry into whether miners are or should be incentivized to blacklist or greylist a miner launching an SM from FIBRE. A description of how such a system could be built in such a way that it didn't punish honest miners who had the occasional orphan and didn't break the ability to achieve concensus (because all the miners are running their own custom heuristics to blacklist SMs) is important if that's necessary for Bitcoin's security, and you're doing Bitcoin no favours with these hand-waves.",1523346832
"To be honest, I stopped caring about ""power to the people"" aspect of crypto when it become obvious power always consolidates in the hands of the few, and those few take from the many. 95% of investors don't care at all about the libertarian aspects of it, and the leaders take advantage of the other 5% to push their narrative.

Blockstream and the mining pools basically control BTC, Vitalik and Co forked ETH to recover their investors funds and wield massive influence, Charlie Lee is jumping on whatever train he wants, Roger Ver is literally referred to as ""Crypto Jesus"" due to the influence he has, Coinbase and the exchanges facilitate insider trading and destroy people with fees, the whole Bitfinex/Tether situation etc. The list goes on.

BTC is no longer a trustless peer to peer currency system, it's now claimed as a store of value. If the BTC community leaders don't even follow Satoshis vision or care about decentralization why should I?

I've transitioned into caring about the money. I don't believe the traditional banking system is going anywhere any time soon, and even if it does the crypto billionaires will just take their place and begin the cycle of exploitation all over again. Exchanges act like banks with absurd fees and price manipulation is rampant all over the space by early investors. The new cryptorich and exchanges already manipulate us and take advantage of us as much as the traditional banking system does, with none of the safeguards

What would happen if the banks closed all fiat gateways? Sure, there are ways around it but realistically it would be a huge blow. If it's truly that big of a threat, they can lobby for regulation as well.

I know decentralization is also about security, making sure no trust is involved, that networks are secure from attack. By BTC maximalists own admission the network can be spammed into uselessness, they claim spam drove the tx fees up to $50 and times into hours/days. That's not a traditional attack, but it makes it practically useless. So now we have to trust people not to make the network useless, and even then it's now a store of value somehow, despite being wildly volatile? Not only that, all it would take is 2 or 3 large mining pools to team up for a 51% attack before anyone knew what was happening.

How is any of that a trustless peer to peer digital currency? 95% of crypto investors have become a community of lambo chasing moon bois, NEO is controlled by a handful of Chinese nodes, btc.com has 33% of the hash rate, many ICOs are holding back 20-50% for adoption incentives and funding, and basically every ERC20 was essentially premined and 100% owned and sold by a company, just like XRP. If you think the movers and shakers of the other cryptocurrencies aren't massively profiting off of them then people are delusional, 

I care if it makes me money. If you are all honest with yourselves, that's why you are here too. If cryptocurrency did not have the potential to make money would you be involved? You can say ""Well, it can be both"", but realistically for 95% of you it's all about the gains. Cryptocurrency has developed into a parody of what it once was, the original vision is basically irrelevant at this point, so why not invest in something with real potential?

It's every man for himself these day,.

"&gt; My point is that pricing people out of crypto leaves the with no other option than to use state-backed currency.

But that had nothing to do with the point of the DAA. If fine if its not related to this. But right now fees are low, so thats not really an argument, and we have LN on the way together with many other scaling solutions before blocksize is increased. This will not be a problem. If anything the plan is to make bitcoin the cheapest solution for everyone. Both to become your own bank (run your own node and never rely on 3rd parties, something that bcash has no priority to do) and for small payments (LN network will be the cheapest solution).

&gt; With bitcoin it's trivially easy to double spend because of high fees, long blocktimes and most importantly replace-by-fee.

As I said, 0-conf works exactly the same on bitcoin as on bcash. If only you pay the fee to get in the next block. Blocktimes are the same, and replace-by-fee is optional. You *can* do (the fundamentally flawed) 0-conf tx if you want to if you just pay the fee!

&gt; Bitcoin had more or less the same issue, although to a slightly lesser extent. Everyone switched to BCH and BTC was unusable for hours, then suddenly when BTC became a few procent more profitable and everyone switched back difficulty lowered, causing early inflation, repeat.

Sure, it wasn't good for BTC either with the EDA (but muuuuuuch much worst for bcash*). But the principle is the same with the new DAA - it is there to keep bcash alive. Bcash *cannot* survive with bitcoins DAA. It would die if it changed to it.

&gt; I mean, its what pretty much the entire crypto space has been doing forever.

It has proven is ability to function. *Not* proven to scale, which is the whole issue.

&gt; we can simply stop mining large blocks.

If you ever get to that it would utterly destroy bcash. If would leave you with the worst of both worlds. Extremely expensive transactions in a completely centralized environment. That is exactly why bitcoin goes to the route of making the absolutely best use of already available blockspace before increasing throughput (blocksize). Once you go there, there is no turning back.

&gt; Segwit doesn't really do anything aside from tainting the blockchain with anyone-can-spend transactions

Its not possible to know. All you know is that you increase your chances of being successful by doing this. Remember, you don't need to be successful every time as attempting double spending is free.

This is *not* a concensus rule. Its not even possible to implement this as a concensus rule.

No. As you can see (on doublespend.cash), the XT nodes don't use that policy. They just relay any tx they see. Miners are also free to implement whatever mempool policy they want.

Again no. The POS system I've seen promoted on rbtc relies on an SPV model. This is the absolutely worst solution you can think off. Here you must trust the node you are connected to that the tx you recieve is valid, plus there is no monitoring of the network for double spends. Monitoring of the network for double spends is the absolutely most important tool to warn merchants that a double spend is being attempted, and thats why bitpay and other payment processors are much safer than simply doing it yourself with a simple SPV POS setup, and thats the whole problem.

Also, if the 0-conf model is relied on heavily on bcash it becomes an excellent attack vector. You can completely destroy trust in 0-conf by simply setting up a mining pool that does not forward transactions. Anyone can send the double spend to them, and depending on the hashrate you get a proportional chance of double spend success (5% hashrate -&gt; 5% double spend success). To put this in perspective, if 0.5% of the bitcoin hashrate decided to do this it would most likely fuck bcash over completely, because the *whole model* relies on 0-conf being safe. But its fundamentally flawed, and there is no fix for this kind of attack.",1523344533
"Please stop listening to gullible stuff like this. Any soul out there can just get on reddit, enter a sub and state ""opinions"" when in reality they are just parroting. 

The noise is real and I firmly believe that this misinformation will continue to spread. Anyone who don't care about their money will be the only ones making financial decisions based entirely on something someone said on reddit, and they'll never know whether they failed or succeded out of luck or by listening to the right person. If you're smart and care about your money, make a plan for how much you are willing to invest, your minimum worthwhile ROI, and based on that, find what you want to invest in, be it crypto or something more stable. I'll say this again, just in case: make your own decisions, plain and simple. ",1523344532
"Probably the last thing I'd invest in right now to be honest. Platform coins can only succeed with 3rd parties running their projects on said platform.

"There are a lot of people heavily invested at prices at around the time when BCH was $3,000 and won't stop campaigning and selling their brand of coin until at least the price returns to that break-even level. Currently the price of BCH is $634 so we're looking at a 500% increase in price before all of this activity levels off, and a 10,000% increase before it has a chance of overtaking legacy Bitcoin (BTC).

It's a bit like paying a large buy-in to play in a game of poker using your life savings that you can't withdraw from. Sure a lot of people say they only invested what they can afford to lose, but the activity of users here angrily attacking each others coins and calling others trolls on the slightest evidence (e.g. trolldetectr bot and cryptochecker) instead of promoting their own coin says otherwise.",1523344489
I'm still in the green by a longshot so the drop doesn't concern me whatsoever. I managed to allocate a good chunk of crypto to usd to minimize losses at 15k or so.

You seem a bit hurt with CC's.

If you really start looking at each years charts just for bitcoin, you'll see it doesn't really start to pick up again until Sept-Nov. 

I expect it to happen sooner as more and more money enters the economy. 

Sure there's a lot of manipulation going on, but they won't be able to stop it...eventually. 

I'm just here waiting for the best UI, transaction speeds, easier currency conversion.

"Currently, yes, as Cryptos or Bitcoin in special are still in
an growing and volatile state.
This means, if you already have BTC since a long time, its unlikely you made a loss at this time,
except you bought the freaking ""fear of missing out"" frenzy in December.

So if you bought 1 BTC somewhere in the past, below $1000
it isn't that much of a problem, if this 1 BTC allows you to get healthcare (or any other thing) worth $7000 right now.

Bitcoin accepting stores, mostly, see and do this, to offer
an alternate way of payments, just like they do with various
cards or other means of systems at this time.
In that sense, they often don't keep and hold the BTC
but sell them right at the time/worth of the bill you paid for.
It is possible to instantly sell them, to mitigate the risk of volatility.
This allows to ""set"" the price as usual, in your example $200,
to make sure to get and convert back to this $200.


Of course, some merchants do keep their whole BTC-income,
but those are totally aware of potential downsides (and upsides!).
But I don't see anyone to ""set"" prices in BTC in an ""analog"" way (like a Menu card)
in the next years.
But if you view this as is/should be the currency for the Internet,
""fixed"" rates on a stonewall (Brick&amp;Mortar) aren't the main thing to consider,
as onlinestores and Apps don't write their prices on a wall,
but can display and convert the actual price of the product in $ and
show the equivalent price in BTC, in Real-Time.",1523344304

It is unless you believe the Bitcoin infrastructure is worth +100billion USD. Sure we can act like the 10million BTC people have been hodling since  2013 have created more value than what have been lost to transaction fees and middleman fees, but I like to think that the market cap is only what people really would be willing to pay if all BTC was put on sale.
