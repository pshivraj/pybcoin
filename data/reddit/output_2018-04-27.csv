They aren't straight forward about the difference. They are trying to confuse the difference.

The problem is that Bitcoin (BCH) and Bitcoin Core (BTC) don't exist to anyone else outside of r/BTC and  Bitcoin.com. The rest of the world (the average user, every business, every exchange) knows Bitcoin as Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash as Bitcoin Cash (BCH).    It appears that Bitcoin.com is intentionally trying to confused people. Anyone coming to the site intending to buy Bitcoin would be lead to buy Bitcoin (BCH).",1524898788

Trading is the same in a way u have to guesstimate what the market will do...

"/u/Trxth I find your theory interesting.

&gt; My theory: This is a new FUD campaign (just hear me out)...
The current FUD campaign (claiming ""BCH is the real Bitcoin"") is coming to an end. Even if the calls for a class action lawsuit against bitcoin.com's fraudulent nature don't pan out, the community has been vocal enough to put a huge damper on their efforts. But let's remember one very important thing about the ones we know as ""The Others(ub)"": Call them what you may, but they can take a beating 'til they're black &amp; blue, and yet they have always lived to fight another day (albeit with a re-imagined ""face"", and a completely different fighting style).

&gt; My hypothesis: This new campaign is an attempt to make the r/bitcoin community look petty, mean, and immature (and in effect, causing newbies to venture over to the Others(ub) to see what they're all about (a.k.a.- bad publicity is better than no publicity).

&gt; This attempt is sneaky, and I've got to hand it to them: Smart! Not only will they have their own legions of shills to upvote these posts to the Front Page of r/bitcoin; there will also be a vast number of ""true"" r/bitcoin subscribers helping them along just to spite the Others(ub) (and ironically, their/our own face). Think about it: if you were a n00b, ignorant to the reasons behind the BTC vs BCH debacle, and you went over to the BTC side only to see the Front Page filled with these kinds of posts, you'd probably go over to the Others(ub) based solely on the childish &amp; borderline-bullying nature of this shit!

"&gt;I did not mean to imply that you are being deceitful yourself. However, the arguments that you are replicating here most definitely are

I won't suggest that no one with impure/financial motives has ever supported BTC and had deceitful intent in arguing for it, but that doesn't make arguments themselves ""deceitful"", only strong or weak. I'm not just parroting talking points here, I'm expressing what I genuinely believe and have thought through. If I'm mistaken or wrong in my view, it's because of faults in my own capacity, not because I've been ""deceived"". Just wanted to get that out of the way, because I am enjoying this discussion.

&gt;First, there is the false dichotomy that ""the Bitcoin users"" and miners are two independent groups with opposing interests. Miners are users. So are exchanges, cryptocurrency based payment processors, and any services which run on top of Bitcoin.

You're right that they're not separate groups by definition, but being a miner or an exchange runner doesn't automatically make one a ""user"" any more than being a bartender makes someone a user of alcohol. Bartenders and Miners are both absolutely important *stakeholders* of their underlying product; with capital invested in it's future success. Both necessary for it's users to access it safely and reliably and incentiveized to see it increase in popularity, but absolutely *not* perfectly aligned for all other incentives. One can for sure be both, but not by definition. Just because many miners happen to (probably) be significant holders of Bitcoin and are deeply familiar users of it's network today doesn't mean they always will be. I would probably argue that being a holder of the coin should give one a much more substantial say that being a holder of mining equipment as well, but that's a different debate.

&gt;In Bitcoin, validation has no reward because validation alone is useless for the network.

I disagree with this too, and I'll try to illustrate why. I think you're imagining the marginal value of a new non-mining full node, spinning up all by it's lonesome, validating the entire blockchain that's already out there and concluding as thousands of others already had that ""yes indeed, all of these tx/blocks check out"" as having had 0 practical impact on the network, and I would agree with that! But the collective presence of many, many validating nodes in the hands of users as well as miners, exchanges, etc is a massive invaluable *deterrent*.

I'll draw a (somewhat extreme) parallel to nuclear weapons: they haven't actually been used in years, and the marginal value of one additional nuke today is also ~0, but they have a MASSIVE impact on how the world functions today. You just don't notice them until there's very few left or they're really unevenly distributed.

In the event of any staunch disagreement between miners and non-mining validators run by users, the validators win, hands down, because it's *much* easier to replace miners (either by ignoring the ones publishing blocks with rules they reject and accepting the ones that do or in an extreme case with a PoW switch) than it is for miners to replace a network of users....but this isn't true if users in mass cede that control of ruleset and tx validation to groups which don't have their same interests.",1524896878
"&gt; Informative posts that are relevant to Bitcoin

Yes. 

**Bitcoin Cash** is the abbreviation of ""**Bitcoin** - A Peer-To-Peer Electronic **Cash** System"".",1524896783
"&gt; the users decided Bitcoin is the software code hosted at the **bitcon core repository** right now

This is true.

&gt; what the miners decide to mine is irrelevant and that was demonstrated with UASF.

This is contradicted by what you just stated above. UASF was a different repository with different consensus rules from Bitcoin Core (the rules about activation of new consensus rules are themselves consensus rules). UASF constructs and demonstrates exactly an *exception* to the rule that miners don't decide on their own. Normally, users first adopt a soft fork (like BIP141 in Bitcoin Core) and then miners signal for it and activate it. Both users and miners decide. It goes through only if both users and miners agree. This is good. This is how it should be. A UASF does not do what it is claimed to do. Miners practically get full control over what happens to those naive enough to run UASF software, right down to the ability to appropriate the bitcoins which UASF users transfer, in the cases of new transaction output formats such as with SegWit. That's right, the security of bitcoins sent in new ways through a new soft fork absolutely depends on and assumes that the majority of miners *agree* to such new soft fork rules, otherwise the bitcoins can be transferred somewhere else.

This is so, because if a change to the consensus rules is not properly *agreed to*, the old rules are the legitimate ones (in this case, Bitcoin Core rules). This principle holds in law and other fields. It is a really simple social principle.

Users using UASF in effect give up full control to the miners, even if they delude each other that they do exactly the opposite.

Perhaps you meant to say that a good demonstration of the fact that miners are not in full control over the whole system is the failure of the 2x hard fork (which was never adopted by users).",1524896733

As I've seen quoted elsewhere, ""compared to what?""  Bitcoin has a smaller carbon footprint than what the United States Federal Reserve *admits* too and that is just one currency.

Bitcoin also has economic incentive to always seeks the best power/work ratio. Technology is pushed to be more efficient. Fiat doesn't have that since everything can be subsidized due to a monopoly.

&gt;Can any persons opinion be proven?

I'm not sure what you are referencing here but as a general rule of thumb, opinions exist independently of facts. An opinion may be provable or not (in the former it becomes a fact, but opinions can be stated prior to evidence) I don't know what you are getting at though.

"Firstly, Bitcoin Core is not a coin, Bitcoin is the name. And yes, it does have claim to the name, because that’s what it is. Bitcoin (BTC) currently has consensus based on the rules of how consensus works. Therefore it is Bitcoin. The day that BCH has consensus is the day that BCH becomes Bitcoin. Until that day there is one Bitcoin and many Bitcoin altcoins that didn’t achieve consensus. The market has decided which is bitcoin, it’s pretty straightforward really. If BCH was bitcoin, IT WOULD BE BITCOIN.

If you think “Bitcoin Core” (whoever that is) is misleading people, that’s your opinion. But to use that as an excuse as to why it’s okay to sell something that doesn’t work on the BTC blockchain, or that can’t be held in Bitcoin wallets, as Bitcoin, is fucking shameful, and you know it. Stop pretending. 

Bitcoin is not what is defined in the white paper. The white paper represents what bitcoin was released as. Consensus and development has evolved bitcoin into something even better. The people have decided which side of the fork they agree with, so that it what Bitcoin is. That’s how consensus works. BCH already lost. BCH most certainly could become the dominant coin and therefore “Bitcoin”, but right now, today, IT IS NOT BITCOIN no matter how much you shout it or no matter how many bribes Roger makes, or how many social accounts he purchases with the bitcoin name.

"There's a lot of concern that their chosen path, on-chain scaling, will create heavy centralization pressure. When blocks got full, they decided to just make the blocks bigger, and some of the discussions I've seen over in /r/btc suggests that they're willing and even eager to just keep ramping up block size whenever it becomes an issue. This creates centralization pressure because it means more processing power to check that blocks are valid, more bandwidth to send and receive blocks, more storage space to store the entire blockchain, etc.

If your goal is to maximize decentralization to make Bitcoin difficult to control, this is a terrible idea. If your goal is to increase capacity as quickly as possible to handle adoption rates and you don't really care about that centralization pressure, it's a decent idea. Some downplay the centralization pressure this would lead to because of things like hardware costs, but I have *never, not even once* seen someone try to make that argument from the perspective of someone in an impoverished nation.

As described, even with a 'bitcoin' SSID, that device IS a jammer- it is flooding whatever channel it's on with beacon packets (meaning that other users can't fully utilize that channel), and its 60 fake networks will flood the network selection screen on your phone or laptop.  Since it's disrupting the use of WiFi by others, that sounds like jamming to me.  I would encourage you to not use this device until you can figure out how to program it to only put out one network, with a low beacon rate (1/second).  

Also, consider that if people see this as jamming, it will reflect badly on Bitcoin.  That's not the kind of publicity we want.  It makes us appear desperate and sophomoric, like the only way we can get attention is by flooding the airwaves.  ",1524888805

"There are quite a few mistakes and subtle misunderstandings in your comment, believe it or not.

&gt;A soft-fork, by definition, is a fork where certain previously valid transactions are no longer valid.

No, not necessarily. It's a fork where previously valid *consensus rules of any sort* are no longer valid, i.e. when the consensus rules are tightened. There are plenty of per-transaction consensus rules, but there are more consensus rules than just those.

&gt;A soft-fork makes it so that an old client can't send new transactions, but can receive new blocks.

This is totally false. Old clients can continue creating and broadcasting new transactions just fine, even after a successful soft fork activation, provided those transactions are not of a newly-invalidated format or type. In other words, old clients retain the ability to continue transacting after a soft fork occurs, which is the opposite of what you are claiming here.

&gt;Nodes on the new version will drop transactions made by clients on the old version.

This is similarly false. Plenty of pre-0.13.1 nodes still exist (and continue to transact perfectly fine) on the Bitcoin network.

Transactions that fail the isStandard check are dropped (by policy, not strict consensus) by most nodes, but this is independent of forks, be they hard or soft.

&gt;A hard-fork, by definition, is a fork where certain previously invalid transactions become valid.

Again, false. That is not the definition of a hard fork (the actual definition is significantly more general than that). A hard fork requires a broadening/expansion of the consensus ruleset, but this ruleset includes more than just per-transaction validity.

&gt;A hard-fork makes it so that an old client can send transactions, but can't receive new blocks.

Not necessarily, again.

&gt;Nodes on the old version will drop transactions made by clients on the new version.

They will ban and ignore peers that are in violation of their consensus rulesets altogether.

&gt;Quite literally, the only difference between a soft-fork and a hard-fork is whether it's invalid transactions being made valid (hard-fork), or old transactions being made invalid (soft-fork).

Again, imprecise and consequently false.

&gt;If you do both (so that you actually split into two chains), it's generally also called a hard-fork, but it technically isn't, it's both a soft-fork and a hard-fork.

Again, you are confused on definitions here, which is resulting in incorrect (and verging on nonsensical) assertions. There *is* actual meaningful and precise terminology which is used to classify or compare/contrast different types of soft and hard forks, but your explanation here is incorrect as a direct result of your misunderstanding on the respective definitions of ""soft forks"" and ""hard forks""; once you understand that a hard fork is the loosening of consensus rules (such that previously-observed rules are no longer enforced) and a soft fork is a tightening of consensus rules, it becomes clear that any hard fork implementation which also includes the addition of new rules or constraints (which would represent a soft fork if decoupled from the new rule relaxations and implemented in a backwards-compatible way) is just a hard fork, and there's nothing ""soft"" about it. To classify it further (or more precisely) I'd need to hear the specific details of the change(s) in question, but I'm happy to help you with this if you have any examples in mind that are leaving you scratching your head.

&gt;All of those were contentious soft-forks that were upheld through a sybil attack that stopped miners from having their blocks propagated.

Another definitional inaccuracy to finish things off. The rejection of consensus-violating appends to the ledger is not a Sybil attack, just like a 51% attack would not be a Sybil attack. Sybil attacks [*can* be performed to effect certain results in Bitcoin](https.bitcoin.it/wiki/Weaknesses#Sybil_attack), but trying to argue that ""enforcing new soft forks is a type of Sybil attack"" is an abuse of terminology.

It's interesting and disappointing to see someone try to lecture so authoritatively and confidently while being so remarkably mistaken in so many respects.",1524888674

It's also going to depend on how much of a hassle it will be to set up a channel and fund it, vs just scanning a QR code and paying someone.

The big problem we have here is that a bunch of Bitcoin enthusiasts are developing this technology and no one is asking ""How is my grandmother going to pay for her groceries?""  Scanning a QR code and making an on-chain payment is disgustingly easy for anyone.  Install wallet-&gt;Add Bitcoins-&gt;Scan QR code.  It's pretty much a mirror image of Open Bank Account-&gt;Make Deposit-&gt;Use check card to buy groceries.  That's easily understandable by people.

From what I have seen with Lightning, there are more steps involved.

Trying to explain to gandma why there is no route to her grocery store and she'll need to scan a QR code to open a Llightning channel with the grocer and add funds.  But once she does that, she can't use that money for anything else.

And tracking it all will be kind of a pain unless everyone is on Lightning.  Cause you'll be paying some merchants with your Lightning funds, which will be unavailable for on chain transactions unless you close a channel.  And you may not want to close a channel at a time when fees are high.  Plus there is the issue of how much you'll pay in fees per hop on Lightning.  That really has yet to be determined.  Could be miniscule.  Could be outrageous.

However for budgeting purposes it could be pretty cool.  You get paid in BTC.  You have a channel open with everyone you owe money to (cable company, cell phone company, etc.).  You fund the channel as soon as you get paid, but don't send the money yet  Next paycheck you fund it some more till you have enough to make your monthly payment.  Then you live off what's left in your wallet, and send payment when they're due.  As long as fees are low enough, it could be a pretty useful envelope budgeting model.",1524888526

On r/bitcoin that is not the cash.  if you say you love Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin, you will be banned on r/bitcoin.  If you even say you want to increase the block size you will get banned on r/bitcoin.  The same goes for bitcoin.org and BitcoinTalk.

It would be a historical artifact that is no longer in existence. A new iteration would be called Bitcoin 2.0 or something and maybe eventually just fade to being called Bitcoin because there's nothing else competing for that name.

"&gt; Yes, as I described: words' assignation to particular concepts is arbitrary and chosen by social convention. But which concepts actually exist is not chosen in this way. Satoshi discovered a novel concept, and assigned it the name Bitcoin. To then use the same name for something else, like a specific software implementation, is a major mistake that leads to drastic confusions.
&gt; 
&gt; 

Firstly, it's important to note what an absolutely ridiculous logical fallacy it is to appeal to an authority of an open source software project. Satoshi generated the initial whitepaper (which was really a hodgepodge of ideas developed previously by others, including Adam Back [cited]) and was a lead developer for a few years. Is he God because of that? Do ideas not change and evolve?

Beyond that BCash is not a 1:1 implementation of the white paper, so I guess *it* also shouldn't be referred to as Bitcoin.

&gt;""Bitcoin,"" without appendants, should never have been used to refer to its software implementations. Originally, the software implementation was called BitcoinQT. Such differentiations should have been maintained in order to avoid conflation of the design concept with implementations.

Dude, this is ridiculous. Bitcoin refers to the blockchain/network and the rules (i.e. the software) that the miners subscribe to. To think otherwise is grossly erroneous. Read the white paper. What it describes is a continually-mined **blockchain**. I don't know how many times I have to explain it.

BitcoinQT is a reference client released by a leading group of developers, **it is not the consensus rules that dictate valid or invalid blocks**. **You need to understand this**.

&gt;Except that's exactly what people do -- they dictate what words mean by choosing which ones to apply to which concepts, just like Satoshi used Bitcoin to refer to a peer-to-peer digital cash system.... 

Language evolves naturally **AND** the fucking title of the white paper does not represent the contents within. Try reading the other 7 pages.

&gt;Our main problem right now is there has been a huge influx of people into the space since the price run-up without an accompanying increase in education and knowledge about Bitcoin.

Agreed.

&gt; This leads the community to use the term in unhelpful ways, like calling a specific implementation ""Bitcoin"" and trying to claim that any other implementation of the design is ""not real Bitcoin.""

This is retarded. I'm sorry, bro, but you are clueless to what is meant by this term and what consensus PoW means to a blockchain. 

&gt;Most people are largely ignorant of these issues, yes. That's why I'm making posts and arguing these points.

No offense, but you are (willfully?) ignorant of the dynamics at work here. BCH could've been Bitcoin except that the network rejected the fork. Therefore it's no longer Bitcoin, but something else. Sure you could convince everyone to change their naming convention but that'll never happen and even if you could make that happen, why waste the time? Why do you care so much about a fucking name?

This is ridiculous, and as the other poster said it reflects incredibly poorly on BCH that everyone is obsessed with trying to call it Bitcoin. It has to be *the* least important aspect of all. Focus on improving the tech instead of arguing over a word. The tech is was matters and right now BCH tech sucks. It's a centralized shitcoin that is bound for more centralization because big blocks are untenable for a decentralized network.",1524887505

On top of that, BCH is the longest chain among all other Bitcoin versions which are considered cash, hence BCH will be recognize as bitcoin in court, and we can takeover the Bitcoin title on all exchanges if the judge rules BCH as bitcoin.

You know why? The court relies on facts, documents and evidence to come to a judgement, not based on bullshit and lies spewed by neckbeards. Based on the original whitepaper documentation, bitcoin has to be an electronic cash system, and that alone invalidates BTC since it isn't cash when mempool is full and Blockstream themselves claim BTC to be a store of value. Above that, there is no lightening or segwit mentioned in the whitepaper. Only the original investor, Satoshi, can modify the whitepaper, hence the documentation and evidence points to the that BCH is indeed bitcoin, it the closest version to Bitcoin. Bitcoin isn't defined by what you think or what you want, it's clearly documented and defined in the whitepaper, which the court will use as evidence.

Yes, as I described: words' assignation to particular concepts is arbitrary and chosen by social convention. But which concepts actually exist is not chosen in this way. Satoshi discovered a novel concept, and assigned it the name Bitcoin. 

&gt; Bitcoin refers to the software and the network/blockchain. This is how the term is widely used and everyone knows it.

Bitcoin should never have been used to refer to its software. Originally, the software implementation was called BitcoinQT. Such differentiations should have been maintained in order to avoid conflation of the design concept with implementations.

Except that's exactly what people do -- they dictate what words mean by choosing which ones to apply to which concepts, just like Satoshi used Bitcoin to refer to a peer-to-peer digital cash system....

Fair point.  But IMO, the way that it was phrased in the OP makes it sound as though a majority, or at least a large portion, of the community was behind segwit2x.  AFAICT, it was barely anyone in the community, and very much a method being pushed by a small number of companies.

That seems extremely likely to me.

There are definitely a wide variety of people in between, but it does seem as though the wider Bitcoin industry gravitated toward two camps.  One pushing for an immediate, substantial hardforked blocksize increase and opposed to segwit.  The other supporting a more modest blocksize increase through segwit, and being opposed more drastic hard-forked solutions.

"I don't see a problem if banks adopt lightning.

With money in a bank you have no option other than to use the banks services _or_ you have to move your account to another bank. And then you are subject to the new banks rules.

However, with bitcoin you have your own wallet and if you don't like a particular service than all you have to do is stop using that service. But you still own your wallet.

Also, if an LN operator misbehaves in some way it can be replaced with very little resources by a competitor. The only cost is commercial grade server and some BTC to fund the node. A ""hobby"" competitor can do it at home on his desktop and a reliable internet connection.

So, the major difference is that the bank can more or less hold you hostage because your account is in their bank. But that won't work with LN.

So a bank can at best be another LN operator. And they might potentially bring a competitive advantage by their already vast computer networks. But they can't be worse than LN.

For instance, they can create a distributed LN node that uses safe connections between their distributed nodes with a lighter weight network system internally. At no risk to the customer or the vendor, but they can pocket the difference between how much the transaction would be with vanilla LN.

"I think lightning is a great solution.  The risk is only that people with large access to capital get more Bitcoin by running ln nodes.  This is a problem that inherently exists in any monetary system to date.  Really though the administration costs could be significant.  You'd need a team of top info sec guys monitoring the network for attacks since currently the private keys need to be on a device connected to the internet.

The issue I'm talking about has more tondo with the network topology.  SPV isn't a transaction type.  It's a method of validating transactions by asking a lot of nodes what they think.  It's a lot of back and forth.  This is why we have JavaScript a client side language so we can run operations locally rather than doing a round trip to the server.  It dramatically improves user experience and cuts down on bandwidth.  Not to mention the issues wireless networks have with filtering noise.  Many small packets carry with them more overhead and likelihood of failure.  This needs to be balanced with the larger packets failing less often but having to send more data when it does happen.  

I'm not sure but I believe that SPV requires TCP where much of the block propagation enhancements use UDP which is lighter weight than TCP.

It's eager loading vs. lazy loading.  I think eager loading would be better on a satellite network in a disaster situation.",1524881949

"**Linux kernel**

The Linux kernel is an open-source monolithic Unix-like computer operating system kernel. The Linux family of operating systems is based on this kernel and deployed on both traditional computer systems such as personal computers and servers, usually in the form of Linux distributions, and on various embedded devices such as routers, wireless access points, PBXes, set-top boxes, FTA receivers, smart TVs, PVRs, and NAS appliances. The Android operating system for tablet computers, smartphones, and smartwatches uses services provided by the Linux kernel to implement its functionality. While the adoption on desktop computers is low, Linux-based operating systems dominate nearly every other segment of computing, from mobile devices to mainframes.

"&gt;This is unfortunate, and is owed to two things: (1) The Bitcoin Core implementation of Bitcoin has for too long been called simply ""Bitcoin,"" with the result of widespread confusion, and (2) The change in the nature of the BTC chain away from fundamentals of Bitcoin is still not widely understood. **It will take some time for a detailed understanding of the fork, its causes, and its consequences to make its way into the market and the public.**

Doesn't matter. We're talking about consensus and contiguous blocks here. If you think we're talking about white papers, Satoshi's vision or anything else, you are completely confused as to what a decentralized blockchain is.

&gt;No. Ver isn't trying to confuse people, he's simply speaking of Bitcoin in the design sense, and hasn't yet come out with a full explanation for why Bitcoin Core should not be called Bitcoin. He has alluded to such things, but never spelled it out very plainly, perhaps because he's more of a businessman and marketer than academic.

You're as bad as him if you believe that. Selling people ""Bitcoin"" when it's actually Bitcoin Cash is fraud. Once again we're referring to entries on a blockchain not design parameters. 

&gt;And each distribution is or can be implemented differently. They're as much different implementations as different distributions.

It's clear that you don't understand what Linux is. Linux is a set of operating systems based on a single open source kernel project, called [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel). Any forks of the Linux Kernel are referred to by something else. See [here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/G2Xri.png) for examples of various Unix projects. Notice how they aren't all referred to as Unix or Linux. These are each different projects and referred to as such by **different names**.

&gt;No. That's like saying that if we can get everyone to agree, then Calculus no longer exists, and we can call algebra calculus, because everyone agrees, right? Consensus in language usage is fine for determining which symbols/names go with which concepts, but not for eliminating concepts altogether, or for conflating two concepts into one nonsense one. Bitcoin is a socioeconomic design, an idea with particular features, and this doesn't change no matter how many people try and say otherwise. Consensus matters in other ways, and within the context of different Bitcoin implementations, especially with regard to routine changes or upgrades which do not fundamentally alter the design. But it does not determine what Bitcoin is.

You are complete naive about how blockchains work, my friend. I don't have the hours and days required to get you up to speed, sorry. Hint: there's a clue in the 'chain' part of the word.

&gt;There is nothing more ""centralized"" than a monopoly on software implementation which is used to force both Segwit and block size caps onto the network regardless of its lack of support from the network itself (miners). BTC is centralized at the development and political decision making level, and those in control make every effort to maintain their power, from banning dissenters from debate forums to spamming social media.

Utter nonsense. Nobody controls Bitcoin except mining consensus. There's no conspiracy or centralizing force at play here. Miners vote, that's all.

&gt;Nope, you're wrong here. Sorry. Words and concepts are different things. Bitcoin is a novel concept, a new, particular design within the domains of socioeconomics and mathematics. You can call something else Bitcoin (like BTC, which now does not resemble this design in many crucial aspects) all you like, but that doesn't change this fact.

Lol. Just stop. You're embarrassing yourself. Words develop meaning through colloquial use and adoption, not because you dictate what they're supposed to mean. Bitcoin refers to the software *and* the network/blockchain. This is how the term is widely used and everyone knows it. If you want to switch the term to mean the BCH implementation then you have *a lot* of work to do to convince people that this is what the term means because currently it doesn't meant that in the slightest.

The current FUD campaign (claiming ""BCH is the real Bitcoin"") is coming to an end. Even if the calls for a class action lawsuit against bitcoin.com's fraudulent nature doesn't pan out, the community has been vocal enough to put a huge damper on their efforts. But let's remember one very important thing about the ones we know as ""The Others(ub)"": Call them what you may, but they can take a beating 'til they're black &amp; blue, and yet they have always lived to fight another day (albeit with a re-imagined ""face"", and a completely different fighting style). 
     
My hypothesis: This new campaign is an attempt to make the r/bitcoin community look like mean, childish bullies (and in effect, causing newbies to venture over to the Others(ub) to see what they're all about (a.k.a.- bad publicity is better than no publicity). 
     
This attempt is sneaky, and I've got to hand it to them: *Smart*! Not only will they have their own legions of shills to upvote these posts to the Front Page of r/bitcoin; there will also be a vast number of ""true"" r/bitcoin subscribers helping them along just to spite the Others(ub) (and ironically, their/our own face). Think about it: if you were a n00b, ignorant to the reasons behind the BTC vs BCH debacle, and you went over to the BTC side only to see the Front Page filled with these kinds of posts, you'd probably go over to the Others(ub) based *solely* on the childish &amp; borderline-bullying nature of this shit!        
    
Why do **We** need to be wasting our time &amp; effort with that *fucking obvious* shitcoin? **We** have Segwit, LN, and much more tech that's just around the corner! **We** have *the best of the best* developers working on the protocol. We have a 9+ year track record and a **$7.5-Billion** market cap! And most importantly, *We* don't have to worry about our project failing as a result of anything other than the tech.     
     
Let me remind all of those misguided r/bitcoin subscribers that are still upvoting this shit: We/You do not need to stoop to the level of insults &amp; smearing. Bitcoin can stand *just fine* on its own two feet. Do you see any other ""coin"" out there that's trying to do the same thing that We are?

If you understand the technology and its ramifications, then there is no need to spend another minute thinking about the Others(ub). They can have 80% market share for all I care; it will never change the fact that their ""technology"" is at best a cheap knock-off, and at worst a fraud.",1524881083

This is unfortunate, and is owed to two things: (1) The Bitcoin Core implementation of Bitcoin has for too long been called simply ""Bitcoin,"" with the result of widespread confusion, and (2) The change in the nature of the BTC chain *away* from fundamentals of Bitcoin is still not widely understood. It will take some time for a detailed understanding of the fork, its causes, and its consequences to make its way into the market and the public.

No. Ver isn't trying to confuse people, he's simply speaking of Bitcoin in the design sense, and hasn't yet come out with a full explanation for why Bitcoin Core should not be called Bitcoin. 

&gt; There aren't multiple linux implementations, there are multiple distributions, which go by different names.

And each distribution is or can be implemented differently. They're as much different implementations as different distributions.

&gt;  Consensus is consensus, bro.

No. That's like saying that if we can get everyone to agree, then Calculus no longer exists, and we can call algebra calculus, because everyone agrees, right? Consensus in language usage is fine for determining which symbols/names go with which concepts, but not for eliminating concepts altogether, or for conflating two concepts into one nonsense one. Bitcoin is a socioeconomic design, an idea with particular features, and this doesn't change no matter how many people try and say otherwise. Consensus matters in other ways, and within the context of different Bitcoin implementations, especially with regard to routine changes or upgrades which do not fundamentally alter the design. But it does not determine what Bitcoin is.

&gt; BCashers altered the design by promoting centralization. T

There is nothing more ""centralized"" than a monopoly on software implementation which is used to force both Segwit and block size caps onto the network regardless of its lack of support from the network itself (miners). BTC is centralized at the development and political decision making level, and those in control make every effort to maintain their power, from banning dissenters from debate forums to spamming social media.

&gt; Words are not defined in the way that you're implying and Bitcoin most definitely refers to the chain and consensus rules, not the white paper. Derp

Nope, you're wrong here. Sorry. Words and concepts are different things. Bitcoin is a novel concept, a new, particular design within the domains of socioeconomics and mathematics.

"Craig Wright said he thinks it would be great if banks and government ran Bitcoin.

Roger Ver said his reason for Bitcoin Cash is that we only get one chance to gain adoption and we can always change the system.

I deeply disagree with him here.  There are plenty of examples of products being introduced as flops and the next version or following versions gained mass adoption.  One notable example is Android.

If we gain mass adoption on a platform that can be centralized it will be very difficult for us to change to a decentralized system. Look how hard it was to soft fork segwit.  Right now Bitcoin is very small with mostly somewhat technical people in it.  When it gains real mainstream adoption and government and billions of people rely on it.  Changes will be very difficult and far more dangerous.  

I think it's prudent that we hold off pushing adoption until Bitcoin is more bulletproof no pun intended. 

I also question running large blocks over slow networks like TOR which I believe is a card we need to hold on to for the purpose of being nation state hard.

Also I think it is important for us to be able to run over satellite particularly for natural disasters like we saw in Puerto Rico.  We can't really rely on Bitcoin if it isn't easy to it up in an area with limited access to electricity.  You could do SPV clients but the bandwidth is really small so if too many people try to use it.  I think it would be better just to broadcast transactions and download new blocks then validate locally.  Both for security and functionality.  I think too many SPV requests could clog the satellite pipe like cell phone networks during an emergency.",1524879137

As for as consensus goes: we can say that so far Bitcoin won consensus. That doesn't mean Bitcoin Cash can't grow to become bigger than Bitcoin, but it definitely means that according to consensus rules (part of the original vision Roger loves to use an excuse) it's simply not the real Bitcoin right now.

As far as my framing goes: what was so poor? I was fine with a disagreement on what direction to take. It gives us some healthy debate on what solution works better. But it's Roger that is obsessed with the name, hence I broight it up. Why else would he go as far and hide the real name of Bitcoin Cash? If it was just about the tech/direction, he wouldn't need the name, but could instead promote Bitcoin Cash as it is. Yet he decided it was better to hijack the name and trick people into buying something other than they ordered. That's simply scamming people and I simply can't aprove of it. This isn't about Bitcoin Cash believing in a different scaling solution, it's all about hijacking an existing brand, most likely because his ego is preventing him from accepting opposing views.

I really wish it was just about a disagreement on direction. It's definitely what started it all. But with actions like these, Roger is no longer fooling me. He simply wants the Bitcoin name. Why else does he focus so much energy into this when he said himself people are dying right now because Bitcoin isn't using a proper scaling solution?

"It could go way back if the maker wanted to tell the whole story.  It was April 2013 when ideological Andreas went on his [tirade](https://bitcointalk.to/index.php?topic=181168.msg1977971#msg1977971).   I would guess that was around the time when peoples' politics were being made clear.  Bitcoin had been on a long bull run.  Then price of Bitcoin had been back and forth around $100 for a while, it started climbing in October then rocketed thru November until Gox in December.  That price spike triggered a lot of attention including from Big Fiat.  More obvious moves started happening after that.  I would like to see a timeline showing a LOT of important events and making the whole sequence clear, I think that would be most convincing.  Of course like the removal and exit of key persons.  Also things like the github repo transfer, mods becoming political, censorship and the banning of users from discussion, trolling of discussion forums even by key players, important BIPs, the ""soft fork"" and the BCH fork, the offloading of trolling onto professionals, the new fee market and the reduced dominance of BTC.",1524878482

"Well, I bought a few coins in May of 2011 for an inaccessible online poker account with a few hundred dollars in it. BTC was trading around $15 a coin at the time. I forgot about them. I was also given about 8 bucks worth, .01693881 btc to be exact, in 2005. I found them back in February after the crash. I've sold and rebought some since then.

Overall, I guess about $18,800 if I cashed it all out now. So, I guess I've made about $18,400 over 7 years. Although, I probably just lost $400 while typing this. ",1524878410

"They don't. [Even terabyte blocks wouldn't](https://youtu.be/PKFkhWWiLDk).

It's solely due to Core's mistaken belief that the validation network is made of miners + non-miners, and that non-mining clients matter for validation of blocks. They think this because they misread Section 8 of the whitepaper and therefore fail to realize that SPV is maximally secure. 

The only validators are miners, thus the only thing that needs to be decentralized in the Bitcoin network proper is hashpower. And the very best way - in fact the only possible way - to do that is to get more miners to enter the space. They only do that if the price increases, which can only happen if utility of Bitcoin increases, which requires scaling up massively. ",1524878284
"Exposure is exposure. The margin is simply how much money you use to open the trade.  So in your example you have either $50 000 or $20 000 to trade. $10 000 x 5 leverage or $10 000 x 2 leverage. 

How much of that you use determines your profits or losses. The temptation is always to put down a bigger position, so you only have $10k of your own funds, but you can put down $25k on a position and incur profits and losses of the $25k position, not the $10k you have. 

You have to be extremely careful with margin on Crypto's. These things lose up to 50&amp;#37; or gain up to 100&amp;#37; in a few hours. So lets say you chose to go 5:1 and put down $25 000 on a short and Bitcoin doubles. You'll lose your account and then some. 

The correct use of margin is actually to reduce broker or third party exposure. So instead of depositing $10 000 with your broker, you only deposit $2000. But with the margin you still have $10 000 to trade. That way if the broker folds you still have money left. Or if your position gets into trouble you can bail yourself out. 

Hope that helps and made it a bit clearer. ",1524878250

"Well you need to use the blockchain if the other person manages to hack or fake a transaction, or to open and close a channel. Bitcoin secures it. 

You should try using LN. Seriously, download a wallet, tap ""channels&gt;Connect to random"" and it maps out the best person to connect to. 

Then send 1 Satoshi to someone via QR code. 

Also, you will need to use the blockchain if you want to send any sons to someone who does not have a lightning wallet. If I use LN, but someone doesn't accept LN, you can just pay the fee. 

Eventually, almost all transactions will be on lightning and therefore transaction fees will be low to do on chain. Just like you shouldn't accept 0-Conf for $10,000 transactions, you shouldn't use LN for $10,000 transactions, because if the other person breaks in your home and shuts down your wallet, deletes the backup, then brute forces your private key, they only need to solve the block once within 144 blocks, not compete with the network. So if they were to knock your computer offline for a full day and guarantee that you won't come online, then they could steal all funds in the channel you have with them. Of course, if you come online for 2 seconds within that time, you take all of their money. 

It is secured to the same way. Bitcoin is. I'm making it so expensive to try that it's not worth it.

1/10,000 might succeed, but that means that the other person had to lose all of their money and their wallet 10,000 times in order to steal the funds in your Channel with them just once.

In comparison, someone might be able to double spend a transaction once in 10,000 times, but it's just not worth the effort because by the time they succeed, they wasted a ton of electricity mining, which actually cost more than they'd ever hope to gain. Cause in theory, the 4 richest people in the world on Bitcoin, or the richest 1 person in the world on BCH, could just buy hashing power and destroy both networks out of spite, and destroy trust, etc. But they'd spend about 450 times more than they'd ever ever hope to ever gain, and on top of that, they'd have made more money just mining for the network.

"It can't replace the blockchain because it needs a trusted central ledger. Credit Cards have Visa, PayPal has the company, etc. But Lightning needs a centralized, trusted entity to settle disputes. If I manage to catch you offline and submit an old channel states, your wallet will either sign the transaction if it wants to agree, or dispute it. The ""theif"" then loses all his money, because this ""central ledger"" solves disputes. Ever heard of Game Theory? 

Well this ""centralized trusted company"" is Bitcoin blockchain. We can trust that it will respond in a predictable manner. We know that it will not accept spent outputs, for example. 

It relies on Blockchain for security. 



Here is the thing: With any kind of payment system, you get to choose a balance of 3 things: Security, speed, and centralization. 
The more security you get, the less speed and more you must trust them. With Bitcoin, there is no trust, so you need to balance 2 things: Speed/capacity, and security. We can reduce the block time to 1 minute, but we increase orphaned chains. We can reduce the proof of work required, but it reduces security. 

The whole point of 2 separate layers, is that we can allow Bitcoin to be slow with confirmation times, and it doesn't matter. Bitcoin has great security, but if we wanted to compete with Visa at the current moment, each block would be 13gb of data average. That's 13gb you must upload and downlod every 10 minutes! 

The solution is to build a lightning fast miceopayment system that can't function on it's own, but trades ""trust"" for ""speed"". Like PayPal, Lightning network has a single centralized entity to solve disputes and to manage channels. This is what makes it so fast, cheap, and secure, by introducing a single controlling entity. 

But guess whst this entity is? Is it a company, like a bank? Nope! This central entity is the blockchain. The blockchain is the core of the security of LN. It's called a ""2nd layer"" because the whole point is that it is cheap because there is no proof of work! The reason why Bitcoin transactions cost is because electricity cost. With no proof of work on the layer 2 for LN, transactions are 1 Satoshi. Of course, the blockchain functions the same as it's always functioned. 

Essentially, LN is a network that is centralized to Bitcoin. 

The only way to have LN without using Bitcoin for it's trusted secure controlling mechanism is to control it by proof of work, which just makes a special kind of blockchain all over again. 

Just like you can't make a PayPal system without a central company (to prevent me from changing some numbers and stealing or inventing money), you can't make Lightning without a central secure ""decision maker/company"", which is the blockchain. 

Bitcoin Cash currently has FlexTrans, which removed the 4x efficiency boost and LN support (Time lock hash contracts and smart contracts was removed). But if BCH currently got Segwit, it would mean the 8mb blocks instead are 32mb (they do actually take more power to hash since the blocks actually are bigger, not just compressed) but the chain only needs to save the 8mb each. This means you can get 4x the size with no downsides, and then get LN implamented for microtransactions. Like sending one single Satoshi to someone. It's not worth it now, but I sent 1 Satoshi to someone for only a 0.3 Satoshi fee. And it confirmed in about 1 second. 

A micropayment channel layer was talked about by Satoshi, and Lightning is only one of the solutions. This is like saying ""Wireless communications"", which can be Bluetooth, wifi, etc. So there are other ways to implement it, obviously, and the current LN is different than proposed on testnet, but the reality is, if you want to handle 100,000 transactions per second, to compete with Visa, the block size is going to be larger than 1gb, which means it's not feasible, because only the top 2% of internet speeds can even run a node, and only large fast computers can verify the hashes needed, meaning only huge companies will afford the server-class computers. For now, while Bitcoin is small and hardly used, it could work, but long term, LN or another payment channels network is the only way to compete with Visa. ",1524877269

"&gt; What does this even mean? Core does not achieve consensus. Bitcoin has consensus, and Core develops software that fits **within** that consensus.  

Core is a single repository controlled primarily by a single person, but significantly influenced by a very small group.

"I did not mean to imply that you are being deceitful yourself. However, the arguments that you are replicating here most definitely are. They are the same technically unsound arguments that have been used over the last three years to ostracize certain parts of the Bitcoin community. Dirty politics, not science.

I'll do my best to point them out to you.

First, there is the false dichotomy that ""the Bitcoin users"" and miners are two independent groups with opposing interests. Miners *are* users. So are exchanges, cryptocurrency based payment processors, and any services which run on top of Bitcoin. In reality, miners are usually some of the biggest holders of Bitcoin, and are substantially invested in Bitcoin mining equipment. So they are some of those who stand to lose the most if the rules were broken (like issuing extra coins) and trust in the system disappeared. This is specifically how Bitcoin was designed to work. Singling out a specific subset of users like the miners and creating an ""us vs them"" mentality is a way of exerting power over them, devised by people who have a significantly smaller stake on the network.

Second, ""a broad decentralized network of validators"" was never part of Bitcoin's design, and has no impact whatsoever in the day to day operation of the network. In Bitcoin, validation has no reward because validation alone is useless for the network. Validation is only useful if you are going to use the up-to-date state of the blockchain for anything meaningful, like producing new blocks or running a service. The idea that, at some point in the future, miners will be able to change the rules and nobody - not even the other businesses depending on the blockchain - will even be able to notice this has no reasonable logical foundation or supporting evidence. For the foreseeable future, there will continue to be a broad range of users and businesses (miners or otherwise), with diametrically opposed interests, which will be able to afford running both BTC and BCH nodes.",1524873838
"I agree! Originally I was hoping Ethereum would fix all the issues with Bitcoin, but as Ethereum progressed and promised lots of things and failed to even deliver a testnet for PoS and sharding, I'm thinking Bitcoin truly is the future. But it's all speculation at this point. Lightning network looks promising.",1524873777

"Check out this Reddit post and you might understand more about the history. https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6r4no6/its_called_bitcoin_cash_the_term_bcash_is_a/

Long story short, it all started when Bitcoin Core supporters knew that there was a split coming. They quickly try to associate Bitcoin Cash as ""Bcash"" and snap up all the forums/sites/subreddits/etc and deceive Bitcoin Cash users into those places these same hostile admin controlled. Because they controlled these places, they can ban users and only allow negative information to be submitted and read by the new users.

We consider this extremely unethical, immoral and downright hostile and lowlife tricks. And then you can understand why we're trying to stand our ground. And more than that, personally I feel that Bitcoin Cash is an important invention and it's one of those things that can truly change the world for generations to come. Right now, bad actors are using the financial system to suppress and harm citizens around the world (eg. Venezuela). And for those countless generations depending on us winning this battle, you might understand why we simply cannot afford to lose. There is simply too much at stake.

The problem is a fascinating one. It all began in 2014 when Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn, both in love with the idea of bigger block sizes, had a falling out with the rest of the bitcoin dev community. Roger was invested in Gavin at the foundation, perhaps elsewhere too if I remember correctly. Despite Roger being an anarchist and Gavin being a statist, Roger accepted Gavin's views on scaling at face value, and took their side when the devs started fighting over scaling.

All of this is only possible because Roger misunderstands one key point in Austrian Economic theory, which he loves to quote wrong. In Menger's regression theorem, which is what Austrians point to as the explanation for how money comes to exist, Roger thinks it says that Money has to be a transactional network first before it can be a store of value... Which is exactly backwards. Read it for yourself: (second to last paragraph)

https://mises.org/library/origin-money-and-its-value

Sadly, no one has been able to rub roger's nose in this fact; his mind is too invested now in the opposite being true. He squirms out of it and simply shouts the opposite over his debate partners every time it's brought up. 

If he could only accept this point he'd know that Bitcoin's property of being a store of value (digital gold, settlement layer) is far more important than it being just another paypal competitor. The first one is what Devs have been protecting all the while knowing that the latter can be lost and refound... The store of value will be lost forever once gone.

The question will be whether the action actually caused damages and whether 75% of the jury thinks the damaged people should be compensated.  Personally I think selling ""Bitcoin core"" and ""Bitcoin Cash"" is fine, but calling BCH ""Bitcoin"" is definitely confusing to new people.  The price should tip them off, but remember that new people might not know the price of each and the price history.  They might think ""I guess it dropped... It does that"" or think they are buying half a coin.  It just takes one person to be hoestly confused into buying the coin he didn't mean to buy.  It goes the other way too.  Say I believe ""Bitcoin"" is a bubble and ""the other Bitcoin"" is going to win, but I cannot remember ""BCH"".   I could buy BTC confused, thinking ""Bitcoin core"" is the ""other Bitcoin"".  It's just better to use standardized terms.  In fact, both protocol have documented names.  (Neither ""bcash"" nor ""Bitcoin core"" is on the list of official names.)

"Why are you so angry because I posted 38 deals (just dropped links) in a deals subreddit over the span of 5-6 months (&amp; 5-6 months ago), which makes 6 deals per month or one every 5 days on average? Is that proof of me being a shill? And that CSW is paying me ""to shill""? You need to work on your logic. And the fact that you will dig 6 months deep in my history just because I expose your lies whenever I can, shows how credible you are. 

For the newcomer, this post is part of an exchange where Contrarian &amp; his team of trolls take lies CSW said 2 years ago when he was forced to come out as Satoshi against his will ""to prove"" that he is a fraud and a liar. Whenever I can I expose their defamatory comments by saying that their entire argument relies on lies he said to protect his own privacy to prove that he is ""a fraud"". They attempt to chit chat once with points like ""but why did he lie about a blog post to Wired"" (I remind contrarian that CSW answered him directly and said the blog post was meant to throw wired. Basically because Wired was writing a piece on him without permission, and he knew that asking them to not publish it wouldnt work. So when they reached out he gave them a fake post instead to invalidate the entire article). 

Another thing they say is ""but he also got paid by nTrust to come out as satoshi"" - which is also a lie, he was never paid to come out as satoshi but he sold satoshi's life rights to nTrust without any commitment as to when to come out. 

Next, and I know these by heart because I have had this discussion with these trolls thousands of times, they say but why did he lie to Gavin. This is also false, to this day Gavin has a blog post where he says he believes [CSW is satoshi] (http://gavinandresen.ninja/satoshi). Quote from the blog post:

&gt;[..] But even before I witnessed the keys signed and **then verified on a clean computer that could not have been tampered with**, I was reasonably certain Inwas sitting next to the Father of Bitcoin.

Gavin never retracted this. CSW was pushed to provide public proof that he was Satoshi subsequently and released a pair of fake pgp keys. For Contrarian &amp; Co this is proof that he is not Satoshi and that Gavin was bamboozled. They back this up with a subsequent interview where Gavin says ""it's certainly possible I was bamboozled but I don't think so"".

Now as they run out of arguments, Contrarian and co attack me personal. This long ad hom post basically amounts to

""but you posted some links in deals 6 months ago so you are a shill paid by CSW"".

Typical troll strategy to deflect the conversation to another unrelated topic. I'd be a shill if I was lying, or trying to mislead people. One cannot be a shill for exposing false narratives.

Bandwidth also becomes an issue when blocks become too big. Imagine a similar scenario to the one above, in which Bitcoin had 10 GB block and therefore grew by 10 GB every 10 minutes.  Now imagine that you are someone who, for whatever reason, wants to spin up a full node on your 3.5 MB/s connection. The first thing your node must do is download the entire blockchain. At 3.5 MB/s you suddenly realize the blockchain is actually growing faster than you can download it...

Sure, your logic here is totally sound.  But unfortunately we're talking about the definitions of words, and in that situation the views of the masses outweigh any logic we come up with in our own private corner.  Words are used to communicate, and the masses have decided a definition of the word that we don't like.  Changing the definition of this word will be exceedingly hard, and will probably conflict with the larger and more important goal - working on BCH's success as an ecosystem.

&gt; they've managed to attract market interest that would be wholly unreachable otherwise.

FYI, I do believe based on my analysis that, despite everything, there really is a lot of people who fundamentally believe and agree with Core, above and beyond the censorship, the confused newbies, and the illogical shills.  There are a number of people who I have had discussions with where we simply could not agree on the most fundamental points - They felt that the ability to run a full node and do self verification out of a home was far far more important than any economic adoption that was missed.  Alex Morcos comes to mind as one such person, and I respect Alex after discussing things with him.  Despite the fact that 97% of Core's supporters are morons and/or highly confused / uninformed, there are a few that are informed and do understand the tradeoffs and sacrifices they are proposing, and they truly believe that is correct.  And there's more of those than you might think, even amongst investors / market interest.",1524871315

But as Heart describes, you're going to create two communities, and both are going to fight for control with power and influence, with both saying they're the real bitcoin... Honestly, people just have to be smart about this. The whole reason we needed crypto in the first place is we can't trust humans in power, we have to trust a system, I feel that's why Satoshi wanted to stay anonymous and why he's disappeared.

Again, this was my concern, and was fixed on Testnet a while back. 

You will only need to do 2 transactions in your ENTIRE LIFE!

One to open the channel, do every transaction you ever need to do for free/near free, off-chain, or send money to standard on-chain address via 1 transaction, and then 1 transaction to close.

You only pay 2 fees for a lifetime of transactions. I opened one channel for only $4, and have left it open for about 3 months so far, doing all transactions, send and receive, on and off chain, within that channel. 

Funds are no longer ""Locked"" into the channels. What is, however, is a timeout for security. 

If we both have 5BTC, but I try and steal 1BTC from you, the blockchain detects this, and gives YOU ALL 10 BTC, but you have to wait 144 blocks (~1 day) before you get to keep the scammers money.

You can not steal LN funds unless you manage to both brute-force the hash of the closing transaction, AND double-spend the transaction. Which is just as hard as brute forcing someone's private key and then double-spending it.
So no, just no.

Crypto is trustless. And the safest wallet to secure your funds is with a hardware wallet, like the Ledger Nano S.

In the future, people may carry around hardware wallets with smaller amounts on them, like you might currently do in a physical cash wallet.

Does it matter for the automobile industry if tgis year Toyota is #1 or GM? ",1524870058
"&gt;It was wrong for UASF to do it, and it's wrong to do it now.

Agreed. I'm fine with people leveraging that reasoning as a reductio ad absurdum of Luke's position though. 

&gt;There's only so much we can do to help people who don't do their due diligence. Claiming to be the real bitcoin simply gives ammunition to the already very weak ""Ver is a fraud"" claims. Bitcoin censors don't need any more ammunition.

I really think what Core has turned Bitcoin into should not be called Bitcoin. Can you imagine if Core tried to ICO what their trying to turn Bitcoin into? ""Bitcoin - A Congested-by-design High Fee Settlement Layer"" would have had a very hard time taking off in the current market. By hijacking an extent project and surreptitiously transforming it from Satoshi's low-fee P2P cash into another animal altogether they've managed to attract market interest that would be wholly unreachable otherwise. 

The name means *everything* to Core because their ideas fundamentally would not have legs without it.

All that said I get that it is what most people consider Bitcoin, by hook or by crook, and we should respect that I suppose. I don't really like what Roger's doing calling BCH Bitcoin and BTC Bitcoin Core, because I think it's stooping to Core's level. ",1524870047
"&gt;  How does SegWit ""break the chain of digital signatures""??

It doesn't. You can find [articles](https://www.coindesk.com/the-risks-of-bitcoins-segregated-witness-problems-under-us-contract-law/) which claim that segwit makes more space by discarding signatures, but this is simply untrue--archiving nodes continue to store all transaction data, signature or otherwise, provided they support segwit (which [almost all do](http://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/services.html)). The most obvious way you can see this is just to look at blocks--if signatures are discarded, why do we get blocks that are larger than the previous limit of 1MB? The answer that they aren't discarded.

*The caveat to this is that segwit has a feature of being able to strip witness data from transactions and blocks if desired by the receiver. The primary use of this was to remain compatible with old nodes that don't understand segwit, but could also be used with, say, light wallets, which might want to know about transactions, but don't generally care about the signatures of most transactions aside from the ones directly affecting their balance, though still care about transactions not inflating the coin supply (tx data without signatures is enough to check against inflation). At this point I don't think there are many nodes/wallets that use this feature though.",1524870032

Let people disagree and let them freely think. We shouldn't force anyone to like BTC, like BCH, hate BTC or hate BCH. We should focus more on providing facts, evidence and reasoning.

- BCash: BCash is an hostile attempt to takeover Bitcoin.

- CSW: CSW is Faketoshi and is a fraudster.

- Bitmain: Bitmain supports big blocks because of ASICBoost

- Roger Ver: Roger Ver is a criminal and a felon, he even raged at an interview. Why would I trust him with my money?

All of these arguments have failed as they aren't valid.

"Yeah, one would think. I think the story is that these inefficiencies are there because developing reliable software for handling all these coins is a slow moving process. New forks with new quirks come faster than the exchanges can respond with their threadbare engineering talent.

Another element is that there isn't a lot of supply liquidity from airdropped coins to come on to the market. There are whales with 10s of thousands of coins, but the incentive is to not be messing with their cold storage until the trustworthy tools to extract the forked coins get more mature \- another bottleneck of software engineering talent. If popular wallets add support for Fork X, you would think that the price of Fork X drops due to the new supply. In that process, the traders and value buyers get their hands on more coins. I would hypothesize that the traders and value buyers are better sources of trading liquidity than the long term BTC hodler that just wants to cash in their 'free money' from the fork.

As liquidity improves the arbitrage opportunity would temper. The data is there for you to go look but I would say that liquidity is just barely coming online for coins below the top 5\-10 ranked fork coins we track at forkdrop. Perhaps that means good arbitrage opportunities for peoples with bots that move quickly, but I am no expert on these topics.",1524869264

No, you should read the history.  Both sides attempted to hijack ""Bitcoin"" here.

There's no one left to push for bigger blocks, so it won't happen.  Similarly, BCH forked off, and they forked off at an especially bad time when businesses and miners that would normally support bigger blocks could not do so because of s2x.

Roger's claim is essentially that Bitcoin Cash is a more authentic realization of the original Bitcoin white paper. That isn't a transaction that can be confirmed or rejected. There is no governing body with the authority to overrule it. The miners have some control over what is allowed to happen on the chain that they're mining, but they can't somehow make it an objective fact that their chain is the one and only ""real"" Bitcoin blockchain.

None of that matters at the end of the day. What matters is that the Bitcoin Core blockchain is much more *popular* than the Bitcoin Cash blockchain, therefore all of the exchanges call it Bitcoin and give it the BTC ticker. No amount of hash power could've prevented them from treating Bitcoin Cash as a straightforward upgrade if they had wanted to do so. Sticking with Bitcoin Core was a business decision informed by popular demand, not the result of some formal democratic process.

It actually is; A bubble is just any market of an asset where the value vastly exceeds the intrinsic value, i.e., _the value that is backed by current use._

What my comment is getting at is the fact that _every single cryptocurrency_'s valuation, when split in ""intrinsic value"" and ""speculative value"", the former is vastly outnumbered by the latter.

Bitcoin mining requires a MASSIVE amount of processing power and is pointless if you have a single PC, but if you can use thousands or hundreds of thousands of PCs networked together you can potentially make real money mining bitcoin. That's what these malware developers are trying to accomplish.

Bitcoin mining won't damage your PC per se... it means the cpu and/or gpu will be working much harder at times (probably during idle, like you read). This produces heat, makes fans work harder and can lower your PC's life expectancy... but honestly it'll barely do anything in that regard. You might take a performance hit, but again it's probably only doing it during idle.

The one real, definitive issue with this is power usage. Mining increases the power used by your PC dramatically, and will cost much more money in electricity than it can possibly earn... this is why they're using YOUR pc instead of their own ;)

It's clear to me that the software behind Bitcoin Cash has the best implementations of Bitcoin. What's to decide?,1524866567
"Without adding to much technical detail, if there is a transaction (for example between you and person B) you need the confirmation of this transaction, that's basically what's mining does, it's checking if all the transactions that are being made are correct (for example if there is no double spending going on)

So basically mining is a progress that keeps the system going, so it's not bad in any way if you have crypto. Miners even earn BTC (or other coins) for participating computing power to the system. It's sometimes also refered as PoW 'proof of work'. 
As you need special software for this, you don't need to protect your pc from it
There are more aspects to mining, but I don't want to make it too complicated. 

In your case, it's hard to tell if the program is mining in the background, but the only way to prevent this is to not use it and change to another provider ",1524866566

FFS. it's saying an overhaul and restructuring of the power central banking authorities have had on the human race for pretty much all of history, is a more meaningful development than what we achieved with Internet connectivity alone.

"&gt; When it failed to materialize, he should have immediately gotten behind BCH.

This is the folly of BCH forking 3 months BEFORE segwit2x failed.  BCH became a joke amongst the moderates and the Core supporters; Because it barely had any momentum - far less than it has today - it wasn't taken seriously by any businesses and most miners.  Coinbase, run by longtime bigblockers, said they wouldn't support it at all or allow it for trade.  Even Jihan said he wouldn't mine it until after others started.  Jihan also states that it is not Bitcoin.

When you fork too early while many of your potential supporters are still supporting a different alternative, you create problems.  BCHers were warned of this and ignored it.  They have their reasons for doing that, which I don't agree with, but the reality remains the same, and that's how we got here today.

&gt; Can you define this term for me? I have opinions about it but I'm curious what you think.

A mainnet proven ability to keep fees at a low amount under high transaction loads and while still processing transaction confirmations in a timely fashion.

Core had the chance to do this and utterly failed in December, along with multiple failures before December.  I believe BCH's bigger blocks will perform fine, but it hasn't been real-world tested other than with Ethereum - Which is quite a bit different due to its faster blocktimes.  Ethereum choked a bit but did clear through and recover much smoother than Core.  That was also Ethereum's first real test whereas it was Core's 5th or 7th or so.  I eagerly await the real world test of BCH's capacity.

&gt; Why do you think this?

[This graph.  To overcome BTC's total work lead](https://imgur.com/3HOu86t), BCH's line must cross the BTC line that it is way, way behind.  This is driven by miner payouts, which is driven by price whenever reward amounts are equal.  BTC's price has been ~6-10x higher for ~9 months now.  To simply catch up, BCH's price would need to be 10x higher for about 7-10 months.  But at this point, simply reaching price parity with BTC would be huge news, nevermind being 10x higher.",1524865805

It's backwards compatible. That's literally all that matters. Let's say Bitcoin Core doesn't even exist, and I secretly invent SegWit on my own.

Yes and no, BU BTC nodes would follow the Bitcoin in the bitcoin white paper. They would not reject a block that was 1.1MB unless the majority hashpower rejected it, that's just a BS/Core distinction. 

Coincidentally as soon as BU had 45-50% of the network hashrate, the DCG proposed S2X and miners stopped running BU switched to support S2X the agreement that had ""universal industry support!"" 

Segwit had 27-33% of the hashrate at the time. 

Worth noting 50% supported moving away from Core, 33% supported Core, and 27% had not committed either way. The DCG invited Core and the ambivalent miners to the S2X negotiations. 
Barry Silbert also personally thanked Adam Back publicly for his assistance in negotiating the agreement. BU was not invited despite being the developers behind the majority of hashrate. Core refused to attend I can only guess it was planned by Adam Back, and that way Core could act independently of the agreement when it came time to block the 2X part. ",1524865385
"&gt;If less supply of an asset is available compared to demand, then the price will go up and hence the market cap.

This is just a general trend and in no way a rule of any sort. 

Think back to when bitcoin first started. You had all these people mining but nobody using it or selling it. Then, when people started to actually sell it, what if the first bitcoin ever sold was sold for $10k? Suddenly the market cap is in the billions but only $10k was spent?

Point is, you just can’t compare the market cap to real-world assets. Any comparison is too abstract to be useful. So to say that crypto market cap can’t be $40t becasue that’s more than the GDP or the US is just plain wrong. It’s not a “real” value. $40t worth of bitcoin doesn’t actually exist. It is simply the supply times the last price. You can do analysis of current trends to determine what it might take to get to $40t but that’s about it. ",1524865383

People may choose to disagree with the definitions of Satoshi, in which case I guess they feel they are superior; I personally do not think I have the breadth of vision to do so with any confidence and hence the guidance of Satoshi over what Bitcoin is should be discarded with the __utmost caution__.

"Tips:

If you go for it, trade with a small percentage of your btc stack.

Swing trade in a range with pairs after watching the swing range for a bit, be patient during flat times and don't go chasing trades outside the range you've observed.

If you gamble on ICOs or new small market cap coins just remember that investment carries a lot of risk, i would diversify and use very small portions of portfolio.  I did very well investing in ICOs during 2017 but most of my investments went nowhere and were made up for by a couple winners, I just got lucky I made some good picks that easily wiped out any losses on my other trades.

If you like the technicals on certain alts and that drives you're decision to buy them, buy and hold long term, short term price doesn't correlate well to a coins technology.  Something you think is awesome with a great concept, team and execution may keep a low value for a long time while hyped up white papers crush it price wise in the short term.

I was agreeing with you. I was just noting that this part of the protocol helps the nodes that are running mutually compatible implementations of the software decide which blocks to mine on top of. Since BCH and BTC are running incompatible implementations, whichever chain is longer/has more PoW is an irrelevant argument at a software level.

"""consensus via the market"" does not exists, it isn't defined anywhere, it isn't useful for anything in any PoW based cryptocurrency. All a currency needs is a marketcap high enough that every attempt to rewrite its history will always be unprofitable.

""consensus via mining power"", as clearly defined in the whitepaper, it's a process which chain to continue between 2 **valid** chains, it has nothing to do with (nor it is even mentioned) deciding which chain is valid between 2 chains with 2 different implementations and 2 different rulesets. Both Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash have 100% consensus in their own respective chain, that's by design and true for every cryptocurrency.

centralization in ""supply and holdings"" has never been a problem, and Satoshi always had more holdings than bitmain since the beginning; for the supply part is even a straight up lie since in Bitcoin Cash the cumulative hashpower of independent miners surpasses every single mining pool. Bitcoin Cash scaling solution allows to monitor the hashrate distribution and stop increasing the blocksize if it ever starts causing centralization. Bitcoin Core instead has no control over the topology of their second layer, which also has strong economic incentives to become centralized.

My point was not to decide which is ""teh real Bitcoin(tm)"". My point was to show which community sticks to the fundamentals that gave Bitcoin value and which community doesn't mind even if Bitcoin becomes Banking System 2.0, as long as it keeps the ""brand"" Bitcoin(tm)",1524864657

"Yes, and public non-mining ""nodes"" are not a reliable metric for decentralization whatsover. The only decentralization worthy of the name is decentralization of **power**, and non-mining clients have zero power over the system. 

The decentralization that matters is mining decentralization, development decentralization, and arguably holder decentralization. BCH is superior on dev decentralization, and would be superior on all three after a flippening. Also, any PoW system is more robust than any non-PoW system as they have opaque attack surfaces for one thing, and also every alternative so far fails to incentivize the formation of the hyper-robust all-to-all configuration of the validation network like BCH and BTC do (though Segwit weakens that slightly in theory).",1524864481

He makes at lease 10 of these buys in every session, then disappears. At first I thought it was perhaps a malfunctioning bot that I could skim off, but when I made a huge sell order around the price it buys for, a few hours later when I checked back, it just made the buys at a slightly lower price. I am 99% positive it is selling to itself- but why? If he wasnt selling to himself, he would literally be throwing away 2-3btc every day. What does anybody have to gain for spoofing volume?

This is in contrast to ""the current consensus implementation"" which seems to be what you are mischaracterising him as referencing. Obviously, you break consensus as defined in the code whenever you make a breaking change... but it _is_ possible to execute certain hfs in a manner which preserves the legitimacy of the rough consensus implemented in said code. However, BCash has not done this, and thus, is not consistent with consensus: can never be Bitcoin-- this was Theymos's point.",1524864128

No it's not. Bitcoin is NOT a democracy. People can create their own altcoin if they don't like the current consensus rules of Bitcoin. You can hard fork all you want, but if there is no wide consensus that the fork is necessary the fork can never be Bitcoin. Ever heard of tyranny of the majority? That's what's going to happen if a small majority can decide on new rules, and it would completely destroy the trust people have in the code and immutability of the blockchain. This is why a hard fork requires pretty much the entire ecosystem to agree, not just a small majority.

"The phenomenon of markets for forked coins might be an interesting place to study. Upon the creation of the fork, the cold storage of the exchanges gets credited and in theory those coins belong to the users. Exchanges seem to do one of three things:

1\) nothing, ignore it and/or deny the existence of the fork and/or FUD its legitimacy. These exchanges are busy and this is less effort, so I can see why they do this.

2\) credit the users and support the coin for deposit and withdrawal creating an efficient market, should trading liquidity and arbitrage opportunities with other exchanges doing the same open up

3\) Credit the users, **however,** do not open up for deposits and withdrawal and just trade** trapped coin**s.

The result is that between #2 and #3 there are **two markets for the same coin**, one somewhat efficient condiment on liquidity, and one that is not at all efficient. Looking at the price differences between exchanges, this often appears as a huge arbitrage opportunity, but looking closer, it is not because one exchange has coins trapped.

Also, the KYC/AML premium is real for these coins. People bought their BTC anonymously, but want their extra value from the forks and don't want to correlate their identity with the blockchain records. This category of user **will sell for less** on an exchanges where they don't have to give up their name, **creating arbitrage opportunities** for those that can straddle KYC and non\-KYC exchanges trading the same coins.

But when you fork off, call it bitcoin cash, change the difficulty algo to not die a fast death, wait months and months with no sign of ""flippening"" no one serious is going to view it as bitcoin no matter what happens.

A whole other question is what if bitcoin decides to change mining algo? Then hashrates are incommensurable and you can't use that argument at all. Then how do you decide? Must bitcoin always be SHA256?",1524863763

"Yes, but I also think Nakamoto consensus was only intended to (and only naturally does) apply to the short term block-by-block vote. It's a fantastic mechanism wherein a Keynesian beauty contest is utilized to guard against any minority meddling by rogue miners, governments, or just plain miner error. 

For instance, it eliminates the need for a blocksize limit in a professionalized mining industry (the failsafe while it was still needed for flood control was just that, a failsafe) because no miners will mine atop an enormously oversized block that they expect other miners to reject, which in turn they reject because it would displease the market and stakeholders in general.

However, Nakamoto consensus doesn't seem a suitable tool for determining the ""winner"" where there is a genuinely *adamant and persistent* split among the stakeholders. For that, the long-term market process makes most sense (""the market short term is a popularity contest, but long term it is a weighing machine, assessing actual value""), and that brings us full circle to a point where the most-work chain is again Bitcoin.",1524863443
"&gt; I doubt most average humans have enough experience with computers to go through all the correct steps of securing their crypto. 

Dude I have to deal with people every day who can't even remember where they left their debit card or PIN. This person would lose all their cryptocurrency almost instantaneously by virtue of simply losing their key. Baby boomers still fall for the ""your computer Apple has 67 battery virus call Microsoft to pay for virus remove"" emails. It would be super easy to prey on these folks and fleece millions from them a day. This would also exponentially increase the number of homeless and desperate people because there's no way to get that money back. If they send $500 worth of Bitcoin to a scammer, oh well you learned a valuable lesson SFYL. If they give their debit card number to a scammer who then charges $500 on their card, no big deal here's some paperwork to get your money back. 

There was a thread in a cryptocurrency subreddit a while back that stated this guy wrote down two private keys for two wallets he gave to his family with $500 each of cryptocurrency in them. He made an Excel file of the private keys, then *engraved the keys into metal* (lmao I'm sure everyone has an engraver at home so they can keep their key safe) then forgot to delete the original file. Malware got onto his computer and then the wallets were emptied. SFYL, too bad so sad.

Yes, we can both agree here, that is a more reasonable statement.

There are other coins that I feel are worth holding onto because they are relatively new/undiscovered and haven't been hyped. Once these coins get hyped I re-evaluate to see what kind of developmental progress has been made, where the roadmap goes, how the team responds to the attention. There are some coins that I sell because the hype train starts to override the developmental milestones. Coins like VEN or TRX that have become massive hype machines were sold long ago for me. PRL has received a lot of attention and hype, but I feel the team has kept it under control and not letting it get in the way of development.

"&gt; You just close your eyes and say ""lalala"" when I point out to you that by your own agreement miners already don't have the same consensus rules

The BCH miners apparently don't, because the developers are incompetent and cannot even understand why they need to reach a consensus on the block size limit.

The BTC miners, as well as the miners of most other altcoins, **do** have consensus on the validity rules.  (Although the consensus was briefly broken when BIP66 was activated, leading to the ""Fork of July"" incident.)

You are aware, I hope, of the difference between the block validity rules -- also awkwardly called ""consensus rules"" -- of a coin, and all other policies and algorithms that may be embodied in an implementation of the same?  

The block reward amount and the max block size, for example, are validity rules, and therefore all miners must agree on them.  

The RBF policy, the minimum transaction fee, and the forwarding of client transactions are not validity rules, and therefore each miner can do whatever damn he pleases about them.

&gt; Miners do not have to agree on block size.

**YES, THEY MUST AGREE ON THE MAX BLOCK SIZE**.  It is not a philosophical question. Satoshi explained why in 2010; and, in fact, that is precisely the reason why he put the explicit 1 MB limit in his code. I have explained it many times, to the BCH devs and to you.  Sorry, I don't know how I could be more clear.  

I understand that the BCH devs **don't want** to understand, because each has his own idea of how the limit should be set, views that idea as his ticket to fame, and cannot contemplate the thought of having to discard his code and adopt someone else's.

But why do **you** refuse to understand?  Are you one of them?",1524862909

Long story short, it all started when Bitcoin Core supporters knew that there was a split coming. They quickly try to associate Bitcoin Cash as ""Bcash"" and snap up all the forums/sites/subreddits/etc and deceive Bitcoin Cash users into those places these same hostile admin controlled. Because they controlled these places, they can ban users and only allow negative information to be submitted and read by the new users.

We consider this extremely unethical, immoral and downright hostile and lowlife tricks. And then you can understand why we're trying to stand our ground. And more than that, personally I feel that Bitcoin Cash is an important invention and it's one of those things that can truly change the world for generations to come. Right now, bad actors are using the financial system to suppress and harm citizens around the world (eg. Venezuela). And for those countless generations depending on us winning this battle, you might understand why we simply cannot afford to lose. There is simply too much at stake.

You can't just change the definitions of words that the majority of people agree upon because you don't like it.  That's not how language works.  There are objective definitions that demonstrate that Bitcoin Core is Bitcoin - total proof of work and market cap.  Even disregarding that, there are simply many more people that agree that BTC is Bitcoin, not BCH.

There's nothing wrong with BCH accepting the mantle that it is a minority fork and it must work to overcome the failures that lead to the fork in the first place so it can become the dominant coin.  But that won't make it Bitcoin - words don't just change definitions from year to year willy nilly, and the definition is pretty set in stone by now.

The same was shown with the split of ethereum and ethereum classic. Ethereum got to keep the name only because the majority voted for the fork. 
Bitcoin seems to have no definition. It seems to be a word that describes a cryptographic decentralized payment network. Like most other coins.

"Tl;Dr: domain squatting and lack of consumer protection laws are an issue, plus I'm old and no one in  traditional financial management is available to help me navigate arouns the scams.

For the short term, two things:

(1) domain squatting, have ICANN at least consider if ""Bitcoin.com"" is free riding off the reputation of ""Bitcoin"" where the site is focused on Bitcoin cash; and,

(2) Regulate coins via consumer fraud laws.

 Have a ""nutrition list"" type requirement for all coins shown on regulated exchanges. Like orange soda -- it's orange in color only, maybe 1% orange juice and no vitamin c.

For coins, show how much ""Bitcoin"" is in them (sorry I'm not technical.) Or show how many forks away from some original block chain. 

And the number, the number mined, the half-ening dates, etc.

The point is that most consumers are going to go to a regulated exchange, at least for the short term. Have all coins traded, and derivatives, required to have this ""nutrition label"" . 

The regulatory agency could be the California state department that regulates consumer fraud. Or the Federal Trade Commission.

This is different from financial regulators, like the OCC, CFTC, SEC, etc. Those agencies want to know about *buyers.* The know your customer regulations are the thing. Who has money and where is it going.

This is a know-your-seller *customer protection*.  The idea is to get consumers protected.  Protect ordinary consumers from fraud. 

A complaint: I'm  older and female and am having a hard time navigating this.

 I have financial managers and estate planners, and a large social group, and no one takes this seriously.

 I've tried to find help to get more involved with crypto. I've been told that the wealth managers aren't allowed to recommend crypto as a fiduciary, and for estate planning it's just another asset and could be taxed or not. So even though I'd like to do some financial management with crypto, I don't have the confidence to know what's what. 

My adult child's significant other is a crypto trader, but this person seems focussed on Iota one week, and Vechain the next, because of the technology, not as a value proposition. 

So having this Bitcoin cash and other scamm-ish nonsense is a real barrier to entry, at least for me.

"&gt; Bitcoin Cash has a longer chain (number of blocks), but only because their blocks are easier to mine (due to lower difficulty)

That's a misconception.

Regardless of the hash rate applied, the Bitcoin consensus rules will always retarget the difficulty after the current 2016 blocks period to match a 10min average block time. 

If you have 2 chains using the same rules, one with 1Mh/s and with 2Mh/s, you can expect to always roughly have the same block height, even the difficulty of the first chain is half that of the second. Again, the difficulty rule aims for a constant block period, so a weaker chain cannot just run away.

The reason BCH is some 7k blocks ahead of BTC is because BCH changed its difficulty rule to drop by 25% if the block median time grows above 12h. This is a dangerous practice that jeopardizes BCH and has been openly exploited by miners to rake in extra coinbase profit. It also increases the surface of Bitcoin mining attacks, but I digress.

BCH changed its difficulty rule from the Bitcoin consensus one, therefor it is disingenuous to compare chain length or even accumulated work for that matter between BCH and Bitcoin. If your basis to decide which chain is Bitcoin comes down to the accumulated work from the genesis block, then you have to realize BCH is ineligible.

Are you dense? Segwit was activated with 90+% miner support, plus segwit didn't cause a split. People who were not satisfied with segwit activation led to a split! Its the same idiotic argument as me eating oatmeal for breakfast causes chain splits lol. Leave it, its a waste of time discussing.

&gt; Well last time some tried to increase the block size by the smaller increments (2MB)they have been violently attacked (after segwit activated obviously.. click-n-bait)

Who was attacked? Jameson Lopp? I certainly remember someone tried to swat him and get him and his family killed, resulting in gems such as this posted here and gaining upvotes: https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/76s938/jameson_lopp_on_twitter_dear_anonymous_coward_who/dogn6i1/

&gt; No the white say that difficulty algo much keep emission stable, which it does a better job at.

You have no clue how the system works. Sure, the its to keep emission and blocktime stable, but it serves a much more important use also: killing off forks with no concensus so we don't end up with a lot of shitcoins.

&gt; Please elaborate.

The incentives as originally outlined was that miners have the biggest stake in the system, so they would of course run code that benefit the network, as they make most money that way. That incentive has been removed with the bcash DAA as it ensures all chains are viable - if miners don't want to mine the new fork, fine, it will still work without them and get hashpower if its economically viable.

It doesn't matter if one chain has 1/10th the hashpower, both chains will be equally functional and miners are left with only a choice to mine based on price.

This is also how bitcoin works to a certain extent (however relying on miners to activate softforks *actually* is more in line with the original vision).

&gt; BTC give much more power to miner than BCH.

Absolutely! Difference here is that bitcoin proponents actually don't like it that way, but thats how the system was designed. BCH broke from that design.

&gt; That’s an extraordinary claim, please elaborate.

As I said, blocks will be generated regardless of miner support. All coders need to do is get important nodes to run the software. Its basically down to having a guy with good connections to go out and get exchanges to run your code.

&gt; This apply to any blockchain... sigh...

Actually not to bitcoin. If bitcoin is starved of 90%+ of the hashpower it will take months with almost no blocks at 1 mb to adjust difficulty down a little. This was the whole point if segwit2x - miners thought they could starve the chain of blocks and force the update, but it was too contentious: segwit1x had still 20% hashpower and most exchanges were going to list segwit2x separately, and even the futures market showed little economic support. However, had more exchanges and less mining power been on board segwit2x then had been a reality... well apart from the software crashing at forktime minus 1 blocks because of shitty code garzik wrote lol (what a disaster that would have been btw).

&gt; If someone fork it can change the difficulty target and generate block without changing the BTC DAA exactly the same..

Exactly, you can do that. You actually *must* do that, because as an small shitcoin with the same mining algo you're bitcoins bitch that would get ruined with the same DAA.

&gt; Neither did satoshi.

I think he'd be pretty horrified to come back and not be able to run a node himself.

&gt; The everybody need to verify is a rather new thing.

which makes your earlier ""oh so concerned"" comment about ancient nodes having to rely on SPV security. But its nice to see that you agree that SPV and a full node is not equal in security at least - you might want to make a post about it here on this sub to see how thats recieved lol

&gt; Small blocksize is no guarantee of security.

Never said that either

&gt; I agree but that would be another project.

No, not if there is concensus to change it.

&gt; No you need a reference to a currency, the white paper is.
&gt;If there is no reference and all its characteristics are free to change anytime possible then the currency cannot retain long term value.

You are wrong. No its characteristics are not free to change anytime - changes can only be made with concensus.This is why bcash cannot retain long term value - it has no stability, hardforking left and right, with or without miner concensus.

Keep on reading the whitepaper as your gospel, I don't really care, so there no need to discuss this any longer

&gt; I have no love for centrally planned/ponzi currency.

oh sweet summer child, you think bcash is not centrally planned lol :) To fork all that needs to happen is for deadalnix to phone up Ver telling him theres a patch, and he should get exchanges to install it.

"Sorry but you are confusing decentralization with p2p. If Jihan was the only miner and never censored txs is bitcoin still p2p? Yes. And if Jihan decided to censor by leaving txs dangling in the mempool he would incentivize new entrants into the market because anyone with the resources can mine. 

The block size is basically orthogonal to the proof-of-work, and the proof-of-work is distributed in the sense that anyone can do it. There is nothing stopping any entity from doing the proof-of-work if they have the resources and capabilities. So this idea that there will be one company that is the only one doing Bitcoin doesn't really make sense if it's cost competitive for other companies to be involved. Yet the boogeyman of centralization is repeated in censored forums. It misunderstands the bitcoin’s central economic conceit: it’s the greed of the miners that makes bitcoin work.

End users can still validate transactions via SPV, which is completely valid and provable without storing the entire block chain. Consensus relay nodes can do the same thing, although they will start dropping off the network when the bandwidth costs become prohibitive. So in a small block system we have an extremely limited amount of space for transactions, which means the cost will eventually be excessively high and result in settlement between big players. That's the choke point that allows for KYC and AML. You can submit a transaction to the network, but you can't afford to because there isn't enough bandwidth to service your request so you are forced into regulated channels, onto exchanges, or through third party choke points that can be audited. 

People who want small blocks for Bitcoin really need to be thinking about using an altcoin, it was never in the plans to have an extremely low bandwidth pipe to keep things decentralized when the proof-of-work is by default a centralizing force. Centralized  BUT p2p. 

To the contrary LN is NOT p2p. It bottlenecked into hubs from the moment it was born and that will only get worse.

"Sounds like by ""extreme"" he meant well beyond Visa levels in 2009. It's nine years later, we should be able to do multiples of Visa levels if ""Bitcoin can already scale much larger than [15 million Internet purchases per day worldwide] with existing hardware [in 2009] for a fraction of the cost. [of Visa.]

Here's another email on the subject:

&gt;&gt;The final number I'm interested in is the 500kb limit on block sizes.
According to Wikipedia, Visa alone processed 62 billion transactions
in 2009. Dividing through we get an average of 2000 transactions per
second, so peak rate is probably around double that at 4000
transactions/sec. With a ten minute block target, at peak a block
might need to contain 2.4 million transactions, which just won't fit
into 500kb. Is this 500kb a temporary limitation that will be slowly
removed over time from the official client or something more
fundamental?

&gt;A higher limit can be phased in once we have actual use closer to the limit and make sure it's working OK.

&gt;Eventually when we have client-only implementations, the block chain size won't matter much.  Until then, while all users still have to download the entire block chain to start, it's nice if we can keep it down to a reasonable size.

&gt;With very high transaction volume, network nodes would consolidate and there would be more pooled mining and GPU farms, and users would run client-only.  With dev work on optimising and parallelising, it can keep scaling up.

&gt;Whatever the current capacity of the software is, it automatically grows at the rate of Moore's Law, about 60% per year.

http://plan99.net/~mike/satoshi-emails/thread3.html

So 2.4 Million transactions per block was certainly fine in 2009 in Satoshi's eyes. That would be about 1 Gigabyte blocks, 9 years ago. Add in even half of the 60% per year that he said, and with 30% per year increases we should be able to handle 8 GB blocks today, and 0.5 Terabyte blocks in 16 years.

BCH's chain might get to an extremely large size without something like SegWit to compact the blocks.  
BTC's chain is barely usable right now, and it might become usable again when people adopt SegWit. Because it was a softfork people don't have to adopt it though - which is why I say that a hardfork is better, as it forces everyone to adopt the upgrade.

I use BCH not because of any ideological reasons, but simply because it *works* here and now. This might change in the future, which is why I still hold more BTC than BCH.

Your video compression example is what I'd use to describe SegWit - the data is (mostly) intact but it consumes much less space.

"&gt; There is ZERO proof of this.

There is TONS of proof of this. [This](http://bitfury.com/content/5-white-papers-research/block-size-1.1.1.pdf) is perhaps the oldest paper on the subject. Just look at the computation requirements to run larger nodes - Not surprisingly, they increase. If the hardware requirements increase, they also become more expensive. If they are more expensive, fewer people will run full nodes. Hence reduced decentralization.

Another paper, very recent, can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03998). One of the conclusions by the authors, big BCH supporters, is that if we were happy with the level of decentralization for Bitcoin in 2016, then in 2017 we should allow for a block size increase of up to 1.7x. This is an implicit way to say that larger blocks increase the centralization, all else being the same. So in 2017, after tech improved, we could have increased block size by 1.7x and retained the same level of decentralization. It's kinda ironic because SegWit gives you approximately a 1.7x block size increase!

Even this sub acknowledges that huge blocks will require huge mining operations and server farms to run. If that's not centralization for you, what is?

1. RBF is NOT a security hole. One, it's opt-in... you don't like it, you don't use it. Two, if you do use it, it simply forces the merchant to wait for a confirmation, which should be good practice anyway because 0-conf **is not safe**. You don't believe me? [This website](https://doublespend.cash/) tracks the double spend attempts on Bitcoin Cash. There's many successful ones.

2. There's people on both sides of the debate who don't understand the tech they support. And you might just look like a ""BCH Parrot"".. if nothing else, because you are parroting ""Core parrots"". Just for clarity, Bitcoin Core is software, not a coin. And nobody is supporting a specific piece of software. Instead, people are supporting Bitcoin. If you really want to refer to them as parrots, you should call them ""Bitcoin parrots"". Else should one call Bitcoin Cash Bitcoin ABC instead?

3. So first high fees are a problem... but then when they are lower, it's a problem too? Fees are not ""artificially lower"" anymore than Bitcoin itself is ""artificial"". It has all been designed by humans, and so is not ""natural"". And miners are making quite a lot of money as is... they certainly don't need to raise fees to get their worth back. Besides, some are doing just that, refusing to mine txs with less than 10sat/b fee. And because we can stuff more txs in the same block, it's not really clear that they are making less per block. Less per txs, OK, but not really less per block. Put it differently, miners will not leave the Bitcoin chain because ""SegWit fees are too low"".

"Why do I hear ""Added/removed 0-conf"" a lot?

0-conf transactions are not secure on an RBF transaction, but that is it. RBF is an optional feature, and when broadcasting the transaction, you can either choose to broadcast RBF flag or not. Nobody uses RBF currently. CPFP doesn't affect the merchant either.

0-conf transactions are exactly as secure on both BCH and BTC. Actually, arguably more secure on BTC simply because there are many more nodes. And the reason why it's secure on BCH is because it doesn't have RBF transactions, and nodes won't hold 2 transactions in the mempool that use the same UTXO's. Guess what? Bitcoin doesn't either! Bitcoin nodes won't accept or broadcast a transaction if it sees another one first using the same UTXO. This makes 0-conf just as secure on both chains, as long as the transaction broadcasted isn't an RBF transaction (Which can be seen). As a merchant? ""We accept 0conf for non-RBF Legacy and Segwit, but we require 2 confirmations for an RBF transaction.""

Simple enough. RBF transactions are rare anyway, and most wallets don't even let you send an RBF. If you send a non-RBF transaction, it's impossible to use RBF on it unless it's set before hand (Also changing the hash).


TL;DR: In reality, zero-confirmation transactions are either secure on both chains, or insecure on both.

Ok, lets say fees on bitcoin are ~10 dollars on average.

Now, lets say that fees on bcash are at 5 cents on average.  If you put in a fee of 10 cents, then your transaction will almost certainly confirm within the next 10 minutes.

This is because blocks on bcash are not full.

&gt;""Safe mode can still be triggered by seeing a longer (greater total PoW) invalid block chain.""

&gt;Clearly, Satoshi says here that even though a chain with more total hashpower may exist, it can still be invalid. This is in direct contradiction with the fabricated lie of S2X and its ilk being that the blockchain having the greater total hashpower would be Bitcoin.

I might point out that these remarks from satoshi are over 1 year *after* the whitepaper release, meaning they are more well formed concepts that satoshi had time to think through after a year of bitcoin existing. This quote right here demonstrates that satoshi thought there could be instances in which there was a ""higher accumulation of proof of work"" on an **invalid** chain.

Clearly his opinion on the subject was evolving, and would have continued to evolve had he been around. Its pointless to speculate ""what would he think now"", because one ....satoshi is not god, and two, he decided to leave, and pandering to a fasle prophet serves no one.

Clarification is in order: Miners are **rational, selfish agents**, in the sense that they try to maximise their own profit. Like every other business out there. This is neither ""evil"" nor ""good"". But it must be take that into account when designing the system! 

For example, every industrial sector businesses will merge to make more money. If you can fire people after a merger and retain the same profits from both entities, you just increased the return. Miners will act in the same way - If merging (aka centralizing) operations leads to larger profits, miners will do it.

We had a large amount of developers that outright stated that if S2X became bitcoin, then they would have lost interest in developing towards the project. That would have left the talent pool behind, leading to a few rookies taking over the codebase, leading to developer centralization which is just as bad as mining centralization.

I just paid a thousand dollars for 1 bitcoin core. I feel so stupid that I got scammed like this.,1524857299
"Firstly, be careful of being scammed.

The buyer may ask you to transfer the domain first.  Domain transfers are not reversible,  so you want to ensure you have payment from the buyer secured first.

If the buyer trusts you, then there's no issue.  You provide your bitcoin address, wait for one confirmation (or whatever number of confirmations you two agreed to use as for determining ""settled""), and you transfer the domain.  Easy peasy. 

Otherwise, things get a little more complicated. 
  
Bitcoins can easily held by an escrow partner.  Domain names generally not so much, especially with restrictions on how soon a domain can be transferred a second time (e.g., [ICANN allows a registrar to refuse a transfer request](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/name-holder-faqs-2017-10-10-en) simply because the domain had been transferred within the past 60 days) -- making the domain be stuck with the escrow partner for that period of time.

What makes it even more difficult is that [without whois information published anymore](https://www.icann.org/news/blog/data-protection-and-privacy-update-seeking-community-feedback-on-proposed-compliance-models) (for .com domains), there is no proof that the transfer to the buyer occurred --  giving: 
1.) the seller the ability to fraudulently claim that a transfer to buyer occurred when that was not true, and 
2.) giving the buyer the ability to fraudulently claim that no transfer occurred when the seller truly did make the transfer as claimed.

I believe account-to-account transfers do not have this restriction.  So, for example, if your domain is registered with GoDaddy.  You can transfer ownership of the domain to another GoDaddy user, knowing only their account number (or e-mail address used with that GoDaddy account). 
You get e-mail receipts of the transfer as evidence that the transfer occurred. 

What you can do though is to do this account-to-account transfer to an escrow partner's registrar account (e.g., if you, and the escrow partner are both using GoDaddy).  Then the buyer pays you.  The escrow partner sees that payment complete (with N confirmations), and then transfers the domain to the buyer.

There are a number of places to find an escrow partner.    BitRated, [BitcoinTalk](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2439910.0), and more.

There are a number of ways to do this without an escrow partner even.
Perhaps a multisig tansaction where you have a trusted partner/arbitrator getting one of the keys, and after seeing the buyer sends the multisig payment, you then do the domain transfer using screen sharing that you record.  If the buyer will not spend the multisig (which pays you), then you share the video with the arbitrator who then would use that third key to spend that multisig transaction (and thus you get paid).  Of course, even live screen cast videos can be faked, so this might not be a 100% safe method for a $100K domain, but likely fine for a $500 sale.",1524857299

At this point you can't rely on accumulated PoW to decide which coin is following the design, because other properties have been violated in the process.

This is the same principle as if a large miner took over the network and you wanted to protect Bitcoin from that miners influence by forking away from it.

"Well there are three parameters in that definition: following the rules of the protocol, having the longest chain by block height, having the most accumulated proof of work. The parameters referring to longest chain and most proof of work assume that the chain is following the rules of the protocol. Since bitcoin cash hard forked and no longer follows the protocol of the chain it forked from if you were to strictly follow that definition it could never technically be Bitcoin.

I think that practically speaking it is possible that the main Bitcoin chain could lose the support of an obvious majority of the Bitcoin community (miners, businesses, users, developers, etc.), lose most of it's value, it's hash rate, usage, development support, etc. and the community as a whole could choose to switch all that support to BCH.

There *should* be a 2nd line showing the BTC population number that is different than the non-BTC number.

If hashpower decided that bitcoin is shit, that doesn't make shit bitcoin. Bitcoin has a definition. It's defined by the very paper you're trying to use to argue a point that you've obviously misinterpreted.

As you can see two sentences before the last one, nodes can rejoin the network and rely on the longest chain as proof of what happened while they were gone. It doesn't say that the purpose of it is to change bitcoin's very definition. It's meant to allow a user to *most likely* rely on the longest chain, since it will likely be the one following the rules. Let's say 51% of miners decided to break the rules... is that chain now bitcoin because more hashpower followed it? No it doesn't.

Since the majority of hashpower followed a chain that is no longer bitcoin, it falls to the next chain that is enforcing the actual rules of making bitcoin bitcoin. It's not a be-all-end all. If 90% of miners make bitcoin into something it's not, it's not bitcoin. Plain and simple.",1524854438

"If you have an intellectual curiosity about alternative ""proof of"" protocols, we are working on this right now.

There are two reasons for choosing a next block validator by proof of work.  First, there is the Satoshi ideal of randomly distributing that rewarded right on an equal participation basis.  This is what the move to GPUs and now ASICs has tended to defeat, by concentrating hashing power in fewer collective hands.  A number of coin projects have intervened by unilaterally changing their hashing formulas, thereby instantly bricking ASICs dedicated to a previous and now obsolete protocol.  Bitcoin could do the same thing if the governance will could be assembled to do that, which existing ASIC miners would certainly oppose.

The second factor, and perhaps the most important from the standpoint of system security, is the concept of making it practically impossible to rewrite the blockchain history by requiring duplication of the same amount of work that went into validating the blockchain as it is.  To the extent that proof of stake does not require the same massive amount of computational work, this particular theoretical benefit is absent.  We suppose that if some centralized authority is tracking who the block validators were supposed to be, that would be more like a traditional banking system that says, ""I'm the central server, and I say what the history is.""

Your question, if I understand it correctly, suggests that you are looking for some alternative protocol still founded in computational work (""cycles"")  But we believe it is technically possible to create blocks of ledger data in a blockchain that cannot be tampered with, without requiring either proof or work or a centralized referee, for anyone who is interested in staying tuned.

You should realize that while you hold that opinion, many of these coins are created by teams from top universities, supported by the biggest players in the cryptocurrency space, and offer unique use cases which are different from just store of value/ease of transaction.  

I recognize bitcoin as the defacto store of value and unit of transfer, I believe if a coin becomes ubiquitous and used in everyday life, it will likely be bitcoin.  That doesn't mean that the value of all the other technology created in this space is worth 0, or anything close to it.  It's kinda like when someone expresses an opinion that disagrees with the scientific community at large.  All the experts, or at least the majority, disagree with your assertion and have wagered an incredible amount of wealth on the idea that they are not worth 0, and will not end up worth in any short term time frame (who the hell knows 3-5 years from now).  

So while I agree that Bcash is a scam, referencing your research and stating your opinion as if it's some sort of infallible level of study when tons of other, incredibly successful and intelligent people disagree, is a quite off putting and seems a bit egocentric.  5-10 years from now, will most of these coins die off?  Sure, there will be a consolidation, and the best coins will survive while tons of coins will fall to the wayside, but that's way, way down the line, and right now you're going to make more money in alts than BTC, by far, just like last year, just like now, just like always.

"You must not know much about Bitcoin.

Bitcoin (BTC) has had lots of additions made to circumvent the 1MB blocksize limit, like SegWit. The Core team wants to keep the blockchain as small as possible, which requires drastic changes of the code. However, the additions are *optional*, which means that you *can* send a good old on-chain Bitcoin transaction if you desire - this doesn't mean you *should*, though. This is a softfork - it follows the same chain as before. When BTC upgrades you don't have to do anything in order to use the basic features.

Bitcoin Cash has increased the block size (as Core should have done back in 2015 to avoid the mess that is BCH) and readded features removed by Core or that were made impractical by the Bitcoin network being overloaded (like 0-conf). It's basically the 2013 version of Bitcoin. However, they *force* everyone to support the new features, like most other coins. Hardforks are *normal*, and they were the standard type of upgrades for the Bitcoin network back in the day. A hardfork changes the consensus rules, which means that the blockchain is forked and (hopefully) everyone switches to the new one.

None of the coins really follow the ""original"" chain. BTC has had many hardforks (upgrades changing consensus rules) in its early days, way before Blockstream and the current Core team. BCH is also obviously a hard fork. However, BCH is trying to be the ""original"" Bitcoin, for better or for worse.

And in case you think I'm a butthurt BCH fanboy - my holdings are 75% BTC - 25% BCH. I don't want either to fail, as they are both valid approaches to the scaling problem. If you'd like I could discuss my beliefs with you further.",1524853507

"I know a lot of people that think like you do. I know a lot of people that work jobs making twice what I make, still thinking like that, and looking at the fact that they need to work until they are 60. 

To me, buying my life is more important than buying things. A powerful car is nice, but it's not nice enough to trade 5 years of my life away for it. 

I'm 40, and because of the way I saved, I was able to pick up rental properties, which were insanely good investments. I sold those off in a market bubble (timed it pretty well actually). I could never have done that if I didn't save.

I got a big promotion at work, and all my colleagues who joined me (about 20 of us), nearly every one of them bought a sports car. I was driving a 5 year old van. Nothing junky, but they bought Vipers and BMW. So what's the point? They get a raise, and all they do is spend more money. They get is slightly upgraded ""things"". They aren't happier, none of them are. Infact they are miserable, because they have no purpose in life, besides just chasing money.

Instead of buying cars, I am buying time. I could technically retire now and be pretty okay, but I'm still so young, I figure I'll just keep banking money and buying crypto. 

I'm living a pretty comfy life now, because I lived in a van and erased debt for 6 years out of school. I've never bought a car over $10k, and never had much problems with them. I just don't see the point. 

I live in a nicer house than most of my bosses, who make over $300k a year. I could probably afford a house 5x as big, but I don't need it. Instead I put solar panels on my house, which will pay for themselves in 7 years, then make me more money for the next ~14 until they die.

I planted 1000 trees on my property, all edible (fruit/nuts), just as many berries, etc. I'm going to be able to grow food for the community and donate to churches. My kids are going to sit under the shade of my trees one day - hopefully my grandkids and their kids. I'm developing wildlife habitat all around me, making the world a better place. Acres of wildflowers for bees. 

I've been able to fund charities, and do sports programs for my local community.

I know it sounds dumb, but these things bring you infinitely more joy than a slightly nicer car.

If I die tomorrow? That's fine, my kids get everything. I can't take it with me, but they can benefit from it. My wife could retire and do whatever she wanted.

You save $1k today and it's literally worth $5k EASY, just on not throwing money to interest in debt and even just putting it in a GIC. 

I dunno, you can do whatever you want, but the whole world lives these throwaway lives these days, with a bunch of disposable material shit, and do nothing worthy and of purpose. 

Live with purpose, it's such a more enriching and fulfilling way to live your life. You can only do that with freedom. You can only get that freedom if you erase debt. 

Get that car, sure, but only once you have zero debt and you can buy it with the piles of cash you have lying around - because you erased debt while you were young.

I'm not arguing any points you (or anyone else) has made, I'm just generally curious if many purchased bitcoin during the peak in dec/jan over there, how did the crypto crash compare to their fiat crash since that time? I keep seeing people here say ""lol, you shouldn't have bought during all time highs"" to those unfortunate enough to do so, but what if you live in a country like Venezuela, you're kinda stuck between a rock and a hard place right?

"The thing is, Bitcoin Cash doesn't even follow the whitepaper, so what does it matter? Bitcoin Cash uses a different difficulty adjustment algorithm, it implemented FlexTrans mallability fix (Basically Segwit without the efficiency improvements) and miners and nodes are separated now. 

Plus, Bitcoin Clashic is closer to the original than Bitcoin Cash! Bitcoin Cash forked, making a new coin. Then Bitcoin Cash forked again and stole the old Bitcoin Cash name, and left the old Bitcoin Cash (BCC) to rename to Bitcoin Clashic. 

So are you trying to follow the whitepaper or not? Are you using Bitcoin Clashic or not?

It's okay to prefer on-scale solutions. Sure, it can't handle 60,000 transactions per second like LN, and can't compete with Visa, but it works now, and you can just increase the block size making new forks and new old chains. Right? 

But don't pretend that everything BCH does is to be in Satoshi vision, because otherwise, BCH wouldn't have FlexTrans. How can Segwit suck, but FlexTrans be good? Same fix, but Segwit increased the block size to 4mb, but BCH didn't want the block increase through backwards compatible.

Honestly though, I can never see either being used for small P2P / shop\-type transactions \(that need to take 10\-30 seconds or less\) due to limitations with the Bitcoin blockchain or being the popular cryptocurrency coin long term in terms of actual usage.

What Bitcoin has at the moment, even if it doesn't realistically have a better currency use case \(versus Nano, Stellar, XRP etc.\) is a brand that everyday people of heard of, a lot of everyday people know ""cryptocurrency"" as just Bitcoin and not know about any others because Bitcoin gets the majority of the press attention.

If a user were to buy ""Bitcoin"" \(BCH\) on [bitcoin.com](https://bitcoin.com) right now and then try to send it to a service that accepts Bitcoin, they would be most likely be confused to the point of sending BCH to a BTC address and if the BTC address is segwit \(not the same format as BCH addresses\) then the funds will be lost.

The problem is it seems that he (and many others) believe that BCH is bitcoin, and since it is (supposed to be) a decentralized form of currency, there shouldn't be anyone to sue at BCH.  Care needs to be taken because if legal action is pursued against a decentralized cryptocurrency, that gives governments more reason to define it as a centralized organization that can be regulated and censored.  A good outcome would be to reach consensus through testing and data that would merge BCH and BTC, but currently it's cutthroat battle until 1 of them dies (or both - which I fear would be the worst outcome).",1524852814

Because before Bitcoin Cash or Segwit existed, there was one Bitcoin, yes? Well even ignoring the fact that it was the minority that forked, the chain that changes the rules is the fork, while the chain that didn't is the original.

As the second layer solutions come online (like apps that use crypto natively and mostly invisibly) the name is akin to the importance of the name ""TCP/IP"" - very few care, very few know. 

But we know that it is NOT about the technology as much as it is about trying to hijack the momentum and the name recognition to bootstrap/jumpstart the BCH technology path. This was painfully obvious with the whole crybaby shit about ""BCash"" vs. ""Bitcoin Cash"" -&gt; the obsession with proper branding instead of saying ""call it Dog Food Coin, it fucking rules, see you in the marketplace BTC losers"". Now suddenly the argument is that it is actually called ""Bitcoin"", conveniently, after arguing for 3 months it was ""Bitcoin Cash"" (weeeeeiiiirrrrrrddd... or is it?)

The traditional financial marketplaces - the futures markets, banks, etc. don't seem to give a shit about Dog Food Coin at this point, there is one (two if you count ETH) crypto they trade. Period. Newly minted cryptoneckbeards can bitch all they want but it really doesn't matter. 

The part of this saga that I find annoying is the intent to purposely confuse, justified with the pretzel logic that BTC was Bitcoin until BCH was created and then, magically, the name transferred because ""BCH is Satoshi's actual vision"" - ignoring that when BCH was created, every system in place for BTC continued to work as it did the prior day. Adding a lot of weird noise into the marketplace (imagine if you were new to crypto and tried to wrap your head around what's going on... I can see a lot of people saying ""this is too strange and looks like middle school, not a revolutionary financial technology, my money is not going to be a part of this until it gets straightened out"").

My personal theory is he's spiteful that people didn't laud him in the early days - to his satisfaction - or that the accolades he got were eclipsed by other things.

First. Nearly every recent fork of bitcoin is named “bitcoin something”, because it is a fork of bitcoin. 

Second. It is debatable which of the two follows the original plan of bitcoin most closely, because they emphasize different priorities. 

Third. IF you think bitcoin cash hews more closely to the original vision, it’s arguable that it’s more bitcoin than the main chain. I personally don’t agree - I think they should use bitcoin cash as the name, not bitcoin, but IF you believe that, then it’s not an insane view, so it can’t be “fraud”, as some people are arguing.

Fourth. Bitcoin cash isn’t a scam because it’s essentially the pre-segwit bitcoin code plus larger blocks. If it’s a scam, so was pre-fork bitcoin imho. Roger doesn’t care about scamming people.

Confidential transaction alone doesn't solve the fungibility issue, it needs to be coupled with coin-join style shuffling to work, making the congestion on Bitcoin network much, much worse (if everyone starts using it).

The [problem](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0050.mediawiki) was an issue with the older code, and Berkeley DB that was being used in the older code.

The newer code had about 60% of the network, and the older code forked into a significant mass - creating two separate chains.  Effectively 2 coins.  

The folks who were ""up to date"" were easier to contact and organize quickly, and so they agreed to back down a version, and gave up their completely valid blocks and associated block rewards.  There was at least one double-spend.

This was particularly an issue because it was about a 60/40 split, with the 40 being older, harder to contact, fragmented, disorganized.  If was split like: 28-23-19-14-10-6, with very few pieces of common code, then any one version that forked would more rapidly see that they are falling behind.

The technological differences between the original Videotape, and what later became widely known as videotape (VHS) where much bigger, and it didn't help them keep hold of the trademark.

There were never any fraud suits because people were selling VHS as videotapes, despite the fact the difference between a VideoTape and a VHS being much greater than the difference between Bitcoin and any of its forks.

A more realistic analogy would be Linux versions. There are many different versions of Linux, all referred to as Linux. No one has ever been sued for selling ""Linux"" because it wasn't the first or ""real"" version of Linux. The only people getting sued would be people violating trademark and copyright law.

Every second that passes without a successful lawsuit against someone calling a bitcoin fork Bitcoin is evidence that can be mounted in defense that the term is not unique to Bitcoin and refers to any fork in the Bitcoin tree, just like Linux refers to any Linux version, not any in particular.

If it was impossible for the Bitcoin economy to change the PoW in opposition to miners, then Bitcoin *would* be ruled by miners (and therefore insecure for the reasons explained earlier), since there would be no recourse against attack. But in reality, miners can't do anything about a hardfork, so it doesn't matter how much hashrate they have.

Yeah I guess you are right. Crypto in general in german taxlaw is like the wild west,1524850304
Bch was created because part of the community didn't believe segwit and off chain scaling solutions were a good idea and wanted to keep transactions on chain. Bitcoin has a 1 mb block size and Bitcoin cash has a 8 mb block size which will be changed to 32 mb in I think a month. The higher block size can handle a higher amount of transactions but with a bigger blockchain to store for people who are running a node. When lightning is released it should be faster than any on chain solution but I think that it isn't the best solution. I don't think saying bch is the real Bitcoin is a good idea I just think the market should decide. This might not be the best explanation so I think you should do some other research into it .,1524850301
bitcoin core acolytes are like the antifa of the crypto movement,1524850250
"I hodl long term so it doesn't really matter for me. But I was excited about the 20 000€ btc, which was unfortunately obviously an error. ",1524850235
"First, there's the general principle - Larger blocks increase centralization pressures. Now, of course, the question is how large should the blocks be whilst still preserving an acceptable level of decentralization? I think this is what you're asking when you're wondering how is, say, 8MB too much, right?

Before replying, let's agree on one thing - When I say X MB, I mean *X MB of effective space on the blockchain*, not a block size limit. If you have 1GB blocks and you only fill 50kB/block, you might as well have limit of 100kB, and decentralization would not be impacted.

&amp;nbsp;

You don't need a ""massive data center to download 8MB every 10min"", that's not the problem. We get a lot closer to the real problem if you understand that you need to download 8MB *in a SHORT time* compared to the average block time, i.e. 10min. This is key for network security. If this condition is not satisfied, the number of orphan blocks increases, reducing security. How? Well, orphan blocks basically initiate chain forks before they are orphaned. So let's say your miner node receives two blocks at the same height. Which one do you pick to work on? Let's say you pick the first one you receive, it only makes sense. But that is not necessarily the first one other miners received! And if now another miner finds a block built on the OTHER block, you are effectively mining on a different chain (!!) so you are not securing the main chain. In the case of 1 block this may not be so clear, but the argument holds for more blocks, say 3. If the two competing chains grow for 3 blocks and then one of them wins, everyone who has been mining on the losing chain was, effectively, **not securing the network**. Not only that, you get no coins, if you mined any of the orphaned blocks! To ensure this doesn't happen, the time to transmit a block must be as small as possible compared to the block time. (Keep in mind some times blocks are created 20s apart... )

So let's say blocks are now large and miners regularly experience orphaned blocks. Miners are businesses, and they don't like losses. How can they prevent orphaned blocks? Let's say both me and you have one orphaned block every 100, so 1%. If we get together, we'll still get 1 orphaned block out of 100, except that's now 0.5% of orphans *per unit time* because we are working with twice the hash power! (Say we have same hash power.) This could be a significant amount, if the profit margins are thin. So what are we gonna do? Merge, like every other industry known to men does. Slow build up of centralization.

&amp;nbsp;

OK, so that was the general argument which you can object to by saying that 8MB can still be downloaded in a short time, especially if you are a large miner. (One objection here is that miners follow cheap electricity, NOT fast internet... but let's ignore this.) There is another argument, which is actually extremely powerful

**With 8MB blocks the blockchain grows faster than tech improves**

I know that sounds crazy, and many will object... but the maths is simple. Today the blockchain is ~160GB. 1MB blocks give you ~50GB of data per year. 2MB blocks give you ~100GB/yr. Well, 100GB means the blockchain will grow by ~60% in a year. So what? Nielsen's law of bandwidth, Google it, held for the past ~30yrs and gives you ~50% faster bandwidth per year! That's 2MB blocks, not 8MB!

What does this mean? If it takes you, say, 6hrs today to sync up a full node as a home user, and this is the time it will take you today on modern hardware, it will take you MORE than that next year. And if you let the blockchain grow with no constraints, syncing up a full node will take longer and longer, until it becomes *no longer viable for a home user*. That's centralization right there - Only businesses can run full nodes validating all the txs.

So you may say fine, let's ignore home users. But the problem is actually much stronger, and it applies to giant mining operations and server farms as well! If blocks are 1GB, that's ~50TB per year of data to download and fully validate. After a few year, **including all the tech advances** you will not be able to sync up a new node. Not even a miner. Why is that fundamental? Because if you cannot fully validate the entire UTXO set on your own, even as a miner, then you are back to a trusted setup! You must trust someone else that they are feeding you the right data so you can fully participate in the network. 

Bitcoin, as a trustless system, disappears.

Truth be told, neither really qualifies, whats really happened is that both are divergences from the original chain.

"This is a great video recently posted about their progress and where they are currently. It is short but packed with information. 

.

a few notes:

.


-INT chain 1.0 was tested in Februrary that implemented the mining function (PoW part of the chain) on the device side

-Also implements ZK-Snarks for privacy and anonymity in device and node communication

-After 2 months of testing, INT Chain 2.0 is released in beta. This will be the foundation all IoT applications will be built upon

-INT Chain 2.0 has evolved from the original single chain (PoW) architecture to the double chain (PoW and DPOS) architecture, best suited for IoT applicaiton

-Supernodes will be part of the DBFT/DPOS consensus protocol

-This split chain architecture allows for separation of work between high storage and computation nodes and low performance nodes to enable high scalability

-INT Chain 2.0 adopts INT's smart contract architecture to replace dependence on Ethereum's EVM-based smart contract. Partly for protection against Ethereum's known vulnerabilities

-Today, test devices will deploy in Canada, Germany, the US, Singapore, Beijing, Chengdu, Hangzhou, Shanghai and other locations in China

-Github is now being updated with the current code

-Blockchain explorer has been released


.


This is a lot of information but this is what I can pull from it. 


Right from the start they are building a 2 layer protocol like Bitcoin and Lightning. One with PoW which handles lower volume but higher computationally intensive work, and the other which is DPOS which will rely on staking and supernodes and process higher transaction volume. This double chain network has smart contract capability with zk-snarks implemented for anonymity and private transactions. I mean woah, you feel me?

"&gt; Besides, what you're arguing is purely hypothetical. BCH has to gain 10x it's current hashrate just to match Bitcoin, and that only if Bitcoin's hashrate stagnates. The chances of that, given the community bias towards Bitcoin as being the real bitcoin, and BCH being a fork, are negligible.

Be careful that you don't view the Bitcoin subreddit (or /r/btc for that matter) as representative of the community.  You need to look wider, and consider the number of exchanges, wallets and merchants who are using something.  The odds of Bitcoin Gold exceeding the BTC hashrate are negligible -- you need to look hard to find anyone using it.  BCH on the other hand is supported by many exchanges, many wallets, and has support from BitPay and others.  I won't say it's a sure thing that it's hash rate will surpass BTC, but the odds are far from ""negligble"".",1524848875
Maybe we should start this debate when BCH reaches 70% of BTC POW?,1524848873
"Maybe they anticipated that a bunch of raging idiots like you would claim some sort of entitlement to the name Bitcoin and use that name in a campaign to mislead those who don't know better. That would seem like a pretty far fetched prediction though, considering how *incredibly fucking stupid that would be* if it happened. OH WAIT...",1524848826

“Crypto is scary and dark. It's anti-America,” Mellon explained to Forbes earlier this year. “I am pro-America, pro-business and pro-bank. That's why I went with Ripple.”",1524848821
"From the white paper:

&gt;The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it. If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any competing chains. To modify a past block, an attacker would have to redo the proof-of-work of the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and surpass the work of the honest nodes. We will show later that the probability of a slower attacker catching up diminishes exponentially as subsequent blocks are added.

My understanding is that POW is a decision making system which only applies to chains **following the same rule set**. The total POW 'truth concept' is not applicable to chains post hard fork as the communities have decided to go their separate ways. Therefore, there is neither a need for inter-hardfork decision making post-fork nor a possibility that post-fork chains could ever reach consensus by definition.

Yes, there are many things that are ""in the spirit""  of Bitcoin that are more closely aligned with Bitcoin Cash. However, what makes Bitcoin Bitcoin is the chain with the most proof of work from the genesis block.

Now, that is not to say Bitcoin Cash isn't superior. But if someone somehow managed to convince most of the hashpower to change the protocol to remove the 21 million hard limit, for example, it would STILL be Bitcoin. At that point, Bitcoin would suck, of course, and most of us would switch or sell or whatever...  but it would still be Bitcoin.",1524848752

"Certainly.  When raising the block size, block propagation time advances exponentially in spite of a limited size increase.  The block increase is a permanent change which greatly affects the decentralization of any crypto asset.  It was an ugly time for BTC but many felt it was necessary in order to address transaction malleability.  That upgrade in itself allowed further implementations and improvements like MAST and Schnorr signatures.

While the BCH camp was shouting ""segwit is poison"", all the claims about its security being compromised has been, and still remains as FUD to date.

BCH as it is already has 70&amp;#37; of its nodes hosted on Alibaba and Amazon servers, many in Hangzhou.  The point in decentralization has already been made, until the status quo can be changed otherwise.  

I do believe that one factor that greatly hurt BCH's image at the time well was the acceptance of Jihan's covert ASIC boost.  It was evident then that he would fight against segwit tooth and nail.  Were transactions actually ""unfairly cheap"", or was he actually happy that transaction cost had risen that high?  There was also a clear trend showing transaction spam happening in definitive intervals.  I fully expect that you won't believe that, just as you'd expect that I would believe it, but that's immaterial.  I treat that time period as an attack on Bitcoin.  I believe that attacks on Bitcoin are actually beneficial in the long term.",1524848704
"So I'm no BCH shill (I don't hold it or BTC) but it's like BTC proponents here don't realize that all these posts they push to the front page only adds legitimacy and awareness to BCH.

"You sound pretty young, and likely able to take some risk. It doesn't get any easier when you have a wife and kids. You need to decide what you are comfortable with though.

One thing I'll mention though, and everyone should do this, 1-2x per year, I do this still.... assess your life and see what you can cut. You can live without ANYTHING for a month, so try cutting it and seeing if you can survive without it. If you can't, then just start it back up, but at least you learned. You'd be surprised how much money you waste.

That's the real key to long term success... living cheaper. I only mention this because you said you have expensive hobbies and ""not so cheap"" car. Hobby is one thing (I guess), see if you can reign that in a bit. But expensive cars are the trappings of 90% of people. I get it, a nice car can be fun, but you are literally trading retiring 2, 3, 4, 5 years later just so you can drive a slightly nicer car every day. It's really a complete waste of your own potential future.

Money you save today can open up opportunities tomorrow. Sure, you can't take it with you, but you also need to make the most of your mileage, which includes not being stuck in a job until you are 65. If you aren't working towards retiring in your early 50's, then you need to start thinking about it. Every penny you save helps you erase debt. Get on top of debt and start saving. Get your money working for you.

I know I may come across as that 60 year old guy who ""got a job out of college"" etc... I'm younger than that. I came out of school with hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. I did get a job, but only because I was top in my class, in a top level field. 

I started my life living in a van, not because I had to, but because I wanted to CRUSH down my debt as fast as possible. I can only invest in crypto because I was able to erase all my debt at a quite young age - because I lived extremely under my means. If I didn't do that, I wouldn't have had the opportunity to get into crypto and make money now. 

So, I'd suggest to reassess where your money is going, then lock that shit down. Erase debt. Invest in crypto, but no more than 10-20%. Focus the rest on getting on top of your finances, so that you aren't bleeding money to a bank for the rest of your life.

Another crypto project in the real estate space is Rentberry, who are taking on long-term rental instead of holiday rental, which IMHO is so much more open and ready for a big player to move into it from the crypto industry. I feel like the execution has to perfect if you want to try to disrupt real estate, also the product/market match has to be there. Instead of Rentberry just saying that their model is ""decentralized "" + ""rental"", like so many other crypto projects do.. they've got a unique angle, in that they're providing crowdfunded security deposits, where renters have a lower barrier to renting apartments (ie. only paying a fraction of what they normal do for a security deposit) and token holders can earn a passive income of 7% from lending to tenants.

"  BCH isn’t a copy, but an upgraded version, like any other hard fork upgrade.  BTC is also Bitcoin, and it is also a fork.  There are multiple Bitcoin chains with small changes between each other.  It isn’t that confusing to just recognize that there are multiple versions of Bitcoin, and use things like Core, Cash, Gold, and different ticker symbols to specify which one.  If you just say “Bitcoin,” I'll assume that you mean every version, or, if you’re replying to someone talking about one chain, then I’ll assume you’re talking about that chain.  If you use just “Bitcoin,” that can be confusing since different people use different “Bitcoins.”",1524847935

Or you could just keep your money in a bank and not have to do any of that stuff. Anyone of any intellect can use a bank account. I used to work in a bank that provided bank accounts to developmentally disabled adults. These people can't even wipe their own ass without assistance yet they could understand how to keep and operate a savings account because all they needed to remember was their bank account card and how much they wanted and then using the cash was as easy as presenting it to the cashier.

"Guys, help me - shall I invest more? Sumwise it would hurt if it would crash down to zero. But it won't break my neck, as I have an unlimited working contract, so every month, there will be salary. No wife, no kids, no house at the moment, just a ""not so cheap"" car and some expensive hobbys. So there would be room for investment. If I think about what friends of mine spend for a wedding per person which is just a single day, maybe I should invest more, as I am not close to this amount. Invested till now are a little less than 2 paychecks (taxed of course, no other option in this country). As I just have a student loan to pay which is possible during the next 10-15 years I would have quite some room. 13% of my monthly salary are going into ETF fonds each month. Private pension plan is set up as well. 
Mid-term goal is of course I flat/similar which I am saving for. But honestly, its expensive as fck where I work, so I guess 5 more years of saving for the ""own contribution"" is realistic. Maybe I won't buy anything - not sure yet.
So the question is: To gamble with crypto or not to gamble. ATM I am holding approx 20 coins with major money within the big ones and a few smaller ones with small sums. I am afraid to lose all my money but on the other hand I am greedy for more. Without risk, no reward. With ""just working"" for the rest of my life, there will be never a big move possible. Salary is quite good, still not enough for pension/house/911.

"I don't think it necessarily has to be an actual bullrun, but just any type of pump.  If a coin pumps 20% or more it will eventually correct and come back down some.  So if you sell your alt coin while it pumps into BTC and wait until it corrects you can either add more coins to that alt coin or keep the extra in BTC to collect more BTC/Sats.  This is very risky and nerve wracking so do it at your own risk.  Now if BTC does shoot up a large amount like the other day the alts usually start to lose their satoshi value, so if you sell your alts into BTC until it is done pumping and then you can buy back even more of the alts that you sold.  Again, it is hard to time it perfectly, but you should be able to earn more satoshis as long as you don't succumb to greed. ",1524847726

"It's not as simple to say that the 'users' control bitcoin. There are layers of complexity with how bitcoin enforces consensus.  You've got the speculators who are interested in price action and volatility, they are what determines price. There are companies and merchants, who are mostly beholden to the speculators -- these companies run full nodes and currency pairings which determine what market activity happens on which blockchain.  The developers provide the software which these economically important nodes are using to conduct business and are especially influential regarding consensus breaking protocol decisions.  The miners provide security to the network through their work and a mechanism for which to validate transactions.  Consumers who use bitcoin to conduct everyday business can also be influential-- albeit in a more limited capacity, since they have less of an impact on price.  

These actors all get a vote, and collectively they are what determines what is bitcoin.   It is a chaotic system which so far appears to exhibit surprising resiliency.

In practice, nobody has yet figured out ""the right"" governance model for cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has its strength from its network size and resilience. Other cryptocurrencies do not have the same advantage because mining is controlled by fewer actors, or the currency itself is heavily concentrated due to premining or founders rewards.

And then you came along. So if my response seems a bit ""off"", it's because of that. I was responding to one line of reasoning and you brought in your own.

Anyway, maybe the buyer isn't laundering their own money that is sitting in a bank account with ""cleanly earned"" money, but they could be laundering for other groups. Professional launderers use unwitting people to make bank transfers all the time to layer illicit funds. To do so with Bitcoin is even better because once the criminals have the Bitcoin, there is nothing else that can be done.

Think about it from the bank's perspective. Say ""Brad"" is buying $1K worth of Bitcoin via ACH transfer to Coinbase. Usually, the bank doesn't care, but what if they have some suspicion (for whatever reason) that Brad is being given $1.2K in illicit cash to buy $1K worth of Bitcoin on an exchange? Brad doesn't give a shit because he's making an easy $200 and the criminals get ""clean"" Bitcoins that are sourced from an exchange.

If Brad is left to continue this action and later he gets caught by authorities for participating in money laundering, the bank is looking at millions of dollars in fines for not catching this.",1524846722

I'd say it's a lot easier to get one person than it is a whole bank.

And they don't know there's money in your bank account unless you tell them either. Stealing from a bank and from a wallet are different things. If I rob a bank, I steal from everyone there, not just one person.

&gt; If you believe a bank is a great place to store your money, why are you even on this sub?

Because a bank offers services that crypto doesn't (currently, if you really want to push that point). If I were to keel over and die, my spouse/descendant/whatever would be able to get my money, where if I had it all in crypto, they'd have to hope I wrote down my private key somewhere.

&gt;Go ahead and steal my trezor or ledger, it's worthless to you since you don't know the password to get it

Go ahead and go to my bank, it's worthless to you since you don't know my password to log in. And then even if you did, I can say it was a fraudulent transaction and bring it to court.

"It creates centralization, but it is a very weak argument with respect to block size, because there are offsetting improvements in the network. 

Small block advocates argue the blockchain will no longer run on commodity hardware and network connections, leading to fewer large scale commercial operations running the network. Large block advocates have several counterpoints, 1) commercial networks are not (all) evil, 2) it allows the marketplace to finance a better network, and 3) basic fault tolerance calculations far exceed any consolidation concerns.

1. My favorite quote, ""when Bitcoin becomes a trillion dollar coin, do you really want the network running on a RaspberryPI?"". Even Satoshi mentions early on that a specialized network would evolve. And when it requires large equipment and faster networks, big money is involved, which means network actors are not going to deliberately kill their cash cow.

2. All of the factors that make Bitcoin work are an ingenious play between technology, finance and human nature. The network thrives when it allows commerce to thrive and visa versa. Greed drives the miners which in turn runs the network and provides security, making Bitcoin sound money. These are forces, like market forces, that function well when they are allowed to run freely without artificial constraints. Keeping the block size artificially limited prevents the marketplace from finding/building an optimal network (servers, storage, bandwidth, etc). In the long run, with economy of scale, a better and more secure network will be built. If it didn't a smaller block size would naturally evolve.

3. A Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (RAID) is based on spreading data across multiple (cheap) disks for better fault tolerance, where your data can survive the loss of one more drives. Fault tolerance is not unlike the nodes in the Bitcoin network but it has thousands of nodes and not just a couple of disks. RAIDs (assuming RAID 1/mirror) often only have 3 or 4 drives, because adding the 5th, 6th and 7th have a diminishing return. Each additional drive adds a fraction of improvement to the RAID as 1/(n-1). So the 101st drive is merely a 1/100th improvement. That 100th copy means very little to the RAID.

The same applies to the Bitcoin network, where each node has a complete copy of the data. The network can shrink considerably without any measurable impact on centralization. To be thorough, other factors become important, such as geographic, custodial and ideological diversity.

But with any or all of these factors, the marketplace will be the ultimate judge of the value of the network, so the question remains **where will you keep your money: on a network with a 1000 RaspberryPI or 100 professional data centers around the world worth billions.**

Early on, if influential and ethical people in the Bitcoin community prominently condemned unethical acts starting with when /u/theymos [launched massive censorship and unwarranted user banning in August 2015](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h9cq4/its_time_for_a_break_about_the_recent_mess/), there's a good chance we'd not be in near the mess we find ourselves in now.

""2x"" is the aspect of the consensus agreement that raised support for SegWit1x from the 30%-35% that it had languished in for months (never once exceeding 40% support), to the overwhelming 90%+ support SegWit2x had at lock in time.

If it worked as you said it works, then Bitcoin Cash would be Bitcoin.  Due to the changed difficulty adjustment algorithm in Bitcoin Cash, its block height is greater than Bitcoin's.

When you send the crypto back to the customer, it would be the merchant making a trade, so it would be them who would owe taxes on any gains. I'm not sure where you came up with an exact figure, since any taxes would be based on the change in value of ETH since you received it.

Bear in mind one of the major aims of Request is to simplify accounting. There will be clear records for working out your taxes for sales/refunds.

As for not being satisfied with receiving a refund in fiat value, this is how it will be. The item has a value in fiat, this is what you're paying. If you want a refund, you're refunded for the value of the item.

"If you earned the money legally, there is no laundering. No one launders money they earned legitimately unless they are trying to evade taxes.

Cash is king for money laundering, but we all know that if you need money in the bank you can't just show up to the bank with a suitcase of cash and deposit it. And to do that with large sums of cash, you need to involve other people, which is risky.

Laundering is 3 stages: Placement, Layering, and Integration. Bitcoin (and other cryptos) take the role of ""Layering"" for criminals that earned cash illegally.

Step 1: Placement: You convert dirty cash to Bitcoin. Maybe LocalBitcoins local trades or Bitcoin ATMs with no ID checks.

Step 2: Layering: You obfuscate your Bitcoins. You don't want blockchain analysis to show where the Bitcoin came from. Maybe you have an online BTC store or you trade on foreign exchanges selling to yourself to look like you are just a genius trader. Maybe you ""won"" BTC at a BTC casino. Maybe you received an accidental large ""donation"" to your blog.

Step 3: Integration: Claim your Bitcoin as legally obtained at a legit domestic exchange and sell them for fiat in the bank. Pay your taxes, donate to charities.

Not saying that actually happens on a large scale, but when you consider how easy Bitcoin and other cryptos make it hide dirty cash, I wouldn't be surprised to see usage increase for this purpose among privacy coins.

BTC is used only for speculative purpose. It has no real use in commerce anymore. It has been clearly changed by Core devs from a p2p ecash system to a congested settlement system which cannot be used a peer-to-peer cash system anymore because of the high fees and unpredictable confirmation times.

This is plain simply wrong. With stealth addresses and RingCT Verge uses the same privacy tech as Monero, but with opt in privacy while Monero uses opt out privacy (yes, you can make Monero as tranpsarent as you wish).

What you do not want to see right now: there is only one RingCT implementation on a Bitcoin codebase currently in professional review, particl, for a proof of stake coin. He will have to copy this and I am not sure this works with Verge. He is not able to implement it by himself, alone.

Furthermore stealth addresses and RingCT as opt in is already deanonymized and linked thorugh research about Monero. So selling this as a 100% privacy solution will be again a lie.

"**Streisand effect**

The Streisand effect is the phenomenon whereby an attempt to hide, remove, or censor a piece of information has the unintended consequence of publicizing the information more widely, usually facilitated by the Internet. It is an example of psychological reactance, wherein once people are aware that some information is being kept from them, their motivation to access and spread it is increased.It is named after American entertainer Barbra Streisand, whose 2003 attempt to suppress photographs of her residence in Malibu, California, inadvertently drew further public attention to it. Similar attempts have been made, for example, in cease-and-desist letters to suppress files, websites, and even numbers. Instead of being suppressed, the information receives extensive publicity and media extensions such as videos and spoof songs, often being widely mirrored on the Internet or distributed on file-sharing networks.

Strictly speaking, that is true. No one knows what the max BCH block size is. Not even the BCH developers, it seems.

What we know is that some miner produced a block slightly larger than 8 MB last year, but it was orphaned, and the coin did not split.  So, at that time at least, a majority of the miners decided that said block was too big. 

&gt; The thing that keeps a miner from making a bigger block is the fear of crossing this imaginary line, that is entirely perceptual and has no basis in data.

The risk is not that a miner might create a block that is ""too big"".  The risk is that a significant minority of miners may consider a block ""too big"", while the majority considers it ""not too big"".  If that happens, the coin WILL split.

The ONLY reason why Satoshi added the explicit 1 MB limit to the validity rules was to remove that risk.

That's the aspect of the consensus agreement that raised support for SegWit1x from the 30%-35% that it languished in for months (never once exceeding 40% support), to the overwhelming 90%+ support SegWit2x had at lock in time.

"I wanted to jump in to say that Roger and Bitcoin.com also supported the Segwit2x hard fork ABOVE the BCH fork up to the point that the 2x portion was terminated.

I recall a myriad of tweets and comments flying at Roger regarding BCH after it forked, but Roger didn't budge on his position to uphold Segwit2x. I wasn't in the room at ConsensusNY when the agreement was signed, but if ordering of signatures is an insight into anything, Bitcoin.com was one of the first companies that did so, and it seemed that Roger was not going to back down on this promise. Hell, their company stepped up and offered to provide engineering support for the devs coding the fork alongside Bitmain and Bitfury: https://medium.com/@DCGco/bitcoin-scaling-agreement-at-consensus-2017-133521fe9a77

This was corroborated further when Roger himself issued an update regarding all of the noise he was receiving during this period. (I recall it was issued as a PSA on their site, and I've been unable to find it via a light googling, but once I find it, I will be editing this post with a link to it). In this update, Roger stated that he was honoring his agreement with everyone, and regardless of what BCH was at that time, Bitcoin.com's full support was given to Segwit2x. This was after Segwit was activated, but before the 2x fork was due to activate. Roger closed the statement by highlighting his intention to see the agreement through UNLESS the 2x portion failed to activate. If this were to become the case, all of their company resources were going to transition and focus on BCH.

After the 2x activation was terminated, Roger held true to his word and began working on BCH. This company transition was announced via another PSA: https://www.bitcoin.com/public-service-announcement

You supported a potential hard fork, that's very true. You indicated this intention by signing the agreement alongside your peers, big blockers and small blockers alike. However, you were not given a hard fork. You were given one more instance of what the entire BTC community had been given for years: a broken promise.",1524841628

"Hi thanks for the response,

&gt; I looked at the links and thought to try it out but then saw it was more complicated I was supposed to get something called metamask. Also slightly concerned that may be some elaborate trick.

NoteChain is a decentralized application, the actual code which runs front-end (web ui, encryption logic, etc) and backend (database) is open. Even I put them in github and gitlab so everyone can see it and even run it in their own computer. Metamask and trust wallets are also open source.

But yes, it's not as simple as using our email to register, we should have a wallet to use apps in cryptocurrency. But once you have an email, you can register anywhere right, that's also the case with wallet. If you have a wallet (for ethereum: metamask or trust) then it means you can register to any decentralized applications.

&gt; I use Notes on my ipad for quick memos, otherwise I use OneNote for substantial notes. I tried Evernote once which is OK but honestly I didn’t need it so I stopped.

Yes it's true, that's the hard part, that's why this app offers what the non-crypto apps couldn't offer such as: privacy, always running, immutability, etc.

Giving up the name to public domain means allowing for the possibility of other people to sell under that name as a generic, just like people sold ""videotapes"" despite the fact they weren't anything like the original trademarked VideoTape, or ""Aspirin"" despite the fact they used a different formulation than Bayer. Once the trademark had lapsed you couldn't then sue people for selling you a different kind of videotape than the ones the originators of the term sold. The whole reason they lost their trademark is because they didn't stop other people from using their name.

With no trademark to begin with you have an even weaker case that the name can't apply to multiple different versions of the same open source software, just like Aspirin applies to multiple formulations of the same basic drug.

If you're going to claim that Bitcoin forks are so different than Bitcoin, that selling it as ""Bitcoin"" is the equivalent of selling someone a ""videotape"" that is actually a vinyl record, well good luck in court. The technological differences between the original Videotape, and what later became widely known as videotape (VHS) where much bigger, and it didn't help them keep hold of the trademark.

There's a cake and eat it attitude that somehow Bitcoin doesn't need a trademark but it can also enjoy the benefit of stopping any other project using the term ""Bitcoin"" (otherwise known as trademark protection), under a separate case of ""fraud"", which apparently means all trademarks are useless because you can just sue for fraud instead of having a trademark.

Linux Foundation can only stop people calling forks of Linux ""Linux"" without their permission because they own the trademark. If they had that power without the trademark, there would be no need for it. They sued to own the trademark precisely because they wouldn't have that power without it.

Your exchange still owes you “a bitcoin”, but the value of the underlying assets that they hold don’t match the value of what they now owe you. Exchanges and markets just can’t work that way.

"Your stance on most accumulated work defines bitcoin is nonsense.

1) Suppose the majority of miners would go and mine a chain that had the 21-million coin limit lifted, would you consider that Bitcoin then? No of course not. It's a consensus rule regarded as sacrosanct, you wouldn't care that that chain has more POW, it's meaningless.

2) Suppose hypothetically a sudden and massive shift in hashpower would happen and BCH where to gain the majority hashrate. BTC would still have more accumulated POW, but it'd be functionally dead because barely any blocks would get found, nobody could use it at all. The time to difficulty adjustment would recedes to infinity while the price crashes to near zero before it becomes so illiquid you can't trade it at all. Would you still consider that Bitcoin then? No of course not.

3) Suppose aforementioned hashrate calamity would happen forcing BTC to hardfork to introduce at least a dynamic difficulty adjustment such as the one that exists in BCH. They'd still have more POW, but would you still consider that Bitcoin? Well maybe, but then, why isn't BCH?

4) Same supposition on the hashrate calamity, do you think it'd make people who've already decided there's no other Bitcoin than the one BSCore peddles accept something else as Bitcoin? Well of course not, then why should people who accept BCH as Bitcoin be any different? Why don't we have the right to reject what BSCore has done to Bitcoin and reclaim what we understand Bitcoin to be and say it is Bitcoin?

5) SegWit coin is on a functional level incompatible with Bitcoin. The reason is simple, a miner that is unaware of the extended block section and consensus rules (i.e. mines the original Bitcoin), will accept a transaction that violates SegWit rules and include it in a block. This block will then be rejected by SegWit miners. From the miners perspective this is no different than a hardfork. I.e. SegWit is effectively a hardfork, just as hardforks are hardforks. Just because something hardforks doesn't mean it's no longer what it used to be. BCHs hardfork was forced upon it because of SegWit.

----

Furthermore your stance on not supporting BCH is bullshit. Here's why: More than 2 years ago you said you'd support **a** HF away from Core's leadership. You didn't qualify your statement to mean ""only if the majority of hashrate supports it"" or any such thing. You tried your version of such a HF with SegWit2X, which failed. It didn't fail on account of minority hashrate, it failed altogether to attract any hashrate whatsoever. There is a fork that has some respectable/functional hashrate and that is BCH. Back 2 years ago you didn't qualify your statement as ""but only if it's the fork I make"". You said **a** fork. Well now we have **a** fork, that works, and is supported by some amount of hashrate, but still, you won't support it? And that doesn't strike you as some form of hypocrisy?",1524840308

"Has anyone but Core ever achieved consensus since Gavin gave up control of the repository (technically, even before that)? With the contingent of the community that supports on-chain scaling leaving BTC for BCH, Core's iron-grip on control of the SegWit BTC chain has only gotten stronger.

So if Core is the only significant SW repo, and the only one in control of consensus for the SegWit chain, how does saying ""Bitcoin Core"" to refer to the SegWit chain risk any ambiguity?

"By every other criteria, I mean everything else expressed in the [Bitcoin white paper](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin), beginning with the title itself. BCH is clearly ""A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"", whereas BTC is actively making itself into a high fee, high friction, low utility store-of-value-only system. Key Core developer Greg Maxwell prominently toasted ""champaign"" to celebrate as transaction fees crested $50 just six months or so ago.  

The only criteria BCH does not have over BTC for claiming the ""Bitcoin"" name is total cumulative proof of work. And you're right, that's an important one. But I should also point out that you have to be a ""valid"" entity based on the rules of the white paper. Today's BTC has only gotten to where it is by pointedly and repeatedly subverting the white paper's prescribed Sybil-resistant Nakamoto consensus mechanism. This is no more obvious than in the fact that SegWit was illegitimately added to the BTC block chain. ""Illegitmate?"" you say? Yes, because the ""2x"" part of the SegWit2x consensus agreement was never added, so SegWit was essentially pushed on to the block chain in an end-run around Nakamoto Consensus. The ""2x"" aspect of the consensus agreement was the only thing that pushed miner support for SegWit from the 30%-35% range it was languishing in (never exceeding 40% at any point), to the overwhelming support SegWit2x had at lock-in time.

Furthermore if you look at the recent Monero fork, the hashpower was concentrated on the side of the legacy fork that the community deemed worthless.

This is something I would strongly agree with.

Despite the fact that we may view Bitcoin Cash as the 'better Bitcoin', the 'true' Bitcoin etc., there is no such thing, just as much as Bitcoin is not defined by the BTC ticker or by the Bitcoin Core repository.

I know, certain BTC supporters are claiming that even use of the name 'Bitcoin Cash' is tantamount to trying to 'steal the brand of Bitcoin', despite that the brand of Bitcoin does not belong to anyone. They have no legal leg to stand on for that, so that argument can be set aside.

If we focus on adoption of 'Bitcoin Cash', we will win this fight in the way that really matters. It doesn't really matter whether the sound money finally called 'Bitcoin', 'Bitcoin Cash', or just 'Cash', or even something else.

Bitcoin will probably be relegated to a store of value, like a 21st Century Gold. It can't be tampered with or easily stolen or counterfeited so it has some advantages over Gold, and to be honest, Gold in this day and age is useless, it has no purpose, it's just an arbitrary store of value, Bitcoin is the same.

* LN is **not** centrally controlled in any sense, shape or form - Who, in your opinion, centrally controls the LN?

"&gt; Looking at the volume indicator we can see large spikes. These large spikes cannot be caused by people like you and me, these spikes are caused mostly by institutional investors ( who invest millions of $ ). 

You don't know if they are institutional players. They can be leveraged old-time traders, with deep pockets. 

&gt; It is when a large green candle is shown ( on the volume ) that you can know with high certainty that instituional players ( whales, institutions ) are buying in.

No you cannot. First of all, just because a bar is green, doesn't mean all orders of that candle are buy orders. It is perfectly possible to have large market sell orders, and then a tiny order being executed right after, at a price market above the open session value. That would cause the candle to turn from red to green.

And that is why millions have been borrowed from the margin market at Bitfinex in the last 48 hours, just to pump up the market and create FOMO along the amateur investors. This is how pigs get slaughtered.

Institutional Investors don't buy blindly (market orders),  and they **never, ever** reveal their position. Don't expect an institutional investor to issue visible orders or market orders, unless when it is to exploit the market and move it in a very specific direction. There are algorithms specifically built just to execute these movements.",1524837284

I kind of doubt that. Heck, just look at Craig Wright. He's been very publicly caught faking proof that he's Satoshi. Cryptographically speaking it's trivial to prove whether someone is or isn't Satoshi. You can prove you own your Bitcoins by signing a message with the private key for the Bitcoins and Satoshi has a massive hoard of them. Satoshi also said that anyone who would ever consider deleting their private keys was a fool. The fact that Craig Wright has never given proof of anything and in fact published a fake signature would make any rational person conclude that he's a fraud.

I have no doubt that if Satoshi actually came back, proved that he controls the Bitcoins from the genesis block, and said that Bitcoin Cash was not Bitcoin there would be plenty of people sticking with the lie that Craig Wright is Satoshi and clearly this new Satoshi must be a fake.

And really, even if Satoshi did decide to start working on Bitcoin again, that doesn't mean that everyone should just abandon Bitcoin Cash.

"During the mtgox fiasco in 2013 / 2014 we learned about transaction malleability. Basically this was a bug in bitcoin that allowed people to make certain changes to their transaction before it was confirmed. This bug could be exploited by malicious hackers.   

In order to fix this, Segwit was proposed as a solution.  
Segwit also disabled a mining exploit called covert asic boost. CAB allowed certain miners to secretly mine at a greater efficiency than others.  
Certain miners (Jihan Wu who is the CEO of Bitmain) wanted to continue utilizing this exploit and did not want Segwit adopted.  
On August 1st the hard fork happened and Bcash was created to avoid Segwit so certain miners could continue their covert exploit.  
In late August, Segwit was activated within Bitcoin but not Bcash.   

Jihan Wu, Roger Ver, Craig Wright and a few other individuals who are behind Bcash have since started a social deception campaign to try to convince people Bcash ***is*** bitcoin.  
Roger Ver who owns bitcoin dot com has utilized shady deception by referring to bitcoin as ""Bitcoin Core"" and Bcash as ""Bitcoin (BCH)"".

"To reach larger scale and capacity, networks are usually upgraded using 2 methods: 1) optimizations 2) additional protocol layers. The Bitcoin network implemented two such changes: Segregates Witness is an optimization. Lightning is an additional protocol layer. Both these upgrades did not require a hard fork of the code (which is risky) but a soft fork (more secure). There was consensus for that soft fork in 2017, so it happened and Bitcoin has now higher capacity thanks to Segwit and Lightning.
The people behind BCH believed that it's better to just make the blocks bigger to reach higher capacity. Making the blocks bigger can only be done via a hard fork. Because there would have been no consensus in Bitcoin for such a hard fork, they created there own coin via hard fork, which they called Bitcoin Cash (BCH). It's an altcoin that almost everyone would be alright with it, but: BCH proponents keep spreading misinformation about their altcoin, calling it ""the real Bitcoin"", a lie they will tell to you with a straight face.

"So, crypto exchanges are ripping us more than the banks?",1524836002
"With 1mb blocks Bitcoin does on average 3-7 tx per second.  This is the result of the average tx size that can fit in a 1mb block and the target interval of 10 minutes.  

So there are 2 easy ways to scale bitcoin.  You can increase the blocksize or you can lower the block time.  

Lowering the blocktime sends the wrong message because then your transactions are less secure.  IE if you're waiting for 6 blocks normally then we drop to 5 minute blocks ... now you should wait 12 blocks.  It also grows the size of the blockchain faster, but that's not the end of the world.  

You could increase the blocksize as well.  So 2 mb would get you from 6-14 tx per second that's a linear progression.  

Now to understand the beef between BTC and BCH you must understand the fundamental principle that BTC was founded upon.  That is that everyone controls bitcoin and no one controls bitcoin.  What that means is Bitcoin must be beyond the control of any corporation or government.  PERIOD.  The second a country or group of countries can change the Bitcoin protocol with hashing power the experiment is over fuck it forget it lets start over and try again.  

With Bitcoin Cash supporters many of them like Craig Wright for example are perfectly fine with banks, governments, and corporations running Bitcoin.  

So the question is does increasing the blocksize necessarily lead towards centralization?  Well there are a few factors in play.  Hard disk space, bandwidth, and block validation/propagation.  

So the Bitcoin Core team doesn't unanimously reject a blocksize increase.  Segwit was a blocksize increase if you use segwit.  It also rendered cover ASICBoost (a real threat to Bitcoin) obsolete.  Not to mention fixing transaction malleability making Bitcoin safer for smart contracts and the lightning network.  

The Bitcoin Cash team has all of their money on just making the blocksize bigger and improving block propagation.  The reality of the matter is they can't really improve the block propagation efficiency the Bitcoin Core devs have pretty much beaten that horse to the ground already.  The only real way to improve it beyond it's current performance would be to restrict miners from excluding transactions in blocks and being very strict about the ordering of transactions.  Which when you think about it is a terrible idea for a number of reasons. 

So where do we want Bitcoin to be in the near future?  7000 tx per second?  50,000 tx per second?  This would require a gigabyte block or a terabyte block.  The fact of the matter is this would make running a mining pool extraordinarily expensive.  The days of being able to spin an emergency pool up in a couple hours would be long gone.  Small pools would be impossible to run without some sort of charity.   Forget just the hard disk space, but think about the network connections and processor speed required.  This is a no-go for anyone who wants Bitcoin to remain nationstate hard despite their apparent cautious approval of the new technology based financial  sector. 

We want Bitcoin to be able to be ran by people of modest means.  We want poor people to be able to run full nodes so they don't need to trust anyone or group of people on the network.  We want Bitcoin to be able to run over many mediums and not just fiber internet.  We want it to be able to run over radios and satellite networks which are probably decades away from catching up to the speeds we can get over fiber if they will ever catch up that is.  

So the question is really where do you stand on the politics of Bitcoin and crypto in general?  Personally I believe the only reason Crypto exists is because Bitcoin exists.  If Bitcoin falls everything else falls.  The only reason they are not attacking crypto now is because they realize they can't stop Bitcoin and taking a cautious welcoming approach to all of crypto is better for distribution (tricking people out of their Bitcoin) and why bother going after small fish if you can't take down the fish that matters.  

Technically speaking for bitcoin cash to grow it necessarily must become more centralized.  It will still be a distributed system, but centrally controlled like Ripple.  

The only reason the chain even exists today is because they permit covert ASICBoost.  If they were to find a way to solve covert ASICBoost the chain would die overnight because Jihan (bitmain) would stop mining it immediately.  ",1524835992
"While you probably mean very well and BTC is not without its shortcomings, BCH through no fault of yours, conducts itself in an equally and arguably worse way.  r/BTC prides itself in not censoring topics but you know well they've done so, \(take today's room77 post\).  r/Bitcoin is openly known for censorship.  r/BTC is known for celebrating every underhanded hit they score against the other side.

Some people couldn't care any less about both.  With what you see on [Bitcoin.com](https://Bitcoin.com) though, I absolutely think that the entire ordeal will backfire far worse than whatever gains are hoped for.

In all honesty, Bitcoin Cash could have been something else.  It could have been marketed as the better Bitcoin.  It could have discussed its merits, its advantages, all in a positive light without all the shenanigans.  It could have welcomed all and taken the high road.  Instead, all most people see now are a bunch of privileged onion\-skinned pre\-2015 bitcoin holders who got pissy because a sub banned them and they took it all against the community, even if the entire community signalled positively for segwit and smaller blocks.  Now you have all the silly claims of ""poisoned segwit"", ""0\-conf is great"", ""nodes are useless"", ""BCH is decentralized"", coming from clueless noobs and trolls.  It doesn't help that this is the same community that supported and tolerated Craig Wright, turned a blind eye to Jihan's covert ASIC boost, and championed and put Roger Ver on a pedestal.  

I absolutely think that if Roger would disappear right now, the entire stack of cards will just collapse.  While many don't have a horse in this game, out of principle, it's hard to side with BCH.  So much baggage.  All of you belong to Ver and Jihan.  You just don't know it or want to admit it yet.  Disapprove of blocks greater than 8MB?  Not convinced of 1GB blocks?  Want to fix transaction malleability?  Try forking Bitcoin Cash to a variant that he doesn't approve of.  Good luck with that.  Thing may not exactly be as different as you think they are on both sides.",1524835988

"Bitcoin *is defined* by what the majority thinks. The consensus mechanism is designed so that the majority chain is what all the ""honest"" software nodes running  take as the correct chain.

""Honest"" here does not mean ""running by the original rules"". The rules of Bitcoin have changed in the past, but the majority have decided to go with the rules that exist now. ""Honest"" just means that they're not dishonest (ie, trying to intentionally game the system in their favor). If Bitcoin somehow does manage to get hijacked by dishonest nodes, then the whole experiment has failed, and we would need to try and come up with other ways to achieve consensus.

It's likely that if there were such a tight split of 51%/49%, that the difference would not be able to be determined accurately anyway and people would flock towards the chain which had either the highest value (relative to other cryptocurrencies), in which case the markets would decide which is the ""real Bitcoin"".

What's missing here is that in order to gather up enough heads to want to adapt breaking changes, there would be lots of attention about the issue and people would come up with names ahead of the split. Such names would likely persist after the split if it were tightly contested. If there were a clear winner then the winner would be Bitcoin.",1524835908

The only thing stopping anyone from forking Linux and selling it as Linux is the Linux Trademark and the GNU Licensing agreement which comes from copyright law. That is why the Linux Foundation sued for ownership of the trademark, because you can't control who uses the name without owning the trademark.

You can fork linux and sell it as linux with permission from the Linux Foundation. You could not sue someone for selling a ""fake"" Linux fork if they had permission from the trademark owner because it is the trademark owner who decides who can use the name. A court would not be able to say ""but that fork isn't made by the original creators, it doesn't have as many people using it, its FRAUD to call that linux, its not the real linux!"".

If the originators could just claim anyone selling a version of the software with the same name was selling a ""fake"", there would be no need for trademark law. Trademark exists to determine who is the genuine source of a product.

Claims like ""Bitcoin has the majority consensus and the most work so it is the real Bitcoin"" has absolutely no basis in trademark law.

The law makes no determination over which is the ""original"" project or not. Even being the company that produced the product and registered the trademark (like Bayer and Aspirin) is not enough to guarantee sole exclusive use of a product name. ""Aspirin"" now refers to any generic acetylsalicylic acid product regardless of who made it or what particular formulation its in, because Bayer didn't defend their trademark.

Not only has Bitcoin not defended its trademark, it hasn't even registered one. Bitcoin forks would have a trivial time proving their entitled to the use of ""Bitcoin"" as evidenced by 9 years of no prosecutions for infringing on the trademark.

I think it's fair to say that laws are just in a gray area right now.  Prosecuters (some who may be over eager to earn a reputation with something as buzzword worthy as Bitcoin) are trying to fit old laws over a completely new creation.

"**Q2.** LN could work without SegWit. The videos you've seen probably confuse SegWit with ""malleability fix"". *Not* because SegWit is not a malleability fix, it is, but because it can be done otherwise. LN could be deployed on a blockchain with a different malleability fix. Additionally, LN could work **without** malleability fix, but that adds one layer of complexity. In this case, the software would have to keep monitoring for attempts at malleated txs. So in this sense, with malleability on the base layer, LN is less safe as it will inevitably introduce more bugs.

**Q3.** Larger blocks do increase centralization, no doubts about that. And it's also true that at some point a block size increase will be necessary... though exactly when and what the magnitude of the increase will be is not clear. But before increasing the block size, there are various optimizations that will be deployed. One, Schnorr will allow for signature aggregation thus reducing the average txs size by ~25%. (The main reduction comes from txs with many inputs.) MAST will further reduce txs sizes for complex scripts ad smart contracts. All of this saves space on the blockchain, so delays the need for a block size increase, even if not by much. Perhaps most importantly, ""channel factories"" can be built to dramatically reduce the blockchain impact of using LN. If enough people get together to form a channel factory, the impact on the blockchain can be reduced up to 96% compared to individually opening/closing channels. That's quite the optimization. Once all of this will be built and in use, then the block space needs will be better understood, tech will have improved and a block size increase will be appropriate.

On the r-bitcoin ban...

There's a ~$150bn dollar bounty out there. Heck, take this address, 	3D2oetdNuZUqQHPJmcMDDHYoqkyNVsFk9r, there's ~200k BTC in it. Go take that money and prove the world that SegWit has a flaw.

"Then you are saying Bitcoin can never, ever, HF in any way that changes consensus rules. Even if 99% of the community supports it.

I think that’s nonsense. ",1524834638
"It is possible to have rules and standards without a governing body. I mean bitcoin exists. If the calculation of pB is made purely algorithmically it would be trivial for merchants and wallet makers to implement it without a central authority with just some api calls to some major currency exchanges.

But first there needs to be some kind of consensus among enough users.

A quick and dirty algorithm would be to take the average values over one month of the 5 largest fiat currencies and the average value of bitcoin during the same period on the first of every month and create a pB modifier that closest aligns one pB with the average fiat value closest to say one dollar. Or perhaps the value should only be calculated every quarter for better comparison stability.

Showing the price of a product as ""1 month = 0.00058 BTC"" like it often is today isn't intuitive for humans and actually hinders adoption in some ways. Humans don't handle fractions well so instead sites have to present the dollar/euro price as well as the btc price which creates an unnecessary coupling to fiat (even if my proposed system would be based off of fiat internally)",1524834626

Meanwhile all the ASIC miners have billions of dollars invested in hardware they're not going to just throw away. They're going to start mining BCH.

Does that mean BTC is no longer Bitcoin and that BCH is? Will BTC supporters concede the Bitcoin name?

It's also conceivable that at some point in the future the majority of miners simply abandon BTC and switch to BCH. If that happens, BCH will eventually become the chain with the most SHA256 proof-of-work. Do you think BTC supporters will concede the name then?

Having recovered from a five-day low hit yesterday, bitcoin (BTC) has potential for a move higher towards major resistance at $9,880, the technical charts indicate.

The cryptocurrency moved back above $9,000 in the Asian hours after the pullback from the recent high of $9,767 ran out of steam around the ascending (bullish) 4-hour 50-candle moving average (MA).

As of writing, BTC is trading at $9,251 on Bitfinex, representing marginal losses over the previous day's close (as per UTC) of $9,270.

A bearish follow-through to Wednesday's bearish outside-day reversal would have been bad news for the bulls, but BTC instead appreciated by 4.5 percent on Thursday, keeping them in the game. Had BTC closed yesterday below $8,765 (Wednesday's low), the bears would have had the upper hand for the short-term.

"I know there are a number of OTC dealers functioning in this market as I've run across mentions of them in news articles over the last six months.  To some extent, they probably stay in touch with one another. What I don't know is where, if anywhere, their OTC trades get posted.  

My guess is they don't get posted at all which is why the criticism came forth over the Mt. Gox sales back in Dec. and Jan.  If the trustee had done his selling OTC, it may not have negatively effected BTC's price - no whale size orders would have been seen that spooked the market. Transactions that don't get reported do not get noticed/effect in the price nor seen in the volume on various reporting web sites like CMC.  (by the way, that means that the total market cap is probably never accurate)

So when would OTC activity have an effect on the price of BTC?  Recently, there has been talk among some of the crypto YouTubers that buyers seeking BTC in the OTC market were unable to buy; that the supply of sellers was down to practically none.  Therefore, in order to purchase BTC, the buyers who would ordinarily do so OTC, had to go to the public markets to acquire it. Since OTC operators are normally large buyers, their purchases in the regular market (even if spread over days) would increase demand and clean out sellers there and then the price would move up.  Supposedly, that is what we saw recently that accounted for BTC's run up close to the $10K level.

In the example posted by jp4ragon, the price of BTC probably moved up AFTER the OTC buys were done. 

This is my guess, based on some logic, not facts in my possession.",1524833482
"You should be cautious.  There are tons of FUD accounts on the web -- some of them run entire popular crypto blogs that people rely on -- because marketing reverse pressure means that the mental midgets will move the market in a direction that smarter people can strike at.

There are hundreds of well seeded accounts on twitter and FB and reddit and other places that exist solely to move price in a reverse direction momentarily.  It doesn't cost anything to manage these accounts and if you can get 1% slippage, it's enough to profit from.

BTC is a bit more difficult to manipulate this way, but all the other cryptos are happily pushing profits to the marketing moguls.

FUD is just marketing.",1524833472

Moreover, since BTC today has only gotten where it is by subverting Nakamoto Consensus repeatedly (where's that ""2x""?), I would argue that BTC is not legitimate or ""validly"" Bitcoin per the white paper either.

"**Pullback Over? Bitcoin Retakes $9K, Eyes Further Gains**

https://www.coindesk.com/pullback-over-bitcoin-retakes-9k-eyes-further-gains/

Having recovered from a five-day low hit yesterday, bitcoin (BTC) has potential for a move higher towards major resistance at $9,880, the technical charts indicate.

The cryptocurrency moved back above $9,000 in the Asian hours after the pullback from the recent high of $9,767 ran out of steam around the ascending (bullish) 4-hour 50-candle moving average (MA).

As of writing, BTC is trading at $9,251 on Bitfinex, representing marginal losses over the previous day's close (as per UTC) of $9,270.

A bearish follow-through to Wednesday's bearish outside-day reversal would have been bad news for the bulls, but BTC instead appreciated by 4.5 percent on Thursday, keeping them in the game. Had BTC closed yesterday below $8,765 (Wednesday's low), the bears would have had the upper hand for the short-term.

"Any answer to your question would be purely speculative.  A global crash of that magnitude could move money into crypto, but since the public generally treats crypto as a store of value and speculative investment, its unlikey they will sink their now weaker dollars into this.  Anyone owning crypo already may be in a better spot than their neighbors, but then 2 issues arise:

A) What average retailers are accepting it as payment?

B) Exchanging it to a weak devaluing fiat is kind of pointless. 

I personally get the feeling that if a crisis occured greater than the 2008 crisis, more people would cash out of crypto then would buy in.  Might not seem logical, but recall how many people cashed out their 401ks against general advice in 2008.  (I'm 28, so yes I was around and working when the 08 crisis happened).  In general, the public is often stupid and act against their best longterm interests.

2. Bitcoin cash was created by a range of people, and was as grassroots as one can get.  The futures market was created by ViaBTC, the code was launched by Bitcoin ABC, the contingency plan was supported by Bitmain, and a plethora of exchanges began to list Bitcoin cash as they were either looking to make profit, or support the vision, or both.
3. An ""altcoin"" requires a ""Bitcoin hater"" like ""e.g jstolfi"".  Well, that is a rather pointless bullet.

"&gt; The chain with the most PoW is not per se the ""real"" chain.

I disagree.  I say,

&gt; It is strictly necessary that the longest chain is always considered the valid 
one. Nodes that were present may remember that one branch was there first and 
got replaced by another, but there would be no way for them to convince those 
who were not present of this. We can't have subfactions of nodes that cling to 
one branch that they think was first, others that saw another branch first, and 
others that joined later and never saw what happened. The CPU power 
proof-of-work vote must have the final say. The only way for everyone to stay 
on the same page is to believe that the longest chain is always the valid one, 
no matter what.

If miners are able to

&gt; make a fork of bitcoin that removes the 21 million cap, reduces the blocksize limit to 50KiB and allows arbitrary TX reversals by a third party, and somehow base it on the existing chain **and accumulate more PoW**

then that will be Bitcoin.  I bolded that last text because obviously it's trivial to code up the changes you suggest.  What would not be trivial is convincing the market to pay ~$10K/coin for the coins being mined, which is the only way to accumulate more proof of work.

But.  If this nearly-impossible feat of economic hoodwinking were to be pulled off, then yes, it would perforce mean that the market recognized the new chain as ""Bitcoin"" because it was paying for ""more proof of work.""",1524833180

"&gt;&amp;gt; Yeah old nodes are cheated into following a node they cannot fully audit anymore.
This is an hack and a very dangerous slippery slope.

&gt;I don't agree, and call it what you want I don't really care. In the end this is what people wanted.

I disagree, segwit only activated after a 2MB HF was promised, before that it had even less miner vote than Bitcoin Unlimited.

Segwit was strongly contentious.

&gt;&amp;gt; (Such upgrade allow to break consensus while leaving node powerless against the change)

&gt;Old nodes can continue to operate as usual. If they want to use non-segwit tx they can do so.

No

Their security is degraded to SPV security (they have to « trust » segwit transactions are valid), and they don’t propagate transactions anymore.

They are zombie node.

&gt;&amp;gt; SF can lead to split just like HF, that’s the simple truth.

&gt;lol xD my oatmeal breakfast now causes hardforks too

Segwit was contentious, that’s what led to the split.

Segwit is literally the only reason BCH exist.

&gt;no one has said blocksize should *never* be increased.

Well last time some tried to increase the block size by the smaller increments (2MB)they have been violently attacked (after segwit activated obviously.. click-n-bait)



&gt;&amp;gt; Certainly not, returning to the fundamentals was the whole purpose of BCH.

&gt;the DAA you got is a departure from the fundamentals. 

No the white say that difficulty algo much keep emission stable, which it does a better job at.

&gt;That *actually* changes the incentives on the network as miners have no power as to what protocol changes are implemented,   

Please elaborate.

&gt;as the DAA will always ensure that blocks are generated. Do you understand?

DAA or not block can be generated.

&gt;How can you miss my point so entirely? It has nothing to do with coin emission - it has to do with bcash' vision of miners being the important players on the network. 

Do you realize that BTC always upgrade via soft fork...

Soft fork give all power to miner! BTC give much more power to miner than BCH.

&gt;Now, with the DAA hashpower has no say on the network with regard to protocol. 

That’s an extraordinary claim, please elaborate.

&gt;Bitcoin ABC could implement a ""fuck miners patch"" and have economic nodes and other important non-mining nodes implement it and miners could do nothing to prevent it. Blocks would be generated, with or without majority of hashpower.

This apply to any blockchain... sigh...

If this fork has no support it will die off, nothing new here..

I fail to see how that’s somehow « changing bitcoin » your argument are getting weak it seems..

If someone fork it can change the difficulty target and generate block without changing the BTC DAA exactly the same..

&gt;There are some other more ""fluffy"" characteristics as being able to audit the whole chain youself (bcash doesn't really care about this), 

Neither did satoshi.

SPV are literally in the white paper.

The everybody need to verify is a rather new thing.

&gt;and that the whole system is secure, 

Small blocksize is no guarantee of security.

&gt;but other than that I'd say whatever the community wants. If it turns out DAG is superior to a blockchain I'd have no problem doing that for example.

I agree but that would be another project.


&gt;&amp;gt; Technically block are still 1MB, patched with extra data.

&gt;Technically they are not. They are larger than 1 mb all blocks now. But if you only have an old old node you only get the tx data without witness data.

It is literally the same thing I said. 

Old node can’t fully audit the chain, they have been « hacked out »

&gt;&amp;gt; What a ridiculous statement.

&gt;As I said, you need some authority to tell you what bitcoin should be. Think for yourself.

No you need a reference to a currency, the white paper is.

If there is no reference and all its characteristics are free to change anytime possible then the currency cannot retain long term value.


&gt;&amp;gt; SF are coercive, using them to change the currency make bitcoin no difference than a centrally planned currency.. (node are powerless to SF.. as they see the rule change made)

&gt;meh, buy another coin if you don't like it.

As a developer, you should realize if you can't operate within the bounds of a white paper, you have no business claiming what you are doing is part of that project.

"I did not bring up the altcoins as examples *accidental* forks. (the only one I know for sure was the 2013 database bug), but as consequences of the lack of a governance mechanism.

As for different block size limits potentially causing coin splits, that is not my imagination: it is an **obvious** fact, that Satoshi immediately explained to Jeff Garzik in 2010 when Jeff posted a patch to increase the block size limit. 

Jeff may have understood that point in 2010, but he did not understand the point of the block size limit, because in 2014 or so he proposed BIP100, which had at least five big problems: (1) it assumed that the block size limit should matter to miners or users -- specifically, that it should be an effective  constraint on the size of *normal* blocks; (2) it was a *variable* limit, which, as I explained, makes no sense; (3) it reacted *very* slowly to miner votes; (4) it allowed the miners to vote to *reduce*  the limit, which made no sense; and (3) he did not specify a ""block size limit limit"" beyond which the block size limit should not be adjusted by his mechanism. 

Because of problem (5), BIP100 in fact did not achieve at all the **only** goal of the block size limit: ensure that all implementations agreed on the max acceptable block size, to avoid  the risk of coin split.  Each implementation of BIP100 would have its own implicit ""limit limit"", and therefore different implementations could end up with different block size limits. And indeed the BitcoinXT implementation of Bitcoin Cash, which was supposed to implement BIP100, has an internal 32 MB ""block size limit limit"" (which apparently the XT developers themselves had forgotten about).",1524830263
"Not all of those are bitcoin forks. So, no. ",1524830253
"I don't understand what you mean by ""value is transferred to another network"".  If the fed bought up a ton of bitcoin, the price of bitcoin goes up, then the bought bitcoin is transferred to sidechain, that doesn't remove value from bitcoin network.  In fact now you have inflated bitcoin price followed by reduced supply of bitcoins, this would have a further positive effect on bitcoin price.  None of this equates to lower transaction activity on the Bitcoin network that I can see as bitcoins are highly divisible and with a simple change could be infinitely divisible.

If the only/main holders of fedcoin are the fed, then there aren't buyers on the market for fedcoin and the fed essentially pumps the price of bitcoins huge and burns the money they spent by converting them to tokens that doesn't have a market yet.

The thing to remember is that each token has it's own market.  Price is determined by buyers and sellers.  Just because someone converts billions worth of bitcoin into another token doesn't mean those sidechain tokens are now worth billions unless the market for that token supports that price as well.  A market would develop for fedcoin, but only because there would be value in the token as it could be converted back as bitcoin.  For fedcoin to hold similar or greater value as bitcoin it would have to be as desirable based on it's own merits, otherwise people will just buy them at a discount to convert them back to bitcoin.

Not sure why you seem to think removing bitcoins from circulation would somehow damage the usability of bitcoin, the Bitcoin transfer network would work as it does now.  The only change would be the price for each bitcoin would be hugely inflated which if anything would create even greater profits/incentives for bitcoin miners.

I (or the fed) could buy a shit ton of bitcoin and remove them from circulation by sending them to a burn address.  This is not burning value of bitcoin by doing this, just giving away the money spent on burnt bitcoins to all other bitcoin holders.  None of this would impact bitcoin transactions or miner security negatively in any way.

If the fed wants to inject a ton of new money to make bitcoin holders much richer then that sounds great.  But I won't be holding my breath for that act of charity from them.",1524830251

There is no question that by Satoshi's definition, the BTC chain is the valid Bitcoin chain.  But by the small-blocker / UASF definition, the individual determines validity based on his choice of client, which means that we can say ""Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin"" with a straight face to them, because we're demonstrating the outcome of their own logic.

In reality, BTC is Bitcoin and BCH is Bitcoin Cash, but it's possible that Bitcoin Cash can overtake BTC in hashpower.  As it turns out, BTC ain't built to roll like that, so if / when this happens, then BCH will be ""Bitcoin"" because the BTC chain as we know it will die.",1524829250

Why would it be pointless? Who is to say there can be only one? The point of capitalism and freemarkets is that competition drives innovation and drives price down.

**But** we do need to reduce the amount of disingenuous portrayals that exist around development, such as this. It is a great step forward, but it's not a partnership. Just like Verge x Pornhub (arguably good or bad depending on your stance). I realise the different is the team did not call the plugin a partnership, a reddit comment did, whereas Verge said it was going to be a massive partnership.. You get the point",1524828599

You know that the same people that mine ""centralized BCH"" also mine ""decentralized BTC"" right?

These are the people your nonmining node ""protect"" you from, right?

So one day, when a consensus of hashpower starts mining bigger blocks, your client will reject these blocks.  If anyone is still mining the smaller-block chain, it will be insecure and subject to constant reorgs or attacks.  That will be the chain you will be following.  It will eventually stall.

Now tell me, do you:

A. congratulate yourself for having foiled the evil miners by refusing to follow their invalid chain, or

B. scramble to upgrade your client because the coins on the chain you're following are unspendable

For taxes (Einkommensteuer) one could conclude that it's similar: cryptos treated like foreign fiat money. So like I said, Spekulationsgeschäft within 1 year buying and selling and being paid for mining in crypto should follow the same rules as being paid in foreign fiat currency.

The coin is there for the users right? Miners only deliver a service, so it makes a lot of sense that users have the final say, and we learned that in this event. If you don't like it stay on Bcash, but don't call it Bitcoin because it simply isn't.

"What I'm saying is in your linux analogy, it'd be more accurate to compare ""Bitcoin"" with ""CentOS/Debian/RedHat"" rather than ""Linux"".

Like Debian, Bitcoin is a brand name, so while a fork of Debian is still Linux, it's no longer ""Debian"". Until now, Forks have never tried claim rights to the _exact_ parent brand name if they don't have the majority community support.

So if you made a really shitty fork of Bitcoin, it'd still be ""bitcoin technology"" and it'd still be a blockchain product; but it would no longer be bitcoin.

Similarly, if you took a really shitty fork of Debian, you could still say ""powered by debian"" or ""debian technology"", hell, you could call it ""debian gold"" or ""debian cash"" - It's still Linux, but it's no longer ""debian"".",1524827058

I don’t see heavy merchant adoption at all. I saw merchants lose faith in it over Christmas and now look at alternatives. It has become an alternative because of the fees fiasco, which was brought about by congestion, which could have been handled better. 

I say this as someone that holds BTC because I hope the situation will improve. But I really don’t see that it will. LN is a complete joke and there seems to be bad politics and infighting between BCH / BTC which harms both initiatives.

Ok, I must be dreaming then, all these volumes on exchanges and the trades happening must be all fake. The Bitcoin whitepaper didn't talk about EDA, why did Bitcoin Cash changed the ""original vision"" ? 

&gt; The one created by many changes mostly coming from the Core group, may be called Bitcoin Core.‡

You do realise that Bitcoin Cash ABC (main client) is a copy of the Bitcoin source code right ? 

&gt; If the Core group objects to its name being used in this context, perhaps they can suggest an alternative label.

There is a no such thing as Core group. Bitcoin is an ecosystem. The following actors decide what Bitcoin is.

* users
* miners
* developers
* merchants

And the majority has decided that BTC is Bitcoin, BCH is not.

How many tide pods you had before even writing this? Some serious mental gymnastics. Golden medal for sure.",1524825525
"You're right, users and miners *could* change the block size limit at any stage. But they haven't, because (1) the Bitcoin Core software implementation will not raise the limit, (2) a precedent has been set in which running an alternative software implementation is perceived as a revolt against Bitcoin. All of this adds up to a *de facto* state in which Bitcoin Core is permitted to centrally plan block space. 

Fortunately, since August last year we now have two viable chains, one of which supports a gradual removal of the block size limit and alternative software implementations and development. It's now up to economic forces to decide which network is most useful.",1524825517

"As much as you'd like to change the definition of words, language does not work in such way. Language is organic, it derives from usage. **Altcoin has always meant a coin other than Bitcoin**, and has been used heavily for that purpose over the past 6 years or so. There are people who seek to try and manipulate language for political purposes, lets not become them.

Innovations are happening on Bitcoin, but cryptographic breakthroughs don't happen overnight.

A large part of the altcoin space is in attempting to solve specific problems, or just issuing a ""token"" to represent a possible future value, like a stock. They're not in the business of providing a cryptocurrency which can't be controlled by a small handful of parties who could collude.

Thus Bitcoin must be conservative in its developments. It can't just adopt the next new or hip thing without weighing the long term effects on the currency. Bitcoin ultimately wants to remain decentralized, censorship resistant and cheap enough for anyone to contribute *as an equal party*, and not a second class citizen.

Bitcoin also doesn't solve every problem, and some of the other solutions are more suitable. There are also other innovations which are happening that would probably be welcome in Bitcoin in the long term, but we need both the technology to be tested and mature, and to solve other methods of governance over the network development to ensure that it's not just controlled by single parties. (ie, a colluding group of miners or a colluding group of software developers). So far nobody has *solved* these issues, but various PoS systems show some promise.",1524824861

If it is done via a SF to force the change (lack of consensus) on the network, then it will be an attack on the network by the miner (miner have full power to activate soft fork) then this fork will be illegitimate for me and I will support an split out the corrupted chain.

So for Bitcoin Cash, we're currently trying to become ""Bitcoin"" by achieving most cumulative proof of work. In other words, BCH is demonstrating the process of Nakamoto Consensus in action, but its still in the midst of trying to earn that consensus. If BCH never achieves most cumulative proof of work it not only wouldn't be ""valid"" per the white paper, it should probably write up its own addendum to the white paper legitimizing its own consensus rules in order to document what's ""valid"" for Bitcoin Cash, and how it can legitimately evolve.",1524824715

Bcash came out as backfire to the initiative of that camp that Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin. I don't see anyone here stressing out over Bitcoin Gold and calling it Bgold, do you?
So if there will be any other Fork of Bitcoin that will claim it is the real Bitcoin, it will receive the same treatment from the community.
And no this Coin is not and will never be Bitcoin. There is so much money trow on marketing of Bcash through every commercial channel that is under Vers control and yet 90% of the community is seeing it as Altcoin. So having this kind of attitude where you claim to be smarter than the rest 90% of the people out there is really annoying and arrogant.

From wiki:

In telecommunication, a communication protocol is a system of rules that allow two or more entities of a communications system to transmit information via any kind of variation of a physical quantity. The protocol defines the rules syntax, semantics and synchronization of communication and possible error recovery methods. Protocols may be implemented by hardware, software, or a combination of both.

Are you trying to argue that Bitcoin doesn't outline the syntax, means of communication and synchronization,  and error recovery?  That it's only a socieconomic design outline and nothing more?",1524824463

Personally, I'd add a few of other restrictions for what could legitimately be considered Bitcoin.

The 2013 ""database bug"" was an instance when different implementations disagreed about the validity rules, because of an obscure bug in the use of a database library.  The discrepancy resulted in a fork of the bitcoin chain that lasted for dozens of blocks.  

The fork did not survive for long because Gavin contacted the major miners who were extending one branch and convinced them to downgrade to an earlier release, and work instead on the other branch (even at the cost of losing all the rewards that they had gained since the split).

"Please note that I am advancing this argument simply because it was the argument foisted against large-blockers from 2015-2017 and the argument used to justify the ""UASF"" and ""NO2X"" movements.

Small blockers have told us for years (particularly when it seemed like Bitcoin Unlimited was about to get a majority of hashpower) that *total hashpower wasn't enough -- it had to be valid hashpower to matter.* . That is why every user was encouraged to run a ""full node"" - so he could ensure that blocks were valid according to *his* definition of validity.  See [this](https://medium.com/@lopp/securing-your-financial-sovereignty-3af6fe834603) for an example of the dogma.

Fine.  By that definition, BCH is Bitcoin.  QED.",1524821056
"I completely respect what you’re saying, but I disagree. Let me explain my thinking. 

First up, do you really think that someone as obviously brilliant as Satoshi would have released Bitcoin as is and claimed it to be ""electronic cash"", if he thought it could only handle 4 to 7 tps? The evidence is unmistakable that Satoshi always assumed block size would grow organically with demand for block space, and that the block size cap was never intended to limit network growth, but only to prevent DDoS attacks at a time when Bitcoin had little to no economic value. 

So, given what we can deduce from Satoshi's statements, and given what we've been told about large blocks and full node ""centralisation"", how could Satoshi come to these so obviously erroneous conclusions about his network? Well the answer, I think, is that he didn't. This is because the full nodes that become expensive for hobbyists to run on a network with super-large blocks (say 1GB +) only *need* to be run by miners, who we all agree have an economic incentive to maintain the required hardware. That's why Satoshi gives us two other options for non-mining users in the white paper: running a node with pruned merkle trees (section 7) and simplified payment verification, which makes use of the block headers, (section 8). 

On the latter point, contrary to received wisdom it's simply wrong that SPV wallets rely on trusted 3rd parties (full nodes) to verify transactions. SPV nodes verify transactions by linking the hash of transactions to merkle tree / block header. Hence, defrauding an SPV node with to accept a fake transaction would mean finding an astronomically improbable hashing collision.

So, I stand by what I said. Right now, we are more than capable of scaling well beyond the block space needed to support the current demand for economic activity on the network, and there's no reason to think this will not be the case in the future. This was always the proposed design and it has only been disrupted by coders who think it more important that hobbyists can cheaply run their own full nodes, than it is to let the network mature and continue to function as trustless peer-to-peer electronic cash.",1524821046

Your hypothesis that the network will fragment if people run different clients with different rules sort of flies in the face of years of reality that people *are* running different clients with different rules, even miners running highly customized clients, and these splits just don't seem to happen, statistically speaking.  Certainly not in the network-destroying manner you suggest is inevitable.

Every miner can set a different block size limit entirely, and the network still never produce even one ""too-large-block"" orphan.

Full nodes allow you to have more trust in your incoming transactions.  If you set up a PC on Bitcoin, and set it up as a miner, it's almost a sure thing that you will never, ever mine a block, so this is effectively a full-node non-mining block.  (Mining and never being successful is equivalent to not mining, as far as the security of the network goes.)

I think of non-mining nodes as similar to wires.  You need wires (or some communication channel) to run between mining nodes.  Non-mining nodes are a bunch of extra wires on the network.  Some (very few) might be between mining nodes.  Most are just hanging off the edges of the network, adding distance that electrons have to travel.

For those in the mainstream, or those new to crypto, when they encounter or use the term ""Bitcoin"" they think of what it was for its first 8.5 years, before the August 2017 hard fork, and now it gets unfairly conflated with the problems SegWit Bitcoin now has wrought. That's why the ""Bitcoin"" name is still important, and unless we can automatically make everyone aware that the original Bitcoin concept is still alive in BCH (which isn't really feasible), it's important that we keep that part of the name, and even continue to try to garner the official ""Bitcoin"" crown by achieving most cumulative proof of work as well.",1524820152

"We really should stop obsessing about Twitter on-liners. But it's also important to point out the following:

The chain with the highest accumulated proof of work is the authoritative chain, but **only among nodes that follow the same consensus rules.**

Once you have a planned split such that there are two sets of nodes, each set having its own consensus rules, **each set has its own longest authoritative chain**.

At that point we need to distinguish between the two sets of nodes. So we will need a hierarchical system, just like Internet domains. Just as you can have domains bitcoin.org and bitcoin.com, the identical labels ""bitcoin"" being in two different domain hierarchies, so can you have identical coins called Bitcoin, so long as we use some label to distinguish between the two sets of nodes.

So we can call one set of nodes the Core nodes, and another the Cash nodes. And the longest chains can then be called the Bitcoin Core chain and the Bitcoin Cash chain respectively. Within each set of nodes, so long as the context is clear, we can simply refer to the Bitcoin chain without ambiguity. But globally we will want to always use the longer names Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash.**‡**

"If 70% of miners moved started mining invalid blocks, the network would fork into two, and people running full nodes would need to decide which of the two chains they want to take as the real one.

If the majority of merchants decided to remain on the 30% mining one, for example, then the 70% of miners would be wasting their hashing power on a chain that nobody is going to use.

But if merchants (full node users) followed the miners, such that the majority of full nodes were on the 70% hashing power (with changed rules), then this new chain would effectively become Bitcoin, because it's the majority chain.

This is why you shouldn't listen to garbage from the BCash crew where they allege that non-mining nodes are useless. It's not the case. The network majority decides the correct chain via economic incentives and those incentives are not limited to mining. The opposite is kind of true. Merchants need to treat miners as a potentially adverse agent in the network, and should treat every ""invalid"" action by miners as an attack on the network, unless the merchant has previously opted-in to a network change proposal.

I think there certainly can be a UAHF (User activated hard fork), where nodes signal their intent to move onto a specific chain at a particular block height, and if the majority of nodes do opt to change the rules, these new rules become part of the Bitcoin network.

So much of the design depends on all nodes getting exactly identical results in lockstep that a second implementation would be a menace to the network.  The MIT license is compatible with all other licenses and commercial uses, so there is no need to rewrite it from a licensing standpoint.

I disagree with Satoshi on this one, and there are several issues that have come up that have proven this to be an incorrect strategy.  First, the fork March 2013 would have been a non-event if there was not a single dominant piece of code running, and instead, 5-6 implementations and none with more than 30% dominance.

"First, I added an edit to my original comment in case you didn't see it.  

You're right, unless you specifically created multiple seeds (which I'm not even sure if that's a feature Mycelium supports), you'll typically only have one seed on Mycellium. That same see creates all the private keys that control your BTC. The very same private keys control your BCH.  

Yes, to actually access and control your BCH that are currently on your Mycelium seed, you'd need to import that seed into a wallet that can understand the same seed format. I believe Mycelium uses a BIP standard that Electron Cash also understands, but as I mentioned I don't know the exact details. The search function should be your friend here, or hopefully someone else familiar with the process will chime in.  

&gt; Though I think I understand what you're saying. If I use the backup seed from Mycelium, I am not creating a new wallet so everything should be fine?   

Yes, I believe that's the case, although as I mentioned in my edit, it might be safer to actually send your funds to new seeds created only on your new phone if you're planning on getting rid of your old phone. This is just in the small chance that there's no real way to securely wipe the memory of your old phone, and someone that gets it down the road can retrieve (undelete) the original seed.",1524818349

"No he didn't, he called it bitcoin. ",1524817899
"&gt; The lack of an authoritarian center that defines the rules all others must follow is a feature not a bug.

You should try to learn something about bitcoin and how it works. 

All the miners want and must use the same rules.  In particular the max acceptable block size.

The rules unfortunately must change from time to time, as they have changed many times in the past; and all the miners must adopt the changes at the same time, in the same way.  

So how are the changes going to be coordinated?  Satoshi's design did not include any mechanism for that -- and that is one of the fatal flaws of his solution.  

That flaw resulted in the creation of thousands of altcoins, starting with Litecoin in 2010(?); and, starting last August, the forking of his original chain into several persistent branches, including BCH and other less popular coins.  (And someone could even create retroactive forks of the bitcoin chain, in which people's balances are restored as of 5 years ago.)

Such a forkfest did not already start in 2009 only because people were very slow to realize that they could do it.  Up to Aug/2017, bitcoin users and miners, like chickens trapped by a circle drawn on the floor,  sheepishly accepted a **central** authority for rule evolution: first Satoshi, then Gavin, and then Wladimir (nominally, but effectively Greg).  And the latter, backed by the millions of Blockstream and its investors, used every trick that it could and couldn't to keep the chickens inside their circle.  

Among other things, that central authority imposed on all chickens --  users, holders, and miners -- the change to a congested network with a ""fee market"", and the SegWit reformatting -- neither of which was in the interest of the chickens themselves.

In 2017, some chickens realized that the circle was just a drawing, and on 2017-08-01 they walked out.  The old central authority still refusted to accept the schism.  Since they cannot bring back the escaped chickens, they are trying to kill them -- and not always metaphorically.

Back to the issue: if a bunch of people want to use a common cryptocurrency and crypto payment network, they must somehow agree on the rules, and on changes to those rules when they are needed.  

Satoshi's protocol provides distributed consensus on payments among a bunch of people who adopt the same rules; but it cannot create distributed consensus on rule changes.  No one knows how to do that.  Thus, that bunch of people need to accept a central authority and let it decide when and how the rules should change.

That authority could be a committee, but the committee must have a process to reach consensus internally.  

Humanity has developed such mechanisms more than a century ago: that is how the world reaches agreement on character coding tables, C language semantics, the length of the meter, the position of the poles and meridians, the ate and time of day, the assignment of IP numbers, etc.. Namely, they have international committees that debate changes and decide by majority vote.  Those committees have no guns and prisons; but everybody in the world respects their authority, and accepts their decisions.

But of course that time-tested solution is not acceptable to cypherpunks.  It means a global central authority, national representatives, and decision by majority, things that are evil by definition in their funny ideology...

Back to BCH: the coin has a central authority of sorts, consisting of the developers of the three implementations. Unfortunately, it seems that those developers have no consensus mechanism that would result in a clear decision about the rules and rule changes -- not even about such a trivial matter as the block size limit.",1524817879

"I'm not going to give you trading advice because I'm not the greatest trader and end up about as well off as when I don't trade. I do it for fun mostly but I have fucked up massively before and the way to avoid that is risk management.

Take a fixed percentage of your total stack (for me it's 10%) and commit the rest to long storage. If you trade on margin don't risk more than 10% of your trading stack and plan your (stop limits are your friend). A lot of the reason this works is that you will get a better sense of focus growing this smaller stack than reaching into your total bag and eventually loosing everything on double or nothing plays. If you are disciplined with your committed long term and short term stack then the worst thing that could happen is loosing 10%. 

My only other recommendation is to take profit and balance out your trading stack back to 10% if you do well. This locks in profit and keeps you humble. Also it's a good idea to diversity out of crypto if your total stack grows exponentially but I suppose that's broader advice for dealing with risky investments in general.

"I think you just import your backup seed into the new instance of Mycelium on your new phone (I hope someone corrects me if I'm wrong). Make sure to wipe your old phone as securely as possible once the transfer is complete before you dispose of it.  

The seed creates all your private keys, and both the BTC and BCH are controlled by those keys, so once the seed is imported on your new phone, the situation will be just as it is currently on your old phone. If you ever want to spend your BCH before Mycelium implements full BCH usability, you'll need to import that seed into another wallet that supports that process.

"I would urge you to rethink your negative statement about KIN tokens.  I believe they have one of the greatest potentials of all tokens in the entire market...  Here is a long posting that I wrote recently about it, if you have enough free time to look it over.

\-

I apologize up front for typing so much information here, but I feel as though you're missing part of what KIN is and will be.  I'm sure you're a busy person with a life outside of crypto and it's impossible to research everything out there, but I wanted to give you a synopsis of KIN because your statement leads me to believe you haven't taken the time to properly research them and I'm hoping you'll paint it in a better light in the future. 

Okay, so a quick background here: KIK messenger is a popular chat app that you can find on phones like Apple, Samsung, etc. They have 300 million registered users, although I don't know how many of them are active daily.

KIK tested some kind of rewards program several years ago where you could buy digital stickers, give people rewards for posts you liked or if they published songs or apps or something useful, and I believe you could also use them to purchase gift cards.  It was very successful and millions of people used them...

Fast forward to today: KIK created KIN's tokens which ride both Ethereum's network via ERC20, and Stellar's SCP network. They will be used for the same purpose as what I listed above, except in a more official format and for more things. They'll be incorporating KIN tokens into the KIK messenger app so users can earn and spend those tokens. Adding to it, the KIN Rewards Engine \(KRE\) will also be released \(hopefully soon\), which will be an economic incentive for other apps, programs, websites, etc to incorporate KIN tokens as well.

So, what does all of this mean? It honestly means that on the exact same day that KIN is introduced to KIK Messenger and released to the general public that KIN will be the #1 most traded cryptocurrency in the world. I mean, 300\+ million people chatting and have access to KIN tokens just absolutely blows the rest of the entire crypto market out of the water. ...  and ... that's only on the KIK messenger app.  It doesn't even begin to include the KRE SDK they're planning on releasing that will let other software, apps, games, etc include KIN into their programs.

Also, there's been a bit of confusion about them using two different blockchains \(and possibly more in the future\): KIN has decided to run on both Ethereum's network and on Stellar's SCP network. This is to allow for more people to incorporate KIN into their own programs, allows for exchanges to not have to re\-write code to add KIN as a trade\-able asset, allows traders to choose which token they'd prefer to hold, and also eliminates the issue with Ethereum's network being too slow to handle so many millions of transactions per day.  So when you're using or earning KIN in an application, it's easiest to do so using Stellar's SCP network because of the speed and cost of transactions.  When you're selling KIN, it's easier to do so via the ERC20 token because so many exchanges already work with it.

... Sorry for the bombarding of messages here, but to add to it more: If you look at other tokens \(I'm looking at things like Tron\), they don't update or actively work on what they initially said they were going to. The vast majority, probably 90&amp;#37;\+ are nothing but scams.

If you look at KIN's Github page, you can see that their team is very active and constantly working on this project. They are transparent and release the code for everyone to see. Their CEO is doing monthly AMAs as well, which is a nice touch.

I'm not trying to just shill you on how great KIN is for no reason. I truly look at this as a real project with a real\-world application and value and it's mind\-boggling to me that so few people know about it.  KIN and KIK both have issues as well, but then again which project doesn't?

I really hope you'll reconsider your view on KIN or give me a reason to reconsider my view of it.

"Like others said, buy some eth/btc. DONT buy in one go too. If you want to spend 200 dollar in crypto, spend 100 dollar now, invest in btc or eth. Then read first how to secure your coins. Try NOT to use online wallets. I prefer desktop wallets and hardware wallet. 

Make an account at ALL exchanges, not just Binance (which is by far the best exchange). Just make an account, you never know if you'd need it. 

Read a lot too. Just use coinmarketcap to see which coins are out there. I'd say read all about the top 30 coins. Read them all. See what excites you. But:

Don't invest after 5 minutes of research. REALLY research the shit out of the coin, including negative stuff (enter -coinname- fud in google for example). Don't believe YouTubers! A lot of them are either paid or just bought the coin and what to sell it (to you) for a profit. Don't believe a lot what you read here on Reddit either - although (!) You do get pitched a lot of great coins here and it's definitely worth checking them out so now and then (that's how I got xrb when it was 50 cents which I sold at $20, thank you reddit!). 

Buy in steps and take profit in steps. Don't buy 100% in one go of the coin you want. Just wait a few days and buy more. And TAKE PROFIT, if you made decent profit then take it. 

While hype is fun and adrenaline rushing, DONT get caught up with it too much, it will blur your vision and can make you do stupid things (FOMO). That's how you lose money. 

My personal strategy of investing (not gambling!) is not following hype or trying to ride waves, but investing in projects I believe in, then just waiting out till it pops. As a lot of people feel a bullrun is in coming, I think this will be the best strategy.

* Core was perfectly fine with big blocks UNTIL they got into bed with banks/investors via Blockstream
* Blockstream; the organisation employing Core developers and co-founded by Core developers, received funding of at least $76 million
* 7 of the top 10 developers of Bitcoin Core work for Blockstream and Chaincode
* Censorship is used to manipulate consensus and the CEO of Blockstream let it slip that deploying astroturfing and shilling is routine.
* An event like Core's coup d'etat is unlikely to occur with Bitcoin Cash, as it has multiple developer teams working independently.
* CoreStream players didn't create Bitcoin (didn't even help create it). Once they pushed out the real developers they turned Bitcoin into a profitability scheme.",1524815580

I guess my only quibble there would be that it establishes BCH as ""valid Bitcoin"" instead of ""valid Bitcoin Cash"". It's fair to claim BCH is Bitcoin by almost all *other* criteria (for instance, just about everything in Satoshi's white paper), but saying it's Bitcoin because of ""valid"" rules that have been vetted by Nakamoto Consensus would be a false contention (for now). I'm still waiting for and anticipating the ""Cashening"", so this concern is hopefully short-term and will eventually be moot.",1524813362

"&gt;I'd argue it *had* a case. That ship sailed, though, when it failed to pull a majority of users away from BTC.

pow majority does NOT define bitcoin. also roger fails to understand it. When bitcoin forks to exceed 21 Mill and that firk gets pow majority, it is still NOT bitcoin. likewise bcash wouldn't be bitcoin even if having majority pow.",1524813304
"Nice! Thanks for the insight. I had a similar thought when I found out xlm would be implementing lightning.

"Still wrong though. An incompatible chain with greater PoW would still not be Bitcoin as old nodes would not reach consensus with it. People might get away with calling it Bitcoin, but that's just like the difference between physical possession and rightful ownership.",1524813190

"Exactly. ""Nick Szabo is Satoshi!!!!! He created Bit Gold!11!1""

Didn't know that the whitepaper said ""Bitcoin : electronic peer to peer gold""",1524813094
"Bitcoin is a protocol and that protocol can change. One of the suggestions by Satoshi Nakamoto was that the maximum size of a block could just be increased if we needed more space. Increasing the block size is a hard fork, there's no way to increase the block size and have older Bitcoin implementations recognize those blocks as valid. Personally, as a programmer as well I tend to think of the definition of Bitcoin as defined in every Bitcoin implementation. There's a strict set of rules that blocks must conform to to be considered Bitcoin. One of the reasons why Bitcoin Cash proponents claim that Bitcoin Cash deserves to be called Bitcoin is that although their fork is incompatible with other Bitcoin implementations, it's in the spirit of the Bitcoin whitepaper by increasing the maximum block size as opposed to Segregated Witness which is what Bitcoin Core and other Bitcoin implementations settled on. Segregated Witness does not increase the size of a block directly but it kind of does in a roundabout way. SegWit basically moves part of the transaction into a separate part of the block that doesn't count towards that 1MB limit. A SegWit block is a soft fork, and like it or not it's a brilliant hack regardless of which side of the debate you're on. To an older Bitcoin implementation, SegWit blocks are still totally valid Bitcoin blocks that meet all of the constraints for a block.

The gist of the disagreement is that while Bitcoin Cash isn't the original project that Satoshi started, it is arguably following the original Bitcoin whitepaper published a decade ago. People also claim that what is now Bitcoin Core was taken over but I'd suggest that you look way back in the commit history on that repo yourself and you'll see quite a few familiar names. The people leading Bitcoin Core are some of the same people who worked with Satoshi himself. The Gregory Maxwell you see referenced in those early commits is the same Gregory Maxwell who is now the CTO and co-founder of Blockstream.",1524813093

I don't like anybody who foams at the mouth about it being the true Bitcoin or whatever but I do welcome free market competition. If they can get more support and adoption and eventually obtain more proof of work then it's possible that someday it could be the true Bitcoin. I personally doubt it but the point of crypto has never been to strangle each other.,1524813061

No. Bitcoin is the longest PoW chain and calling a cat a bitcoin won't make that cat a bitcoin. Therefore people can't call whatever they want bitcoin.

You mean like getting paid if you make a transfere? /s

Transaction fees have a purpose and if you would think it over: it is a essential part of this system.
We have a price discovery that is depending on the cost of maintaining the system, which itself is still developing.
Maintaining the system is being paid by fees and btc rewarded (this later is for 'now').
