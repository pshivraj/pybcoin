"Adoption of cryptocurrency in place of FIAT begins with liquidity. 

The more options there are to **trade** purely in crypto, the more liquidity will enter the market and off the exchanges.

IOW, it starts to become unnecessary to use FIAT to buy crypto.

Then, the **only** barriers are insane price fluctuations and wallet software.

The latter is fairly trivial to solve - the former, heh, well, this is the true barrier to adopting cryptocurrency as a means of trade of goods and services.

Right now, XVG is ridiculously early on this - it amounts to a paid shill  - but if XVG had enough liquidity, IOW, enough people out there with wallets of XVG, buying and selling, then the barriers come right down.

A super simple mobile wallet with some 2FA tech, public keys are obscured etc.

I'd never for a moment suggest that XVG will ever realise this, clearly not, but there's plenty of coins out there working on just this, as we all know.

But this leads to all sorts of other problems, the least of which just how many different competing currencies could there be? How fragmented could the market become?",1524034727

"yes, because of this kiddy hatred between btc and bch none of them is picked. Hell, it is the reason some people don't even bother anymore about bitcoin. On the one side you have zealots and on the other martyrs. Who do I choose? Ethereum, to buy Nano and verge and fuck those cults.

Think of it: Some side wheel Dogecoin managed to get a better partnership than the first crypto currency. 

And the only reason bitcoin will now gain momentum is because you need it to buy verge. Because people will buy this so called ""shitcoin"" to pay for porn. And in the mean time I still can't pay shit in germany with bitcoin.

You want bitcoin to succeed? Get a product my mother can use after watching me using it once and some marketing guys who will get some partnerships. Until then all crypto is just nerdcoin.

"I keep seeing comments in investment/finance subs talking about how every crypto trader is an idiot because stock traders have been doing this for years without problems.

What they fail to mention is stock traders ... even high volume traders...typically have an actual direct Fiat cost basis to track their investment against. And for the most part, when the average investor makes a trade...it's either for Fiat or for something with direct Fiat value. Not to mention robust trading platforms that due the tax calcs for everyone automatically.

Crypto is closest to Forex trading or derivative/swap trading...but the platforms and professionals they trade through already have decades of pressidence to calculate and send investors a tidy, straight forward printout of their tax obligation each year....or at least some basis to do it manually. And the average inexperienced Joe investor doesn't even have access to those more complicated investment vehicles.

It's not surprising so many people are screwed on this. Kind of a shame ",1524033584
"To be completely honest I can see now why the guy actually said this would be one of the biggest things in crypto. Think about it.  The payment process is just as shit &amp; useless as Bitcoin. i.e nobody uses crypto for payments &amp; never will as long as it's this ""complicated"". However, when you think about the fact that Mindgeek or whatever the company name was, is actually listing Verge as a payment option on all of their sites. That's huge. Nobody will use it (just like Bitcoin), but the daily exposure is huge. Sure there's a lot to do and again I really doubt Verge will be used for payments but in the bigger picture this is definitely big for crypto.

Just makes me wonder does anybody even care about the actual currency part? I mean I sure as hell don't and don't see anybody else either. What is crypto right now? To me, it's more profitable version of speculative gambling to gather more fiat.",1524033512

"I will agree asking for donations for a partnership is very odd. that is one reason why i still won't ever buy verge. Simply on principle, that feels very odd to me. Most cryptos as a whole is already really hard to deal with. It involves coinbase, verfication and new tax laws that is simply overwhelming to the current average investor. Verge can't really fix most of that. The best they can do is get people to talk about crypto more. This ""partnership"" has definitely done that. Those who are really interested, will learn the difficulties navigating crypto. It'll take take for the entire crypto market to be more user friendly.",1524033404

the bit about coinbase and bnb should also be done away with in the future. imagine a bank that offers a crypto address as a possible target of your bank transfer, with a dropdown for the type of coin. at some point this will happen. the fact that it's not there yet can't be pinned on verge IMO.

"**Elephant Memory Systems**

Elephant Memory Systems (EMS) was a popular brand of floppy disk media produced by Leading Edge in the 1980s. The name for the product was suggested by Ray Welch to company owner Michael Shane because of the common folk wisdom that an elephant never forgets.

The brand was originally devised as an inexpensive, mass-market product. Its imposing pachyderm logo, designed by Rollin Binzer was often paired with bright orange or yellow and black packaging, which was in stark contrast of the more conservative silvers and blues used by competitors like IBM. Shane's advisers feared this would undermine the credibility of the product.

"I see what you're trying to get at, but it's really not the takeaway you should have if you care about adoption even a little bit. I couldn't care less about Verge and probably won't touch it. But it doesn't matter if this is a disastrous failure in the long term, or if it does anything for the price of Verge. It matters that hundreds of millions of people are being exposed to crypto that may not have been before.

Forbes, Wired, Gizmodo, The Verge (no relation to the currency obviously), Complex, Hypebeast, Mashable, in addition to many others, all ran stories covering the partnership. That's an audience of over 100 million alone, not including shares, retweets, etc. Add on to that the 150 million+ daily users on Pornhub being shown the new temporary logo and announcement ads; plus there's the other Mindgeek network affiliates (Brazzers, who ran a Stormy Daniels plug - you think there won't be stories on this with all she's involved in right now?).

I actually laughed at you thinking any holder of any currency could have the right to be ""embarrassed"" by ""having their portfolio thrown into the porn business."" 1 - you don't get to dictate what a decentralized blockchain or crypto does. 2 - Get out of the 1950's man, 80-90% of people watch porn.

"Reported mine as realized capital gains / losses.

I read into this a lot, and the consensus among most accountants from my point of view was that like-kind exchanges were not a  real option for crypto to crypto trades. 

I agree, it is a bit ridiculous given the massive volatility in crypto like the crash we saw recently, but if that's the way the IRS sees it, then i'm doing it their way. I figured  I might as well pay and if crypto to crypto trades are one day established as like-kind exchanges i'll file an amended return and get a nice refund if at all possible.

For now though, I really, really don't want to be audited and I figure if the IRS wants a reason to audit cryptocurrency users, they're going to start with those that tried to pull a fast one on them and claim ""like kind exchanges"". 

It does really  suck for some though. For example, if there was someone who bought $10,000 of  XBY tokens when they were at $0.05, then (When they grew to $0.75/token) traded them for DeepBrainChain tokens at their peak &amp;  continued to hold throughout the crash. That's $140,000 of taxable short-term gains which they would likely have 0 of. They'd barely have their first $10,000. ",1524031819

ZEN has &gt;2x in USD value since the beginning of April and was briefly in the Top 100 on CMC.

"&gt; Incorrect. Blockchain bloat is the problem because

&gt; ... to validate a block you MUST validate every single transaction. Otherwise miners could put bogus txs in every block, and everyone else would just accept it. Not how it works.
 
&gt; You DO need to get the whole chain.

This makes absolutely no sense, because the transaction hashes still need to match the Merkle leaf hashes, which are then hashed into the Merkle branches (sometimes referred to as nodes), which are then hashed into the Merkle root.

I suggest that if you want a deeper understanding of Merkle Trees, then you I suggest you read BIP 98 (To change the Merkle Tree structure and apply more instructions while also optimizing) which does an extremely good job explaining what the Merkle Trees do in relation to Bitcoin.

https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0098.mediawiki

Basically, you would need to find a SHA-256 collision to be able to spoof a bogus transaction into a Merkle Tree.

&gt;&gt; Though even now a miner can just ask for a copy of the UTXO set and recent blocks from anyone with a pruned node and run off of that with a custom implementation.
&gt; 
&gt; And here you slip on that giant banana peel... yes, that is something you can do, IF YOU TRUST THE MINER. That is, you are implicitly assuming a TRUSTED setup, giving up trustlessness, one of the key feature of Bitcoin.
&gt; 
&gt; If that's the compromise you are willing to make, having to rely on trusted counterparties, then life is much easier, sure. But I'm not willing to do that.

There is no trust needed here, you would know if you received a bogus transaction, because it wouldn't hash into the Merkle Tree. 

You would also know if you have the complete UTXO set, because you know based on block number, exactly *to the Satoshi,* how many coins are supposed to be in circulation.

[Merkle Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) are one of the least understood things about Bitcoin, but also one of the most useful.

&gt;&gt; 2MB = ~105 GB per year of transactions per year.
&gt; 
&gt; Exactly.. and the current blockchain is ~150GB, so 100GB increases the blockchain by ~66%.
&gt; 
&gt; Which outpaces tech improvements.

No. If you're really stating it's only 150 GB because that's all the mining pools can handle, then you're being extremely disingenuous. 

Your mental gymnastics are insane.

&gt;&gt; Because you're intellectually lazy.
 
&gt; You are missing the point, not putting in the effort to understand it, AND calling me intellecutally lazy. Then you do some calculations to prove your point. And yet, you are missing the point.
 
You really are missing the point, this whole second portion is just a ""what if someone wanted to actually keep the whole blockchain, even though it's unnecessary?""
 
&gt; All the improvements you mention, (SSD cost, 5G, and more) is ALREADY INCLUDED IN MY CLAIMS.

Well, then there's something wrong with how you came to your conclusion, because as I outlined, the hardware is available do 1 GB blocks today.

&gt; Proof: Moore's law gives you a calculation performance increase of ~60% per year. Nielsen's law gives you a broadband speed increase of ~50% per year. These two laws have stood the test of time, and I'm assuming that they are VALID. And, interestingly, there were no significant deviations from them, down OR up.
&gt; 
&gt; Hence, 5G and CPU speed + software optimization improvements are already built in. And no, categorically no, we will not assume faster improvements over these two laws.
&gt; 
&gt; So what now? Well, to your own calculation, with 2MB blocks the blockchain will increase ~66% in the first year!
&gt; 
&gt; 66% &gt; 60% --&gt; Blockchain growth beats Moore law
&gt; 
&gt; 66% &gt; 50% --&gt; Blockchain growth beats Nielsen's law.
&gt; 
&gt; Conclusion: Blockchain growth outpaces tech improvements.

And yet even Satoshi said Bitcoin could do ""much larger than"" Visa levels of transaction amounts in 2009, with the hardware available at the time, 9 whole years ago.

&gt;The existing Visa credit card network processes about 15 million Internet purchases per day worldwide.  Bitcoin can already scale much larger than that with existing hardware for a fraction of the cost.  It never really hits a scale ceiling.

&gt;http://plan99.net/~mike/satoshi-emails/thread1.html

That you don't understand who this could be possible today, means that you're being intellectually lazy, because you don't care to find out how this could even be possible.

If you really think this would be impossible today, show me figures, hard data, and research. 

It shouldn't be too hard seeing how strong your convictions are.",1524031695

"Nothing you say is wrong, however it also doesn't invalidate a single thing I said.

Yes, some coins appreciate faster and you can trade in and out of them to increase your holdings of currencies you want to have (whether that be BTC, USD, or whatever else).  This is **pumping** (buying in, increasing the price) and **dumping** (selling out again, getting what you really want).  Therefore what you're describing *is the very definition* of pump and dump whether you like that term or not.

Regarding my second comment about the technology.  You're right that there are coins that have some desirable properties that BTC doesn't.  They also have some very undesirable properties that BTC doesn't.  For me, the phrase ""the technology must be better"" implies not only some new advantages, but that either those advantages significantly outweigh any new disadvantages (at best, no new disadvantages).  Such a alt-coin does not yet exist in my opinion.

"No idea. Let me guess...

64 bytes is enough to store a SHA512. 32 a SHA256. So wth 96 bytes you can already pretty much more than guarantee the integrity of a file. Now let's add more bytes for a magnetic URI (bit torrent) or something and you'll see 220 bytes is plenty for decentralised storage of anything (assuming there's always a torrent seed) and verification forever of the existence of some sort of electronic media that can be hashed.

Look at this example of a Magneti URI on Wikipedia, which even includes additional links to torrent trackers which are not needed but can help locate files quicker:-

&lt;magnet:?xt=urn:ed2k:354B15E68FB8F36D7CD88FF94116CDC1
&amp;xt=urn:tree:tiger:7N5OAMRNGMSSEUE3ORHOKWN4WWIQ5X4EBOOTLJY

&amp;xs=http%3A%2F%2Fcache.example.org%2FXRX2PEFXOOEJFRVUCX6HMZMKS5TWG4K5
&amp;xs=dchub://example.org&gt;

That's still only 428 bytes as text, and for sure can be stored more compressed in hex form.

If you need to use anything close to 220 bytes to do what you want to do it smells of bad design. Bitcoin (Cash) blockchain is NOT a storage system cause that won't work and there are existing systems better designed for that using things such as Proof of Data Possession, but they suck as electronic cash.  In our lifetimes perhaps a person will have 1 petabyte of storage requirements, obviously this cannot scale, however 220 byte OP_RETURNS for sure will be able to, for example if you pay you could hash every single piece of digital media you own - forever.",1524029703

"&gt; Predatory bubbles still exist all over the economy. Student loans, auto loans, credit card debt, bond market, stock market.

&gt; The fact that you think I'm suggesting we ""remove"" the financial system entirely is a complete mis-characterization of my point.

Earlier you were describing the dangers of ""predatory bubbles"" in the economy.  I guess you are saying that the bubbles are entirely caused by the Fed.  Specifically, the Fed ALWAYS solves problems with low-interest rates?

&gt; Just because people need loans, doesn't mean an artificially low interest rate is ALWAYS beneficial or necessarily encourages sound, productive investments.

That's simply not how the Fed works.  If you look back at 1979 and 1980, the federal funds rate reached a high of 20%, which was to combat inflation.  That's called contractionary polity.  They don't always lower interest rates. 
 In fact, they are starting to rise.  Let me know if that's too dense for you.

You keep bringing up bubbles and the threat they cause.  You seem to be associating them with the Federal Reserve entirely blaming them for causing bubbles.  You probably think that without the Fed we wouldn't have price bubbles, and Bitcoin fixes this problem.  What do you think happened last year when Bitcoin reach $20,000 and then since crashed?  Isn't that (gasp) a bubble?

The job of the federal reserve is to stabilize the economy.  It's not perfect, but it does a pretty damn good job.

"Thank you!  

Looks like a few devs started putting things out this month.  This is actual, measurable code that I'm looking forward to checking out.  I appreciate you providing the link.  I also found and was able to run a [node daemon](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases).

Both projects reference implementing based on ""[BOLT](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc)s"", which is a new specification set that I'm not sure is affiliated with the whitepaper.  

The 2+ year-old whitepaper has stagnated and still lists itself a draft.  The brand-new BOLT specs look like they're still being modified, and also claim to be in-progress drafts.  While there does appear to be some recent code, it all connects to a separate testnet and there's no indication it's capable of connecting or running on real crypto.  Seems pretty suspicious that after 2-3 years of promises and millions in VC, this is all we have.

Anyway, looks like I have some more to look into.  Thanks again for providing the info I asked for.",1524028196

"You could download on either iPhone or Mac. Do a bit of research on these forums for a wallet or even on Google. You will find a few options.

In the normal day to day banks do actually protect you from credit card theft. This is core issue of bitcoin. Bitcoin CANNOT protect your funds, if they are stolen they are gone.

Usually high risk businesses use 3ds anyways to prevent or lower the risk of chargebacks.

Copped some flack recently because of the exchange issues but people need to remember it isn't an ERC20 or bitcoin fork. It has a product.

&gt;To evade control [read: attacks] from government regulators, mining cartels, and other adversaries, the system should strive to remain maximally decentralized, avoiding single points of failure or control. In order to preserve decentralization, system requirements to participate should be kept low.

This doesn't follow. In fact, staying small and ""decentralized"" (an overly vague term in this context; what network topology exactly? The goal is robustness against attack, not maximum flatness) leaves Bitcoin more vulnerable to attack because the cost to attack remains low as adoption sights are set very low.

A low barrier to entry ensured by throttling adootion makes for less robustness against attack than a relatively higher barrier to entry caused by letting adoption happen at its natural exponential pace, as the latter path brings more total miners into the fold and also vastly raises rhe threshold for government attack.

"&gt;Opponents to a block size argue that increasing the block size limit is unimaginative

How imaginative a solution is to a problem is not an engineering concern. It is a concern for speculative investors who feel that the harder a solution is for them to understand the more ""cutting edge"" it is and the more brilliant the developers are for being able to understand it. I work as a professional software engineer and one of our guiding principles in engineering is that all else being equal, choose the simpler solution.  

In this case, the unimaginativeness of the solution to increase the block size is because it is the simpler solution to scaling that has been employed for the entirety of Bitcoin's existence and which is outlined in the white paper.

&gt;offers only temporary relief

Before the blocks got full Bitcoin transactions were growing at a rate of roughly 70% per year. Increasing the blocks even a little bit would have bought many years for BTC to experiment with alternative scaling mechanisms should they have been required. It is wholly unacceptable for a 9 year old network to just shut down the way BTC did until very recently due to outrageously high fees (an average of $55 in December).

&gt;and damages decentralization by increasing costs of participation

Often claimed but never proven. This claim usually means, with smaller blocks more full-nodes will be used, but the links between full-node usage and blocksize, and blocksize and full-node usage are tenuous at best. Ethereum is the counter-example to the latter point. With bigger blocks, a greater number of transactions, and no one in Ethereum pushing the preposterous line that you absolutely must run a full-node, otherwise you might as well be using PayPal,  Ethereum has a higher node count than Bitcoin. Intuitively an uncongested network you can transact on frequently provides more motivation to run a full-node than does an congested network where transactions are sparing.

&gt;Additionally, introducing a social/technical process for a hard fork risks that very same process becoming a future attack vector within Bitcoin. 

This is just subterfuge. Segwit was, if anything, a more dramatic change than raising the blocksize limit was. Soft-forking it in just meant that clients lost the ability to understand what was going on with certain transactions unless they upgraded. It didn't mean they had any real say as to whether they wanted to accept Segwit into the network. Normalizing radical coercive changes like Segwit just means that any time the devs can find a convoluted hacky way to sneak some enormous change into the ecosystem as a soft-fork, they can do this without needing to achieve as broad of a consensus as they would in the case of a hard-fork. They can be very sneaky as soft-forks don't require the entire network to upgrade the way hard forks do.

&gt;Small blockers argue that effort should instead be spent optimizing use of the block space we already have. They favor scaling solutions that push transactions off chain, and have no problem being patient while they are developed.

And big blockers and moderates think this is incredibly short-sighted because it [loses Bitcoin users to altcoins](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/7l6n63/the_problem_with_vers_position/drk4izl/) and erodes Bitcoin's network affect. Why buy Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency whose devs are more than happy to make the network completely unusable, when you can buy another cryptocurrency with a dev team committed to having it always be useful for commerce?

&gt;Small blockers believe Bitcoin‚Äôs main value proposition is its censorship-resistant nature and ability to minimize needed trust. They contend that these properties can only come from a Bitcoin that cannot be controlled. To evade control [read: attacks] from government regulators, mining cartels, and other adversaries, the system should strive to remain maximally decentralized, avoiding single points of failure or control. In order to preserve decentralization, system requirements to participate should be kept low. 

You can participate in Bitcoin very cheaply at any blocksize by verifying your own transactions using SPV. This is what most people do with BTC as well as BCH. Moreover, the average person will never run a node no matter how small the blocks are, so it's symptomatic of Core's detachment from normal Bitcoin users that they think letting the fees skyrocket to out of control levels is okay if the fringe users who would like to run a node can run a node for the cost of one Bitcoin transaction.

&gt;To understand this, consider an extreme example: very big blocks (1GB+) would require data center level resources to validate the blockchain. This would preclude all but the wealthiest individuals from participating. A low barrier to entry preserves the ability for individuals and small parties to participate fully in the network, without needing trusted third parties. 

BU did some testing a while back where they found that 1TB blocks could be verified with consumer-grade hardware. Can you describe to me more what you imagine is preventing people from verifying 1GB+ blocks? Internet speeds? I get a 1GBPS fibre-optic internet connection where I am for cheap. Even if we, implausibly assumed that say 10GB blocks were uncompressed, I could download a block in 80s and verify the block in some reasonable amount of time assuming the client had some of the improvements the various Bitcoin Cash teams are working on for such large blocks, such as multithreaded verifications.",1524019909

After copying/pasting some old patches he accidentally hard forked his own coin. Yep... This is pure craziness and people here are just waiting to watch this coin disappear for good.

Let us examine these claims one at a time.

\&gt;It‚Äôs just a clone of some other coins \(copy paste code\) but most importantly the dev says that‚Äôs it‚Äôs private and anonymous while this is absolutely *not the case*.

True. Verge does not offer privacy in any sense of the word at the present time. The code is also most definitely copied. Big chunks of the code is exactly the same as the code for other coins.

\&gt;This guy \(Justin V.\) is a con artist and has been arrested around 30 times by the way.

Over\-exaggeration. He has been arrested 8 times though. This clearly shows poor judgement.

\&gt;Last week there was a hack where millions of Verges were ‚Äúmined‚Äù every second. Justin was unable to provide a solution. After copying/pasting some old patches he accidentally hard forked his own coin.

Absolutely true. He copied two year old code from another coin. This is available for anyone to see in the Verge commit history. The hacker did mine million of coins.

Here lately there is this tendency of shunning anyone talking about other things that deviates from the line of ""adoption"" or repeating the obvious, that r/bitcoin is junk.

Adoption is *key*, but it is far away and survival now matters. Reality also matters, 99.999% of people getting into crypto want to have a go in something that might be the future and will increase in value. Why ICOs are such a craze? Because people want to invest in the next google. What is wrong with that? Nothing, if you ask me. But some BCH folks will come over to point a finger and say you want to make money fast and not change the world. I find it sort of fanatic and also wrong.

Roger Ver used to talk about the value of BCH increasing, now it seems that it is frowned upon.

As a BCH supporter and as someone who has coins, I really wish to see all the good things the platform can do coming into reality. Better Zconf Tx and tokens. BCH has an **huge** potential for tokenization because it can do it without hurting the money properties.

"&gt; Im not sure the new p2p loaning system would actually be more beneficial than the current banks and loan system

Neither am I, at least not completely. There are reasons to think it would be.

&gt; You also don't have to keep your money in the banks if you don't want to.

It doesn't matter if your money is under your mattress. The second more money is created out of thin air it still loses buying power. You're still part of any system as long as you own its currency.

&gt; You act like more bitcoin won't one day be pulled out of thin air.

That's because it won't be pulled out of thin air. There will only ever be 21 Million bitcoins ever created and that's it. Forks fall into the category of competing cryptocurrencies. There is Ethereum, Litecoin, and over a thousand others, but they're still not creating anymore bitcoins.

&gt; By definition, whoever has power is ""the man"". Who ""the man"" is what really changes. Percentages don't matter much.

I don't get your point.

&gt; You assume the power over currency will go to ""the people"" maybe? Thats why you think maybe the man will from 100% power to 60% power? That's not how the world has been shown to work.

You're not actually making any points. You're just making an assertion in stating ""that's not how the world has been shown to work"".

&gt; In reality, all that will happen is that a new group of people will eventually rise to take the power that currently is controlled by the banks. The only thing that will have changed is who ""the man"" is.

Incorrect. There is tremendous power in being able to create money out of thin air. It's an implicit tax on everyone holding the currency and it leads to accumulation of wealth for those with this power and their contacts. Bitcoin destroys this power so that nobody has it. It's a move in the right direction in terms of making sure there is no accumulation of undue currency printing power.

&gt; All is said is we will take power away from the banks, who is ""the man"" currently. Do you agree eventually there will be a group that will have power over fiat?

I don't understand what you're asking.

&gt; Because you provide zero evidence one would be better than the other. All you do is bash the current system.

I'm not saying ""one would be better than the other"". I'm saying if we're talking about the ability to print money out of thin air, then nobody will have this undue power. It's a step towards more fairness but not a complete solution, by any means.

&gt; In reality, we do have power over our fiat and our banking system, at least int he US we do. It's called voting.

We have power over fiat and the power to not rely on fiat. There are some people who want something less prone to manipulation and that would make it impossible to print money out of thin air. I see bitcoin as one way in which we're exercising control over fiat... by abandoning it to some extent.",1524018247

Brick and mortar stores might be more inclined to convert to fiat, as they have to pay for utilities and leasing - more overhead costs. If these folds were to hold crypto only during a crash, then they could potentially lose their business.

Vitalik Buterin was pointing to a book in his recent tweets ""Debt: The First 5,000 Years"", you should read it, it provides insights in history as to why certain things get adopted as money.  There are plenty of examples in history where money can just be a backing store of value that never even moves so even the argument that Bitcoin is slow is a weak one.

"**Externality**

In economics, an externality is the cost or benefit that affects a party who did not choose to incur that cost or benefit. Economists often urge governments to adopt policies that ""internalize"" an externality, so that costs and benefits will affect mainly parties who choose to incur them.

For example, manufacturing activities that cause air pollution impose health and clean-up costs on the whole society, whereas the neighbors of individuals who choose to fire-proof their homes may benefit from a reduced risk of a fire spreading to their own houses. If external costs exist, such as pollution, the producer may choose to produce more of the product than would be produced if the producer were required to pay all associated environmental costs.

"&gt; Do you have any criticism on my logic?

Yes, a significant amount, because it is erroneous.

&gt; Doesn't it bother you that someone who advocates for equality enforces a rule which on the surface looks like it helps equality but it actually doesn't?

There's two big problems with that setence.  First, you are claiming it has been proven that whatever it is you think he is advocating for hurts whatever cause you think he's advocating.  The fact that social democracies in Europe with significantly high social welfare programs rate higher in health, wealth, and happiness, would seem to disprove your notions.  So if you're going to make the claim you're making, you need to first more clearly define what it is, and then provide the logic and data to support it.  Right now, you're just asserting your vague notions as true.

Secondly, even if we took your claim as true, that would still not mean there is any reason to be upset.  A voluntaryist society allows for people -- and groups of people -- to team together and have their own political leanings and operate in whatever fashion they want.  If some group of people want to interact in a way you don't like, they're free to do it, as long as they don't impose anything on you.  Which is exactly what is happening here.  He is hosting an event, privately, and inviting who he wants for the price he wants.  That is his choice and does not impact you in any way.  If you're upset because you think he is attempting to sway peoples' political opinions in a way you don't like, you are free to host your own event and charge whatever prices you want to explain to people why he's wrong.

&gt; This has nothing to do with all the bad things you're accusing me of.

The only thing I accused you of is not being as pro-freedom as you think you are.  I still stand by that claim and still believe it to be accurate.

&gt; I am upset because many people fall for this. This is a basic economic concept https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality

If you're going to talk about externalities, you're going to be in a world of hurt, because there's about a bajillion more significant externalities than the cost of the slight sway in political views that the price of Andreas's event might cause.  There's also the fact that externalities are not black and white -- for example, if Bitcoin could scale to Visa-level number of transactions on-chain with only 50kb blocks, we'd all be fine with ""paying"" for that externality.  So we're OK with some amount of externalities, as long as we don't view them as too costly relative to their benefit to society at large.  Add to that the fact that there's plenty of valid arguments and data to show that it's not possible to live without externalities of some kind (√† la ""no man is an island"").

And then on top of all that, you're implicitly claiming that anybody who's famous has an obligation to alter their behavior so as to not potentially influence others, which is crazy and unfair in its own right.",1524012866

Do you agree that the probability that he solves the _next_ block is equal to his fraction of the hash rate, alpha?""  

He retorted: ""Well that's sort of true but its really just an approximation. You're not looking at the problem from the proper perspective of IDDs.""  

I replied back ""What's an IDD?""

He laughed to himself again, this time louder, and told me that he thought my math skills were better than what I was presenting to him.  He said IDDs are ""processes that are independent and identically distributed.""  

I replied back: ""Oh, you mean like how mining is memoryless, right?  Yeah, I understand processes like that.  So OK forget about the hidden block, do you agree that the probability that the selfish miner finds the _next_ block is equal to alpha?""  

And again he would say something like ""Peter, you obviously don't understand IDDs and negative binomials, but I have a paper coming out soon that will help to understand what I'm saying.""  And I'm thinking to myself that he hasn't actually said _anything at all_.

The conversation went nowhere for a while like this with him dropping technobabble terms like it was going out of style.

"How do we even know that Waltonchain is involved in this for sure?
Xiamen Zhongchuan IOT Industry Development Co., Ltd was formed in 2014, Waltonchain was formed late 2016 by members of the Silicon chip company just as the altcoin boom had started boomin.

Now this is just a theory but wouldn't it be possible that the members of a small chip company saw crypto booming and decided that they wanted a peace of the cake so they formed Waltonchain foundation and claimed Silicon and Xiamen Zhongchuan IOT Industry Development were subsidiaries of Waltonchain Foundation, even though Waltonchain is younger than both of these companies. Here is the organizational chart of Waltonchain as they claim it to be: https://i.redd.it/6f5uqtdk6j001.jpg. We had to wait for a while for that chart.

China has a history of financial scams so i don't see this as too far stretched. They could easily lie to western investors and they would never get in trouble for it,""The China Hustle"".

If there are major holes in my tinfoil hat theory, please point them out.

Some red flags:

* Everything is closed source, we don't know if they are making much development.
* They delayed main net so they could launch with 6 child chains active but they launched with 0. The one child chain that is known and being worked on, Freyerchain seems to be located in the same building as Waltonchain.
* Everyone is mining on a chain where the tokens can't be traded because the token swap hasn't happened, there was a leak with the miner and a few people got to premine some coins on **really** low difficulty.
* When token swap comes, people with Guardian Masternodes on Hardware wallets have to extract the private key from the hardware wallet (rendering it unsafe) if they don't want to lose their ""guardian status"" since apparently the new token shares the same private key with your erc20 tokens. They could not come up with a better way?
* I don't think that there have been any big partnerships that have actually been confirmed by the other party and if there is some confirmation it is from subsidiaries and surprisingly not the parent company.
* Both China Mobile IoT Alliance and Alibaba Cloud were hyped as biggest partnerships in crypto history but nothing has been heard of either one since announcement, Alibaba Cloud tweet was even deleted shortly after.
* Some of the knights left late last year and accused the team of being ""unethical"" and hinted that some of the partnerships don't exist, those partnerships were removed from the website and haven't been heard of since. Knights are a ""bridge between the team and the community"".
* they can't even code a proper website.

Red flags i'm copy pasting from other people because i'm lazy:

* For the co-founder who is supposed to be the VP of supply chain of Septwolves, there‚Äôs no record of him at all working there ever. People called the company and they said they never heard of him. Apparently they [released this photo to the media](https://i.redd.it/bwy6nghfb8qz.jpg), which doesn‚Äôt prove anything but that he went there and took a photo in front of the building. They initially had Septwolves as a ‚Äúpartner‚Äù on their site, but have since taken it down.
* Poorly written whitepaper. Some of may be a language issue (but then again a professional company that is serious would have hired a native English writer to translate), but even the formatting and text alignment is messed up. Not to mention the vague descriptions and meaningless marketing jargon.

1. He own several of the most important channels where new people look for guidance: This sub, bitcoin.com etc He has lot of power.

2. He is a big investor is 25% of the important crypto companies. Most, if not all of these companies are promoting bch, or not implementing things like segwit and batching. He is maybe the most powerful man in the industry.

3. He admitted many times that he bought a lot of BCH futures before the fork and he is among the biggest bch holders.

But Bitcoin Core is really killing it hard ... they are so hostile towards everybody and have driven all adoption away. what is left is a big circle jerk echo chamber.

"You mean the basic technology all these Bitcoin clones are using? Absolutely.

This was a hard problem that I'm guessing no one figured out because until recently because the functions become more computationally intensive the more they're used and so any designer would limit the size of the hash to make it viable. But with too small a hash, too many hash collisions occur for the chain to be considered immutable. That's because a 1 bit change in an input would cause up to 4 bits to change in a 4 bit hash compared to 256 bits in a 256 bit hash. So with enough guesses you can find an input with an identical hash to another while having a small change in meaningful data. You may need to make a lot of changes to garbage like nonce.

that accepts bitcoins, would - and has - never ever let you wait for confirmations! As long as isn't a few thousands ‚Ç¨ or $, you - and the receiver - are totally fine with seeing the Transaction ""on the way"" (your Wallet/POS stating you're receiving a ""cash-like"" payment in the next couple of minutes) . That is good enough, for everyday payments.
If you sell a House or a Lambo, yes... have a seat with the buyer, invite the buyer for a cold one, make sure the transaction has at least 3-6 confirmations, enjoy that hour of conversation, do a test ride, show them the nice perks of their new house...
C'mon... i've paid with bitcoins at at least 50 locations all over Europe. NO ONE ever said ""oh err, please wait 10 minutes before you leave"", as the receiving Wallet shows in big bold green letters ""yeah, transaction on the way, you will receive the demanded 0,00xx btc"".",1524009104

A simple search will answer your question, and you won't even have to rely upon me.  Admittedly, this requires some technical proficiency.  You type your word in the search form, and hit return.  There's the form, right over here ----&gt; 

&gt; That's your opinion. I suspect it's a technically ignorant one. My opinion is that SegWit was an ingenious solution to the problem while remaining within the parameters of a soft fork.

Dash Core CEO Ryan Taylor [disagrees](https://youtu.be/4chQrvNF5lg?t=54m39s).  I guess he is technically ignorant, too?

&gt; If you understood anything, you'd realize that the Bitcoin Core developers aren't gatekeepers to the protocol. They only release software, it's up to the community to run it.

I understand quite well.  The Bitcoin Core devs introduced their ""soft fork"" to *prevent* a deliberate vote on their proposal.  They did so while they were simultaneously engaged in a censorship, propaganda, and sockpuppeting campaign.  Not shady at all. 

&gt; Lightning? Different developers, and it runs on top of Bitcoin, like Counterparty. It depends on Bitcoin, not replaces it.

"distrust of all institutions. Also because there is fraud in almost every element of our society today.

We live in a world of near total fraud, that's what drew me into cryptocurrency.

Almost every interaction we have in the real world AND non-crypto virtual world has some component of lies and deception. For example, when someone at a real world store asks you ""can I help you?"", they're usually not trying to help you. They're looking to see if you're up to something suspicious. They're also trained to say ""how are you?"", they don't actually care usually how you're doing, it's what they've been instructed to say. They're trying to not get fired, first and foremost.

Nothing is real anymore in our society, there is massive isolation and detachment, I saw it earlier at the gym today. People stare at their phones or are listening to music, ""plugged in"" like Mark Zuckerburg was in the 2010 movie ""The Social Network"".

In terms of fraud, those bankers that caused the 2008-early 2009 financial crisis were never punished. In fact, the banks are even bigger now and taking on even more risk via derivatives. We are all STILL nearly powerless against Goldman Sachs, Google, Facebook, and other massive monopolies. If those companies don't take our money, then our own government will with taxes. If taxes don't take it, then the high cost of living(particularly where I live in the USA) will.

The url from what I recall was a basic pornhub.com/crypto a pretty generic portal which seems to imply that in a month or two as the temporary exclusivity end Mindgeek will expand the accepted coins.

"**Too big to fail**

The ""too big to fail"" theory asserts that certain corporations, particularly financial institutions, are so large and so interconnected that their failure would be disastrous to the greater economic system, and that they therefore must be supported by government when they face potential failure. The colloquial term ""too big to fail"" was popularized by U.S. Congressman Stewart McKinney in a 1984 Congressional hearing, discussing the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's intervention with Continental Illinois. The term had previously been used occasionally in the press.

Proponents of this theory believe that some institutions are so important that they should become recipients of beneficial financial and economic policies from governments or central banks.

"**SPECIFIC TAX QUESTION**

I know crypto is taxed as a ""capital gains""

And capital gains are taxed based on how much you make and how long your held them.

ie... long term gain, making less than  37k$ a year  pays 0% in capital gains taxes.

My question, is this including the profit i make from capital gains that year?

**IE** I made 35k in income that year. And I made 10k in crypto, for a total income of 45k profit. Would i still pay 0% on that 10k?

OR...

would the first 2k be tax free and then the next 8k bumps me up to the next tax bracket(over 37k? ",1524006799

Non ERC-20 coins can be converted to ETH (while ERC-20 tokens cannot) which can later be withdrawn to the actual user wallet for a fee of 0.001 ETH (around 0.5$ at current price).

The race isn't so fast, you have a long time to act.

Proof of work at the heart of it (the immutable ledger of BTC). Game Theory on top.

"Guys, all jokes aside let's be sensible and analyze this. This actually makes a lot of sense why Pornhub would go through with something like this. Verge paid Pornhub with the crowdfund money for pornhub to open up this payment gateway. It's actually done through the third party website coinpayments, and integration is rather simple. It costs pornhub almost NOTHING and they get to pocket all the XVG that were used to buy the ""partnership"". It also gives them publicity and since there's already a negative connotation surrounding porn companies, more publicity whether good or bad is GOOD for the porn company. Lastly, by opening up crypto payment gateway, it's not like most people who own no crypto will go through the trouble to acquire Verge, it's mostly the verge holders and other crypto investors who may want to just purchase a little bit of Verge and get a membership without paying taxes on their gains. 

At the end of the day, Pornhub may very well know what a Shitcoin XVG is, but they don't care. They are about making money and honestly I don't see how they can lose in this scenario. The losers are the XVG holders who read more into this so-called ""partnership"" and held and maybe bought even more XVG. I can only see the coin declining gradually from now on especially with all the newfound scrutiny.

Invest safely and responsibly,
Cheers!",1524004104
"why are you bending your mind, downplaying this.

What would verge have to receive other than the right of it being exclusively used for it to become a partnership ?

Some free porn actresses, would that make a deal between a crypto and porn network a partnership ? Or maybe a couple years of free subscription for the devs ? Or maybe some actresses who are also really good coders who will code new verge wallets for free in their spare time ?

Don't you think usage is the main focus of a crypto currency when they enter into collaborations or partnerships or whatever you want to call it ? Especially in the adoption phase ?

Don't you think that is what all cryptos are currently after ? Deals that expand their actual usage ?

Didn't Verge just put a big step in that direction with an exclusive 'usage' deal ? 

Isn't that what you could deem a partnership ?

"@bitcoin twitter, the sub being named /btc, and owning the bitcoin.com domain aren't impersonating. Impersonating would be to convince people they're buying coins on the BTC chain when they are really buying coins on a different chain. You must understand, when we say ""Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin"", we aren't saying ""BCH tokens are literally BTC tokens"", we are saying the Bitcoin Cash chain is the Bitcoin idea. As for saying we have to make our own identity, no, we don't have to, we are attempting to preserve the identity that we held once upon a time. Read the very first section of the bitcoin whitepaper and you will see this Lightning Network is against the very initial idea. I've been part of Bitcoin for awhile and I want my bitcoin back, BCH is doing that. Blockstream came and took my coin, my idea, from me.
How is BTC more secure than BCH? BTC has RBF, meaning 0-conf is completely unsecure on BTC, whereas it has proven very secure on BCH.
And when you say you dislike the frontmen of BCH, are you referring to how Ver sold firecrackers in a place he should not have? Do you realize America has a massive prison problem where we throw people in jail for nearly no reason because of the prison industrial complex?
BCH isn't cheaper to use for any other reason other than fees are based on demand for hard drive space, not demand for block space like BTC.
BCH hasn't failed at all so far, I am completely amazed at the amount of merchants that have adopted the technology and the amount of commerce I have already done with the coin. I run a merchant website (crypto-armory.com) and most of my orders have been from BCH paying customers. Also, a lot of the crypto I have spent has been BCH.

I do worry about the technical problems they've had and agree that the whole 1-man-show setup has to change. Hopefully that is part of the partnership.

As weird as it sounds, people do still pay for porn. I don't. No one I know does (that I know of). Apparently PornHub had over a million sign ups for their premium site at launch and I assume they'll integrate something like micropayments into whatever amateur or cam sites they own. Also, from the little bit of research I did today, it sounds like it's more common to pay for porn in Asia. There was also a story about some UK legislation to cut off payment processors for porn sites, which crypto would circumvent. Maybe they're thinking of adding Verge in a way similar to STEEM, where you can vote/tip to raise visibility of a search term or actor/actress.

"&gt; No, you're missing the point. UTXO bloat is the issue, not the Blockchain.

Incorrect. Blockchain bloat is the problem because

&gt;No, you have to validate every Block. NOT every transaction!

... to validate a block you MUST validate every single transaction. Otherwise miners could put bogus txs in every block, and everyone else would just accept it. Not how it works.

&gt;This would be true, if you needed to download the whole chain.

You DO need to get the whole chain.

&gt;Though even now a miner can just ask for a copy of the UTXO set and recent blocks from anyone with a pruned node and run off of that with a custom implementation.

And here you slip on that giant banana peel... yes, that is something you can do, **IF YOU TRUST THE MINER**. That is, you are implicitly assuming a **TRUSTED** setup, giving up trustlessness, one of the key feature of Bitcoin. 

If that's the compromise you are willing to make, having to rely on trusted counterparties, then life is much easier, sure. But I'm not willing to do that.


&gt;2MB = ~105 GB per year of transactions per year.


Exactly.. and the current blockchain is ~150GB, so 100GB increases the blockchain by ~66%.

#Which outpaces tech improvements.


&gt;Because you're intellectually lazy.

You are missing the point, not putting in the effort to understand it, AND calling me intellecutally lazy. Then you do some calculations to prove your point. And yet, you are missing the point.


&amp;nbsp;

All the improvements you mention, (SSD cost, 5G, and more) is **ALREADY INCLUDED IN MY CLAIMS**. 

**Proof**: Moore's law gives you a calculation performance increase of ~60% per year. Nielsen's law gives you a broadband speed increase of ~50% per year. These two laws have stood the test of time, and I'm assuming that they are VALID. And, interestingly, there were *no significant deviations* from them, down OR up.

Hence, 5G and CPU speed + software optimization improvements **are already built in**. And no, categorically no, we will not assume faster improvements over these two laws.


So what now? Well, to your own calculation, with 2MB blocks the blockchain will increase **~66%** in the first year! 

66% &gt; 60% --&gt; Blockchain growth beats Moore law

66% &gt; 50% --&gt; Blockchain growth beats Nielsen's law.

**Conclusion**: Blockchain growth outpaces tech improvements.

"Both you and I have 5 bitcoin. 

You send me 1 Bitcoin so that you have 4 and I have 6.

You submit the old Channelstate so we both have 5, effectively stealing it back.

There is a 5 day lockout period before you can actually get the money back, and I can choose to sign the transaction and save some fees, or report it as fraud within that time.

I submit the penalty transaction, instantly getting all 10 BTC, leaving you with ZERO for trying to steal from me! I keep all of mine AND all of yours!


If you want to steal bitcoin, you must submit an old transaction and then hope that within 5 days, the other person doesn't come online at all. This means that you are not going to submit an old transaction unless you're 10,000% sure.


Maybe 1 in 1000 will succeed, but that means you lost 5BTC 1000 times to get 1BTC 1 time. It's called Game Theory.",1524002317

"I'm sure many people have already mentioned this, but this is due to recent announcement that MindGeek (aka. owner of PornHub) is integrating XVG into all of it's websites, starting with the major ones. The integration is already complete, and just goes to show that crypto really can be used as a currency. This level of exposure will be great for crypto. Although the publicity is almost laughable, it's still publicity for crypto. It's really fappening!",1524002091
"Just use whichever coin makes more sense to you. But if you ask me, this is how I see it:

Bitcoin is cash, meant to be used both as a store of value and for ""small casual transactions"", as Satoshi's \[whitepaper\]\([https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf](https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf)\) \(2008\) explains very clearly. BTC killed its use as cash on purpose \(which made us lose big merchants like Steam\), while BCH maintained it. So it doesn't matter how much market cap or hashing power BTC has. It's not Bitcoin, it's a new experiment, and it doesn't seem to work \(unreliable/slow transactions, random/expensive fees, etc\). BTC is 8 months old \(but its chain goes back to 2009 because they used a copy of the Bitcoin blockchain\). Bitcoin \(BCH\) is 9 years old. Through censorship and propaganda, Blockstream \(the private company funded by banks that controls Bitcoin Core and r\\\\Bitcoin\) managed to keep the BTC ticker. Brand and patents are important to them, because that's all they have, since their products don't work at all.",1524002050
"I'm kind of a newbie myself. My understanding, however, is that text, links, or extremely-compressed images can be inserted into the blockchain when it's being made. In this case, there were media reports last month that [illegal images of child abuse had been found in the BTC blockchain](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/20/child-abuse-imagery-bitcoin-blockchain-illegal-content), which could arguably make BTC illegal in some jurisdictions. Talk about poisoning the well...",1524002013
"The benefit of sending private messages from the same address is that the receiver of the messages can determine who the sender is from the transaction details that are already embedded in every bitcoin transaction. 

If you use xpub and send every private message from a new sending address, then you'd also have to embed your signature and public key in the content of the encrypted text. This would significantly increase the size of the encrypted message: it would add ~150 extra bytes. This, on top of the ~65 bytes of overhead already required for an ECIES message leaves practically no space for the message itself, with the 220 byte limit on OP_RETURN data.

It also wouldn't be much of a benefit privacy-wise, because all of the outgoing messages would still be linked unless the sender used a mixer between every outgoing message.

So, perhaps when the OP_RETURN data limit is increased even more, it will be possible to embed this extra data in order to achieve true unlinkability for the sender. In the meantime, I think re-using the same sending address is an OK trade-off to make to get true decentralized private messaging for the first time in history.",1524001882
It‚Äôs definitely not a scam but crypto buyers especially the Reddit ones seem to all be sheep. They don‚Äôt understand this is a good move. They just hate on XVG cause it‚Äôs not whatever their favorite coin is ,1524001857
"EOS is a great project in its own right, but I have a far larger holding in HPB, for some of the reasons below. 

HPB High level:

- They have an all star team. The CEO is Wang Xiao Ming who is worth checking out, he's well respected in China and has published several books on blockchain over the years. 
- R&amp;D team assembled from Huawei and Intel experts. 
- Backed by former OKEx and Huobi Executives. 
- NEO was an early stage angel investor. 
- Currently undergoing testing with the hope of achieving 1 million TPS using hardware acceleration. HUGE win if they achieve this net month. This is in comparison to EOS 100k TPS. 
- Collaboration with UnionPay Smart upcoming later this year, confirmed in updated Whitepaper. UnionPay are massive - think Visa and Mastercard combined. (Wang Xiao Ming worked for UnionPay and was part of the team that drove forward UnionPay Big Data)
- About 100 mil market cap currently, but relatively under the radar so far. If you're investing for the highest ROI, then you'd have a better chance of higher multiples of gains with this low market cap pick imo. 
- HPB have NOT focused on marketing yet, especially to the west. Getting in before they do will likely prove most beneficial. 
- High risk play, as ever with any crypto

Also, not a pro or a con, it is worth noting that HPB is Chinese and EOS American. 

Banyan Network will also be launching on the HPB Blockchain. 

If you're interested, I recommend having a look through the recently released updated Whitepaper, the Q&amp;A on the reddit, and then maybe join the Telegram group.",1524001839

The only reason you don't see the same posts today is because they are censored by a *minority* of individuals.

The majority of people that makeup the ""Bitcoin community"" don't have any particular opinion one way or another on the blocksize debate, and are basically just following the herd.

"Opponents to a block size argue that increasing the block size limit is unimaginative, offers only temporary relief, and damages decentralization by increasing costs of participation. Increasing the block size may set dangerous precedent for future increases. Additionally, introducing a social/technical process for a hard fork risks that very same process becoming a future attack vector within Bitcoin.
Small blockers argue that effort should instead be spent optimizing use of the block space we already have. They favor scaling solutions that push transactions off chain, and have no problem being patient while they are developed.
Small blockers believe Bitcoin‚Äôs main value proposition is its censorship-resistant nature and ability to minimize needed trust. They contend that these properties can only come from a Bitcoin that cannot be controlled. To evade control [read: attacks] from government regulators, mining cartels, and other adversaries, the system should strive to remain maximally decentralized, avoiding single points of failure or control.
In order to preserve decentralization, system requirements to participate should be kept low. To understand this, consider an extreme example: very big blocks (1GB+) would require data center level resources to validate the blockchain. This would preclude all but the wealthiest individuals from participating.
A low barrier to entry preserves the ability for individuals and small parties to participate fully in the network, without needing trusted third parties. Small blocks also increase network nimbleness by reducing the time it takes to bring new nodes online. This allows seamless network reconfigurations in the event of an attack.",1524001607

"Think about the precedent this sets.  Here's why this paid partnership is bad for crypto:

1. Alt already know the bullshit that is exchange listing fees.  These can range from $1,000 to several million.  Every merchant adoption is going to want their own payday now too.  This will be terrible for crypto adoption

2. If anyone does try to pay with the shitcoin that is verge, they have to deal with the exchanges to get bitcoin first, then they have to experience the shitty verge wallet.  This is a terrible first impression for crypto

3. Pornhub themselves will have a bad crypto experience when the verge dev accidentally forks his coin again or his shitty code gets attacked

2. It says shady-ass fundraising and announcement announcements are ok

3. It says you don't need good tech, competent development, actual privacy, or ethical marketing to succeed in crypto

I also just realized this isn't only Pornhub, it's with the parent company Mindgeek... they own a vast majority of the entire adult industry, be it production, distribution, or sites. Redtube, Brazzers, Reality Kings, etc. etc.

80-90% of people watch porn regularly... so if you can reach 100's of millions of people, possibly billions for under $3 million, I'd argue that's pretty reasonable. Others have spent a loooot more on incredibly worse marketing. Maybe Verge devs get their shit together, maybe this is a spectacular failure in a few years - or even months. But as of now, it definitely does a lot for the legitimization of crypto as a payment method.

If we do get truly decentralized exchanges, I believe you are correct that those would be difficult to fully tax. Though if they really wanted to, they could restrict access to the site within the US if it refused to pay taxes. Still, I'm not sure the government would need to even try as long as fiat currencies remain the standard, as you still have to convert back to purchase almost anything.

"I work for a E-Commerce company and part of my job is to find new payment methods and to manage the integration.

There is no payment processor or payment service that would require to pay something in order to offer their service. (Except you work in a high risk industry then they usually charge a few hundred extra)

They all make their money through fees. The fees might be higher or lower depending on how much money you route through their gateway.

Integration costs next to nothing. Only the manpower to implement the API in your system and to run the tests. With bitpay and Bitcoin it took only a few hours and most of it was for testing the service and ti understand how it works.

Whoever says they spend a shit ton of money for integration is either lying, dumb as fu*# or simply wants to sell something that no one wants.

Congrats to Verge. Collecting millions spend a little on ads and keep the rest for themselves while the kiddos celebrate for a payment integration. Looks like a crypto bubble if something simple like this causes trade volume and gains like the previous days.

Similar charts of UTXO counts and maybe even addresses based on a few metrics would be nice.

According to Bitinfocharts, almost 90% of the BTC supply is in addresses that have been ""dormant"" for over 5 years. I believe this means the addresses haven't made a sending transaction for 5 years. (Likely mostly cold wallets for exchanges and miners.)

Therefore, bitcoin had a perceived value far, far greater than it's monetary value (at that time) considering a) how difficult it was to obtain and b) how esoteric it's usage was.

"LN is awesome. But as a whole bunch of naive bitcoin owners discovered this month, the US tax system *hugely* disincentivizes us from using LN as described in the article. Every ""cup of coffee"" transaction we make over the LN is a distinct record of capital gains. It fragments our purchases of bitcoin into more and more lots that get too unwieldy to track manually. For LN to work we need software monitoring our transactions that can do all of that heavy lifting for us and knows the crypto tax law (which is itself nebulous) well enough to spit out something valid that can be imported into tax software. The closest analog in the pre-crypto world is the hundreds or thousands of transactions that day traders report at the end of the year. With something like TurboTax those records can be fetched right from the brokerage.

Until that exists the only way that I can sanely use crypto as money is to fill up a debit card once a month and report capital gains twelve times. In a sense I'm being my own LN that way, and for the foreseeable future that's way more sensible.

I hope that if we're making retail transactions with crypto with phones or cards or whatever, the same software that's doing that work will be doing the tax work concurrently. Because (barring major changes to the tax laws) just by using crypto we'll all take on the same sort of tax overhead that day traders do.",1523999096

"&gt; Help me out here....how do big blockers know that their network can handle more transactions? Is it simply because there are more transactions per block?

Yes. A 1 MB block can handle about 3,500 transactions. An 8 MB block can handle about 36,000 transactions. 

&gt; When the BCH vs BTC debate came about (I recently rewatched Roger Ver vs Blockstream guy - why I'm asking this question) it was said BTC has crippling fees, but wasn't their high fees due to high transaction volume?

High fees happen when the volume of transactions issued by users is greater than the volume of transactions confirmed by miners in blocks. When this happens, people start a bidding war in transaction fees in order to get their transactions into a block. The process of getting your transaction confirmed is an auction, where miners generally confirm the transactions with the highest fees first. It's like if you have 100 people who want to fly from Seattle to Portland every day. If you only have 50 seats on the plane, and if you auction off those seats, then people will start to offer ridiculous amounts of money for the trip. People who want to visit their mother will be outbid by people desperate to see their *dying* mother. However, as soon as there are more seats on the plane than there are passengers, the prices drop. Nobody wants to pay more than they have to, so if they know are guaranteed a spot on the plane regardless of their bid, they will bid $0.01.

&gt; Ver said BCH had lower fees, but surely they were just lower because they had low transaction volume; ie. less people used BCH so it had lower fees. 

This is almost correct. The full answer is that BCH fees are lower because transaction volume is less than transaction capacity.

&gt; If the same amount of BTC transactions were present on the BCH blockchain, how would the transaction fees differ?

BCH has 8x higher transaction capacity, so the fees on BCH will not start to rise until transaction volume on BCH is about 8x higher than BTC's transaction volume.

&gt; I would like to know, can 8mb block size handle the amount of transactions BTC was handling around December? 

Easily. December on BTC had about 1.4 MB worth of transaction volume being shoved into about 1.1 MB of space, causing about 25% of all transactions to either be priced out of the market or expired after they failed to confirm. This would only have used about 15% of BCH's capacity had it happened on BCH. After the May 15th hard fork, that number would be about 3%.

&gt;Has BCH been tested properly yet in terms of lots and lots of transactions?

Yes, there have been a few apparent spam attacks or stress tests on BCH. One such event resulted in block #[479469](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/block/479469), which cleared 37,814 transactions. Another event happened around [Jan 15th, 2018](https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/01/14/bitcoin-cash-network-shrugs-off-mempool-backlog-relative-ease/), in which someone issued enough spam to keep BCH blocks mostly full for about 2-3 days. However, this spammer could only afford to pay 1 satoshi per byte (about $0.005/tx), so it only increased the fees that real users had to pay to 2 satoshis per byte (about $0.01/tx).

&gt; Rewatching the debate just gave me the impression that Roger has the answers to everything, and it all comes down to 8mb block sizes (or higher). Can this approach work for scaling for mass adoption?

Yes. Current hardware and software can handle about [100 MB blocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJm2ep3X_M) on a mid-range desktop computer, which is enough for about 400 transactions per second. That's enough for 35 million people to use BCH once per day. Software advancements (like allowing the software to use multiple cores on the CPU) can increase that to about 1 GB blocks on a mid-range desktop computer, or about 350 million daily users. Hardware advancements (or using more advanced servers to run the network than a mid-range desktop) should be able to bring that number to the 10 GB range or greater, which will be enough for 1 billion users to use BCH several times a day. Getting to that level won't be easy, but it won't be hard either. It's just a lot of straightforward scalability engineering.",1523998955

"What I meant is that Satoshi could, had they intended for the 1 MB block size to expire, set a block height limit after which it would no longer be in place. They didn't. They suggested a way by which the community could raise the block size in the future. The community has chosen not to as of yet. I don't doubt that we will in the future, when there is an overwhelming amount of evidence that doing so is safe. If Bitcoin Cash were to actually process more transactions than Bitcoin while remaining decentralized, it would be *excellent* evidence for further raising the block size.",1523998911

"But it IS a partnership because crypto isn't static. 

If I give you a dollar, there's not much that dollar can do besides act as a transfer of value. If I give you a stake in a fluid currency, you have a vested interest in the development of that currency's features. Maybe you want to rip out Tor integration or add supernodes. Having a large influence on the currency's liquidity and mindshare means you can influence the development roadmap.

Conventional for traditional markets? Maybe not, but conventional routes are usually not feasible in new markets. So, you get these nonconventional strategies that are more prone to abuse, but can be used legitimately. There are partner websites, partner apps, partner banks, etc. Are those just marketing ploys? Maybe a better question would be, ""When is a partnership NOT a marketing ploy?"" You enter into the partnership for some advantage, which you want to convey to your shareholders/customer/supporters. Doesn't that require some form of communication or marketing?

Verge now has a new exit (and entry?) route, immediate and widespread adoption in a huge market, and a perception of legitimacy. In exchange, MindGeek gets an ideal coin for customers that want a discreet for of payment, a perception of progressive thinking, and (with rumors they were going to introduce their own coin) their 'porn coin' without investing in a team to develop a new coin.

will only be a world wide currency if... banks and grocery stores treat it like credit? no, that's not the only reason it would become way more valuable, there's a million things that could make that happen - there are things that haven't been invented yet that could make this happen. just like bitcoin wasn't possible until the internet, maybe bitcoin hitting a million won't be possible until something else is invented. so you can't say there's only one scenario in which this would happen.

"I'm sorry, but here's where I think you're now unwittingly unwilling to think through my responses.

&gt;It's completely different if you have to receive a HDD with data on it. There's PLENTY of room to attack the third party. PLENTY. Heck, you might as well rely on a third party to deliver a fully validate node! 

Try me. Suppose I asked you for an HDD with the blockchain on it. How would you attack, knowing that the first thing I'm going to do is check that the block header hash of the block [#518675](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/block/518675) that you sent me is 00000000000000000017a2de52189a1deb6c825f5f8c0a2c28b4dc0a168be301, as that is what network consensus demands? The amount of work you'd have to do to attack would be enormous, to find a full hash collision, not just difficulty-level validity.

&gt;I'll say it again, burying your head in the sand won't make the problem go away. And I showed you how this blockchain growth is REAL, not fictitious - Take 2MB blocks (effective size) and you're done, you're already outpacing tech. TODAY.

I disagree wholeheartedly. 2MB blocks is not even a terabyte a year. If you think that's onerous, your standard for decentralization is insanely stringent. Consumer-grade broadband of 100Mbit means you can download 300 GB in seven days. That's not unreasonable for a starting business, if that business happens to need an archive node for some bizarro reason. And a business like that would nearly certainly operate two such nodes, just for high availability.

&gt;And again this is just to keep up to speed with the network. What if you had to validate 10yrs of humongous blocks??? And how long does it take?
So get two EPYC processors. Or four. BCH's usage model is that there are small number of nodes, and a lot of SPV wallets that can probabilistically trust ten to twenty random nodes as a proxy for total network consensus.

&gt;You say there will be many across the globe? And you think governments would not unite to shut a handful of companies shipping Bitcoin blockchain HDDs across the world? Here today, gone tomorrow, at the stroke of a pen. Or a few strokes.

I think there'll be enough such businesses and that it'll be hard enough to prevent. Between checkpointing, Fedex, and archival magnetic tape over sneakernet, the ability to transmit blockchain data in bulk is already well established even in darknet type markets.

&gt;This is a good discussion, but I'm afraid you are not really solving any scaling. For one, as I mentioned many times, you are completely dodging the issue of blockchain growth, which would be faster than tech improves with stupid small 2MB blocks. You're advocating AWS for processing txs, and for some reason believe that's decentralized and robust enough that a concerted action of governments across the world would not shut down. And we have not even started to discuss block propagation and orphan rates which would come as a result of giant blocks. All of which dramatically reduces the network security.

I have not advocated for AWS for processing. Just data archival, if that. Small-business grade outfitting can already handle VISA-scale today; three or four rackmounts would handle global.

* Decentralised development (moreso than now)

"&gt;&gt; Well to be fair, Bitcoin was created out of thin air too

21 Million Bitcoin were created out of thin air ONCE. You have to have a currency exist to use it. There's nothing wrong with creating it once. Can't use it if it doesn't exist.

&gt;&gt; P2P loaning is a growing thing and bitcoin loans would probably use the same model

You're not getting my point. There is no way to just *poof* create bitcoin to lend out from central banks. While p2p lending or other central-based lending is a possibility, someone has to actually part with their bitcoin and take all of the risk. Lending would work differently as a result... very differently.

&gt;&gt; But you consider the current loaning model to be a detriment to society or the poor or whatever. 

Not necessarily. Like any system, it has its upside and its downside. I'm not fully convinced that the current system is that awful.

&gt;&gt; all I see is the movement of power from one set of people to others

The power to take advantage of recently created currency is an AWESOME power to have. Central banks have that power. Theoretically, bitcoin will make sure that nobody has this power. So it's not just movement of money from one group to another, it's destroying the ring of power. Every time money is created it's no different than taking money from everyone's bank account and giving it to those who have early access to this newly created money (banks and corporations). This makes money flow to those who already have money. This would also end.

&gt;&gt;  I‚Äôm not sure the regular person will benefit from crypto and decentralization...there will still be a group of people and businesses that can gain power/control in place of the banks and we can‚Äôt say for sure they will be better for society overall.

Sure, it's not an ""end all be all"" solution to society's ills. It does help in that it ensures that nobody can benefit from currency pulled out of thin air, which is always going to disproportionately be the ultra rich.

&gt;&gt; It‚Äôs always cool to fight the man though. But time has proven, there will always be the man.

It's a false dichotomy. Will the man's strength go from 100% to 66%? Will it go from 100% to 95%? It's not like the man is either there or not there. It's how much power ""the man"" has to maintain your analogy.",1523998235

You may have heard 90% or 95% of trades lose money (see Why trader Lose and Why the Market Requires It), or some other seemingly high statistic. From what I‚Äôve personally seen this is accurate. While I traded for a day trading firm, about 10 people came in ever couple months for trader training, or about 60 per year. For a five-year period that means about 300 people came to the trading firm and took (or at least started) the training program. Some traders I talked with think the actual number is higher; that is was closer to 400 people.

Only 14 (women and men, including myself) moved on to become regular traders, producing consistent profits for at least several years. That‚Äôs about a 3.5% to 4.5% success rate. Approximately another 10 made money, but not enough to keep them trading. If success is defined as just being negligibly profitable (for at least a couple months) the success rate is about 6% to 8%.

Scientist Discovered Why Most Traders Lose Money ‚Äì 24 Surprising Statistics

‚Äú95% of all traders fail‚Äù is the most commonly used trading related statistic around the internet. But no research paper exists that proves this number right. Research even suggests that the actual figure is much, much higher. In the following article we‚Äôll show you 24 very surprising statistics economic scientists discovered by analyzing actual broker data and the performance of traders. Some explain very well why most traders lose money.

1 - 80% of all day traders quit within the first two years.

2 - Among all day traders, nearly 40% day trade for only one month. Within three years, only 13% continue to day trade. After five years, only 7% remain.

3 - Traders sell winners at a 50% higher rate than losers. 60% of sales are winners, while 40% of sales are losers.

4 - The average individual investor under performs a market index by 1.5% per year. Active traders under perform by 6.5% annually.

5 - Day traders with strong past performance go on to earn strong returns in the future. Though only about 1% of all day traders are able to predictably profit net of fees.

6 - Traders with up to a 10 years negative track record continue to trade. This suggest that day traders even continue to trade when they receive a negative signal regarding their ability.

7 - Profitable day traders make up a small proportion of all traders ‚Äì 1.6% in the average year. However, these day traders are very active ‚Äì accounting for 12% of all day trading activity.

8 - Among all traders, profitable traders increase their trading more than unprofitable day traders.

6 - Traders with up to a 10 years negative track record continue to trade. This suggest that day traders even continue to trade when they receive a negative signal regarding their ability.

7 - Profitable day traders make up a small proportion of all traders ‚Äì 1.6% in the average year. However, these day traders are very active ‚Äì accounting for 12% of all day trading activity.

8 - Among all traders, profitable traders increase their trading more than unprofitable day traders.

"See, now there is at least a semi legitimate response...they took 'too long'.  I would argue that they didn't take ""4 years"", and in fact a good amount of the time they took wasn't time they took trying to figure out if this integer was going to crash bitcoin (they certainly didn't expect a small change by itself would have a huge impact), it was time they had to take defending their position and protecting from the BCH fork in general, and then time they took defending bitcoin from the riduculously developed segwit2x fork.

The 'anyone with a brain' comment is needlessly antagonistic, subjective and hugely inflated by the benefit of hindsight, and also objectively wrong to anyone who still considers the decentralizing aspect (regardless of Satoshi's blessing) to be an issue.  Not saying that they are right or wrong about the decentralizing aspect, but just because you feel it's not an issue is not a reason everyone has to lay down their swords and abide by your reasoning.  I've been wrong about a couple aspects of the decentralizing argument, so I'm not going to argue directly in that direction, but i'm definitely not on the 'blocksize increase at all costs' court either.

"&gt; enough of the networks hash power to at least have a chance at finding a block before the legitimate miners do.

Setting aside discussion of what breaking 0-conf would do if bitcoin relied on it for all day to day purchases, the double spend miner is not at a disadvantage here - he still gets to choose among all the other tx that the other miners can see, but he also has a couple extra tx that only he can see, and these double spend tx carry higher fee than the ""real"" tx. Isolated (disregarding impact on bitcoin prices), regardless of hashpower he only stands to gain.

Now, taking impact on price into account the miner has to consider two things: Will I break bitcoin doing this (-&gt; short the hell out of it) or will things go on as usual (-&gt; just mine double spends). Depending on hashpower one of these scenarios will happen.

Maybe it will be advantageous for the miner, or maybe not, its hard to tell exactly.

But thats actually not the real worry.  What should worry you is the actors who might not necessarily do this for economic gain. Relying on 0-conf turns the normal 51% attack into a much more surmountable problem, as you can end trust and usage of bitcoin by possessing a fraction of that hash rate.

When you're using your bitcoin you should resist re-using your addresses keys.  A seed is a key to many private keys.  This way you are free to store 12-24 words.  Use bitcoin properly where you're not re-using your addresses.  You can use electrum and sign your transactions offline with another computer using your master public key.    So either you print out and store 1000 private keys or 12-24 words.

Supposedly verge paid Pornhub millions for this ""partnership"", so it's more of a paid advertising.

Using verge to pay from Pornhub's premium service has no advantage to the consumer considering it's not even fully anonymous. They have to buy eth from coinbase, move it to an exchange to trade into verge, then send that to the website.

"Short answer: It depends on the exchange.

Longer answer: It takes a considerable amount of work for an exchange to make an airdropped / forked currency available to users, especially if they don't want to allow it as a trading pair (meaning people will *have* to be able to withdraw it directly, as opposed to trade it for BTC and withdraw BTC instead).

When you deposit money into an exchange, they generate a new public / private key pair that is unique to you, for each currency that they allow you to deposit. They keep an eye on your deposit address, and when you deposit something, they ""credit"" your trading account, and immediately move the money from the temporary wallet into either their hot wallet, or more likely, a cold storage wallet. The hot wallet / cold wallet will contain the sum of many people's deposits.

So when a new asset is created via a fork or airdrop, it is their hot &amp; cold wallet who are *actually* receiving the new coins. Most of the time, new tokens are irrelevant and become worthless rather quickly. In certain cases, like OMG, or BCH, people want their tokens to hold or sell in their personal wallet. Exchanges like GDAX will generally tell you to withdraw your money from the exchange into your personal wallet prior to the fork/airdrop.

Obviously though, many people do not withdraw. At this point, the exchange can do one of three things:

* Keep the money and spend it however it likes, as it is (probably) not obligated to give you the forked coins. In this case, as with normal fiat banks, your ""deposits"" are actually loans, an they're likely not ""legally"" obligated to return any forked coins.
* Implement the infrastructure necessary to allow for the trading of a new currency pair that allows people to trade it for a withdraw-able currency.
* Implement the infrastructure necessary to allow people to deposit and withdraw the currency directly.

Most of the time, they choose #1. This might not even be because they ""make money"" on it - rather because it is genuinely expensive and difficult to do #2 and #3, and there's no way to know for sure if a fork will be valuable ahead of time. They can always implement #2 or #3 retroactively (e.g. like GDAX did with BCH), but most forks end up worthless (like the other 10 million BTC forks).",1523995778

2. Why it took 75 mil XVG for Pornhub to start accepting XVG. What was that money used for? It probably only took a few hours for a worker to set up a wallet and interstate a XVG into the checkout process. They definitely didn‚Äôt need $3 mil for that. 

3. How this is ‚ÄúThe Biggest Partnership in all of crypto‚Äù and supposed to turn XVG into a ‚ÄúTop 3 Coin‚Äù. Steam used to accept Bitcoin and I believe Overstock still does.

You can't. But if you want to do the right thing you'll use DPL/IPA.

If CSW thinks he can survive the entire cryptospace turning on him, nChain and Bitcoin Cash in an all out thermonuclear patent war he's as delusional as he is stupid.

He's said he's going to extract out of anybody he doesn't like.

That's why you use  DPL/IPA.

[Here is the concept!](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8czboz/bitcoin_cash_pointofsale_concept_for_vending/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) Hopefully, if I have enough time, I can do a cleaner Photoshop version of this!

"Here's the text:

**Bitcoin Cash POS Vending Machine Concept**

The BCH POS concept is to be used mainly in vending machines. A company will send stickers with a receiving address, private key, and backup phrase.

The security glass prevents thieves from replacing the address by adding a small alarm if tampered with without the key.

Future plans include accompanying software that automatically updates the price (rounding to the nearest ten-thousandth) and can refund the sending amount if it's less than the price (minus transaction fees).

[Next to the Front design] NFC technology allows compatibility with BCH project *HandCash,* among other projects.

Inspiration:

I was largely inspired by the actual thing near vending machines, and how easy it is to function. I was thinking a lot about how it could work, and I believe the security glass with pre-given stickers would work best, as my main fear was worrying about people who'd put a sticker of their own address. In retrospect, the *Refresh* button would work better near the Price screen than implemented in the security glass (see *Initial Front* image, note the lack of *Refresh* button), but thankfully, this is a concept.

I probably would have never came up with the idea had it not been for the time I spend on /r/BTC. Thank you for taking the time to observe my concept!

"&gt; 1) Lightning network is not a sidechain.

It effectively is. If you want to call it a 2nd layer, fine. Hardly matters what it's called. Point is, it isn't necessary to move scaling off-chain.

&gt; 2) Nobody is forced to use Liquid, anybody can create a competitor, this is open development in action. 

Hardly matters since Blockstream has used its control of BTC development to force people onto 2nd layer solutions.

&gt; 3) You've twice linked to your only reference of the term unicorn, a tweet by a disgruntled investor trying to make a point. 

And? As I said, Blockstream is promising their investors massive financial returns. Where the fuck do you think that money is going to come from? 

&gt; 4) On chain scaling technically 'works', sure, I agree. However there are trade-offs to decentralisation. 

Not significant ones. If you have 1000 mining nodes and you make a change that brings that number down to 900, you've not materially hurt decentralization. Decentralization is not something where more by a few nodes is always so important that it overrides all other possible considerations, and the same with less by a few nodes.

Do you even know what decentralization means and why it's a good thing? The only thing you need decentralization for is to prevent the 51% attack. Any decentralization under that is desirable. 

&gt; The debate isn't if we increase the blocksize Bitcoin will stop functioning, its far more nuanced and subjective than that. 

Yes, it's far sillier than that, people acting as if decentralization was the ONLY FUCKING CONSIDERATION and ignoring everything else.

Nowadays selling the news lost its meaning because there is so much speculation, the price is already ¬´¬†priced in¬†¬ª meaning all the potential buyers are already buying at the higher price, and when they sell at the news release, then nothing but a huge drop happens.

"In the same way PGP is used to encrypt a secret message to a friend, you can do the same with a bitcoin public key. 

The wallet owner can then read your message by decrypting with their bitcoin private key.

A public address (what you send BCH to) is not sufficient for that, however. Instead you must have the wallet's public key, which can't be derived from the public address alone.

So if Memo were to publish the public key upon creating a wallet for a user, then your profile could feature a 'send private messages here' key.

With that, I could open Electron Cash, write a message to you, and send the encrypted message to you over any channel.

You could then open your Memo wallet in Electron Cash and decode the message.

Or this could all be done natively in Memo.

I agree with this. The discussion really doesn't need to go further. There is a need for a distributed social media platform, but it should be it's own thing.

I think memo is harmless in the short term, but long term (it should be in the planning stages now!) it should be migrated to be it's own platform.

Memo should be like it sounds, a memo like that of the memo line on a check. It could be pruned with the transaction itself if/when necessary.

I disagree with any platform that creates a transaction that is never intended to be spent, so as to be in the utxo set in perpetuity. Which i'm not even sure this does, TBH.

UTXO bloat should be fought hard against, but adding extra data to transactions is no problem, as it will just force a solution for the removal of spent transactions (as [described by Satoshi](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin/#selection-193.4-226.0)!) to be implemented sooner.",1523993194

"Some reasons why BTC might not get widespread adoption as a currency: The number of transactions per second is very limited (to 7 per second in the case of BTC). For comparison Visa can handle 56,000 tps.

It isn't a very good medium of exchange. Rising value encourages hoarding not spending - whereas inflation penalises hoarding of mainstream currencies. Say for the sake of argument that BTC has some kind of ""intrinsic"" value (the cost of mining it). If is circulating alongside fiat money, people are likely to spend the fiat money and hoard the BTC - see Gresham's law. 

You can't pay taxes with it. Governments, payment networks, PayPal etc could all arguably create more useful competing digital currencies. The blockchain technology is open source so anyone can get in on the act",1523992938
"&gt; What does it mean for something to be trustless?

You do not need to trust ANYONE in order to reach consensus. Yes, you need to download from ""outside parties"", but you are downloading from the network, from the collective of full nodes. That very collective of full nodes which determines consensus.

It's completely different if you have to receive a HDD with data on it. There's PLENTY of room to attack the third party. PLENTY.  Heck, you might as well rely on a third party to deliver a fully validate node! 

But the key point here is not so much receiving a fully synced up node, that's arguably a valid business model. It becomes a problem **if it's the only option**.

And even ""FedEx+HDD+fully synced node"" has a problem if the blockchain grows faster than tech improves. You are still refusing to acknowledge this simple fact. No one on Earth, nor AWS nor any other entity, can keep up. You are deflecting and diverting, trying to remove yourself from this simple fact... and I'm bringing you right back into a corner. If the blockchain grows faster than tech improves, there will be no ""FedEx+HDD"", because it simply won't be possible. Physically and technologically impossible. I'll say it again, burying your head in the sand won't make the problem go away. And I showed you how this blockchain growth is REAL, not fictitious - Take 2MB blocks (effective size) and you're done, you're already outpacing tech. TODAY.

&gt;Transaction validation speeds can already exceed 1000 tx/second on consumer hardware. Their estimate of VISA-level scale is 20 CPU cores. That is, one EPYC processor.


And again this is just to keep up to speed with the network. What if you had to validate 10yrs of humongous blocks??? And how long does it take?

&gt;We've already discussed how we can transmit large blocks in 1000x less space, we've discussed how to transfer terabytes and petabytes of data, we've discussed how to validate large transaction volumes.

Not really. You haven't really provided a solution to any of these issues, a real solution that prevents centralization from happening, and maintains the key properties of Bitcoin (decentralized, trustless, censorship resistant,...)  Just as an example, let's assume ""FedEx+HDD"" is a workable solution. How difficult do you think it is for a government to shut that down? You say there will be many across the globe? And you think governments would not unite to shut a handful of companies shipping Bitcoin blockchain HDDs across the world? Here today, gone tomorrow, at the stroke of a pen. Or a few strokes.


&amp;nbsp;

This is a good discussion, but I'm afraid you are not really solving any scaling. For one, as I mentioned many times, you are completely dodging the issue of blockchain growth, which **would be** faster than tech improves with stupid small 2MB blocks. You're advocating AWS for processing txs, and for some reason believe that's decentralized and robust enough that a concerted action of governments across the world would not shut down. And we have not even started to discuss block propagation and orphan rates which would come as a result of giant blocks. All of which dramatically reduces the network security.

And in a world where block space is cheap, like BCH advocates, here's a business that will drown your entire blockchain with bullshit junk unrelated to anything: ""*Say it with the blockchain.*"". Inscribe messages onto the blockchain. Target consumers? Artists, poets, writers... or more simply, teenagers in love. ""*Because your love is for ever, like the blockchain.*"" 

Charge $5 to leave an ""I LOVE YOU MARY!"" message on the blockchain. Do you think this could prove popular? If you're tempted to say no, Google for the ""bridge of love"" and let me know if you think the engineers who built the bridge thought it would have to sustain thousands of ""love padlocks"".

Reality is that if you make blockchain space cheap, people will abuse it and bloat your chain into oblivion. You have no idea how big those blocks will become, and how quickly. Never mind keeping up with technology. Ask the ETH guys what CryptoKitties did for them.",1523992930

This doesn't seem like it would be an issue anytime soon. All it takes is a look at the most recent blocks on the BTC chain to figure out that there really is no propagation delay, as claimed by Core:

From block 518,582 (ViaBTC) to the next (BTC.TOP) took a total of 13 seconds. This includes the block transfer, verification, and actually looking for (mining) the next block. Then the next block (BTC.com) took only 22 Seconds.

Later on we see block 518,597 (SlushPool) and 518,598 (AntPool) with 24  seconds between the two, these pools are on other sides of the globe!

Still later we see block 518,607 (BitFury) and 518,608 (BTC.com) have just 1 second between the two, despite being two completely separate pools.

The record is littered with these cases.

"&gt; The real problem is blockchain bloat, which makes it increasingly difficult for everyone to sync up a node from scratch. This includes miners.

I see you're still operating under the assumption that every miner needs to store every transaction since the genesis block.

This is a completely wrong assumption.

&gt;7.Reclaiming Disk Space

&gt;Once the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before it can be discarded to save disk space. To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash, transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [7][2][5], with only the root included in the block's hash. Old blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree. The interior hashes do not need to be stored.

&gt;A block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes. If we suppose blocks are generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year. With computer systems typically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of 1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in memory.

http://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin/#selection-193.4-226.0",1523991452
"&gt; Done.

Except you think you're smarter than you sadly are, because it's certainly far from being ""done"" whatsoever. 


Governments, specially our democratic ones, can't just ban Crypto just like that. For instance here in Germany are already laws in place that handle taxation on Crypto. 


If they ever felt like banning that, people would go out in the streets, because it's so big here. Also, on what basis do they forbid us from using this? That's democracy for you. People will not allow this bullshit to happen in the first place. Remember what happened in SK? People went to the streets on masse and immediately the hard bans were lifted and replaced with regulation instead. 




___ 


Not to mention, why ban it in the first place? You think Governments are that stupid and blind? 




There's going to be 2 types of Governments. 


1) Will ban Crypto and hunt people that use it. Here you will have great community for OTC trading, because it's peer to peer it will keep people in the ecosphere anyway. So they can make buying a stressful act, but that's about it. Eventually people develop better tech to circumvent the system better - ""done"". getit? 


2) Governments that embrace Crypto. Huge economic boost longterm, because all companies that emerge move to these places. 


Not only that, but people will be in your country and spend money there. Why is that? Because people that were actively driven off their own country, because they used Crypto to get rich, they will now move somewhere else with their money. To a place that welcomes innovation instead of trying to shut it down.

How do you propose to prevent someone inventing such a thing? 

Core has already failed, BCH forked, as a result, you will have the choice again should someone try to introduce proprietary IP into the protocol. 

&gt;&gt;The overt, covert narrative is projection. There is just the ASICboost IP. The one patent. Core define version of it to differentiate between who can and who do not have a right to use it in their software.

&gt;Do you have any idea how much harm patents did to 3D printing?

I've been using 3D printing since the first 3D printer, over 30 years ago I know.  I even launched a successful open source 3D printing project on Kickstarter.  I know how destructive patents are. I'm not defending patents. I've had an extensive discussion with CSW over the issue. IP is a fabricated construct that requires a centralized authority to enforce it. I hate patents, but I make a living out of them, CSW wants to use them to manipulate the stare, bitcoin is going to change the way IP is defined. 

&gt;What nChain/CSW is doing is they're essentially declaring patent war on every other cryptocurrency there is. 

MMMM. He's registering ideas so others can't register them and extract rent. (someone is going to do it you cant stop them) 

&gt;Do you want Twitter, Facebook, Google, Blockstream, Banks, Venture Capitalists, Ethereum, Ripple, EOS, Cardano, Stellar, IOTA, Neo, Monero, NEM, Dash, TRON, Tether, etc. wage a patent war against Bitcoin Cash and nChain?

Where is that coming from? There is nothing to fight if it is public knowledge use it, don't use proprietary IP. 

&gt;I don't want to see the entire cryptocurrency space be thrown back 20 years to zero while it morphs into a bombed out wasteland in the middle of a minefield. But that's exactly what's going to happen if you kick off a thermonuclear patent war.

I've have a good track record of predicting what going to happen you are full of FUD. You can't patent information in the public domain, Crypto is not going to wait 20 years for IP. there is no one to enforce IP laws in crypto, just a centralized authority.",1523991196

"You shouldn't trust Bitcoin as a monetary fund. You should trust it as a math problem with 100% security. 

In the event of a crash, the first thing that will happen is people will panic as they try to get as much PHYSICAL cash as possible. This will cause a run on banks, who just don't have enough cash on hand for that, so banks would close. ATM'S would be looted.

So, when that happens, people will rapidly sell all stocks, bonds, AND bitcoin. The value of Bitcoin will rapidly go from $8k down to $5. I know, everyone thinks it won't but I assure you, when people need cash, they get desperate as F to get it. During Hurricane Sandy, they had stores open with 'cash only', and that's what will happen again if the banks and markets collapse. So, if you think of Bitcoin only as an investment and not as actual currency, you will be fine. If you think of it as currency, you will run into a real problem when the market crashes and banks close. 

Typically, when that happens, and BTC crashes along with it, very wealthy people bail out the US Government and banks. They basically loan out their cash to float everything until it can sort out the crash. While this is happening, they also buy the BTC for pennies on the dollar, which essentially means that the top 1% own even more while everyone else scrambles to get their hands on printed paper money.

The videos on YouTube are laughable, as everyone says 'but Bitcoin will survive all of that and be a global currency'. This is only going to happen if two things occur: 1) Grocery stores AND banks allow the taking of bitcoin like a credit card purchase.

"&gt; Again, this is a trusted setup - You are giving up trustlessness. Sure, if you are happy to give that up, many of the current problems disappear in an instant. But then you are giving away one of the key properties of Bitcoin.

What does it mean for something to be trustless? That's a real question. Is it the property that you choose who to trust? Or is it the property that you can verify what was transmitted to you? Or is it that you can always rebuild from scratch?

From your response, you're leaning towards the third definition. In that case, a from-scratch blockchain rebuild ultimately relies on you downloading from outside parties, so your setup is still subject to trust. Trust in a network of independent nodes, but trust nonetheless. You can always validate that it is indeed trustworthy by means of validating block headers, checking difficulty, and cross-comparing with the ""current state of the network,"" by some definition. (I will hand-wave your assumption that the network itself is trustworthy, because, again, your resync'ing your copy of the blockchain from the network presumes that you trust the network.) But Fedex+Hard Drives gives you the ability to solve the second, because with ""a blockchain"" shipped to you, you can recalculate from the genesis block provided to you, all the way to its termination, and then validate ""with the network"" that the provider's claim of the last block header is indeed the network's consensus. If you're looking for the first property, you can choose any such provider of blockchain shipment service.

[Transaction validation speeds can already exceed 1000 tx/second on consumer hardware.](https://scalingbitcoin.org/stanford2017/Day1/Stanford_2017.pptx.pdf) Their estimate of VISA-level scale is 20 CPU cores. That is, one [EPYC processor](https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819113471).

&gt; or something? This is no way to address a problem, that's hand waving.

I'm not even **pretending** to claim that what I said was the be-all, end-all solution. But for the purpose of restarting and rebuilding a node, consensus checkpoints are a pretty obvious first step. DHT magnet links for UTXO snapshots, embedded within the blockchain itself, can provide a secondary torrent-like archival layer - one that can be independently verified - while getting up to speed fast.

&gt; To answer your question... that time is measured in years, not decades. Most definitely years. The genie is out of the bottle... it's just a matter of time before everyone jumps in. By the looks of it, Tim Draper might actually be right on his 5yr prediction.

We've already discussed how we can transmit large blocks in 1000x less space, we've discussed how to transfer terabytes and petabytes of data, we've discussed how to validate large transaction volumes.

If something is bound to happen eventually it makes little sense to bury your head in the sand.

We can only play the hand we are dealt.

If a couple of million kids using bitcoin can collapse the financial system then why would you want humanity to continue using such a fragile system. There is a far greater chance that extreme money printing experiments around the world cause major problems.

Finance broadly defined should not be a function of dictate. It should be a competative open market where humanity as a whole gets to choose whats right for them. If todays existing financial system cant handle competition then it is not beneficial in the least to humanity.

No one is forcing anyone else to use bitcoin. It is opt-in by design. If the current financial system benefits humanity then there is nothing to worry about.",1523988874

Usd gain from crypto to crypto trades is pretty pointless. Tracking every trade in usd value you can end up paying several times the value you ended up with in taxes. Atleast if you're trying to gain more bitcoin for example. If your goal is more bitcoin you can sell at a loss in usd and buy back at a higher price than you sold at and still end up with more bitcoin. The only thing that is important to the irs is how much you gained in the end. Maybe keep track of your total gains per week. If you start with 1000 one week and trade up to 1100 the next and by the end of the month you have 1400 keep track thay you profited 400 that month. But if you track usd value for those trades it could end up showing that you earned 2000 profit. ,1523988034

"Ok, well we‚Äôre not going to get anywhere on the ‚ÄòI‚Äôm a better programmer then you‚Äô side of things, mainly because I wouldn‚Äôt argue that I‚Äôm a particularly good one, but things like ‚Äòpretty obvious‚Äô and ‚Äòalready worked it out‚Äô are total cop outs when addressing the idea of unintended consequences.  Aside from potential technical concerns, which you are stating Satoshi already ‚Äòdecided wasn‚Äôt an issue‚Äô (and I state isn‚Äôt enough to completely hand wave past), they had legitimate concerns outside of blocksize, one of which was already threatening the decentralization side of things, and they believe, honestly or dishonestly, validly or invalidly, that blocksize is another risk to decentralization.  Now maybe you believed the transaction limit was enough of an existential risk to take Satoshi‚Äôs assurance that blocksize posed no other technical issues, that the decentralization risk is bogus or worth the sacrifice, and that other issues could wait, but the fact is that this group of developers didn‚Äôt agree.  Whether they, or someone on their behalf, engaged in FUD/bullying/censorship/what have you aside, they didn‚Äôt agree and they didn‚Äôt take FUD from the other side as something that forced them to compromise.  Basically, both sides felt strongly enough that neither side backed down, and that‚Äôs fine...consensus is one of the things Satoshi realized needed to be designed into the process, and it was invoked and will supposedly continue to balance out this arguement and maybe many others after it.

As far as me ‚Äònot getting anything done‚Äô as a programmer, maybe you could be introduced to the concept of risk vs reward.  If I‚Äôm writing an app or a database call system, errors happen, hopefully most are caught in testing, but if the code is simple enough, things that aren‚Äôt caught until production are either reasonably quick to solve, or require a rollback (of which we maybe have complete control and users are just advised of it, not voting on it). In situations like this, I would of course increase the block size, it has immediate, necessary benefits, it‚Äôs been vetted by some pretty smart people, no expected downsides because I control future increases and I know or dictate the users bandwidth and storage, if I want to roll back I do so immediately, etc.

If I‚Äôm working on software for the space shuttle, the block size would be increased in some insanely controlled environment, tested to the extreme limits of what me and some way smarter people can conceive, a redundant system without the change is probably sitting somewhere else on board, there are a dozen rollback scenarios created and fully tested, and it probably still isn‚Äôt approved for the next few dozen launches.  And this is still where we have complete control over every piece of equipment, and managed in a hyper centralized command structure.

Now, even with the crazily distributed structure of bitcoin, where a ‚Äòrollback‚Äô could conceivably be hundreds of times more controversial than a change (mostly because lots of people might literally be banking on feature X and don‚Äôt want to lose money just because feature Y broke), you seem to be comfortable playing it as though you were me in the first example.  It‚Äôs fine if you‚Äôre comfortable with that, less understandable when you are basing your opinion on hindsight and a rollout that you felt went ok, but if you‚Äôre going to argue against people who maybe feel like bitcoin leans more towards NASA level scrutiny than Android app level scrutiny, you‚Äôre going to come across as not very reliable or are simply biased.

&gt; Today, New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman launched the Virtual Markets Integrity Initiative, a fact-finding inquiry into the policies and practices of platforms used by consumers to trade virtual or &amp;quot;Crypto&amp;quot; currencies like bitcoin and ether.

&gt; As part of a broader effort to protect cryptocurrency investors and consumers, the Attorney General&amp;#039;s office sent letters to thirteen major virtual currency trading platforms requesting key information on their operations, internal controls, and safeguards to protect customer assets.

&gt; &amp;quot;With cryptocurrency on the rise, consumers in New York and across the country have a right to transparency and accountability when they invest their money.

That's it. Not ""lol gainz"" or even the valuation of it. Don't care much.

It is also quite trivial to convert fiat into bitcoin. ",1523987282
"Fiat is backed by nothing. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called ‚Äúfiat‚Äù.

You say crypto is not backed up by anything yet you are contradicting yourself by saying ‚Äúwasting Terra-watt hours of power for nothing‚Äù. 

It‚Äôs backed by physical computers, lots of them, all around the world, processing the blockchain, getting paid a reward (cryptocurrency) for using computing power to secure a blockchain involves actual electricity and money (that of which you believe is backed by ‚Äúphysical assets‚Äù when it‚Äôs literally backed by nothing).

A blockchain once it gets live out in public, no single entity, government, company, insitution can claim ownership or control it, not even those who created it, and it would be impossible to cheat or modify transactions. Therefore the code that involves transactions thus the number of coins to be circulated cannot be tampered once a blockchain goes live unless you make a fork that creates an entirely new coin or make network improvements, but you will not be able to alter the transaction records itself. So you can‚Äôt even call this a pyramid since no single entity is even controlling it. All it is just you have a record (blockchain) which is being processed by millions of computers around the world, and it processes transactions, and each transaction has to be confirmed and agree with all the copies of the same blockchain all over the world. Those who gets to confirm (or mine) the transaction will get a reward, increasing the circulating supply, thus increasing demand, thus increasing the coin‚Äôs value because of its usage, which is how literally everything gets its value. That‚Äôs it.

Value is purely subjective, there is nothing intrinsic about it. We put value on things arbitrarily.

Do you think the universe itself would look at my pair of shoes and say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs $100‚Äù? No, we say that. 

Computer code, electricity, money, gold, silver, cigarettes, basketballs, ethernet cables, pretty much everything are all made up of the same thing, the only difference is the configuration to make them exist and the demand which determines value that everyone in the world in an equilibrium of opinions, decided what things should be worth. Standardization from arbitration.

This is where crypto gets its value, is that it‚Äôs actually more useful than fiat.

Because of it‚Äôs decentralized nature, you can be your own bank. Banks are completely useless at this point to be a store of wealth when crypto exists like DAI. People don‚Äôt realize this yet and you obviously haven‚Äôt realized this yet. But I have and it will be a matter of time before people realize banks are now pointless to exist. As long as you are the only one who knows your private keys or wallet seed, literally no one is storing your money but you alone. Since there is no single point of failure, since nobody can own the blockchain, even if the creators of a coin died, along with their website, operations and everything. Even if all of the first servers who mined the blockchain gets destroyed, the blockchain will still operate. And blockchain is virtually impossible to hack. You try to change at least one single character in one transaction, even in one server, if it doesn‚Äôt agree with all the copy of the other servers all around the world, it won‚Äôt get through. And all of these servers or miners don‚Äôt even have to know each other. It‚Äôs completely backed the people themselves but in a completely trustless way. That‚Äôs why crypto‚Äôs are more secure than banks, no matter how you look at it. In fact, the more hackers trying to hack the blockchain, the more secure it becomes as more are altering transactions, the more the blockchain will disagree.

It can also be used as a mode of payment or to transfer money without the need for a bank or transfer sevices.

It can be used as a liquidity tool for bank transfers.

It can be used for trustless elections (block explorer is public and blockchain code is open source).

Considering that you are not allowed to change the code regarding the transactions and circulating supply, and the more transactions that is being processed in the blockchain whether it‚Äôs from trading or mining, the higher mining difficulty becomes, which in turn would force miners to increase their fees. The more coins are being mined means more coins are being distributed in circulation, the higher that coin‚Äôs value becomes. This is simple supply and demand. There is no pyramiding going on here. Please do your research first before making it obvious that you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. ‚ÄúThose who got in first‚Äù argument doesn‚Äôt work here. You are forgetting this is a market. It has cycles. And the crypto market isn‚Äôt even in mass adoption yet.

Although I would agree with you on one thing. Mining needs to die.
A more efficient way is staking. Securing the network by just owning some coins which consumes significantly less power is more economical and more efficient. And this is probably where crypto is headed.

The idea isn't to keep Bitcoin Cash's fees at 1 satoshi/byte. It's to keep fees as low as realistically possible. There is a lot of good development happening right now to make that possible (network protocol optimizations, higher caps, etc).

In the end, normal people (including both individuals and businesses) don't care how many satoshis/byte they're paying to get their transaction onto the blockchain. They care about how much it costs in their local currency.

It's the reason why many services that use BCH pay transaction fees on behalf of their users, whereas this has become extremely rare on the BTC chain.",1523987033

&gt; We fulfilled all our promises from our white-paper, no delays, no adjustments, no excuses

&gt; We obviously collect most of our trading commissions in BNB and most of our other revenue are also only payable in BNB. We could sell them as we collect them, then do ""one-big-buy-wall"" on the market, or we could keep them do one big sell order and then buy it back with one big buy order. Or we could just keep all the BNBs we collect, do one withdraw to a wallet and burn it there. We could do any combination of the above.

&gt; The important thing is, the team portion has never moved. They still sits on the contract creators address. That's our reserve. We did not burn that. The BNB we burned are additional BNB we earned/bought/sold and then bought or however you like to call it. It's pretty simple.

&gt; Regarding the transaction history, we simply process this withdraw from a different cold wallet as the number is rather large. It's a wallet we don't use that often.

&gt; As most of our revenue is in BNB, when we have to spend fiat money, to buy some take outs for example, we could sell BTC or ETH we raised during our ICO, or BNB to BTC to fiat, or BNB to fiat directly on the OTC market, or any combination of the above. We don't disclose this part. It's our private affairs.

"&gt;I would like to know, can 8mb block size handle the amount of transactions BTC was handling around December?

Yes... bigger blocks allow for more txs/s. This is a fact.

&gt;Are lower BCH fees just a consequence of their blockchain being less popular?

Absolutely. 100%. Undeniably. Or more precisely, low fees are  a consequence of blocks not being full. The exact same thing was happening in Bitcoin a few years ago.

There's another, more subtle, reason - The price of the two coins. Very simply, both coins measure txs fees in terms of ""sat/b"". Example - A standard txs is 226b, so if you set a fee of 10sat/b, you'll pay 2260sat for the txs. Now, the price ratio is ~10 in favour of Bitcoin. This means that **everything else being equal**, a Bitcoin txs will cost you 10x as much as a BCH tx when expressed in USD! The flip side of this is that if BCH was 10x as expensive, then the reverse would be true.

If you check this website, https://fork.lol/, you can see that when expressed in sat/b, BCH fees are only half of what Bitcoin fees are.

&gt;Has BCH been tested properly yet in terms of lots and lots of transactions?

No. At least not in the real world, BCH has never had to cope with sustained high traffic. Since inception, BCH has averaged ~100 txs/block, which is a lot less than Bitcoin.

&gt;Rewatching the debate just gave me the impression that Roger has the answers to everything, and it all comes down to 8mb block sizes (or higher).

Of course, that is what his goal is... to convince people that all you need are larger blocks. And he's a very charming guy, it's not difficult to believe it if you listen to him.  Unfortunately the rabbit hole is a lot deeper. And Samson Mow is a tech guy... not really skilled at debating.

&gt; Can this approach work for scaling for mass adoption?

No. This is why small blockers insist on small blocks. Well, it doesn't work if you value decentralization and trustlessness. I've written about this extensively on this sub, you can read the most recent conversation  at https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8cmwo7/debating_or_talking_technical_stuff_with_somebody/dxiae1w/?context=10000

"I'm not saying ""they sold because they were trolls"". I'm saying they were normal users, but uninformed enough to get tricked by Blockstream into selling BCH as soon as it was possible for them. Then they became trolls to protect their worldview. They wrongly believe \(sunken cost fallacy\) they can't afford to realize BCH is the real Bitcoin and they have been fooled. They believe they are making objective/informed arguments \(eg: Bitcoin can't scale, coffees can't be in the blockchain\), when in reality they are too emotionally invested in the decision they made. They could fix their mistake, but they won't because they rather double down and troll BCH to hinder its progress and make sure their decision was right. They made the wrong choice and they want to make it right by force, instead of doing the logical thing: accept they have made a mistake and fix it.",1523986320
"I'd be more focused on the incentive to reinvent the porn industry than the shilling of XVG.

The fact that they are taking a step with the crypto disruption means that people will definitely invent and push new business models.",1523986315
"That‚Äôs what I thought before I understood the technology.  Governments can‚Äôt stop it, only delay it.  A country that bans it does so at their own detriment, while the countries that do not ban will be enriched. 

Look at the NY state bitlicense to see this happening in a microcosm. NY is the financial capital of the world in the legacy financial system, but after the bitlicense was enacted they saw a steady outflow of crypto-related business. Those businesses and their wealth (and tax revenues) still exist, but now they do business in a more friendly regulatory environment outside of NY.  NY state loses, while some other state (or country) benefits from their loss.  It‚Äôs a game theory problem, and since a decentralized network can never be censored out of existence, no reasonable government is going to enrich others at their own expense.

You should check out /r/buttcoin. I think it‚Äôs much more on your wavelength.",1523986308

"The network effect of Bitcoin is huge, which gives a big advantage over alt coins.  I haven't looked at those you presented.  They have not been tested at Bitcoin scale.  They might be great, and might have dominated if they came first.  But they didn't and now are mostly lost in a sea of alt coins.

For me, I don't want to mess with dozens of coin types.  So each time Bitcoin gets more useful, pulling in new ideas that solve problems, I am happy.  Happier than when I see a new coin invented, even if that new coin solves all the same problems. ",1523986270
"As I mentioned below, though, cryptocurrency has higher aspirations than just being an innovative ""tech."" The government was never going to step in and regulate the development of film, VHS, or DVDs--there was no real risk of a ""DVD ban."" However, because crypto wants to be a medium of exchange or a store of value, there will naturally be more governmental attention. And if its widely perceived as a porn token/drug token/etc., regulators are going to be much more willing to ignore its merits and crack down.

",1523986261
"Bitcoin is accepted thousands of places in the world and they've never paid a single satoshi for adoption. Same goes for several in the top 10. Verge even made holders pay for their 'adoption', I seriously don't get how people can defend that.",1523986223

It's a good sign that ICON and other currencies are being listed on bithumb and other Korean exchanges.  It seems that Korea and exchanges have sorted out alot of their regulatory issues.  They are the first to do so out of the major crypto markets.,1523986133
"I'm personally not so worried about that; broad acceptance of film, VHS, and the internet were all driven by initial adoption by pornography. As much as folks here are aware of the many use cases of crypto, most folks aren't, Contrary to your assertion, open public acceptance/support isn't the biggest determiner of adoption -- actual use is (which is why, in the past, porn has sometimes driven technological development).",1523986101

"Disagree. 

It makes zero sense to pay for porn with cryptocurrency right now, because it's just so difficult for the average joe to buy it and store it in the first instance.

You have to get FIAT onto an exchange to start with - and right now, to do that, you have to prove your identity - just like opening a bank account.
You then have to buy a partner cryptocurrency, like ETH or BTC.
You then have to use that to buy XVG, a coin which fluctuates in price.
So you have to navigate this difficult to learn interface and place a buy order.

Now you have to setup a wallet - download software, create and sync a wallet and enter the confusing world of long digit private and public keys, secure storage etc.

Finally, you get to make a deposit on pornhub via I guess your pornhub account.

What a total nightmare. ",1523986058

It multiplies current scale by an order of magnitude. And more second and third and fourth layer solutions will be built upon the rock solid stable fundemental foundation base layer protocol that bitcoin has built.

"Thank you so very much for contributing your lifelong experience in academia to the study and publishing of this topic, something we have long needed. I wanted to ask you to opinionate on some of the following. You said..

&gt;An identifying property of these assets is that contributors to the network quality (miners) are compensated in new units of the same token that are enjoyed by consumers of network applications.
&gt;As a result, network quality and the DNA price are jointly determined.

&gt;Furthermore, if consumers expect a higher (lower) network size in the future, the market clearing price increases (decreases) today. This implies that changes in expectations about network size will translate into changes in equilibrium price. 

I wanted to understand this better, and wondered if you accounted for variables like miner *untrustworthiness*, something we have experienced greatly in the last few years in our economy? We have seen an monopolization upon ASIC fabrication (bitmain, estimated 3-4 billion in revenue) that has lead to anti-competitive effects such as hostile patents (asicboost) which increase centralization through  ""cheating"" the proof of work, increasing hashrate marketshare, while at the same time reducing the usefulness of the network by mining empty blocks.

If the network size grows, but grows in a way that increases detrimental behaviour (selfish mining, asicboost), does this not reduce trust, and therefore price?

You have directly tied the value of censorship resistance into the value, and the above actions demonstrate attacks upon these properties. How much ""weight"" did you give to consideration of the balance between network size and the quality of miners?

How does the transactional fees of the Bitcoin network effect price? Did you examine the equilibrium between miner subsidy vs transaction fees, and how those fees impact usage of BTC as a medium of exchange, and how this property relates to the overall value of Bitcoin?

I apologise if this was covered in the paper, I have read the summary but not yet dug deep into the full paper. I suspect most of us here are laymen and won't be able to digest the full academia so your AMA is extremely valuable to us!!!

"&gt; He sold it at its peak and cashed out,

I don't know how people can repeat this untrue statement over and over and over again. He sold at 3 difference prices. Do some research before spreading lies.  
  
&gt; To publiclly sell all of his stock and exit the market sorta send a signal to everyone else, sorta like if Bill Gates or Elon Musk sold all their stock  
  
Not even close to being a good comparison. CEOs/Board Members of major companies hold a large portion of the company's stock. It's common. For crypto, we DON'T want single individuals holding a large portion of the currency because it would become CENTRALIZED. The purpose of crypto is to be DECENTRALIZED. Charlie held too much power with the stack he had. He is also a very public figure in the crytpo community who always speaks his mind via Twitter. He would not be able to Tweet whatever he wanted to if he still held a large stack of LTC. Why? Because he would be called out for being a market manipulator.  One tweet could send LTC's price to the earth's core or to the moon. Is that something cyrpto wants? For one person to hold that much power over one coin? Think about it man.",1523985804

Probably because Verge in the cryptoworld is seen as mostly a scamcoin. There have been a lot of red flags in the past year.  Just 2 weeks ago there was a 51% attack and the whole way this partnership was setup is just weird to me.

"Yes, can't scale. As I mentioned in another post, so many clinging to this delusional fantasy of how Bitcoin and its new and improved ""Lightning Network"" it is going to solve the scaling and exploding transaction costs. The truth is that there is a huge misunderstanding that unlimited scaling (via the new Lightning Network) will solve all Bitcoin's problems. Because every open/close of an LN channel means an expansion in transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, causing the bottleneck shifts from a limit on the transactions that can be processed on-chain to a bottleneck on how many payment channels can be opened or closed at any given time. It's important to remember that Lightning doesn't allow instant settlement of funds. That means that you can't spend lightning funds until the lightning channel has been closed and the final state transmitted to the blockchain. Effectively what lightning does is allow a massive increase in the capacity for changing ownership of BTC but the BTC doesn't ""move"" until the channel closes. This means that if more than 7 channels want to close per second you will once again get lag.",1523985564

"Counter to... Yeah you get the point

1) true and I hope it drives adoption. We badly need it.
2) we (crypto) need more than millennial money to achieve the heights we're aiming for, and that includes the more conservative crowd. Not that verge aims for that demographic, tho. Far more aimed at millennials. And to that PornHub is a step in the right direction.",1523985482

Your point could justify Roger's commitment to promoting Bitcoin, I don't think so. 

The reason there was a split is a result of ignorant investors who refused to upgrade and remove the 1MB limit. 

The reason the BCH price is low is that these investors **know** you won't ever need to remove the 1MB limit. They sold their free insurance policy.

"So I‚Äôm with you on the fact that every little nerve in my body just screams stay away when it comes to verge. I would never touch it but that‚Äôs just my personal investing preference. It might not currently have the fundamentals to justify its valuation or hype but you have to give it to Verge and their marketing for being able to build such a strong cult like following. This is how many things that have no apparent value can start to develop value. And it would be foolish for us to not recognize that. 
But as far as the usage of the term ‚Äúpartnership‚Äù that‚Äôs actually how many partnerships in industry work. 
Like I work for a tech consulting firm and we have partnerships with IBM, SAP, Oracle, AWS, etc. all the big tech companies. But the partnerships are structured in such a way where it has to be beneficial to both sides. So like they are usually set up where either we have to bring in x dollars of quarterly revenue for them OR pay a lump sum of money to keep the partnership status. We get access to their marketing channels and also support services and training while we bring them value either in terms of revenue or direct payment. So yes this is still a partnership. Eth and BTC just have enough natural payment volume I‚Äôm assuming that they generate enough revenues for them to maintain those currency gateways. But perhaps verge doesn‚Äôt yet do that and they had to pay a certain fixed fee upfront to qualify. 
But it isn‚Äôt really a validation by mindgeek that verge is strong enough on its own. It‚Äôs just that mindgeek gets a fixed cash flow income from adding verge to its accepted payment options, while it wouldn‚Äôt cost that much to add the option. So they make a massive guaranteed profit from doing so both parties win.

"Let's just say, for argument's sake, that today (US Tax season ends) really does mark the start of the next bull run, and tomorrow BTC begins to soar.  Here are the things I am curious about...

1. Will BTC pass and stabilize above 11.7k?  We bounced off of this number the last two times we hit it.

2. If we do pass it, will BTC continue on to a new ATH?  It does seem likely that a new ATH is possible this year.  The question is, will it be mid summer, or will we crash again, and not see the next ATH until near the end of the year?  

3.  In the past, when BTC went on a big run, alts got crushed.  There was a point when BTC was near 19k in Dec that alts dropped down to probably 10% of their current BTC values.  Talking about 12/6-12/15 date range.  However, it seems the market is more evenly spread out these days.  The more promising alt coins having taken a larger share of the market.  Does that mean less of an impact when BTC rises?  

4.  Finally, as in Dec / Jan, when BTC does top out, will the money then bleed back into the alt market, and send them to a new ATH?    

Basically, I am trying to decide if it is safer to sell all my alts now, hold BTC until it tops out, and then buy back into the alts when it looks like they hit bottom.  

However, if the general consensus is that alts probably won't take as much of a beating again, I will probably just hold them during the BTC run.

These questions are pretty basic, and I am sure most of you share the same concerns.  I have my opinions on what will happen, but I am more curious what you all think.

"There are also 1000 that ICOs and just tanked and never recovered.

Honestly, ICOs are such a lottery, I just don't bother.

For every Antshares or WANchain, there's a million pieces of junk, which look promising then just take money and die.

With SO many good buys out there still, like Neo, OMG, VEN, ICX, WAN (still amazing buy), why bother with ICOs. All those could still 100x, and are far more likely to do it than some random upstart.

Also think about it this way... if you are an expert in crypto related technology, programming, etc.. aren't you already in and part of a team/project? 

How ""good"" are the new teams of people? If someone is an expert in this field, they are already in the field. Sure there's maybe the odd person who is a programming genius and just now coming over to blockchain related projects, but for the mostpart, most of the people who have been here for 2-10 years already, those are the experts. Why would you want to back some random new team instead of the real experts who are currently driving projects.

For example, OMG was working on Plasma for 2 years before they even ICO'd. They are likely going to release mainnet in the next few months. The hype hasn't started for that yet. They are going to release Plasma shortly after. The hype for that hasn't started yet.

Those two things are MASSIVE, and will explode OMG and ETH.

There's so much good quality investments like those, that why bother risking money on ICOs that are 99% likely to evaporate?",1523984591

Then with stealth addressing got introduced that solves the optional ADDITIONAL privacy through hiding the addresses, and ringCT is being worked on as well

"I doubt sincerely they can track all crypto transactions even with software designed to do so, just think about the scale of the task.

Most tax authorities have trouble collecting normal tax from individuals that are self employed and get paid in cash on occasions.
That is why governments would rather have everyone working for companies so that the tax is deducted at source and easier to claim.

"Personally I don't care where other people stand on the issue. That being said, when you acknowledge what's known to be the false and incorrect name for a currency then your company loses credibility.

"&gt; An important initial step will be to reach a consensus within the global regulatory community on the role crypto-assets should play. Because crypto-assets know no boundaries, international cooperation will be essential.‚Äù

The reason some crypto-currencies have as much value as they do is that the IMF and central banks and basically helpless to control their monetary policy.

Once crypto currencies start draining serious liquidity from the major central banks / fiat currencies, they will lose the ability to set monetary policy for fiat currencies as well.

Any attempt to print money on their part will cause the price of their fiat to plunge far enough to not cause any net increase in total liquidity (and probably then some), at which point there is no point.

So in the end, it will be bitcoin deciding what role the central banks and the IMF play and not the reverse.",1523982734
"Having multiple nodes doesn't matter if there's no currency. If there's no btc on each side of the channel, the probability of finding a successful route decreases. 

I don't think LN is a solution. Bitcoin worked just fine with micro transactions years ago.

"You can't deny the fact that they crowdfunded millions just to pay PH to become a partner. It wasn't a deal made based on the practical merits of Verge.

"All good. I'm kind of new to Reddit and knew one of you would attack my post. Not mad at you at all. I can assure you one thing though...

I'm not a bagholder. I just spent last week with not only the CEO of Kik, but around 20 members of the Kin team in NYC. Kin is far from a money grab. It's being built correctly, with a focus on reaching the average consumer who has yet to be exposed to Crypto. It probably rubs most of the traditional Crypto crowd the wrong way with it's high total supply and lack of big exchanges (for now.) Both of those are with a purpose though.

Your Blockchain comment is short-sighted. It's not that Kin can't choose a Blockchain, it's that they've been stress testing a Blockchain capable of consumer grade applications. The 15M MAU transacting Kin within Kik alone would crash Ethereum. That's not to mention the other users across partner apps. Kin will be the most used Crypto by the end of the year by a wide margin.

"When you don't batch, almost every transaction creates two outputs, one for the payment one for change. Space is wasted for the additional output and for the signature to spend it in a subsequent transaction.

When you batch, each transaction creates many outputs, at most one of which is change. So asymptotically batching halves the number of outputs created for a given load.

Batching can also reduce outputs by combining multiple withdraws into one. E.g. Alice withdraws 1 BTC to her wallet then 5 minutes later withdraws 2 BTC more. If the batch hadn't issued yet this just gets converted into a single 3 BTC output.

Lightning is on main net and Eclair is on the google play store so forget about counting transactions anyway.",1523982257

Namecoin came out in April 2011 and the idea came from discussions with Satoshi and was codenamed bitDNS. They decided it'd be better to use a separate blockchain instead of Bitcoin. Still an interesting usecase, but just resulted in a bunch of squatters trying to buy names in hope their value would increase.

Litecoin came out Oct 2011 and the only reason it took off was because it was claimed to be GPU resistant and Charlie's marketing as Silver to Bitcoin gold (He admits this in multiple interviews). But we've all learned ASIC resistance is not real unless you continually change the cryptography. 

There were plenty of other premined scam altcoins between Namecoin and Litecoin, ixcoin comes to mind. ",1523982147

"TBH a lot of the criticism was right. People in that subreddit were honestly talking about paypal, ebay, and even bigger things. This is nowhere near at all what that would meant, and it was really dumb to guess those.

People say SCAM for those but I don't think most people really think they're a scam per say, more so just a shitcoin artificially pumped. XRP gets hate, but at least they honestly do have a ton of huge things going on. It has been hyped as a big thing since it was made, it just gets flack because the coin itself isn't used in a lot of the cases, and the centralization aspect.

The industry makes a lot of money, and a very small small percentage is from people paying, and a much smaller percentage of those people would ever chose to buy crypto, trade for xvg, then pay with it. 

Granted I will give them that it's a good case of adoption moving forward. You obviously won't start out with a ton of people using it even it it was bitcoin. 

It also doesn't really take away the fact that they essentially bought the partnership, they havn't really addressed that nothing is really keeping your transaction that private or untraceable. Which is why you would think this would have been  a good match.

I still think that marketing aside, looking at what other privacy coins have to offer, the value market cap of verge is ridiculously high. It's all about who gets their name out there first though I suppose. ",1523982055
"""After an initial flurry of interest among merchants in accepting bitcoin in their retail or online stores, interest has largely died down as increasing bitcoin transaction fees and volatile price movements made it less attractive as a means of exchange""

Quite literally the first paragraph. I must indeed be retarded.

And the second paragraph being even more true and to the point:

""That doesn't mean that there are no outlets to spend your bitcoin, however, far from it. It's just that bitcoin volumes at these outlets has generally not met expectations, and by the time you read this, some may have discontinued that option."" Yep.

"It is painful how obvious this is... Please be more subtle and people might listen to you more.

These kinds of low effort posts are usually made by discord shills who accept small amounts of crypto for payments per comment. All that matters is that they make a post with positive words, they screenshot the proof and post it to discord to get their commission.

"The environmental disaster narrative isn't substantiated by facts. I agree that energy consumption should switch to 100% renewables, and because renewables are the lowest cost alternative, Bitcoin is actually subsidising investments to generate renewable energy. Energy crisis and monetary system solutions - 2 birds with 1 stone.

Andreas Antonopolous was featured on a CaSE podcast](http://www.case-podcast.org/16-bitcoin). At around -00:15:00, he provides a great response about energy consumption in Bitcoin.

Summarized:

-**Energy is being wasted**

Clearly, Bitcoin is useful to some people. Judgements about whether or not something is wasted is best left to those using it. We don't end up with a good society if we start deciding for other people what is useful and what is not. 

To people who value censorship-resistance, neutrality, global access, completely decentralised system of currency with no geopolitical attachments, Bitcoin is a very useful application. Some would argue it is the most useful application in the 21^st century.

You can't do the security of Bitcoin without the investment in energy. To those who say you can, they are saying that you can get something of value out of nothing. There's a reason why the security of reason costs that much in terms of energy; if you do it for less, it's less secure. If it's less secure, you won't have a valuable network.

The energy in Bitcoin is not wasted - it's *used* to make the network secure without central authority. No one has demonstrated at scale an alternative.

-**What about Proof of Stake?**

There is a lot of complexity in using an intrinsic currency as stake for the security of the same currency. The game theory gets very complicated. Proof of Work is straightforward: you spend resources on energy in order to secure the virtual asset. If you decide to fuck it up, not only do you lose the value of the virtual asset, but you also spent money on energy that you are not going to get back. This creates a level of grounding. 

This is the primary basis on which Bitcoin achieves immutability; the idea that it is as computationally expensive to re-write the ledger for 3 days as the amount of energy you spent to write the ledger the first time for 3 days. It is one of the security guarantees that Bitcoin has - in order to re-write the ledger, you have to expend the energy again, but you receive the reward once. This makes it very very expensive to re-write even small stretches of the ledger. We do not know of a better basis for immutability that doesn't use energy, and I would challenge anyone who claims that there is.

-**The Nirvana fallacy - comparing Bitcoin to something perfect**

If this world produced all energy from renewable resources, and all energy is used for useful things, then perhaps we may look at Bitcoin and ask whether or not the value of Bitcoin is commensurate to the energy we are using. None of the journalists did even a cursory examination of what energy is being used for today. 

Let me give you just 3 examples: Bitcoin's energy use is *one hundreth* of the energy used in mining gold. Gold is integral to the monetary system that Bitcoin is directly trying to replace. There are also environmental costs of mining gold - from sulphuric acid leeching into rivers, denuding hills, destroying mountains, etc. A tiny fraction is being used for industrial use, the vast majority of gold is being held as store of value.

Let's take a look at things like Christmas lights. The entire electricity use of Bitcoin in a year pales in comparison to the 1 week of electricity being used to power Christmas lights in the US alone. There are additional effects such as light pollution, and the majority does not come from renewable resources. You can argue about the pointlessness of such tradition.

More practically, every charging device with a step-down converter sits plugged in and coverts electricity to heat. The estimated power this consumes is *2 orders of magnitudes* greater than what Bitcoin consumes. This is a worldwide phenomenon which is an enormous drain of energy. Cherry on top: the world's largest polluters and energy spenders are military; the main purpose they serve is to kill people.

We haven't even discussed the amount of energy required to support the existing banking system.

-**Journalistic dishonesty and sensationalism**

Spare me the righteous indignation of the environmental impact and waste of energy of cryptocurrencies - it is unscientific and completely hypocritical. All of the journalistic analysis goes like this: if it takes X kilowatts to conduct 1 transaction, and we took it to world scale, how much energy would that cost? They disregard that the energy used is completely unrelated to the # of transactions. The equivalent flawed thinking would be, ""if this pregnant lady's belly is THIS large at 3 months, then in 5 years, it will be as big as this entire room."" That is the exact scientific value of extrapolating something on a variable that is not dependent.

-**How are you sure of your numbers?**

We can estimate the lower bound of energy consumption, and say that it is unlikely that the real number is twice as much as the lower bound. The energy requirement to do a hash is a fundamental thermodynamic law. You're flipping bits, and they take a certain amount of energy to flip. You know the computational energy efficiency of 16nm ASIC-based chips. If you assume the network operates on this (which is incorrect, but again, lower bound estimate), and we know exactly how many hashes/sec are being calculated, because that's recorded on the blockchain, then we can calculate exactly how many joules of energy it takes. If you assume 50% of miners have 1 generation of miners behind (unlikely, because miners require optimisation), then it is at most 1.5x the lower bound of energy consumption.

It is easy to estimate the amount of energy being used in Bitcoin, which makes it an easy target. When you use your VISA card, you do not see the 600,000 employees who commute to work using gasoline-burning cars, the 26-story buildings which are lit 24 hours a day, data centers which are doing fraud prevention and analytics, as well as selling data to intelligence agencies and advertisers. All of this costs a lot of money and energy, and arguably just as ""wasteful,"" but it's a hidden cost.

Firstly, every transaction on Memo is a paying transaction, this means it won't be like Twitter or Email where people just tweet anyhow because it's free.

For most of us, this means we won't be posting like how we do on social media because you can't delete what you posted.

In the end, I think the worry is unnecessary because what's the worst that could happen? Slightly higher fees than the current 1 cent because if you have to pay more to post something, less people will post it.

"I'm gonna try to talk objectivity about the ""Massive partnership"" with XVG and Pornhub. Firstly, getting crypto integrated with the porn industry is pretty big, porn is the driver in almost all technologies. I'm happy for the XVG bag holders for not getting scammed and actually getting a decent announcement, I wouldn't call it the biggest ever, but its a good one. 

My issue and concern with the whole thing is the claim that it is a ""Partnership"". Companies do not pay millions of dollars to partner, to me this an agreement. Pornhub had agreed to integrate Verge on there networks for a fee (which was paid for by the verge holders through donations).

To me, Pornhub has no incentive to integrate XVG outside of the fact they got paid millions of dollars to do so. If Pornhub wanted cryptocurrency integration, wouldn't they integrate a coin that has a greater ROI such as BTC or ETH? It doesn't make sense to only integrate XVG, the ROI for the them wouldn't be high enough, but since they got paid for the Agreement, they don't really care.

So to me, this is more of a High budget marketing campaign then a partnership.

how about you read an actual real economics book? a book that would be used in colleges for example. You just complain about a system that you don't understand and instead referring to pseudo science like Austrian economics

I don't use Twitter, I have no knowledge of what that hashtag was used for before this conversation. Let me tell you, saying #metoo doesn't mean what twitter says it means.

Read Roger's post, it's okay I'll wait, done? Great. Let's go through it together, so we are both on the same page as to what the words ""me too"" mean.

"**Bullish Outlook at the moment**
https://www.coindesk.com/8500-bitcoin-eyes-gains-with-key-support-at-7900/

**Bitcoin remains in a bullish territory for now and is looking at further gains, though a pullback is possible if support at $7,900 is breached, according to technical studies.

The cryptocurrency's first attempt to scale the long-term descending trendline (drawn from the Dec. 17 high and Jan. 6 high) failed on Monday and prices fell below $8,000 as expected at 12:00 UTC.

It's worth noting that the Bollinger bands (seen on the chart below) show the volatility dropped after BTC dipped below the psychological mark, likely signaling indecision among the bears. As a result, it is not surprising the dip below $8,000 was short-lived.

As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $8,145 on Bitfinex, largely unchanged on a 24-hour basis, but could soon report further gains as the hourly Bollinger bands indicate scope for a retest of $8,400-$8,500.**

"This is the statement on the youtube video by PornHub:

""That‚Äôs because, as of today, Pornhub will start accepting Verge Currency, the most secure and anonymous cryptocurrency on the market.""

I feel like it is our duty as responsible crypto enthusiasts to explain to the PornHub team that they have literally partnered up with the laughing stock of crypto technology. 

1. Verge is not a true privacy coin. TOR native integration does not equal true privacy. This is an important note, since there are real privacy coins out there like Monero who do offer true anonymity. 

2. Verge developer(s?) are laughably inept and bad at coding. There is nothing original about this Doge Coin fork. Their ""privacy"" is obtained through using TOR (which is not their tech). Even their much advertised RingCT solution is a rip off of Monero's Ring Signature technology and is yet to be created or implemented.  I mean sunerock forked his own coin by accident for god's sake - that's how bad this team is. 

3. The coin experienced a MASSIVE hack which was continuously suppressed, downplayed and ignored by the verge ""team"". Bans, deletions of posts, counter-attacks by the team. This whole story was quickly swept under the rug and the way Verge handled it is akin to Trump crying ""fake news"" loudly and then diverting attention away. 

All in all - I am happy that crypto as a whole is getting this kind of exposure. I am however very worried about it being done with such bad examples of crypto technology, when there are true and revolutionary technologies out there on the brink of changing our world. 

So finally I ask, who can we contact at PH or MindGeek in order to let them know what they are getting themselves into? I am honestly pretty disappointed that such a big company would partner with Verge without doing their due diligence in assessing the overall product. ",1523978296

Now replace each FooCoin with a different crypto - BCH, NANO, XLM, DASH, etc. Hopefully you can see my point.

"Congrats for not diving down my points but just breaking it down to being a libertardian and who's the bigger, more important country?

Yes, I'm an developer and drink crypto-koolaid for breakfest and can see all the technical and economical advancements (and issues) it brings.

You should really learn to differentiate (like for example the value it brings from the current market situation, the bad from the good and so on).

And I guess you missed Coinbase, GDAX, Gemini and all those FIAT Payment Apps / Gateways in development just for the US alone ... Just because you can't use CC anymore doesn't make them less easy. I can understand them from blocking CC purchases due to the chargeback fraud involved. You can't buy stock with CC eitiher.

Aside from that many cryptocurrencies are more like securities anyway - and right now they have no legal liabilities, that has to change to hinder / stop fraud like Bitconnect popping up. So yes it's actually in one way a good thing (even if it's bad in another way).

No system is ever perfect, everything comes with trade-offs, and everything takes time to build and refine. The way you argue sounds more like the typical expectation of ""buy and forget - automatical win because you deserve it"". That can't work (forever).",1523977532

PornHub has become very successful over the past years, why? Anyone want to take guess? 

BECAUSE IT'S FREE

So..... We add a crpyto to simultaneously pay &amp; remain anonymous.  So, let's take a look at our demographic!!!

We have married men who don't want their spouse knowing they pay for live cam models to jack-off. I can see pornhub taking verge for memberships as well which only helps the married man that doesn't want his wife to know he likes his porn membership. But, I truly don't see who else would use this method IF THEY EVEN PAY AT ALL. 

Again, PornHub has become successful because of their free model. SO when you add payments into the mix, and payments in the form of crypto, you are opening a very very small window. Yes it's great a company as big as pornhub has accepted crpyto, I love this. I also love the concept of porn and anonymity hand in hand.

"Dear Verge Familiy,

After our succesfull crowdfund we have been waiting for this moment, and it's finally time to announce who we have partnered with.
We have been able to partner up with MindGeek! This will greatly benefit our community but also crypto as a whole.

MindGeek (formerly Manwin) is a privately held company headquartered in Luxembourg operating from Canada which focuses primarily on Internet pornography. It has its headquarters in Luxembourg City, with main offices in Montreal and additional ones in Hamburg, London, Los Angeles, Houston, Miami, , and Nicosia.
MindGeek owns and operates many popular pornographic websites, including video sharing services Pornhub, RedTube, and YouPorn, as well as adult film production companies Brazzers, Digitalplayground, Men.com, Reality Kings, and Sean Cody, among others.",1523975949
"It's not decentralized as it's hard to do the fiat side in a decentralized way. It's the same model as LBC with escrow and arbitration, but supporting more Cryptos.

Yes BCH / VEF is directly supported. Also 200 other altcoins are indirectly supported (using BCH, LTC or BTC) as escrow. It's also possible to go fiat to fiat e.g. VEF to USD, or VEF to XAU (gold). Almost any trade pair is possible.",1523975947
"If you believe a ""partnership"" includes paying millions of dollars for your ""partner"" to advertise your ""partnership"" you're naive. That's called paying for advertising. And yeah, that can cost a shit ton of money. So you have to ask yourself who is full of shit. It's either not a partnership and the community was lied to or a shit deal.

I don't know about Western Union, but crypto is 100% digital. Accepting a crypto payment would be as easy as setting up paypal or stripe through your website. This doesn't cost much at all.",1523975917
I was expecting a shittier partner. It's not that bad actually. But there's no exclusivity here. Pornhub accepts BTC as well and probably more in the future.,1523975913
"The recent events including such statements should really make users and businesses reconsider the safety of hardware wallets. The known vulnerabilities/risks of hardware wallets are:

- frequent need for firmware updates including critical ones
- a need to have seed words handy in case firmware update requires it
- a bug in RNG(s) could cause predictability for some private keys
- not able to control privacy/which coins to spend (sometimes you can do it via third party app though)
- not being able to mix coins = everyone knows your balances
- not being able to store privacy coins = everyone knows your balances
- a rogue/angry employee (see Shapeshift hack) could push a rogue firmware update 
- a bug in firmware could expose private keys or cause loss of funds
- wallet software has very narrow set of features (Trezor doesn't even support ETH directly at all; If you use Ledger for smart contracts, you can't see what you're signing)

In order to mitigate those risks compromises must be made, but for some use cases it might be worth considering:

- generating a bunch of (encrypted?) paper wallets (hundreds if needed)
- using a dice to generate seed
- using a dedicated offline computer 
- using a dedicated online computer with just OS and trusted wallet software (i.e. for mixing coins, ZEC/monero wallets, transacting with paper wallets and exchanges...)
- never keep large crypto amounts online (either on your PC or on exchanges)
- using a dedicated mobile phone for crypto transactions/payments
- using multisig

If you have other suggestions for security practices or SW/HW to recommend, please comment.

But that means that when people need their money to sit for a while (because they have no current need of it), they either have to put it at risk (as you say) or lose a little at a time.

We NEED a place where people can park their money without it losing value and without having to take on risk.  Right now there aren't a lot of options for that.

"The problem with that approach is that bitcoin, like gold, is lousy as a fiat currency because it's inherently deflationary. That is, there's a strong incentive to hold it and wait for it to appreciate in value, rather than to spend it. That kind of thinking gets encouraged by the stories about the guy who spent [10,000 BTC for two pizzas](http://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-pizza-10000-100-million-2017-11) in 2010, when he could have had $100,000m in fiat if he'd waited. No one wants to be that guy. 

As a result, economies based on inherently deflationary currencies tend to have depressed growth compared to economies that use inflationary currencies, like most modern fiat currencies. If you know that the dollars in your mattress are going to be worth less in a year than they are today, then you have an incentive to either spend them to meet your needs or to invest them in order to receive a profit. The fact that bitcoin (and virtually all other cryptocurrencies) lack those incentives will hamper their ability to replace fiat.

The money porn makes comes from primarily ad revenue with movies/camsites etc also. Pornhub premium  makes Pornhub some money that's obvious (couldn't find a number on the amount of subscribers with a quick search, not sure if the info is even public).

Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly  
Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc  
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc

You can find a list of all the wallets, exchanges and blockexplorer that have already adopted native SegWit addresses [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32_adoption). The more companies that implement SegWit the more scalable bitcoin will become. Lower fees on the bitcoin network will also help make it more accessible to the greater public.

"&gt;Are you concerned with validation time, or with transfer? 

Both, actually. Moore's law gives you ~60% increase in performance per year, and that is **inclusive** of software improvements because the quaint ""doubling of transistors"" has come to a stop already. (Note: I am assuming Moore's law for valid, though it is not clear if it still holds.) If the blockchain grows more than 60% per year, your full validation will take longer and longer.

Nielsen's law of bandwitdh gives you a ~50% improvement per year. If the blockchain grows at more than 50% per year, it will take you longer and longer to download.

&gt;Because transfer, to me, is not that hard to solve with Fedex and a pile of hard drives. Copying intra-network and at device level is fast. A Samsung 960 NVME drive, today, reads at 3.2GB/s, and that's consumer grade. You could build a business on shipping hard drives of the blockchain to anybody that cared.

Again, this is a trusted setup - You are giving up trustlessness. Sure, if you are happy to give that up, many of the current problems disappear in an instant. But then you are giving away one of the key properties of Bitcoin. I'm not willing to give that up, we'd be back to central banking in a heartbeat.

&gt;And because the recipient would have the entire blockchain, from genesis, they can also fully compute-validate and network-validate on block headers.

Again, Moore's law comment from above... you are NOT escaping the limits of technology improvements. For the sake of avoiding any doubts...

#If the blockchain grows faster than tech improves, you have a problem.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Block and UTXO archives, hosted, but verifiable through an SPV-like mechanism, gets you the rest of the way. You want to make it costly to fake? Archive the UTXO set, find a magic nonce to meet some difficulty requirement on hashing that entire set, and embed both hash and nonce into a block header, **or something**

**or something**? This is no way to address a problem, that's hand waving. 

*To solve all global warming issues, just collect all the CO emitted by every source of pollution, or something.*

If you have a specific, real proposal on how to fully validate the blockchain by not starting from the genesis block, by all means put it forward for review. Trust me you WILL be hailed as a blockchain hero, even if you don't want it. Just keep in mind it has to be fully trustless, not relying on this or that node/party telling you all is good.


&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Will there be a time when these are real problems for which these outlined solutions won't be enough? Yes. Is that time measured in years, or decades?

And this is one more blunder that is very common, the idea that all this big volume of data will only happen in decades. That's not how adoption works. if you ask Tim Draper, in 5yrs everyone will be laughing at you if you DON'T use cryptos. You may say who cares about Tim Draper, and I kind of agree with the sentiment, but it does contain some real world truth. That is, at first you're an idiot if you DO use Bitcoin, but then a time comes when you're an idiot if you DON'T use it. And nobody wants to be an idiot... hence everyone rushes for the door at the same time. Look up the ""adoption s-curve"". When you reach the inflection point, it ramps up bloody fast. MUCH faster than ""parabolic"".

You may say this is all theoretical and how it doesn't apply and so on. But we've observed real life examples of this late last year, in crypto at that! How? FOMO and users rushing to get registered with exchanges so they could get in the game. The exchanges were NOT prepared for real scale, and **virtually every exchange had to shut down new user registrations** to cope with the demand. THAT is what I'm talking about - All of a sudden, everyone wants in.

To answer your question... that time is measured in years, not decades. Most definitely years. The genie is out of the bottle... it's just a matter of time before everyone jumps in. By the looks of it, Tim Draper might actually be right on his 5yr prediction.

False. Witness data is moved to the end of the transaction, and the witness merkle root is on the coinbase scriptSig. There is no ""offchain"" data.

Exchanges and other blockchain businesses will always run a node and can't be cheated, further preventing any fraud from perpetuating. As it stands, Lightning is but a dream that currently depends on broadcasting every transaction to every node on the network. And when fees reach beyond $20 and delays reach many days and weeks like in December you should have seen that the full block policy is not sustainable either.

Yes, you're right. Which is why, in reality, I wouldn't sell on a flash crash, I would sell before. Because the market indicators are almost always there. Sure, you win some, you lose some. That's the way it goes. That is however, not an indication of how your overall portfolio is thriving. 

Look, I get your point, and for most people, ""hodling"" is probably the smart move. 
My point was however, that there is an alternative, that if you're good at it, can net you a far superior amount of cash in the long run as well as short term. 
Also, someone who's trading with $500 doesn't need to mitigate losses. Someone who's trading with $500,000 do. Or worse, $50-500million. 
You don't need to bank 500% on a portfolio like that. You want an increase of 0.2 - 1% daily. If you're good, and the market is ripe, you can always net a higher percentage, but in a bear market, 1% per day, is more than enough.

Any government actually attempting to base their economy on it would need to use different tools in their macro-economic policy to stimulate purchasing.

Your problem is most likely with the source of your deposits. You need to do your best to trace every deposit back to a recognised source. If you can't or are unwilling, your money is gone.

I suspect HitBTC are being forced to go through this process. Ultimately, no exchange will be able to accept 'Black' coins. I suspect we will see it this year.

Now if they actually sat and thought about it, surely constant daily/weekly use of the device to help transfer some HODLings to/from their device to a cellphone would result in more wear and tear of the device, more devices lost etc... thus more devices ordered?

If Lightning Network ever wins the Nobel Prize for the coders by fixing the routing problem, becomes a lot more securer and somehow used by billions of people it is actually bad for Slush as people will be risking all their funds online in hot wallets to try and make a few satoshis from channel funds.

"Most wallets will use your computer and a pseudo random number generator to come up with your seed.  You'll want to back that seed up.  It's a list of 12 or 24 words that follows the BIP39 standard.  

You could use a set of fair dice to generate your key or add entropy to your key.  

So long as you have those 12-24 words you'll be able to use a tool like [this](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/) to recover your private keys.  

So then it's a matter of using a computer that never touches the internet or a hardware wallet (the same concept).  To keep your keys safe. 

You can also consider something like cryptosteel to store your seed in a fire resistant matter. 

Personally I treat my phone like it's my wallet in my pocket.  Never anymore than a couple hundred dollars on there.

Then you can use a hardware wallet for coins you're going to hodl for mid-term.

Then you can do straight cold storage where your key is generated offline with added entropy etc.  Then you back up the see in cryptosteel maybe encrypt it and put it on a few USB keys (encrypted of course) and distribute them across the world.

"First of all I hold verge. 

I've been following verge for roughly a year now and I still don't get how it manages to pull this off. Back then it was just your regular shitcoin with (semi) active development and a cool faucet. Not much has changed since then (except the faucet is pretty much dead) and for verge to be taken serious it still needs a lot of development and work. 

But for some reason it still appreciated like crazy... 

Not sure what to think of the upcoming partnership. If the partner is as big as they say, their IT department would have picked a decent project e.g. iota, nano, stellar or ripple anything tbh but verge.

So either the partner is trying to pull a marketing stunt, where they could have picked any crypto except verge or something really weird is going on. I have honestly no idea at this point.

Anyway, adoption is good for lowering volatility and that's something crypto needs right now. Regardless of what the partnership amounts to, I'm curious how this all ends.

"I‚Äôm going to repeat myself since you don‚Äôt seem to grasp what I‚Äôm saying. 

Please take a moment to actually listen to my words this time. His focus is on BCH because it has the technical elements that Bitcoin was supposed to have. BCH has the same color base, and block chain. It‚Äôs called a fork. Do you know what forks are for?

Those major, important technical aspects of Bitcoin that have been blocked by a corporation.  A corporation that came in and hired the top developers in bitcoin. So that they could force transactions off-chain and charge for them. 

You‚Äôre not aware of this? That doesn‚Äôt bother you? It doesn‚Äôt make your conscience uncomfortable? 

Well then maybe we have different ethics. But don‚Äôt get confused. Roger doesn‚Äôt hate bitcoin. Forks happen when the development team currently in charge fucks up. 

Forks are intended to take the ORIGINAL product and redirect it. Route around. Save the system. Yes you get a new ticker. But it‚Äôs still bitcoin. Don‚Äôt you understand this?",1523967315

If you are looking for some secondary sources at the end, there is a Youtube channel I like quite a bit and use in my freelance work (I write coin reviews) titled Topic: Crypto.

The trend is upwards, and in that, I completely agree. Regardless of when you buy, you will make money. 
Some are satisfied with that. Some are not. 

I'd rather test my skills against the market, to accumulate more of any given asset I'm interested in aquiring for the long haul, than ""hodl"". 

Let's say BTC started it's downwards trend at $100, why not sell at $90? Because it might swing up again? I'm not gonna teach you how to trade, but there are many things signaling a downtrend. Ofc you can get fucked, but.. High risk, high reward. 

Yes, if you hit the lowest possible point, that is luck. Nothing else.

The term bitcoin Jesus doesn't mean that Roger Ver is the force behind bitcoin and has come to save us (and is thus, a/the 'god' of bitcoin). Rather it is that his frequent and rampant evangelism resembles the ardor and fervor of Christian evangelizers and proselytizers.

So what you are saying is that bitcoin is saying but USD is volatile. Sure USD and every other currency has inflation. Which is exactly what Bitdoin could fight as you say, however right now Bitcoin is not the stable antiinflation haven it can be. The volatility is there. Saying it isn't is just stubbornness.

1. If XVG can get a big partnership that will be a huge boon to crypto in general.  Generally I think it could really set off a huge altcoin boom immediately.
2. It would kind of show that other coins are really fucking up by not going after a serious partner and landing one. Maybe motivate to try to compete instead of meming and arguing about tech.
3. It would be kind of funny because a lot of people are 110&amp;#37; convinced its a fraud and staked their reputation on it. It can be fun to eat crow.

**2\) Why accept Verge directly?**

This is actually the much bigger point and I guess we'll find out later if this is the case or not.

"Let's make this model even simpler and calculate the ROI for an average crypto-Joe:


Holding 10 000 Vechain costs 34 000 USD today.

This node generates 5.7 Thor Power a day, 2080.5 a year. If the price is is 0.5 USD per Thor you make 1080.5 USD by selling Thor.

1080.5 / 34 000 = 0,0312 = 3,12 %

If Vechain is a traditional stock, this ROI in dividents would be considered OK. But Vechain is a crypto, very volatile asset. Therefore the risk is much highers and MINIMUM 10% return is needed to mitigate this risk. This means that the right price for one VEN should be 1 - 1.1 USD. Non node holder will have even smaller ROI and higher node holders can take a lower Thor price due to bonus.

Unless Thor price is over 3 USD per piece, which would make it very expensive for the companies to us it, investing the same money into traditional stock market will give you same yield with 90% less risk.

"&gt; can 8mb block size handle the amount of transactions BTC was handling around December? 

It arguably wouldn't even have become a noteworthy situation with 8 MB blocks as if it would've taken much more transactions to cause a backlog. 

&gt; Are lower BCH fees just a consequence of their blockchain being less popular? 

No. With bigger blocks you can handle more transactions before the blocks are full and only on full blocks you get a situation where fees rise. That is because the fee determines your priority and the hihger the fee the better your chance to be included in the next block. If the block it big enough to accomodate all unconfirmed transactions then the fee doesn't matter. BCH aims to raise the limit so far that blocks won't be filled up and therefore fees should stay as low as possible.

&gt; Has BCH been tested properly yet in terms of lots and lots of transactions?

Only on test-nets. We've seen a few bigger transaction spikes that were handled quite well, though.

&gt; Can this approach work for scaling for mass adoption?

Yes. Think about it like this, with 1GB blocks we can rival the transaction amounts that VISA is handling and with a block every 10 minutes we're expecting 144 blocks a day. At 365 days for a year you get 52560 blocks. If we assume that all of them are 1GB in size youl' have roughly 52.5TB a year. 

Now this might sound like a lot, but right now we're struggling to fill 1 MB blocks constistenly over a year and by the time we'll see 1GB blocks there's a lot of time for diminishing the size of the blockchain (pruning) and bigger harddrives at a lower cost.

Yes that means that not everyone on the planet will be able to run a full mining node, but that isn't even the case today and it will still be affordable enough for a huge amount of the population that the network stays decentralized.",1523961780

The decimal point doesn't matter with Bitcoin for this task, it can be a smaller fraction than 1/&lt;number of atoms in a candy bar&gt; and still potentially be worth a candy bar.  That's why it doesn't suffer the same fate as gold; there is no point where the ratio of purchasing power to commodity is not feasible for transactions.  If you don't understand this, I'll explain it again, let me know.

&gt; What is your point?!?

See above; Gold suffers from a problem of non-infinite divisibility.  Right now, trying to buy that candy bar I would need to shave off .02 grams of gold (or thereabouts) to make that transaction.  That's *not feasible*.  So having physical commodities for a currency is *bad* because it eventually hits a point where the divisibility is a barrier.  This is NOT TRUE of bitcoin.

&gt; Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, hard to tell if you're trolling or not.

The OP made the argument that at some point we run out of the physical commodity.  That means that the divisibility doesn't work anymore and makes it hard to transact.  This causes a retraction of the economy *until more can get sourced*.  With bitcoin, IT DOESN'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM.

You seem to be missing this fundamental concept.  The potential of infinite divisibility with bitcoin means that even with a capped supply WE'LL NEVER RUN OUT.  No commodity crunch because there is no way to RUN OUT.

"**Doesn't matter if it goes down 80% next week**

I lol'd. Yeah, it does matter. If you want to make the big bucks, you gotta be able to pick the highs and lows +- 1-2%. 

Long positions have historically for the past 3 months, been a shit decision. Anything you bought at the lowest point in early feb, I could have bought 2 weeks ago at a 50% discount. Meaning, my stack is 50% bigger than yours, or of equal size at half the price. 

Now, imagine you thought this way about BTC. ""Ah, it went down from 300 to 150, doesn't get much cheaper than that!"". You blow $15k on 100 BTC. 2 months later, you see BTC at $2. Please tell me you wouldn't go fucking batshit over that. Sure, 100 BTC would still be a small fortune at this point. But holy shit, 7500 BTC would make you a filthy rich man right around now.

"Andreas does what he does because he wants to spread a message. Clearly he would rather fill 100% of the seats with people who want to listen to his message - whether they have the money to pay or not. He has chosen to allocate ALL the seats at the same price for this reason.   
  
If he allocated 10% of seating to VIP's then, as you point out in this thread, companies and organisations would pay for their employees to go, taking the seat of an interested individual. As andreas is interested in a global, bottom up adoption of bitcoin he values reaching individuals more highly than reaching employees.   
  
Your point about how conferences use VIP tickets to subsidise those who cannot afford to go is a good point - except that andreas has already stated that there are options available if you can't afford to attend. As such, there is no requirement to reduce ticket prices by selling VIP tickets.   
  
You claim that they have 'turn(ed) this into a political statement', but every action can be interpreted as a political statement. If they sold VIP tickets that would also be a political statement (albeit a conformist one).

"If 800k people browsing this subreddit and using crypto are going to make the whole financial system collapse then it deserves to burn.

On the topic of the 2008 crisis. You're right, the people were the ones that payed for it and it was the banks that caused it for their own personal gains. Guess what happens if you can't pay the loans you took? The banks take everything from you.

People don't know this, but in most of Eastern Europe prior to the 2008 crisis all the banks were only offering loans in CHF. So if you wanted to get a house with a mortage like all the US folk seem to be doing you needed to get the loan in CHF or move to a different country. Take a look at the CHF to EUR chart from 2008 onward and see what happened after 2008. Guess what? Even though it was worth more you still had to pay the same amount of CHF back. Enjoy your loans being up by 20% due to market manipulation. 

You do have a very US centric view. My family lost quite a lot in that period and it wasn't due to crypto or due to what 99% of the people were doing. It was due to market manipulation and a select greedy few. If we all had the same knowledge about banks and financial systems 10 years ago we wouldn't have had a problem, but I was pretty fucking young and most of us in Eastern Europe aren't that well educated anyway. 

The actual fact is that at least in most of Europe the government doesn't do anything useful other than collect taxes and not help you when banks are pulling this kind of shit. The banks are just a necessary evil as it's the only way to remember who owns what. Now that we have blockchain technology they stopped being so necessary. At the very least I hope they have some fucking competition. 

Personally this is a war for me. Fool me once shame on me. Don't ask me to trust that person or institution a second time because it is not happening. This isn't coming from a moral high ground.

"&gt;  There's millions of people in Venezuela right now that could benefit greatly from having better currency options.

i would argue they want a better SofV. I mean, cash is still working there as MofE - its the hyperinflation is the problem - which is linked to SofV of the monetary system, not the degree of friction of their currency system. 

&gt; But we're a lot closer to being able to bridge that gap than at any time in history.

this is a very big statement to make. I agree, there is a very appealing system (cryptocurrency) that has emerged, but i am not wholly convinced that we are on our way to making a better world. 

A lot of aspects actually worry me greatly about the industry - but they are a function of humanity more than anything. 

Removing central authority is all well and good, but if you aren't actually removing the root of the problems in society, all you are doing in decentralising them. 

&gt; When you study ""what makes a good store of value"" you find that stable currency is the archetype ""store of value"". So, ""means of exchange"" and ""store of value"" are not mutually exclusive, but a ""store of value"" implies that the thing will have transactional utility at some arbitrary point in the future. Here, cash is king except for inflation -- but we don't have to worry about inflation, do we?

look, this is a philosophy of economics argument, and we can go down that line if you want. I am willing to engage with you, as we have engaged before. I have actually thought about it a lot over the last few months, and really attempted to grasp what is actually going on, and what the sides of the arguments are attempting to convey. It is difficult amongst all the noise, as you well know. 

I am actually starting to think that SofV in the context is of crypto is different to what you are describing. What you are describing (and i think where a lot of the problems with the debate are appearing) are based on the framework of incumbent economics. 

Indeed, a lot of how the industry is trying to describe all this is built on legacy economic theory. 

I don't think the theory is all that relevant anymore. As technology has evolved, so must the framework used to describe it. 

I am going to point you to an emerging (but also somehwat neglected ) sub-field of economics. Here is the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoeconomics), a [nice intro article](http://natoassociation.ca/thermoeconomics-and-entropy-a-lesson-in-realism/) and here is a [book](http://amzn.eu/0ZczCh3). 

Now you may read some of that, and go wtf, and that is fair enough - but i thin you may well understand what i am hinting at. 

The interrelation between energy expended in mining (distributed security) and value (market driven forces) is where you may start to understand cryptocurrency in general (not just you, but all of us, and why it offers a better framework for understanding what the hell this is all about, and how we can frame the future in more grounded, and relevant theory.

"Wow great news. An Asian giant sees the potential in waltonchain. 
I Just don‚Äôt understand why mere peasants that scour Reddit on a daily basis still try to shit on waltonchain at every opportunity, for no reason whatsoever.

Why can‚Äôt people just recognise a good project for what it is. If people just recognise that a coin has excellent tech fudamentals, the team is professional and is delivering frequently with big news and that the project is making headway in its roadmap instead of channeling unfounded negativity, not just with wtc but with other coins too then they would be more likely to invest in good coins and earn better returns.

Being a ‚Äúfan‚Äù of a crypto is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. It‚Äôs not a sports team or a band, it‚Äôs an investment. Just sheer and utter herding behavioural bias and clear emotional bias on the part of these people.

If you can tick those three boxes (excellent fundamentals, evidence of professional team, delivering on roadmap) on any crypto you have made a solid investment. There is no need to get all emotional and partisan to a certain crypto, when all it is, is an investment. Do you think BP shareholders post daily on a public forum trying to undermine chevron, or do you think Goldman Sachs shareholders start slating any other investment banks and its shareholders, with no evidence but do it for the sole purpose to create FUD. No they do not, because in the world of capitalism there is a place for many players in all industries! Almost every capitalist behemoth has had some hiccups that has knocked there share price (Volkswagen, BP oil spill, many investment banks for libor scandal, Facebook data protection scandal), but all of these companies fundamentals hadn‚Äôt changed so all their share price bounced back as investors recognise that their stock was cheap and that they are solid investments. Compared to these scandals, Walton has had tiny minuscule mishaps and it generally related to marketing mishaps and never ever anything to do with the project or the excellent technology they are delivering on, yet it continues to get castigated. Does the world care more about that an intern sent out a stupid tweet or does the world care more about the largest social media platform in the world compromising millions of users data. Judging by the share price movements % of both Walton and FB, it‚Äôs seems the fickle people care about the former more.

So instead of throwing stupid comments up about a legit project, why not acknowledge the merits of waltonchain &amp; that goes for any other legit project! There is room in capitalism and crypto for many competitors, especially in supply chain space where the number of projects will continue to grow. WTC VEN MOD TRAC (Origintrail) are all great projects. It would take a very silly investor to form allegiance and become a ‚Äúfan‚Äù of one when there is returns to be made on all! ",1523959881

"&gt; I see this on other places too, but I find it alarming that so many people around crypto genuinely want to see the world burn.


I don't want to see the world burn so much, but Bitcoin have a value of 5 million per coin. That means I want Bitcoin to consume my fiat. What Governments will have evolved into then, we don't know. 


Will it be better than how things are currently? *Hopefully.* Is that scenario playing out at all? I think so. 


&gt; Just don't pretend you have a moral high ground because crypto ""is going to change the world"".



So the thing is really, can you apply what happened all throughout the last *decade* to the next few years also? As in will Bitcoin keep devouring cash? Will it stop? 



And I think the potential is there for Bitcoin to do that. And if that happens, then we don't have Fiat anymore. And if there's no fiat, there's no Government as we know it. It's inevitable. Call it greed, but if that greed works out, Governments will also eventually be gone - the way they are. 


&gt; Despite the news telling us every day how fucked everything is everywhere, humanity has never been in a better place.



No, the Western World has never been in a better place. You know what guarantees that peace? Nuclear bombs, because we know war among bigger nations pretty much results in a dead earth - loooong winter and stuff. That's why we have peace among the bigger players. No other reason. Besides that of course our environment starts getting fucked and we pray at the moment that more technological advancement will eventually make it so that we can cure the world, because current system is entirely unable to change.

Yea we have strong bombs. Other places don't have these bombs and are under constant war for the last 2 decades now. There's shit happen in India, all over Africa, ME, South America. These are places, where people live that are less lucky than you. Financial exclusion and hyperinflation are not myths from books. They exist in the real world too. And I'm aware of that and I know that Crypto can help these places too. 



Can some African use Bitcoin just like that and understand it? No. But we might get there. 


&gt;  If the US dollar collapses and only those of us holding crypto make it, I would be very sad to see all my family and friends lose everything they have.



That is the same logic when people tell you Bitcoin goes to 0. These things don't happen overnight. Look at you, you're early adopter and in Crypto right now. Of course your family will not be late in getting in Crypto. What price do you think possible in 3 years? Will you tell your family you made gains? Will you maybe change your mind regarding the dollar? Maybe you can get them into Crypto and make them rich? They all see how much money you made over these 3 years, you think they will refuse to buy forever? 



Same with Government. It doesn't just drop to 0 just like that in a day. It would lose control over time, and is immediately replaced by something better. That's why it lost control of X to begin with, because something else turned out to do something better than X. 




We're not crashing the system. It's simply evolution. 





I'm not Einstein, nor a genius or super smart. But Crypto made me question *a lot of things* about the world I live in. I start asking weird questions, that otherwise I would have probably never asked myself. I think that's part of the game, if you're in Crypto for longer. I think many people have experienced this just like me. How long are you in Crypto? Have your views regarding certain things not changed whatsoever? ",1523959745

"Technically it's approx 2X more expensive: the fees are calculated by using the same unit (Bitcoin/Satoshi). If you convert them to fiat then the fees would be multiplied by the exchange amount. The value (in fiat) of the Bitcoin is approx 10X the value in fiat of the BCH, hence the 2X fees multipled by 10 will turn into 20X. In example, if the BCH will increase in value by 10X, the fees will remain the same in BCH, but their cost in fiat will be 10X more expensive.

"&gt; There is no reason to think MoE hinders SoV.

this is not entirely true, though is for the most part. 

For example, if MofE means that everyone is using hot wallets, and are not educated on long term storage/cold wallets - this is detriment to the system as a whole. 

Also, remember you say the above is true. The reverse is also true. i.e that SofV does not necessarily hinder MofE. 

However, i do realise that e evidence suggests that it has in the case of BTC (mainly due to the technological gap that appeared when trying to move from robust SofV to scalable MofE (on BTC roadmap). 

This may well change when LN becomes operational fully (if you don't believe it will, fine, but let the evidence appear first before casting judgement. It seems to be going ok so far). 

&gt; Diminishment of one is diminishment of the other.

not true at all. and actually very simplified. 

You can have the best MofE in the world (i mean Venezuelen cash is pretty damn good still as MofE), but we can all agree its probably a pretty crappy SofV.

&gt; BCH will excel at both.

this may well be true, and i am open to this being the case. However, at the moment BTC is more secure in terms of hashpower. So by that measure, it is a better SofV. 

&gt; 1-3 years perhaps

from now? ok. if that's your timeline, that is fine by me. good luck!

"*Alibaba and Waltonchain confirmation means the FUD is as impotent as those I write about below....*


The amount of FUD this token gets is indicitive of a company that is seen as a major threat to its competitors.  In this case the campaign to undermine Waltonchain mostly originates from the Telgram Group called ChinaCrypto.info.  This group, led by a long time advocate of Waltonchain (aka Crypto FU, aka CREAM Crypto) is the person at the heart of the ongoing feud between the VeChain and Waltonchain communities.  He is also the person behind the insider trading at VeChain and the character ‚ÄòThe Coka Cola Kid‚Äô.   He and his lesser known associates, many of which jumped ship from Waltonchain under his spell, have recruited significant numbers of supporters who sadly dedicate most of their waking hours in attempts to damage Waltonchain.  His right hand man is know an Laowai and has posted below under his account Stockton_Slap209.  He‚Äôs a sociopath and has multiple accounts.  Single handedly he will be responsible for much of the FUD written below.  Yes, all from just one person!  Almost as impressive as his penchant for violence.

"A1: When we launched our token ICO back in August, we allocated 23% of the total supply to enterprise investors who are, at minimum, committed to using the VET purchased as a key elements in their business activities and network.
As stated in the financial report, the 33 million VET were deducted from the foundation controlled wallets during the period of Q4 of 2017, but it is not a reflection when they were actually SOLD, they were merely held by the foundation because some of the enterprise VET buyers did not setup necessary procedures to receive these tokens.
Again:
In fact, about 80% of the amount shown in the latest report were for previous quarter partnerships of some of our largest partners dating back to our ICO. The delay in delivering VET to these partners was contributed by the fact that these enterprises were struggling with setting up wallets that meet proper protocols, and/or establishing enterprise level regulations on their procedures. Figuring out how to manage the crypto internally for large enterprises, or government agencies, is a much more cumbersome process than on an individual level.",1523958925

Crypto isn't going to become the global currency in one snap - it's going to take time. Slowly more and more businesses will begin accepting crypto. This will increase with popularity similar to how we now can pay with our phones because companies have upgraded to cash registers that allow this. Next thing you know almost every major business accepts crypto and we've already hit mass adoption,1523958812
"We could argue on this for days, but at the end of day, they are personal opinions. I dont think real businesses (not just ordinary people) buy these projects based on bitcoin price, rather based on ""future potential"" by blockchain technology each company bring. Of course if you think blockchain is only bitcoin, you are right, but anyone can create a blockchain without bitcoin (many have already been created) so each companies should be valued separately. Asking everything to value based on bitcoin is something similar to asking to value every internet-based companies based on one company, but we dont have such a system, so if oneday blockchain technolgy becomes what internet did to the whole system, each project should be valued separately. If you think buying tokens are a gamble, you are right, but that's not the case for every investor. 
If the whole blockchain technology change the world as internet did, each project will be valued based on their use cases (e.g., bitcoin as the ""digital gold"", ETH, NEO, EOS, ADA as platforms for built decentralised projects, and there are 100s of other applications).
But I agree on one thing you said that these projects should be start ups and valued so, but since the whole blockchain technology is so early, people by them based on ""future potential"" due to fear of buying them at 100x price later.",1523958790

"What exactly is it about Bitcoin that you want to discuss?

The reason you haven't figured out who to interview is probably because you haven't figured out what you want to talk about.

Bitcoin in itself isn't a tight niche subject. I'd also get more than one person one...otherwise you'll have too much of a bias. This is why twats like Roger Ver always seem to be interviewed by themselves all the time. No need for him fight, all he has to do is repeat his own garbage propaganda.

For example, if you wanted to discuss the adoption aspect of Bitcoin, it's no good speaking to a developer, because they can't answer your question. You'd need to find someone already accepted Bitcoin and someone that wants to but can't and get both sides of the story.

Lets say you want to talk about the economic aspect of Bitcoin, you'd need an economist ornsomeone famiar with economic policy and impact. Preferably two, to get both sides.

I could drone on for hours, but I've run out of time. I hope this helps.",1523958675
"I think what you're trying to say, is very simple terms is: 


- People can't hold an opinion about a subject they know nothing about. 


I agree, but only to some extend. See, why democracies can work, but are ultimately probably inferor to technocratic approaches, is that these people can still listen to opinions of called domain experts. Perfectly fine. 


Domain experts in the field of economics *have* pointed out exactly why they think it's a scam. 


&gt; Or just a sheep nodding his head?


A big part of the reason why people invest in Cryptocurreny, is because their trust was lost during the time they had no other choice, but to trust the system that was given to them and not chosen by them. 


They are now here and bash the banking system and they believe Crypto is the shit. Whether that's logical or not is a different question, but that's part of the appeal. 


And you're pretty much here, saying they can't have these opinions, which different experts already had, because they can't explain economics in tidy and neat graphs like you can with your backgroud? 


Excuse me, but how do you think democracy works my friend? And if you don't like democracy, guess the technology which will enable us potentially to form new kinds of Governments? 



So what's your point? 



I studied ecnomics aswell. I wrote my Bachelor thesis on Bitcoin and future usecases. I don't think my opinion is worth me, because I do crypto full time now. I think most coins are shitcoins, I don't go to rcryptocurrency to keep on telling them their coins are scams?

Of course one can do opsec measures, but privacy should be default and automatic, not something that requires skills. Not to mention that since every transaction costs, accomplishing privacy in Bitcoin is rather expensive.

And thanks to this, Bitcoin becomes unusable in EU when GDPR privacy legislation becomes enforceable. You can still own bitcoin, but the only way you can use it is as unit of speculation, since no merchant can accept it. Due to the fact that all transactions are readable in blockchain.

It is almost impossible to do that, because the paper is extremely confusing and full of things that do not make sense if taken at face value.  At every step one must guess what it is that Craig was trying to say.

Asking scientists to refute a paper by Craig is like asking a wine taster to explain what exactly is wrong with the taste of spoiled tomato juice.

The first sentences of the Introduction read like this:

&gt; In the geometric construction of Eyal and Sirer it is claimed that ""a square is a regular polygon with four sides"".  In this paper, we demonstrate how this assertion is unsound. We start by demonstrating that a square is a triangle whose corners measure about 87 degrees, because that is best for arranging furniture.  That is, we demonstrate that people in square rooms can safely sit at the table.

He writes

&gt; The  use  of  assumptions  that  have  not  been  empirically  tested

The assumption of exponential distribution of block intervals (EDBI) follows mathematically from the mining algorithm, just as Craig's assumption of ""2^l has puzzles"".  That assumption has never been challenged.  

The actual distribution may not be perfectly exponential, because there may be details of implementation and/or the physical network that affect the block timings and are not accounted for in the protocol.  However, any deviations will be too small to affect the selfish mining strategy; and anyway Craig does not account for them either.  

&gt; and  the  extension  of  approximations  (such  as  the  Poisson  process  for  competing  blocks  instead  of the  negative  binomial,  Erlang,  or  other 

This is meaningless name throwing.  The mining process (as assumed by Craig too) implies an EDBI, not any of those other distributions.

&gt; more  complete systems

This does not make sense.  Maybe he meant ""more accurate models"". Or maybe he did not know what he was writing.

&gt; have  negatively affected both the Bitcoin system and the proposals that would negatively  impact the protocol

Another meaningless sentence.   Neither the original protocol nor the many later patches and proposals were **affected** by the assumption of EDBI.  No assumption was made about block intervals.  The EDBI just **followed** from the mining algorithm.
. 
Section 1.1 starts with what is supposed to be a description of the selfish mining strategy, but it is so garbled that even those who know it cannot quite follow it.  

He then claims that honest and selfish miners would **require** certain amounts of computing power in order to find solutions within a specified time.:

&gt; The honest miners  would thus  require 1/(1-alpha)  of  the  total  computing  power  they  control  to  find  a  hash  puzzle solution in the protocol-specific  time frame t,  and  the  selfish  miners would require 1/alpha multiplied  by  their respective computing power to individually obtain the solution in timeframe t.

That is nonsense.  A miner with any amount of hashpower **may** find a solution in any arbitrary time interval.  The probability would of course depend on the hashpower and time, but it is never zero.

So, again, maybe he meant something else than what he wrote.  Or maybe he did not understand what he was writing...

And the rest of the paper is all like that.  Sorry, but it would be a waste of time to go on.

And that is the case of all of Craig's technical writings, from before bitcoin -- including his Ph. D. thesis.  

Satoshi was not a computer scientist (my guess is that he had a Masters, but not a Ph. D.), yet his whitepaper is quite good by academic standards.  I wish that my grad students could write as well.  Craig is supposedly a computer scientist with a Ph. D., yet his papers are below garbage level.

"well shit, think about it: why would you buy at high prices? you always buy when things are down. stop following daily prices. it does not matter if you buy today and it goes down 80% the next week. who cares?

your buying decision should be based on your thoughts on the future price. if you think an alt is worth it and increase in price in the next years, now could be a good point to buy. why should you wait until a bull market where everything is expensive? bull markets are there to sell, not to buy.

be patient. markets are there to move wealth from fearful to patient investors. nothing else is happening every bull/bear market. buy when things go down (because the other people are afraid and sell cheap) and sell when everything is up (people FOMO the shit out of it and pay ridiculous prices just to not miss the train).

the whole last bull market was a prime example of this. people jumped onto the crypto ship and paid way too much (=high prices, high charts). then we got some selloffs and people panicked. now we‚Äôre back at normal, might even go down further. but as long as you‚Äôre confident that the technology will work out, we‚Äôll see other bull runs in the future.

"Woah I agree with everyone here. This is a terrible setup - for YOU. You have nothin to gain and everything to lose (the friendship/relationship, your sanity while stressing over the responsibility for their money, and least of all, the money itself) 
So I have helped multiple people invest into crypto (actually a lot of them being my friends‚Äô parents) so I know the stress of being put in a position to manage more money than you even own. 

First of all, if they don‚Äôt already have an account on an exchange in their names, help them set one up for themselves. They need a gateway for cashing out when they are ready to do so. But basically you also want to try and wean them off of their dependence on you for anything related to managing their funds. It‚Äôs healthiest when you‚Äôre able to just educate or guide, while they maintain control and responsibility of their own money.
2. figure out how to store the crypto in the mean time. If they want to be hands off then liscenced exchanges and insured exchanges are only ones safe enough to store. So for me I would personally never trust storage for long term in anything but Coinbase and Gemini. But there may be more options I don‚Äôt know about. 
If they want to be more hands on then you can get funky wit it and set them up with wallets and stuff. 

3. make sure you go through and consolidate every single transaction you executed with their money and you can clearly trace the complete money flow (fiat-&gt;crypto -&gt; whatever you did). You give a set of all these records to the friend. And keep a copy of everything for yourself. Especially that doc where you agreed to trade on their behalf. 

4, get a consult with a tax expert just to ask For clarification of your situation. You can probably even just book one of those 20 min initial consults with someone like [HappyTax](https://cryptotaxprep.com) (they specialize in crypto).
If your situation is pretty straightforward and you maintained clean records of everything, None of these should be carried as your tax burden. You could basically transfer the crypto to the other person, and given them their records to inherit and account for their cost basis. 
BUT I‚Äôm not a tax lawyer/consultant and if your situation is trickier they might be able to help you. If they don‚Äôt help in the consult, try and see if you‚Äôre able to ask your parents or someone you trust whether they can get you a appt with a tax expert they use.

- Achieving 1M TPS by having only a handful of validating nodes appointed by some foundation (that also holds 50% of the supply of some coin) sounds great and may have its use cases but it is in no way competing with something like Bitcoin.
- Doing transactions under the assumption that they are fully anonymous - only to find out later that loopholes have been found - can be pretty bad.

&gt; Bitcoin is politically correct

HA. It couldn't be further. Bitcoin is possibly the most politically incorrect form of money that exists. It is so politically incorrect it is regularly banned like books which expose and/or weaken the most tyrannical of governments.

You should maybe look up the [origin of the phrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_correctness):

&gt; As Marxist-Leninist movements gained political power, the phrase came to be associated with accusations of dogmatic application of doctrine, in debates between American Communists and American Socialists. This usage referred to the Communist party line which, in the eyes of the Socialists, provided ""correct"" positions on all political matters.

In ignorance of their ideological origins they too have adopted the same ideas. Not surprising, since such a state is required to maintain such ideas without being bombarded with constant obvious paradoxes.

‚ÄúThe fact that new coins are produced means the money supply increases by a planned amount, but this does not necessarily result in inflation. If the supply of money increases at the same rate that the number of people using it increases, prices remain stable.

But one thing that I'm wondering about is how would a crypto currency, say Bitcoin or maybe Nano idk be able to act as a global currency when time and time again a global currency has proven to be ineffective in comparison to national currencies? Like for example the Euro, while many say it is teething issues, it does have drawbacks in that one side of the currency is backed by industrial, highly productive manufacturing based countries like Northern Europe whilst the other half is based on tourism and consumer goods which are more prevalent in Southern Europe. 

Would this not be an issue? Or would different market prices in different countries fix this? 

And surely if this is solvable, wouldn't we be adopting BTC rapidly as a global currency seeing as the growing consensus is that we need a global currency? I might be wrong on this but this is an assumption that I see regularly on economics journals, etc.

They're a non practicing entity that's stockpiling hundreds of patents. They've also announced to use their patents in a discriminatory manner and that means they're going to spend a lot of time suing people. If it quacks like a patent troll...

&gt; If you believe patents are a good thing and you want to kill altcoins

You must be brain damaged to think that the cryptocurrency ecosystem has to pay rent to Bitcoin Cash. That's the crypto equivalent of starting a nuclear war.

If you don't already know what a huge clusterfuck software patents are, and you go ahead and setup a trolling company, there's no reasonable debate with that.

"Why do you think this will make a difference? Let‚Äôs take the following example using some fictional cryptocurrencies called XAA, XBB, and XCC. We‚Äôll ignore trading fees, but those are all tax-deductible in the real world, so reduce your taxes.

Trade 1:
You buy 10ETH to start for USD1000 total (USD100/ETH).

Trade 2:
A week later you sell your 10ETH and buy 50XAA for 0.2ETH each. When you do this, ETH is worth USD110 each.

Trade3:
Jump forward 6 months. You now sell half your XAA back to ETH. Luckily, your XAA has doubled in ETH terms and you get back the same 10ETH you spent, but as each ETH is now also worth USD500, you‚Äôve made boatloads of profit.

Now you take your 10ETH and you buy 2500XBB for 0.002ETH (USD1) each and 50XCC for 0.1ETH (USD50) each.

Trade 4:

December 31 rolls up and you decide to liquidate back to USD because screw cryptos in January.

The remaining 25XAA have cratered and are worth 0.04ETH each now, so you only get 1ETH for the lot.

The XBB sell for exactly the same 0.002ETH each you purchased them for, getting you your 5ETH back.

The XCC have done well and are now each worth 0.8ETH, putting 40ETH into your wallet.

To top it off, ETH is at USD1000.

How do your taxes work? Essentially you need to think as though each trade went into fiat even if it didn‚Äôt 

In the Trade 1 you started with fiat. That established a *cost basis* of USD1000. That USD1000 is yours and you never have to pay taxes on it.

In Trade 2, you sold ETH and bought XAA. If we think as though you went ETH-USD-XAA, however, because the price of ETH was USD110, you made USD100 in profit on that trade. That means that you earned USD10x10=100 in capital gains and now owe taxes on those USD100.

But!!!  The price you paid for the 50XAA was also stepped up to USD1100 (USD110x10ETH) even though it is the same 10ETH. In tax terminology, your cost basis for each XAA is USD22 now.

For Trade 3, you only sold half your XAA, but you made good profit. You sell 25XAA for 0.4ETH while ETH is at USD500. That means your sale was 25x0.4xUSD500=USD5000, and your cost basis was 25xUSD22=USD550. This means that you now owe taxes on the USD4450 in profit you just made. The good news is that this stepped-up cost basis is used for your purchases of the 2500XBB and 50XCC.

Closing out the year with Trade 4, let‚Äôs start with the taxes we know we already owe:

USD100 from Trade 2
USD4450 from Trade 3

ETH is now at USD1000.

The sale of your remaining 25XAA nets you only 1ETH or USD1000. Your cost basis was USD22 each, totaling USD550, leaving you with USD450 in gains.

The XBB sell for the same amount of ETH as when you purchased it, so you get 5ETH back. These ETH are now worth USD5000 and your cost basis was USD2500 (5ETH x USD500), leaving you with USD2500 in gains.

The XCC killed it, returning 40ETH to you at USD1000 each, so USD40,000. As with the XBB your cost basis was USD2500, leaving you with USD37,500 in gains.

Totaling it up, you made 100+4,450+450+2,500+37,500=USD45,000 in profit.

As these were all short-term trades where you held for less than a year, you‚Äôd pay your short-term capital gains tax rate on that amount. As you made more than USD37,950 in capital gains alone, you automatically get pushed into the 15% bracket. If your gains were smaller and your total income (including salary, etc.) was less than USD37,950, you would have paid 10%. If you‚Äôre doing very well and making more than USD418,401, you need to pay 20%.

So you‚Äôd pay somewhere between USD4,500 and USD9,000 in taxes, leaving you the rest.

A couple of notes:

In this example, I didn‚Äôt include any loses, but if there was a loss on a trade, it gets subtracted from your total gains at the end of the year.

Lastly, the example has the person cashing out to fiat (USD) at the end of the year. If they hadn‚Äôt, and had, to use a simple example, used the 46ETH to buy BTC, they still would have owed the same amount in taxes. This is the situation too many people put themselves into, so be careful and always keep or withdraw enough fiat to pay your taxes.

You can still file an extension tomorrow. It‚Äôs free and easy. Don‚Äôt get the IRS on your case.",1523953265

"&gt; They're not crippling development by only letting nChain employees develop on Bitcoin Cash (because Bitcoin Cash has multiple independent development teams

Why expend resources developing anything if you can just seek rent from anybody you don't like?

&gt; They're not arbitrarily limiting the block size to 1 MB to make the main chain unusable and expensive in order to force people to use their patented side chain / Lightning Network nonsense.

No they're just crippling all of cryptospace for their own benefit.

&gt; They patent their research and give it freely to anyone developing for Bitcoin Cash.

Today it's silencing critics by withdrawing their funding. Tomorrow it's suing anybody they don't like.

&gt; This means other coins don't get the technology which is good.

That's the silliest thing you've said yet. Cryptocurrencies are all in this together. Even the attempt to cripple other cryptocurrencies by patents is so damaging all around including for the ones doing the attempt (and anything they're associated with) it's akin to nuklear war. Bitcoin Cash will not survive that.

&gt;  I don't like software patents in general, but they're only enforceable in the country they made the application in (e.g. US)

That's incorrect due to the bilateral IP agreements that IP maximalists have coaxed their governments to negotiate.

"Well you always need to weigh upside risk against downside risk.

The altcoin upside is 20x and the downside is that some of them won't work out. The Bitcoin upside is 5x and the downside is that Nano's block lattice, IOTA's Tangle can run at several hundred thousand TPS like promised. If this happens or another cryptocurrency figures out high TPS, zero fees and instant transactions while maintaining decentralization, they will quickly replace Bitcoin.

Keep in mind, Bitcoin is a highly wasteful cryptocurrency with hours long transaction times and fees. Even if the Lightning Network works well, it is still inferior to a IOTA or Nano that works well, and will be replaced by it over time.

This way, while Nano and IOTA still have a risk that they lose decentralization when scaling up, Bitcoin is already very centralized with 3 pools owning more than 51% of the hash rate, so you could argue that IOTA and Nano are already a lot superior than Bitcoin and this superiority will only increase over time. https://blockchain.info/pools",1523953006

However consider what those pieces combine to make. Just because a single pieces price is less than a whole, doesn't mean the value of the whole pie is less, or that it's rarity decreases. There will still always only be a finite amount, and those infinitely sliced pieces will still not actually increase the volume, or cause the whole to decrease in value, because those pieces still make up that whole Bitcoin.",1523952645

"In general how would any crypto ward off the abusive use of patents? Seems to me if a company patents a useful method/system and especially if they offer it for free, many businesses may start to use it. Then it can get baked into a lot of infrastructure. FOSS-supporters can certainly refuse to use it, but businesses working for profit may not have the luxury of letting a competitor have the edge. And as software is likely to be developed more and more by businesses moving forward, I don't see a general solution other than crossing our fingers and hoping there are no patent trolls in Bitcoin's future. The issue isn't limited to nChain, although they are unquestionably the most vigorously pursuing IP. ",1523951655

Some people will learn their lessons from it but it will also scare people out of crypto altogether when they realize they've been duped.

That said, never talk to anyone about your crypto profits. I mean, ideally, *nobody*, not even family but certainly not friends. 

If you're crypto rich, you're a target. ""Be your own bank"" has implications, including the implication that it's up to you to safeguard your wealth. 

Getting hacked is one worry, but criminals have no compunctions about using violence, either. ""I hear that guy is sitting on hundreds of thousands in crypto. Let's go over there and break bones until he sends them to our wallet!"" Believe me, once they start on your toes with a hammer and work their way up, you'll no doubt give them the money after the first toe. Possibly the second. 

It's not just about investing right in crypto, it's also about being smart about it. The world is an ugly competition based place where taking money from someone is a really great way to get money fast. Well, it's great for the criminal, anyway, not so much the victim.

I'm not suggesting they won't coexist, but the uses of fiat will begin to dwindle away. Compare it to mail vs email. There's little reason to print your mails anymore. Mail companies have mostly transitioned to delivering packages. Traditional mail is only really used for legal bills these days (and even then, this is only required by them if you don't pay your bills, due to outdated laws which require they send you a paper bill).

Fiat will end up like paper mail. It might still exist, but only for the purpose of complying with old laws. Also, companies will price their USD in terms of BTC.

They want nothing more than to scale and attract new potential customers. Any project that intends to cross over and deliver Crypto to a user who provides value to the network through participation would be a smart addition for CB. These users would eventually look in to liquidating at some point. Coinbase knows this. It's probably not a question of which ONE of the tokens you mentioned they would add. As long as the project is square with the SEC, CB would benefit from all of their additions. Without looking in to each of them in detail, they all probably fit. The more exposure to Coinbase from the 99% of people who currently don't own any Crypto, but eventually will, the better. Thanks for this post. I appreciate it!",1523950181

I have found it is best just to pick the coins that you think will go up the fastest.  Making sure you have a privacy coin or supply chain coin may just gimp your portfolio because XMR doesn‚Äôt really moon, it is just steady and something like VEN is likely to bleed short term until mainnet release in June gets a lot closer.  Then it will dump after mainnet.  So just blindly holding VEN because you want a supply chain coin would definitely not be optimal.

"cool, so you bring something interesting to the table, so i tried to find info about spend and replace but all i found was this on wikipedia, which appears to protect the merchant from volatility not the consumer

&gt;BitPay enables merchants to accept bitcoin in payment for a transaction. Formally, BitPay enters into the bitcoin transaction on the merchant‚Äôs behalf, and converts the bitcoin amount to one of 30 currencies of the merchant's choosing.[67] Bitpay mitigates the risk of bitcoin price volatility by allowing the merchant to accept bitcoin which are immediately converted to a local currency. BitPay transactions are non-reversible, making it valuable for merchants who are working internationally. In 2013 it was announced that merchants could accept bitcoin and receive fiat currency the next day for a 0.99% fee.[68]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitPay

Thats actually nice for the merchant, a hedge incurring a fee of 0.99% is cheaper than the VISA fee.
