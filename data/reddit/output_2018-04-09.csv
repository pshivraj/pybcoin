The point I am trying to make is that you should start to do exchanges based on their price in BTC or Ethereum, not USD **unless you want to cash out**. Because, as I have pointed out, the price of Ripple dropped about 87% USD-wise, while it only has dropped 47% BTC-wise.

"I think what is often missed is that the internet was actually a pretty practical thing in early the 90s, and before then it was probably easier to see a practical application than it is for most people to see the point of crypto. 

I grew up with computers like the Commodore 64, the Amiga 500, and at some point got a 486... I remember browsing the internet for the first time sometime around 95. I think one of the first sites I started regularly visiting was Happy Puppy for video game reviews. By then, all of my friends I had introduced to the internet were totally into it and understood what it could/will be used for. 

Gone were the days of dubbing cassette tapes and covering the little hole on floppy disks so you could pirate your friends Amiga games! All of a sudden we could look shit up online and chat with each other and all sorts of crazy stuff.

In other words, I think it’s a mistake to convince ourself crypto/Blockchain/DLT is like the internet in the 90s. It’s more like we’re back in the 70s fighting the analogue vs digital transition. I don’t really think it’s like the .com boom, because pretty much nothing has a truly practical application or use in the real world other than sending peer to peer payments... 

I’m here because money but also I understand that DLT is some cool shit that could change the underlying architecture of some aspects of the internet. But I don’t believe for a second it will latch on as easily as the internet did in the 90s.",1523342351
"It really wouldn’t be massive at all. It can be performed against BCH with a minimal amount of BTC’s hashrate.  Remember, BCH only has about 6% of the hashrate of BTC, so a small amount diverted can have a significant impact.  This attacks not thwarted by the difficulty algorithm, either, since the block will be orphaned.  The attack is definitely more expensive on BTC, but BTC doesn’t have 32MB blocks, so the damage is limited to 4MB WU.  

You’re aware that it’s possible(and quite common, see almost every tech company ever) for a company or an entity to lose money for the first several years of its existence in order to carve out a market niche and eventually reach profitability by way of squashing other competitors or by obtaining network effect, right?

The small miner’s profit margin will drop, and mining often has quite slim margins to begin with, especially if you’re not a mega farm.

What really affects the small miner is the small block/high fees redesign of bitcoin.

Small miner have to mine much longer to afford the payout fees (paid two times). Fees easy eat up all your profitability unless you can afford large payout. Small miner can’t.

"&gt;&gt; usually you're able to send as much as you receive
&gt; 
&gt; Bitcoin by default maintains 8 outbound peer connections, and as many inbound ones as you allow. My node has 49 total connections right now. So it sends at least 8 times as much as it receives, but often 50-100 times.

I was talking about from your ISP, but you knew that already. If you're not a miner, it really doesn't matter how many people you peer with, because you don't matter.

&gt;&gt; BTC could fork tomorrow and all the segwit outputs could be stolen in a premine very easily, because anyone-can-spend.
&gt; 
&gt; Those blocks would be rejected by every node in the network. Hence why fully validating, non-mining nodes are important.

Not if the miners wanting to get rid of Segwit control a majority of hashpower. The it doesn't matter how full your node is, it's going to follow the longest chain. But you knew that already.

From the whitepaper:

&gt;The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity. Nodes work all at once with little coordination. They do not need to be identified, since messages are not routed to any particular place and only need to be delivered on a best effort basis. Nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone. **They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them.** Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism. http://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin/#selection-2129.501-2129.1118

If you run a full node, but aren't a miner, tell me how you express your acceptance or rejection of a block? How do you work, or refuse to work, on a block?

&gt; BCH could fork tomorrow and all the P2SH outputs could be stolen in a premine very easily, because anyone-can-spend.
&gt; 
&gt; See how stupid that is?

P2SH wasn't a contentious and unnecessary change.

&gt;&gt; retarded half measure Core did of just deleting whole blocks
&gt; 
&gt; You mean the same half measure every Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin Unlimited use? Can you point me to a single implementation that uses the method Satoshi describes?

I can't, because only the Core developers think 150 GB of storage is currently a problem.

&gt;&gt; Segwit made a second Merkle Root in the Coinbase transaction, which now cannot be pruned in BTC, unless you fork and remove Segwit.
&gt; 
&gt; What are you talking about? If old blocks can be pruned with the main merkle root, so can SegWit blocks with the second merkle root...

The Coinbase transaction itself can't be pruned, Segwit was essentially an expansion of the block header, without being a part of the block header. It puts data that should be in the header, into the coinbase tx. The fact that you can't understand why this is a problem, is itself ridiculous.

&gt;&gt; Segwit was a bastardization of the code in order to avoid a hardfork
&gt; 
&gt; SegWit was originally planned solely to solve transaction malleability, as a hard fork with no capacity increase. Then Luke-Jr figured out how to implement it as a soft fork and Pieter Wuille discovered an extremely clever way to increase capacity without hard forking. 

Doing it as a soft fork was only entertained after they saw the pushback from doing this instead of a block size increase.

&gt;Not only did it increase capacity, 

How's that increased capacity not that you've chased away most of the early adopting users and businesses?

&gt;but it also solved the incentives relating to the cost of creating UTXOs vs destroying them.

Wrong. UTXO set only started to go down once the mempool started clearing, and the fees went down.

&gt; I don't understand your blinding hatred. Well, I understand that it's based primarily on ignorance.

My views are from seeing this space torn apart by obnoxious gerbil-smugglers like Greg and Misguided Fanatics like Luke.

People who know fuck-all about economics, suddenly changing the economic aspects of a currency. People who ran bots to change wikipedia articles, suddenly being a part of the online discussion. People who, by their own admission, think Bitcoins ""value proposition"" is to be ""a store of value"" according to their circular logic. People who think Commodore 64s need to be able to run full nodes, which is the job of miners! (Okay, that last one is a bit of an exaggeration.)

Hmmm I don't honestly think we're in a bubble.  I believe we've just stalled and it will take progress in development for crypto to advance.  The projects will have to stop being projects.  Everything will have to work as advertised before it's adopted.  It may take years.  Not a single crypto is ready.  That's why I love cardano. It's slow and steady pace is best imo because is they're making sure it's perfect instead of just rolling out some half ass software.  You can't easily modify blockchain so taking your time developing it is the smart approach for sure.  I don't think we'll crash further but I don't expect massive gains either.

2. The 1mb blocksize will need to be expanded *eventually* as well; I always see these calculations about mass adoption always implying the 1mb limit is forever. 

Otherwise great comment, but it's implying BTC will never work and while scepticism is always good, there are still two sides of the scaling debate and discrediting either one is not helpful moving forward.

So that leaves us 2 options:
1. Government regulation
2. Self regulation

Self regulation is the way to go.  We set the agenda, not government.  All industries facing regulatory pressure start by trying to convince the government they can regulate themselves.

"You can “loan” money by margin trading. For example, if you have $100 to invest and you use 10x margin, it’s lke if you had $100 x 10 = $1,000. In other words you asked for a loan of $900 ! 

So if BTC price is $5000 and it doubles to $10000, you won’t double your $100.  You will double your $900 loan + $100 , so you just won $1,000 ( 10x more). If it goes to 15,000, you wont win 3x but 30x! and so on...

BUT... if it goes down, and you have 10x , you will lose your money if it drops a 10th part of the 100%. That means if it drops only 100%/10x = 10% , you lose everything. Why? Because you only had $100 , but you had a loan that made you have the power of $1,000 . How much does it take to lose your original money? 10% of that 1,000. Otherwise you would be negative.

Do dem hoes take BTC?,1523336688
"Exactly. We are taking the power and technology of the cloud and spreading it across the globe. This was evident with blockchain. But over time even this decentralized technology became centralized. From that spawned the many different blockchains we have now. As these mature, they will most likely start to centralize in some form or another. This will usher in the “cloud” era of blockchain with the rise multi-chains and interoperable chains. But due to the open source nature of these chains, it will probably have a radically more complex and profound network effect. 

Example using the regional bank scenario. Interoperable chain A might include Bitcoin and Ethereum and several other chains. But that inclusion into chain A doesn’t prevent chain B from also including Bitcoin. The combinations and possible nodes grow exponentially. ",1523336671

"35 year old ""millennial"" here.  10 years ago I watched people leave a giant office campus with boxes of their shit day after day, sometimes up to 20 at a time, for months on end.  Then I watched the stock market implode and real estate collapse.  Watched people miss their ""balloon payments"" or their ARMs adjusted and lose their homes.

As a 25 year old who already had doubts about the soundness of it all; thr system I mean- it left quite an impression on me.  I saved and bought a modest house in the 2012 bottom in my area.  My mortgage is less than what most people pay for a one bedroom apartment around here.  I figure I could pay it working retail again if I had to; always reminded of people walking out with boxes.

I've been lucky so far and have kept a decent job and advanced some.  The money I save goes into books, 1 oz gold pieces when I can afford them, and  into preps for when SHTF.  Between gold and cash savings there's around 12k and there's 15k in 401k money about as much out of the market as I can get it.  

I still worry it won't be enough to get us through the next shit storm without losing cars or the house, and we're in a decent position compared to peers in this area. 

 After watching bitcoin move with the markets quite a bit I don't have much faith in it.  It doesn't move like ""safe haven"" commodities do; but then again gold went down a bit with everything else at first so who knows.  I still feel the best move right now is to hold onto cash or gold if you have it and wait for opportunities.  

I'll tell you this, if both bitcoin and stocks both dropped 60 percent or more over the next year, I would buy a little bit coin but the bulk of my savings would go into stocks into companies with good top and bottom line numbers.  I missed out on the 2009 lows last time.  Not this time.  Bit coin, who knows- but this current cycle in the markets is coming to an end.  

If the current run continues to June of next year that would make a new record for longest expansion in us history.  Beating out the period between 1990-2000.  And that ain't happening because this has been the weakest recovery since the great depression growth wise.

"&gt; So... you're not planning on relaying those transactions to anyone else?

No, I'm not. I'm a selfish node! j/k you right, but usually you're able to send as much as you receive, so a 50/50 Mbps connection would be 100 Combined. And peering with 1 other node would be bare minimum if you're not a miner.

&gt;&gt; Not a problem if you compact the blocks as described in the white paper.
&gt; 
&gt; That's called pruning a.k.a. deleting data, and nobody has ever explained to me how SegWit ""breaks the chain of digital signatures"" but pruning does not.

It's completely different and you know it. BTC could fork tomorrow and all the segwit outputs could be stolen in a premine very easily, because anyone-can-spend. 

You can't do this with BCH transactions, because you don't have the private keys to generate the redeem scripts.

It is ""pruning"" but not the same as the retarded half measure Core did of just deleting whole blocks. Described in the white paper it's just deleting transactions that have already been spent maybe 2+ times over. A piece of the transaction will still forever exist in the block headers (which aren't pruned if doing it Satoshi's way) as part of the Merkle Root. You could still hold onto the transactions that you made in the past, where the coins have already been spent 1000 times over, if that helps you sleep at night.

Segwit made a second Merkle Root in the Coinbase transaction, which now cannot be pruned in BTC, unless you fork and remove Segwit. Because Segwit was a bastardization of the code in order to avoid a hardfork. This was done despite the fact that the developers knew it would hurt adoption and use of Bitcoin.

"Government changes - taxes and privacy in general.

We take it for granted that the government agencies can see our financial transactions and communications. We bend to authority. 

Governments abuse their tax payers. Both via harsh regulation/penalties and empire building via large spending. 

The governments realise it, but the population doesn’t yet. Cryptocurrency gives the individual a choice to not pay tax. It is effectively impossible to build a tax prosecution against an individual who takes cryptos as payment.  There will be black sheep slaughters - the same as with copyright prosecutions for using Bittorrent to copy movies. But ultimately the population will avoid taxation en masse. 

When people who run small and medium size businesses, online services, work this out, the government will lose huge swathes of tax income. 
When decentralized brokerages go main stream, the other half of the tax income will dry up. 

The G20 and other authorities dont care if individuals gamble their savings away. Do you see the G20 shutting down casinos? What they care about is their sweet government jobs. The regulation they want to impose is all about maintaining that tax teat. 

They know the genie is out of the bottle. They know they cant stop it. What they are trying to do know is get everyone onto the government blockchains.

The banks want to kill free market blockchain as well. Same deal. Blockchain will vastly reduce banking costs by simply eliminating banks. Every bank service can be performed on a blockchain Banks want to get you onto bank blockchains in order for banks to survive. 

Ultimately it wont work. They wont be able to stop the cryptos being free, and people will work out where the economic advantage is. 

Governments will become vastly smaller and incorporate ‘user pays’ for many functions. 

Both governments and banks have started to spend a lot of money to shake public confidence in cryptos. A lot of effort. 

Im talking 20 years. At this stage the tech hasnt even been properly developed, let alone adoption, let alone adaptation to economic advantage. 

Imagine it’s 1997. What will the internet do by 2017? 

Internet killed retailers, particularly anything to do with information. Bookstores, music stores, maps, video stores. Killed the TV and film production model too. Broadcasters. Dont get me wrong. Those things still exist, just not on the same scale. 

What the internet did for information, cryptos will do for information that you want to be private, and that information will have transactional value to the level of currency. The economics of crypto are far more incentivized. The tax rate locally, is proportional to the incentive to abandon it. 

Governments may have to restructure their taxation models like Apple and Netflix restructured media purchases to beat BitTorrent. 

Ultimately governments will never have that level of innovation, so they will have to co-opt an off-the-shelf crypto with an ability to bake the regulation in. 

This still wont stop mass tax avoidance, in the same way BitTorrent accounts for 25% of internet traffic worldwide. 

The fine tuning between the philosophies of Nozik and Rawls will be done on the blockchain. It’s fascinating!

"""Crypto"" is a meaningless buzzword. The actual term is ""cryptocurrency"". There are only a few of those and only Bitcoin (BCH) aka Bitcoin Cash is poised to become currency for the world. 

ICO vaporware lacks network effect, utility, 9 year track-record of uptime, numerous dev teams, mobile wallets, brand recognition, leaders and promoters, a sensible roadmap. Bitcoin (BCH) is the only cryptocurrency without a CEO, also.

Jumping onto a new coin or ICO token is not the answer. Real value and application of the tech needs to happen before we can reach enough interest to get there. However that will not happen for all coins, 90% of the coins are going to be worthless, but people who are HODLING blindly think a bull run will fix that.

"I respect you for responding respectively to everyone's post replies. I would say, there are some things that I would say worry me on verge.

-Roadmap shows merchandise store before ringct for a security coin.

-Dev has made quite a few blunders from the peercoin fix, to the forking that was apparently accidental (can't say for sure on that last part). He also went on twitter to let everyone know it was fixed after the peercoin copy/paste when him and everyone who knew what was going on damn well knew it wasn't.

-The fundraising, take it how you will, it seemed odd. That's an iffy one. The way the announcement was delayed, extremely shady.

A problem with it is there is such bad communication most of the time from the developer. He claims release times, and those fall through (happens a lot but doesn't excuse it), he claims fixes when there are none, he claims announcements then delays them. 

There are shadier crypto projects out there, but I would find it hard to argue this is on the edge of technology. It's not the worst but technology-wise and developer-wise I don't see how it beats xspec/monero/zcash/pivx, aside from a rabid fanbase which you could just get with something like Nano/Eth/Neo etc. I'd be happy to hear your side though.

"**Indiana Pi Bill**

The Indiana Pi Bill is the popular name for bill #246 of the 1897 sitting of the Indiana General Assembly, one of the most notorious attempts to establish mathematical truth by legislative fiat. Despite its name, the main result claimed by the bill is a method to square the circle, rather than to establish a certain value for the mathematical constant π, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. The bill, written by amateur mathematician Edward J. Goodwin, does imply various incorrect values of π, such as 3.2.

The bill never became law, due to the intervention of Professor C. A. Waldo of Purdue University, who happened to be present in the legislature on the day it went up for a vote.

"Personally I think the “death” of the American Dream can’t simply be whittled down to just monetary policy. 

The globalization trend over the last 50 years has done its part (while also adding new opportunities) and stagnating wages and rising wealth inequality. 

Bitcoin could help from the monetary policy aspect of the equation (however much or little that contributes to the problem) but Bitcoin likely won’t change anything regarding the wage stagnation or loss of jobs due to outsourcing (or automation down the road). ",1523331511

"it was a good conversation and I'll thank you as well. I use whattomine and I use nicehash but I constantly hear people say there is better knowledge/info/numbers elsewhere but I never hear where. I recently started mining again around the beginning of the year but these days it seems to not be a profitable decision or barely profitable at best. 
having said that is why I stopped years ago though ;)  
I only do gpu mining and mostly with amd cards which unfortunately they havent provided a stable -and- superior driver so it's fairly finicky and unreliable which adds to the pain factor. I may migrate slightly more to the nividia side. I also do archviz (and had done IT and heavy scripting in the past) so I may make a renderfarm out of the cards as well.  
  
I don't know enough on how eth works technically beyond the basic concept to understand most of your comment so I'll have to do more research on that topic as well but good for you as crypto clearly is a growing industry so you are likely very well positioned for the future.  
  
As far as the block times, I don't necessarily think that super short block times are going to separate one alt from another. It's not enough to just be technically superior in business. There is also a media and public presence as well that goes hand in hand as well as an ease of use/enjoy-ability of the product for the end user/consumer that are all primary factors for any product in which alts ultimately are... Products like coke and pepsi. 

Everybody who got into crypto in the last 6 months is taking a dive but if you got in prior to that like you and I then it should still all be mostly gravy even with todays current numbers. We just have to put the lambo back into the toybox instead of the garage at least for the foreseeable future (as least I do...). ",1523331297
I think you should clarify that in your post. Not letting customers use credit cards to buy crypto with the credit the bank is lending you is completely reasonable. Not letting you purchase it with your own money is not.

"I'll make some points since you're open for a debate. I honestly cannot see why someone would believe in Verge having any future in the long term. I cannot see any reason why they would request funds from the community to solidify a partnership (With a globally known company according to the developer.) 

What large company would say the follow? ""Okay we're interested in partnering up with you, however you must raise some money from your community first."" If they were delivering a product then this might make more sense, the large company want them to be able to manufacture and deliver the products with the money they gained from fundraising. But a partnership with a cryptocurrency? Ridiculous if you ask me. 

&amp;nbsp;

Even if this was something a company would ask for, why Verge? Why a cryptocurrency that already has a bad reputation for failing to meet deadlines? Why a cryptocurrency that has basically shown the face of one of their team members which has no impressive background whatsoever? Why a cryptocurrency that has no redeeming factors or infrastructure in comparison to the other privacy coins that are out there? Why a cryptocurrency that was recently attacked successfully for multiple hours if not over a day and accidentally hard-forked?

&amp;nbsp;

 If a truly professional globally known company were to partner with someone and associate themselves with a cryptocurrency, why would they choose to do so with verge, considering all of this? In my opinion, they wouldn't. Not only because of what I stated but because partnerships on that level that will supposedly ""change the crypto landscape forever"" would probably require some sort of corporate structure don't you think? Or do you see Amazon's executives and top employees sitting down with this single developer guy and his backwards hat? 

Also concerning, I read the developer's reddit post on taxes and coinbase. Assuming his gains were short term, he could very well be looking at close to a ~45 % tax rate. If Coinbase had those funds held  up, and you want to avoid a late tax penalty which (considering the amount he most likely tried to  cash out)  is a hell of a lot, who says he wouldn't make a desperate attempt to once again gather funds. 

I really hope I'm wrong but I fear that on the 16th they'll just announce a disappointing extremely over-hyped partnership or begin an exit. ",1523331083

"I don't think this is true. Minute the SM stops selfish mining they lose their edge and mining rewards start being awarded in proportion to hash power again. If you were an honest miner who could game the DAA at a whim by creating a 50% orphan rate you would get no benefit over the long term. 

Think about it. Let's say I'm such a miner and I have 1/2016th of the hash power on the BTC chain. 

1. I create a 50% orphan rate and get 1 block when 2016 blocks happen after 4 weeks.
2. Difficulty halves and I remove the orphan rate and now get my next block in a week.
3. Difficulty goes back to 2016 blocks per 2 weeks.

If I cycle this pattern I'll be earning on average 2 blocks / 5 weeks instead of 2 blocks / 4 weeks.

Selfish mining works (on paper) because the selfish miner has effectively more hash power than he really does because honest miners are being orphaned at a higher rate than he is. According to u/contrarian__'s [simulation](https://repl.it/repls/ObedientPhonyModularity), with 38% of the hash power the selfish miner can create a global orphan rate of 26.95%, and of that orphan rate, 3/4s of the blocks getting orphaned belong to honest miners and only 1/4 to the selfish miner.

That's perfectly fine. My statement was not a judgement for or against any one person using credit cards to buy crypto. Just that the widespread allowance of credit card holders being allowed to buy crypto is a liability. You may use it extremely responsibly whereas other people may have maxed out their cards in December fomo'ing into coins that were going to lose 80% or more of their value and now they can't make payments. ,1523330401

"Interest in crypto has just diminished because the gold rush mentality of something going straight up for a year straight died down. It’s still an incredibly early phase market with real use cases, none of the non speculative or trading value has been made yet. As I mentioned before the infrastructure, knowledge base, and regulatory clarity simply wasn’t present in Dec/ Jan when we people were predicting institutional buying to make this possible, and still probably isn’t if we’re talking about really big players. For instance coin base’s announcement that they’re setting up custody services is a huge hurdle, are major pension funds going to step in and buy crypto without having a truly secure place to hold it? Most capital managers wouldn’t know if they’re legally allowed to invest client money in crypto, ignoring other regulatory constraints, so you’re kind of left with really advanced super wealthy investors who can put up their own capital. That’s kind of a small club, and they’re also not likely to be the kind of people to catch a falling knife. But give it time and the possible investor base could massively expand.",1523330218

"There's centralization of hashpower to large pools but it's not clear that the actual miners are centralized. Especially with the [Chinese government having cracked down on mining operations](https://www.ccn.com/cryptocurrency-miners-may-move-out-of-china-following-government-crackdown/) the hashrate is likely more distributed than before.

**Hashrate tends to centralize in larger pools because this gives miners a more predictable and stable income.** A pool that has 0.1% of hashrate will have very unstable block generation rates compared to one that has 20% of hashrate. Most miners need to pay the electricity bills, so mining at a pool that only occasionally finds a block and then doesn't find one for a long time is not sustainable. But this doesn't mean that the actual hashpower is centralized to any particular data center or any particular mining operation.

I don't think Bitcoin is less secure than it was, if anything the sheer amount of hash power has made it much more difficult for anybody except the most powerful state actors to attack Bitcoin because of the sheer amount of electricity required. Mining pool centralization is due to the need of miners for a steady income more than anything else-nobody wants to mine on a small mining pool and have unpredictable income.

I honestly think we need more work put into distributed pools like p2pool to make them more competitive with the big centralized pools just so the hashpower doesn't excessively concentrate in centralized pools. And certainly new ASIC manufacturers would significantly improve the ability for new mining operations to come online, but Bitcoin is certainly not less secure than it used to be.",1523329353

And as it was a particularly contentious hardfork, which alienated much of the community, it has distanced itself from everything that came before.

Meanwhile, on the original Bitcoin blockchain, SegWit was implemented through a soft fork, which was completely backwards compatible with all that came before.

Hard forks are sometimes necessary, but when a hard fork happens, it's important that the community supports it with near-unanimity. Otherwise, it has the potential to undermine the very idea of Bitcoin.

"This is the real difference between today and the early technology discussions around the Internet. 

The average douchebag wasn't day trading the Internet to make thousands or millions of dollars. The people who questioned the tech either understood it or didn't. It was about information being readily available anywhere at anytime. 

Today you have complete bullshit conartists running entire crypto companies that do absolutely nothing. 

If you want to make a proper analogy this is like the 2000 dot com bubble. Some shit idea on a napkin and it's worth billions. It's not. The truth is that either right now, or very soon we will see a world that is post 2001 in terms of crypto carcasses. 

I for one can't wait for most of these crypto startups to just die. 98% of what is out there is complete garbage, being talked and shilled about by people with the equivalent of a high school education.

"Not that I’m arguing that there’s a bull run about to start immediately, but saying there isn’t enough capital to start a bull run is hilariously wrong... even at ATHs the crypto bubble was just a tiny blip on the scale of global financial markets. They were also incredibly illiquid during the last bull run. You need the proper infrastructure for both institutional and less tech literate retail investors to get into place before the money can flow in, but if crypto becomes useful and scalable there’s way more than enough money out there to make this last bubble look like child’s play.

"People hate ASICs but they also hate Bitmain. People hate Bitmain because they mine on their ASICs before they sell them. The problem with ASICs is you can only use them for mining. That means that your average person isn't going to buy an ASIC on grounds that it is expensive and cant be used for something more practical like gaming. GPUs, while they can't mining as efficiently as ASICs, have a practical, justifiable use (gaming) and a lower purchase price. They can also mine more coins. Since the average person can afford a GPU and can use it practically, more people will buy/have one. The more people that have GPUs, the less centralized a coin will be. You can see because there are mining farms that are GPU only and GPUs coins are still considered more decentralized. GPU mining is also better for consumers because they can switch to new coins with better tech. For example a guy with 5 S9s will fight to keep Bitcoin prominent because his machines can't switch. A person with 5 GPUs will be much more likely to switch from one GPU coin to another if they think that the other coin has better tech.",1523327470

"i'm hold some of these, but i'm going to ""bash"" them to try and create some discussion here.

BTC - Slow, costly, yes it's the ""first"", but so did gold. Lightning network appears to be a mess, as most predicted. 

ETH - Scaling issues are 1-5 years away from a fix, if ever. Not much to bash here.

Ripple: Centralized as hell, banks have no interest in using it at this time. Founders get 1Bil XRP every month...

Bcash: Bcash. LOL. (I don't actually have a side here I just like angering whiny Bcashers)

Litecoin: Forever a test net, there is no future where Litecoin lasts in the long term. If lightning works, BTC is perfect, no need for LTC. If it doesn't, then both BTC and LTC fail.

EOS: I don't know too much about this, other than that Dan has a history of not sticking around, and his past projects are all some variant of a pyramid scheme, he even tried making his own version of bitconnect iirc but then stopped after bitconnect got ""big"". oh, and Brock Pierce.

ADA: No comment, the majority of it is far beyond my comprehension.

Stellar: Centralized, less so than XRP, not much here to bash other than that.

NEO: I do remember reading that the cost of running a smart contract on the NEO blockchain was more than 99% of the world have in their savings account... 

IOTA: It's a mess. No one is taking their iota off the exchanges because A), it's very easy to lose your IOTA (or at least sight of your IOTA), there seems to be orphaned transactions that just get ""lost"", and B) they can't because the exchanges are having the same issues with their wallets. 

Monero: Ethical cons to supporting a network that enables the worst people on earth to transfer/hide wealth even easier, and privately. I never ""hodl"" XMR, but I do buy some when I need privacy on a purchase

"ltc's fee are something like a penny (maybe 1.5 cents?) and bch around half a penny so I would say both are already negligible.  Who is really complaining because if a 2 cent transaction? Seriously!  :)  
  
I would say the same argument for short blocktimes... they are mostly negligible and there is definitely a case to not make it too quick.  I don't have an opinion on what the right time should be but it should be a  balance of various factors. I don't need it to be seconds to be functional as currency but sure if eth can successfully do it at 15 seconds and still be good for miners and the backend than it is superior in that point but in a minor way imo.  
  
I would say from your perspective... Both LTC and BCH are clones of btc but LTC had the balls to change the name and build from scratch and the foresight to do it long ago. It doesn't have to be complex to be good. It serves it's purpose and in business terms the simpler is almost always the better. Ask apple about simplicity... 
Is bch more complex? Is the complexity worth the cost of being complex? not sure... 
  
I missed the boat on eth and wasnt paying attention to crypto when eth came into being... Just hodling. The concept of it is excellent imo and I hope gets somewhere because of it. I think the money case for crytpo is just the first use case and eth opens the door for other possibilities and ideas and I'm curious how blockchain concept will evolve in the future. I like the idea of making use of all the miners for real world problem solving instead of just balancing a ledger and wasting all the other energy.  I guess I'm fairly pro eth in concept but I'm currently not a holder of it. It may be the facebook to bitcoins myspace. It certainly has a long way to go though in terms of the public's consciousness of it though.

No question, that the majority of people who post TA are basically full of crap and it’s no better than  flipping a coin. I can only speak to my experience, which is obviously anecdotal. I will say this, the last few months have given me a lot of practice on identifying when BTC is about to take a heavy fall lol. The last 4 big drops I’ve been able to identify and tether up, then get back in before the next upswing, with moderately tight stoploss orders in case I called the bottom prematurely. Last night for example, there was a pretty clear RSI divergence on multiple time frames, with price moving up while RSI was going down. Sold 1/3 of the portfolio a few hours before the drop then bought back in at a cheaper price this afternoon. I’m not saying it’s going to work every time but so far it’s been a much better strategy for me than just holding 100% of my portfolio. If I were filthy rich I’d just DCA and buy on every dip, but I already used all the money I could afford to lose by the end of Feb. So I had to find another solution. I’d say my strategy is generally 2/3 hodl, and 1/3 trade using TA to increase my total number of coins. So far it’s going fairly well. Maybe I’ll have a different story in a few months. ",1523325853

"&gt;No it wasn't. B2X was unnecessary, rushed, and untested. It had one job and didn't even do that without breaking! Most of us are in favor of a block size hard fork eventually.

What actually settled it was many organizations in the b2x group ""discovering"" that ""upgrading"" the protocol does not upgrade bitcoin, it just creates a new coin, and that was the reason why many bailed on the proposal. 

&gt;If we can't PoW fork, then miners can change nearly anything about Bitcoin without anyone else's permission. Against a block size increase? Too bad, validate these extension blocks or else risk losing money.

how would that even work? Miners changing details of the protocol would just create another coin. Sure they can do it any time, but what's the profit in that? The rest of the network will just reject their changes. The only serious danger I've heard so far was a single miner taking over within existing rules and assuming the identity of bitcoin, which is nasty, but he still would be bound by existing protocol rules

&gt; We're discovering, not deciding, how all this works.

Absolutely true. And I think that we discovered a good method of hardforking during the final of blocksize debate",1523324816

"I've bought and sold and mined for 8 years, lots of profit sure but ultimately I went through my BTC transactions from 2016 and the sat/byte and total fees were super low.

BCH fees are lower than litecoins, even though litecoin is trying to push the fees down, BCH is doing even more to drop fees below 1 sat/byte.

I honestly feel like dumping my BTC stock if it hits 19k again (if ever) but I hold onto all my old keys for sentimental value.  I even dumped my BCH initially in august because I thought it might just be a fluke, then I re-bought back the same amount around $300 after reviewing all the individual dev teams behind it.

LTC is just a bitcoin clone with shorter block times and scrypt, it is nothing special.  I only still own mine because of the name and charlie lee's undeserved hyped, the code does nothing else that I know of or can find.

And, if you want to say LTC, say ethereum, it has similar fees and *fifteen* second block times, not 150 second blocktimes like LTC.

"CLee has said that he will enlarge the blocksize if truly needed but its not anywhere that point in the near forecast. This is not an LTC limitation or factor. Your points are pro bch compared to btc but not LTC as far as I can tell.  I kind of agree that the negative of enlarging blocks can be very detrimental to the internet itself just in terms of the added bandwidth straining the entire infrastructure of the actual net to maintain parity across all nodes across the entire planet... In realtime no less. Ive seen the math and it isn't pretty although I haven't done the calculations myself to validate. Just because your one machine can do it quickly doesn't mean the entire internet can do it quickly if pushed to that point and maintain that bandwidth. Do you think comcast is going to allow it's network to be crushed because a crypto coin just wants to maintain parity amongst every miner on the net sending 32 megs to every minor in the world every few minutes? it's going to cause huge real world problems for everyone if this becomes an issue.   I do somewhat agree that BTC on the other hand should probably slightly enlarge the blocksize. Actually, I would think this would be an adjusting variable as needed but maybe that's asking too much. (it shouldn't be)  I do personally think that this specifically was done as a way of BTC to profit for all the nodes and miners and hurts itself as a means of being a currency crypto. This, I believe, is single handidly the diverging point of btc versus bch. It's profit motivating the back end infrastructure and hurting the point of being a currency in one -business decision. This is where I agree with you on the original vision of bitcoin but I respect that the devs made a decision to profit their back end and convert the idea of btc to be more of a storage of value. I respect bch forking to maintain the original vision. I dont see this as a pro compared to LTC which always maintains this vision and option to enlarge if actually needed and I prefer them keeping it smaller as long as possible. LTC has always been meant is a means of currency (LTC silver to BTC gold was the original slogan) so it has been faithful to it's original intent and to satoshis original vision. Again, I don't see bch being superior to ltc here.  LTC already has more capability in the current size to be bigger than the credit card network of visa an a real world example. Lightening network probably helps btc more in terms of tech but helps LTC more in the sense of getting a larger userbase/usercase. It's not fundamental for it's use as a crypto. It's an additional benefit or a perk. I'll research your other points as I am not knowledgeable to comment but they all seem to be future tech and not currently in place. Certainly proof of work is probably the smarter decision for all coins but will be a sad day for minors. Maybe that research will change my perspective but I don't see BCH being superior to LTC either in concept or tech which was my original question and unless I'm missing something hasn't been answered here.

I have not used the lightning network. I have transacted both BTC and LTC and have some BCH stored from the split. All transactions have always been great across the board in my experience. I will likely in the future use BTC as storage and LTC for transactions as currently intended so I have no plans to use lightening network at this point unless to do it just to test it out.

By branding itself ""Bitcoin Cash"" and having its evangelists call it ""the one true Bitcoin"", the Bcash crowd fraudulently gets people to try trading Bcash as actual Bitcoin.

This leads to a lot of unfortunate scenarios where people think they're starting to get invested in Bitcoin, thinking they've found a sweet deal on some strangely discounted coins, when what they're actually buying is Bcash.

It also causes problems when newcomers try to send Bitcoin to a Bcash address, and lose all their coins.

Coming from a forex trading background. Currencies normally trade sideways for 90% of the time. Trends for the remaining 10%. Of course trading currencies(I mean traditional pairs like USD/EUR or AUD/USD) normally at least one of the 7 majors is trending. Now crypto is similar most of the time it is range bound then off it goes on a trend. However it is very hard to find a trending crypto while the rest are range bound as they all follow BTC's lead. So you have to recognise when they are range bound and trade accordingly. (Whew that was a lot of typing),1523322490

The same thing will happen with crypto; can’t change human nature overnight. 

However, crypto does and will completely undermine old money. It’s merely a byproduct of what happens when you go from scarcity to abundance. Just like how aluminum was stupidly scarce and became stupidly abundant, just like how communication was separated between mediums and only really from central sources and production of content could be done by literally anyone. Crypto makes it possible for the lay man to create world economies from an asset, spontaneously, governed by no one, and with a staggering amount of applications including but not limited to money. The music industry and print media are hurting pretty bad because of the internet but there is still value in content production and distribution.

It can be.

"&gt;Bitcoin and crypto still have a chance to succeed

Definitely. Especially because the U.S. (thankfully) is not the only place on earth.

But cryptocurrencies are not like alcohol or drugs or other goods which have been banned or highly regulated, which persist in successful black markets and eventually find legal and mainstream acceptance.

Cryptos like bitcoin are good for, and can succeed only along one major dimension: and that is money; a medium of indirect exchange, store of value, and a unit of account. Money is the ultimate network good, and network goods (though robust and anti-fragile once fully actualized) are tenuous and susceptible in infancy.  A bitcoin (unit) does not have much utility if just one or two people hold and try to exchange it instead of barter...yet that same unit has massive value (or rather, holding units gives you commensurate share to a massively valuable network of trading partners) if millions of people hold it and try to exchange it.

Most goods retain their full utility, even if they are banned...because its utility doesn't depend on how many others are using it. On the other hand, with cryptocurrencies: Governments can easily (and have to some extent) ensured that the costs of adopting the unit token are high enough to outweigh the benefits for the (non-ideologically motivated) masses...thus thwarting the actualization of the network effect and increased utility of the token as currency.

"**Foreign exchange controls**

Foreign exchange controls are various forms of controls imposed by a government on the purchase/sale of foreign currencies by residents or on the purchase/sale of local currency by nonresidents.

Common foreign exchange controls include:

Banning the use of foreign currency within the country

Banning locals from possessing foreign currency

Restricting currency exchange to government-approved exchangers

Fixed exchange rates

Restrictions on the amount of currency that may be imported or exported

Countries with foreign exchange controls are also known as ""Article 14 countries,"" after the provision in the International Monetary Fund agreement allowing exchange controls for transitional economies. Such controls used to be common in most countries, particularly poorer ones, until the 1990s when free trade and globalization started a trend towards economic liberalization. Today, countries which still impose exchange controls are the exception rather than the rule.

"&gt;None of what you just said affects the mathematics of the original paper. 

The mathematics of the original paper are based on the notion that bitcoin mining behaves like a Markov machine. The formulas used to calculate probabilities are derives from that notion. I'm saying that it is very likely that in reality bitcoin does not behave like a Markov machine, because honest miners will react. For Bitcoin to behave like a Markov machine then SM must be undetectable. But since SM is detectable very easily from the start, then it is unlikely that honest miners carry on with business as usual.

As result, it is very likely that the equations used in the paper, which are valid if and only if in reality the system behaves like a Markov machine, do not hold in reality. Therefore it is important to add a disclaimer to your simulation saying that the simulation is based on the assumption that bitcoin behaves like a Markov machine after the selfish mining pool is activated.

What I'm saying is very easy to understand. Maybe /u/Peter__R /u/deadalnix can chip in, I think they will agree. ",1523320663

"I've been down all these roads with you-know-who last summer.  

The assumption the Markov chain model is making is that the probability of finding the next proof-of-work for the SM is α and for the HM is 1-α (i.e., equal to the SM's and HM's hash power share, respectively).  It is like assuming who finds the next block can be settled by rolling a 100-sided die.  If the dice comes up greater than 100α, the HM finds the next proof-of-work; otherwise, the SM finds the next proof-of-work.

In reality, both SM and HM are hashing block headers frantically looking for a magic nonce to solve the bitcoin mining problem.  Last summer when this came up, it was not clear to a bunch of people that deciding who solves the next PoW by rolling a single die was equivalent to a hash race to find a special nonce.  And so we did a bunch of simulations to confirm that indeed the two methods are equivalent.  

If you understand memoryless, you can see that really the two methods have to be equivalent.  If two miners, one with hash power fraction 1-α and the other with α, start mining at the same time, it should be pretty obvious that the first will win with probability 1-α, and the second will win with probability α.  But since mining is memoryless, it doesn't matter at what time either started! It only matters that they have not yet solved a block (i.e., it only matter what Markov state they are in!).  For example, if the HM begins mining at t=-10 and still has not solved a proof-of-work by t=0, the HM is no closer to finding a solution!  The work he did, didn't count for anything. And so, the state transition probabilities are purely a function of the current state in the Markov model.  If they weren't, it would mean there was some ""memory effect"" taking place.  

Incidentally, this is the debate that lead to CSW and I betting over the [answer to this question](https://bitco.in/forum/threads/wright-or-wrong-lets-read-craig-wrights-selfish-miner-fallacy-paper-together-and-find-out.2426/page-2#post-41767).  He claimed that there was some ""negative binomial"" effect going on that resulted in the Markov probabilities not being static but dependent on what happened previously.  Once he published the paper on the topic, it was easy to identify that he was implicitly assuming that mining had memory without realizing it.  ",1523320448

"They wouldn't increase centralization of the miners, which is all that really matters when people talk about centralization. 

Unless you listen to the crowd at r/bitcoin, which thinks that every user needs to run a full node. That would be like every email user running an email server. It's extremely unnecessary.

As Satoshi also said:

&gt;The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.

In 2010: 
http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/bitcointalk/287/#selection-21.3-21.412

The fear of centralization is irrational, because the mining pools are already fairly large.

I know there is a lot of overlap with the poker community and the crypto community because...easy money right?

Imagine being dealt an above average hand, say 7-7. Now imagine that because you know it is above average you can decide to go blindly all in against a random opponents random hand AND you can bet 100x your stack size.  The board will be run say ten times, and if you lose on any one of the boards you lose your stack. Maybe you are ahead of most hands on a single run, and on average possibly on two hands....what happens when you run the board ten times? You lose your bet something &gt;99% of the time, more than cancelling out the 100x leverage. 

Now imagine that its possible that the other party knows your cards and can pay the dealer to stack the deck, or just for specific cards to be removed from the deck, since it doesn't take much to change the results in a major way. You don't know if it's really true that this collusion is happening, but you aren't making this bet at a regulated casino, but an underground game in china town. So it's possible if not likely that the collusion conspiracy has merit.

The thing is you are already participating in something that is volatile, has close to no rhyme or reason and is a gamble in and of itself. Then there are people that say...yup...dump some gasoline on that fire, cuz fuck it. It's possible it works out for me.

"No, if you see my post before CSW's article it is easy to see why it is very likely that bitcoin is not markov anymore at least after SM mining appears. 

In a Markov chain the probability depends exclusively on the state we are in now. If Bitcoin is Markov, this means that after SM activates HM **must** behave as if nothing weird is going on for the system to remain in the state of a Markov chain.

Since SM is very easy to detect, it is unlikely that HM will carry on with business as usual. Their reaction/reactions make the system unpredictable and non Markov.

If you are a selfish miner and HM carries on with business as usual (very unlikely), then once you have a lead of one your chances of moving to a lead of 2 are alpha.

If you are a selfish miner and HM **does not** carry on with business as usual, then once you have a lead of one your chances of moving a to a lead of 2 are alpha minus:

- the odds of the block being leaked
- the odds of HM adding more hashpower to decrease your ratio of the total hashpower
- the odds of HM teaming up and rejecting your blocks etc.

And other variables depending on what HM can do. These events are all unpredictable and if any of them occurs the system is not Markov anymore. Since it is very likely that HM does not carry on with business as usual, and the system remains Markov if and only if HM carries on mining as before, it is important to point out that your model is based on a Markov state which overwhelmingly unlikely to accurately depict what goes on in reality after SM activity is detected.

@Bob A @John Key  Ok lets bet $10 on your call. If it goes down to $10 I will send you one whole bitcoin, if it doesn't you send me one whole bitcoin. Would it be better to pay for your call now or at the end of the year?

"""Internet"" in this instance would be interpreted as ""internet access.""

Besides, you were always able to send Bitcoin without internet, by either sending an unpublished transaction, or by sending a private key. You could even send just the inputs, and the outputs can be changed by the receiver to whatever address they want.

This would be kinda hard to do though, but you could send this info in a letter, to be confirmed on-chain at a later date.

You only need to reach out to the Bitcoin network to confirm your transaction on-chain.

Sending Bitcoin without using an electronic device whatsoever, now that would be really difficult, (and I mean creating a signed transaction input, btw,) but it is doable. Eventually someone would have to publish that input on-chain though.",1523319355

"I’ll come back in a week tops to a 5k btc lmaooo 😂 capitulation doesn’t start until the credit card companies want their money back. You know, 22% of bagholders bought btc on credit, and 90% expected to sell their btc to pay for the charge. This was in january",1523319294
"Canonical transaction ordering (mid term) will lead to graphene block propagation (long term), and the bitcoin network can easily sustain the new 32mb blocks.  I just downloaded multiple gigabytes in minutes on my shitty internet (compared to the rest of the world).

1mb blocks are artificially limiting, but ultimately 32mb will sustain mid-term until UTXO database improvements are made (also in-flight for bitcoin cash) among other ideas.  Bitcoin/Blockstream created a ""problem"" to sell a ""solution"" (lightning network) and it is a poor design choice tech/UX wise in my opinion, bitcoin cash will just always function as bitcoin always did, in comparison.  Except it will be 32x more efficient power-wise because of how proof of work, works.

That makes it superior to me, because I've used bitcoin for 8 years, mined it for 8 years, and I want it to scale naturally as designed, not artificially limited with a segregated witness and payment channels that lock funds up.  Bitcoin cash has heavy hitters like Gavin Andresen (an original bitcoin dev) at the wheel helping, as one small example.

It's just all around a better option.  Have you used the LN before?",1523319272

And it's also ethically problematic as it creates the question which shouldn't exist, ""What's the criteria for unburning and distributing more NANO?""

To me this is #1 and I think it's more a matter of education than anything else. But having to look at 9fg8d89gdf8734hujhdfjghff7fsdfkjdfs to make sure it's actually 9fg8d89gdf8734hujhdfjghff7fsdfkjdfs and not 9fg8d89gdf8734hujhdfjghff7fsdfkjdfb before I send any amount of coin is just not good UX for the vast majority of people. Things like QR codes only go so far and phishing/scamming is far more damaging to users of cryptocurrency. People don't don't want to be their own bank. Even I wonder sometimes how foolproof my storage methods are. The first time I sent 0.1BTC from one wallet to another I was literally sweating. Those block times don't exactly do you any favors!!!

I'm interested to see where this all goes in a few years. I know we'll never have the ability to reverse accidental transactions like we do with traditional banks but there's a huge amount of comfort in know that if I accidentally send fiat to someone by accident, I can relatively easily reverse the transaction.

"This entire post is delusional fantasy at best.   
The whales who pumped at the end of last year did not get to dump all of their holdings because the price went down too fast (even they understimated just how top heavy the crypto market is with inexperienced weak hands.)     
That is the only reason prices are still at current levels (hence the side movement), whales are trying to create another pump so they can get rid of the last of their holdings.   
You have to be completely delusional to think any crypto is undervalued right now. They are all overvalued still. If the market were to move organically it would slowly move down to about 60% of its current value, but people are going to game it to create pumps on the way down.   
None of the cryptos are going to reach anywhere near the ATHs, not in the near future and perhaps never.  Reason is because there simply is not enough new capital (the order volumes are simply too low to even contemplate it).   
The capital that drove prices up previously can not be taken into account because most of it has been cashed out at a loss, and 90%  of the remainder it is people holding to their dear lives, they are not going to sell or buy anything until they get close where they entered the market, so essentially all that capital is frozen.   
All you need to do is the math, see the current price (of any coin), take the current total in circulation, then calculate how much capital would be needed to get that one coin back near to the ATH... yeah it is not going to happen.  
Now multiply that by the number of coins in the market. There simply is not enough new money that will coming required to get there.   
People need to wake up.

"again, it's a strawman to try to make it tech versus politics (I'll call greed). They are both factors.  
I disagree with BCH being superior on a tech level (how so?) and I disagree with LTC not having engineering behind it. Just recent topics of innovating especially right now with litepay and lightning network and integration with btc. How is BCH innovating? It's trying to copy a model from 8 years ago. Maybe I'm missing something.  
  
I didn't realize how big litecoin was until I saw this link:
https://coinatmradar.com/  
They simply aren't even comparable period. LTC is far superior. I was surprised when I first saw it myself. It's also notable that just about every bch location also/already has ltc in the same location but not in reverse. It is valid to say that bch is getting wider adoption though but it's still from being near LTC in real world adoption. This point is worth revisiting over time. 

It seems to me that every pro bch talking point fails just under basic scrutiny compared to LTC. Ive asked this before in this sub about comparing bch and ltc and it tends to just show the same flame/meme points over an over but I never can get a solid answer to how BCH is superior to LTC with exception to one thing... it has bitcoin in the name which is really a marketing (or as you would say political) point.  
  
the main conversation points tend to be: They tend to be similar to equal in most ways of the tech. The real world usage is vastly superior towards LTC. Bch has the name bitcoin (and bitcoins original ledger) going for it tend to be the real primary pros and cons of each. Basically bch just has bitcoins history as it's primary pro factors which I find crazy and ironic.  
  
I'm curious how lightpay and lightning network integration will affect things in the future but I don't think it can hurt anything unless it introduces too much complexity for the end user. These topics are also worth revisiting over time.

"I started my first Bitgrail account on December 19, and submitted for verification on 12/23 (or within a day of that). My recollection is that the withdrawal limits were yanked abruptly down from 10 BTC to 2 BTC on one level of verification right about that time, and unverified accounts were likewise reduced. In my case I was only able to do the .5 BTC/day withdrawals a few times during those rare windows in January when they were available.

I think Brola would have been able to withdraw his funds between Dec. 12-22 (roughly) if he'd been prompt about it, even if unverified. But at the time there was no panic about it.

"The [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5wwznc/please_read_our_frequently_asked_questions_faq/) says it clearly:

&gt;Bitcoin is commonly abbreviated as BTC, hence the name. The /r/btc reddit community was originally created as a community to discuss bitcoin. It quickly gained momentum in August 2015 when the bitcoin block size debate heightened. On the legacy /r/bitcoin subreddit it was discovered that moderators were heavily censoring discussions that were not inline with their own opinions.

&gt;Once realized, the subreddit subscribers began to openly question the censorship which led to
thousands of redditors being banned from the /r/bitcoin subreddit. A large number of redditors switched to other subreddits such as /r/bitcoin_uncensored and /r/btc.

Many users here have been in bitcoin since 2009. I joined in 2012.",1523316349
"&gt; However not all channels will or have to be public, and that's still far more nodes than probably all cryptocurrency nodes combined.

This isn't a very good comparison, FYI.  Node counts aren't very related to user counts as far as most of the research I've seen can find.  LN nodes need to match user counts, as there's no SPV / service-like option that they should be using.

&gt; Yes, Flare is one of the more promising methods. 

I'm not sure when you first read that, but flare doesn't seem to do anything in my opinion.  Flare's assumption is that there are channel updates that a user can retrieve at send time rather than passively.  There's no such thing as channel states aren't sent and fee rates aren't particularly important (though in theory could be used to communicate topology hints for routing).  So the only thing that Flare can split between passively tracked pre-emptively or actively retrieved as needed would be channel/node existence itself.  But that's pretty crucial to routing, and I'm not sure there's a way in the current design that you can even maintain a partial view of the network's raw exists/notexists topology.

Even if there were, flare isn't an order of magnitude improvement.  It just kind of helps a little.

&gt;  See section 3.3.1 Timestop. Basically, when the mempool is full and fees are rising, miners would set a bit in the block header which ""pauses"" relative timelock

Mempool is full and constant fees is the desired and intended state of Bitcoin under Core's leadership.  This bit would be set nearly all the time.  If this weren't going to be the case, the blocksize would have been increased with segwit2x or under some other plan that's making progress now.

I have come to believe the mass-default risk isn't quite as bad as I previously hypothesized, but it's still not a good point in LN's favor.

"Never go all in on one IMO. During this bear market I have rejigged my portfolio to an even spread of 6 coins that I believe will give me 10x gains in a future bull market. The logic was that each of my coins has good community support, have been as high as 10x in past history and offer good potential use cases. I try to stick to smart contract blockchain. However I figure if there are 6 coins that fit my criteria and potential for growth then by spreading my investment evenly in each I greatly increase my chance of achieving ROI. We have seen all too often how coins showing good potential can suddenly fall sharply in popularity due to hacks, FUD, bugs etc and this is why I will never go all in, not even on Bitcoin.

I don’t give a fuck about Roger Ver, the price of BTC/BCH, or what the majority of noobs who have been in the space less than a year think about Bitcoin Cash. It is the true original vision of Bitcoin that I signed up for in 2011, and the version of Bitcoin that makes the most sense to me as a programmer. That’s all I care about. ",1523315805
"&gt;IMO the ""right balance"" is zero government regulation. 

Yup.

&gt;I think they will find it difficult to regulate cryptocurrencies

Yup.

&gt;(rather than the interface points to existing systems) at all.

Here's where the vast majority of bitcoiners are completely clueless: The U.S. (and other governments, to varying extent) already heavily and destructively regulate cryptocurrencies (via capital gains tax and aml/kyc laws) and passively thwart it through regulatory and regime uncertainty (one of the main reasons why most insurers won't touch exchanges and cold wallets).

Crypto is dead in the water for use as currency, in countries like the U.S...and yet, as typical, most people (including most economists) remain willfully ignorant about the effects gov't has already had in keeping bitcoin a ""speculative asset only"", and love to disparage its supposed ""unregulated"" and ""wild west"" status as the primary cause of this.

",1523315779
"Transaction fees are very low right now. It's a good time to consolidate your small outputs into fewer bigger ones at SegWit addresses.

Then if and when the people attacking Bitcoin start spamming the mempool again pushing fees higher you'll save money by being able to spend from SegWit addresses rather than legacy ones.

Transaction malleability isn't a big deal for most people unless they're trying to spend unconfirmed change, chain unconfirmed transactions together, or think that tracking transactions by txid is a good idea.",1523315778
"&gt;Privacy is overrated

We couldn't disagree more. 

&gt;in practice it's not possible anyway

It's a sliding scale.  Right now, bitcoin is extremely traceable, while Monero is extremely hard to trace. Again, Bitcoin would be more useful if it had privacy enhancements.

&gt;Fungibility is a little bit more important but still dwarfed by the scaling problem.

Those aren't mutually exclusive. They are both things that need to be addressed.

If such a wallet existed, all merchants would be forced to stop accepting 0-confs",1523315741

You follow his youtube channel? He is hands down the best TA guy in crypto I have found. ,1523315562
"Since cryptocurrencies are so dependent on the fact that you are your own bank, I see mass adoption and replacement of fiat nowhere in the near future. Blockchain obviously will be used and is being used and adopted but we're a long way away from mass adoption of any cryptocurrency replacing fiat. There are a ton of smart people out there, so I would never rule out some crazy awesome shit developed to make using crypto easier but right now I don't see how you make something as complicated and difficult to deal with like crypto easy enough for normal people to want to bother. If you're content with saying ""you can't dumb down how to use cryptocurrencies"" then you're basically saying that there's no hope of mass adoption. ",1523315506
"That was a possibility before Bitcoin, now I don't think it'll be able to happen at the same scale. Because of Bitcoin we are able to collectively circumvent or at minimum minimize this type of manipulation for those that wish to participate in the new economy. What you are talking about is basically hyperbitcoinization, if that actually happens then Bitcoin immediately becomes new money pretty quickly and people will prefer to accept that over their government fiat when it is being devalued by the month.

When the buyer is interested in a trade, they will enter the rate. The seller will be notified to confirm the exchange rates and lock up necessary Bitcoin Cash into escrow.

The buyer will be notified to pay with fiat currencies. After receiving the fiat currencies, seller will confirm the receipt of payment and then release the escrowed Bitcoin Cash to the buyer.

"&gt;I mean, routing works today. Yes it requires the node to store information about as many channels as possible (it doesn't need all channels). 

*Sigh* if routing introduces UX pain and complexity, in addition to algorithmic complexity, which I believe it does, then it's not something you would automatically want to include just because you can. All other things being equal, simpler code is better code. I am not convinced the LN guys will be able to produce a scalable decentralized routing algorithm that works. The algorithm they have right now is not their intended final version of the algorithm, would you not agree? Given that routing is still a work in progress you're just wrong to suggest you might as well include it if you have the mini version of LN I've discussed.

However if you're already using HTLCs (which revocation/cheat detection requires), you might as well have the option to route payments.

A simple understanding of support and resistance lines has helped me heaps to pick good entry and exit points. Bitcoin bounces off these all day. Anyone who says they are worthless is simply not looking. I'm not claiming these patterns are due to some innate human physci, but as long as everyone is drawing the same lines it will make big moves when it hits certain trends. Obviously there is still uncertainty, but if you are going to be buying and selling any crypto it is stupid to dismiss TA completely.

I said previously that I have no problem with the forking or including bitcoin in the name. This part makes perfect sense. It's the after this part that gets really bad and shady and not just ethically but probably legally if it comes down to it and certainly financially for everyone involved. If this wasn't money and It was just a piece of -free- software then who would really care (actually people would still care but certainly from a lessor extent). I am hodling both as well but the bch tactics seem so shady to me that I find it disappointing for not just btc and bch but for the entire crypto community that I find it weakens the entire community over the greed of it and will likely shake out potentially adoption of new users over the confusion. As far as using as actual spending crypto cash - I actually prefer LTC which has a larger real world adoption than bch by far and overall similar cost and functionality and has been around much much longer. ,1523314155

It makes our hash algorithm immutable too. Have you heard of ""forced soft forks""? If we can't PoW fork, then miners can change nearly anything about Bitcoin without anyone else's permission. Against a block size increase? Too bad, validate these extension blocks or else risk losing money.

"Bitcoin has no value that is not attributed to it by a market. Pretty much all you have written there is amateurish foolishness based in some basic misunderstandings.

Government money is backed by obligation and they are the realest thing in the world. If you don't meet your obligation your assets will be seized to meet them. $1 worth of money meets $1 worth of obligation. Without obligation the money would have no value. Nothing but government money settles government obligation, which is why its value is carved in stone as standard of value. We trade money based in our shared obligation.

The average price of producing a Bitcoin is not the price to produce it now. It is the average for every one since inception. That value is pretty low and significantly less than what you have quoted. That amount is the floor upon which one can add some utility value.

"I do not think you give enough weight to the following facts:


1. While yes, Monero is a Gen 1 currency that uses PoW, it does have a dynamic blocksize and because of this, increased transactions on the network would actually reduce fees.  This makes the scaling problems that we have seen with Bitcoin last year to be very unlikely to occur to Monero in the short term.  Monero has a bigger concern about blockchain bloat as their transactions are much bigger than Bitcoin's.  Luckily this is being addressed somewhat with Bulletproofs. 

2.  The Monero Research Lab employees multiple PhD's to perform research on blockchain and privacy technology.  I find it unlikely that a major breakthrough in privacy technology will slip past the MRL for a time long enough where a competitor could gain a large leg up, unless such a development comes from the private sector.  

3.  Monero and the MRL is not stuck to PoW or any one technology.  They are constantly looking to bring forth a better product in terms of privacy and security.  This brings me to my next point.

4.  Monero firmly believes that privacy is the overriding priority, and is unwilling to compromise on this to increase scalability which many other privacy projects have.  


Yes, Monero is currently slower than other projects and has higher transaction fees.  This is a purposeful trade-off made to bring forth the most private and secure product to market currently available.  There is no other technology known that offers better scalability/fees without compromising or using unproven technology.  That is why Monero is currently the top privacy coin despite it's ""older technology"". 

I think that Monero has a very good shot long term as it is a grass roots, open source, community funded project that while is not perfect, is currently the best solution on the market, and is constantly looking technological breakthroughs.",1523313064

Its much different, and much worse, in the US.  In fact that is exactly WHY Bitcoin was made.   If my account goes negative by 3 dollars, I am charged a 35 ""over-draft"" fee instantly.  Then I am charged another 35 fee if I did not know about it and the account was still like that 3 days later.  Then if I havent checked for a week I am charged ANOTHER 35 dollar fee another 3 or 4 days later.

"&gt; Alex Bosworth came up with a clever solution to this, called a submarine swap. It's an atomic trade of an on-chain transaction for Lightning funds.

Go figure, I'm blocked from reading that tweet.  I barely even use twitter so that's pretty laughable.  Core power!

&gt; Bob, a merchant, opens a channel with Alice and wants to be able to receive funds through their channel. He offers her a deal: if she pays him 1 BTC on chain, he'll pay her 0.99 BTC via Lightning. In order to remove trust, the on-chain payment is encumbered by not only his public key, but also a hash lock (the same hash she provides him in the Lightning invoice). 

Sounds like basically a way to refill a channel with a single on-chain transaction.  An improvement over the current two, but not a game changer.

Is there something that prevents the Alice transaction from being broadcast too late after the timelocks expire?  I'm guessing so.

&gt; non interactive payments

I was interested in this because I read it as offline payments.  It doesn't seem like that's what this is at all, it's just a ""fire and forget"" payment that can't unwind, but because of routing problems that seems to be extremely unsafe to use.  Am I reading this wrong?

"actually, they are NOT breaking the impostor rules in the Twitter EULA:

&gt; We reserve the right to remove Content that violates the User Agreement, including for example, copyright or trademark violations, impersonation, unlawful conduct, or harassment.  

You'd say ""But wait, they are posting as @Bitcoin yet they only post about Bitcoin Cash and use it to openly declare that Bitcoin!=Bitcoin""

So the argument is ""bitcoin cash is the true bitcoin."" 

You cannot use the argument that bitcoin cash is ""derivative"" because both bitcoin (Core) and bitcoin cash have ""changed in nature.""

I'm setting my personal opinions aside to make this argument, because it is central to any open-source ""forkable"" idea.

If you have an idea that states ENTITY=X. 

Then you get a fork where only one tine of the fork changes: so now you have X and X(1). You still would state that ENTITY=X, and it is clear that the name of entity follows the X fork.

But say both tines have substantial changes and are the product of a base disagreement, you don't have X and X(1) you have X(A) and X(B).

The naming convention then falls under whichever tine has the most dev adherence and momentum. Obviously, it would be the devs that stay closest to the original resource pools: entitytalk.org, r/entity, entity.org.

If you then create, after the fact, entity.com, entity.com/forums, r/etit and so on, those are clearly secondary.

It would have been a smarter strategy to distance from the original brand as much as possible and ""live on your own strengths."" Instead, you have people all up in this shit, trying to poach the userbase, to misdirect, and to essentially ride on the coattails. That strategy is because there is a simple fear that the coin couldn't live on its own if it was branded differently, with it's own unique URL, and etc. People would look at it on the merits of it's development and think: FUCK YOU. Or it would just die under the weight of its own irrelevance. People might just see it as a ""hey I can increase my holdings by X% if I just get enough momentum to pass this off as real!!!"" and there you go.

That was my top concern with b'cash as an entity... if it was so superior, it would have absolutely no problem establishing itself as the true ""bitcoin path.""

This is absolutely nothing new in the open source, github driven market. I've seen this exact thing play out dozens of times on many facets of the same diamond: looney dev goes nuts and gets crowded out of his own project, fork is superior and supplants it with a totally different name... looney dev takes full control, fork cannot keep the spirit up and 1 person solo builds their true vision... fork happens that splits the devs and they end up making 2 shitty products in parallel that both fizzle and everyone wonders what happened to the useful thing... and so on...


but i have NEVER seen someone make a ""SimilarWare"" that actually means a shit in the long run. They take their short term gainz, use their notoriety until the well runs dry, and then are never heard of again. The only difference here, is the people perpetuating this horseshit are early adopters with relatively infinite resources to delay that ""fuck off nobody gives a shit about you"" by flat out paying for presence and creating thralls that know for every bit of disinfo they're able to pull off that makes their forkcoin that much more % valuable. 

In short, it only works as a short term (b')cash grab to align yourself so closely to a major entity. People would have much more respect for the vaporware project if it even attempted to stand on its own. 

Just the fact that their forum is a trollish misdirect towards the phony ""stock letter / abbreviation"" BTC (too bad that should be XBT reISO 4217) and not ""their own"" is only feeding into the narrative that it is the True Vision, but really, start your own fucking coin and rebrand it. 

A successful brand would EASILY be able to assert it is the True Vision without referring to the name.

Many, many, many products crash and burn because they only have name and not spirit/nature of the original product. The b'cashers seem to be fuckin stupid enough to not realize they're doing exactly what they're blaming the buttcoiners of doing...

Instead of going the elitist route with a new name and ""everyone smart knows this is the true vision coin"" they play this baby crying for mom's tit routine of NO THAT NAME IS MINE. I've never seen anyone, ever, argue this in court (from bands to products, IP or otherwise) not come across as looking like a fucking moron for trying to ""keep that brand recognition."" 


That effort could have been spent, you know, establishing the brand. It would be one thing if the b'cashers actually had claim to working on establishing the bitcoin brand... but they flat out did not. if anything, their collective checkered pasts and dubious involvements and dealings (proximity to scams + thefts) established bitcoin brand as ""black market money."" But yes, yes, that happens when you have massive investments in everything, right? You just are bound to be a part of numerous scams and thefts? LOOOL.

"**Ping (networking utility)**

Ping is a computer network administration software utility used to test the reachability of a host on an Internet Protocol (IP) network. It measures the round-trip time for messages sent from the originating host to a destination computer that are echoed back to the source. The name comes from active sonar terminology that sends a pulse of sound and listens for the echo to detect objects under water, although it is sometimes interpreted as a backronym to packet Internet groper.

Ping operates by sending Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request packets to the target host and waiting for an ICMP echo reply.

"Totally true. And in case bitmain actually dominates bitcoin, as things stand right now, I believe that it'll keep the name of bitcoin should a large part of community fork off. Bitmain will argue exactly like I do right now, and it is likely they'll convince the exchanges. In fact, the argument I'm using was the core argument against b2x. I'm just trying to formalize it

On the other hand, adopting the attitude right now gives some advantages in immutability of the protocol.

For instance. You cannot increase the block size in Bitcoin. Because increasing the blocksize will just create another coin. 

I think that right now the major threat to bitcoin is a lot of newcomers who believe that bitcoin has ""governance problems"" and who are willing to invest money in blockchains with ""voting"". And there always will be people trying to play politics, by, for example, ""improving"" btc by changing the block size or by changing the mining algo or by removing the 21m cap or by doing any other ""beneficial"" things they fancy.

Formally defining bitcoin as the original protocol will put an end to all of those ""improvements""",1523311712
"&gt; I don't see the relevance to my point.

My point is that pricing people out of crypto leaves the with no other option than to use state-backed currency. The third world is a huge market that could benefit greatly from Bitcoin, but if they have to pay post-2014 bitcoin fees they simply don't have any other option but to use state backed currency. Of course now, there's good low-fee alternatives like Bitcoin Cash and one or two other top 100 coins, but the main problem is getting that out to them. (Which CNBC Africa thankfully is doing a great job at)

&gt;You get nowhere with 0-conf. And its not any safer on bcash than on bitcoin. Pay the fee to get in the next block on bitcoin and its exactly the same.

Not at all. With bitcoin it's trivially easy to double spend because of high fees, long blocktimes and most importantly replace-by-fee. BCH removed RBF and guarantees everyone a spot in the next block, causing the cost/gain ratio to double spending on BCH to be extremely unsatisfactory for smaller sub 1-10k transactions. Right now Bitpay, Bitcoin.com and the vast majority of bitcoin cash-centered services accept 0-conf, and after we allow for sub-sat fees to be more easily propagated 0-conf will be about as secure as the network itself.

&gt;Yes, it was severely broken, and there was no way that bcash could sustain that amount of coin generation.


Bitcoin had more or less the same issue, although to a slightly lesser extent. Everyone switched to BCH and BTC was unusable for hours, then suddenly when BTC became a few procent more profitable and everyone switched back difficulty lowered, causing early inflation, repeat.

&gt;Its not been proven.

I mean, its what pretty much the entire crypto space has been doing forever. It's a objectively proven, predictable and secure way of scaling the blockchain. And worst case if it doesn't work out for some unexplicit reason, we can simply stop mining large blocks.

&gt;You are delusional if you don't think the bitcoin community is stoked about segwit being activated.

Segwit doesn't really do anything aside from tainting the blockchain with anyone-can-spend transactions, as a result allowing for slightly more data in the same 1mb block. I'd say whoever is left on /r/bitcoin and hasn't been banned yet might be excited for it, but its really just a hacked together solution to a problem that was solved in the first draft of the whitepaper.",1523311692

"Hell yeah! They just bought Poloniex and it will probably be based off that. Circle is owned by Goldman Sachs. So there is big money behind this that wants Crypto to succeed or this is some way for Wall Street to ""control"" the price.

I'm Bullish!",1523310540
"Comparisons between hardware and cloud based software are not helpful when extrapolating the future of cryptocurrency. 
For example, a lot of people use the VHS and Betamax competition when comparing Bitcoin to newer software like Dash. Betamax was superier technology, but lost the market to VHS, well basically because porn was on VHS and it was adopted into the market earlier. ",1523310454

you don't have to worry about that with bitcoin becausen not only is there no gold behind it, there's no anything else behind it either

so technically it's nothing, but because bitcoin has only a limited amount of this nothing it's worth something

scarcity is what makes anything valueable

so with bitcoin, scarcity makes nothing worth valueable as well

the genius behind bitcoin is that its an alternative currency to money, which means next to bitcoin, money doesn't really matter anymore

so the beautiful part of putting your money into bitcoin is that the value of your money, which doesn't matter anymore, goes up, while the amount of bitcoin you have which does matter, stays the same",1523310390
"I've invested in ADA and TAU. Both seem to have hugee potential, maybe they become the next ethereum.

2) I submitted KYC documents but was never verified

In some articles he’s being portrayed as a kind of security guru having super long passwords and encrypted drives etc. But that doesn’t mean anything, I know lots of “super sysadmins” like that and they barely know what SHA256 is, let alone being able to come up/contributing to Bitcoin’s white paper. That’s a whole different level.  
Sure he wrote a couple of books but nothing out of the ordinary or they suggests he’s even close to being a cryptographer.",1523309930
"Theres is a big difference from where BitCoin is now and where we see proper mass adoption of crypto. If there is developed a new cryptocurrency which is undeniably better in some respect to BitCoin (see- technological progress) then that is the one that will trigger and create the standard for that mass adoption assuming BitCoin cant integrate that new technology fast enough. A bet on BitCoin is a bet that that will not happen between now and that mass adoption point. Im not saying that BitCoin doesnt look like the strongest contender right now, mainly because of it's pure numbers and it has done well to stay the relevant standard throughout extensive innovation in the field. Despite this, it is still a gamble, a chance case. None of us know what the future will bring, and betting on the wrong outcome, over paying debts that are accruing interest is going to ruin a lot of peoples lives that is a guarantee. Whether that is believing in Bitcoin or not believing in bitcoin, there are a lot of smart people on both sides of the fence, and they can't all be right.",1523309929

Yeah but you aren't accounting for the leverage. GDAX and Bitstamp don't offer leverage from what I know. So every 1 Bitcoin worth of volume on those exchanges could potentially be 100 bitcoin on Bitmex.,1523309802
"It’s a mistake to curb the free market! You are confusing government influence and greed, maybe? Capitalism is a marxist term for free markets. Free markets have raised more people out of poverty than any other system, as far as i know. You sound like you want more rules. You sound like you want more government influence in Bitcoin, to me.",1523309786
The concept of bitcoin is amazing the problem is just like privacy no one gives a shit until it's too late,1523309761
"My claim is true because crypto currency increases economic freedom, and economic freedom reduces infant mortality. I’ve already pointed you towards the evidence, and you haven’t responded.",1523309710
"Why bother asking, just keep hovering up more top 10-20 coins every time it dips, then hold for 5-7 years, then retire. It’s an absolute guarantee. Stick to money you can afford to lose so that there is no incentive to sell, the bears will only control the market for so long... sooner or later their greedy hands will see eye watering cheap prices or they won’t be able to find anyone to buy from at dirt cheap prices. My guess at the moment is that bitcoin could hit 1-3k but I could be wrong so every month I just buy a little bit more because I believe in the practical application of the technology and the inevitability of use of the long term",1523309705

Hodling is pointless in bear markets we need more greater fools to make the market grow, but that only happens if the price rises and its not.

"Yes, eventually blocks will be bigger, when all the big efficiency improvements are gone and we still need to scale. 

Doing it the other way around means increased infrastructure costs earlier and more resistance by companies/users to adopt more efficient methods when it starts to get bad because ""why not raise the blocksize again instead?"".

I don't think the Lightning Network is at odds with the original spirit of Bitcoin, it's still a limited supply that can't be controlled. Satoshi himself talked about payment channels, which LN is based on.",1523309546

"&gt; If SM can win the race at all ever than gamma is greater than 0.

Yes.  There's always ways SM can win the race.  Even if they were poorly peered there's cases they'll win the race occasionally.

&gt; Is there any sense you can make of the notion that gamma can be negative?

No, that sounds like nonsense.

&gt;  It has repeatedly been observed by myself and others that gamma could be 0 and the paper would still have demonstrated that there's a 33% attack you can attempt to leverage against the Bitcoin network. C

Hmm, I'm trying to imagine in my mind, if Gamma was zero - aka you always lose the race - how could 33% become profitable?  I'm guessing because the SM is mining one block ahead while the rest of the network is behind and can immediately orphan if they get a 2nd block?

&gt;  the ratio of honest miners who accept the SM's chain during the race, is a negative value. 

I don't understand how that could be negative.  If 0 out of 100 miners accept it, then it is 0.  If 100 miners out of 100 accept it, then it is 1.  The range is between 0.00 and 1.00.  How could it be anything else?",1523309491
Your not sending millisats from an onchain BTC wallet. You fund a lighting channel with a 1 sat+ transaction and then you can send sub sat amounts on there since your on lightning.,1523309490
"hmm, I thought that I made the argument pretty concisely already.  Bitcoin is better than fiat, but it needs to be adopted to be relevant.

Square has a business case for increasing bitcoin adoption.

the issues that you mentioned aren't really issues, they are some of the best parts of our current banking system.  More and more people are doing online banking which really has a lower cost of ownership than the big ol corporate banks.  Any bank is creating a simple user experience for moving money around.   Your third point confuses me, I would consider crypto pretty capitalist.

One existed before the scandal and the other after it. Not so simple like YOU would like it to be.

He cheated trying to be considered as Satoshi. Maybe for some reason he couldn't get the necessary evidence so he tried shortcuts (for greed and/or glory), or maybe he deliberately ruined his reputation for an unknown purpose (maybe ideals or paranoia, whatever). Maybe he's just a pure scammer. But that doesn't mean beyond any reasonable doubt that he isn't connected to Satoshi. As for me - I don't care if he is Satoshi or not. I read him becuase I think his ideas are interesting and that's the only reason which should count. And mentioning this fact is what you desperately try to tag as ""Shilling"". In general I don't like the tone of the mobs in the two subs claiming without proof that he ""doctored"" his left foot to become Satoshi.

"Nah - it isn't an invasion of privacy for you to contextualize your ""bitcoin dream success story"" by giving a region.

I am asserting that what you are claiming you do is 100% impossible to do in any country in the world unless you are breaking laws AND/OR passing the bitcoin buck by selling your bitcoin to some entity who is converting to fiat for you.

And by the way, that's basically idiotic to do and only possible if you are an earlier adopter cashing in on the multiplier. If you do that after buying in at $20,000 that's a lot different than buying in at $20, for example, so it isn't a ""general strategy.""

For example, even the act of getting ""paid in bitcoin"" by an employer. They are not paid in bitcoin. They're paid in fiat and are converting to bitcoin to hand over to you. And when they do that, someone else is cashing out of their bitcoin (not hodling). And there are fees associated all along the chain, so you are basically getting paid less than you could be because of those conversion rates. Never mind the inflation of people building in capital gains taxes if applicable. (I get a sense you're in europe, so that's probably not).

Shrug. That's why people are responding to you the way they are: you're speaking as though you're living some sort of universal strategy when in reality you're just passing the fiat buck and either illegally taking advantage of some laws or in a jurisdiction where they don't apply.

The @bitcoin account very clearly wants followers and Twitter users to believe it represents the “real” Bitcoin and does so with marketing speak, such as saying that “Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin”.

"&gt; Under normal operation in this case, HM is going to win the race against SM more often than it loses.

If SM can win the race at all ever than gamma is greater than 0.

&gt;That aside, I'm inclined to agree with both of you to a degree. I think that the way the Bitcoin network is structured now provides it a great deal of protection against any selfish mining attacks except those which selectively orphan a target's blocks, in which case the cost to the attacker is directly proportional to the cost to the attacked pool.

When the SM paper first came out, it was assumed that unless something was done, like making it so that in a race miners randomly choose a block, which increase the minimum hash power before profitability to 25%, then for all we know gamma could be some very large value and the SM could be profitable to do by an SM pool with even very low hash power levels.

Craig has suggested, plausibly, that because of developments like FIBRE, that have led to strong-connectedness in the network graph, gamma is not very large. I have not disputed this claim. Nor has anyone else. It has repeatedly been observed by myself and others that gamma could be 0 and the paper would still have demonstrated that there's a 33% attack you can attempt to leverage against the Bitcoin network. Craig's claim in his presentation is that this is untrue because gamma, the ratio of honest miners who accept the SM's chain during the race, is a negative value. Despite innumerable apologies for this perspective, no one has succeeded in finding an interpretation of this statement by Craig where he is correct. 

Is there any sense you can make of the notion that gamma can be negative?",1523308447

"Sure. 

Solar and storage are, to me, semi-decentralized in their current form. You either have solar panels and batteries on grid and controlled by utilities while paying out to the property owner, or completely off grid and the economics is up to the property owner completely. The decentralization comes in it’s distributed generation; it isn’t centrally located so the management of such systems is a problem for grid operators to manage at a large scale. In my view Crypto enables easier management but also can allow the ability for people to do other things more easily like islanded micro grids with less dedicated hardware; the exchange of electrical transaction information between trustless parties can be done with less friction using crypto. For example, elon musk’s australia battery is actually handling electrical demand faster than they can even register due to the fact that batteries can ramp up in milliseconds compared to like hours for natgas/coal plants, and as a result tesla doesn’t get paid properly. A public ledger is in my opinion a good solution given the global market tesla wishes to serve.

"Time. Nobody can time the market... just time IN the market

Basically my theory of investing (in anything largely traded) is that nobody knows wtf is going on. I'll use the stock market since it's more ""conventional"" and there is more data.

Think of how many really really smart people there are all trying to do the same thing. They are all looking at the same data and trying really really hard to make a good decision on the value of stocks. When you have that many people doing the same thing the outcome is usually going to be pretty close to the same thing... it becomes almost an organism itself.

So if it's all the same... and nobody is theoretically any more informed or better than anyone else... how do I chose? The common denominator is fees. I can't pick which adviser or fund will be better than any other one (because nobody knows wtf)... but I can control the fee that I pay.

This is one of the primary reasons that low cost fee index funds have become the norm for ""smart"" investing.

Anyway, no Bitcoin is not a majority rules system. Majority hashpower determines the longest chain for a given protocol, but what protocol is used is an individual decision. A network is a consensus between individuals who all choose to use the same protocol.

So now that Bitcoin has forked into two (the original scaling roadmap vs the original code), the @bitcoin account, which a Bitcoin supporter has been involved in Bitcoin since 2009, and has controlled his Twitter account since 2012, is supporting one of those versions of Bitcoin. 

Both versions are supported by people who believe in Bitcoin, and both should be allowed to be promoted with the respective supporters' internet properties.

Interfering in the marketplace of ideas by taking an account away from someone supporting of the two visions for Bitcoin is totally counter to a fair and open debate.

It's all well and good if you're shunning both the protections and the restrictions of the Evil Capitalist Overlords... but don't pretend that everyone wants to bother doing that.

The problem with ubiquity regarding cryptocurrency is that you have 0 to lose if you enter into it later. Eventually if everything is crypto all you're losing out from is that mythical ""huge multiplier"" that fewer and fewer people benefit from as the valuation erodes. If in X years all your fiat turns into GovCoin there's no penalty for not involving yourself with crypto beforehand. 

Especially if, in that endgame, the existence of GovCoin and other major outlet coins AmazonCoin, FacebookCoin, AppleCoin, GoogleCoin (nevermind ChaseCoin, CapitalCoin, HSBCCoin) conspire to basically make all other coins flat out illegal to deal with, closing down all ""legit"" exchanges.

The best case scenario is what, exactly? That those exchanges are taken over by these new powerhouse legit exchanges and obsoleted? Or that the gov declares ""ok they're all interchangeable without these cap gains taxes, hooray!"" 

In some's mindset the best case scenario is centralized government fiat is reduced to rubble by crypto... which, i mean, that'd mean the gov itself is reduced to rubble... which... uh... you wouldn't really have to worry about ""legislation"" at that point, because we'd have bigger infrastructural problems if that occurred.

"but at that point there is 0 difference between bitcoin and your digital transferring of DigiFiat because you've removed the decentralization from the picture.

Will anyone give a rats ass when you can pay with PayPal Credit or Bitcoin when the thing you're giving up is your fiat? It is literally irrelevant to the purchaser and only allows those people funneling bitcoin into their hands to do it more efficiently.

It's a pretty simple issue:

1. People already have bank accounts + use digital fiat
2. Purchasing bitcoin just to hand it over adds extra steps and fees, requires additional knowhow and security... especially come taxtime which is another double digit fee.
3. Most people aren't interested in overthrowing the capitalist regime, many people don't even see how legitimizing crypto via KYC/AML regulation even matters or what that accomplishes.

It's an offshoot that may be trying to go back to the original intents of the founders of bitcoin. If this was the official bch slogan and outcry, I would be behind it 100% but it's not.

"&gt; How do you figure? HM broadcasts to all miners including SM. The broadcast has different latencies for getting to different miners. SM sees the broadcast before some set of miners S, and a subset of that set of miners S' it has lower latency connections to than HM does. 

Jumping in here at Zectro's request to clarify a few things.  Disclaimer:  I'm not a mathematician and I'm not deeply versed in the SM attack vector nor with CSW's presentation.  That said, I'm well versed in the mining, network configuration, and computer science of the problem.

Under normal operation in this case, HM is going to win the race against SM more often than it loses.  This is because the act of finding and transmitting the block leads the act of receiving the blockdata.  Unless you're both flat out better peered and flat-out lower latency than the majority of the network (very unlikely at these cost scales with the fibre network), you're going to lose the race slightly more often than you win it because the HM block is already in transit by the time you've got it.

Even worse, most hashpower on the planet is sitting on public stratum mining feeds.  You and other miners are probably watching eachother's stratum mining fees for a change in blockhash, that's what caused a brief chainsplit a few years ago.  So not only does the selfish miner have to have latency/connectedness advantages over their peers, they have to have enough private hashpower that is *not* sitting on public stratum feeds to give their blocks a viable chance of winning.  That's really fucking expensive and difficult to do at these scales.

Non-mining relays don't really factor much into this.  Miners large enough to be important in this scenario will be directly peered, either manually or through the fibre network.

The non-mining relays do factor in for the selfish mining ***detection.***  They increase the chance that the orphan block might propagate to allow the orphan to be recorded on a blockchain explorer for SM analysis later.  This is also true if any blockchain explorers are lucky enough / capable enough to get on Fibre and/or peer directly with the selfish miner (some do/will), or watching stratum feeds from the miners.

That aside, I'm inclined to agree with both of you to a degree.  I think that the way the Bitcoin network is structured now provides it a great deal of protection against any selfish mining attacks except those which selectively orphan a target's blocks, in which case the cost to the attacker is directly proportional to the cost to the attacked pool.

That doesn't mean SM isn't an interesting topic for discussion or that it isn't possible.  It could become possible, especially if the assumptions of directly peering or equivalent latencies begin to be broken, or way back in the day before mining was such a huge cost.  If those assumptions are broken, it comes down to how much of an advantage the attacker is able to gain over their fellow mining pools - If they can see the competing block very early in propagation and start propagation themselves much faster, they can win more often.

The reason I think we should be able to make those assumptions is the cost scales involved in large scale mining.  If you're trying to outdo fellow miners, you an add servers at $500 per month(at most) in different geographic locations to get better connectivity.  But after adding 15 or 20 servers in 10-15 geographic locations, there begin to be severe diminishing returns on how much better connected you get.  Adding another server provides you essentially no benefits whatsoever.  So beyond spending $7,500 to $10,000 per month there's no real point.  For a mining pool with $20,000,000 a month in revenue, $7,500 per month is a rounding error.

This is nothing like that. The account was controlled by someone who has been a Bitcoiner since 2009. 

Bitcoin had a legitimate divergence in opinions on scaling.

The original scaling plan was to scale on chain, as stated by Satoshi himself:

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=287.msg8810#msg8810

&gt;The eventual solution will be to not care how big it gets.


The Bitcoin Core developers, after pushing out the lead developer Gavin Andresen and Core developer Jeff Garzik, have changed the roadmap from on-chain scaling, to off-chain scaling. There was never any community-wide consensus for this change in roadmaps.

So now that Bitcoin has forked into two (the original scaling roadmap vs the original code), the @bitcoin account, which a Bitcoin supporter has controlled since 2012, is supporting one of those versions of Bitcoin.

"**Sergei Mavrodi**

Sergei Panteleevich Mavrodi (Russian: Серге́й Пантеле́евич Мавро́ди; 11 August 1955 – 26 March 2018) was a Russian financial fraudster and previously a deputy of the State Duma. He was the founder of the МММ.

In 2007 Sergei Mavrodi was convicted in a Russian court of defrauding 10,000 investors out of 110 million rubles ($4.3 million). Mavrodi claimed he was not the beneficiary of the donations and that he was not used to a flamboyant lifestyle. The charge of which he was later convicted was tax fraud though he claimed that the MMM scheme was not a business, but instead a mutual donation program which there is no law against.

FYI the weight limit is a proportional limit, an accounting anomaly it is roughly 3/4 the size of the 1MB limit. It is used to measure the ratio of segregated signatures in a block to no segregated signatures. 

Increasing the weight limit to 8MB would not allow any more transaction in a block. the maximum number of transactions is dictated by the 1MB Non-witness data limit (aka the 1MB block limit) 

the Weight limit effectively allows for bigger signatures, not more transactions. Transaction capacity is still limited to 1MB. A marginal 1-time increase in transaction capacity was achieved by moving the signatures out of the 1MB transaction limit. I say marginal increase as at most a 75% increase in transaction capacity could be achieved assuming 100% segwit adoption. 

As far as I can tell the 1MB transaction limit can't be changed without causing a fork. Implying a chain split when the 1MB fork is altered. ",1523304789

&gt; In the other you're setting up a mutually locked system where it is extremely difficult for them to take your money 

... or the channel fails without routing, or any hop along any route can attempt fraud on the channel. That's a higher risk profile than simply risking  the funds with the merchant: you're now risking them against *the whole Lightning network*! You're not just risking fraud by your commerce partner, you're risking fraud on the part of other participants. I mentioned this already and you didn't seem to see it. This leads to the broader problem I have, but first:

&gt; You can do the same thing with a LN channel and reduce your risk profile even further.

It's not any lower, it becomes the same at higher expense. You still have to monitor the partner or close the channel to secure your funds.

---

**The Elephant In The Room**

In a word: Routing.

Currently, to route a payment, a node must have a complete and up-to-date map of the entire network including all channel states. *All* of them. Even armed with this wealth of information it is impossible to guarantee 100% routing success thanks to liquidity limitations. However, this means that *every node knows about every other channel in real time* (barring the technical limitations that open other attack vectors). For a thousand nodes, this is already a significant burden for node operation - in an ""ideal"" scenario with millions of participants, the current routing algorithm will not work at all. However, there is no known better solution to the problem - in fact it is one of the greater challenges of modern computer science, easily as great as the Byzantine General's problem. Whole-system routing won't work - it gives every potential fraudster information about exactly where to position their channels to cause maximum impact through forced closure. Even without attempting fraud, a third party unaffiliated with the commerce involved can disrupt or prevent a payment by simply refusing to answer. And that brings me to the second unsung problem..

**The Elephant's Daughter**

In three words: Liquidity Disruption Attack.

A highly-liquid node is capable of positioning themselves in a high-traffic part of the network by simply opening channels. They can then become the most attractive middle man for routing on a large scale easily and (setting aside centralization issues) arbitrarily prevent payments that route through his node(s). Other participants can only, at best publish closure transactions to recover their funds, and await confirmation. The payment will be denied and the channel will shut down irrecoverably. The attacker can do this at very little or no cost and continuously maintain control channels without hashpower. The only way to prevent this attack is for enough liquidity to route around the attacker; yet the attacker will be the most attractive liquidity partner on the network and will be able to easily trap the unaware.",1523304521

My guess is that true mainstream ‘adoption’ will come in the form of most people never even seeing the underlying technology that blockchain affords them. Many people will live their lives interacting with blockchain and crypto tech without ever knowning it, and only the industries with actual use cases will see crypto survive for a much smaller portion of people willing to ‘invest’.

"You don't understand how probability works.

&gt; How do you bypass the 'first seen'-rule?

If you think that saves you in any way the rbtc misinformation machine has been very effective. You simply send the tx at the same time. As propagation through the network is not instant there will be a race for the two tx to reach the different destinations. And you've also got a problem with these brilliant Bitcoin XT node implementations that simply relay *every thing they see*. A miner could tap into that network and just mine whatever tx he sees with the highest fee.

&gt; The main question is, how do you increase the success rate? 

Pretty simple. Identify mining nodes, send your double spend tx there. Attempt to identify the merchants node - if he's a local guy try to send it to a local node. That will probably increase your chances of the double spend getting mined, and the merchant only seeing the ""real tx"" that wont be mined.

You might have a harder time tricking a real payment processor because they can have setup deals with miners to monitor their mempools, and they most definately run a network of nodes listening for double spends. But if this is the model you wish to pursue, then you're not really your own bank any longer and you might have better luck using paypal.",1523302602

*****
&gt; Cryptocurrency and blockchain themes have gradually started popping up in a number of mainstream productions recently.

&gt; The Big Bang Theory similarly touched upon cryptocurrency in its last season, devoting an entire episode to Bitcoin - though some have since pointed out the show got a lot of things about blockchain wrong.

&gt; Unlike those big-time productions, Buy the Dip targets an audience more closely familiar with the mad world of cryptocurrency and blockchain: it is a production for cryptocurrency enthusiasts, made by cryptocurrency enthusiasts - and that is precisely what excites me about this short.

Easy: its off chain. Imagine you pass IOUs back and forth to friends for various fractional satoshi amounts. Until you try to settle on chain with real bitcoin, you can do whatever you want. 

You could own each other donuts, and cats, and billionths of a satoshi, fictional characters, whatever you like. So long as you have a way to round it to normal bitcoin units before settling up, it doesnt matter whats written on the IOUs.

In LN: after each LN transaction you round off an agreed settlement position with your partner, so everyone knows what will happen if it settled.

Even if Lightning turns out to be the crypto equivalent of an airplane, BCH is a world without even a TSA security checkpoint. (Considering fees at channel open/close as a checkpoint.) Bitcoin (2009-2016) has proven to be decentralized, whereas the roadmap BTC is on now seems easily gamed by banks/large actors at the most inappropriate moment: after adoption by a large community of people. I worry this outcome won't reveal itself until Lightning has a large multiple of transactions vs those recorded on-chain. Fees much more than a penny seriously limit the uses of bitcoin that can't be shoehorned into a Lightning model.

Many coins are more unstable than even the worst currencies.  And ultimately, unless people in those places start to mine, they won't have access anyway because the transactions will be blocked by the financial system so they can't buy any of these coins in the first place...

Bitcoin happened ,1523300760
What if we're still so early into crypto that no dumb money has entered the market yet (ever) and that's a year down the road when BTC is 50k?,1523300729
"Yes, I know. Last year when BTC was 2k it wasn't an issue Becuase miners had no option other than continuing to mine at less profit (or worse, stop mining). Currently there is a competing chain for hashpower, BCH. If BTC were to drop in price, miners currently have an additional option they didn't have before: mine a more profitable SHA-256 coin, BCH for example. If the BTC or BCH were to lose a significant amount of hashpower block times would decrease, Further reducing profitability. BCH has DAA which has proven to dramatically decrease the difficulty factor in times when hashpower reduced quickly (ie the Aug 1 fork). BTC does NOT have this feature. BTC has no way of compensating for a sudden loss of hashpower.

If the price of BTC were to hit 2K and miners started to redirect hashpower to more profitable chains the difficulty adjustment period (2016 blocks) would take longer than 2 weeks. all the while blocks are taking longer and longer to solve, further reducing miner profitability, further causing slower block times. If it gets bad enough, the block adjustment period may never be reached and the chain will enter a chain death spiral. BTC cannot survive a dramatic drop in price, while BCH can.

This is a fatal flaw that was not relivant last year. Bitcoiners will not have an opportunity to exit, there will be no bank run. Just a bunch of bag hodlers blaming Bcash for their ill-fated coin and bleeding butt holes. Of course this is all FUD right? Do the math. Prove me wrong..",1523300717

"&gt; Microtransactions

.. that require pre-funding. If I plan on making microtransactions, I don't need Lightning, I can pre-fund an account with the merchant directly and expose myself to less risk overhead.

&gt; frequent payments between parties

... that require a highly liquid network between them that is capable of routing large volume, something that you already said Lightning won't do.

Still not seeing it. Let's assume the microtransaction use case because it's the most plausible right now. If I want to accept microtransactions I can:

* establish a Lightning node
* get a liquidity partner to open a channel with me
* accept micro transactions
* wait for their confirmation before spending, or use them in outbound microtransactions

Or, I can:

* establish a Bitcoin Cash wallet
* accept 0-conf payments directly to user accounts
* spend the payments immediately and freely
* enjoy a lower risk profile

If I want to make microtransactions, I can:

* establish a Lightning node
* fund a liquidity channel to the network
* send microtransactions
* close the channel when done and await confirmation for fund recovery

Or, I:

* send Bitcoin Cash to the merchant account
* transact directly with the merchant
* withdraw remaining balance from the merchant for immediate spending on demand
* enjoy a lower risk profile",1523300512
"&gt; Alice is a normal person. She just wants to pay for something. She finds out she needs to run a Bitcoin node 24/7 or there is some other thing called a watchtower that she has to trust with her money.

She does not need to be online 24/7 and does not need to run a Bitcoin node. If a dispute period for a one-sided channel close is let's say 7 days, then she can connect to the Internet maybe once per day and her wallet application can check the blockchain for recent one-sided channel close attempts. If a fraudulent channel close attempt is detected, then her wallet application can post a punishment transaction and claim all funds from the channel.

There is no strict requirement for running a full node, even though having a full node is definitely safer than an SPV node and it may be a requirement for some early LN applications just because they don't want to deal with some extra complexity yet.

A watchtower has no control of Alice's money, but is only authorized to send a punishment transaction on Alice's behalf if a fraudulent channel close attempt is detected. The worst what may happen is that the watchtower just fails to do its job. That's why it's a good idea to have more than one watchtower just in case. The watchtower only gets paid if it successfully catches a fraudster rather than a flat subscription fee.

And finally, in this Alice's scenario (""she just wants to pay for something"") she does not even need to watch for one sided channel close attempts at all. If she never intends to receive money from her channel, then ""Amazon"" may only cheat itself by broadcasting a stale channel state (effectively reverting some of the recent Alice's payments). It's ""Amazon"" who needs to watch for fraudulent channel close attempts in this scenario.

&gt; Bob makes $2000 a month. Bob is lucky. He's richer than 90% of other people on the planet. His employer pays his salary in Bitcoin using LN. Bob pays $1000 rent. He spends $500 on groceries. He uses his channel open with his employer because they are well connected and have channels open with other big hubs so he can pay his rent and his groceries. He also doesn't want to pay on chain fees to close the existing channel and open a new one. Bob has $500 left in his channel with his employer and wants to save it. He must now close the channel so he can move his BTC to a wallet he has the keys for. 

If Bob wants to ""withdraw"" $500 and park it in an on-chain Bitcoin address, then he can indeed close the channel with his employer. Or he can transfer funds to some other channel and then close that other channel if he wants to make things more obfuscated or has other reasons.

&gt; Next salary is coming.

This is an interesting part. LN is poorly suited for big one-time payments, so most likely Bob will not be receiving a $2000 payment each month on the Lightning Network anyway. Instead he will be paid daily or even hourly.

&gt;  How does Bob get paid? His channel is closed.

If the old channel is closed, then Bob is paid by opening and funding a new channel. Or am I missing something?

&gt; Also, Bob's employer noticed Bob is saving $500 a month and denies his next salary increase review.

Bob's employer can't possibly know if Bob is actually saving or if Bob just has to pay this money to somebody else outside of the Lightning Network (for example, Bob's landlord does not accept payments on the Lightning Network and wants on-chain transactions, traditional banking transfers or even cash). Yes, Bob's employer can try to make some random guesses and be a real dick, but this is not directly related to the use of the Lightning Network.

Moreover, if Bob has more than one channel (and that's how the Lightning Network is designed to work), then Bob's employer can't possibly know if it's Bob moving his money in the channel or Bob is just relaying transactions on behalf of somebody else.

I'm not sure if you are able to get better privacy with on-chain transactions, so the Lightning Network is at least not making the privacy situation worse.",1523300510

Who cares? The point is not that it should be successful every time. At 5% doublespend chance you get on average 5% discount on every purchase (attempting doublepend is free).

Then doing it again.

But that is mostly only in regards to situations that involve consequences to Bitcoin; if Bitcoin is not part of the feedback loop or only influenced weakly by the outcomes (and in some cases the perceptions and/or expectations of the participants may outweight the actual consequences), then the development of self-fueling issues is less restricted.",1523299373

In the moment I'm typing, the value of the BCH is 0.094 Bitcoins.

It means that more than 90% of Bitcoins owners are ""stupid"" and doesn't understand the real value of the BCH; or that 90% aren't that stupid and they attributed the intrinsic value of the BCH to be 1/10th of the Bitcoin.

In a world where fiat is near-free to some of these companies or something they already have a lot of (like Apple sitting on nearly 285 billion in fiat), wouldn't they be better positioned to buy cryptocurrencies (specifically, say Bitcoin) with some of their international fiat (say half), and then issue stock on a Bitcoin sidechain, then, as the price appreciates in comparison to fiat as more people want to buy their crypto-assets, sell that cryptocurrency at the same rate that they issue ownership while buying back ownership in fiat of their NYSE, NASDAQ, etc. stocks?

In that way, they are not realizing gains, or if they do realize gains, they are arguably offset by the ownership loss in the crypto side-chain.

This might be a way to (in a way) re-appropriate international cash without taking an immediate huge financial hit on it, plus delve into sidechains without putting in more commitment than their own stockholders are prepared for. I am not an accountant/lawyer, however, so this should not be construed as legit advice, just something to ponder.

"Now, as someone already pointed out, the key point in the original post seems to be incorrect. That is the claim that in the event of a liquidation the *exchange* ""gets the entire stack they (the trader) bet with"", i.e. that liquidation means the exchange gets all of the traders margin. This is the main point because if this were true, it would give the incentive for the exchange to manipulate the price in the described way.

But I don't think this is correct. When liquidation occurs, the margin doesn't go to the exchange, but is rather distributed to other market participants.

Let's look at this trough an example. Say you're short 1 BTC. Entry price is 6K. Leverage is 1:3. Your margin (stack) is 2.000 bucks, and you get liquidated if the BTC price hits $8.000. 

If BTC did go to 8K, it would break down like this: you borrowed 1 BTC; immediately sold that 1 BTC at 6K; bought back when the price hit 8K; and finally gave back the borrowed 1 BTC to the lender.

Your $2.000 margin didn't go to the exchange (they make money of fees the trader pays them to trade on margin), but was rather distributed to the other traders (buyers and sellers) in the market. It's a **buy high - sell low situation** (only the selling comes before buying, which is made possible through borrowing). ",1523298733
I'm talking about bitcoin ,1523298654
"Yes.  **The point is that they take BTC from you and pay out fiat on your behalf**.   That makes them payment processors, regardless of whether they are organization or not.  And it makes no difference they did not hand the fiat directly to you; all that means is that they are carrying out two functions: (a) exchanging BTC for fiat, and (b) messenger or gopher to pay your bills.  The merchants you seem to detest only want the functions of (a), and unfortunately for them, they are not in a position to use your friends for either (a) or (b).   

So, the delusion is that you are proof that it is possible to live on just BTC and intermediaries are unnecessary and detestable.   Come back when you can use BTC for goods and services without having to use your friends to maintain the delusion.",1523298625

- perks: with my credit card I get 90 days price protection (already got back $1,000 so far this year due to this), 90 days loss &amp; accident protection, 1 extra year of warranty (used this perk twice so far), travel protection insurance, car rental insurance, lost baggage reimbursement, 1.5%-5% cashback etc

If a merchant accepts BCH that’s great, because of 1). If that same merchant accepts Litecoin that’s terrible, because of 1) that now also goes for Litecoin + 2) because in public view, BCH is not the only global p2p electronic cash system. Say that merchant grows because of your usage of it, now that merchant introduces more people to crypto, but not only BCH, also Litecoin which is also being promoted by coreons as an alternative for day to day payments. From an outside perspective, this puts BCH in competition with all kinds of coins except BTC, which isn’t a cash system and isn’t promoted as such.

"&gt; It does because of the pools' algorithms that switch based on profitability. BTC price versus BCH price is considered, as well as the hashrate between the two chains.

You have it backwards though.  The DAA has zero knowledge of what the mining pools are doing.  It adjusted based on frequency of blocks mined, that's it.  If blocks are getting mined too quickly it becomes more difficult, if blocks are not getting mined fast enough, it becomes less difficult.  The target is roughly a block mined every 10 minutes and it uses the last 144 blocks mined to calculate the average mining time.  

If mining pools switch their hashpower from one chain to another based on profitability this is external to the BCH DAA.  If enough of them move one way or the other enough to affect the average block mining time, then the DAA will make an appropriate adjustment.  The DAA does NOT track profitability in any way shape or form.

"Users will pay for many services which will end up being a channel in the backend. Don’t believe me?
Well you pay monthly for Netflix right? Well, what if instead of a monthly subscription, you instead paid a micro transaction for every second of media you watch? Instead of $9.99 a month, you would pay only for the seconds you actually watch and truly be paying only for the content you watch. Then, once your $9.99 has been used up, you deposit another $10 to Netflix(a.k.a a channel).
This logic can also be applied to Instagram(pay a micro transaction for every “heart” you give to a picture and you then receive a micro transaction for every picture someone else “hearts”. You would have an incentive to deposit money here and there to try and receive “hearts”(a.k.a satoshis).
So, we can establish the very real possibility of channels being opened everywhere in the mainstream.
Now, you say I need a lightning node to transact with. Currently, yes you would be correct. However, if I trust Netflix for my service, why can I not trust them with monitoring my balance in the specific channel we have together? Surely if their nodes go down consistently and my balance is never correct, I’ll move to Hulu who has a better record of keeping track of their users balances.  Thus, businesses will have an incentive to run lightning nodes and lightning watchtowers.
Then, using the same wallet, which has opened countless channels or “subscriptions”, I will be able to pay others through lightning as those same users opened other channels with services they are using. 
There will also be many lightening nodes eventually. Don’t believe me? Go look at the current lightning node count and compare it to just three months ago. There’s also an incentive to run a lightning node as doing so provides a small revenue of micro income. It’s also cheaper to run a lightning node compared to a mining node.

&gt; and as soon as fees were at a more ""reasonable fee"" level of 40% of the average transaction, people dumped all their BTC into altcoins

I think you are drawing conclusions without any evidence. And what the hell does that have to do with DAA anyways?

&gt; Is that why we had the majority hashrate every other day

Yes, it was severely broken, and there was no way that bcash could sustain that amount of coin generation. Had you kept the bitcoin difficulty adjustment algorithm bcash had been dead before it even got its first block. If you implemented it now it would be dead as soon as bitcoin becomes just a little more profitable to mine than bcash (this doesnt work the other way around as if bcash is more profitable it get ~ 10 times the hashrate and generated 60 blocks pr hour again for a short period). Thats why your DAA is lifesupport to your coin. It would simply die if it had the bitcoin difficulty adjustment.

&gt; It's the only proven scaling solution, and is hands down the most secure.

Its not been proven.

&gt; egwit wasn't a consensus fork. It had 10% miner support until the new york agreement was proposed

and yet miners activated it

&gt; AXA/bilderberg-backed development team. 

don't forget your tinfoil hat

&gt; It still has zero support

You are delusional if you don't think the bitcoin community is stoked about segwit being activated.",1523295703
"Let's say the price is now $9k BCH and $1k BTC. It would eventually settle at about 90% mining BCH and 10% mining BTC. That's what the DAA does. It adjusts the difficulty based on the amount of hashpower that is on it at every block. Because pools use profitability to calculate which chain to mine, hashpower will pretty quickly move to about the same ratio as the price.",1523295696
"So for me it was either A. Go to a good 4 year in a prime location on the west coast with a good business school B. Go to small liberal arts D-3 school in the middle of nowhere or C. Grind away at scout tryouts and try to get drafted super late (there are a TON of rounds in MLB vs. other sports). A seemed like the clear winner to me. Plus I had almost all but burnt out on baseball. When something takes over your life like that, you have to REALLY want it, be obsessed with it to succeed. The majority of people (even those who are amazingly gifted), do not have that level of drive.

So I went to the 4 year. Learned alot, met amazing people, fell in love with the creative arts, graduated business school, worked Big 4 accounting and hated it, quit and moved to LA. I also got into crypto early and have been able to live off of it for the time being while starting some projects of my own.

In regards to your buddy, it really just comes down to his appetite for risk. I personally have an insane appetite, so going for it has really been THE thing for me. Then at least I can't say I didn't try. 

But from my understanding of pro football it's pretty different. I have some good family friends that have been in both leagues actually, and while they both reached ""The Show"" or the highest level of competition and I guess the highest pay, they both haven't been able to live off of their pro income. One guy was a pitcher in the MLB who played for a long time and for a lot of different teams at the pro level, and while he's successful has that corporate job now. The NFL player ended up breaking his shoulder blade on a play and never fully recovering. 

If I was your friend, I would have felt fine taking that corporate job. The ""beauty"" of a corporate job is that you eliminate so many of the variables that influence the success of players in sports. You have a job, you do it, you do it well, you clock out at a certain time go home see your kids. Don't have to worry about chronic lingering health issues. It's a much safer, simpler life. There's no fame in it. No glory. But that stuff fades pretty quickly.

I think your buddy made the right call, and you can tell him some internet stranger told him that. ",1523295695

"Btc has intrinisc value, and if you don't understand it, you shouldn't be buying. 

1. Bitcoin clears in 10-15 minutes. If you try to send money via a bank, it takes days to clear, and you don't know where it is while it floats in clearing limbo. Also, the banks take fees. Large fees. Bitcoin takes tiny fees. 

2. The dollar has no value. Its just a piece of paper, and the government is always printing more in a never ending cascade. Its becoming worth less and less every day. 

3. bitcoin is a currency despite the fact that the irs classed it as a commodity. Ether might be a commodity because its used to fuel gas transactions for smart contracts, but bitcoin is a currency. The only thing it doesn't have is state backing, but states are backed by their populations, and bitcoin has over 20 million wallets. https://www.statista.com/statistics/647374/worldwide-blockchain-wallet-users/ even assuming that some people have more than 1 wallet, that's still alot of users! That's more than the population of romania or the netherlands. We don't need the government, we are the people! We are bitcoin! Hoo haa!

4. The average cost of producing 1 bitcoin by mining is around 7,000 usd of electricity. 

5. You want to buy bitcoin as a consumer and immediately use it instead of credit cards because identity theft and credit card theft is a thing. You want to buy it as an investor and hold it because its value fluctuates, and you can make lots of money by playing the market. 

6. You want to accept bitcoin as a merchant because it protects you against scammers on ebay who order goods, post a fake address and chargeback, or who say merch was damaged, chargeback, and return an empty box. 

7. I profit by shopping with it. 

8. Bitcoin isn't a greater fool argument. It is a currency, and people who play the daily swings are traders. Before the big blowout hype of 2017, it was a stable and slow growing currency and was used for exchanging value. Hopefully we can go back to those days. 

9. Great utility makes me pay 50 cents to turn 10 dollars into quarters for a washing machine on laundry day. Stop lying about ""utility doesn't add value hurr durr.""

10. Bitcoin should be accepted by banks and used in place of dollars because they are more transparent than dollars, and illicit btc can be tainted properly in a fifo manner to track illicit btc, and to lock it out of the system. No more funding of drug lords via laundering once everything is electronic. 

This is a proposal to extend the power of bitcoin by adding a voting protocol to it. This is not about the existing power of bitcoin, which is pretty fucking amazing. the fact that btc is worth 7,000 dollars today goes to show its absolute domination. No other world currency can match btc in both absolute price (7k) and minimum unit (1 sat is less than a hundredth of a penny.) 

You are spreading irrational fear, lies, and misinformation when you claim btc doesn't have intrinsic value. You are attacking my idea because you want the price of btc to go down, simply because you want to buy some, or your envious that a friend bought some and you didn't, or your just cynical.

It's very slow, probably 50 times slower than I was before. But I still love programming and it gives me goals. Currently I'm working on something Mike Hearn suggested, using the security features of modern processors, designed to support ""Trusted Computing"", to harden Bitcoin wallets. It's almost ready to release. I just have to do the documentation.

And of course the price gyrations of bitcoins are entertaining to me. I have skin in the game. But I came by my bitcoins through luck, with little credit to me. I lived through the crash of 2011. So I've seen it before. Easy come, easy go.

That's my story. I'm pretty lucky overall. Even with the ALS, my life is very satisfying. But my life expectancy is limited.

"Hey there, thanks for stepping up for design, its always great to see. I'm the product design lead at a company called uPort (Decentralized Identity on Ethereum) which is a part of ConsenSys. Before uPort I worked on IBMs Hyperledger, and before that I wrote my thesis on Blockchain and Design. I've been thinking about this a lot over the years (actually, everday). I agree with your general point. Blockchain/crypto needs designers. However, I think there are a couple caveats here.

Blockchains, imo, are still in beta. Maybe not bitcoin, but Ethereum for sure. For that reason, I at least understand why UX design is not at the forefront of many teams minds. Also, I bristle a little bit when I see dApps being marketed as production level products on what is still a beta platform. I am happy there are at least some designers here working on things this early in the ecosystem.

Scalability is tightly bound to UX.  This was evident with CryptoKitties (there is some misconception here but that is a different topic). High transaction fees or slow blocktimes make things unusable. Devs need to solve this. 

Dealing with private keys is bullshit, but having private keys is necessary. In the case of Coinbase, you don't own your private keys. This might be great for UX and it may seem like a perfectly fine tradeoff for many of us in the western world, however this is untenable for people who can benefit most from blockchain: those in underdeveloped economies or living under oppression. At uPort, we currently use a biometric for ordinary transactions and use the seed phrase for account recovery. Storage of your seed phrase is another problem which we are trying to address with something we are calling Social Recovery which makes storage of the seed phrase feel more like a Social feature rather than a Security feature.

To your point about about Jobs. As a designer, I have mixed feelings on Jobs. He had great insights, however he probably isn't the greatest model for designers. Jobs/Apple, at least in those days tended to assume a lot of things about what users wanted rather than reason from first principles. Also, in general, the comparison is a little different. When Jobs made his mark, computers worked as intended for the most part. The computing market was much more mature than the blockchain market currently is.

Finally, a couple links. This is a funny/interesting article I bring up in my talks about design and blockchain (I've been focusing on Key Management as of late) and I think it echoes your sentiments.

Just use a standard DB.,1523294514
"It is important, but like everyone else here is saying, its a security complacency lawsuit, against nano and the exchange, in which the exchange is all ready dead, and the worst case scenario is Nano gets fined / some sort of other reprimand. It has little to do with crypto as a whole, and ultimately will just be a piece of history for future cases to look back on. Complacency isn't a new point of contention in/out of this space , and wont impact classification decisions. ",1523294503

"No they don't, that's the entire point of crypto. Banks control the transactions, and storage of fiat money. Two services that require bureaucracy. A system where people control the money doesn't mean a system without FIAT. All the tasks banks perform for you could theoretically be automated and performed securily on the blockchain. This is the utility of cryptocurrencies, not replacing FIAT currency.",1523294419

If it was useful the way it's designed right now, I'd be developing *for* it, not raising questions *against* it. I re-iterate: I want to be wrong about this. I want it to work and I want new financial tools that I can program myself and trust on that basis. The problem is, *it doesn't actually work well enough for production* due to some serious design issues. Lightning raises more questions than solutions on the issue of trust, and trustless financial activity is *precisely* why I got into crypto at all.",1523294372

"Stop it. It does not objectively have value. It has subjective value that must be determined by going to market. All commodities do. At market it will have an exchange value that is greater than its average cost in labor time (for production) defined by its utility proposition. If the utility proposition to an individual is not worth a premium then the commodity will eventually be not worth much more than its average cost of production. What is the average cost of production of a bitcoin? What utility value does it give you? Can you profit by using it (shopping with it) in such a way that paying any premium is justified? The answer to that is likely that there is no way to benefit from a Bitcoin that justifies paying lot for one that is not a speculative proposition made to a speculator. The bigger fool argument doesn't work that well as a value proposition. 

Government backed money has great utility. It will meet your government obligations. It's worth noting that not even great utility makes us pay $20 for a 10$ bill. It's quite plentiful and it can be sourced by simple bookkeeping. You might want to explain to people why a version of a trading token with fluctuating face value is something we ought to buy.

"Different scholars have different opinions about this but below are three arguments (from my google search) that different people make. Personally I think that certain cryptocurrencies (not gold backed tokens) are actually better than the bank notes (in Islamic point of view) and so does this answer: https://islam.stackexchange.com/questions/15010/is-trading-bitcoins-altcoins-halal-or-haram-sunni-view/

The main arguments are about (1) trading physical/tangible items, (2) wealth/money creation out of nothing, and (3) no real value.

Trade is supposed to be on physical items, you can't sell something you dont have, and you have to give possession to the other person after trade. This is the reason that things like futures trading is not allowed. Some people apply the same rule to crypto but if you understand what crypto is, you will realize that unlike banks we actually have real possession of our cryptocurrency and transactions include real transfers. 

Another argument is wealth/money creation out of nothing and that crypto has no real value.  An example of wealth creation out of nothing would be if you trade gold or silver and give ""receipts"" instead of hand to hand transfer of the asset it can cause problems. You can double or triple sell the same gold to different people, people can trade those ""receipts"" and wealth is created out of ""nothing"". Think modern banks, and what will happen if everyone tries to withdraw their money. According to scholars, modern banks are okay because people are ""forced"" to use government issued money and there is no other feasible alternative.  Personally I think that if you follow this reasoning a gold backed token is worse off than bitcoin for the same reasons people dont trust USDT.

Lastly people say that cryptos have no real value and if authorities were to ban them then the price would just fall to zero since there is no underlying intrinsic value. One could counter argue that crypto like bitcoin actually has real value if you consider Proof of Work and the mining difficulty. And this value is actually more ""real"" if you compare it with bank notes.",1523292564

"Note: I'm not a LN fan, but it doesn't do us any good when we don't stick to the facts.

&gt; It makes no economic sense to lock up your own money with a poorly connected node, just in case you need to receive money from them. 

In LN, you don't lock up any money with someone who opens a channel with you.  They provide 100% of the funds and it will remain this way until a payment routes through you to them (or through them to elsewhere).

As a new lightning node, they can't be paid without resorting to an onchain transaction(new channel opening), period.

&gt; Alice sends money to Bob, it goes through Amazon and Amazon is privvy to the entire transaction and you are doxxed to them.

This is not correct.  The payments through Amazon (in your example) are onion-wrapped.  Amazon can see where it goes, but they cannot know whether Alice is the source or whether Bob is the destination.  They could make an educated guess about it, but cannot know for sure.

&gt; Alice wants to send money to Bob. Bob doesn't have any channel open. Alice can't send funds to Bob.

This is also true if Bob just opened new channels on the network.  He can't be paid period until someone opens a channel with him, as channels are (typically) 100% funded by the open-er.

The open-er also pays 100% of the fees, no matter when the channel is closed.

&gt; Alice wants to send $100 worth of Bitcoin to Bob. They are both connected to Amazon with a channel. Bob opened a channel with $100 but Bob just bought a new toothbrush. Alice cannot send $100 to Bob.

In this case, Alice could send Bob back the price of a toothbrush, otherwise the situation is the same as above.

&gt; or there is some other thing called a watchtower that she has to trust with her money.

Watchtowers don't have access to your money.  You have to trust them to broadcast for you if you get attacked, but they don't get trusted with your money directly.

&gt; Bob makes $2000 a month. Bob is lucky. He's richer than 90% of other people on the planet. His employer pays his salary in Bitcoin using LN. 

LN is likely not going to be able to route payments of this size, especially not reliably.

&gt; Bob has $500 left in his channel with his employer and wants to save it. He must now close the channel so he can move his BTC to a wallet he has the keys for. Next salary is coming. 

Bob already has the keys for his LN channel.  Regardless, that detail isn't important - Bob can't both save money and be paid the next month's salary through the same channel.  A new channel would have to be opened.",1523292543

There was a whole fiasco back in October/November and one of the biggest conpsiracy theories was that USDT is being printed out of thin air, which has yet to be disproved since the Tether company won't allow anyone to perform a public audit of their books.

You can also see extremely suspicious activity going on in Bitfinex in the USDT/BTC pairs.

* [Bitfinexed](https://twitter.com/bitfinexed) - this anonymous person has compiled the majority of the info on the suspicion with Tether/Bitfinex, and is the main reason why I've avoided Tether since I heard about it.

"For most people, crypto just hasn’t proven itself. 

For me, as a deeply anti establishment millennial with a minimalist mindset who likes tech and sees the trends of decentralization arising from the failures of centralized society, crypto proved itself when it crossed 10k. You don’t make a 800b market for no reason and a market with no future certainly doesn’t hit 800b. Others who are less tech inclined but who need a solution to the chaos of the old world might have a higher tipping point, or just need to see 20k again and realize if they held it would have been fine. 

Also millennials are easily one of the poorest modern generations, the most tech savvy, and the weirdest. They try new things because they see the old way is broken, inefficient, and unsustainable. I think millennials once they get the story straight will go balls deep in crypto. Other, wealthier, generations will follow. ",1523291025

"&gt; There are a lot of applications where Lightning can be used and where it is the best option and where it is more convenient.

"What is being described here is common in other markets. I realize most of the people reading this are retail, but what is labeled as ""manipulation"" is truly par for the course on exchange-based markets and elsewhere (such as FX). I'm writing this because its a pet peeve of mine hearing retail traders complain about the ""big boys"" when in fact all they are is uninformed and require more reading and research.

First off, Bitfinex has proven itself as shady beyond belief. Nonstop. I would rather cut a large position into 1,000 pieces vs. have to use them. At some point I think their platform will bomb out, but that's pure speculation. Just so you know I am definitely not on their side.

Short interest strategies are popular in equities, and have been for years. The images posted above are literally a checklist of common short interest trading strategies. 

Many people use reactive strategies / bots. Large position &gt; price upticks &gt; buy. Threshold after threshold gets hit and price moves quite rapidly in a unidirectional manner. Profits collected, price declines. 

The above poster is assuming that the exchanges are responsible for the activity. Bottom line is that there is no way to know this without actually sitting in their offices, or wherever else such activity might take place. 

In an unregulated market, wild west rules apply. I could write a script right now that mimics the above and nobody would know who did it, aside from the exchange. Exchanges tend not to have rules on trade size or how they're executed (as in iceberg orders on a regular exchange) where the activity is far more spread out. It could also be a larger trader (who also happens to be unsophisticated from a trading standpoint) taking action. 

The bottom line is we have no idea. Whenever I deal with newer traders (I've been trading traditional markets for 17 years) I tell them just to worry about what's happening and navigate around it. At the end of the day, your strategy and wallet could care less about who is doing what, where and why. It is a waste of energy and effort. The only one you end up hurting is yourself - there is nothing to gain by doing this.

The above actions can be exploited and strategies built around them. Here are a couple links to get the ball rolling:

https://quantpedia.com/Screener/Details/46
https://www.schaeffersresearch.com/education/expectational-analysis/sentiment-analysis/short-interest

For other items above, well, prices are attracted to liquidity. This is volumes 101. When I see these articles written by the crypto community about order book ""walls"" I want to slap my head because these ""walls"" are in fact best described as magnets. 

Just a couple examples. As I say: pet peeve. The OP, while attempting to be virtuous, appears uninformed himself.

"&gt;you're transacting directly to a Visa machine with the Visa card.

A visa credit card doesnt need to settle with your bank instantly. But I said debit card. A debit card does and can. Just put €100 in your account, go anywhere in the world, withdraw €100, notice how it works, instantly. Try again a few seconds later, and it will tell you insufficient balance. Also on holidays. Computers really do work 24/7 and a fiat transactions dont really take more than a few (milliseconds) - especially not if its the banks advantage.  

Nothing is easier than achieving sub second latency when it comes to databases, and the cost of adding a record to a central database, isnt even worth counting.  Maintaining a P2P, decentralised, trustless, immutable transaction record, now THAT is difficult. And relatively expensive if you need (10s of) thousands of copies that each need to be validated.

Mining RBF transactions does not hurt the coin and if it does it's doomed since it's very hard to stop.

Miners aren't your friends, miners are specifically not meant to have a political interest in the coin. 

Miners with political goals are the fucking worst thing that can happen to a coin since politics is a centralizing force. Miners are the issuers of coinage, if they also have the political power you are in fact having a central bank. And if you think satoshi would have liked that you are deluded.

Don't like the use of the bitcoin blockchain to record colored coins.   Given the past bottleneck/fee history &amp; developer centralization, this introduces systemic risk. The Lykke whitepaper talks this risk by saying 'To mitigate capacity limit, 'Lightning Network and Micropayment channels are the perspective approaches' and  'Bitcoin may be the TCP/IP of money'.

Because there are real problems with Segwit, and there were massive problems with not allowing the chain to scale.

Right, and you're the result of it.

&gt; ""r"" is inside the word ""tree""

Unless you're speaking German, and then it is not inside the word Baum. A soft fork was implemented where both German and English were considered valid, therefore it is correct to say from the German perspective that there is no letter r in Baum. You may well argue that this is stupid, I would even be sympathetic to that perspective, but it is a natural consequence of soft forks that this is the way it is. Your inability to deal with it doesn't make a difference to the fact.

&gt; 0.12 core does not see blocks bigger than 1MB either what happens is that a 0.16 node before sending ""tree"" to a 0.12 one cuts out the ""r"" and just sends ""tee"" so that the 0.12 node can see the block.

And you clearly know this very well, because you just admitted as much. Therefore, from the perspective of a 0.12 node, the signatures are not in the fucking block, deal with it. It's an anyone can spend transaction from their perspective.

"Third world adoption is happening. A wallet on a $20 android phone is all a person needs. There are mud huts and remote villages with solar power and they have super basic android and Nokia phones. Bitcoin wallets work on those. They have internet access.... but the closest western union or money lending service is in the city which is miles away. So... yes it’s very relevant. 

https://qz.com/1021155/bitcoin-is-being-taken-up-in-zimbabwe-nigeria-south-africa-and-venezuela-among-developing-countries/

I sent BTC to a friend in South America. Closest western union was a 3 hour bus ride. But he knew someone nearby who had access to an exchange in his town. Sent BTC, done. How is that not relevant?

Since it’s still in the early phase, of course some traditional banking infrastructure is needed. But as more people transact goods and services for it, the expectations is to just trade with it and price goods with crypto. With more adoption, the price will become less volatile. 

Western union continues to have the advantage of operating in a fiat cash world. So of course they’re doing ok. 

Now why use gift/visa prepaid cards? Sure it’s an option but why physically leave my house for something I can do from my couch or bed? U do understand how Netflix and renting movies online beat out Blockbusters and video rentals around the corner block, right? Any tech that makes it easier to do from home eventually wins out. 

The only data that can be extracted from the blockchain is the data I choose to share on it. The most useful info for ID theft is my ss, dob, and license. I never put that on the blockchain. I never share that with a merchant. So isn’t ID thieves jobs now that much harder to get my info that was never out there to begin with?

So... I can buy stuff online from the comfort of home, never giving out my sensitive info, and therefore I have no need for gift cards.

And that's not all.  Here's the real kicker.  Even ""devs"" for Bitcoin Core do the same thing.  Believe me.  Even the Maxwells and Mows and their buddies like Charlie etc actually come to this sub to imitate us and follow what this community is doing.  It's hysterical.

But it's also a very powerful sign to any observer with intuition that Bitcoin Cash is on the right track.  (Of course, we already knew that.)

So which one of you will walk through that door next?  Will it be Greg again?  Adam this time?  Is Fluffypony joining in?  (We've seen Fluffy do this in his videos.)

"""Almost"" exactly, yeah, it's just that the title has a point to make, and the part that you used is exactly the part that's *not* the point.

&gt; But for blockchain itself the trust is created by the fact that data cannot be mutated and is transparant which forces people and companies to be honest right?

This is true in the trivial sense, yeah. I guess the thing I want to explain why I don't feel that excited by it, which is that... we've been able to do that for decades. Before cryptocurrency, if you'd gone on about how great your cryptographically secured whatever is, only nerds would have even paid attention to you, and the response from even those nerds would in most cases have been ""what's the point?"".

BitCoin *does* solve a problem that had no solution before. But it solves that problem because its details fit together in a certain way. All you need to believe is that you'll find *one* sorry bastard somewhere in the world who'll take BTC in exchange for something, and poof, all of a sudden there's an incentive to mine now, and to keep mining later, and to accept other miners' blocks, and to avoid letting one mining pool get too much power, and to maybe buy BTC from others. And to do all that, all the system needs to keep track of is its own state. Compare that to, say, the [original conception of Ripple](http://library.uniteddiversity.coop/Money_and_Economics/decentralizedcurrency.pdf) - it'd work great if you just had everyone on board from the start, it's just that it would need to be bootstrapped by people who don't really gain anything from being able to just transact with each other at first. It's not a matter of technical quality, it's that somehow in the space of all possible designs of what kind of incentives a design could have, BitCoin discovered a spot where almost by accident everything just lined up.

That impresses me. It really does. It would excite me if the tradeoffs weren't so huge. But blockchain projects in general don't even impress me. At best, as I understand it, what they are doing is stuff that in fact is useful, but that would have been unexciting to even the nerds in 2008, and is only new getting funding thanks to hype. I wish I could actually *name* one project like that, though. Mostly everything that I see seems to just vaguely assume that because all the incentives to use the network ""right"" lined up with BitCoin, they must line up right with any blockchain system. That's hard enough with a currency ledger, and with things like voting records or supply chain tracking, you've got even more details about incentives that you *actually* have to get right, because if you don't, your system is useless.

"I think it is important to remember that LN is not important for just BTC, several other altcoins are also following that roadmap with SegWit (LTC, VTC, etc) too.

SegWit and LN have been an engineered power grab across several currencies, as any using that technology is basically beholden to Blockstream, Lightning Labs, and Chaincode developers.

I believe this is why we've seen attacks on Bitcoin Cash increasing lately, which seems to be rooted at the moment in anti-ASIC/Bitmain rhetoric and outright libel on other subs like /cryptocurrency, and now this madness with Twitter. All bets are on Lightning now for many coins as their scaling plan, and BCH is out there proving that the on-chain roadmap was right all along, which could spark further insurrections against the Blockstream plan much like Cash did.

"The problem was that Bitmain was the only entity with the real ASICs. They only decided to start selling them to the public when the PoW change was announced. I really like Bitcoin, and it's one of my top 3 holdings, but it is vulnerable to 51% attacks: https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-bogeyman-cometh-segwit2x-51-attack/ - having ASICs for sale to the general public has certainly helped reduce that threat, and I'm all for that. If Monero ASICs had been available to everyone, I don't think the Monero community would have had a problem with this situation, and the fork wouldn't have happened. It happened because one entity took control of something that was supposed to be for everyone, while simultaneously posing a rather large threat to the security

It wasn't the whim of one developer either, a large majority of the Monero community supports this fork and has been asking for it since it was discovered that Bitmain controlled so much of the hashing power

I do think this has made Monero more decentralized, not less. The mining has now become much more decentralized because one company isn't holding more than half of the network hashing power

Also, the Monero devs are prepared to tweak the PoW again if need be. More ASICs can be built, but it takes time, and nobody wants to invest in building ASICs to try to hit a moving target",1523287777

"If you'd read it, you would have hopefully have noticed that I said Bitcoin can't really be considered a store of value due to its age. But I then went on to look at it based on the qualities of known stores of value.

Simplifying definitions down to the point where they're no longer useful is not a solution to over-complication.

The definition you provided, while common, is notoriously vague. It passes the buck to 'predictably useful' -- what assets qualify as that? The very idea of predictability in a scarce asset's value, affects the price, in a recursive fashion. Using your definition, you could come to the conclusion that true stores of value don't exist, or that only depreciating ones (i.e. the predictable ones) do.

This is why I avoided actually delving into a definition and just considered the purpose: risk management of wealth.

&gt;People do the same thing with gold. It used to be a good store of value before rampant speculation took over the market, now its not.

So is it a bad store of value, or not a store of value at all anymore?",1523286615
"Depends how often each person opens a channel. My understanding is you'd put, say, $100 into a well-connected channel and only top it up infrequently. A bit like how many people operate their PayPal account.

BTC capacity is around [300,000 transactions per day](https://blockchain.info/charts) (not all currently used) and growing as segwit and batching gain traction - growing to, what, 500,000?

So let's say, very ballpark, there could be capacity for 200,000 more transactions a day than are currently going through. That would allow around 6 million people a month to open a LN channel.

Very ballpark number of course, but it does suggest significant LN adoption is quite possible before space on the blockchain becomes a limiting factor.",1523286606

"No you don't get my point. 

It makes no sense to say ""the number of blocks that end up on chain"" it doesn't change a thing other than making it unprofitably for SM if the new level of difficulty were permanent. What matters is that

In difficulty D SM has 38% of hashpower, and claim s 38% of the 6 blocks published on chain every hour. 

In difficulty D' SM has 38% of hashpower, and claims 43% of the 6 blocks that are published on chain every hour. 

This is the whole poin. SM doesn't care that actually 10 blocks are mined every hour in D' and only 6 make it on chain because because if he switches to following the protocol t claim those blocks then the system goes back to D and he goes back to claiming 38% of the 6 blocks  published every hour.

"You have to understand why this is though--it's because blockchains absolutely need to prioritize security waaaay above everything else, including UI. This is why private keys and some systems are as complicated as they are. And with out this security Bitcoin would have never have gotten to 20k, because it would have been hacked long before that.

Far too often in the history of software development security has been an after thought to customer facing features and general user experience. Satoshi was a visionary in part because he flipped this on his head and said fuck the user experience, we need to make this decentralized and secure first. Say what you will about bitcoin and it's flaws, if nothing else the core blockchain itself has proven to be extremely secure over the years--it's only the centralized exchanges that have been hacked. While I agree that modern blockchains need better user facing features, we still need security to be number 1. Besides, if we had good UI we still don't have a solution for scaling on truly decentralized infrastructure yet. No point in having a good UI to attract users if the systems can't even handle them anyway.",1523286240

Technically, you should be out now since overall market cap is far more indicative than Bitcoin’s price. The $5.9K price is completely arbitrary. Bitcoin’s next bottom could be $4.2K or $6.3K. For you, if Bitcoin bottoms at $5.9K again (which it won’t) and then springs back up to $40K, you’ve lost big.

"I am envious of your hope in change, and the role crypto can play to help but I think the problem (and I hate to say it) is far more sinister than 'banks' , 'corporations' and 'governments'. We (me included) personify these entities to help target our anger, hate, frustration etc but they are each man-made systems designed (initially) to allow order and peace among a vast number of players. Maybe more players than our biology has had time to become accustomed to. As our population has exploded and become more integrated across the globe, these delicate systems have become infinitely complex and stakeholders have lost all sense of accountability because there is now a convoluted and tortuous link between action and reaction. In fact, inhumane acts are explained away as necessary evils to maintain some level of balance. Short term gains are rewarded extortionately and vastly disproportionately to penalties of long term neglect. Tackling these systems, and please convince me otherwise, have almost reached a point of no return. Their enormity and investment denies any chance of true change. The possibility of a significant proportion of international governments, big business and banks reaching some harmonious consensus on a future direction, which doesn't compromise their immediate or future positions, and is in the interest of both the globe and the common man, is laughably horrifying. Sorry for the sinister perspective, it is a Monday after all. ",1523285260
"&gt; If you drastically lower difficulty then honest mining becomes drastically more profitable

Yes, intuition indicates this, but the selfish mining attack nerfs this effect by forcing the honest miners to orphan a greater percentage of their blocks than the selfish miner. It's only a nerf, though; honest miners that stupidly stick with it will see slightly decreased revenues, and honest miners that respond to the attack by ceasing mining activity yield more hashpower to the selfish miner, causing him to approach the 51% threshold and forcing him to either stop mining selfishly or risk being a central point of failure.

The model only works if you assume that 100% of honest miners will continue mining in the adverse condition of high orphanage for a long period of time. I find this highly unlikely, to say the least. As you say: Bitcoin is a lever.",1523285248

"I've also seen much from Maduro promoting and normalizing other cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, within VEN too... Laws passed, Exchanges encouraged, classes given, seminars, youth groups formed, etc... A major, major public education push designed to get the public aware and accepting cryptocurrencies.

I'm sure the moron thinks he's doing this to raise acceptance for the Petro, but the end result is unavoidable; the petro is quantifiably worse than the bolivar, as outrageous as that sounds, so no one will want to hold it. Meanwhile, they'll all be allowed to buy and hold bitcoin.

Venezuela is EXTREMELY well primed to become the first country to have its currencie(s) devoured by bitcoin. (Hyperbitcoinization) Polls have shown that the majority of the country now knows what cryptocurrencies are and a sizable percentage think positively of them already... More than anywhere else in the world except maybe japan.

My guess is that the Petro is a non-starter (for technical reasons, not just the lack of trust in Maduro) and the Bolivar's slide will accellerate this year, leaving Bitcoin as the best option for anyone who can't get their hands on Dollars there. (And the US embargo on exactly that is only getting stronger.)

So hopefully, within 1-2 years, especially as new,  lightning-enabled wallets proliferate and make cheap, reliable crypto transactions a reality for them, Bitcoin will take off like a rocket, replacing dollars and of course the bolivar in daily use, nationwide.

"It is a mistake to blindly trust capitalism; if left unchecked, there self-fueling mechanism that lead to degenerate states.

The genius of Satoshi was to design Bitcoin in such a way that it tames capitalism, channeling capitalism's own natural tendencies into steering itself away from undesirable states; it is in many important aspects way more self-correcting than unrestrained capitalism.

But that is mostly only in regards to situations that involve consequences to Bitcoin; if Bitcoin is not part of the feedback loop or only influenced weakly by the outcomes (and in some cases the perceptions and/or expectations of the participants may outweight the actual consequences), then the development of self-fueling issues is less restricted.",1523283538

"I would mind as this is not what the participants in either network agreed on originally and there is no consensus process in place for such decisions. So I'd say that the status quo in this case is preferable.

While the name of the currency is not part of the consensus rules of either network and as far as I know does not actually matter at all in terms of network/transactions, we find it convenient to name them as it makes it easier to discuss/sell/buy them. So the name is usually chosen designing the software used to enforce consensus rules, to facilitate development/discussion and give substance to the project, that name generally sticks when software gets released (unless it is agreed that it is strictly a ""project name"").

Then when users decide which software they want to run they will generally look at the documentation and in this case the most used implementations of the network consensus rules on both sides are pretty clear on what each currency should be called. Bitcoin ABC denominates the currency on *their* network ""Bitcoin Cash"" and Bitcoin Core documents *theirs* as ""Bitcoin"". So I usually go by that logically, the exception to this rule is if a project attempts to use the name chosen by a **pre-existing** project with public releases. Nothing prevents your from calling them differently, as previously stated it won't change how they work.

Just for the thought exercise, if right now someone hardforked Bitcoin ABC contentiously to create their own cryptocurrency and they chose to also call it ""Bitcoin Cash"", I would refuse to call their currency ""Bitcoin Cash"" and it would certainly make me not want to use their software. This is most likely one of the reasons why Bitcoin ABC originally decided to use a new name instead of reusing ""Bitcoin"".  And if they suddenly decided to change this decision, I feel like many of their users might change their mind about their software, but this last point is just my gut feelings.",1523283472

"I'd even say I'd rather have Bitmain exploit their delusion and eventually make people realize the ASIC resistance BS, than if a government exploits it. Then they can crush Monero by forcing Bitmain to build ASICs for them in secret and 51% attack Monero.

"The ongoing risk with LN remains the very complexity that is now built into the system.

It increases the risks of using the network because either some part of it ends up breaking or one of the major players in the network either departs unexpectedly (potentially killing a lot of channels at once) or becomes a bad actor. Currently the only incentive built into the LN protocol (as far as I know) is the penalty for attempting fraud.

The beautiful simplicity of Bitcoin has been a major strength as it allowed everyone to have a hand in network security, and the were, consequently, very few points of failure.

Rather than attempting a slow but steady approach scaling it really feels like they're counting on a all-or-nothing switch flip that has the *potential* to create a functioning, speedy network that everyone uses but also carries the potential downside of crippling BTC's ability to scale at all (i.e nobody trusts/uses LN and the onchain fees are exorbitant).

I am still rather mindblown that they turned down *any* true blocksize increase as offered over the years. ",1523283290
"Exactly. If someone wants more precise numbers, almost 60 million coins were hacked, while the total circulating supply is 14 854 million coins. So a total amount of 0.4% of all coins were stolen.

"In my opinion, no. While this is nice, it still doesn't solve some major issues which are in the way of widespread adoption, like proper storage and backup of seeds, or the need to be **very** precise when sending / receiving crypto.

Also, I think that this might create further issues such as users using the wrong apps that they downloaded from the store, thinking that the app's storage is secure while it is not the phones cold storage.

Security wise, I wouldn't trust anything to be secure if it's using the phone's display while it is booting Android (which it has to when you are sending payments over the internet, of course). They might use some elaborate hardware for that, but i highly doubt they will.

So all in all, especially when considering the price, I don't think it will impact the market at all. ",1523283079

No. BTC has RBF so 0-conf isn't secure anymore, and additionally, the fees would have been too high last December for example.

Such as bitcoin (1milion still owned by satoshi), Ethereum(initially offered as 100% ICO, which luckily could be mined) Every ERC20 token ever created !!!!, yes and plenty of those have been or are in the top20 coins, non of them have been called a scam, and most recently VERGE had a bug which had lots of similarly to the one Dash had ages ago !, making it even more credible that there was no ill attempt, and nobody suffered any damage what so ever from it.

(My take: That is more or less how I see most ""use blockchain to solve problem"" projects, yeah. But BitCoin itself impresses me - all the incentives really do line up right with it to make something that's at least good at convincing people it's valuable, if not that useful as an actual currency. I'll still take fiat over BitCoin mostly because of the high cost of securing the network, but at least that's not a totally one-sided tradeoff - I can see how I might change my mind if, say, I was convinced that central banks were really poor stewards of currencies.)",1523282835

Those servers/databases have every transaction and all the customer account info: information that customer gave them when they signed up for their credit and debit cards like social security, date of birth, license number, address

You keep bringing this up when we are talking about bitcoin vs cash/pre-paid in cash cards, not bitcoin vs cards you have to give your social security number for.

&gt; why should I have to physically leave my house to purchase a card with cash when I can just stay at home and use my BTC

because you say you're worried about data leaks more than convenience and the blockchain adds yet another vector to cross link data and expose your personal information like what and how much you have been buying and from who. blockchain data has already been used to compromise peoples identities and bring criminal prosecutions. you can't somehow become more secure by adding more data.

&gt;Furthermore, how is someone in a third world country supposed to buy these gift cards to make purchases?

How is someone in the third world without internet access supposed to use bitcoin? None of that is relevant to whether cash is more private than bitcoin.

Why do you think anyone is still using Western Union then? Western Union are doing better business now than when Bitcoin was first launched, which isn't what you would expect if, because you can't actually use bitcoin properly without access to traditional banking infrastructure.

"What qualifies as a store of value isn't well defined. I've commented on this before so I'm gonna plagiarise myself, but quite different assets can be stores of value, each having significant drawbacks. What qualifies as a store of value and what doesn't, is debatable -- both gold and money are not universally considered stores of value for various reasons (although for our purposes I'll ignore that). Realistically, any asset can be considered a store of value in the right circumstances, where there's demand. 


The purpose of any store of value is risk management of wealth based on a stable supply and demand of an the underlying asset.

As an asset, Bitcoin's scarcity is well-known, and locked at 21m coins. Demand is the main variable, and the driver of the price.

I would argue that Bitcoin's age is actually what makes it somewhat ineligible to be considered a store of value (i.e. if I was a financial adviser I wouldn't consider it for recommendation) -- there is not enough evidence to say that it will have reasonable purchasing power in 100 years, while an asset like gold has a much better track record. This means that it may be a great store of value, but we just can't say yet. However, we can analyse the fundamentals of what makes other assets stores of value and apply them to Bitcoin.

There are not too many qualities to consider in what makes a good a store of value. I'll go through five:

Scarcity: This is fundamental --without scarcity, an asset is effectively worthless as a store of value. E.g. You can't use fresh air as a store of value, because there's so much it's impractical to acquire enough to get to the point you'd be willing to pay for it (although there is intrinsic value in it, I'm sure you'd agree). Bitcoin's finite scarcity is 21,000,000. When fiat money undergoes hyperinflation, scarcity is what is being violated. Assets where it's difficult to define scarcity are often considered speculative assets.

One of the most desirable qualities is predictability in the future, which is what you're taking issue with, as predictability is a close analogue to volatility. Bitcoin's valuation exhibits a lot of volatility in the short term, but in the long term, as much as its short life has allowed, it has dramatically outperformed other stores of values -- it has accumulated value as well as storing. Its volatility has also decreased over time, a trend that suggests it will one day be rare to drop or gain massive amounts in a day. Without a long enough timeline, it's hard to comment on Bitcoin's long-term predictability, but its current valuation history is not a negative at all, and short term volatility is not really relevant (as a store of value -- which is long-term focused). Importantly, it hasn't shown much sign of depreciation, which is closely related. I also feel it's worth comparing gold's predictability via its value over time: http://www.macrotrends.net/1333/historical-gold-prices-100-year-chart .

Depreciation is an undesirable quality, but it doesn't preclude something from still being a store of value. All stores of value have a risk of depreciation. Fiat money is a good example of an almost certainly depreciating store of value. It decays a lot, but it does so predictably (a good quality), so it is still useful as a store of value in many situations. That said, you wouldn't want keep $100K in a bank account.

Ease of exchange is important, to a degree. You can't effectively store value if you are unable to transfer it to others in exchange for something else (realising your value). Fiat money is very easy (though not perfect), given that that is its purpose. Gold is bad in this respect -- so little exists, and as such, small amounts have lots of purchasing power and are impractical to divide. A gram of gold is worth over forty dollars, so it is not very useful for buying milk. One of Bitcoin's unique properties is that its scarcity is in line with go-to options such as gold and real estate, but that it's also easy to exchange and easily divisible.

Durability is another aspect. Gold is very non-reactive, and so is a great choice as a store of value. Bitcoin is virtual, abstract, and so considering its durability is a different proposition. In some respects it's completely impervious to the usual problems, e.g. real estate will crumble to dust over time if not maintained (though land has inherent value). However, there are existential threats. E.g. Attacks on the network, losing/forgetting key, unprecedented mathematical breakthroughs, solar flares destroying Earth's electrical grids, etc. -- these are all hard to quantify, and the latter two mentioned would be catastrophic to life in general in that they'd destroy fiat money systems too, but they should be considered.

Overall, in the five categories mentioned, I'd say that Bitcoin's fulfilment of the above qualities is: 

Scarcity: Excellent 

Predictability: Unproven (but probably poor ) 

Depreciation: Unproven (but probably good) 

Ease of exchange: Excellent 

Durability: Medium

Looking at gold's predictability (which is poor: http://www.macrotrends.net/1333/historical-gold-prices-100-year-chart), it suggests it's possible Bitcoin might never be predictable, but people don't consider gold a poor store of value. Great predictability but poor depreciation (e.g. cash) may be less desirable to some. Real estate appears to be going through large cyclical bubbles.

TL;DR: All stores of value are just wealth preservation vehicles that are chosen based on risk assessments. All of them have problems - gold, cash, bitcoin, real estate, cattle, etc.",1523281039

It's like the current spike in GE stock that's occurring because people think buffet is going to go in at 20%. Why the hell would he do that? The stock jumped based on this rumor because people think he will pump it up so now, if he was really buying GE, he would have to buy more expensive shares.

That's not a very good challenge as they are disincentivizing double spends by charging double what the product is worth!

Prez Trump and republicans were able to get a new tax structure through that is going to make filing taxes a lot easier and reduce the amount of taxes most people pay. A lot of deductions from income were removed however a single or married auto deduction was doubled. This makes the tax submission much easier for most tax filers. There is no need to 'itemize' since it will be less for most people then the basic deduction (12/24k). Hence if there are taxable gains on Bitcoin it would be good to file the gains under 2017 so you can itemize all the cost/expenses against the income to reduce the tax liability on the gains. ,1523280186

"There is no reason to change POW. Billions of dollars have been spent on SHA256 ASICs, and Core (which Luke is a part of) is starting the narrative that we need to change POW so that all that money invested in the SHA256 ASIC network is essentially made obsolete.

In my opinion, there are 2 possible reasons, 1) to destroy Bitcoin, or 2) to benefit manufacturers of different hardware.

This Core takeover looks like a CIA operation and I would not be surprised if everything that has happened with Core since 2014 is to destabilize and destroy bitcoin from within. BCH is the resistance to the Core takeover.

Interestingly, if they change the POW algorithm, all of those miners will move their hashpower to BCH, which would benefit BCH... but I think the purpose of doing so would be to make the world distrustful of bitcoin as a whole, and that would be bad for everyone in crypto. It could also just make BTC go down and bring BCH to the top, but that's a gamble I'm not sure is worth testing.",1523279936

Fair enough,

But know that small come at a price.

Higher transactions cost.

It is a matter of tradeoff, I consider it is critical for bitcoin to have cheap transactions so it can have as much use case as possible to help decentralisation and adoption.

The co-creator of TXhighway.com and I were able to onboard a local hacker bar in Tokyo during SVC. 

We saw that they used to accept Bitcoin but stopped after the fees got high (no surprise there). We then asked if they would take Bitcoin Cash. They said maybe. We then said well let me just tip you, we'll give you a dollar just to show you how it works. 

After a quick donation they saw how fast 0conf worked. It helped that we were in a hacker bar, and despite a language barrier we were able to walk them through why its better. Fast, almost free, secure, genesis block, it is Bitcoin. 

We then showed the hacker / bartender txhighway.com and did a test donation to ourselves, to show the animation upon payment. He loved the animation and while we were tipping other bar patrons in BCH and explaining Bitcoin we asked if we would give him an ad on this website would they accept Bitcoin Cash. 

They accepted, so I whipped out my laptop and pushed that update up in 5 min. And they were happy to accept. Which promptly lead us to a very boozy time. 


We used the Bitcoin.com wallet to show them as it shows immediate receipt of payment. The challenges were language barrier, and trust. Giving a tip before asking them to accept seemed to help. 

All in all it was a positive experience. Go see hackers.bar.

Why someone or a group want to crash BTC is another issue altogether. But I think the timing is a bit too suspicious.",1523278701
"LN nodes advertise connectivity through the topology distribution part of the routing algorithm.  If this does not reflect the actual availability of working paths then payments will fail to route.  This can possibly be fixed by providing more detail in the topology distribution, but doing so will add to the bandwidth, storage, and processing cost of the LN network.  A full solution required updating the global topology to all nodes on every change of every channel state, which can happen on every transaction, every node up/down event or every change in node policy regarding use of its capital by third parties.  This makes a large scale distributed solution to LN scaling unlikely.  More likely, the cost of routing in the LN will exceed the cost of mining node operation in the bitcoin network in topologies that aren't highly centralized.  It is the responsibility of those promoting the LN to quantify these trade offs.  For several years, u/jstolfi and others have asked for this analysis but it has not been forthcoming. ",1523278685

- High tiers: NEO, OMG
- Mid tiers: ICX, ONT
- Low tiers: Campus Coin, Gifto, Blockmason, Storm and etc.

- to dump my biggest investment in those imminent and safe, well known coins. Coins I think have a safe future (OMG and NEO). The safest bet is BTC and ETH of course, but I switched since the potential is too low. 

- To slowly, in small amounts each month or day or whatever, accumulate over time in those unsafe, relatively new, but wildly potential coins. Coins that can have a 500x growth. Campus Coin for instance; I'm from Norway, so 1 NOK = 14 Campus Coins. Easily 100k Campus Coins with small change everyday. ",1523278566

- develop next gen hashrate ASIC miners 
- build as many as possible, use internally only
- develop next next gen hashrate miner, sell old tech to market (likely triggered only when a competitor is making moves)
- build next next gen, use internally only
- and the cycle continues

Who cares? Anyone who wants an actual decentralised market. They only reason we don't see them perform 51% attacks is it's not worth it for them to raise red flags and give reason for ETH / BTC to shut them down.

"UX design for crypto apps is incredibly difficult. When making the portfolio app [BitUniverse](https://www.bituniverse.org) we've found that it's a very delicate balancing act between making something that's clean and understandable, and giving users all the information they need at one time.

For example, our landing page is the user's portfolio overview page. The idea of this page is to give users a top down overview of their entire portfolio, so we have statistics showing daily profit, total balance etc, and even a graph so that people can easily see at a glance how their coins have been performing over the past month. Below that we have some specifics of held coins, but we can only include a limited amount of data before the screen starts to look cluttered.

This is a difficult issue that a lot of apps in this space need to solve.

I agree with you that everyone - including the person controlling the @Bitcoin account - has a legitimate right to promote their own idea of what Bitcoin is. But not necessarily on Twitter. I think that what @Bitcoin was doing was potentially misguiding people. So I understand why Twitter is intervening. Can the suspension be seen as censorship? Yes, I think so. But so is banning the ""Hey I'm Vital1k, send me 0.5 ETH I'll send you back 2 ETH""-type scammers. You're not entitled to post whatever the hell you want on Twitter. You can tweet what they allow you to tweet. If you don't agree with their policies I guess there are alternatives.

"The current market seems to be largely driven not by organic buying and selling, but by exchange driven manipulation of the spot market to exploit the current dynamics that come from a lack of organic buying. We just saw it again now as they liquidated 4K longs but you [can see this over and over in the last week](https://i.imgur.com/LpgnksQ.png).

We have seen several forces set an incentive for exchanges to do this:

* Consistently declining volume - this leads to lower total fee revenue for exchanges, and an incentive to manipulate the price in order to earn revenue through liquidations rather than trading fees.

* Move towards more leveraged positions - both leveraged shorts and leveraged longs are [at or near record levels.](https://i.imgur.com/ljSohM5.png) Shorts especially have gone from 8K outstanding in January to 33K right now, a whole tripling in outstanding positions. 

* Move away from the spot market and towards derivatives - Anybody who has been checking [the combined orderbook](https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/books/USD) over the last few months has seen Bitmex completely take over the market, while GDAX, Bitfinex, Gemini and others see consistent declines. I've noticed myself an increased interest across the Internet on how derivatives work and anecdoteally have seen more people move away from the HODL meme and towards trading taking high margin bets with a portion of their stack.

Some exchanges like Gemini have reacted to all of this by increasing their trading fees by 400%. 

Meanwhile Bitfinex seems to be using its hefty weight to manipulate the price in order to capitalize on the record number of people using margin to bet.  Since the exchanges know the characteristics of the outstanding shorts/longs, they can essentially engineer movements in price that create income in terms of liquidations. When there are lots of overleveraged shorts, an exchange can pump the price with bots briefly and collect the short position stacks after it liquidates them. Same with longs but in reverse, a quick burst of selling pressure. 

You can see this in the most recent pumps, where 1K buy orders appear out of nowhere after long sideways movement only to be followed by either sideway movement or slow bleed on pathetic volume:

https://i.imgur.com/bpo5oOC.png

Take a look at the most recent pump up to 7K, it instantanously liquidated about 700 short positions:

https://i.imgur.com/3sCLEB8.png

This is what all the BARTs we have seen stem from. Its not George Soros pumping Bitcoin for shits and giggles, nor is it whales. They have no incentive to try and pull off PnDs now that it only leads to either sideways movement or decline until the next pump, as it seems that most people have learned not to bite by now. Those who do want to bet on further upward movements seem to be doing it off the spot market, using margin and tight stops with futures and perp swaps on Bitmex. Exchanges like Bitfinex and Bitmex on the other hand have every incentive right now to do exactly what we are seeing.",1523278075

"First of all, the entire point is that according to Bitcoin's only accepted Sybil-resistant method for evolving (Nakamoto consensus), SegWit alone has **never** been approved. OTOH, SegWit2x *was* approved, but that has never been fully enacted, and was instead used deceptively to sneak SegWit in the back door.  

Secondly, Blockstream and Core work endlessly to ensure that *they alone* are in the position to control exactly this. This was not unknown territory at all. Either the BTC1 group was in collaboration with elements in the ""SegWit at all costs"" faction all along, or there were elements within BTC1 working against that group's interests, or BTC1 was simply manipulated completely. The end result was quite predictable once the false ""SegWit first, hard fork later"" proposal was floated.  

This is obvious because everyone with intimate knowledge of SegWit knew from the beginning that it is in no way a real ""soft fork"", but actually a disguised hard fork (I explain in detail how this can be see to be so in [this comment thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7tnrvu/nist_report_confirms_bitcoin_is_a_fork_and/dtdyo5u/)), so there was never any reason to do the two separately. But all those that understand this within Blockstream and Core will never admit this fact publicly (that this is the case can still be determined by examining the earliest internal criticism of the ""Anyone-Can-Spend"" methodology: several devs realized this purported ""soft fork"" methodology was really just a disguised hard fork, but their objections and criticisms were quickly swept under the rug, and discussion of the fact became verboten). Both SegWit and 2x should've been activated at the same time (in fact, all the problems with SegWit should've been corrected also by enacting it in a clean hard fork form).  

It's obvious to me that the primary motivation to perpetuate the false contention that SegWit is a ""soft fork"" is to reinforce the narrative that hard forks are disastrously risky, which is a key propaganda for ensuring Core's control of BTC. Somewhat ironically, since the BCH fork, the ridiculousness of this contention has been aptly demonstrated by the dozens of other BTC chain forks that have occurred with little impact.  

The key point is, if there is deceptive or unethical behavior in the community it should be widely condemned. Bitcoin was created with a clear plan and a prescribed, Sybil-resistant methodology for its evolution. Those that disagree or that can't achieve this Nakamoto Consensus within Bitcoin should've never gotten involved in the project to begin with, or simply started separate projects to compete openly. Instead, just about every unethical technique known has been deployed. The result has (to me) been surprisingly effective, resulting in the BTC block chain being irreversibly hijacked.  

&gt; A proposal to inactivate segwit should have been started.  

This raises a major problem: although if Core were ethical, they could release software that disables new SegWit use until true miner support is established, the code itself can never be removed anymore without rolling back the block chain. SegWit transactions that have already occurred must always be validated, so the code itself can never be fully removed from BTC anymore. And Core would never release code to fix their unethical behavior, because the situation itself would've never arisen without copious unethical behavior on their part to begin with.  

This SegWit block chain pollution is what the BCH fork avoided, and it is why Bitcoin Cash was forced to perform a hard fork while still a hash rate minority.",1523277603

why I am saying this? Because first of all, bitcoin came as a result on market manipulation, corrupt banking system and widespread injustice on financial market back in 2008.
Recently, it was often heard that cryptocurrencies markets do not need a regulation, and it was raising a red flag to me. Because it is like saying we do not need cops.. well, guess who will come then, and who would rule? Yes, gangs and criminals.
Well, with such liquid market and possible high gains, it was a call to those kinds of people.. and cryptocurrency society didn't do anything to regulate itself, but instead of that, YT is full of videos tagged with #Lambo, #toTheMoon, etc..

You didn't quote him, you paraphrased. This is rich, coming from someone who just got finished trying to misrepresent my own behavior by saying I was pretending to quote Satoshi literally when I had actually said ""Satoshi *pretty much* said"" and went on to provide a faithful summary of what Satoshi said (while even providing a direct link to see the exact context and quote in question).

No shame, huh? You're just willing to outright lie, it seems.

&gt;You most definitely did, see:

&gt;&gt;So the whole idea of ""making Bitcoin into an Ethereum-like protocol"" was shot down by Satoshi years before Vitalik even started paying attention to cryptocurrency.

&gt;It looks as if you're using an assumption of what Satoshi said to make the LITERAL point that he ""shot down ethereum-like protocols""

Nope, and if you had bothered to click the actual link, you'd see that I wasn't making any assumptions whatsoever. Satoshi actually *did* shoot down the idea of making Bitcoin into an Ethereum-like protocol. **See the thread I linked, it's all there.** No assumptions necessary.

"BTC has more moneyness than USD(Debit/Deposit). I think OP forgot to differentiate USD(Cash) from USD(Deposit). I would argue that CHF/EUR(Cash) comes probably more handy, less inflation, higher denomination and reasonably easy to exchange.

I think your conclusion really depends on location. Also figuring out your exchange rate will probably require some sort of electronic device. I'd say everything Bitcoin needs is ubiquitous (I checked my emails in the middle of the Sahara), but of course, you can always contend this with constructing some scenario, no need to quarrel.

"&gt;because my inventory is not valued in btc,  

No need to be, when you charge the product, you input the value in fiat and your wallet will show up the value in BTC. Why is so difficult to understand this simple process? There are tons of videos and solutions for POS systems with BTC if you really want to fully integrate your BTC wallet into your accounting apps. But is not really not necessary. When is about to take the money, just show up a watch only wallet, put the amount in fiat and then show to the customer the generated QR code that already includes the amount in BTC. Customer just scan&amp;pay. Now you have recorded your sale as usual in your existing system, you pay taxes as usual for your sales. Bitcoin is just another payment method.

"One is gaining merchant adoption, one is losing it. Seems like a good solution to me. 

You're forgetting that the block size debate was raging far longer than the segwit debate. A compromise was made, that segwit would be enabled and then 2mb blocks would be enabled in the following months. The people behind BCH(not roger at the time, he supported it later), foresaw that the core devs would never ever allow a block size increase(otherwise the 2 year debate wouldn't have happened) and forked off to bitcoin cash. Roger's support came later when it became clear 2mb blocks wouldn't happen. All he ever wanted was a Bitcoin that scaled. Once it was clear to everyone that BTC wouldn't scale, that's when the full support came to BCH.

Keep in mind, during the 2 year ""debate"" it wasn't really a debate. Anyone who supported bigger blocks was censored and no real discussion actually happened. Everyone in crypto is well aware that r/bitcoin is censored to hell, which is why r/btc came about in the first place, long before BCH ever forked. Just so happens that people who value open discussions and despise censorship frequent r/btc, hence why it is highly pro BCH today. The person behind the @Bitcoin twitter account falls into that same category.

If you genuinely think that BCH is ""Roger's and Bitmain's coin"", take a look at the development that's happening with BCH. There are exciting things just around the corner. Old op codes are being re-enabled that were disabled by core devs on the BTC chain, Cointext.io is in beta where you can text BCH to anyone in any supported regions and it's all done on chain, for example, I can text my friend in Australia BCH and I'm in Canada, no app required, no internet required, just something that can send and receive texts. BCH works today as a currency, not in some distant future where lightning network may or may not work(LN was recently DDOS'd if no one told you). 

Read both sides and come to a conclusion, but to keep your head in the sand is to miss out on opportunity. Everyone in this sub is here for the money. BCH is chasing the real value.",1523276727

"It has long been noted that BTC fails if the network fails.  It is one of many increasing number of things in our lives that depends on the network.  Using gold as currency (should a system for that ever be put in place) would likely be problematic because any method of validating the gold (like checking the stamped serial number against a database) would depend on the network.

The days where people would trust a milled coin as a significant value are long gone.  Maybe we should bring back inherently valuable objects to use as currency.  Like cigarettes or cattle.

I would favor a beer currency.  That way, if society collapses, you could drink your money and still be happy.",1523276666

Second, just because some taxation is used for bad things, doesn't mean it is bad in general.

"Payment channels to bitpay coinbase ect would make way more sense than the over complicated lightning network... As you would not need fraud protection i guess it would be more secure as well.

Maybe BCH can get something working with bitpay. It would be a very good stepping stone, until merchants want to actually hold crypto.",1523276329
"I get what you are saying, and probably most do.  Comparing BTC and gold is instructive.  But what I found annoying is that this video purports to be doing research on acceptance of BTC versus that of gold when used as currency.  That gold is rarely used as currency because of the difficulty in verifying the gold should be obvious to anyone with 3/4 of a brain; you don't need research to make that point.  So nothing non-obvious is gained by the original content, and I find it insulting that they assume I don't know something so obvious.

Gold could be used as currency, but it isn't.  BTC is used as currency, but not nearly as much as national currencies.

If you want to get something out of this, you could argue that adoption of BTC as currency has been limited for the same reason gold is limited as a currency.  Namely, something people find better is being used (national currencies).",1523276327

"""Merchants that accept BTC should keep BTC"" The reality is very very few do. What you want merchants to do is a long way off. A very long way off into the future. 

Your use case is very rare, it's exceedingly hard for 95% of use to follow suit.
The fact is if you had entered the Bitcoin world in December 2017 (and not 2015) the BTC savings from your salary would be worth less than half right now. That is not acceptable, a viable crypto-currency must be relatively price stable. You are lucky that Bitcoin has increased in value since 2015, it could have stalled and gone backwards.  Keep in mind for your employer to pay you, they must convert $ to BTC and for 90% of the merchants you deal with they also have to convert BTC to $. Whilst you can manage to use BTC for day to day spending there is always a $ - BTC - $ conversion going on in the background, therefore BTC is not being used natively. 

Like you I can also spend my BTC for day to day purchases, but unlike you I do so in a totally unrestricted manner, I can spend it anywhere and everywhere. But I convert BTC - $ and then charge up my debit card, I do this because I am resigned to the fact that at this point if I want to spend BTC there will always be a conversion going on, so I may as well perform that conversion.

"&gt; Your repeated claim ""while having no way to actual prove anything to anyone else"" is NOT CORRECT. What Gavin had, aside from the fake message, is an impression from the conversations with Craig, which is not nothing 

It *is* nothing. When the two possibilities are: 

1) Craig is Satoshi.  
2) Craig is a conman pretending to be Satoshi.

I can’t blame Gavin for getting sucked-in by a charismatic conman who had clearly done his homework and spent a bunch of time [manufacturing evidence](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89bui6/buterin_about_csw_why_is_this_fraud_allowed_to/dwr1fwv/) to link him to Bitcoin. But I do blame Gavin for taking a long time to step back from his claims when basically everyone in the community pointed out how ridiculous the situation had been.

Gavin’s own description of the signing ceremony he went through with Craig sounds exactly like a Vegas magician setting up a trick. Craig even had an assistant (I’m gonna go out on a limb and guess it was an attractive young woman) to bring in the tamper-proof brand new laptop. 

Gavin got duped. Then he got embarrassed. And eventually he made a post which acknowledged how utterly ridiculous Craig’s claims look after all the debunked evidence had piled up.

&gt;No one could counter it, some were agreeing with Greg reluctantly and then it was mysteriously deleted. I'm inclined to believe what he is saying.

That’s fine, it was the point of my first comment we always returns to appeal to authority.


&gt;It has two main parts; a block relay scheme and a restructuring of the p2p network.

&gt;The block relay scheme appears to misunderstand the objective; it focuses exclusively on bandwidth and talks about things like a 4x reduction -- but this is a reduction from 20,000 bytes to 5000 bytes-- a savings which seldom matters at all. 

Here Gmax dismisses a 75% size improvements..

And that compared to a Xthin block, that are already very optimized.

Let me remind you the alternative is: transmitting a full block: 1.000.000 bytes.

1.000.000 bytes block are transmitted with 5.000 bytes of data.

But I agree if you keep the blocksize limited to 1MB the gain is minimum (as I said no orphans block in months so propagating full 1MB is not a problem).

For BCH that to scale onchain is an immense improvement.

&gt;But the goals for block relay should be to minimize latency and adding increased potential for round trips or massively increased cpu computation (as is the case here) doesn't achieve that goal. Moreover, in settings where statefulness is acceptable (E.g. in our blocksat relay) and a difference of a few thousands bytes might matter other schemes can already transmit blocks in a few hundred bytes on average (template differencing, in particular-- my older code for it which has to treat all segwit txn as a template miss codes current blocks to a mean size of 686 bytes per block, not including the coinbase txn), much smaller than the approach in the paper-- and without any consensus changes to Bitcoin.

He basically compare Graphene to compact block.

Not graphen to **no** propagation optimisation (sending the whole data throughout the network)

He basically say that saving 75% od data is a bad tradeoff compare to the computational cost.

That I guess will have to be discussed when graphene will be implemented. I see no big problem with that if a miner find too costly (computational ressources wise) he can revert to an implementation that run Xthin/compact block.

He will have to decide between data and processing power.





&gt;It's not shock the kind of set reconciliation suggested there was previously suggested (second section) and implemented; and found to be a lot slower in practice due to overheads.

&gt;What a lot of people miss about this and compact blocks and what not, is that they at most save the system from sending transaction data twice-- once at block time, once earlier. So further tweaking here or there, which might still be helpful, still doesn't make much difference in overall bandwidth usage, because once the duplication is largely gone the usage is due to other factors. So people going on saying that this allows 10x larger blocks or whatever are just confused-- it doesn't allow 10x larger blocks any more than compact blocks allowed 50x larger blocks. If this scheme were infinity fold more efficient than compact blocks it would still only save at most half the bandwidth of the original p2p protocol (similar to what CB saves), and in practice a lot less because other overheads dominate. 

Say that CB/Xthin and graphene save only half the bandwidth is not true and naive.

It make propagation much faster and cheaper.. each node will transmit blocks **much quicker** and too **more peer**.

Depending on where your node fit on the network topology it might save a lot of data (because your nodes transmitted to many peers) or **0** (because transmit no block to other typically because other nodes know about the block.. your node is the last to know)

But with those optimizations a 500MB block would take much longer to propagate (and cost a lot of bandwidth to the network) that basically what latency is.


&gt;And because of reconstruction overheads in practice what it would allow for (even given its required hardfork to reorder txn) might actually be somewhat less large.

I doubt there is much recontruction overhead.

&gt;The second part is the restructuring of the P2P network. They suggest replacing the p2p flooding mesh with a miner rooted minimum spanning tree after observing that that the flooding mesh wastes a lot of bandwidth. But a minimum spanning tree has a minimum cut of one: a single broken node can shadow the entire network. Moreover when deciding on the spanning tree a node could falsely claim to be connected directly to everyone in order to be placed near the root. So while this topology would be optimal in a world that had no dishonesty or need for fault tolerance, it doesn't really apply to Bitcoin. It isn't like people looked at this problem before and were unaware that you could build a duplication free distribution topology-- 

I discussed detail of the implementation, saying that graphene might be subject to attack.

I don’t deny that, again it is a critic of graphene not Xthin/CB.

&gt;the duplication is essential for security and robustness, not a bug.

How convenient when you company business plan rely on bitcoin not being able to scale:)

&gt;not a bug. The question of more efficient distribution in a world with broken and malicious peers in an identityless network is a very interesting one-- even just formalizing the problem statement in a useful way is an interesting question; the question of doing it in a world with perfect flawless honest parts isn't-- it's a solved problem with a well known set of viable solutions.

He might very be true, I am not too concerned if graphene end up being unworkable.

All I argue with you is implemented for a long time (beside the tx double verification optimizations, that I don’t if it has been implemented yet)

So immense progress have been made regarding latency yet people are still arguing that cannot be lager than 1MB because of that. It is getting old IMO.

"The actual consequences of RBF is it makes 0-conf transactions insecure as they can be replaced before they confirm. Despite the narrative that ""0-conf transactions are fundamentally insecure"", they had been quite secure for most of the history of bitcoin. Prior to the introduction of RBF, Bitpay would process transactions for their customers guaranteeing the dollar value without waiting for confirmations - like they do with BCH today. Another example is BitPay's debit card - top it up with BTC, and you wait for a confirmation before your funds are available to spend. Top it up with BCH, and your funds are available to spend (or withdraw as cash from an ATM) immediately.

Most importantly, RBF fundamentally breaks the use case of paying with coin in a brick and mortar store, since it would force merchants to require customers to wait for their transaction to confirm prior to leaving the store with purchased goods. Without RBF, it only takes a few seconds to confirm that a double spend was not attempted at which point the merchant can have a very high degree of confidence that the transaction will be confirmed.

Guys this isn't going to stop. You know how to beat these guys?

Let your buy money accumulate, save it for one of these non organic dumps trying to trigger panic sells, and liquidates stop loss orders. Instead just buy in on the discount. Then hold.

If you want to get fancy you can try to sell immediately after a non organic pump that tries to liquidate shorts.

I mean this shit is so obvious. It's clear they are ""next levelling"" your stop loss orders. It's clear they are next levelling your shorts. So stop doing that shit, and just time entries around their attempts.

I have actually made almost 30% doing this in the last 2 weeks while the overall market is roughly reset.

You know what happens to this whale when everyone just sits and times buys for his dumps? He throws his money into the garbage. He literally just gives away his position. 

When these non organic dumps happen and you either don't buy in, or even worse sell (or get stop losses triggered), then YOU just give your position to them.

"I don't mean to dismiss programming as easy, I first hand understand that it takes a lot of patience to learn and grow as a developer. You guys make things work and there's no arguing that. It's just that design is often an afterthought whereas it should come first in product design. UX is not about thinking where to place buttons how many clicks are needed to accomplish that, while that's certainly something we consider. UX is about looking at your product and figuring out how to simplify it down to the most basic level. When things are really easy to use, you know a designer did his or her job. Making things easy is hard work and takes practice, testing and iteration. I think if more developers realized that and works hand in hand with designers then we'd be much further along in crypto today. I hope people reading this take note and really consider starting with design first. My last post was more or less to get attention. I don't actually think of anyone as a rockstar, guru or a ninja haha and despise anyone who seriously thinks that way about themselves. ",1523273213

Wrong, it’s shitty and underdeveloped *so* the masses can use it.

In your MP3 example, you say that the product which ultimately won out was the simple/stupid large storage device. That’s not false, but it’s also not really that Apple won out so much as the tech literacy of your average user grew to the point something like Apple products became possible. First you get early adopters on the most basic, unrefined software, then you get more mainstream people on only marginally better stuff, and after they have struggled through learning how to use that for ages, someone comes up with a simplified version for the rest of the world. The early adopters and first mainstreamers who used the crappy first versions are essential to the process, as they become promoters and teachers for everyone else.

That guy sells one for for $10 (to 10 people for $1 (their salary). A new coin gets mined. Market cap is now $50. These guys are great holders and the rich guy is bored and realizes this really is the future. He wants them all back. He’s going to pay $200/BTC. The other 9 laggards see the price skyrocket and they want some too. Unfortunately , they only have their wages to buy with so they all pour in and get roughly 1/200th of a Bitcoin. The rest go back to the rich guy, as much as the other 10 clear their debt and hold the rest. They end up debt free with 0.1 BTC left. The rich guy mines another and is now fabulously wealthy. He really wants to pump the price up now, or alternatively the other 9 see their friends clear their debt. Maybe the rich guy wants to dump on the price to scare the shit out of the holders and buy cheap (use your imagination). Let’s say the other 9 bid up the price and with their next salary of $1 each they each buy at $20,000 good bing them 1/20000 of a BTC.

Right now, the biggest good use case for crypto continues to be ransomware and illegal purchases.  Realistically speaking, no one gives a damn about blockchain if all it means in practical terms is no refunds, no charge backs, no recourse when things go wrong, no tracability, no accountability, and no cash back.  It's worse in every way except privacy.  The thing about financial privacy is that governments ultimately control financial privacy and cryptos can't really count on offering this to any meaningful extent for long.

Also of note for those who are angry about the mention of bch using bitcoin core code.

"I actually wrote a paper if bitcoin fulfills all the necessary points of being money in college around 2 years ago. The main critique was, that money should make it easy for people to, know somethings worth. If value of bitcoin is fluctuation at the rate it has over the past years, this function is not fulfilled. 

The classic old bitcoin joke is relevant here: A boy asked his Bitcoin-investing dad...

...for $10.00 worth of Bitcoin currency.

Dad: $9.67? What do you need $10.32 for?

This would also apply to goods in a supermarket, if you hypothesise if you could pay there with bitcoin, and would make it a hassle for consumers and sellers.

Of course bitcoin fulfills some functions of being money, like ""store of value"", but not all of them. Another function is, that you need to be able to transform your wealth from today into the future (and I'm not talking long term). If there is a relatively high chance of the price crashing within a year, than also this function of money is not fulfilled.

I'm not saying bitcoin cannot be money. All this problems center around the volatility, which should resolve itself by mass adoption in the long term. But right now, one could argue bitcoin is not good in being money.

Excited about your replies.

"&gt;This is now beyond my level of understanding. 

To put it simply, latency came from time it take to propagate a block + the time it take to verify a block.

This could be used by a dishonest miner, by building a specific block very large and very difficult to verify.

That way the dishonest get a headstart by mining on top of his block while the rest of the network stay idle and can’t mine until the block is fully verified

This advantage increased the large mining operations you have therefore increasing centralisation.

What graphene/Xthin/compact block does it to create a list of tx instead of sending the whole block.

The miner just use the list to reconstruct the block from the list they have without needing to download the block (because nodes already have the transactions)

The results is the latency time has become:

* time to download the “list” (now only a fraction of the total block size

* time to reconstruct the block (negligible)

* time to verify tx (disappeared, tx was already verified by the node)

Now latency is nearly no more affected by the blocksize.



&gt;Had I seen the links you provided and no rebuttal from someone who I know knows what they are talking about I would be as convinced as yourself. 

I am not sure what rebutal you are looking for?

The link show graphene and how far block propagation optimisation can go.

&gt;However the quote I provided was from Greg Maxwell and if he did said anything that was untrue it would be called out immediately as a means to discredit his technical ability, many people would jump at the chance, as it was not done one can assume what he was saying is almost certainly correct.

I am sorry but you are making yet another appeals to authority here.

Gmax has been quote lying many times (like when it argue with me that 4MB WU was equal to 4MB under previous rules)

Can you provide the link of your quote so I can understand what critic he makes.

Saying that savings bandwidth is missing the point is a rather extraordinary statement.

Coming from him I fully expect yet another FUD statment.

&gt;If there has been a debate on this between him and another respected member of the community where he was proven wrong that would also suffice. Not just a random poster on r/btc, unless it turns out I'm speaking to a well known and established academic right now.

Do you realize you are making huge appeal to authority again.

"Absolutely, I completely agree with you, it is the first time I see something actually priced in a cryptocurrency, and that is pretty thrilling.

It is strange visiting a Bitcoin Cash merchandise store advocating for crypto as the better money, then listing the price of some merch in 10USD, with a flucuating converted BCH price next to it. It is almost ironic.

They could at least have a fixed Bitcoin Cash price and the option of paying a fluctuating USD price.

I like your solution best, put a fixed USD and BCH price and let customers decide.

There are three main options with a fixed price.

* Set the price to be the exchange rate at some fixed point (start of year, the day of setting the price) and keep it.

* Set the price with an added premium and keep that price fixed.

* Set the price with an rebate and keep that price fixed.

As you say, on average it will swing in both directions and cancel out, and it is an extra option. The fact that you keep prices stable even when it is unprofitable for you is an example of you honoring the principle, which people generally respect even when it does not go in their favor at any given day.",1523269632

yes, of course I'm stupid and you are smart. hell yeah

&gt; there are actually no reasons for your position at all.

stalling segwit was real, propaganda is real. end of story

&gt; The definition of ""a block"" was changed during the segwit soft fork.

""r"" is inside the word ""tree"" as much as signatures are inside segwit's transactions which are inside segwit blocks. denying it is a lie. and i have checked so i'm sure of it and i'm sure about the propaganda. there is no argument to be made, just facts

&gt;active nodes prior to that activation do not see those signatures or even acknowledge their existence

0.12 core does not see blocks bigger than 1MB either
what happens is that a 0.16 node before sending ""tree"" to a 0.12 one cuts out the ""r"" and just sends ""tee"" so that the 0.12 node can see the block.

you seem to not understand what a softfork means, i'll explain to you: 
no soft fork can be validated by old software by definition. so no wonder that 0.12 cannot validate segwit which is exactly what happens with EVERY softfork

&gt; you've convinced yourself of a counterfactual narrative, and you're sticking to it, no matter what. Your facts and reasoning are flatly incorrect.

Think about this. What if the USD went to zero, crashed, hyperinflated, whatever. What would the dollar price of one bitcoin be?

During hyperinflation one coffee could cost $1 billion dollars.  In that situation what would one bitcoin be worth?

If your measuring bitcoin in dollars then there is no known limit, therefore its potentially unlimited until a limit is known.

Given if the dollar is turned into confetti through hyperinflation then no one would want dollars and you wouldnt want to be measuring bitcoin in dollars.

&gt; Why do we need exchanges?

Trading and exchanging large amounts of money.

&gt; Just offer to accept BTC / USD for everything in your personal 
&gt; life

Which is pathetically small compared to the income you do not get in BTC. How do you move 5000, 10000, 20000 USD into BTC as saving with this approach? Hint: you do not. YOu need a seller.

&gt; Selling your old Iphone? On that ad say you'll take BTC or USD, 
&gt; BTC preferred.

So, being broke is your solution? First, that may not work too well - we still are not on a case where you can do that easily on Ebay (loose protection) and second - this is really a special case. ""I am broke, selling my iphone for BTC"". I dont think I have sold anything in the las 6 months - and still I had to get a significant amount of bitcoin as I move my savings into it. An exchange faclilitates this without a lot of problems - which for example localbitcoins has. It is muchj easier to keep an acocunt at an exchange, SEPA money there ,buy, then move the funds to a hardware wallet.

And people that work and need to move nontrivial amounts simply will not bother with the ""how can I sell my household to get btc"".

I sold a lot of art at art fairs in different countries so Bitcoin was a great solution for people that wanted to pay in cash in person.

"**Moneyness**

In finance, moneyness is the relative position of the current price (or future price) of an underlying asset (e.g., a stock) with respect to the strike price of a derivative, most commonly a call option or a put option. Moneyness is firstly a three-fold classification: if the derivative would make money if it were to expire today, it is said to be in the money, while if it would not make money it is said to be out of the money, and if the current price and strike price are equal, it is said to be at the money. There are two slightly different definitions, according to whether one uses the current price (spot) or future price (forward), specified as ""at the money spot"" or ""at the money forward"", etc.

This rough classification can be quantified by various definitions to express the moneyness as a number, measuring how far the asset is in the money or out of the money with respect to the strike – or conversely how far a strike is in or out of the money with respect to the spot (or forward) price of the asset.

"&gt;If you will presume a fully connected mining network, then ""there is no way for the SM to ever win the race against any HM"" is a true statement, because all honest miners already have the block you're trying to ""beat"" by the time you leaned about it.

How do you figure? HM broadcasts to all miners including SM. The broadcast has different latencies for getting to different miners. SM sees the broadcast before some set of miners S, and a subset of that set of miners S' it has lower latency connections to than HM does. Why can't this happen? Is this only thing that might delay miner propagation the speed of light? There's no queuing delay or packet loss? And all network paths between miners are geographically the shortest distance between one another?

&gt;He said it one time while talking all over himself in front of a large, obviously hostile audience.

&gt;Occam's Razor is that he was winging it without notes and he misspoke.

Why does he seem to double-down on the negative gamma point without your elaboration in this thread:

https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/88acc6/eli5_why_the_one_who_actually_doesnt_understand/dwkw2f3/?context=3

&gt;Counterproductive, as in, since you started at zero in this fully connected network, it's like gamma goes negative if, instead of relaying directly to other miners, you use nonmining relays as a proxy.

&gt;TLDR ""Said the thing wrong, had the right idea, may be making a great point, but nobody wants to hear it because none of us, myself included, really like the guy.""

I think you and Craig are both conflating ""gamma,"" the ratio of honest nodes who accept the SM's equal-length chain during the race with HMs, with some variable that refers to the increase in revenue from adding 0-hash power sybil nodes. These are not the same things at all. And in so far as this is the interpretation of gamma that renders intelligible what Craig is saying, he's still wrong to strawman the SM paper like this because this is not what gamma means and adding 0-hash power sybils is not the only way one might try to increase gamma.",1523268070

"&gt; You are equating people that live with less than $2 per day with people that live in a corrupt country with rampant violence. It is fallacious IMO to generalize this and your argument falls apart then.

no i am not. most developing countries have issues with corruption, violence, and laxity of moral, legal and ethical frameworks (unless they come from religion). Please point me to a country that is underdeveloped,but does not have high crime rates or state corruption. if you can find me some examples, i will stand corrected.

&gt; If the tech-savy and educated can teach the tech-unsavy how to use for example CoinText, it can help the free markets.

this is not how class divides operate. You can look to any country for an example of this. 

&gt; It is true that cash is king, but if you have rampant inflation, which often occurs in countries such as Nigeria for example, cash is trash and BCH on the other hand is likely to increase in value in those local markets.

so now you are saying that BCH is a cure for hyperinflation?

&gt; The goal is to bank the unbanked, and it is a long-term goal, but it sure ain't gonna happen with a cryptocurrency that has $50 - $100 fees during times of network overload.

i am not talking about BTC/BCH. this is the simplistic narrative you are trying to peddle. I couldn't give a shit about the BTC/BCH debate. In my minds there are two forks, with two roadmaps. That is the end of that. 

What i am attempting to communicate is that the developing world has much more serious problems that cryptocurrency can fix.

Bitcoin.org should support Bitcoin Cash for that use unless you think no Bitcoin should be used for that purpose. Your current action/inaction suggests you support any other crypto taking that role. This makes you an anti-Bitcoin Cash actor (even if you see/admit it will most likely assume that role for the people of the world).",1523266811

"I agree with this completely but this doesn't mean that we can't still dumb things down. This is wayyyy down the line but imagine having a single app that functions as a wallet and an exchange that hold/trades all cryptos with whatever pairs you want?

And yes everyone will have their own public/private key but what if you could, for example, input a family or friends address and name it ""Bob"" - similar to how a name in your contacts is just a 9 digit phone number underneath. 


Crypto is currently mostly a grey area right now and we won't know what can and can't be done until things start ironing themselves out. I personally believe there will be options for people who prefer others controlling their money (at the price of easier usability) and people who prefer to do things themselves.

Also, in any country there's always part of the population that is educated and part that is uneducated. If the tech-savy and educated can teach the tech-unsavy how to use for example CoinText, it can help the free markets.

Roger stated that “we” (the world population or perhaps more specifically the Bitcoin community at large) have failed to deliver a level of economic freedom that would (factually) lead to a reduction in infant mortality. So the only point you can argue here is that point.

"Safe: depends on the site. Some are legit, some are scams. You should generally be okay with the bigger, better established sites

Legal: depends on your jurisdiction - if Bitcoin is legal in your country/state, mining it is likely legal too. Your biggest legal question is likely to be tax laws

Profitable: almost certainly not. I’ve had a few mining contracts for 18 months or so since I got involved with Crypto, and I’ve still only seen about 60% of that amount returned ($ value) on any of them, even with the last 12 months being fairly profitable for crypto mining. I’m not too upset since I only bought a few $30 contracts to see how they worked and what the return was like, but I certainly can’t recommend it.

If you want to invest in Crypto, you’re almost certainly better off buying the coins directly than buying mining contracts. Mining margins, particularly for Bitcoin, are thin anyway - by the time the cloud mining takes enough of a cut to be profitable, there’s basically nothing left for you. I’ve had an average payout of perhaps a dollar a month on each $30 contract, so about $18-20 return so far including the more profitable summer, and $0 profit... while $30 of Bitcoin bought 18 months ago is worth about $300 now. Obviously last year is an unusual one with the crazy price rises, but mining profits were up too.

I doubt I’ll even break even on the 2 year contracts. And if the lifetime ones were truly lifetime, I’d buy some to have the permanent little trickle of Bitcoin income. But even the lifetime ones generally have a fixed fee and are therefore basically guaranteed to stop being profitable after a couple of years, because a fixed fee can’t ever keep up with a rising difficulty. They might just about break even, but I’m not expecting a profit on them.

I really can’t recommend a cloud mining contract.",1523262823

It was a good thing to Core because their goal was to move payments to a 2nd-layer solution and off bitcoin, so damaging the ability of BTC to do payments actually served their goal of getting payments off of the BTC blockchain.

This was an intensely foolish move.

At the SV conference recently we are now also talking about orphaning double-spend transactions entirely. If you even try to DS, the system/miners will ignore both transactions. This is better than trying to guess which is valid or which came first, since it's almost impossible to determine that.

Friedrich Hayek  (; German: [ˈfʁiːdʁɪç ˈaʊ̯ɡʊst ˈhaɪɛk]; 8 May 1899 – 23 March 1992), born in Austria-Hungary as Friedrich August von Hayek and frequently referred to as F. A. Hayek, was an Austrian-British economist and philosopher best known for his defense of classical liberalism. Hayek shared the 1974 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with Gunnar Myrdal for his ""pioneering work in the theory of money and economic fluctuations and ... penetrating analysis of the interdependence of economic, social and institutional phenomena"".

Hayek was a major social theorist and political philosopher of the twentieth century, and his account of how changing prices communicate information that helps individuals co-ordinate their plans is widely regarded as an important achievement in economics, leading to his Nobel Prize.

"&gt; If someone sends two conflicting transactions that both spend the same coins but to different outputs, and one has a much higher miner fee than the other, why would a rational miner not just always accept the one with the higher fee? 

Because it is against the 'rules', although these rules are not enforced, so miners could do whatever they want. 

Marking transactions as replaceable makes more sense though. 

&gt;Will other miners really orphan a block if it contains a conflicting transaction with one they have in their mempool? And if so, on what grounds ?

No, if you got this gem from Craig Wright then I have news for you: orphaning blocks based these kind of conflicting transactions is impossible. Craig was technobabling, because he doesn't understand how Bitcoin works

&gt; if you think that the situation in a country is such that citizens phones are neither safe on the street nor on the phone, I think that family savings in fiat or precious metals isn't much safer either...

this is not true - as there is a banking system that is emerging. it is there to service the poor. They can be relatively safe and secure in the knowledge that their money is kept safe in the bank, and they can access it when they need. This is the incumbent model - i know - but you don't seem to realise the security that an armed force protected bank gives you in a country where violent gun and knife crime is rife.

"**Lies, damned lies, and statistics**

""Lies, damned lies, and statistics"" is a phrase describing the persuasive power of numbers, particularly the use of statistics to bolster weak arguments. It is also sometimes colloquially used to doubt statistics used to prove an opponent's point.

The term was popularised in United States by Mark Twain (among others), who attributed it to the British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli: ""There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics."" However, the phrase is not found in any of Disraeli's works and the earliest known appearances were years after his death. Several other people have been listed as originators of the quote, and it is often erroneously attributed to Twain himself.

Blockchain is not a chain, in fact. It is a ""blocktree"" of all valid blocks that stem from the genesis block. Only with something like Bitcoin there is a (relatively weak) incentive to always extend the tip, thus going from *tree* to *chain*.

All of the Bitcoin competitors are significantly more centralized than Bitcoin. But if a more centralized thing were to take over, then it would make sense that it uses another structure that is better and more scalable, like DAG or hashgraph, not a blockchain.",1523259528

"&gt; I’m saying that at absolute best, Gavin went public with his support of Craig as Satoshi without having any proof in hand to back that up.

No. He said about the private communication with Wright: ""This is a person who knows an awful lot about Bitcoin and an awful lot about early Bitcoin stuff, the email conversations I had [with him] sounded like Satoshi to me. It sounded like I was talking to the same person I’d worked with way back when. "" While this is not a proof Wright had access to Satoshi's private keys, it can support the fact that Wright was on the Satoshi team. It's possible that another member on that team (meybe Kleiman) had the access to the keys, and that Wright was unable to produce this evidence EVEN THOUGH HE WAS PART OF THE SATOSHI TEAM.

&gt; I just explicitly explained that Gavin can’t be absolutely 100% sure, and that’s why he has learned from his previous mistake and doesn’t want to state an absolute opinion on the topic anymore. 

Again, You didn't ""explain"" anything, just stated your opinion without any objective evidence to support it.

&gt; Cryptographic keys are not meant to be used to prove your identity in-person it was an utterly ridiculous charade that Gavin really should have seen through.

Really? suppose you research and write a book about Satoshi. Someone, who appears to be extremely similar to his writing style and knowledge level, approaches you. Wouldn't you meet him? Of course you would. You'll still require the private keys, but nevertheless YOU WILL MEET WITH HIM. Yes, he didn't check the keys were publickly known before acknowledging Wright is Satoshi, but even bright people are not always the best detectives.

There IS an explanation to this (and Gavin knows this), which is not that unlikely. Either Wright could be part of a Satoshi team with the other part of the team not currently available (due to e.g. death), or maybe Wright was afraid of the consequences of being Satoshi (see what happened to e.g. Assange). Maybe it's neither and Wright is a scammer, but boycotting anything he says about every issue? That's not what Gavin meant and was NOT said anywhere in his post.",1523258431

Either bitcoin scales off-chain (via LN and other mechanisms) and the backlog and fees remain low (as they are at the moment) - or bitcoin fails. I'm assuming your paper is about bitcoin and doesn't cover altcoins.

Electricity consumption may be an ecological issue but it's not an endogenous limit. At the extreme, bitcoin mining uses so much electricity that electricity prices rise as a consequence, which causes some mining to become unprofitable and drop out thus reducing power consumption.

He did profited big time (probably) when all fiat withdrawals but JPY got blocked, which lead to that sweet ""Gox premium"". ",1523257818
"&gt;Block size ... But the backlog and the fees it's generating make me feel it can be considered as a limit to the bitcoin model

Either bitcoin scales off-chain (via LN and other mechanisms) and the backlog and fees remain low (as they are at the moment) - or bitcoin fails. I'm assuming your paper is about bitcoin and doesn't cover altcoins.

Electricity consumption may be an ecological issue but it's not an endogenous limit. At the extreme, bitcoin mining uses so much electricity that electricity prices to rise as a consequence, which causes some mining to become unprofitable and drop out thus reducing power consumption.

"Ah, this is what I'm alluding to.

There is a base support level to a currency based upon how many people are using / hodling it at any given time.

We can observe that at this level of adoption, *so far*, $7,000USD/BTC is the sustained price. Will it go lower? It could, sure, but adoption is on the rise...",1523257758
hm if BTC drop NEO will most likely drop again as well. not sure if its worth getting into it now,1523257743
"0 confirm transaction acceptance is downright irresponsible on BCH considering how little hashpower it has compared to BTC. Double spends can be performed with high degree of probability with a small fraction of BTC hashpower. 

So it confirms on-chain in an average of 10 mins, just like BTC. Except BTC has something like 12x the PoW on each block. 

What does any of this have to do with this SMS service, exactly?",1523257738
"I think his reasoning makes sense but Price Speculation will be a big factor for new investors. What is the next Bitcoin? What is the next 10 X investment?

Bitcoin is here to stay but I don't know about the others. Many do not have clear use case/reason to be on the blockchain. Many projects are centralized and can go down to regulation. I think BTC will have a long term value while others fluctuate/die off until they establish a clear use case that makes sense.",1523257699
While I can't disagree. It's surely up there and one of the easiest to use. Personally I use it and Litecoin to transact. I don't bother with Bitcoin core. ,1523257678
Dorsey has been on a censorship rampage lately.  @Bitcoin is small time property compared to many of the accounts he has overtly banned.,1523257638
The typical person will not get behind crypto until there is a viable product. Once one of these tokens takes off and we see adoption the entire outlook will change.,1523257630
"Also after SITs report, you and me both can be jailed for selling crypto via otc. If the person at the other end is some criminal

Haha. Support more",1523257582
"The amount of req burned will be adjusted according to its value. The token burn is a way to ensure growth in the token value if the network is adopted. Any transaction on the request network, any crypto or fiat, will burn req on the backend, so you dont have to hold req to use the network. But i don't get what you are saying with it reaching a limit. Its the most basic economic model. As the demand increases, supply goes down and the price goes up. ",1523257546
"&gt; Your premise that Jack Dorsey is a ""stand-up guy"" who wouldn't abuse his power doesn't hold any water.

That doesn’t look like OP’s premise at all. 

Facebook’s dodgy relationships to analytics companies were quietly happening behind the scenes. They had every reason to believe they could keep those things completely secret, *and* we have no idea how much they were being paid for access.

By contrast, the banning of notable Twitter accounts can’t go unnoticed. It was guaranteed to cause a shitstorm. And as OP noted the public investment of Jack Dorsey in LN or whatever is peanuts. So unless he also has a secret side investment of a billion or two in BTC, it really wouldn’t make a lot of sense for him to damage Twitter’s reputation just to benefit his tiny LN investment.",1523257349
"This bear market showed me why I shouldn't be too greedy.. had bought $1000 worth of crypto which became $5000 worth in a month. My greedy ass, after reading how much gains 2018 would bring in this sub and in the media, wanted to atleast make it $10,000 before I cash out.

And now here I am with my portfolio reduced to $200. ",1523257321
