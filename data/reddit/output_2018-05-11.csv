Maybe as long as cryptos aren't mainstream. Long term I think Bitcon Cash has nothing outstanding and surely isn't Bitcoin. Guess what will happen to coins like that.,1526108292
Well before you couldnt short btc or eth.. now you can. So that drives price down.,1526108225
"Ok, but there's no cause and effect there. There is simply no rational basis for referring to Bitcoin as Bitcoin Core. It's simple gaslighting, meant to diminish Bitcoin by presenting it as a ""version"" of Bitcoin, equivalent to Bitcoin Cash. That symmetry is complete fiction with no purpose other than helping Bitcoin Cash appear legitimate. Whatever feud you refer to, trying to rename Bitcoin just doesn't follow.",1526108224
"All right... yes, you should not buy bitcoin then! Btw, there are some structured products which grew amazingly in price. I don’t understand what they do but they would be a better investment for you... probably.",1526108193
When you buy ETH or BTC do you have access to it immediately? As in can you transfer it to a different wallet right away? I currently have my checking account linked and it takes up to a week to get access to my purchased coins.,1526108067

I don't get the question. If it's not eth it's btc what else u wanna buy?,1526107812
And people at this subreddit made fun of Bill Gates a couple of days ago for talking about shorting Bitcoin. This is excactly why people short BTC. Maybe Gates is smart after all.,1526107736
"Ethereum is essentially just a share in the founders company. There is no official entity so it looks decentralised,  but everyone knows when you buy eth you are buying into Vitalik's and Joe lubins ability to pump the value of it. It is literally a stock, the only difference is that it uses blockchain and the bitcoin exchanges rather than a central clearing house... ",1526107704
"hey, i would have been better off to put nothing in

sadly, i did put money in, and lost money

since my orig comment, bitcoin down another $500

the ship is sinking faster now",1526107696
Eth is fastest to send and more stable to trade than btc ,1526107681

"&gt; What's the downside to Ethereum and how is it centralized?

The downside is that it makes bitcoins scaling problem even larger, by having an even larger blockchain and still not nearly enough capacity. Dev team fully realizes that, and will address it by dropping PoW and switching to a PoS algorithm and sharding. The former comes with significant compromises in immutability and centralisation, the latter may introduce latency and possibly security concerns. That said, I dont think anyone questions that ethereum is useful, its just a different concept with different goals and different tradeoffs.

BTW, rootstock (RSK) brings smartcontracts and scaling to bitcoin, although as you might have guessed, it comes with its very own tradeoffs.",1526107447

"I don't think any 1:1 comparison here is valid.  The point of the statistic is to demonstrate that crypto is not as popular with crime as the mainstream thinks.  Many think that is all crypto is for.  While mainstream currencies are not primarily used for crime, the same can be said of crypto.  While it is feasible that more crime occurs in crypto transactions, this is largely due to the state of crypto: it is highly unregulated, is poorly understood, is outside of the mainstream's eye, and is not yet large enough to warrant the attention required to properly enforce laws around.  All this changes as it is adopted, but given how much money laundering and crime occurs off through conventional means, and the greater difficulty and future risk in crypto laundering, the common stereotype of crypto as criminal is unwarranted.",1526106518

"Someone mentioned in these comments that laundering is averse to the permanence of crypto ledgers.  I would go one step farther and point out the following:

* Paper money is often used to evade taxes, launder, or perform blackmarket transactions... all things often applied to cryptocurrency. This is the result confirmation bias.  Paper money is hard to track, and can exchange hands privately, without a record.  Blockchain has a permanent record, while exchanges maintain identification with accounts.  Similarly, the transactions of identified accounts provide useful information in identifying other individuals outside the exchange, either on another exchange, or holding a key privately.  While there are uses for cryptocurrency focused on establishing financial privacy, it is far less private than common currencies, and the ledger provides significant information that can aid with public key identification.",1526105410
"I read all kinds of ""crap"" on Reddit.. lol

I'm not a Bcash fanboy by any means. I was sincerely asking about the network as it pertained to the post.. I will always back the OG BTC, but I'm not opposed to any idea of progressing the platform in terms of adoption and sustainability.

On a different (also sincere) note, isn't Ethereum a nice addition to the blockchain network? It's in no way, shape, or form like bcash imo.

"I don’t get why people keep saying this doesn’t affect the market 
Whoever is buying hundreds of thousands of btc at once can manipulate the market down before transacting and obviously they could also dump on the market once transacted so this OTC sale actually affects the market worse than if it was directly on exchange - because the off exchange sale causes fud and panic in combination with on exchange manipulation by existing large whales that are potentially involved in the otc trades or the fallout

it seems like the end of 2017 was the end of bitcoin (as a decent investment or something that will go up in value)

of course, if you want to lose money, then yes... bitcoin seems to be the way to go

but it could be worse, i could be macafee who will have to eat his own penis!!!",1526103990

**""This is a great opportunity for the people to run their businesses unfettered by political whims.""**


Something Cobra said a month ago has really resonated with me.  It was the comment that Lightning was a threat to Bitcoin, because it provides scalability to more than just Bitcoin.

The current trajectory, at least in the US, is that dealing in crypto as a business costs far more in accounting effort than it does in revenue.  This is why businesses use Bitpay and the like to sell products in BTC while taking USD.  They don't want to deal with the exchange rate madness.  

Cobra's insight was that when stablecoins exists on the lightning network alongside BTC, I can buy something with BTC, but the merchant will only accept USD pegged coins, my lighting wallet will find a path with a BTC/USD exchange pair in the path.  Both parties get what they want.  

At this point, all bitcoin has going for it is that ""greedy fucks"" would choose it's monetary policy over any other system's monetary policy.  They they are seeking risk, then more speculative coins would be on the menu.  If they are feeling risk averse, stablecoins are probably more appetizing than BTC.  Third world nations' citizens now have currency controls to keep them storing value in the nation's token.  If they had a choice, they would store value in USD.  Maybe I am overgeneralizing here, but perhaps Bitcoin monetary policy is not at one of these extremes that the populace would alternate between depending on risk appetite.


**""no one has ever hacked the Bitcoin blockchain""**  

I never know how to respond to that.  This is the party line to tow, but there was that time in mid August 2010 with the block 74638 overflow bug.  While it was expunged from the blockchain's history, Bitcoin *was* hacked.  I guess it is easier to say than ""Bitcoin hasn't been hacked for nearly 8 years, but we undid the hack, so it's OK now"".",1526103951
"&gt; Liquid is the world's first federated sidechain that enables rapid, confidential, and secure bitcoin transfers. Participating exchanges and Bitcoin businesses deploy the software and hardware that make up the Liquid network, so that they can peg in and out of the Bitcoin blockchain and offer Liquid’s features to their traders. Liquid provides a more secure and efficient system for exchange-side bitcoin to move across the network.

Liquid is a solution for exchanged and businesses. Its not about making fees low for them. Its about making transfers instant so you dont need to wait for 6 confirmations. This is incredivly useful for exchanges as bitcoin price is so volatile.

Liquid is *exactly* as useful with free tx contra 50$ tx. So no, I dont see how that looks bad.",1526103920

I do not have the ability to start it myself; If so, I would volunteer.

I do not think that the development team of ""Bisq"" implements Bitcoin Cash as the base currency, especially because in its plans it is to remove the altcoins that had already been included as the base currency; It is really unlikely that they integrate a Bitcoin version different from BTC, especially because of their anti-BCH vision.

You're absolutely correct. However, we have to appreciate that there are two sides to a price: *supply and demand*.

And I think that is Fundstrat's argument, not so much that increased mining investment will translate into increased demand, but rather it translates into a higher price at which supply begins to dry up.

"Most of us BCH supporters assert *Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin* in terms of development. Though I can understand that this phrasing really doesn't help our case for outsiders who don't know Bitcoin's dark, twisted history to actually understand why we say this.

BTC has been curved away from its founding whitepaper and roadmap by hijackers. They added RBF which harms merchant adoption, they kept the 1mb block limitation that was always supposed to be removed \(for political and control reasons\), basically centralized development to Bitcoin Core exclusively, and are now relying on another centralized IOU system like LN to solve all the scaling issues \(which it won't even if LN works perfectly\), following the contentious addition of SegWit that drastically alters how block validation is handled. I argue that BTC in fact doesn't have a whitepaper, because the original Satoshi paper does not describe anymore what BTC is now. 

Bitcoin Cash so far has not even been so much an *upgrade* as much as a rollback of all of these shitty, contentious changes no one wanted or asked for.

"Bitcoin is very much still in beta! That doesn't mean it's not used in real-world applications; it only means that the developers aren't confident that all the bugs have been worked out.

One of the strongest arguments against renumbering Bitcoin Core to version ""17"" was that it would signal that Bitcoin is ""out of beta,"" given that version numbers below 1.0 traditionally indicate beta status. It seems, though, that a critical mass of developers believe it's time, as (last I heard) the next major release of Bitcoin Core will be numbered ""17"" rather than ""0.17"". So, at that time, one might be able to argue convincingly that Bitcoin is out of beta.",1526100839

It has the most nodes running it's software, but it is one of a couple client implementations. Interesting that you immediately believe one centralized entity is the reference client as this has never been the case. It wasn't the first client ever used, hell it wasn't even the second. So your response shows a pathetic misunderstanding of the Bitcoin protocol and the history of it's development.

&gt;it does not break the validation rules for older clients.

Then why does the Core client after 0.7.2 not sync anymore? Oh because you're a liar who has no knowledge of the Bitcoin protocol. See https://bitcoin.org/en/version-history and compatibility notes for each version. SegWit blocks do not work with clients older than 0.7.2.

Second, I saw the tweet with my own eyes. @Bitcoin had a photo of the original BTC white paper and had written above it that BCH is the original bitcoin (who knows how that logic’s works) and that it was mined before BTC. It’s so weird and desperate I couldn’t believe it. 

I totally agree that Bitcoin core is divided and BTC may be surpassed in the future due to their inability to get anything done and evolve. It may be a few years but it could totally happen. 

But, how can BTC not be the crypto currency Satoshi wanted it to be, if he/they designed it? That’s like a contractor designing a house, building it, and people saying “that’s not the house he wanted, though. Not really.”

I understand that fees and speed have removed its ability to be a digital cash currency, and so people are putting up alternatives. I just don’t like people hijacking the words of someone (Sat) and acting like they knew what he meant.

Seriously though, make sure you tell them that they should look into it more if they decide to invest. Many ways to lose your money on here and hopefully those risks decrease in the future along with easier use. 

Not sure how you are gonna handle this but here's how I break it down to peeps. I always like to start by asking everyone which is real money, showing them a pictures of items and separate fiats. People really don't know money has always been *confidence*. If you believe it's worth that, then it's worth that. We can in theory use anything as a currency. The only issue is it needs traits. Thanks to the traits of cryptocurrency, they are the next generation of record-keeping and security, at the least bitcoin.

It's also pretty hypocritical for people who dogmatically rant about ""bcash"" (not you here but above and elsewhere, others) to complain that many use a much less trolly and properly descriptive name for BTC, Bitcoin Core (which is the name of the sole implementation that mines every BTC block) and the name of the dev team that are the technocratic leaders of BTC chain and roadmap.

There is no ""true/real bitcoin"". There are multiple versions of Bitcoin though.

Try both and see for yourself. 

If you just want to HODL with the token kids, maybe you don't care. If you sold all your ""bcash"" for $600 like Bitfury George, maybe you are just spiteful to see it growing and improving while your precious BTC is failing.

What I'm trying to say is, there have always been forks and will continue to be forks. The philosophy of Bitcoin is that we continue to evolve in this way and push disagreements into the wild to find consensus and to sink or swim on their own.

But we need to be more mature about it than we currently are. Every version of Bitcoin is a fork - that's how it works. If you remember Bitcoin Cash came from a disagreement on a soft-fork to include SegWit in Bitcoin Core. Resulting in a hard fork to create larger blocks, and a split to the chain. A third option known as Segwit2x failed to get consensus.

"Seriously, a lot of us still own BTC so we can understand why BTC is worth holding.

My problem is that we're still in investment mode (not in currency use mode) and as such, as difficult as it is, you are best to diversify.

In my case, I am switching to currency use mode just now and my personal experience this week is as follows:

1. Used BCH twice and got my screen stamped with ""PAID"" in 1 second each time.

2. Used BTC on BTC-only site and got a checkmark-successful in 1 second. There was also an option for paying with a lightning wallet and I took a screenshot where it stated you risk losing your funds if you use this option.

3. Used BTC on another BTC-only site and went through in a second or so.

The fact is fees went crazy with BTC for a long period at the end of 2017 and the solution to this is a risky Lightning solution that may or may not *eventually* be better than BCH KISS (keep it simple stupid).

So I still am diversified (even beyond BTC BCH) and hope that you are too.",1526093183
"So, the answer is yes. Thanks. See, I support improvements. That's what leads to solution. BCH claims to have found the ""solution"" which to me, means they just haven't ran into a problem they must disclose. Don't get me wrong, I support their vision as well, but it doesn't offer the flexibility of changing with adaptation and boasts it's platform based on its outreach.. Not computer science solely. I'm not the most well versed person on blockchain, but I really hope the solution is found in a solid way so crypto can thrive as a decentralized means of currency.",1526093087

"You don't understand what I meant by ""speculation.""  Speculation is not necessarily a bad thing, if it's done in a sensible way.

I see people on here and other forums going into debt to buy BTC, pouring their life's savings into alt coins in search of the next 100x coin, etc.  That is NOT a sound investment strategy because of the unmitigated and high risks involved, which are only amplified now by the attraction of scammers to get into the market in search of a quick exit after they collect from the ICO.

To me, ""investing"" is something you do with a fairly secure need in mind with a reasonably secure return down the road.  You invest in buying a house because you need a place to live and it's a place to store the wealth you would otherwise be blowing on rent.  You invest in a car because you need reliable transportation to allow you to function in society and commute to work.  You invest in CDs, mutual funds, or a private business because you are more likely to grow your money than not.  Etc.

I don't think BTC is going to fail anytime soon.  I wouldn't be here if I did.  However, it's not a given that it's going to even hold anywhere near the value it currently has, which was mostly ran up in a furious bubble beginning at the end of last year and then lost rapidly at the beginning of this year in the crash.   That has been the history of BTC since its inception and has only been amplified by more mainstream adoption.

Personally, I think that BTC is a transitional period in our technological evolution.  The idea of BTC has been revolutionary, but BTC, and even the blockchain itself, has fundamental problems that will limit its potential for future growth and adoption and eventually open the door for other cryptocurrenciess to steal its thunder.",1526092680

"&gt;Today's current low fees seem to be a result of those adaptations

Do you consider abandoning usage of Bitcoin as an adaptation? Nothing was fixed, people just stopped transacting. If the same rush of activity occurs, the same exponential increase in fees would occur. Excluding a small increase in Segwit usage, nothing has changed. 

&gt;willingness of network participants to pay a few dollars in fees

A few dollars in fees is outrageous though! This is Bitcoin, for Christ's sake. You've moved the goalposts into the parking lot to find a way to justify this madness. For a lot of those people, it was desperation, not willingness. Very few people were joyously paying those fees celebrating how secure and valuable the chain is, they were angry and betrayed, and investigating alternate cryptocurrencies or swearing off them altogether. They were businesses abandoning Bitcoin, customers clogging support systems, disappearing profit margins, etc. It wasn't a happy event, I don't care how you spin it. ",1526092586

"**Singular they**

Singular they is the use in English of the pronoun they or its inflected or derivative forms, them, their, theirs, and themselves (or themself), as an epicene (gender-neutral) singular pronoun. It typically occurs with an antecedent of indeterminate gender, as in sentences such as:

""Somebody left their umbrella in the office. Would they please collect it?""

""The patient should be told at the outset how much they will be required to pay.""

""But a journalist should not be forced to reveal their sources.""

The singular they had emerged by the 14th century. Though it is commonly employed in everyday English, it has been the target of criticism since the late 19th century.

Someone can come in with 4 dollars, buy 3 hotdogs and any future buyers must pay 3 dollars each. That one small ""trader"" tripled the price.

This is obviously an extreme example but that's why setting off extreme cascade effects in either direction is easy. Someone selling a large amount at once will snatch all the highest bids out leaving the next highest bid significantly lower.

Have you any specific ideas how one might apply fee speculation to increase channel profitablity?

Selling the coins and paying back the amount of money people lost when BTC was trading at few hundred bucks is nothing short of theft.

"&gt;That's straight from the troll handbook, lol.

How about you stop insulting me?

&gt;Who said the long term is not what matters?

You didn't, but I consider increasing infrastructure costs before efficiency boosts to be harmful in the long-run. 

It lowers the incentive to use the chain more efficiently because why not just raise the block size again instead? 

And it increases costs to people who want to use Bitcoin as trustlessly as possible, by running their own node. 

&gt;and there is no (non-troll) reason to assume BCH will not have 2nd layers or whatever is needed BEFORE they are needed.

I've seen lots of BCH supporters saying that scaling must be completely on-chain because it's a simpler user experience and is more transparent to have all transactions on-chain. It seems to me like the more prevalent ideology, but maybe it's not. 

&gt;Not letting people use the worlds new experimental currency without paying high fees so they have a horrible experience with it and they stop using it is what Banks wanted.

The awful experience is that it was slow and/or expensive. We can recover from that reputation blow because people understand that updates can make something cheaper and faster. 

What you can't really recover from with an update is security reputation, which in Bitcoin is linked to decentralization. If a single double-spend is successful (or something similar) it'll be a incredibly hard or impossible to ever recover the reputation of security. 

&gt;This is big business and you seem to be working for the banks or a corporation that thinks it can still make money off the damaged goods they stole from the people of the world.

Facebook started studying blockchain almost a year ago, when a member of its corporate development team, Morgan Beller, began looking at how the social platform could use the emerging technology.

At the time, Beller was the only Facebook employee devoted to studying blockchain, the digital and decentralized ledger that underpins cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Her work was thrust into the spotlight this week when Facebook announced that the vice president in charge of the Messenger app, David Marcus, would lead a new team to “explore how to best leverage blockchain across Facebook, starting from scratch.”

Marcus leads a team of less than a dozen Facebook employees working on blockchain. Before joining the company, he was the president of PayPal, which facilitates transactions between users in Facebook’s Messenger app.

Marcus is an early Bitcoin investor, and in December he joined the board of Coinbase.

No, like all small-blockers you seem to have a lot of trouble grasping *facts*. What I said was that no other team ever has or likely will ever introduce consensus changes to the **BTC block chain**. BCH had to introduce its changes to the BCH block chain. Are you with me now?

Again, you clearly cannot even grasp what people plainly say to you. There's not much I can do about this, but making it so apparent like this definitely hurts your credibility as a purportedly logical and objective commenter.  

&gt; All his arguments are incorrect....   

For the record, the author of the linked post is me.  

&gt; 1: this is still possible, miners just won't mine your tx....  

As I said, there's likely little or no hash rate getting pointed to pre-SegWit full BTC nodes. If there's even a minute amount, and the spender of a SegWit Anyone-Can-Spend transaction sends it with a reasonable fee and continues to broadcast it to the network, it will get mined eventually.  

&gt; 2: this is nothing new. It was always possible to push transactions on the blockchain that other participants can't verify.  

True that it's not new, and that's why I admit it may be Blockstream and Core's most successful deception to date. It's widely not recognized even among the on-chain scaling community, but it's clearly fact.  

But the second half of your statement is false on its face. Any miners operating under legacy rules (which should be entirely supported if SegWit were really a soft fork as claimed) would mine such a transaction without batting an eye, *because it's the more lenient rules that are still permitted before the supposed soft fork of SegWit*. When you say others won't verify them, that's the exact mechanism of a hard fork, and why SegWit is such a bald-faced lie.  

&gt; 3: segwit does not redefine what blocks are. It uses a side-channel to communicate additional block data.  

How can it define a side-channel without creating new rules, but only by further restricting existing rules, which is the *required restriction for a fork to be a soft fork*? Here, you are yourself here *confirming* that SegWit is really a disguised hard fork.  

&gt; If segwit is a hard fork, then so is every new protocol that uses OP_RETURN. I have one myself.  

That is quite possible. Real soft forks are highly restrictive, and you can't really do much with them. All prior ""soft forks"" that also used the Anyone-Can-Spend hack are also disguised hard forks (and were used likely as trial balloons to see how much the community was paying attention -- sadly we were asleep at the wheel for far too long).  

The fact is that the BTC block chain has experienced numerous hard forks. There's absolutely nothing calamitous about them (that's more Core and Blockstream propaganda), which has only been massively proven since the BCH hard fork by the plethora of essentially uneventful forks that have occurred not just in the cryptocurrency community, but specifically in the *Bitcoin* community since.",1526081799

2. 500 was an example since I don't wanna say exactly how much I buy or sell but let's say I buy $100 when my first buy condition is met, then if it drops another 3% I buy $200 more (double down) then if it drops another 3% I buy $300 more (double down again) next 3% drop is $600 (doubles down, 100+200+300) and finally the last double down the bot is slowed to make is for $1,200 

3. Smooth moving average is a basic investment indicator that averages the price movement and plots it in a smooth line, tradingview.com has some great visual representations of this available for free use. It’s just a way to plot data though.

4. DCA is dollar cost average, so in the #1 example if my bot bought 4x it would be the average price of all the $2,400 btc I bought where if I soled them all I would break even. ( although some were bought cheaper and some more expensive)

5. I start to sell when I am 2% positive over the average purchase price but instead of selling all $2,400 at a 2% profit I limit my bot to only sell $500 worth every 1800 seconds and to only continue to sell if the price increases 0.6% from that first 2% profitable price.

Then the card is used to buy crypto, under the fake identity, and the crypto is transfered to an untraceable destination. How will they recover their and their client's losses?

(Normally card purchases are traceable to a delivery address, or security footage, or to a digital service that can be canceled or reversed easily. It's the fact that transactions can't be reversed that is an issue for banking liability, mainly.) ",1526080781
"It goes without saying that miners can't simply drive up the price indefinitely. At some point, mining ceases to be profitable.

The point is, if you compare bitcoin mining to gold or oil production you are going to be mislead here. Increased gold mining or oil drilling increases the supply of the commodity which decreases the relative weight of demand causing downward pressure on the price. When oil producers ramp up production, for instance, the increased production causes a drop in the price of oil as now there is less scarcity and a greater supply of oil.

With bitcoin it is the opposite. Increased mining does not alter the supply, all it does is increase the number of people who are fighting over that fixed supply, which raises the price. In fact, the hashrate actually represents the price of bitcoin, denominated in proof of work, as set by the network. One need merely determine the cost per hash in USD and divide the block reward schedule to determine the base price in USD the network is selling bitcoin for. 

If the network is selling for a price that is actually even to what the market is selling for, that is what Fundstrat means by the ""break even"" point. It is the point at which buying from the network directly is just as expensive as buying on exchanges. Fundstrat is making the argument that as the price approaches the break even point, miners begin to reduce the amount of bitcoin they sell on exchanges, because what's the point of selling at the same price you just bought the item for \(and any decent miner will have robust rainy day funds for operational costs\). With next generation miners on the way, Fundstrat argues, miners will need to upgrade in order to remain competitive. But doing so will increase costs which will drive the ""break even"" price up.

"This community well pre-dates the August 1, 2017 hard fork that spawned Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and really is a refuge from the massive censorship and other pervasive unethical behavior that clamped down at /r/Bitcoin in August of 2015. As such, it's a forum for all things Bitcoin. The only problem is, over time BTC has grown to be quite un-Bitcoin, where as Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is obviously the existing crypto that's closest to the [white paper's](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin) design, intent, and which most closely follows the Nakamoto Consensus mechanism prescribed therein.  

So it's an accident of history really. BTC discussion is welcome here even now, and in particular if BTC ever becomes ""Bitcoin"" again, it would be truly embraced by this subreddit. Personally, I think it's much more likely that BCH will topple BTC first to completely reclaim the ""Bitcoin"" name (by the only measure that it doesn't already hold -- most cumulative Proof-of-Work).",1526080734

"&gt; I'm a Bitcoin Cash supporter, and even I don't think Bitcoin Cash is the BTC block chain. Strange. 

Bitcoin cash is an attempt to make consensus changes without from core, something you claimed can not happen.

&gt; This is just like having just Core, since none of the other implementations will ever set what this ""consensus"" will be. 

Seems we agree that it doesn't matter if there is one implementation or five.

&gt; This is an utter and complete lie, but arguably Blockstream and Core's most successful deception/propaganda to date. 

All his arguments are incorrect. 1: this is still possible, miners just won't mine your tx, but that's in full conformance with the old consensus rules. 2: this is nothing new. It was always possible to push transactions on the blockchain that other participants can't verify. 3: segwit does not redefine what blocks are. It uses a side-channel to communicate additional block data.

If segwit is a hard fork, then so is every new protocol that uses OP_RETURN. I have one myself.",1526080680

BCore influence is strong and those who support Bitcoin (Cash) are ridiculed and thrown out of the communities.

Well Multi-Sig is a good example.  Satoshi didn't write about it in the white paper but it's a damn good feature.

Awesome to have IBM doing an exclusive AMA on /r/btc! Very cool. ,1526079784
"I have to know:

1. Did you speak with that manager?

2. Did they deny you an account ?

3. Did you mention that your crypto speaking fee bill rate is $150/ hour. Minimum 1 hour. + $50 / 15 minutes thereafter. 
(Seriously you HAVE to charge them. You can accept account credit ) 

A few thoughts off head. Hashing required ;

I agree to a focus on KYC AML. And that your exchange also has your KYC info. 

*mention briefly the mining process , halving , transaction fees (they LOVE that term) Vs. block rewards. How they combine. “And when there are no block rewards transaction fees will keep the network running “ 

* the network can run with very few miners. One person with an old computer or ASIC. So it will remain very attractive to mine. 

*decentralization as redundancy , no single point of failure in the network. 

* focus on the fact that you are a tax paying citizen and that your accountant files proper taxes. That would would never knowingly or willfully participate in a crime of any kind. That you would report any you witness to the proper authorities 

* if you happen to be a miner and can use SMOS or other to show a miner in action that would be cool. 

* Cite your local crypto rules : ie. IRS has deemed this as property and is taxed as regular income at the time its received and then again at the time of spend. - long term vs short term capital gains. 

* mention that your transactions become part of the permanent, unalterable block chain. You cannot lie about or falsify them. 

* I would focus on Bitcoin but mention there are different coin types. Privacy coins, Erc-20, original bitcoin. 


Do Stay away from any securities talk. Like XRP

They are going to ask you questions that you cannot answer. Do not be embarrassed to say “I do not know that offhand. But I can check and get back to you.” — this is always better than lying. 

I am having mixed feeling on this next one: 
* bring up or at least be prepared to admit there are a lot of scams going’s on. 
*that 85% of ICOs fail quickly. And of those xxx% are not actual projects. 
* that you do not involve with ICOs or scams of any kind. 
(^assumption on my part) 

Watch some videos this weekend  and take bullet notes from several discussions. 

Remember your main objective is to get an account out of them. Be honest lying always come back to haunt you. Even if you’re a master. 

Second is to get a job ( assuming you want such )

Third is to get some sort of pay. Tell them you accept bitcoin (laughter guaranteed)

Report back with story !

"I didn't said that, I don't even know what you were scanning in? Was it like from your computer? I didn't get that part.

If I am not mistaken EXT type filesystems like on Linux are good, but those on Windows are not.

There are many factors too. However I'd say you already have a more secure setup than 99% of Bitcoin users, so no need to be extremely paranoid.

Most people still keep their coins in javascript based websites or mobile apps. There is no way to be worse than that.",1526079752
"I have a bit of insight into this.  NIST is on schedule to have post quantum cryptographic algorithm recommendations in about 8 years.  Quantum computers with enough power to attack ECC are 10 to 15 years away, depending on which expert you contact.

So yes, post quantum algorithms are known.  A company called [ISARA](https://www.isara.com/) already sells cryptographic libraries which are marketed as post-quantum secure (of course, because NIST hasn't given their blessing on any post quantum algorithm, there is no such thing as post-quantum certification).  Through my company, I've been given access to trial software of the ISARA IQR library, and it's very well done.  I've recommended the software to my management team, and I'd recommend it to any software developer who doesn't mind having to deal with proprietary software.

That said, my question isn't ""Do post-quantum algorithms exist.""  The question is how is Bitcoin going to deal in a post-quantum world.  Right now my private key goes through an ECC algorithm to generate a public key, which then is hashed (twice?) to generate an address.  If the public key is known to an attacker with a sufficiently powerful quantum computer, they can crack my private key and thus spend my bitcoins.

So at it's core, my private keys are unsafe in a post-quantum world if my public key is known.  Bitcoin will have to go through a major shift to protect private keys, public keys will no longer be able to be generated via ECC, **and all private keys which have known public keys must be emptied of funds or risk theft**.  The migration of funds from private keys seems like a serious endeavor.  So I'd like to know what the plans are for this migration.",1526079733
I don't think wildly swinging prices of crypto will let it be adopted for loans and stuff. I think OP should tell them banks that they should start their own crypto stable coins tied to fiat.,1526079732
"&gt; that's a strawman.

You just use double standards. You used the whitepaper test to claim that bitcoin cash is bitcoin, but you don't want to use the same test to conclude anything about litecoin. Why is that? Oh I know why, it's because the entire whitepaper test is nonsensical.

&gt; Litecoin is just a fork of the software. it has its own network and its own PoW it is not bitcoin. 

I don't know if these arguments are sufficient to claim that litecoin is not bitcoin, but these three arguments are definitely correct. Do you know which cryptocurrency also is a fork of the software, has it's own network and it's own PoW? Bitcoin cash.

(Yes bitcoin cash and bitcoin have their own PoW. Is is not possible to reuse work between the chains. You can use the same hardware, but you can also use litecoin mining hardware to mine bitcoin so that's not a valid argument.)

&gt; Bitcoin is a value exchange network. it is not defined by the software but by the participants who agree use it to change value. 

You stated in your last post that social consensus is irrelevant, and now you are stating the exact opposite.

You're confusing. Please state your arguments in a logically consistent way.",1526079668

A lot of coins are the result of a developer that just wants to print money to fund their creative project. People don't really understand that.

One of the major examples is Ethereum. Decentralized applications could run on the network, and the fees for the computing could be bitcoin. But... Then that would be no money printed to fund development.

Their whitepaper makes the case that its ""easier to use and access"" than other crypto. Which is absolutely not true. Coinbase is very easy to use, and by the way, buying ETN requires use of Coinbase or another fiat-crypto gateway.

"&gt; SegWit =/= SegWit2x. You're confusing the 2. The former was adopted by the network, the later was rejected by the network.

Flat lie, at lock in, the consensus agreement explicitly required the 2x block size limit increase hard fork to occur at a specified block height. Since that never happened, SegWit on BTC is illegitimate per Nakamoto Consensus from that block height on.  

&gt; 2x was a hardfork that never garnered 'massive miner support via Nakamoto consensus', that is precisely why it failed.  

In fact, it's the only reason that the farce that was SegWit2x ever got any support over about the 30% - 35% (never over 40%) miner support level. After adding the 2x requirement, total miner support peaked well over 90%, indicating the most important part of the agreement was the ""2x"" component **NOT** SegWit.

"I just going to cherry pick, because there is just way to much to comment on in this article. 

1. Bitcoin is far from an ideal currency and is only better than very few shitfiats (ehm.. VENEZUELA, ZIMBABWE) 
The definition of ideal currency is:
a, Fairly predictable (and stable) value - 
b, Liquid and used
c, Not manipulable by outsiders. 

a, I don't think I need to explain
b, Pick a random currency in the world, it is easier for me to buy a package milk with that than with bitcoin. 
c, here you could argue that everyone is outsider (non-trusted) and due to concentrated positions value can be easily manipulated by single actors - to be fair this is the hardest for currencies to fulfill

2.Systematic failures of the crypto ecosystem are   design flaws when integrated into the real world. It's like saying capitalism didn't cause the financial crisis MBDs and CDOs did.

"&gt;. And you don't need a network like a bank to make money by lending, that's what bonds are

You do entirely need a network like a bank to issue a bond. Or to buy gold. Or to invest in real estate. This is like explaining the sky isn't purple in financial terms.  A bank is intimately and crucial involved in every step of every financial transaction, although all you see is your brokerage. 

\-They are in charge of issuing the bond, and then they are in charge of the first sale of the bond \(the issuing bank underwrites/buys the bonds, flips them to the first round of investors. Eventually hits your brokerage\)

\-Banks \(or more properly, broker\-dealers\), are in charge of all large scale liquidity of gold futures \(you buy on your brokerage, they are contacting a DMM to buy for you, or a broker dealer, in both cases a bank or near bank\), and physical gold \(banks these days own majority of warehousing of gold, you buy a bar of gold, it's getting ultimately sourced from those warehouses\). Or, that gold mine that mined it? Capital via debt or equity raised by.... a bank.

\-Investing in real estate? If you mean buying a house, that means getting a mortgage from.... a bank. Buying a REIT? That means buying from a broker\-dealer, same situation of above. 

There is quite literally zero investment transactions, outside of micro\-lending nonsense, that are not directly influenced, or only came into existence because, by or of a bank. Aside from off\-exchange crypto, but guess what, that crypto \(these days\) likely touched a .....bank\-capitalized exchange. ",1526078146

Is it partly a social agreement? Absolutely. In the same way that the word 'elephant' is a social agreement. Why the word 'elephant' to refer to those giant grey animals with trunks and tusks? It's almost entirely arbitrary. But there are two ways in which the word 'elephant' is not simply a mass hallucination: A\) it refers to something real and B\) the word itself is suited to this purpose, unlike a word that, say, might take two minutes to completely pronounce. It would be difficult to claim that the word isn't, to some degree, arbitrary; but it would be equally difficult to claim that it is entirely arbitrary. 

Likewise with money. There is no doubt that the units and the currency are to some degree arbitrary. But money A\) represents value, which is real, and B\) has to be made out of some ""medium"" best suited to make money. For instance, apples don't make for a very good medium from which to make money, nor do numbers in a Word document.

The blockchain is a medium intrinsically better suited to make money out of than anything we've ever known. That's real. And as we continue to use this medium for money, that money continues to represent real value. That's also real.",1526076877

"Your assuming BTC is really 'the Idea/project known as Bitcoin'. False assumptions like that are what the troll army tricks people into believing. 

BCH supporters tactics are gentle compared to the corporate assault forces deployed by the Owners of BTC-core. The only reason BCH is doing anything remotely like what your talking about (if any of it is true) and the reason all the social media are a divisive mud-fest is people's attempts to DEFEND against the troll armies' ongoing repetitive attacks on any mention that Bitcoin is flawed or that another coin is better. Every thread is full of hate and lies spread by BTC-supporters (often pretending not to be). Most BCH supporters do not really care if BTC owners switch. Of course we do get satisfaction from it. Mostly, though, I want both coins $-value to approximate their true fundemental value to the world and for new people to know the truth so they don't lose their life savings investing in a coin that has intentionally damaged itself and temporarily keeps it's value up with lies and censorship.

BCH is currently the better coin. BTC could be fixed, but, Core says no to the known solutions so far. I'm not sure if they are trying to make a corporate-owned 2nd/3rd layer super profitable or if they are part of an attempt to destroy or delay crypto adoption while the Banks catch up with their versions of E-Money. Either way, BTC looks doomed to fulfill unimportant use cases and eventually collapse in value. BCH supporters don't need to try to get people to switch. BTC-core has destroyed their marketshare without any need for help from BCH. These days, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is 'the Idea/project known as Bitcoin' and that idea is still much better than what BTC is currently trying to do. BTC supporters get to call their coin Bitcoin for now due to the Bitcoin code. That is expected to change in time unless they fix their coin (Hard-fork to a much bigger block size?). For now, BTC supporters should be ashamed of their few controlling developers for selling out and should stop claiming (if they even do) that their project is still 'the Idea/project known as Bitcoin'.",1526076010

At that minor increase the difference to node owners should be negligible. They had no good reason not to implement 2mb blocks here, and they were expected to. And as we saw in December, a larger blocksize is sorely needed. 

What we can see here is the purposeful crippling of bitcoin so that they can offer a technology they can profit from. They’ve taken the adoption of Bitcoin (cash) years back in this move.

"I feel like as time goes on btc will emerge as more of a commodity investment, and become less volatile as a result. I see a large amont of wealth being ‘stored’ in btc for longer periods.

I see btc uniquely positioned because it doesn’t rely on any other fancy technology on top of it to solve its main use right now - store of value. All of these 2nd and 3rd gen cryptos still need to prove their viability to solve meaningful problems. Tech moves so fast that I could easily see many of the current 3rd gen cryptos falling by the wayside when new market demands emerge or new insight into inplementation shifts viability of existing platform capabilities. I don’t currently hold any btc but it’s quite elegant in the sense that it is more like a fundamental infastructure rather than a specific application of technology.

1) Walk them through the verification process of obtaining a new account on a well-known exchange. If you can, actually live-demo signing up for a new account.

2) Talk explicitly about how identify verification works in the enrollment process. Do some research in the help docs of well-reputed sites (like Coinbase) and use these documents as materials in your discussion. Consider going the extra mile and print out some of the documentation and publish it in a binder.

3) Close with a short discussion on tax liability and how exchanges report customers’ earnings to local governments. Of course many exchanges don’t do this, but only show examples which confirm this theme... “transparency”.


And that’s a wrap. If you do those things right and they offer you an account, ask them for a consulting gig 6 months down the road to help them figure out which exchanges they can trust and which are bogus!

I’d say, perhaps maybe more importantly, DON’T try to:

1) lecture them on the technological revolution of “the blockchain”

2) suggest that trading cryptocurrency is fundamentally different than trading any other asset

"&gt;It was abbreviated. I didn't realize abreviations were off limits. 

‘BCash’ is a derogatory ‘abbreviation’ meant to undermine the fact that Bitcoin Cash derives from the original Bitcoin protocol. There’s a video that explains the meaning in more detail if you care to educate yourself, I don’t have the link on hand but it’s out there.

&gt;Seems like a great community to be a part of if you think the same, smell the same, and wear the same clothes.

I like this sub because you have the ability to state your opinions (whether others agree/disagree) that allows for an open discussion.

I think many BCH adopters tend to be more familiar with the technical aspects (laid out in the white paper) of the Bitcoin protocol and that is what brought them to BCH, not the politics of who is who. Which is why most of the community tends to see eye to eye, not because of some fan boy mentality.

&gt;You all want mass adoption but when someone comes in with thoughts of their own and genuine curiosity you shit on them for having thoughts of their own.

From what I’ve seen, there is plenty of free thought on the r/btc sub. However, theres also malicious comments meant to mislead new adopters that may not understand the Bitcoin protocol and the reasoning behind the creation of the technology. A lot of new adopters only see Bitcoin as an investment, in which I don’t believe it was meant to be at all, the monetary gains are more of a byproduct.

When you make comments referring to BTC as the gold standard and other coins as the dollar, that leads me to believe that you haven’t read the SN white paper explaining the Bitcoin protocol. If you haven’t, I encourage you to do so as that may have an affect on your opinions as to what Bitcoin was meant to be.

I certainly believe that it is possible to have an alternative protocol that differs from the SN Bitcoin white paper and still functions as a digital currency, however such implementation would not be ‘Bitcoin’ and more of an alternative protocol (altcoin).

I think for those reasons you may feel that your opinions are being shat on, however, I think that it’s just the community basically rejecting that alternative narrative because this community wants to see the full implementation of the SN described Bitcoin protocol, not some alternative digital gold nonsense. There’s a reason why Bitcoin is what it is today (in both value and technology) and it has nothing to do with ‘hodling’ or being a “store of value”.",1526074843
"I looked into in, read the whitepaper, watched all the videos, read everything i possibly could about it and i have no idea how it works or what the main goal is.

mt gox, korea, china, japan, hacks, its all a smokescreen to cover up the fact that whales sell and keep buying back cheaper. can you imagine how much money they are making? they dont want the price to go higher. the only reason the price is going up is because there is a certain point where the whales inventory actually starts to get depleted. so in order for them to always have the upper hand and so no one can ever buy more than them they raise the price.

do you all realize that even with wall streets deep pockets, they can never ever have as many coins as the whales do. why you ask. because the whales will raise the prices to extreme levels if anyone tries to buy very very large amounts. which in part their reserves rise also. so they always will be ahead their lead is insurmountable. institutions know this and are hesitant to buy in because the whales can just pull the rug out and the price crashes and they collect all the fiat that the institution pumps in.

just like what just happened in dec/jan. price goes parabolic, whales sell, now you have a shit ton of people with coins and they are underwater and at the whales mercy. its dead money. whales are in no hurry to get prices up. they made their money and are happy as hell. people deep in the red, they can give two shits about them. they are locked in til people start buying and eventually will buy the current bagholders bags.

Thanks for posting your experience.  

Only Satoshi has done more for Bitcoin than Roger has.  He had the exact right background, and he found himself in the right place at the right time.  He grabbed the ball and ran with it.  I commend him.

&gt; Furthermore, I cannot understand why people are so keen to impugn Roger with the title, ""scammer.""

There is a large contingent of people who, if Bitcoin succeeds, stand to lose *a lot*.  They are the recipients of government redistribution, and the redistributors themselves.  These, and proponents of certain competing projects, are the people who are falsely maligning Roger.

"The paper describes why bitcoin works when you understand the why you can focus on the how. 

&gt;we proposed a peer-to-peer network using proof-of-work to record a public history of transactionsthat quickly becomes computationally impractical for an attacker to change if honest nodes control a majority of CPU power. 

To be a P2P node you need to work, to prove you are doing work you need to write blocks to the blockchain. It is this process that makes P2P cash viable.  

A node in teh paper does PoW, what Core call a node is not a full node. 

&gt;Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.

While the majority of people in bitcoin may think you need social consensus before you can use the Bitcoin consensus mechanism, they are wrong. 

Why Bitcoin works is described in the paper. The understanding you need is not. 

&gt;""The truth is incontrovertible. Malice may attack it, ignorance may deride it, but in the end, there it is."" 

if you believe the 1MB transaction limit is a needed rule, it would be useful to be able to articulate a reason why. 

If you dont understand the white paper, or think it is wrong, you are  in the company of those who would like to change it to reflect their understanding of how Bitcoin works. in that group are the ownrs of r/bitcoin and bitcoin.org. ",1526072605

"There are more coins than just BTC and ETH... The reality is that when ETH goes to PoS, some people will liquidate their GPU farms, and others will switch to other coins. 
 
Plus, there are plenty of coins that are anti-asic, and take steps to maintain that. Such as Monero.  
 
Bitmain has been announcing ASIC’s for several algos recently, including Cryptonight, Ethash, and Equihash. And the fallout has shown that a substantial number of miners don’t want ASIC’s around. (There are plenty who do, though). I don’t want to get into any debates about pro vs anti ASIC, because that’s a Ford/Chevy, or Coke/Pepsi debate. Ethereum announced that they weren’t keen on pursuing ASIC resistance, and Bitmain raised prices. Monero forked, other Cryptonight followed, and Baikal (who had developed a Cryptonight ASIC also) held a fire sale. (Plus, Bitmain created an ASIC-friendly fork of Monero as well. Obviously). 

With the latest announcement, the Z9 Equihash miner, the response has been a mixed bag. Several declares forking right away, others took a bit, while a couple declined to fork. The big daddy of Equihas, Zcash, has been wishy-washy, first declaring ASIC support, then a back-burner maybe later thing. 

Just because Nvidia says that the GPU rush may be winding down for now doesn’t mean that GPU mining is dead. This could be a lull in the action prior to another GPU rush.

I don’t have a crystal ball, so I can’t say what will happen with certainty, but I do believe that, as long as there’s PoW, there will be demand, and there will be an arms race between GPU vs ASIC’s. ",1526071591

If the average fee to be included within some number of reasonable blocks (say within the next 14 hours, which was fairly fast during the last jam up) is $50, this means the funds you're trying to protect from being taken (say by an open channel of $100 to a Cafe down the street) must be significantly higher or it makes no sense to spend the fee.

They can't have it both ways. Do they want consistently high fees or practical cost efficient transactions? With fees at a constant $50+ you've wiped out any channels below that cost, and probably any within a few hundred too (it makes no sense to fear a $50 fee to protect a channel investment of $200, just so it's possible to buy coffees with BTC) .",1526070895

"So I followed up to see your response, and look there, you deleted it. Your claims of being a wallet dev are however, forever immortalized in my quote of yours.

I would also like to point out that anyone can inspect the javascript code either in-browser after visiting the site, or via github, but that doesn't change the attack vector.

If you think it is reasonable for every person to inspect javascript elements prior to entering their password....well, obviously you would not be a rational person worth discussing anything with if you think thats reasonable.

The entire point of my original context was that a 3rd party can compromise the server and alter/inject malicious javascript that redirects both the wallet container *and* the password to a 3rd party.

Yes, **you** might be able to inspect the code and see whats going on, but the 99.999999999999999999999999% of users cannot or **will not** do so.

The point still stands. The best way to transact with bitcoin is through secure hardware devices that have little or no known attack vectors.

Even this is not trustless. You must trust the manufacturers, but at least you can build confidence that these devices are likely not compromised, or only compromised in highly unrealistic scenarios with physical access.

See my comment history there is a lot of complexity to how XMR Works and it is not just fully private. It is closer to bitcoin with mandatory single-use transactions, a small mixer [ringsize 7] and hidden amounts. It is a great tool. But one hard to use right.

Practical concerns exist too. All your wallet communication is unencrypted. Your ISP can monitor your transactions over time. Worse by default you will connect to a node then sync and transmit. This will often give away your true input to the node which negates the ringsignature.

For now best advice is to repeatedly send all your xmr [sweep_all] to yourself leaving a random amount of time between sends and keep doing it for a month or longer.",1526070440

"A good white paper should comprise of the following parts:

Project outline

Nailing your project outline is vitally important. It should clearly define exactly problem you intend to solve. Key to the project outline is to make it unique and catchy. It absolutely needs to stand out from the crowd and make investors want to read on. Given that the average investor will read hundreds if not thousands of whitepaper outlines every year, it is not difficult to see why most only get as far as the project outline.

The solution

This is the section where you need to make your project shine. The solution should include a thorough breakdown of your project, including a full project description, to show exactly how it solves the problem you just outlined. It needs to include detailed market analysis data to show exactly what the need for this solution is and how it fits into the preexisting marketplace.

Obviously, most companies will only have an outline or prototype of the project that they wish to undertake. In this case, you should include as many of the visual data or mockups that you have to help investors visualize your project.

A budget breakdown is a good way to reassure investors about how you intend to spend the money. This will help them evaluate your project plan as a whole and also convince them that your ICO is not a scam.

Roadmap

This will help give investors an idea of where you see the project heading and reinforce their confidence that you understand the marketplace that you are about to enter.

Again, making this section stand out is a must. Key to this is emphasizing the unique selling points of your project.

A detailed explanation regarding token release and marketplace considerations

In this section, you need to give a breakdown of your ICO token issue. This should include details regarding your crypto tokens, including their value, how many you intend to use, and which crypto token platform you intend to issue them. Another important point to include is how you intend to allow investors to redeem their tokens and details on what happens if your ICO doesn’t reach the funding targets it outlines (investor refund process).

This section should also include your terms and conditions or a link to your website where they can find them.

Finally, this section should also detail all the relevant security details that will help investors determine if your ICO is safe. Should you have chosen to employ a specialist security firm to launch your ICO, then you can also include information on their company.

Remember, no matter how attractive your ICO might seem to investors, no person on this planet is going to pay for digital tokens if they believe there is a good chance that the transaction is not secure.

Overview of entire team

Including the profiles of all the different team members really helps to increase both investor confidence and interest. Such is the market these days that the support of certain individuals from within the blockchain community can guarantee an ICO success. Though most ICOs don’t have the luxury of having the support of such individuals, investors now desire to see who is involved in the project and what their backgrounds are.

If any of your team has a background that includes a successful ICO launch then you should certainly include this information in this section. Remember, the key point here is to convince investors that your project has the passion and technical knowledge to succeed. If they believe it has then they will be happy to hand over their cash.

Without those ""greedy fucks"" the revolutionary potential will never be realized, and it is precisely because so many people are getting rich, and will continue to do so, from bitcoin that the revolutionary potential becomes almost inevitable.

Bitcoin is new money, and the primary role of money is to provide \(economic\) liquidity.

I contend that this group is very well funded.

"&gt; Why would fees be higher? 

The fees might be higher because you use more paths and therefore more nodes that you have to pay. It also might be cheaper, because one transaction is limited by the capacity of the nodes, so your routing options might be low, while with AMP you can more or less use any route, so you can pick the cheapest ones. So the question is whether multiple cheaper routes are more expensive in total than one route that is not cheap.

See the mailing list quotes:

&gt; Potential fee savings for larger payments, contingent on there being a super-linear component to routed fees. It's possible that with modifications to the fee schedule, it's actually *cheaper* to send payments over multiple flows rather than one giant flow.  
- Proposed benefit

---

&gt; I believe, currently, fees have not this super-linear component.  Indeed, the existence of per-hop fees (`fee_base_msat`) means, splitting the payment over multiple flows will be, very likely, more expensive, compared to using a single flow.  Tiny roundoffs in computing the proportional fees (`fee_proportional_millionths`) may make smaller flows give a slight fee advantage, but I think the multiplication of per-hop fees will dominate.  
- ZmnSCPxj

---

&gt; As Laolu pointed out, we have yet to see how fees evolve on mainnet or what will emerge as a sane, default fee schedules. I agree that if the same proportional fee is used across all partial payments, then it could certainly be more expensive. However, it could also be the case that you were paying a needlessly high proportional fee to begin with, because paths of sufficient capacity to the destination were scarce. In an AMP world, there will be an abundance of channels that can route small, partial payments, which may itself drive down the
competitive fee rate for smaller payments.  
- Conner

I think if you use LN for micro payments than even a tiny fee difference can become big over time. I'm thinking of internet of things (iot) and similar things where people could make hundreds or thousands of transactions.

&gt; A competitive fee market would still exist on chain.

Why? If there is always space I only need to pay the bare minimum a miner requires me to pay, correct?

&gt; BCH takes a haphazard and unnecessary approach to scaling

But what exactly is your problem? That miners can set their own block sizes? Judging from our ASIC discussion it seems like the mining part of bitcoin is already quite centralized. Not too centralized, but we are also far from ""everyone can mine, no problem"". How does increasing the theoretical block size make it more centralized?

"Legit advice: NANO and NULS.

NANO is the most promising project in the most valuable blockchain application (currency). I’ve been trading it since it bottomed and i gotta say whales are doing a great job at suppressing price and shaking people out. Now it’s a great buy (70-86sats) cuz they actually managed to push it back down very close to its bottom to re-accumulate. I wasn’t expecting to be able to buy more at these levels. Be grateful for this entry. Also, don’t fall for the fake FUD. Bitgrail hack is a bullish signal, just like BTC with MGox. Of all the coins out there, hackers went after this one. In no time, top currency projects like Bcash and LTC will get wiped out by this baby. BTC may not be threatened too soon, as it is still seen as “King”, but NANO may actually end up as the one. A 5x rally to its previous ath resistance its a no brainer. Although, would suggest keeping part of your bag for the long run.

NULS has much lower liquidity and trading volume than NANO, and its going under the radar for a bit. Unlike NANO, the best entry opportunities are now gone (~25sats), but this beauty has a lot of gas to run. Still under 150m mcap. Dollar cost avg by buying the dips. Expect a 10x increase in 1-2y.

"&gt; I agree with you that in a world where every single user has to run a full-node, full-nodes are probably quite a bit more inefficient than an LN node at processing the same number of transactions, but that world is not realistic 

Right, but his article wasn't really about that argument.  And that's more of a psychology/game theory argument, it's really really difficult to pull math out of that argument in the first place, which is why I'm not going to try. :P

&gt; I don't think the average person should or will run an always on server period. Which rules out both LN and Bitcoin Core's Utopia.

First Bitcoin's network effects need to be truly broken.  Until that happens, people may not have much of a choice, sadly.

&gt; As for the current LN routing algorithm: is there any formal proof that this routing algorithm will have even a modicum of probabilistic reliability or is this just a massive understudied hack?

This is a really hard question.  In general the answer is yes, pathfinding in self-healing networks works well.  But the possibility of an attacker to stall transactions for hours with almost no consequences changes that... a lot.  So does that make it an understudied hack or a reasonable attempt?  No idea.

&gt; I'm suspicious that this was opted for over the broadcast algorithm 

If you want to see why this was opted for over the Broadcast algorithm, watch Andreas' speech about delivery liberty at scale.  Andreas isn't even a tech guy, but he goes on and on about how the internet failed to stay properly decentralized but Bitcoin is going to.  He's talking about the BGP protocol routing debate that happened in the 90's.  Ultimately after years of a raging debate, the business-minded people delivering results won and converted the internet to a highly scalable but not perfectly decentralized routing algorithm.  Extremist nerds are, apparently, still upset about this today.  In the Bitcoin case, Bitcoin has successfully ejected a great many of the results-minded business people in the last round of this scaling war, leaving the extremist nerds behind and in control.  I don't know how that will play out in the future, just an observation.",1526064763

Haha. Beardman is popping champagne bottles every time bitcoin core becomes less useful as currency.,1526062740
"&gt; How do you see the math shaking down? Where is the error?

Going through it piece by piece.  Here's the first error:

&gt; &gt; If Alice’s path to Dave goes through Bob and Carol, there are actually 3 transactions that take place; Alice moving money to Bob, Bob moving it to Carol and Carol moving it to Dave. All three of these transactions change important data in the network map, and must be broadcast. 

When the money moves, there's no update to the network map.  So the one payment to Dave is 3 onion wrapped payments @ 255 bytes each and the success message, plus the commit transaction afterwards.  That's log(n) instead of broadcast(n)

&gt; &gt; This means that to execute a typical bitcoin transaction, around 1,000 to 5,000 messages of 255 bytes each need to be sent around the globe.  

This is not a very helpful way to look at the bandwidth consumption, and ultimately makes on-chain scaling look worse when you try to compare apples to apples (100k online nodes vs 100k LN nodes).  Since those two things aren't comparable, it's not the right way to look at the comparison.

Instead you need to break it down from the bandwidth perspective of a single user for a network with N users that each transact K times per year; 4m and 100 transactions/year is a good starting point I suggest.  I recommend looking at bandwidth consumption from the perspective of a pruned node (UTXO commitments, if we ever get them, will make this the reality for 99% of users), and assuming each transaction is relayed 10-20 times; This matches approximately what I've measured in the real world.  Average/median transaction sizes is ~500/250 bytes.

&gt; &gt; So now Bob, Bill, Ben, Beth, Becky and others all send out dozens of messages to their friends, and in this case, we’re in luck, Bob knows Carol, who knows Dave. 

Here you're already at 25 ""attempts"" per our other conversation.

&gt; &gt; That’s two more levels of separation, two more levels of messages back and forth, where each level grows exponentially in the number of messages that need to be sent and responded. 

That would be 125 and 625 attempts assuming 5 connections at each level.  I find it highly unlikely that any LN client is going to attempt a DFS payment 625 times without simply giving up and opening a self-healing new channel to the destination.  And if they did try that, it would be highly vulnerable to attackers stalling their transactions.  Again, you have to look at the bandwidth and actions from the perspective of a single user rather than trying to calculate bandwidth for hundreds of thousands of computers at once.  Even when attempting those DFS payments, it still only goes from hop to hop until it hits an error.  Then it stops and returns.  So it's `attempts` x log(N) x 255 bytes.

&gt; &gt; For a system of 100,000 users, which are all nodes in the Lightning Network, Alice’s channel opening transaction must be sent to all 100,000 users. 

For an on-chain transaction, every single transaction must be sent to all users.  Yes, SPV is more efficient, but SPV is a different security model and isn't widely used.  Even if people take their nodes offline when not in use, they still have to re-sync to the chaintip when they come back online.  That'll be better with UTXO commitments of course, but that just makes the math much more complicated.  In your article you're quoting 100,000 LN nodes and only 1000-5000 BTC nodes - BTC already has over 10,000 nodes today and that's just the listening-and-online node count.  The bytes of the transaction still count if they have to be sent to a node that comes online later and needs to sync them.

&gt; &gt; Now each channel needs to do about 20,000 transactions before we were better off just broadcasting an on-chain transaction on the bitcoin network.

I'm not sure where this came from other than from the wildly different ""1000-5000 btc nodes"" vs ""100k LN nodes"".

TBH, the math to compare the efficiency of these things is going to be extremely difficult, and definitely not something I'm going to tackle anytime soon.  There's far too many assumptions that go into the system.  In my opinion having a mix of ~99% nodes using UTXO commitments to quickly sync, plus ~90-95% of users using SPV clients to transact, plus a high dynamic blocksize, plus lightning transactions for the usecases it is appropriate for would be the most efficient solution.  But because LN transactions are not broadcast and BTC transactions are, an apples to apples comparison between them is going to give LN the better theoretical big-O performance.",1526062669

Unfortunately Alice gets arrested for buying drugs and she and her computer are brought into custody, and a subpoena is issued to Bob to publish a previous transaction and take Alice's Bitcoin, which he complies with.

"&gt; Ah, but it's effectively the only client as its the only that has ever or likely will ever make any consensus protocol changes on the SegWit BTC branch. That's what makes it uniquely identifying. 

People run bitcoin core because it represents their consensus rules. The consensus rules do not exist because of bitcoin core.

&gt; This is lip service and delusion on your part. If and when it happens, I'll admit I was wrong. But I expect the issue will outlast my lifetime. 

It already happened. It's called bitcoin cash.

&gt; Again lip service until any other team makes an independent consensus change that gets adopted by the community. Keep demonstrating your delusion, though. 

This is not different from bitcoin cash. There are ""multiple independent implementations"". But the reality is that all implementations must be in consensus with eachother. So what actually happens is that the consensus talk happens behind closed doors and that the market share of the clients is of little importance. Not that you can infer the market share of the clients from their node count, but that's a different problem.

&gt; The persistence of the usage of ""Bitcoin Core"" (or alternatives) to refer to the SegWit BTC branch clearly reflects the widespread notion that what SegWit BTC is now materially quite different from what was known as ""Bitcoin"" for its first 8.5 years of existence. Personally, I don't mind sticking with BCH and BTC to distinguish, but I understand where others are coming from on this. 

There is no such thing as ""the segwit branch"". Segwit is a soft fork and does not create branches. If you download an old version of bitcoin, before segwit was released, you'll see that it syncs with the current highest chain.

Maybe I should deploy segwit on bitcoin cash. Because it's a soft fork, there is nothing you can do to prevent me from doing this. Afterwards, I will try my best to rename Bitcoin cash to Segwit Cash.

So the more accurate way of thinking of bitcoin mining is that *miners are simply buyers of bitcoin who purchase directly from the network rather than through exchanges.* 

Put simply, more mining = more buying. And more buying = more demand.

"&gt; How would you react to me saying that it only got popular because Roger Ver owns a large part of the community sites and the Twitter handle,

Ver was actually somewhat slow to jump on BCH because of 2x, and BCH started without any input or support from Ver.  So I'd react by telling you that's misleading and false.

Ver also has a lot less power over BCH than Theymos has over bcore.  Further, the combination of Maxwell, Todd, Dashjr, and Corrallo have absolute veto power over any proposed changes to bcore.  Because Wuille, Wladamir, Back, Newberry, Timon and Morcos are unwilling to disagree with those four no matter what (and have basically stated as much), and no other contributors can possibly build enough support for a change without those people unless Theymos turns the community against bcore.  So you're following a coin whose entire future has been decided by four extremists as far back as 2013.

&gt; and Bitmain owns the majority of the hashing power, 

This is outright false.  [Antpool is only 10% of BCH mining in the last 7 days,](https://coin.dance/blocks) and Antpool has mined [50% more bcore blocks than BCH in the last 7 days.](https://coin.dance/blocks)

So you can claim whatever you want, you'll just be wrong.

&gt; and that BCash only exists because of the mining profits in it?

Considering that the majority of miners have supported a blocksize increase for the last 3 years, you'd still be wrong.  Before the segwit2x shitshow, BU had almost 50% more support than segwit did.  The original HK 2016 scaling round table was called because less than a month before bitcoin classic voting had 72% of the blocks signaling - The HK round table was a desperate attempt (and clearly successful) to derail Bitcoin Classic.  Naturally, no attendees from Core (other than Johnson Lau, who at least deserves some credit) even made **an attempt** to fulfill the agreement.

Every claim you've made here is just making you look more and more uninformed.

"OTC transactions are not recorded on a ledger so they do not affect the BID/ASK prices. These are private transactions where two parties consent on a price, and an exchange is made once person A pays person B and person B gives person A the product that was agreed upon. So no, dumping BTC on an OTC trade will not affect the price, because the exchange is held outside of the public markets. What the buyer does with the BTC could affect the price if, for example, he decides to go on an online exchange to sell his BTC and manipulate the price downwards. But i doubt an investor is retarded enough to buy 76m worth of cryptocurrencies, risk losing millions hoping to crash the price through a trailing sell order. There is also the possibility of the seller dumping his BTC on the OTC on multiple buyers so each won't have enough power to affect the market once they have acquired the BTC. ",1526057395

This is simply like doing a depth first search of a graph.  But it isn't a blind search - both the fee rates and the channel sizes on the network are likely to make it a lot better than that.  But it's not a straight N^2 broadcast by any means.  And it also isn't a flood, it is bound sequentially and it halts as soon as it finds a path, and also halts as soon as it finds a failed link (cutting off all of the paths going out from that node).  These things change the math - drastically.

&gt; This style of path finding is ridiculously inefficient without a network map, especially since a path might not even exist. 

Because these things are done sequentially and not instantly, while a human is waiting, they are very likely to have an attempt cutoff.  After enough tries, LN is simply going to (possibly after confirming with the user) open a new route on the network to complete the transaction.  That sucks for the users (when has Core ever cared about user experience?)  but it does make the graph better connected.  Again, these things change the math dramatically, particularly since there's now an upper limit on the DFS attempts and a self-healing aspect to the network.

&gt; The real downfall of LN is that everyone is responsible for their own path finding, so everyone is a ""full node"" in bitcoin terms. They all need a full set of information to be successful.

It sounds like you're making an argument in favor of smaller blocks.  I don't do that myself, but you can see how this logic would seem sound in the mind of a Core developer pushing smaller blocks.

&gt; With Bitcoin, only a small % of nodes need to be full nodes. Therefore, at full scale only a handful of people need to be on fast networks with unlimited data, massive storage, up to date computing power.

You're not wrong, but this is not a good selling point for BCH.  It sounds centralized.  In reality that ""small %"" can easily amount to hundreds of thousands of full nodes on every country, region and continent, but the way you've described it doesn't sound very appealing.

In my opinion after doing a lot of reading, the downfall of LN is going to be the inherently bad user experience causing low adoption, and the way an attacker can clog up the network.  But ""bad user experience"" isn't a certainty in the long run, and the clogging up the network isn't going to be particularly easy and may be somewhat costly.  A lot depends on how effectively the self-healing aspects can counteract attacker's clogs.",1526056362

Blockchain’s biggest event celebrates a year full of milestones.

What a year it has been. Since the last gathering of Consensus, widely considered to be blockchain’s largest event, bitcoin (BTC) hit $10,000 for the first time and then neared $20,000. Blockchain and cryptocurrencies captured the public’s imagination and faced new scrutiny from policymakers.

Most important, the embrace of the technology by the enterprise continues apace.

It’s the fourth year of Consensus. Despite a well-publicized boycott by the founders of Ethereum (ETH), omiseGo (OMG) and cardano (ADA), attendance during next week’s event is expected to top 4,500, up from an estimated 2,700 last year and up tenfold from the first Consensus in 2015.

These two scenarios don't take place at the same time. Right now we have that growth because adoption is low, and as a result it's terrible for lending. IFF we have full international adoption, then the price will be much more stable, and the only loans that won't happen anymore are the ones expected to produce below-average returns. 

Right now slightly below-average investments (less loss than inflation) are encouraged.

The value proposition Blockstream / Core pushed through, with coercion and censorship, is pretty much diametrically opposite opposite of what a boatload of people signed up for since 2010. Which is why, after years of struggle, the fork happened. The real reason the debate is so incredibly heated is that there is a good portion of ideology involved, which tends to bring out emotions in the debate. I don't know who will win out, so i hodl both. But my heart is definitely on the free market side. The token that provides most economic freedom will win the competition. ",1526054380

"Ill start at the more basic level by expanding on the value of blockchain. Do you know how many people have had land confiscated because someone comes in and says, ""I understand your family has been here for 200 years, but that guy John over there is the true owner. See, look at this piece of paper that shows what im saying is true, now get out.""

Blockchain, an immutable, distributed ledger, forces the underprivileged and elite alike to abide by the same rules because there is no way to spend an extra 100k and have some government officer do what you want by forging documents. Thats just one example. 

As for smart contracts, it allows the execution of transactions without the need for a middle man that makes things slower and more expensive, when contracts can be programmed depending on jurisdiction to allow peer to peer agreements/transactions that 100% fair and legal. It does the job of thousands upon thousands of lawyers and again it insures a level of fairness and limits advantages that can be taken. 

Blockchain and smart contracts automate and expedite a million different things. Often times its misapplied to cash in on the phenomenon, but it is truly revolutionary. We don't feel it now because to say its new is an understatement. Its akin to the invention of the internet, but how many years after its invention did we get google or even its predecessors? Things feel slow in crypto because they move so quickly and we wonder where the mass adoption is, but you cant introduce a brand new technology and expect mass adoption and ease of use within a year or two.

Basically, if you have two people who hold the same coin, but one bought the coin 3 years ago when it was 10 cents and another bought the coin 6 months ago when it was 10 dollars, the first person is *far less* incentivized to keep hodling when the market starts to dip. They are way up already, so it's just a matter of how big their profit margin is. The person who is newer to crypto has to hold their coins far longer in order to see any gains, and everyone else who bought in years ago, has to either continue to hodl, or sell their coins to new buyers willing to buy at the new price in order for the guy who bought 6 months ago to see any potential price rise action.

Basically, the longer a coin is held, the less important it is to continue to hold, assuming gradual gains.

Ask yourself: Blockstream have obviously told these investors _something_ to convince them that its plausible that Blockstream will be able to provide a (hefty) return on capital. What is this _something_? You are asking for sources. Its the _lack_ of evidence / sources of how their revenue model is intended to work that should have your bells ringing!

Considering the space they are operating in and the toxicity surrounding Blockstream it would have been _extremely_ prudent of them to be more transparent just what this _something_ they promised their investors really is all about.

For community I have been a part for a long time I find it _shocking_ that a _controversial for profit company with vaguely described motives_ have been able to gain such an influence over the protocol. Combine this influence with their undeclared and unknown revenue model and you have to quite naive to imagine that their choices / recommendations how bitcoin should evolve are unbiased and in bitcoins best interest. Its obvious that they will chisel out a path that fits with their revenue model, even if it somewhat gimps Bitcoin.

If this revenue model had been palatable for the community they would be transparent about it. They are going to fuck Bitcoin over, already has, to their own benefit. What ever you imagine Roger Ver has done is _nothing_ compared to the damage Blockstream has and is doing to Bitcoin.",1526053495
"I personally don't think BCH is the answer to scaling long term. But it only appeared because certain people behaved like complete cunts about using a practical scaling roadmap and basically pushed people into using altcoins. I still think BTC can recover from this stumble but these are self inflicted wounds. They should have agreed to a traditional blocksize increase from the getgo, not just segwit which took so long to implement that it gave ETH huge market share and also gave BCH massive market share. It would have worked better limiting the segwit size while bumping up the traditional blocksize and then gradually transitioning to segwit as services built support.

"This article is intended to be a translation of tech speak into layman's terms.

Bob, Bill, Ben, Beth and Becky are meant to signify all the direct channels that Alice has open (hence they all start with B).  All of Alice's routing has to go through one of those ""friends.""  

So she sends her message ""Does anyone have a connection with Dave?"" or as you put it ""Please make a conditional payment to ABCXYZT based on preimage hash R"" (where ABCXYZT is Dave) to all of her direct peers.  She can do this one by one and wait for a response as you noted.  But each message still needs to get sent, and once it fails, more and more messages must be sent until you get lucky and find a path.

This style of path finding is ridiculously inefficient without a network map, especially since a path might not even exist.  And the whole point of the article, is that maintaining a network map is, by itself, inefficient.  And it's inefficient whether you broadcast all transactions or just the opening and closing transactions.

The real downfall of LN is that everyone is responsible for their own path finding, so everyone is a ""full node"" in bitcoin terms.  They all need a full set of information to be successful.

With Bitcoin, only a small % of nodes need to be full nodes.  Therefore, at full scale only a handful of people need to be on fast networks with unlimited data, massive storage, up to date computing power.

"So you haven’t seen any examples either, just so we’re clear.

There are business models that blockstream could follow that don’t involve extracting rents off the bitcoin network users, like custom software development for others looking to make use of the free but general purpose, open source, most widely known blockchain, but without out the technical resources or expertise to develop their own. 

That’s potentially a HUGE market, and products like Elements seem to be a proof of concept example they’re working on, and the most likely business plan going forward. That doesn’t seem scary or misaligned with broad user interests to me, especially if they pave the way for sidechain development from others. It seems strongly aligned with seeing bitcoin become hugely successful, as i would imagine the stake of BTC held by the members of the company that likely dwarf their salaries does as well.

sentiment is RAPIDLY changing from bullish consensus to bearish now. people are starting to not expect much from it. whales are doing this for a reason.

If everyone expects a pump, who is buying to make it pump?
by making people sell now, whales can initiate a pump (despite what you think, it cost them a lot of money to raise it 10%) and then have all the idiots who fell for this FOMO in and make the pump even more extreme in the weeks after as they buy back in high. at this point whales begin to take profits and sell, and the cycle continues till the next event.

But the future is potentially long and who knows what will happen?

In 10-minute-block-time's defense:l 0-conf on Bitcoin Cash is reasonably good for smallish amounts of money. 

For larger amounts, waiting for sufficient confs is always a good idea even on a faster-block-time crypto.  Remember if you lower the block time, you decrease difficulty, thus each block is ""less of a security guarantee"" than before, because it took less hashrate to mine it.  So for large amounts of money you need to wait anyway.

That being said -- the future is long and anything can happen. Hopefully Bitcoin Cash gets to a point in terms of adoption and network effect where the 10-minute block time is the last remaining problem/challenge to be conquered!

"Ugh.

I'm getting tired of constantly repeating this, but people need to understand the truth about LN's flaws and benefits.  ***LN does not broadcast or maintain channel states in its network map.***

&gt; So, Alice just needs to look at the network map, ***find a route to Dave with at least $30 available in each connection,*** select that route, and boom, we’re done

This is not possible because Alice cannot know what any other channel's current states are.  They are not communicated anywhere in the protocol.

&gt; To maintain an up to date network map, every single transaction needs to be broadcast to every node in the network. 

No, this doesn't happen.  All that gets broadcast is fee level changes and on-chain opening/closing of channels.

&gt; If everyone chooses to keep their lightning transactions private how do you find any routes for payment?

You literally just guess at a route and see if it works.  If it doesn't, you pick another and try again.

&gt; “Do you have a channel with at least $30 with Dave.” So, Alice sends that message to Bob, Bill, Ben, Beth, Becky, and others in her network and waits to hear back. Guess what?  

This isn't how it works.  People need to do more research before posting things like this.  No offense - I used to be confused myself!  But this needs to be corrected/understood.  Alice doesn't send such a message to all those people, and in fact, there is no such message.  The only message that exists is an onion-wrapped ""Please make a conditional payment to ABCXYZT based on preimage hash R"" and then an onion-wrapped response ""Failed"" or ""succeeded.""

&gt; So now Bob, Bill, Ben, Beth, Becky and others all send out dozens of messages to their friends,

Again, doesn't happen.  Alice just has to keep trying to reach Dave herself.

&gt; But what happens as the system scales to 100 million users? Now initial channel availability and closure needs to be broadcast all 100 million users. That’s a lot of data. 

I'm not sure where you got this math from, but this is literally just how Bitcoin works.  If that math breaks down for LN broadcasting its open/closes, it'll also break down for Bitcoin with large blocks.

&gt; I haven’t seen anyone propose a routing system that doesn’t rely on a network map, 

Apparently you didn't understand how the network map worked...

&gt; Alice, recognizing that having a channel with a well-connected node will make things easier, connects with Binance. Alice still doesn’t have a path to Dave, but now she knows who to ask to find a path efficiently. 

LN might be changed in the future to delegate onion routing, but for now this isn't actually possible.  Nobody but you can route for you.

Again, I'm not a LN fan, and you can check my post history if you doubt me.  But people need to understand the reality of what LN can and can't do.  The things being described above aren't the problem.  The problem is, how many times does Alice have to fail before she succeeds in routing to Dave?  What percentage of coins are locked up to provide liquidity?  How much damage can attackers do without punishments, and how effective are punishments are deterring them?",1526051658

"If clients A, B and C agrees on the rules for block X, but client D has a different idea. Then nodes running D will split off to a new network starting at block X-1, as block X is rejected as invalid.

The worst case scenario would be that any potential split is quite equal, for example client A with close to 50% of the network and clients B, C and D with ~50% disagree instead. Then depending on what happens it could actually be two valid chains. But I think there's a very small risk of this, as it has been tested on the testnet.

""More servers"" == Decentralization. It literally is an added bonus!! LOL I can't believe you can bring up these issue when mining facilities are **physical** locations that can be compromised. Mining facilities have become so centralized that most of the hashpower is occurring in a very small number of locations. These are prime targets to be physically destroyed or sabotaged, by competing miners or those that want to censor bitcoin. 

On the other hand, Nano with a a PoS system has in essence digitized mining. This video is the Nano dev explaining this:

"&gt; Today's current low fees [...] $0.75 per kB.

A 1-in-2-out P2WPKH transaction is about 1/5 of a kilobyte, so at a price of about $9,000 per BTC, here's what my node estimates for fees for various expected confirmation periods:

    $ for i in 2 6 36 144 $(( 144 * 2 )) $(( 144 * 7 )) ; do echo -n ""$i blocks: "" ; bitcoin-cli estimatesmartfee $i | jq '.feerate / 5 * 9000' ; done
    2 blocks: 0.682776
    6 blocks: 0.23331599999999997
    36 blocks: 0.018000000000000002
    144 blocks: 0.018000000000000002
    288 blocks: 0.018000000000000002
    1008 blocks: 0.017964

&gt; $0.75 is certainly a lot for a African goat herder to buy something or to even fund his Lightning Network channel.

Indeed it is.  On the other hand, it's not clear to me how to solve that problem.  Let's say the fee for a typical transaction was 1/100th of a cent---cheap enough for the herder, I assume.  The typical person in the U.S. makes two transactions on average a day, so if all seven billion people were transacting at that rate using Bitcoin, that'd be fourteen billion transactions a day.  Total fees would therefore be, `14e9 * $0.0001 = $1,400,000.00`.  In other words, the cost to disrupt the world financial system would be on the order of a million dollars a day.

This, of course, ignores all the other problems related to increasing capacity to handle fourteen billion transactions a day on chain.

&gt; I thought the ""lower"" fees today are a result of less people using Bitcoin

That's probably partially correct, as peak fees corresponded with the most fervent part of the last hype cycle.  As the market activity has diminished, so has the number of transactions, but that doesn't necessarily mean people have moved away from Bitcoin.  It could just mean they're sitting on their bitcoins.

I think the confusion over this issue is emphasized by people who look at raw transaction counts rather than the number of outputs created.  It's [much more efficient](https://bitcointechtalk.com/saving-up-to-80-on-bitcoin-transaction-fees-by-batching-payments-4147ab7009fb) to send one transaction with multiple outputs (payments) than one transaction per payment, and many high-frequently spenders (such as Kraken) have adopted this technique and used it to save themselves or their customers fees.

&gt; What do you think of Bitcoin Cash?

I don't really think about it at all.  I sold all the bcash I owned a few days after the fork at the first opportunity I had.

&gt; So you enjoy high fees?

I don't enjoy spending money, but I do enjoy knowing that my fees help pay for the system that protects the rest of my money.",1526050179

I think it's best to plan for everything. Good or bad. Money can be made on either side. 

As far as singing the Sound of Silence  (lol, I love that Gob meme)... As long as you invest no more than you're willing to lose, then there shouldn't be any sadness or singing! I don't take crypto as seriously as others, I think. I'm really involved, but I also don't depend on it. This is more of a learning/hobby thing for me, and I hope many people treat it the same. If you're (not you specifically, I mean people) investing unreasonable amounts of money where it actually hurts you financially, then you're doing something wrong. ",1526050051

It's probably worthwhile to note particular idiosyncrasies between the genders like that. It's not that most women don't participate in Bitcoin, it's that they don't participate in the online forums and social media aspects, perhaps preferring meatspace interactions, instead. I've heard of more equitable (though still not 50-50) numbers between the genders when it comes to meetups, conventions, and the like.",1526050001

"You seem to be seeing some kind of complicated evil conspiracy. :)

It's very simple. You have some BCH address somewhere with an amount of BCH. Let's say you put 0.02 BCH. You provide this address to memo.cash. Your stake is now set at 0.02 BCH. You then post messages on memo.cash like you always do. It doesn't affect your stake. It doesn't cost you more than it does now. The only thing that happens is that the system knows your messages are connected with a stake of 0.02 BCH. The money remains yours to take anytime you want. Or you can add more funds if you like. 

Now you start reading some memo.cash conversation. You notice there's loads of troll posts. You see great comments getting down-voted by bots and BTC trolls. You then notice your stake slider is set very low at 0.0001 BCH. You set your slider a bit higher to 0.01 BCH. Suddenly all the troll posts disappear. **The troll down-votes disappear**. The conversation re-orders itself. You get a nice clean conversation. 

Now you could - **IF YOU WANT** - increase your slider further. You set it to all the way to 10BCH. You would now only see the highest stake messages. Loads of comments get filtered out. You get a clear view what the biggest BCH investors are saying. Some low stake comments are still visible if they were liked or commented on by higher stake messages. It's an interesting view to have. 

But I'm sure it's not what you will be setting it at all the time. You miss lots of interesting comments from lower stake people. So you set your slider lower again. The lower stake messages reappear. Exactly as you like it. 

So high stake conversations will only get priority for those people who set their stake slider high.

Next use case. Let's say there's some important protocol decision to be made for BCH. There may need to be votes. On Twitter this will go horribly wrong:

https://twitter.com/bitcoin/status/951827267042402305

I was on the sideline but I bought in here is why.... It's all about the number of users on a network. The Winklevoss twins use a great analogy...  If I am the only person with a cell phone it doesn't do much it has little value. But when someone else has one as well it instantly increases the value of not only my phone but yours exponentially. With that being said the MOST popular dApp so far has been Crypto Kitties with about 10k users at it's height.... 10 THOUSAND and that was on ETH ok... So now let's look at TRX. They have a deal with O Bike. O Bike is the LARGEST Bike share in the world. You know folks in Asia love them bikes and they are all over. O Bike will use the TRX network. O Bike has over 60 MILLION - yes that's right 60 MILLION users ALLREADY - so you wanna ride that O Bike... Guess what it will be on the TRX network as a dApp. Plus TRX announced that ANY ETH apps can convert over easily and it's free!!! Most of the hate and FUD seems to stem from the ETH crowd as they know their network can not scale and the TPS is slower. It's old tech. I was for a long time not a fan of TRX but as I have DYOR I have decided it's a good bet to take and at the price right now you can stack it and make some gains this year. And if Sun's recent tweets mean anything other than cryptic it could be a signal that Coinbase accpetance is coming along with that LONG rumored Alibaba partnership...

The advantage to this over say PayPal would be that since the fiat being used is transformed into crypto, run through the network, and then transformed into fiat on the other end, the fees are much less than going through the traditional banking system.

The problem with broadcasting any transactions in the LN to create a network map, is that it scales worse than bitcoin.  With bitcoin, data only needs to be sent between the full nodes.  For LN, everyone is a node and everyone needs data to find routes.  So even if you only send an opening transaction to the whole LN, when the LN is 100 million users, that's 100 million messages that need to be sent vs. ~5000 for an on chain bitcoin transaction.

"&gt;The issue I see with backing Bitcoin Cash over Bitcoin due to the above notion that BCH has more of a use case, is that a lot of people look at Bitcoin as a store of value, i.e. digital gold.  That property as a store of value has intrinsic worth without it needing to be used as a day-to-day currency for spending.

The problem is that I don't see that as a viable long-term path.  Consider the following:

Money as a tool for storing and transferring value can be compared to a bucket for storing and transferring water. Fiat, supposedly a good ""medium of exchange,"" is like a bucket that's easy to pour without spilling but that has a hole in the bottom, allowing water to leak out over time (inflation). Gold, supposedly a good ""store of value,"" is like a bucket that doesn't leak, but that's heavy and hard to pour without spilling (high transaction costs). But ""store of value"" and ""medium of exchange"" aren't really separate functions. The point of storing value is to eventually access it via a subsequent *exchange*. A bucket that didn't leak, but that spilled 95% of its water every time you tried to pour it would be essentially useless. And a medium of exchange wouldn't work if it couldn't do at least a reasonable job of storing its value between exchanges. It'd be like a bucket with no bottom (or a currency in hyperinflation). But the ideal monetary ""bucket,"" the one we should expect to ultimately outcompete all the others, is one that doesn't leak *or* spill. That's the potential that cryptocurrency offers. And that's why any crypto that sets out to be a high-friction ""digital gold"" will end up instead as ""digital lead.""

&gt;If you like Bitcoin Cash as it can be used more easily for day to day transactional purchases, I don't see why you wouldn't back a newer crypto project that is aimed at achieving this more efficiently. 

Just because the protocol of the majority chain was being badly mismanaged, that doesn't mean you need to zero out the ledger and start over. That would essentially defeat the purpose of money which is to *preserve* a record of value given but not yet received.

"Repost here in the comments:

Disclosure: Former member of the Komodo team. Wrote the Komodo white paper, based on the ideas of our lead developer, JL777. I left the team to finish my schooling, and remain an active Komodo supporter. I do not hold any Bitcoin (Core) nor Bitcoin (Cash).

This week, I'll be celebrating one year since I discovered the world of blockchain. It's quite a wild ride.

Being one-year old in crypto, I still feel like a newcomer when it comes to the history of Bitcoin. Like many, I'm fascinated by the story of Satoshi Nakamoto, the technology he initiated, and the advent of decentralization that followed suit.

We've all observed a lot of friction between the direction of the developers of the non-forked Bitcoin (Core), and the fork, Bitcoin Cash. The latter is claiming to be the ""real"" Bitcoin.

My experience in blockchain is still limited, though after eight months of working as a writer for the Komodo developers, I do have a much stronger understanding of this technology.

I'd like to offer a few thoughts, as I believe that much of the debate between Core/Cash is being run by people who have conflicts of interest (i.e. both sides of the debate stand to gain/lose a lot, depending on the outcome), and this is making it difficult for newcomers to gain a clearer perspective on what's really going on.

If you're not familiar with the debate between Bitcoin Core/Cash/etc., just start searching around online. I'm not going to link to anything I've read, because it all seems heavily biased. Often times it even seems to intend to confuse, or even obfuscate the truth.

By my observation, I don't know that it matters whether ""Bitcoin Core"" or ""Bitcoin Cash"" is the ""real"" Bitcoin.

The term ""real"" to me conjures up all kinds of existentialist debate. How do we define ""reality,"" and what does it mean to something to be ""real""? Those are arbitrary definitions that ultimately go nowhere, for our purposes.

Also, seeing as how the originator of ""Bitcoin"" appears to have left us, the name ""Bitcoin"" is just a name that we give to a particular popular cryptocurrency. That's really about it.

The real debate that many people seem to be having is, which one is more valuable (not just in terms of fiat, but also in terms of future usefulness)?

This is a much more meaningful debate, by my observation.

While I was working for Komodo, we were constantly asked ""What gives Komodo its value?""

Our lead developer's constant response is the best one I've heard anyone come up with: ""Usage.""

At its simplest level, what gives any currency value is the ability to use it. The end.

In that sense, Bitcoin (Core) and Bitcoin (Cash) are both doing quite well.

Bitcoin (Cash) appears, to me, to be trying to stay true to the original vision of Satoshi Nakamoto. Whether or not the developer's team are doing it successfully is up to the users to decide.

Bitcoin (Core) appears, to me, to be trying to adapt Bitcoin to be more accessible to the users of the existing system (fiat/USD/EUR/etc.).

There's value in both approaches, and I personally would guess that both will continue to grow in relative fiat value, so long as the growth of miners supporting both coins continues.

Now, having said all of that, I also want to state that I've had the good fortune of meeting Roger Ver in-person, and the personal attacks on his character put forth by many in the cryptocurrency community do not presently hold any weight with me.

I spent a few hours talking to him and to members of his staff at the Anarchapulco event in Mexico this last February.

I saw nothing but honesty, integrity, and a desire to advance the cause of decentralization.

Furthermore, I cannot understand why people are so keen to impugn Roger with the title, ""scammer.""

Why in the world would someone who owns as much Bitcoin (Core), who got into the movement so early, be motivated to risk destroying his character for more money? Wouldn't it be easier, as so many others have done, to simply hold Bitcoin quietly? I doubt the financial gains would be all that different.

By my observation, the incentive motivating him to push forward with Bitcoin Cash is a commitment to the underlying ideals, rather than the pursuit of money.

I do personally believe that the people who are trying to damage his character are doing so out of a desire to see Bitcoin (Cash) fail, as opposed there being an actual concern.

&gt; Bitcoin Core is the reference implementation of the bitcoin system, meaning that it is the authoritative reference on how each part of the technology should be implemented.

Bitcoin ABC is not a reference implementation.  BCH doesn't have a reference implementation.  Fully 1/3 of BCH nodes are Bitcoin Unlimited.   There are at least two other development teams with full node implementations who participate in active protocol development.  There is not a permissions owner for the protocol, as there is in BTC.

"Not sure why the post was removed.  Here is the original post:

""Disclosure: Former member of the Komodo team. Wrote the Komodo white paper, based on the ideas of our lead developer, JL777. I left the team to finish my schooling, and remain an active Komodo supporter. I do not hold any Bitcoin (Core) nor Bitcoin (Cash).

This week, I'll be celebrating one year since I discovered the world of blockchain. It's quite a wild ride.

Being one-year old in crypto, I still feel like a newcomer when it comes to the history of Bitcoin. Like many, I'm fascinated by the story of Satoshi Nakamoto, the technology he initiated, and the advent of decentralization that followed suit.

We've all observed a lot of friction between the direction of the developers of the non-forked Bitcoin (Core), and the fork, Bitcoin Cash. The latter is claiming to be the ""real"" Bitcoin.

My experience in blockchain is still limited, though after eight months of working as a writer for the Komodo developers, I do have a much stronger understanding of this technology.

I'd like to offer a few thoughts, as I believe that much of the debate between Core/Cash is being run by people who have conflicts of interest (i.e. both sides of the debate stand to gain/lose a lot, depending on the outcome), and this is making it difficult for newcomers to gain a clearer perspective on what's really going on.

If you're not familiar with the debate between Bitcoin Core/Cash/etc., just start searching around online. I'm not going to link to anything I've read, because it all seems heavily biased. Often times it even seems to intend to confuse, or even obfuscate the truth.

By my observation, I don't know that it matters whether ""Bitcoin Core"" or ""Bitcoin Cash"" is the ""real"" Bitcoin.

The term ""real"" to me conjures up all kinds of existentialist debate. How do we define ""reality,"" and what does it mean to something to be ""real""? Those are arbitrary definitions that ultimately go nowhere, for our purposes.

Also, seeing as how the originator of ""Bitcoin"" appears to have left us, the name ""Bitcoin"" is just a name that we give to a particular popular cryptocurrency. That's really about it.

The real debate that many people seem to be having is, which one is more valuable (not just in terms of fiat, but also in terms of future usefulness)?

This is a much more meaningful debate, by my observation.

While I was working for Komodo, we were constantly asked ""What gives Komodo its value?""

Our lead developer's constant response is the best one I've heard anyone come up with: ""Usage.""

At its simplest level, what gives any currency value is the ability to use it. The end.

In that sense, Bitcoin (Core) and Bitcoin (Cash) are both doing quite well.

Bitcoin (Cash) appears, to me, to be trying to stay true to the original vision of Satoshi Nakamoto. Whether or not the developer's team are doing it successfully is up to the users to decide.

Bitcoin (Core) appears, to me, to be trying to adapt Bitcoin to be more accessible to the users of the existing system (fiat/USD/EUR/etc.).

There's value in both approaches, and I personally would guess that both will continue to grow in relative fiat value, so long as the growth of miners supporting both coins continues.

Now, having said all of that, I also want to state that I've had the good fortune of meeting Roger Ver in-person, and the personal attacks on his character put forth by many in the cryptocurrency community do not presently hold any weight with me.

I spent a few hours talking to him and to members of his staff at the Anarchapulco event in Mexico this last February.

I saw nothing but honesty, integrity, and a desire to advance the cause of decentralization.

Furthermore, I cannot understand why people are so keen to impugn Roger with the title, ""scammer.""

Why in the world would someone who owns as much Bitcoin (Core), who got into the movement so early, be motivated to risk destroying his character for more money? Wouldn't it be easier, as so many others have done, to simply hold Bitcoin quietly? I doubt the financial gains would be all that different.

By my observation, the incentive motivating him to push forward with Bitcoin Cash is a commitment to the underlying ideals, rather than the pursuit of money.

I do personally believe that the people who are trying to damage his character are doing so out of a desire to see Bitcoin (Cash) fail, as opposed there being an actual concern.

Best of luck, dear reader, in your blockchain endeavors.""",1526046825

"&gt;It's not bitcoin core. It's just bitcoin. The other is bitcoin cash, no parentheses. 

Eh, nothing ""IS"" anything when it comes to language. Language, not unlike crypto itself, is a decentralized protocol that's highly dependent on the network effect but that is capable of ""forking."" If you want to argue that those calling the BTC chain ""Bitcoin Core"" (rather than simply ""Bitcoin"") currently find themselves on a linguistic minority branch, you're probably right. But sometimes the linguistic minority eventually becomes the linguistic majority. 

It'd be nice if more people declaring this chain or the other to be ""the real Bitcoin"" could be more explicit about what definition they're using and provide support for why they think that definition is reasonable.  And also to be clear when they're speaking descriptively (""this is how people *are* using these terms"") vs. prescriptively (""this is how people *should* use these terms"").  Some have suggested that ""Bitcoin"" be defined as something like the most-worked / economically-dominant chain that traces its history back to the Satoshi genesis block. That's not an unreasonable definition in my view. And using that definition, Bitcoin Cash might be thought of as simply a candidate chain to *become* ""Bitcoin."" Alternatively, one might argue that Bitcoin Cash will *prove to have always been* ""Bitcoin"" when it surpasses the BTC chain by defining ""Bitcoin"" as the chain that ultimately emerges as the most-worked chain (if they're confident in such an outcome).  Others might define ""Bitcoin"" as the most-worked chain extending back to the Satoshi genesis block *that preserves what they see as Bitcoin's essential character as a low-friction (fast, cheap, reliable) electronic cash system*.  By that definition, I'd consider BCH to be ""Bitcoin.""  Still others might consider ""Bitcoin"" to be a general umbrella term that describes all ""Bitcoin"" chains collectively. According to that view, referring to *either* BTC or Bitcoin Cash as ""Bitcoin"" sans modifiers is at best sloppy, and at worst, incorrect or misleading.  ",1526045937

Bitcoin cash is bitcoin because it adheres to the original structure and operational design for Bitcoin described by Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin Core no longer does.

A non-mining node cannot enforce anything. *It can only watch.*

Imagine the US Federal Reserve decides to fork Bitcoin and change the block reward to create inflation.

They invest in an ASIC fab and build ASICs until they have more than 50% of the network hash. They don't spin up even a single non-mining node.

There are 500 billion non-mining nodes still running on the old code. Every person on the planet spun up 100 non-mining nodes to fight it.

First they mine the original chain to increase the difficulty to double. Then they implement their rule changes with their 60% hash power all mining on the new rules.

Nobody can stop them, because they have the majority hash power.

The 500 billion non-mining nodes all reject the blocks with the new rules. The Fed keeps mining and making the chain longer and longer.

All the nodes running the old code are now forked off the network. They are waiting for new blocks that they deem to be valid, that never come. And the difficulty is too high for the 40% of hashpower left to find a block.

The rules have been changed. The non-mining nodes did NOTHING. They had absolutely no effect at all.

Bitcoin with LN/L2 will never reach the critical network effect of demand required to be a functional transactional medium. Instead of calling me a fucking idiot, set a remind me. When in any time in life I'm required to use bitcoin instead of fiat, feel free to rub it in my face.

Simply fund your Google channel with $5 or $10 and automatically update the channel state every time you watch a video. Add to that in-app/in-game purchases where small transactions are repeated with a single party. These limited use cases don’t need routing solutions because they’re single hop, don’t destroy bitcoin’s economic incentives because they’re a niche case, and don’t get into AML/KYC territory. For these use cases, I can’t wait to see the Lightning Network on Bitcoin Cash!

"I can agree that trying to get into a debate over which cryptocurrency is ""the real bitcoin"" is fraught with conflicts of interest, and Ver has probably stepped in some of that. I think it would be impossible not to, given both his and the ""core"" team's objective.


Imho, both and neither are ""the real bitcoin."" It doesn't really matter. It's just a name. What really matters is your ability to access and use the value that you hold. 


I can see why Roger is trying to have Bitcoin Cash claim the title, ""the real Bitcoin."" There are philosophical pros and cons to that route. Names do have value, and the word ""Bitcoin"" is likely to last for centuries. Personally, I just don't care enough about ""who owns the name"" to think that there's something sinful in either team's routes. 


The idea that the Bitcoin (Core) team is still offering the same product to users that Satoshi Nakamoto promised simply appears to be incorrect. Segwit does appear to change the nature of the coin beyond its original scope. There's nothing wrong with that! But if the nature of the coin changes, I see nothing wrong with suggesting that the name of the coin might deserve to change as well--or, that the ownership of the name can be called into question.",1526044547
"Lol sounds like the people talking about Bitcoin on Bloomberg don't understand the first thing about it. If they did they would not make such a carless mistake.

Good lesson to learn",1526044518
"Ay cant none y’all step to this, chillin with a 40 in my hand I’m the best at this, run up on me in 5 years time, empty the clip on you got bitcoin on my mind

Bitch",1526044505
It's just normal crypto activity. People forget why they got in and become spoiled with infinite gains so this is just to weed out the weak hands,1526044471
"BTC has made me a millionaire.

And within a decade, probably billionaire",1526044440
"&gt;  It's deceptive to try and trick people into buying an Altcoin by calling it the name of the main coin

""**THE MAIN COIN**""

*double facepalm*

He just breezes right over the entire debate. They forked. They took identical base code and BCH made updates that were in line with what Bitcoin was supposed to be doing before it was essentially sieged in a hostile takeover by blockstream.  

The *only* objective measure that the BTC we trade today shares with the original Bitcoin is that it got to keep the original exchange ticker. I hardly think that justifies calling it the ""Main Coin"". 
",1526044415
"The infusion that pushed BTC up to $20,000 and crashed has still left us in a hangover.

The media's mostly moved on, since a bump from $6000 to $9900 looks like chump change after that.  A lot of the people who came in over $10k were left with a bad taste in their mouths, too, and all the FUD from Buffet, Gates, and others doesn't help.

Until the Wall Street exchanges open up, ETH shoots ahead of BTC, or BTC rises back to the $20k mark again, it's going to be a little slow.  We'll see if next week's conference sparks some interest, but that news will mostly only reach the converted.

In the meantime, stock up!  Buyer's market now.",1526044407
This shows crypto is becoming super mainstream. This post will prolly get downvoted since it has ripple in the title though,1526044366
"I dont get this.

Roger Ver owns some bitcoin cash therefore bitcoin cash is scam.

Im sure there are a lot of scammers, murderers, who own a lot of bitcoin. Is bitcoin a scam?

what if Antonopoulos turns out he's a murderer? Would bitcoin be a scam?",1526044361
"The last thing you’d want on your Burger King bitcoin is Korean FUD, but as it turns out at might be what you gæet",1526044354
"There are illogical miners of Bitcoin. This is sometimes the case in the oil business. Yes, you could liquidate your company, lay everyone off, and buy oil off the spot market, but then you lost your company, and its hard to find all those people to restart it, if prices change, and you have sunk costs, etc. People just act illogically, its an entire field of economics. I recycle aluminum cans, even though its a waste of my time, compared to any job, or even begging on the side of the road. Why do I do it ? Good feels, man, saving the Earth, and all that. Its 'cooler' to mine than to just buy from a whale...",1526044321
Are you able to bitcoin mining using a mobile device?,1526044311
Whether or not it was mt gox or not...today we all found out bitcoin is a freaking whimp at this point.,1526044247
isnt this version of Bitcoin forked too,1526044221
I think you misunderstood.  This is referencing that it now supports BTC.  They've supported those ERC20 tokens for a bit of time now.,1526044218
"Opening a channel is a on\-chain Transaction. In you example, it would have a 1 BTC input from the exchange and 0 BTC from the noob. 

Sending the 1 BTC to the noob is done off\-chain by updating the channel close transaction. The noob can then leave the 1 BTC in the channel, send it elsewhere \*\*using the channel he has with the exchange\*\* or simply close the channel to use it in regular on\-chain transactions.",1526044193
So is Bitcoin a million now?,1526044069
"Right.

That still doesn't change the trustless Proof of Work security model.

A non-mining node contributes as much to Bitcoin security as someone reading a book has control over the words on the page.",1526044062
"I wasn't arguing the POINT of crypto. You're going off on a tangent. Robinhood is a TRADING PLATFORM. They do not claim to be a hot wallet. 
So again: it doesn't matter",1526044060
"lol wut? BCH is at 16% of btc price which is barely below the top of the initial run up still..

If anything I'd say this is one of the last buying opportunities of '18",1526044053
"They are very anti Bitcoin (Cash) over here, idiots if you ask me. ",1526044037
"Good points.


So, again, I don't hold either. 


Whenever I hear people say ""store of wealth,"" I always feel a bit skeptical.


If Bitcoin (core or cash or whatever) were a store of wealth, then I would assume that if I put a certain amount of value in there it will still be stored there when I return.


However, much to the favor of those who got in early, when Bitcoin (whatever) users return to their ""store,"" they find a completely new amount of wealth. Usually it's a good thing, though for some it's not.


For this reason, I don't buy into the ""store of wealth"" philosophy.


I do observe that buying early and hodling for a long time is likely going to be quite profitable, for any of these coins.


As for Bitcoin Cash vs Ethereum, there's a few things that separate Bitcoin Cash from the latter.


Take a look at bitinfocharts.com:


https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/hashrate-btc-eth-bch.html


What you are looking at is hash rate. It took me many months of studying blockchain as a writer for Komodo to understand the value of what this is.


Hash rate is what protects a pure PoW system from manipulation/attacks.


It is the basis of decentralization in its purest form.


Other forms of consensus mechanisms typically sacrifice security and decentralization so as to obtain other benefits (cheaper, lighter environmental footprint, etc.). 


We have yet to see a consensus mechanism that maintains or improves upon the level of decentralization &amp;&amp; security that Satoshi Nakamoto invented.


Segwit, which Bitcoin (Core) now champions, sacrifices several forms of security. Alas, I do not understand this part thoroughly. I've only had developers (not just from Komodo) explain to me in what might as well be Greek why Segwit is bad for decentralization. 


Note that I didn't say ""Segwit is bad."" I just said that I hear that Segwit is bad for decentralization. There are complaints that there are now methods available to rescind transactions, and that the lightning network was neither necessary nor a superior direction to go in.


I really don't know, and like I said, I don't have a horse in this race.


What I observe as an outside is that when Bitcoin (Cash) took a step back to the time before Segwit, they were stepping back to a stage where the ability to further the cause of decentralization was stronger. And that's a good enough reason for a bunch of people who believe in decentralization to go that route.


Therefore, buying Bitcoin Cash is an investment in gaining purchasing power (i.e. ""usage"") among a world of people who are enthusiastic about decentralization. 


Ethereum's hash rate is very, very small in comparison to the two hash rate giants. It doesn't even show up on the charts. Also, I hear that VB is going to switch Ethereum to PoS, which is a step down in terms of blockchain security. I don't believe, as many others do, that Ethereum is too disbursed to ever allow a coordinating party to gain a 51% majority stake ownership.


The same can be said of many of the other coins. Nearly all sacrifice decentralization and/or security in an attempt to carve out a niche for themselves. Those that don't, and instead try to compete head-to-head against Bitcoin Core/Cash, find themselves competing against a network effect. Presently, it's simply more profitable to mine Bitcoin Core, or to speculate just a tiny bit and/or adhere to the ideal of decentralization, and mine Bitcoin Cash. For this reason, other coins just don't have the underlying value that the two PoW giants offer.


I do suspect that both coins will continue to grow. The ultimate effects of the fork probably won't be known for up to a decade. ",1526044009
"Just another troll, good luck with trolling strangers on the internet (you idiot). 

Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin, Blockstream hijacked the original vision to try and make it into a settlement layer instead of digital cash. ",1526043998
"Miner is rewarded 12.5 BTC \+ 1\-3 BTC in fees in coinbase block reward , they than transfer this BTC to exchange with an onchain btc tx . The can either use this tx to directly load the BTC into a LN channel or tx some in LN and leave some with a regular address \(yes this can be done with a single onchain tx\) or allow the exchange to load the 13.5\-15.5 BTC into a channel.

Either way :

1\) There will always be demand for onchain txs even though most txs will happen offchain or other L2 

2\) The end user doesn't even need to worry about really high onchain tx fees in the future . For now they are a mere few pennies , but lets assume btc gets really busy  a few years into the future and the fee market creates 10 dollar fees onchain as a hypothetical. That fee will be covered across the whole \~14 BTC the miner loads to a LN channel , thus a user buying 0.1 BTC from an exchange would have a fee of 1/140 of 10 USD or 7 US pennies for that purchase",1526043942
"Spend your crypto, try it!

Heres whats going to happen:

&gt;no I dont accept SHT

&gt;No we dont take SHT

&gt;Bitcoin? How do I accept bitcoin? Only an email? Okayy(free transaction through coinbase)

&gt;*swipes shift card*, register lady doesnt know

&gt;Can I give you 50$ in BTC for the hotel, okay, coinbase good? okay.

Once you realize this problem is solved, you will wake up. ",1526043885
"I'm still not getting your walled off internet point. Distributed ledger technology has more uses besides just crypto, and banks will find ways to use it internally.

Yeah, I would probably consider coinbase a bank kinda like I would paypal. They are a 3rd party holding and controlling assets that don't belong to them on behalf of depositors.

IDK about legally, but it's definitely a form of banking.

&gt;Also, you’re wrong, decentralized exchanges are coming. And you don’t need a bank or even a coinbase to support it.

Really, so if I had $100k worth of BTC and wanted to sell it on a decentralized exchange into USD, how exactly would that be accomplished without any bank being involved? Is someone going hand deliver a box of cash to complete my transaction?

I suspect they will have to wire transfer funds through the banking system.",1526043873
"I'm not asking if you personally think they are Bitcoin. I'm asking if you think that an exchange should have the right to label them Bitcoin?

And if the answer is no, then why should bitcoin.com have the right to call bitcoin cash ""bitcoin""?",1526043793
"Buy the dips people, there's a huge sale going on in crypto right now.  The train will b leaving the station very soon.  Don't be standing on the platform when it does.﻿

",1526043754
"History of the world.

Politicians and groups fracture when they get big, people do power-plays. 

For instance, if someone does something I dont like- I call everyone in my political movement to take sides against that person. As a result, Ive gained political power. People listen when I call them.

This was me being selfish/greedy, but I still did it. 

You bet thats going on in Crypto.",1526043752
Any Bitcoin theft should be execution,1526043722
Both coins forked. BTC soft forked. BCH hard forked. ,1526043710
Btc is outdated and useless,1526043699
8200 BTC is less than 1% of the 24 hr volume lol people need to educate themselves about the daily BTC volume and see that 8k btc is a drop in a river,1526043688

"The fact that you will now be able to accept BTC with Request Network is such a huge milestone - Now you will be able to easily implement and accept payments in BTC, ETH and ERC20 tokens (REQ, OMG, KNC, DGX &amp; DAI will be the first one being supported)

",1526043609
"I fully expect to be downvoted into oblivion in this subreddit (assuming I'm not too late to the party).  With that being said....

Bitcoin is never going to lose its throne as the #1 cryptocurrency.  It's pretty easy to get caught up in small internet communities and become convinced that their coin/token does something so revolutionary that they stand no chance of failing.  I think many people in r/cc are victims of this trap, hence the shameless shilling that goes on here.

[Metcalfe's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law) states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of its users.  BTC has the largest and most diverse group of users/platforms/services, and quite frankly, nothing else besides Ethereum is even close.  ""But BTC transaction fees are too high! The network can never handle the weight of the entire world!""  The truth here is that no coin is existence can do this securely right now.  I know that's a tough pill for most of you to swallow, but consider this: BTC capacity could increase by 1000x, and it still wouldn't be able to handle all of the worlds transactions.  So to all of you saying ""yeah, but Xcoin is so much more efficient!"" I ask, is it thousands of times more efficient and is it proven secure?  The truth is blockchain as a technology is inherently not efficient because of its need to preserve decentralization and security.  Scaling technologies are coming to BTC and other coins, but we're simply not there yet. But I commend the BTC community for withstanding attacks from Ver and Bitmain, which inevitably would have destroyed its decentralization.

I think some platform apps will survive, but to be honest, the world doesn't need decentralized apps nearly as much as it needs decentralized money.  Central banks are a scourge on this planet, and crypto represents the first opportunity since the invention of fiat currency to break free of these shackles.  The banking industry is a behemoth, and people seem to have forgotten that taking those guys down is the ultimate prize in crypto.  Bitcoin is the only coin dedicated to this cause since it inception and its lack of a clear leader/coordinator will only help its cause.",1526043607

"Again, you won't care about volatility if you want to use BCH as a *currency*, protecting you from inflation. If you're in it for speculation, then you care. To use it as an anti-inflation hedge just buy a set amount every day over the year, whatever % of your income you're comfortable with. Example, if you want to put in $1K per year that's about $2.75 per day or $19 per week. 

Anyone doing this with Bitcoin year over year, in pretty much any year will be ahead the following year, often way, way ahead. However, most people think and look short-term. That's natural.",1526043575
Mt Gox sold 8200 BTC. That is causing more selling by other people.,1526043561

At the latest peak of fees a few months ago, many high-frequency spenders began adopting [best practices](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Techniques_to_reduce_transaction_fees) that allowed them to pay lower fees and increased the capacity available to everyone else on the network.  Today's current low fees seem to be a result of those adaptations.  With development of Lightning Network proceeding nicely, it looks like the next generation of spenders will also have the ability to adopt higher-efficiency payment methods to reduce the impact of future fee increases.

On top of that, I think the demonstrated willingness of network participants to pay a few dollars in fees per payment a few months ago bodes well for the future health of the network as the block subsidy is steadily reduced.",1526041458

&gt;In finance, a short sale (also known as a short, shorting, or going short) is the sale of an asset (securities or other financial instrument) that the seller does not own. The seller effects such a sale by borrowing the asset in order to deliver it to the buyer. Subsequently, the resulting short position is ""covered"" when the seller repurchases the asset in a market transaction and delivers the purchased asset to the lender to replace the quantity initially borrowed. In the event of an interim price decline, the short seller will profit, since the cost of (re)purchase will be less than the proceeds received upon the initial (short) sale. Conversely, the short position will result in a loss if the price of a shorted instrument rises prior to repurchase.

"&gt; why would a token that already exists and has a price, increase in value?

That really depends on the token, and it's difficult to make blanket replies given the wide varieties of token roles and incentives that exist, but I'll do my best.

To take your ETH example, think of its value having two layers.  The first layer is what you might call the transactional value.  It's the value of money that currently runs through the ETH network to power what ETH does. Everything from launching ICOs to crypto kitties to moving your money on and off exchanges.  If every single speculator stopped investing in ETH, and the ecosystem was valued at exactly the amount of work it was doing, then that would be the ""base rate"" value of ETH. It's also basically the ""minimum"" price of ETH.

The second layer is the speculative layer, and that basically comes down to people trying to anticipate what ETH's transactional value will be in future. ETH might be valued at 4x its transactional value, but if you think ETHs transactional value is going to be 10x what it is now come 2019, then that's actually a good deal.  Not just because ETH will be worth 10x as much in a fundamental sense, but because future speculators will push the price even higher than that.  That's why ETH can do things like go from $1000 to $400. The transactional value doesn't change, but the speculative value varies wildly on top of it as the market gains and loses confidence.

Which leads nicely to your other question, which seems to be ""if a token is just running in the background how does it gain value?"".  Think of a utility token that requires that ""If you want to benefit from the work our network does you are required to do it in the form of our token"".  Use the LINK token as an example.  If you want to pay a Chainlink node (or nodes) to fetch you off-chain data in a trustless way, you have to use the LINK token for that payment.  So as the number of people seeking to use that service increases, demand for LINK tokens increases.

 Simple supply and demand. Greater demand for tokens (which are divisible into so many decimal places you don't actually have to pay more for the service) with a fixed supply leads to an increase in price as the network gains greater use. But here we're still just talking about transactional value. There will always be a speculative layer on top of that. So if you see Chainlink tokens are worth $0.50 but you think demand for trustless data feeds and payment triggers is going to be so great that they will be worth more, then you will pay more. And so will the next guy. And so on and so on.  

So there will always be an exchange based market for speculation on tokens, but what speculation boils down to is anticipating future increases in transactional value that will drive further speculation.  Anticipating growing transactional value is exactly why crypto is NOT a ponzi.  If you're invested in the right coins then you should make gains *even if everybody stopped speculating on them* simply because in a growing network with a fixed supply, demand will organically drive an increased token price,.",1526040870

"Even if BCC HF in a solution for transaction malleability they have three problems using and adopting LN scaling solutions

1\) The whole ethos of bcash is to always have low onchain tx fees  regardless of other scaling solutions and to keep HF blocksize increases  to insure this happens therefore there will never be any motivation to  do the hardwork of building LN on BCC

2\) Because many of the LN solutions are dependent upon aspects like  segwit , RBF and the codebase keeps diverging between BTC and BCC it  will become increasingly more difficult to copy the work from LN  implementations without creating bugs

3\) One key aspect of LN securely is users being able to run their own  full nodes or watch towers which will become very hard to do if Bcash  keeps increasing their blocksize limit",1526038707

the obligatory Crypto Kittie comment ,1526038286
"I thought there was no 1 wallet that belongs to Satoshi. The 1 million BTC figure is rough estimate of all the blocks he might have mined by himself in the very early days. From my brief exploring of the first few thousand blocks, the block rewards have not been consolidated. The reward for each block is just lying there untouched.",1526038207
"Look at the weekly chart before you panic sell lol. The past 5 weeks has had a significant amount of buy volume, this dip doesn't mean shit. Bitcoin needs healthy growth and corrections, not insane runs and crashes.",1526038193
"No. In futures market, shorting is a contract in which you agree to sell at a certain price. No bitcoin is being sold when shorting.

In margin trading, money is being borrowed from the broker. No bitcoin is being sold when you margin trade and 'short'.

Only way to really short is to sell your Bitcoin if you have any.

Quite the contrary to what you think, when there are record amount of shorts vs. longs is usually a time when the price pumps, not crashes.",1526038181
"Ok.  So how would that work then?

Let's play a mind exercise.  Let's assume BTC has gained full international adoption.  You get paid in BTC.  You get 10 BTC per year salary.  Everything around you is price in BTC, and likewise the price does not fluctuate based on fiat conversion regardless if up or down.  

How would that work when BTC is deflationary?  Mining will eventually stop producing coins, if not already there in this scenario.  People will lose their private keys.  People will die and nobody knows their key.  The circulation will decrease, and thus value MUST go up.  Which means your salary goes down yearly, not up.  The price of houses, cars, and coffee must go down, not up.  So every year you are increasingly less able to repay that 57 BTC loan anyhow.",1526038156
"I mean this fud is at least a real event that is happening, most of the time before it was just complete fabrications. That said upbit is not a big enough player in btc/eth volume to warrant this. They are mainly a trx/eos/bcash exchange.",1526038092

You've really got that wrong.

I'm not Price obsessed, I'm technology obsessed.",1526037932
"Yeah yeah yeah, but that’s only tangentially related to BCH. Why waste time on what BS does? 

Of course they’re trying to make money - there’s nothing wrong with that. Bitcoin users who don’t like how they do it will move (or have moved) on to other currencies. 

Money making isn’t antithetical to Bitcoin. Proprietary solutions either. You can “appropriate” as much as you want - ultimately as it gets over the top, users leave. 

By the way, crypto exchanges are all proprietary tech that glues different cryptos (and often fiat) together. Why should I care? If they save me $X and take 40% of that, that’s okay by me.",1526037886

"Not really... All these clients appear to have agreed upon a name for the branch of the bitcoin blockchain upon which they operate, “Cash”. The Core team has not, so it is convenient to just use their repo’s name. Others have suggested Bitcoin SegWit or Bitcoin Legacy. These work, too.  ",1526037711

"You're right, the only reason bitcoin isn't already the global transactional medium is because everyone is a fucking idiot and you're a fucking genius.

I agree with you that BCH and other fast-and-cheap-tx alts have their value as *exactly* that.

But the *true* value in cryptocurrency is decentralized and uncensorable. We already have fast and cheap (for users) with paypal and credit cards, today.

"I never said supply was an issue — I said the idea of something being finite. There are many things finite and infinite — neither predicates value or lack of value. Diamonds are not finite, but they have a lot of value.

Would it?? Why? It is governed by a body that sees value in its value rising. But it is in a controlled way based off of multiple factors.

True — and some people also invested heavily in Google around then as well. 

And that’s great to hear, and I would agree to an extent. I own multiple as well, and I can definitely see this space having a handful of main options (like 3-4 specializing in certain fields) but most will be losers. 

With that said I think it is dangerous to say that some of those losers can’t be called early and I think it is harmful to the ecosystem to support them as true options (thus my long winded rant against Bitcoin). If you had brought up Stellar or Cardano, I probably wouldn’t have dove in that much/ at all. Bitcoin is great for what it *was*. Continuing to support it will engender a bubble — which you are right in saying — will hurt the whole crypto community.

I would rather cut ties with deprecated technology and focus on technology that actually has purpose. Not just say the whole thing is a crap shoot — that’s how bubbles and recessions happen. Carefully choosing winners and losers leads to a strong, steadily growing economy.

No, you're misunderstanding. My entire point relates tot he moral failings of these people. Ad hominems are only fallacies if they are asides from the point your attempting to argue and serve only to appeal to the emotion of the crowd.

My whole point is that people with poor moral standing are embraced by the community as leaders, particularly Roger. For a short while a few months back it seemed like the community was starting to turn on Roger a bit but I no longer see that. Instead everything that he tweets is parroted endlessly on here and he is in control of many resources that he allocates to propaganda, which he publishes under the Bitcoin name.

Uh no. I didn't say that BCH didn't have 'many' dev teams. Go back and read.

Sounds like Iranians are buying bitcoin to store value and move funds out of Iran.  Bitcoin could become the crisis currency. ,1526033094
"Now I'm gonna play devil's advocate to your playing devil's advocate.

Because ""we don't need 1000 tokens"" doesn't only apply at the level of the individual customer, but also on the level of businesses. Why should the market leaders in smart contracts let a huge hidden ecosystem of business2business service providers siphon off their profits?  Most profits that come from services which can be provided by a focused team of developers on their own (without creating an independent, large and profitable end user market) will eventually be consolidated in the hands of a few big players in the end user market, because these players have all the market power. Like Google doesn't pay an independent start-up to provide them the Maps service. And Apple doesn't let an independent ecosystem run its app store and collect fees from it. Why should they? It's much more profitable and comes with better network effects to provide this on their own.

Likewise, in your scenario, the market leader in smart contracts could be the very same company that also runs the most popular dapp base layer, dex, cryptocurrency and crypto-fiat bridge. Why should *they* use 1000 tokens to satisfy their end user?",1526033067
"I've considered suicide every day for the last 10 years or so. If I didn't have people depending on me i'd probably have done it by now. I'm also too much of a coward.

Its probably a bad idea. You can always turn things around and learn from your mistakes. I'm not sure how much you've lost, but i'm about $60,000 in the hole on my trading alone, but this shit always goes up. Just wait for it to go back to your buy\-in price and get the fuck out of it. If you bought into shitcoins, sell them into bitcoin and wait for it to go back up. Sell out and stay out. 

Reconsider",1526033010
"I use crypto for lack of sleep, lack of productivity at work, losing strong family bonds and never seeing my friends. You?",1526032971
"its all speculation, if you think bitcoin is overvalued it is highly likely ETH is too, and you could make the argument that eth is more overvalued because it has no hard cap.  

also, Usefulness does not always correlate with price, ETH can be useful at $100, why not $50?

That is of course if we are actually looking at ETH like it is the one that will survive, we have no idea, it could very well be the netscape of crypto.",1526032938
"So Bitcoin doesn’t have that ETH has:

1) strong Smart Contract system supporting 
2) a strong development community backing it
3) a number of DAPP supporting tens of thousands of customers all paying usage fees in ETH
4) a strong governance protocol to resolve looming issues

What bitcoin does have that ETH doesn’t have:

1) transaction costs that are so high it is impractical as currency
2) a potential 51% attack because of the centralized ASIC concentration
3) a developing energy crisis because the miners burn so much mining for coin
4) a looking hyper inflation problem. If bitcoin drops enough, it will never recover because there is no mechanism to “bring the currency back in”

So yeah I mean the signs are subtle, but you know they are there",1526032838
"Just checked and upbit is still trading normally.  Pretty much guaranteed to be fud.  Time to ignore my crypto Holdings again. I wish I could sell, but the second I sell will be the very second this is announced as fake news and the mt gox selloff will be halted until 2023....",1526032787
"from my observations it also takes alts longer to start becoming green than btc. because money migrates usd btc alts. until we see an uplift in btc, i don't expect alts to become green :/ as much as it saddens me",1526032746
"I wonder about this a lot too. What proportion of the BTC supply has been lost forever? Would it be wrong if there was a mechanism put in place to somehow re-create lost bitcoin so that the circulating supply would remain 21 million? 

But I suppose there’s no way to know whether any given private key is truly lost, or simply hasn’t been used yet.",1526032694

"I know it's not a perfect product showcase, but I'm quite new to video making and editing. Watched few tutorials online and started. 

The camera I used is Sony A6000 which I borrowed from a friend. I've used two type of lens for this one, a close-up, and the pancake lens. Recorded it in the daylight for better light, but the mistake here is that I had no tripod, so it was all recorded in hand and turned out a bit shaky, which I tried to fix in post-production.

Anyway, feedback is welcome. If there are any experienced videographers here, please feel free to chime in. It's far from those corporate product showcases.

I'm not, I'm simply pointing out that the project is being frontrun by Roger, CSW and Jihan. This is not a fact that can be ignored. Three immoral characters are orchestrating a lot of what's going on with BCH.

&gt;You just can't help yourself to just ad-homming certain individuals in place of any actual arguments against BCH itself can you. None of these people are Bitcoin Cash, only businessmen who use it, and can do that because BCH requires no permission from anyone and they can do as they like for better or worse.

Again, you're completely missing the point. Did you read the comment I responded to? I'm pointing out very obvious reasons that people are skeptical to get involved. I can talk about the tech if you want but this is not at all the point I'm trying to make here. There's also nothing ad-hom about this, bro. My *entire point* is that these people have shown bad character flaws and are poisoning the project to the degree that this community doesn't hold them to account. You clearly don't understand what ad-homs are.

&gt;There is zero empirical or practical research out there I've ever seen in 4 years to back up those claims. ZERO. Or are you going to pull out that retarded ""if every man, woman, and child cannot run a node on their cell phone its centralized!"" shit argument? Satoshi understood econonomies of scale and even said he expected the network to distill into specialty datacenters which would eat full 32mb blocks like it was nothing, and well beyond. You obviously know next to nothing about IT and how trivial that data load really is.

Lol, not even going dignify this over-the-top vitriol with a response but *I know that you know* that what you're saying is not true.

&gt;BCH has several developer teams, not just one, (ABC, BU, XT, Bitprim, Parity, etc), but I'm sure you knew that. Far more than BTC's basically centralized Core team to where no other implementation has any say whatsoever in the protocol.

Bitcoin has more teams than just Core as well.

&gt;Easily since most of what comes out of your troll hole is total bullshit.

Right, because you've definitely proved that.

"Ok, so why not post that article first?

Also: A memorandum of understanding (MOU orMoU) is a formal agreement between two or more parties. Companies and organizations can use MOUs to establish official partnerships. MOUs are not legally binding but they carry a degree of seriousness and mutual respect, stronger than a gentlemen's agreement

So this is still far from a legally binding partnership. But still super awesome for ICX.

"Valid concern. I’m all about decentralization and free speech but since most people do not yet fully understand the use cases of a blockchain and it’s power to undermine the current financial infrastructure. You have to ask yourself: How convenient would it be for a country to start pushing a ‘cp/terrorism/stealing intellectual property/etc’ narrative to get mining/use of blockchain technology banned, or even just blacklist a certain crypto currency at least?

I like memo and blockpress a lot, I’m just not sure  it’s a smart move to actively start putting “questionable”  content in the chain just to prove a point.",1526031830
Except it wouldn't matter what project you were in today. As bitcoin goes so goes the nation.,1526031783
"I am not in the US or knowledgeable about their tax laws... but the answer is surely: It depends?

If your cost basis of the coins you own is low, say $6k/bitcoin and you sell at $9k then you've made a gain of $3k per coin that's taxable.

If you then re-buy down at $8k then you'll have more bitcoin than you did before, however you do now owe tax on the sale. Your new buy price of bitcoin is $8k and you'd be due to pay tax again if it goes up and you sell.

If you take $12k as the target sell price for both scenarios (2x) then in option A) where you buy at $6k and sell at $12k, you owe tax on $6k when you sell. Taking 1 BTC as the nominal, that's whatever % tax on $6k.

In option B where you buy at $6k, sell at $9k buy at $8k and sell at $12k you owe tax on $3k + $4k = $7k. But you made $1k more so you still come out ahead.

Of course what most people forget is that you have to factor in when you want to pay tax. If you don't want to sell crypto to pay the tax (e.g. you want to still hold your bitcoin after you sell at $9k and rebuy at $8k) then you need enough money in the bank to pay the tax man at the end of the tax year that's not from crypto...",1526031779

"&gt;BCH is promoted in a fraudulent way by Roger and his employees. By referring to BCH as ""Bitcoin,"" he is misleading people to buy something other than what is most often referred to by this term, which is BTC.

You just can't help yourself to just ad\-homming certain individuals in place of any actual arguments against BCH itself can you. None of these people are Bitcoin Cash, only businessmen who use it, and can do that because BCH requires no permission from anyone and they can do as they like for better or worse.

&gt;  BCH is naturally more prone to centralization and attacks than BTC because it has less hashing power, a larger block limit \(though in reality much smaller blocks\) and its development team is smaller and less diverse. \(among other reasons\) 

There is *zero* empirical or practical research out there I've ever seen in 4 years to back up those claims. *ZERO.* Or are you going to pull out that retarded ""if every man, woman, and child cannot run a node on their cell phone its centralized!"" shit argument?

I agree. 

My point is you are too early. Bitcoin is being adopted. EOS isn't. EOS is being speculated with. And Bitcoin, because of ICO madness, is probably overpriced too. 


You are too early. There is a reason Cryptographers are highest in demand, since Cryptography exists. People aren't there. 

Are you going to use EOS to make the world a better place and create a bunch of smart contracts? No. Neither will I. So who will? 


Eventually more technical people, that can use that shit. 


However, we're not there. 


We barely manage to get use Bitcoin. 



Not to mention that the level of investors in Crypto is simply ... unreal. Since for the first time ever in human history, everybody is now investor, is not a good thing, because these things also happen. 


I'm not here on Reddit and think to myself ""oh what a thoughtful comment from the community"". Have you read the shit your peers write sometimes? 


Garbage, FUD, if it's critique. Doesn't work mate. It simply doesn't. 


&gt; I would feel confident that Iota will get some adoption too but I expect that large companies will roll their own Iota network so it won't actually raise the value of a miota.


IOTA is currently a useless project. It might eventually be good. The valuation it currently has, it simply does not deserve it. 


&gt; I will say that plenty of the tokens have a chance albeit a very slim one because they are trying to disrupt big industries but it is far too early to say how successful they will be.


I argue it's irrelevant how good the projects currently are, because all are overvalued still. Cardano in my opinion is great, but are they worth as much as SpaceX right now? I doubt it.

Anyone all over the world could contribute to this ""Venezuelan Bitcoin fund"" in charge of distributing bitcoin in Venezuela. Remember, you don't need to give btc to every single one here, nor change all the bolivares to btc. Just spark the ecosystem. Venezuela could become the example of an actual country running on btc and this will raise the price as it will prove you can use it as a currency.

Now, I don't think a massive donation it's necessary (although it will surely speed things up) as btc is better than bolivares (as dollars is better than bolivares) so people will naturally seek them. I believe you mainly need more easy to understand wallets (even if there's a middle man) to make it easier for people to buy some bitcoin (even if they are just buying a few satoshi). I think that's the main issue, getting the average Joe (the average Jose on this case) to use it on a daily basis.

So I set an 'stop' order for 95 cents to sell to tether. Ripple can correct to 80 cents, but the stop will trigger and I will have 95 dollars worth of tether.

Do you believe that it is the governments fault that the country has such problems? Do you agree with the American sanctions, I believe their plan is to stop the oil income funding the government, which 30% of comes from US. If this is the case I see Bitcoin almost as a sanction imposed by the people.

"Ok, I realize that the English news article doesn't have all details known so far. See the Google translated version of the Korean news below, and note that the exchange is accused of trading crypto coins without actually holding them in its wallet:

""Prosecutors have searched for a bit of a virtual currency exchange for the first time in Korea on charges of fraud.

The second part of the financial investigation of the southern Seoul District Prosecutor's Office \(Inspector Jeong Tae\-jung\) sent the inspectors and investigators to the head office of Gwangnam\-gu, Gangnam\-gu, Seoul on the previous day and 11th to secure a computer hard disk and an account book.

According to the prosecution, Upbeat is suspected of deceiving investors, pretending to be in the computerized world without actually holding virtual money. The prosecution will look into whether Lee Seok\-woo, president of the upbeat company, has participated in such actions. This representative took the cocoa president and assumed office in December last year.

Upbeat has been suspected that it is the 'coin transaction' without the virtual money because there are few kinds of coin wallets compared with the virtual currency types that can be traded. A coin purse is a purse that can store virtual money electronically. Without the virtual currency coin purse, the investor can not identify the virtual currency entity.

Prosecutors have been investigating virtual exchange exchanges since March, when they searched three exchanges including Coin Nest. Last month, Kim Il\-hwan, a co\-founder of Kim Il\-hwan, was indicted for bribing lawyers for the crime of heavy economic punishment. They are accused of spoofing customer money by transferring customer funds in a virtual currency exchange corporation account to a representative or officer's account.""",1526026457

"Let's not make any rash decisions based on just a few months of price action.

I don't know if you have any siblings, but picture this scenario in your mind:

A few years into the future, your brother is talking to a new friend. The notices photos of you around the house, comments on how he's never seen you before. The friend asks about you.

""That's... my brother. He's no longer with us, unfortunately"".

""Oh... if you don't mind me asking, what happened to him?""

""He took his own life after bitcoin crashed all the way from $20,000 all the way down to $8700. He just couldn't take it any more.""

""Sorry to hear that dude, that's terrible. Just out of curiosity... what's the price of bitcoin now?""

""$78,500""

""Oh...""

Can you imagine how much of a waste it would look like?

I'm sure you'll hear the usual advice of ""no amount of money is worth your life"", but let's be real, taking your life over what happens in a market this volatile is even worse, especially in a market which has a long history of absolutely brutal crashes followed by even more exponential gains.

Even when he is maybe not an outspoken fan of BCH he sure does not like what happened to BTC. 

In the end it does not matter, he is a business guy. He wants to make money. If Bitcoin Cash becomes some what succesfull he will be happy, if it goes global shapeshift will die because nobody will need any other coins.

Great move by him. I have been following BTC since late 2013 early 2014 and I remember when they first implemented BTC payments. The mainstream media said they will be pissing money. Guess he can piss on money now.,1526026028
I wouldn't buy anything except Monero and Bitcoin. Fucking scams or useless the rest of them.,1526026003
"&gt; And yet it doesn't actually prevent accidentally sending BCH to a segwit address. That can still be done on a wallet that follows the cashaddr specification. Someone made a pull request to the spec document that included language that made sending to segwit addresses actually impossible, and Amary closed the PR in less than 6 hours after it was made.

Uh, yes, it does prevent exactly that.  If wallets enforce cashaddr format, it will explicitly prevent people from sending BCH money to segwit addresses.

&gt; It is if you know what you're doing.

That's just false.  It is not true.  There is not kinder way to put it.  You're just wrong.  You keep spouting this nonsense and it's just patently false.  Saying it over and over doesn't make it more correct.

&gt; Then you change the 2 back to a 1.

You can't just revert the change once you've rolled it into production and it's being used.  Crytpocurrency isn't like other software where you can just roll out updates.  Forks have to be planned and accepted by the community, because they directly impact node consensus, which governs the ability of the network to actually function... which is the whole point of cryptocurrency.  The anology Gavin gave is a good one: you're upgrading a airplane while it's flying in the air.  If a change causes ill-effects, it may not be possible to undo it without the reversion doing even worse damage.  As an example, take BCH's disastrous EDA bullshit right after the fork.  That was an unmitigated disaster, but rolling back days of blockchain history in order to undo it would have been even worse.

&gt; BY the way, these multiple implementations aren't actually independently developing code. They are copy+pasting code from each other.

That's a fair argument, although there are at least two implementations.  Bitcoin Unlimited really does have a different code base since like 0.12.  They have been working independently.  Bitcoin ABC on the other hand, is specifically *supposed* to stay as close to Core code as possible while still being BCH compatible.  So I don't hold that as a knock against them that they ""copy"" Core's code.  Because that's specifically what their mandate is.

But again, that's a completely fair argument to make since we're talking about the benefits of multiple implementations.  I completely agree with you that there are not very many, and I wish there were more.  Because as I keep trying to explain to you, the more implementations, the better.

&gt; If a bug is ever found in cashaddr for instance, it'll effect every implementation of cashaddr because all the wallets that implement cashaddr do so by copy+pasting the code from the spec document.

Do you understand why that's an argument against your single-implementation stance?  You've just admitted that a bug that affects every client on a chain is a bad thing.  That is necessarily true for chains that only have a single implementation in addition to chains which have multiple clients that all use the same code.",1526025917

"No cryptobro - don't off yourself just yet.  There is a reason for this dip.  I believe it is all to do with the Mt. Gox sell off.  Whales will dump BTC in preparation for buying up the coins over the counter at a cheap rate.  The spaz bastard who holds the Mt Gox BTC is ready to sell off and the whales want to buy them, but not at anything like 9k.  The markets will continue to fall (probably) until all those coins have been sold off, then the market will take off like a rocket.

Just sit tight, you can either tether up now and hope that you time your re-entry correctly.  Or just hodl and stop looking at the markets every ten minutes.  Delete all the apps and web links off your phone and forget it.  Then come back in December and check your mad gainz.

I would personally go for hodling, because I constantly miss the pumps and spend half the time kicking myself because I sell out at what I think is the top, only to watch that coin go insane almost the second I sell out.

"&gt; That's an argument that would work IF Bitcoin Core was the only client. Since it's not, the argument doesn't work.  

Ah, but it's *effectively* the only client as its the only that has ever or likely will ever make any consensus protocol changes on the SegWit BTC branch. That's what makes it uniquely identifying.  

&gt; Not really, no. Any client can make consensus rules changes. The rub is that they'll just fork themselves a new coin if they don't get the majority of the network to go along with them. Unless they do a soft fork, in which case they only might fork off.

&gt; It works exactly the same way in BCH land, by the way. Any client can attempt to implement a consensus change, but they need the agreement of the majority if they want to avoid making a new chain.  

This is lip service and delusion on your part. If and when it happens, I'll admit I was wrong. But I expect the issue will outlast my lifetime.  

&gt; The fact is Bitcoin Core is just one of 6+ independent clients for Bitcoin (BTC). All of them are currently in consensus with regards to BTC protocol rules, but this can change at any time, and the community understands and accepts that this is the primary governance model prescribed by Satoshi Nakamoto in the white paper.  

Again lip service until any other team makes an independent consensus change that gets adopted by the community. Keep demonstrating your delusion, though.  

&gt; This just circles back to the whole....  

The persistence of the usage of ""Bitcoin Core"" (or alternatives) to refer to the SegWit BTC branch clearly reflects the widespread notion that what SegWit BTC is now materially quite different from what was known as ""Bitcoin"" for its first 8.5 years of existence. Personally, I don't mind sticking with BCH and BTC to distinguish, but I understand where others are coming from on this.  

&gt; I shouldn't have to point this out....  

No this is plainly obvious, but we're not the ones that began an orchestrated, concerted name calling campaign. A campaign which has never been leveled against any other cryptocurrency, whether they existed before BCH and already had ""Bitcoin"" as part of their name, or not. It's really just a petty and sad manifestation of fear, and demonstrates that no real, legitimate counterarguments can be made so the perpetrators must resort to childish name calling.  

If anything the instance on using ""Bitcoin Core"", ""Bitcoin (SegWit)"" and the like could be partially considered a *response* to /r/Bitcoin's and the Dragon's Den's widespread astroturfing campaign.",1526024563

"I think this article is pretty ridiculous. Nvidia and AMD both decided not to prepare for the 2018 GPU crypto mining market by refusing to make more chips than the previous year. As far as I understand it, they both thought that GPU mining wasn't going to be as big of a deal as it has turned out to be so far this year.

Well, they were wrong about that. Although profitability was down for a while, it's currently back up due to the price of ETH and the forking of Monero. Both obviously important altcoins.

So, are we to trust their opinion now? Their being wrong caused huge price hikes this year. We're still going through that. If they just made more cards, it wouldn't be as much of a problem...

I get it. Crypto is volatile. If I was the president of a GPU chip company I probably wouldn't be super into making mining equipment if I thought it might not be around for that long.

It's almost like the inclusion of GPUs in the decentralized network has forced a whole industry, the gaming industry, to either choose to become a part of cryptocurrency, or just suffer the price volatility and become an even more divided community. If I was a hardcore pc gamer, I would definitely mine, too. But, I'm a miner and I really don't game that much at all. Not with new cards, either.

I know this comment is all over the place, but really all I'm trying to say is that articles like this bug me because they take price charts and just write some text above the dips and act like they have uncovered some deep truth. Oh, hey, look... I can use photoshop. Woo. Look, this is what that dip means, and this is what that dip means and...yeah.

"You might be right.....or not. I have been part of BTC since it was $60 and after I watched it run to $1200, I never thought it would drop by almost 90%......but it did, and if you look at previous rally-highs-to-crash-lows, a drop of 80%-90% is the norm. 

The way I look at it is we are only going to get ""X"" amount of rallies out of bitcoin until it eventually hits its true all time high (perhaps that number is $100,000 or perhaps its $1,000,000).  If it ran to those prices straight away without crashes, then there would only be a 10X or 100X gain from here. Yet if we crash down to something like $3,000, and then rally to $100,000, and then crash again down to $10,000 and then rally to $1,000,000 the potential gains for traders is much much better.

"I know that past does not indicate future performance etc etc, and i also understand that TA in many cases does not work for volatile markets such as crypto. HOWEVER with each passing day it seems more and more likely, that when it comes to longer trends in market, what happened in the end of 2013 and what became multy year bear market is becoming more and more realistic in current market situation. It really seems to follow the very same pattern what happened starting from 2013. I know that this time there are better fundamentals, better mass adaption etc, but percent wise and human/market emotions do not change, that is a fact and it does not matter if this is dot\-com bubble or crypto bubble or soybeans.   

To conclude, if it were to be true and percent wise also ends up matching last bear market, i would guess the absolute bottom for cyrpto eventually still ends up being somewhere around 160B market cap, which \(again, if it does really ends up coping last bear market, which i hardly doubt, specially when it comes to time frame\) would mean that from current ATH, next ATH will happen around December 2020, and from there on it is new all time highs again.
