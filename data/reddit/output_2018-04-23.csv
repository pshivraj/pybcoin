"Perfect, that's a good way for me to understand it.
However, if I remember correctly, the Nano S also has the idea that it has bitcoins on it. But to know howmany bitcoins your private key refers to, it does need at any transaction point connect to the internet and connect to the blockchain to update itself on the amount of bitcoins you have.

But then I wonder. Imagine you have a private key xxxxx. You connect your Nano, and put 3 BTW on it. Then you disconnect it, and now according to your offline Nano, you have 3 BTC.

Imagine you now use that same private key xxxxx without the Nano S to transfer 1 BTC. Then I assume that the offline Nano who still shows you have 3 BTC is not correct?

or is it impossible to use your Nano private key without the Nano itself?",1524553132

"&gt; This entire exchange is based on my challenge to your assertion that a series of events (government funded research) MUST have occurred with ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY in order for Bitcoin to exist.

Challenge all you want, I'm dealing with reality.  It's ironic you call me delusional when you are the one concocting fantasy scenarios in your head where bitcoin exists without the underlying technology that allows it to operate.

In reality, the events had to unfold exactly as they had for it to create the conditions possible for Bitcoin to be created.  That is simply the nature of our deterministic universe.

I cited multiple organizations including the US navy as being bodies that govern international trade.  These things are buttressed by contracts, international laws and trade bodies.  Countries that want to participate in developed markets have to abide by the standards of those markets.

Seashells, beads, jewels, slaves, livestock, food or anything of value were used as currency before monetary gold.  That doesnt mean they were vibrant free markets that developed and deployed technology in ancient times.  You made a very specific claim that developed free markets have existed since ancient history.  Again, another delusional claim based on your pathetic interpretation of libertarianism.  The fact remains you cannot point to a free market that spontaneously emerges without a strong central government providing infrastructure.  You even got so desperate you cited the Greeks, the forefathers of logic, critical thinking, philosophy and republican democracy.  Renowned for their form of government in ancient times and shaping the very development of western civilization to this day.

So you want to talk about delusions?  Read your pathetic points dealing with alternate realities and make believe liberatarian ideology.  It is you that is brainwashed and refuses to see that these markets have been created because of strong central governments investing in infrastructure, education, security, research and development that has allowed us to become a superpower in the first place.  I never said that the free market might have created anything without government intervention, I said Bitoin would not have been possible without their development of the critical infrastructure which enables it to function.  But the irony is this entire space of innovation, namely the internet, encryption, decentralization, cpus and the tens of thousands of patents enabling this technology is largely the by product of tax dollars.  That's simply the reality.",1524552732

"This can help also for newbies:

 Everybody parroting: ""The bitcoin bubble is about to pop"" since 2009, don't know that bitcoin is a decentralized system with mathematically fixed, deflationary and limited supply currency and its growth is exponential.
So is not farfetched to say that it will be at 100,000 by 2020, since it came from less than $1 to $10,000 in less than 10 years, and it hasn't even hit the bottom part of the exponential 'S-Curve' of adoption. Here are some graphs and resources to help you do your own research:

 Remember its [fixed, limited supply of 21 million coins ever,](https://thebitcoinhustler.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/11.jpg) there are just ~4.5 million (~20%)  bitcoins left to be mined till 2140 and the production will keep decreasing (""halving"") every [4 years till then]( http://www.bitcoinblockhalf.com/).

As volume in cryptomarkets increase, would that cause the 25x appreciation factor to reduce? (i.e. 1bn new money = 25bn MC appreciation) 

If this isn’t the case, what’s driving this big appreciation factor? Is it the relative lack of trading experience those trading in crypto have?

Whilst I agree there’s a bull run on the way I think there could be 2 factors which may see it be more like a 5x rather than a 17x:

1. Reduction in market appreciation for every new dollar in

2. Hundreds of billions of fresh money are now required to push a parabolic run, as opposed to tens of billions previously. In other words, as the market cap starts from a higher base ($300bn), it becomes harder to make it grow exponentially

I actually found many negative reviews about some of the vcc providers which I will mention below, and according to user reviews I found online, some of them even committed fraud with their users' account. So I would be careful with such services.

There are many providers online, and I have chosen 4 of them and did a thorogh research. They are EntroPay, Money Polo, Neteller and Yandex Money. After doing a couple of days research I have stopped at Yandex Money because it is a trusted company and their virtual card is actually provided by a trusted bank. I found many negative reviews and user experience about all of them except for Yandex Money. Just do google their name + review and read all the reviews to see what I mean.

Yandex Money is a search engine giant, the Russian version of Google, so there are less trust issues with them. It's a reputable company and for me this was the best option.

The only downside is that it only has a Russian ruble wallet, no other currencies. If you deposit USD or any other currency in your Yandex Money wallet, the funds automatically get converted into rubles according to their rates at the time the money is received, the same applies if you spend your rubles to buy anything online in USD or other currencies.

I have also started this same thread on BitcoinTalk if you are interested:

"I got into Crypto in December, and bought in again at ATH in January. I should have Tethered until two weeks ago, and I would be doing extremely well. That's in a perfect world. 

Instead what happened was, at one point, 75&amp;#37; down on my investments. But you know what? Now I know. This market is cyclical, about FOMO, about when to get out, and when to get in. As this market will explode in to the trillions of dollars in the coming years, I have a leg up, I have learned the hard way. Sitting there, questioning myself, do I go into tether, do I just sell to USD, do I not make any moves at all? 

I am now comfortable with moving all holdings into Tether in a second, or even to Coinbase to sell for USD within 24 hours. 

It's a tough pill to swallow, but at the end of the day, there will be more crashes, there will be dips, pumps, bull runs, bear markets, and until you learn at least the basics, the fundamentals, you won't have a chance. 

We now have a chance to make a lot of money after going through this crash. Because Crypto is about to take off if not only price, but application, and acceptance. We are early in the S\-Curve of Crypto, and it stings, but in two years, when you make decisions based on what we have gone through, and we make crazy gains, it will all just be a learning experience.

"Analogies are fun, and stupid, and can usually be used to say whatever you want them to say. Satoshi effectively said “we can always build a highway in the future if we need one”. There weren’t any specific plans for how big this highway would be, where it would go, when it should be build, or what constituted “need”. We can all come up with our own common sense ideas about what blocksize scaling should have looked like, but we can’t pretend that our plan was *the* plan and Blockstream came and changed it. 

&gt;&gt; RBF is as far as I’m aware still an optional thing.

The link you so graciously provided states that “It also changes Replace by Fee (RBF) from opt-in to opt-out in the node interface”. You know what opt-in and opt-out systems have in common? You know what the shared prefix “opt” is short for? RBF is still optional you fucking moron. And we’re still only talking about the Core implementation, *not* the actual protocol.

Lastly, there is no argument that you can make that will explain how the LN constitutes Blockstream changing Bitcoin. It doesn’t. You are not a smart man.",1524550872
"&gt;The question on many regulators minds, (indeed, since the advent of cryptocurrencies) is whether or not they are to be considered a currency, a commodity, or a security (or derivative).  If it is a currency, then it is the central banks that would govern their use, a commodity, then it would be CFTC, and if it is a security, then it would be the (generally more strict) SEC.  


They arenone of the above and since congress has made no laws regarding the new invention known as crytos then no laws exist.

The republican congress is loathe to regulate this are  just as other congresses wnated to not regulate and destroy the internet.

Tue problem of government agencies seeking to expand their reach and control beyond their mandate is not new and holds little legal merit.

It is the agencies that need to be controlled and not crypto.
Republicans have already slapped the IRS for wuatthe congress viewed as overesch seeking coinbase customer info.

And remember old laws cant be expanded to things they dont cover without corrective expandedor new legislation by congress.

And expo facto laws (laws made after the fact to cover things thst already happened) are unconstitutional in the usa.

There is no doubt regulatory agencies will try but the correct stnace for any bitcoin supporter or lobby group to take is that crypto is a new invention that is NOT the same as any previously regulated activity or product and that only new laws specifically passed by congress can regulste it snd onpy in tue future.

Its important that all crypto groups align in solidarity behind these legal principles.

@Markpsp yes BITBOX can be used to build a GUI. To get a quick sense of what that looks like check out one of our scaffold apps in react/angular/next

First install `bitbox-cli`

    npm install bitbox-cli --global

Now scaffold out a react

    bitbox new myApp --scaffold react

`cd` in to the newly created `myApp` directory, install  the deps and run the ap

    cd myApp &amp;&amp; npm install &amp;&amp; npm start

After `npm` installs your dependencies a browser tab will open w/ a basic BIP44 wallet GUI. You can edit the code and save and it will recompile and refresh your tab w/ the changes.

We have a very active chat room on the Bitcoin Cash Fund's discord channel. Please join http://ambassador.cash/ and come to the #bitbox room for more help.

"BCore newbies who are concerned about what is happening.

I won't tell you to dump your BCore Bitcoin. What I will say is (especially for those with less than $1000) is perhaps think about moving your BCore BTC to an exchange just in case you want to get out.

The advise always has been ""never keep your Bitcoin at an exchange"". With Bitcoin Cash this still applies, as we spend less than a penny to move to an exchange.

With BCore this is a problem. If fees go up to just $50 (they were over $60 in December) and if you have $100 of BCore that's 50% lost even before a dump.

"Everyone has their own opinion. Some people think EOS and NEO are better than Ethereum. You don't have to think 0xbitcoin is better than ETH because it is simply different. Here is how it is different :

1) Ether was ICOed (60m), 0xbitcoin was purely mined using PoW

2) Ether is meant to be a lifeblood for the Ethereum network, 0xbitcoin is purely built to be a medium of exchange / store of value

3) Ether is not a token, 0xbitcoin is a token and thus it interacts with smart contracts differently/better.

4) Ether has no cap, 0xbitcoin is capped to 21 million

Moving in to Bitcoin...

1) Bitcoin is not an ERC20 while 0xbitcoin is

2) Bitcoin does not interact with smart contracts at all, 0xbitcoin does, such as with all Decentralized Exchanges

3) 0xbitcoin will have upgraded speed and bandwidth as Ethereum upgrades, Bitcoin will not

4) Bitcoin has lightning. 0xbitcoin has Raiden

5) Both are proof of work mined using SHA3 and both are on extremely secure blockchains. On the outside, Bitcoin and 0xbitcoin interact with the world in extremely similar ways. You can store it, mine it, and transfer it. You can build on top of it.

0xbitcoin is just trying to be the best 'bitcoin for ethereum' and it sure seems better than any Bitcoin-like currency besides Bitcoin itself in my opinion.

I'd also argue that 0xbitcoin is in the same class as Bitcoin and Ether as a trustless decentralized currency, unlike 99% of tokens. This alone is quite remarkable. The fact that you even ask the question.

I personally love the idea of Bitcoin but I also believe the Ethereum Network is going to be much faster and much more powerful and so that's why I like 0xbitcoin.

Not everyone uses reddit, or follows Roger Ver, so this could actually be generating confusion for users going to bitcoin.com looking for bitcoin cash, and not finding it.

My view is, increase adoption of BCH first, then when we have the market, look to change the name, through a massive marketing campaign, making sure everyone is aware of the change.

"I'm interested in this as well. I see a large barrier for adoption in general, not just for this application, in the volatility of any given currency.

"If you don't have access to your keys then they aren't your Bitcoin, same as a bank it's an IOU. I'm not saying they will but Coinbase could get hacked, they could freeze your account, etc. In all the history of Bitcoin and crypto it is always advised to store your own keys for the long term.

Bitcoin will increase blocksize. SegWit already did, but I refer to direct blocksize increases here. I don't think any small blocker is against raising blocksize - just not now, not in near future. Bitcoin is doing it the right way. Bcash is just a scam coin created to preserve Jihan's Covert AsicBoost privilege. No matter what it will include in the future, it is not comparable to Bitcoin.

"&gt; &gt; What is it going to take to get a hub to commit to the possibility of sending me a few hundred dollars over the course of 6-12 months?
&gt; 
&gt; They'd be receiving that money simultaneously on another one of their channels, they're not giving you a handout. And they can collect a small fee on that transaction.

This is one area where I might well be missing something... 

My understanding is that when you open a channel to a peer, both you and the peer need to commit as much Bitcoin as you feel will be transacted over the lifetime of the channel. So if I want to sell stuff on EBay, I might expect to see a net positive of several thousand dollars or more over a year. But maybe not. I'm sure that hubs will be more than happy to accommodate buyers, where they can open a channel with little or no contribution on their part. But what business is going to be willing to tie up significant funds in a channel for me, on the off chance that I'll end up receiving a bunch of payments? 

As for the routing comment - I agree that most transaction paths will be quite short, probably 3 to 5 hops or so.  But there are going to be a huge number of nodes, most of which will be small, poorly connected leaf nodes. And even the specific channels between well connected hubs will be somewhat ephemeral. When I want to pay for my alpaca socks, is the solution to finding an adequate (never mind best) route scalable. There are models that might be applicable - TOR's onion routing and/or BGP.  But I haven't seen anyone claim that they have developed an algorithm that when tested in simulation allows the Lightning Network to function at thousands or tens of thousands of times of the current size. And I have heard people with much more network routing experience than myself express doubts. The routing problem is clearly difficult. But it must be solved, as LN depends being able to quickly and efficiently allow transactions to be directed through several unrelated nodes to the destination. ",1524546085

"How about skip ads altogether. Check out Kin. It aligns the incentives of the developers with their users. Developers get compensated fairly for their work via the Kin Rewards Engine (KRE), based on transaction volume in Kin within their app. Users are encouraged to earn and spend Kin, and create new value within the ecosystem of apps that adopt Kin. The users benefit because they don't have to watch any ads ever, and they have better app quality because the developers are incentivized to create great app experiences to engage users and create large transaction volume. The more volume, the more rewards they are paid via the daily KRE payout. Everyone wins. It's a new way for developers to monetize without abusing user data like Facebook, and without using ads.

It's about to go live in the Kik app, and once it does, it'll be the most-used cryptocurrency in the world (that's not an exagerration. It really will be). Crypto has about 6 million active users. Kik has 15 million monthly active users. It's going to blow everything away. And that's just Kik! Wait til their partner apps start integrating in Q3. Hundreds of millions of users incoming.

Ex: If miners _decide_ to produce 16MB blocks, nodes who run with settings below that won't accept their blocks.  Full nodes have the power.  Miners are beholden to what the users want and what the users want is determined by what code they run and which settings.  At least that's how it is on Bitcoin.

If miners all decide they don't wanna go along with it, then the difficulty will freefall and full node operators will dust off their 2 generations old ASICs and pick the coin back up.  Remember, Bitcoin worked fine when it was just normal CPUs mining.  If miners want Bitcoin, they have to mine the chain with the most consensus.  Miners can make whatever other coins they want, and that's likely what happened with Bitcoin Cash - for miners, developed by the miners, run by the miners, forked off because miners wanted their own consensus.  And that's fine by me, MinerCoin is still relatively useful as a store of value and method of transfer, but the sphere of consensus (number of people making decisions about what the coin is) is dozens of people wide, rather than worldwide.",1524543604

"I'm not sure how much you're working with, but Ian Balinas approach is a decent one despite his questionable nature. He holds around 25% of his net worth in solid coins like Ethereum, BTC, and LTC.

I feel this is less safe than your 85% holding strategy, but significantly more profitable. I got in on Ethos (BQX) at ICO at .05cents and it hit $10 in January. These returns in 6 months time will yield you significantly more money faster.

I suggest you look into Covesting or Ethos. Both will have social aspects where users can publicize their profiles and trading strategies and ultimately *earn* based off their success.

Well they outta know.  Bankers are crooks and Bitcoin makes everyone a banker.  Seems like airtight logic to me.,1524542430

So yeah, I am not the right strawman for you because that's not what I've been like. I had enough invested where I could make an nice chunk of money if it climbs up again, but not so much invested that it would be a massive loss if it failed entirely. So I can be amused by a bear market and enjoy a bull market. If we do climb to another ATH and crash again, I will buy at the bottom of that with all my profits off this bull run, then I will not be able to mock people during a bear market again.

"True kind of tough in this market to call the ups and downs. I’m sure many like me have realized there often is no rhyme or reason to it. Market sentiment is its own entity that ebbs and flows. Many blame whales, FUD, media, fomo, twitter personalities, Wall Street, Asia... whatever; the point is that it’s literally all or nothing and at some point you have to realize that every one of those things and yes - even reddit - has impact on this markets general sentiment. A keen eye and professional trader might be able to put his ear to the rail and hear the train coming but for every one like him there are 9 others caught just as blindsided when a bear runs up and mauls them in the ass while they are listening to railroad tracks. 

That’s honestly the best analogy I could think of to describe this market....

I'm not even joking.  Here's a quote:

&gt; Per chapter 2 of my own book, Bitcoin ideology is literally based in conspiracy theories, tracing back to the gold bug and Federal Reserve theories of the John Birch Society and Eustace Mullins. Many Bitcoiners aren’t actively aware of this, though they’ll generally be familiar with the versions advocated by Ron Paul last decade.

"There is no reality, where you can dismiss any and all risk to cryptos, therefore they are all equal. That's not how this market works.
*I never said that.

You just spent two to three paragraphs telling me Modum was not risky compared to ""other cryptos"". You have no idea how to evaluate risk.
*I never said it wasn’t risky compared to other cryptos. It simply depends on the crypto. Is it risky compared to Ethereum? Clearly. Is it risky compared to bitconnect? Obviously not. See how that works? 

The fact that you don't have the ability to define different risks in different cryptos is a massive flaw in your abilities as a investor and a trader. That's not reality. There is no way the risks between BTC and DOVU, or ETH and DOGE are the same. None. Only a complete fool would believe that.
*Man you are jumping to conclusions about me, and we haven’t even finished our first date! At least buy me a drink first before telling me I’m easy. I am not comparing those projects to Modum. I’m not saying there aren’t differences in risk levels among the various projects in the space, I’m just saying they are ALL – yes…every single one of them, very high risk compared to any other traditional investing product.  Modum has given us a straightforward answer about how they are conducting their business, and we have seen their product, and we think they are a real company and not some scam. 

Cryptos are not all the same.
*I agree. Never said they were. But they ARE all risky.

The entire mod subreddit was brigadding /r/cc. The mods even said so.
*Lighten up man. Nobody is trying to take your money, and we don’t need saving. I’m sorry if you lost money investing on MOD when other investments were outperforming it, but we’re not all that bad, and the people behind the project seem to really be trying to build a reputable company solving a real problem in the pharma logistics niche market. No one is claiming MOD will be the next top 5 coin, it is a very focused project, but that doesn’t mean it’s a shit coin and an exit-scam-in-waiting. 

You're not disproving anything. You're just adding to my argument that the investors of this token are immature and incompetent.
*I wasn’t trying to disprove anything. And nah, I’m not adding to that argument at all. I’m simply stating the obvious truth that applies to the entire crypto community. Show me a crypto telegram or subreddit that doesn’t have tribalism and immaturity coursing through its veins. You can’t.  

You can't dismiss risk, and other happenings or possibilities based on ""teams"", ""partnerships"", ""feelings"" or ""potential"". Modum IS what it is. If variables were changed I might be it's biggest fan. It's the details that matter.
*No one is dismissing risks. We all weigh risks based on our own due diligence, or for the immature investor – FOMO, but the point is that most of us know what Modum is, and what it is not. I am just trying to comfort you, and let you know that it is ok to let go of the fight against Modum. No one is after you, and we get your points. 

Those people are for lack of a better word, stupid. Shares are a highly evolved financial product that has centuries of trust behind them. They work really really well. Notably in preventing things like I'm talking about from happening (exit scams, false promises, embezzlement). They ensure accountability, and compensation. Not promises and speculation.
*And what a lack it is. I know what a share is, thanks. 

Perhaps I am. That's for you to decide. Frankly with the actions of other coins, I don't believe that upvotes or downvotes from a brigade is the truth in regards to what is really happening.
*Yeah, perhaps. I don’t believe they represent the truth either. 

The last thing I said in my post was ""invest wisely"". I don't care that people invest in MOD. I care that they call it a share and think their investment is immutable.
*Point taken, but it really does seem like you care a whole lot. 

This is all publically available information. I don't see why it's so controversial. Wait, I do. Because bagholders have a lot to lose just like any other investment, and use tactics like personal attacks, downvotes (suppression), and other tactics to try to discredit me. Someone even called me a TRON fan.
*The information is not controversial, your delivery just leans negative. Any information or helpful insights should always be welcome. But you’re right, there will always be people who are afraid of the light exposing the weaknesses of their beloved investments. We’re all human. Peace.

Invest at your own risk.
*I always do.

Bitcoin is a network of users.  The value of a network is often thought to increase exponentially as participants in the network increase.  First mover advantage has a huge effect on the number of participants of the Bitcoin network in comparison to other crypto networks.

After learning what bitcoin it, I've learned more and more about how corrupt our government and many government's are and understand more clearly why the rich continue to get richer and the poor are fighting for scraps. It's idealistic to thing bitcoin will overtake the  banking industry and the elites but it's worth a risk of part of my wealth.

Way to many people work their life away only to have everything stripped away from them while many people hoard all the money in the world. If there is any chance that crypto curriences,  bitcoin or blockchain can at least help a little bit your damn right I as well as many others will invest time or money to see it happen even if it's not as user friendly or practical right now. Technology always has hurdles and something that can be revolutionary will absolutely have it's ups and downs.

"Nope.
*Yep.

You compared them to ""startups"". That is all.
*Right. Because they are. They just used an ICO.

Didn't say they did. I said usually ""startups"" give you equity or shares for putting up cash. Which is true in the world of business.
*Irrelevant to this conversation.

Yes. What does that have to do with what you said?
*I think you know.

lol what? What do you think they dump the ETH for?
*So ETH is the same as cash now? That’s going to hurt your argument.

What a majestic backpedal. Pure damage control man. Just don't. I'm not stupid.
*It wasn’t majestic, nor was it backpedaling or damage control. Never said you were stupid. You could’ve inferred quite the opposite if you read what I wrote with a little less cynicism.

Oh brother. This argument again. Let me guess? The team wants to unlock the tokens because they get more money!? Wow it's fucking nothing man. They don't need the tokens. They payment is already being made. It's called financing a company debt-free and interest-free. Do you know how hard it is to get that much money to finance a company without giving up tremendous equity? Clearly you don't.
*Awe. Don’t get so flustered by such an obvious conclusion that people want to make more money. It is the most obvious argument and you are totally dismissing it because you don’t think it’s enough money to justify it. Only time will tell who is right about this. 


The company that buys them out doesn't care about the token. They want the intellectual property, patents, and talent. That is all. The token itself is listed as a liability apparently.
*You know nothing about this hypothetical company that wants to buy them out. Tokenizing a business is clearly an easy way to fund operations in a company, that’s why they do it. It doesn’t make sense for them to discard the tokens as if they were trash. Just follow that fairytale out a bit further. What happens next? Ok, they sell the company and leave the tokenholders empty-handed. Then what? We all just walk away, and the company’s reputation goes unscathed? OR, is it more likely that tokens become an integral part of the way they raise funds (for other projects, say) and pay out dividends in the future as well, with the new company? It worked BEAUTIFULLY for them once, why wouldn’t they do it again, and again? More creativity please. Less cynicism. 

Are you actually that deluded, that you would equate the price of the Modum token to the potential profits being earned? Seriously? There is not one metric that would allow to even remotely calculate that.
*Seeing as that is what they have decided to base the dividends off of, then yes, it would be, if not exactly, then very similar to the same metrics used to calculate the value of a stock. 


Your attempt to tie it to big blue chip dividend stocks is ridiculous. Those stocks have consistently paid out dividends for years. They have stability and profitability. Huge market capitalization. Comparing the two is preposterous.
*We’re talking about the way one would go about finding value. Consistently paying out dividends for years has nothing to do with whether or not Modum plans to do the same. Comparing them in terms of the way they bring value to their investors is not preposterous, it is logical. I’m not saying Modum is as stable or has a huge market capitilaziation. I’m saying it would make sense to take as much legacy knowledge from existing corporate dividend structures as possible. Modum doesn’t have to re-create the wheel when there are a couple hundred years of precedent showing how it’s done. They’re just adding one component.


Everything about it smells like an exit scam. If I was a shareholder in MOD, I would vote to sell the minute we got a great offer. I don't give a shit about the token holders. I have no legal responsibility to compensate them. I'm not liable for their contracts.
*Again, you are underestimating greed, and projecting ill-intent where absolutely none has been indicated or even remotely suggested. Also, I’m glad you’re not a shareholder.

That means nothing. A partnership with a uni is a cheap way to get interns. A partnership with a corp is doing a proof of concept to potential buyers. The MOD token is not integral to ANY of this.
*You’re getting sidetracked.  I said nothing about it being integral to the MOD token. It is self-evident that the more established institutions the project is in bed with, the more rapport they have as a legitimate business. There will always be the Enrons and Madoffs of the world, but a lack of a contractual guarantee in the hypothetical circumstance of a buyout is far down my list of reasons to worry about an exit scam. 


The smartest way to do that is to sell the company shares to the highest bidder at the best possible price. It has nothing to do with the token.
*That’s not only extremely myopic, but also arguably the least beneficial way to retain the reputation and professional rapport of the business. Just think about it for 2 seconds man. It would be cutting off their nose to spite their face. Again, this is blindingly obvious to anyone not looking for the absolute worst in people.


Ah the ol' ""they're all scams, so this scam ain't bad"" argument. What a fallacy. There are other measures of success and integration is other cryptos. Wold you honestly compare MOD to ETH? Would you dismiss ETH so easily? This level of delusion for a coin sitting in the low 200's is completely insane. There are reasons it's there. It has nothing to do with ""marketing"" or ""quiet teams"". It's the token use case. It sucks.
*Nope. I said nothing about everything else being a scam. That is you projecting your own cynicism onto my comments. I think there are lots of good projects, and that modum is one among many. I would not compare MOD to ETH because they have virtually nothing in common. The exception being that they are both high risk investments. Again, this is obvious. I own ETH. Why would I dismiss it? I don’t see your point.  


The amount of risk is not solely calculated based on your ability to receive payouts.... That's the use case for MOD. Which is low probability? Are you honestly implying that holding ETH or XLM is the same probability of failure? That would be...unwise.
*I didn’t say the amount of risk was calculated based solely on the ability to receive payouts. It being low probability that they ever pay them out is your opinion, and you are free to have it. I disagree.  I’d love to see the metrics you are using to determine the probability of failure of these various projects. You don’t think there are other ICO and payment platforms that are aggressively competing for Ethereum and Stellar’s spots on CMC? You don’t think those spaces are every bit as competitive as supply chain logistics? Come now. Surely you jest. I’m not saying Modum is the obvious winner in the end – whenever ‘the end’ is, but neither are ETH or XLM (I’m invested in both btw.).


I dumped my MOD bags long ago. What's funny is how the Modum community seems to take basic facts so personally. Non-controversial facts. Things like ""You assume all counterparty risk"", ""The token is not a share"" and ""An exit scam is possible"".
*You can’t find a single exasperated, angry, or even slightly emotional comment from my response to you. Why would you say I am taking anything personally? Your oft-cited statements about counterparty risk, and the true, worthless nature of the MOD token are very well understood by now. An exit scam is possible for virtually all cryptos. I fail to see how Modum is just primed and ready to leave us all holding bags.  Any ICO that received a crypto that they then cashed out in order to operate their businesses could have done, and still could do that, at any time. There is nothing unique about this.

*You sold your bags long ago? Well, the plot thickens. Now I really don’t know why you’re here, and I say that as genuinely as possible.  Now you have identified yourself. A good-hearted whistleblower who feels the need to save us all from our own incompetence. I get it. 


K buddy. Everything has equal risk, compared to Betcoonnek. That's insane.
*Never said everything has equal risk. I would, however, argue that, compared to any traditional investment asset, ANY crypto is considered high risk. That is obvious. You are the one bringing in bitconnect with a conversation about Modum. That’s ridiculous, and you know it. You yourself owned modum at one point. I hope like hell you didn’t own bitconnect. As you said, you’re not stupid. 


Blind faith? ETH is going to work whether I believe in it or not. So is XLM. There are powers way beyond my control that are determining those projects fates. They have arguably approached Emergence. Especially ETH and BTC.
*Yes, they will work based on all kinds of assumptions that you’ve chosen to believe are reasonable. There are hundreds of ways those projects could fail or be taken out by their competition. You know this too but you still believe they will succeed (I do too, by the way).

"What normal people are mining Bitcoin today...? I feel like that ship sailed a long time ago. Why would you? It's cheaper to mine alts and trade to Bitcoin. ASIC miners are doorstops the second they can't pay the bills; altcoin mining equipment (eg FPGA or GPUs) can happily move to different PoW's and have a lower buy-in, and can be resold for uses even outside cryptocurrency. It's a no brainer unless you've got an in with the ASIC manufacturers (better than your competition).

I don't think that's ever going to change regardless of your blockchain parameters unless you change to a different PoW, and I believe Bitcoin has made it very clear that's only a nuclear option if an option at all.

Now, the argument for a normal person being able to run a full node with a full copy of the blockchain is a valid one in terms of bandwidth/storage. I wouldn't stress storage though, I just bought 4x8TB 3.5"" drives at $139 a piece. Even with a blocksize of 32MB (which I think is high) my $139 just future proofed me for...

4x24x32 = 3GB a day if full blocks... Which works out to about 8000/3 ~= 2500 days. Amortized to cost we're looking at $139/2500 =~ $0.06 a day. I'd be surprised if we're using anything that resembles the current Bitcoin that far down the road anyway.

However, this also means you're downloading and uploading up to 3GB each day, probably at least 3-4x that since it's peer to peer... That's doable on a lot of consumer connections in the US but it's painful; ever try to use the internet when someone is aggressively torrenting? And your ISP will definitely notice that 250+GB usage per month if you don't have a high end connection in a good area. That's over most ISPs caps (usually in the small print) for middle-of-the-road plans in the US. So now you may have isolated people without great internet from being able to run a full node if those blocksizes are full.

Now if you go the 1GB blocksize route, now we're in trouble since you've amplified the issues above. My $139 only buys 80 days of full blocks. Now it's a financial issue, not just internet accessibility. If you're spammed to 1GB blocks for a month, people running from consumer ISPs are going to be turning people off (and that's even if it'll work at a technical level).

Personally I don't mind any of this. I don't think everyone should run a full node. I think everyone should have someone they trust to run a full node, or pool money together to operate one if they're so inclined. Normal people don't run full nodes today either. I don't see that changing due to the lack of incentive; only people with the know-how and interested in maintaining the integrity of the chain are going to do it, so maybe they're willing to drop the cash for that sake alone. I suspect old Bitcoiners will be doing this (and already do). But I wouldn't expect that from a normal person.",1524537240

"With fees as low as they are now Bitcoin is certainly better for merchants than credit cards. Credit cards run around ~3% fees for the merchant (or so I'm told), and they have to deal with the hassles of chargebacks. 

With cash there is the cost of counting, processing and getting it to the bank safely, as well as the issue of counterfeiting. Again for merchants it's a win from that standpoint. With the LN the time to confirm a TX will be shorter than a credit card TX, so that's the point at which it becomes a viable alternative for real-life TX. But even now it's quite viable for most online purchases.

The real competition for Bitcoin isn't from the 20th-century dinosaurs like credit cards, but from the 2nd and 3rd generation cryptocurrencies like Nano.

"&gt; You cannot start to create hierarchies for motive, or deployment process. one that is in control of mining processes is a miner, regardless of where that expending of energy is happening.

That's a fair statement, but what I was trying to respond to was that your wording implied a connection between the two groups in some way, though you may not have intended that.

&gt; but you are assuming that the miners and manufacturers of ASICS prefer free markets, than oligarchical markets. I am not sure if this is a correct assumption to make.

A fair statement, but there's a lot of evidence and reasoning to show that this would be a preference - at least after the first few months of an ASIC's first successful manufacture.  Regardless it isn't important so I'll concede that assumption and move on.

&gt; As i stated right at the start, there is a cost to changing chains that outweighs the increase in fees.

Changing PoW (or other developer-driven counters) isn't a change of chains though, the ecosystem is mostly going to follow the developers unless there's a huge ideological push favoring the miners (which is simply a community fork at that point).

&gt; They mentioned the proposal (citing decrease in block reward and worsening profitability). it was rejected, they went ahead with their plans anyway.

Ok, let's run with this.  In this case, they are actively orphaning non-compliant miners, a clear cartel.  Your top 6 gives them 61.5% of the hashrate.  Of those top pools, most of those don't actually own large mining farms themselves.  What percentage of the actual end miners will support this action and continue to mine to the pools attacking?  I'll assume 100% since they want the increased revenue, but naturally this would not be 100% in the real world.

The next important question is where the businesses and exchanges stand.  The main entities running transaction-receiving/sending nodes.  Do they back the miners?  If so, this isn't an attack, this is community split over reward value, and there's nothing I can suggest to mitigate the damage of a community split, as it is supposed to be damaging.  I'm going to assume they do not back the miners as this is an attack scenario we're discussing.

In this case, there's a number of different things the developers can do.  Let's start with the easiest and least impactful.  The developers release an emergency update that adds a softfork rule(Note: I'm using BTC distribution from your link, even though you said BCH distribution): 

&gt; &gt; *From blockheight N to N+90 days, a valid blockchain must have the following breakdowns, at minimum, to be considered valid by fullnodes:*

&gt; &gt; 1. *Must have 2.3% btc.top blocks (1/2 of current 4-day avg 4.6%)*
&gt; &gt; 2. *Must have 1.5% BTCC pool blocks (1/2 of current 4-day avg 3.1%)*
&gt; &gt; 3. *Must have 0.9% bitcoin.com pool blocks (1/2 of current 4-day avg 1.8%)*
&gt; &gt; 4. *And so on down through the other notable mining pools...*

Assuming, of course, that btc.top, BTCC, and bitcoin.com supported the developers' desire for less full blocks.  As a soft fork with a sunset condition, this would never need to be included in the  permanent Bitcoin ruleset, and the code requiring this could be completely removed after the sunset.

This simple softfork requirement fucks over the attacker's strategy of blacklisting non compliant miners.  If they didn't have enough of the other miners in their chain, they'd fork off the network, and their blocks would be considered invalid by the rest of the network.

Not ideal, of course, but with the other miners being able to fill 8mb of blockspace they would get both the higher fee benefit and be able to pick up a lot of the slack from the cartel's restriction.  Let's try again with a different strategy, also a softfork with sunset.

&gt; &gt; *From blockheight N to N+180 days, a block will be considered invalid if its average fee is &gt; 10 satoshi per byte unless it contains &gt; 7mb out of 8mb *

Voila, Cartel cannot leverage their strategy without full blocks.  Of course they could simply spam the blocks to satisfy the rules, but they can *already* do that, so it isn't unique to this scenario.  If they were spamming the blocks and orphaning non-compliant miners, the above strategy would help mitigate the issue.  The developers could also put a temporary cap on average fee of blocks, neutering the effect of the spam.  Most likely as this countering begins to unfold, some individuals will switch their miners from the attackers' pools to competing pools, as the developers could actually make the competing pools temporarily more profitable.  But if this game of cat and mouse escalated, the obvious choice would be a PoW change, which would end the attack.

All of this is possible in a decentralized system because the exchanges and transacting nodes follow the developers.  The miners getting stuck on the wrong side of the fork is the disastrous punishment for them that they must avoid.

&gt; This is proven not to be the case.

&gt; Indeed, the whole reason that BCH exists is because (supposedly) one group wrestled control.

&gt; Did it end badly for them? Not really.

Oh this game is far from over.  I'm not sure why you would think it is over.  The punishments for some of these things take years to really be reflected.  I would say it is already proven to be the case - merchants and businesses have begun accepting altcoins extremely rapidly to the point where support for multiple coins is now basically the top priority for nearly every big-name ""Bitcoin"" business, but we will have to wait and see if that results in the economic punishment that I expect for BTC hodlers.

FYI, I don't personally buy the ""one group wrestled control"" unless the ""one group"" is very diverse and much larger than what is usually implied.  It doesn't matter for my evaluation - the community split, and the damage to the largest / original chain from that split is still being done.  In the last 10 days BCH has doubled in ratio - quite surprising to me really, but we'll see where it goes.

&gt; though empirical evidence suggests that a host of businesses in the sphere love high fees. because, guess what?

&gt; it means they can charge even higher fees! see any number of exchange withdrawal fees.

Is that what segwit2x was about?  I seem to recall it being the opposite...

&gt; again, i stated my main assumption, that the cost of moving chains outweighs the increase in transaction costs.

My above examples don't require moving chains.  The community &amp; businesses/exchanges simply need to be on board with the developers.  If they're not, the scenario isn't an attack so much as a community split, and that's very very different.

"I need help, don’t bail on me. 

First mover has value because it paves the way for other crypto. No bitcoin, not interest/value. 

On chain scaling is difficult. SegWit is still being implemented. Only segwit addresses are efficient. Going from one to another is still costly. The blinded “hodlers” won’t pay those fees. BCash is currently more useable. And I hate all Bitcoin forks as a fan of Crypto. A forked coin can’t possibly have a value of millions because a developer decided to fork. 

Bitcoin can do it better? I understand onchain scaling is happening but a coin like XLM does it without lightning. And they will implement lightning which is over 10,000 transactions per second. They have their own staking method. What happens when POW becomes invaluable? Only ASICs builders can provide the power to truly compete now. BTC is not truly decentralized.  Mining pools still contribute to centralization. 

Unless I’m missing something it’s kinda ignorant to say BTC is the best coin if it has to adopt other tech. I don’t want to start a major debate but what am I missing? The price of BTC dies if Satoshi sells. The price is partially propped by people who can’t access coins from the old days. 

I would have a harder time understanding how printing money out of thin air works. It’s just that I don’t understand how currently bitcoin is so valuable if other tech is better besides solely a first mover. ",1524534652

"Best advice I can give is what *not* to do. 

-	Don’t take everything every crypto you tuber says to heart. This space is new and there are no experts at all - just people with different opinions and some happen to be right. That said, if you do go into that space, datadash, coinmastery, crypto daily and Ivan on tech are all good.
-	With the same logic, don’t take *anything* anyone says on reddit or any other forum to heart either. Everyone has their own bags and chances are that they are unbiased is low. Always do your own research whether there is overwhelming good or bad talk about any given crypto. You may not be able to read a good white paper from a bad one and so, watch *multiple* reviews on YouTube and look up threads about that crypto to get a general feel of what it is. Another tool I found very helpful for research is going on any given cryptos telegram channel and speaking to the admins directly. To start you off, I’d recommend you look into ven and omg. Why? Because **I** hold them and **I** believe they are one of the better investments. But a random redditors word shouldn’t be ground for an investment. Other great projects I like, but am not invested in, are Neo and Iota (the high market cap is one of the reasons I didn’t invest and the other is a lack of money). Take note that because you’re new, I only suggested - and would recommend - top 25 coins as they are ‘safer’
-	When investing, **dollar cost average**. If you’re holding for the long term, you can put in your investment in one go as the small swings that don’t matter. This way you won’t have to worry about a coin potentially dropping or going up because you’re averaging in. Another **personal** recommendation, and it might be unconventional, is to aim to ‘collect’ whole numbers of any crypto. As an example, aim to accumulate 1,000 of PoopCoin and your goal is for poopcoin to reach $10 each so your investment will be worth $10k. This is important because a) you won’t want to try day trading and losing your whole number (whole numbers are more appealing) and b) you won’t be holding forever like a chicken with your head cut off.
-	Lastly, research research research. Your confidence in your investment is proportional to your knowledge about blockchain technology and the project itself. Crypto is the only investment I hold right now and I can give you pages of reasons why - but this doesn’t translate over to you and you need to find your own reasons of why you’re invested, how much you’re invested and for how long.

My fingers are getting tired of typing, but if you have any other questions don’t be afraid to shoot them over. Remember to never buy in on any coin that saw a big price increase as it is bound to come down. And likewise, don’t pull out of a coin that saw a major drop. If it’s the entire market that spiked up or down, it is okay to reallocate your holdings to something you’re more comfortable with. Don’t chase the “moonshots”. Chase the solid projects. Making money in this market isn’t going to be about finding a good project, but more about just not investing in the bad projects. ",1524534067

"Fundamental Bitcoin 101 is consensus. It's literally the number one rule of what constitutes Bitcoin, and what does not. We had overwhelming majorty support for SW. BCH had a couple of percent of the miners fork off. Its not even contravercial. By your logic if someone forked back to version 1 of Bitcoin, then they would rightly be the original Bitcoin. BCH is only the original Bitcoin if you value human politics and opinions over the protocols and rules of blockchain technology, and we will never ever ever give in to that nonsense. Maybe Bitcoin failed. Great, so continue with your fork of the UTXO set and make a better Bitcoin. Just stop trying to desperately rewrite history based on your own politics.

"Yes bitcoin started a technological revolution, however this is not about bitcoin it is much bigger than that.     
The only realistic product bitcoin is good for is as a speculative commodity. The irony is that value relies on hype, and hype increases on the assumption that bitcoin will be more than just a speculative commodity, but it will not.   
Once everyone realizes and comes to terms with that, that is when we will see its real worth, tip... it will be a fraction of its current value.    

New technical methods will come up to take its place, that is the nature of technology. Perhaps those new methods have been created already perhaps not. But there will be others that will come up.   

People seem to either use bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, blockchain and DLT interchangeably or conflate all or a combination of those terms to either push an agenda or simply do it blindly out of ignorance while trying to build hype.

"Some here mentioned that Bcash is - also - a project of Bitmain. 
Many in this forum underestimate the power behind Ver, Wu, Wright and their group of fraudsters.

Their financial resources are huge. And they are using them. Not for any political or ideological reason. But for centralizing Bitcoin and making more money, thus gaining more power.

Furthermore, they have built a well working network of money-whores all over the world.

Just a little example: Wu has established Bitmain Switzerland. On the board is Christian Meisser. Luzius Meisser (not sure if this is his son, but I was told so on IRC) is his son. He sits in the board of the Swiss Bitcoin Association, on the board of Bitcoin Suisse, is one of the main players in Switzerland's ""Crypto Valley"" Zug. Just to give you an idea how Meisser and the Swiss Bitcoin Association is crawling into Wright's, Wu's and Ver's asses, watch this video:

[Arsecrawl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiK34QicusI)

These people do all for money. And Ver, Wright and Wu have plenty of it.

Some here argue that no lawsuit should be filed because Bitcoin is against the government. This is somewhere between noble and stupid. If Ver and his buddies are not stopped, it may be that the experiment of Bitcoin sooner or later will become a footnote in the history of cryptocurrency. The only one laughing then will be the governments.

I strongly encourage each and everyone who has lost money, be it by being mislead by these fraudsters, by having lost money due to a pump-and-dump, be it by losing money due to spamming the mempool, be it by whatever other reason which can be tied to Ver, Wright, Wu or one of their companies: File lawsuits. Never mind if they will be successfull: Also send a copy to newspapers.

File lawsuits in the US against CNBC, Coinbase or whoever is involved in the pump-and-dump-scheme and insider trading promoted by Ver or in Great Britain against Coinbase in London.

File lawsuits against Roger Ver in Japan. Complain at the Financial Market Authorities there.

If living in Europe or Switzerland: File lawsuits against Wu and Bitmain in Switzerland. You can also file suit against its directors there (Jihan Wu, Ti Liu and Christian Meisser) or against the Swiss Bitcoin Association for actively participating in a fraud.

But if you think Ver and his buddies will disappear by the sheer superiority of Bitcoin's technology - you may as well send your Bitcoins to me and get back into your bubble.

And the most interesting part is that new features can be easily added via its governance mechanism, so it'll likely undergo a PoS algorithm upgrade as well as privacy upgrade within the next two years. It's essentially a futureproofed blockchain that'll support robust statically typed formally verifiable contracts out the gate in two different languages.

It also doesn't require ginormous datacenters and massive wealth in order for people to be a delegate in the DPoS algorithm (like EOS does) which is frankly entirely against the point of crypto.

And practically speaking Tezos has a gigantic Bitcoin and Ethereum warchest at this point which it'll be able to use to fuel development of upgrades and support dapp creators.",1524531960

I can see how the parts work, and I can see that it will work well enough in a test environment.

My favorite is that bch has no 'reference implementation' (because they couldn't make one if they wanted to) and is instead is used by other clients that choose to support it, some of which simply take bitcoin core and change the block increase while stripping other features. Weird.

"You all realise that those gains represent a percentage not the amount of aditional market cap.

It takes a lot more money entering the system to make BTC rise than to make BCH rise.

So if anything all this shows is that (1) BTC had more capital invested than BCH over the last week, and (2) all anyone cares about here is gainzz.....

Maybe I should change the title to.. “this is what bitcoin and crypto are up against.” Would that suit it better? Either way, I’m tired of defending BCH as a use case, and I’m even more tired of sifting through all of the trolling posts from people that don’t even understand the first thing about the history of bitcoin.

That's why they can't fork s2x last year September. When they try to increase block from 1mb to 2mb, half the people probably threaten to mine the 1mb shitcoin so Blockstream's s2x will become an altcoin. They are stuck in 1mb forever and they don't realize it. That's why we know they will eventually be extinct, literally every alt coin in existence had better use case than BTC, it's just a matter of when, not why.",1524530462

"*Bitcoin Core developers lose the last shred of their credibility as they admit their entire roadmap is completely broken: 4 years of ""work"" and ~$100M in investor money already gone.

* They desperately try to code up an upgrade, only to have the miners refuse to run it because BCH is now absolutely their best option and there's no reason to keep their userbase split.

* Core codes up a PoW change and deploys it, miners continue on the old BTC chain so long as users support it. The new fork is just another coin on the market and the old BTC ticker stays with the deprecated and now largely abandoned chain.",1524530439

/r/btc philosophy is you don't have to ask permission. Just do it. Why don't you  do it and seek your own answer.,1524530365

EDA isn't the Bitcoin I signed up for,1524530351
"People ask this question fairly frequently.

BTC devs have spent years brainwashing their followers that hard forks and increasing the block size even the tiniest bit is a reckless,  malicious attack on bitcoin that will centralize mining and destroy the blockchain.  This brainwashing has been so effective that if the core devs even whispered a hint of it, all the btc followers would scream that btc has been compromised by the NSA or bought out by Roger Ver.  They would sell everything for litecoin and BTC would instantly crash to $0.

So don't worry,  they painted themselves into a corner and the only way out is if Zeus himself descends from the heavens and performs a miracle of engineering to transform the lightning network from an incomprehensible fragile clusterfuck into an elegant, robust, simple, and cheap system... and only then it will be equivalent to BCH, not even better.",1524530322
Reddit no longer accepts Bitcoin directly,1524530322
BTC is excited today,1524530268
"Then lightning would be completely pointless since there will be no incentive for people to do off chain transactions. Will core decide to throw years of their R&amp;D away? Maybe if they are desperate enough.

Lets say they get miners support and pulled of a non-contentious hardfork,  by then they would be doing what bch is already doing, why would people buy btc and not bch? it'd only be a better buy if a) they can do what bch is doing but they are cheaper OR b) they can do it better than bch. Developers who want this new btc would just move on to bch before all this drama even happens.",1524530266
"to me the 0 fees are absolutely a crazy and useless idea....so ok, yes nano can work with 0 fees but that makes the network much more insecure by not incentivizing nodes, you could just sprout endless fake nodes and create a sybil attack on the network. since nano doesnt have blocks and doesnt technically require fees, you could set fees in a unique way that no other crypto has - by percentage of transaction size....eaven a really small percentage like 0,1% or 0.05% would make the network much more secure and as a user you wouldnt eaven feel it.....eaven if you lets say buy a 1000$ laptop and you pay a 1/0.5$ transaction fee on that to have an instant transaction i think thats still amazing....sure if you have to transfer a 100k than you could as well use btc but anyone in their right mind who wants to transfer a big amount of money would be using btc anyway. and also nano want to be a day-to-day currency for instant transactions so if your coffee instead of costing 2$ costs 2.002$ that is not really a problem. the merchant that would accept nano instead of credit/debit card would be getting his money instantly and without paying fees to visa/mastercard, which means he could lower his prices a little bit which would make the fees absolutely irrelevant to you as a consumer- a win win situation for everyone.

"&gt; I think it was clear I meant crypto startups. 

Nope.

&gt;We are in a cryptocurrency sub aren't we? 

You compared them to ""startups"". That is all.

&gt;And no, ICOs do not give you equity or shares for putting up cash

Didn't say they did. I said usually ""startups"" give you equity or shares for putting up cash. Which is true in the world of business.

&gt;Have you participated in an ICO? 

Yes. What does that have to do with what you said?

&gt;If you have, you didn't give anyone cash. 

lol what? What do you think they dump the ETH for?

&gt;Don't blatantly mislead people.

What a majestic backpedal. Pure damage control man. Just don't. I'm not stupid.

&gt;The most important thing you aren't considering is the natural desire for the team to make more money

Oh brother. *This* argument again. Let me guess? The team wants to unlock the tokens because they get more money!? Wow it's fucking nothing man. They don't need the tokens. They payment is already being made. It's called financing a company debt-free and interest-free. Do you know how hard it is to get that much money to finance a company without giving up tremendous equity? Clearly you don't. 

&gt;and for the company who ""might someday possibly"" buy them out to also want to make more money by increasing the value of the token. 

The company that buys them out doesn't care about the token. They want the intellectual property, patents, and talent. That is all. The token itself is listed as a liability apparently. 

&gt;In that regard it does function similar to a stock (no, I'm not calling the modum token a stock, before you get all worked up), in that it represents the market's current and future ( but mostly future) sentiment as it relates to the value of the company and the work they are doing.

Are you actually that deluded, that you would equate the price of the Modum token to the potential profits being earned? Seriously? There is not one metric that would allow to even remotely calculate that.

Your attempt to tie it to big blue chip dividend stocks is ridiculous. Those stocks have *consistently* paid out dividends for years. They have stability and profitability. Huge market capitalization. Comparing the two is preposterous.

&gt;Greed, my friend, works both ways. There is nothing about this project that smells like an exit scam. 

Everything about it smells like an exit scam. If I was a shareholder in MOD, I would vote to sell the minute we got a great offer. I don't give a shit about the token holders. I have no legal responsibility to compensate them. I'm not liable for their contracts. 

&gt;They are too deeply involved with major universities and corporations. 

That means *nothing*. A partnership with a uni is a cheap way to get interns. A partnership with a corp is doing a proof of concept to potential buyers. The MOD token is not integral to ANY of this. 

&gt;They want to make money, and lots of it, and while there are plenty of hurdles, there's plenty of incentives too.

The smartest way to do that is to sell the company shares to the highest bidder at the best possible price. It has nothing to do with the token.

&gt;The main points you are making about not being guaranteed anything just seems moot when you're talking to people investing in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology startups (who utilize cryptocurrency in some way). 

Ah the ol' ""they're all scams, so this scam ain't bad"" argument. What a fallacy. There are other measures of success and integration is other cryptos. Wold you honestly compare MOD to ETH? Would you dismiss ETH so easily? This level of delusion for a coin sitting in the low 200's is completely insane. There are reasons it's there. It has nothing to do with ""marketing"" or ""quiet teams"". It's the token use case. It sucks. 

&gt;I'm trying to think of a single project that legally guarantees anything to anyone in terms of future values or payouts, and I can't, so I'm not sure why that's such an unusual risk in Modum's case, 

The amount of risk is not solely calculated based on your ability to receive payouts.... That's the use case for MOD. Which is low probability? Are you honestly implying that holding ETH or XLM is the same probability of failure? That would be...unwise. 

&gt;unless you just think it's a company without any promise - in which case, you are free not to invest, as with any other project you deem ""bullshit"" - to use your own words.

I dumped my MOD bags long ago. What's funny is how the Modum community seems to take basic facts so personally. Non-controversial facts. Things like ""You assume all counterparty risk"", ""The token is not a share"" and ""An exit scam is possible"".

&gt; Not only could I make that same argument, but I would make that same argument. But not only for Betconnek - for all cryptos.

K buddy. Everything has equal risk, compared to Betcoonnek. That's **insane**. 

&gt;If you think any of the cryptos you are invested in don't require your blind faith on future performance and good faith in their team, you are mistaken. But I think you know this. You aren't incompetent.

Blind faith? ETH is going to work whether I believe in it or not. So is XLM. There are powers way beyond my control that are determining those projects fates. They have arguably approached [Emergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence). Especially ETH and BTC. 

There is no reality, where you can dismiss any and all risk to cryptos, therefore they are all equal. That's not how this market works. 

&gt;I acknowledge that MOD is high risk.

You just spent two to three paragraphs telling me Modum was not risky compared to ""other cryptos"". You have no idea how to evaluate risk. 

 &gt;But high risk is relative. Is it high risk relative to bitconnect? or a United States-issued government bond? Everything in crypto is high risk. 

The fact that you don't have the ability to define different risks in different cryptos is a massive flaw in your abilities as a investor and a trader. That's not reality. There is no way the risks between BTC and DOVU, or ETH and DOGE are the same. None. Only a complete fool would believe that. 

&gt;Let's not get bogged down in subjective claims on what constitutes high risk. I think we can all agree cryptos are inherently high risk. Again, this doesn't seem noteworthy.

Cryptos are not all the same.

&gt;The 'toxic community' meme is tired now. There are bad apples in every bunch, 

The entire mod subreddit was brigadding /r/cc. The mods even said so. 

&gt;but I could also argue that there are easy ways to bring out the best and worst of people within any given community. I would, however, agree with you that this space has a lot of maturing to do, and it would be very beneficial for everyone here to take an entry level course on rhetoric.

You're not disproving anything. You're just adding to my argument that the investors of this token are immature and incompetent. 

&gt; I am not willing to make a blanket statement about the entire community, as you are, but I would say that Modum's investors are about average in terms of maturity (no offense, fellow modlers). I certainly didn't mean to dismiss any concerns about the project or token, nor did I make emotional ""arguments."" Hopefully I’ve remedied that to some degree with this response. I did share my thoughts and opinions, but emotional arguments? Eh.

You can't dismiss risk, and other happenings or possibilities based on ""teams"", ""partnerships"", ""feelings"" or ""potential"". Modum IS what it is. If variables were changed I might be it's biggest fan. It's the details that matter.

&gt;""The fact that MOD is not a share is it's biggest flaw."" Some see this as its greatest advantage. I'll just leave it at that.

Those people are for lack of a better word, stupid. Shares are a highly evolved financial product that has centuries of trust behind them. They work really really well. Notably in preventing things like I'm talking about from happening (exit scams, false promises, embezzlement). They ensure accountability, and compensation. Not promises and speculation. 

&gt;Lastly, you do a pretty good job sticking to the arguments that you create, but from an objective point of you, you surely must see how ...acrimonious (see what I did there...) you seem to be against the modum project. Perhaps you are just extremely misunderstood.

Perhaps I am. That's for you to decide. Frankly with the actions of other coins, I don't believe that upvotes or downvotes from a brigade is the truth in regards to what is *really* happening. 

The last thing I said in my post was ""invest wisely"".  I don't care that people invest in MOD. I care that they call it a share and think their investment is immutable.

&gt;If you are truly just pointing out some - no..all, of the risks you find blatantly obvious in modum's business model out of the kindness of your heart - I would like to speak for all of the modum community and say thank you and I apologize for seeing your passionate arguments for why we are crazy for investing in “bullshit” as mere diatribes, and not as the friendly risk reminders you meant them as. You've made your points very clearly.

This is all publically available information. I don't see why it's so controversial. Wait, I do. Because bagholders have a lot to lose just like any other investment, and use tactics like personal attacks, downvotes (suppression), and other tactics to try to discredit me. Someone even called me a TRON fan.

"decimals don't really matter. It's about consumer behavior due to perceived value of things. People will hold off unnecessary purchases because they think it'll be cheaper in the future due to deflation. Which causes a drop in consumption and demand on goods. Which means the price of those goods and services will drop contributing to even more deflation.

The only way to fix this (if you find another way you'll get the nobel price for economics) is to have a inflation between 2-3% per year. This is just enough that people don't hold out on purchasing goods and services and not high enough that it erodes purchasing power too much. It's not perfect but it's the best we've got.

Case in point. Do you know someone that genuinely buys products and services with crypto? Probably not due to the insane deflation they are having since early 2017.  ",1524528660

Wow. So why do crypto news sites have to publish whether their backers own Bitcoin?

It's because people who already own Bitcoin have a *conflict of interest*

Perhaps they are incredibly smart and see that Bitcoin is amazing and will take over the world **or** perhaps they bought it because they think laypeople are stupid and in the long run will buy tons of Bitcoin

both answers don't matter..

What matters is the fact that they *hold* Bitcoin. By default, they have a conflict of interest.

"I think it was clear I meant crypto startups. We are in a cryptocurrency sub aren't we? And no, ICOs do not give you equity or shares for putting up cash, b/c no one in the space uses cash. They use crypto. Have you participated in an ICO? If you have, you didn't give anyone cash. If you recall, they didn't give you equity either. They gave you coins/tokens. Don't blatantly mislead people.

The most important thing you aren't considering is the natural desire for the team to make more money, and for the company who ""might someday possibly"" buy them out to also want to make more money by increasing the value of the token. In that regard it does function similar to a stock (no, I'm not calling the modum token a stock, before you get all worked up), in that it represents the market's current and future ( but mostly future) sentiment as it relates to the value of the company and the work they are doing.  Greed, my friend, works both ways. There is nothing about this project that smells like an exit scam. They are too deeply involved with major universities and corporations. They want to make money, and lots of it, and while there are plenty of hurdles, there's plenty of incentives too.

The main points you are making about not being guaranteed anything just seems moot when you're talking to people investing in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology startups (who utilize cryptocurrency in some way). I'm trying to think of a single project that legally guarantees anything to anyone in terms of future values or payouts, and I can't, so I'm not sure why that's such an unusual risk in Modum's case, unless you just think it's a company without any promise - in which case, you are free not to invest, as with any other project you deem ""bullshit""  - to use your own words.  

Regulations have everything to do with this point actually. Regulators and their regulations hold the life and death of this entire nascent market in their hands, so it seems silly to disregard the role of future regulations in modum's case as well.  Sure, they have given themselves plenty of wiggle room, but again, those who are investing are doing so to at least some extent on good faith. It's totally understandable if you decide that's too much for your own risk tolerance level. As you so often point out, it’s all laid out in plain sight in their terms and conditions.

""You could use the argument to advocate investing in Betconnek. Worthless stuff."" Not only could I make that same argument, but I would make that same argument. But not only for Betconnek - for all cryptos. If you think any of the cryptos you are invested in don't require your blind faith on future performance and good faith in their team, you are mistaken. But I think you know this. You aren't incompetent.
 
I acknowledge that MOD is high risk. But high risk is relative. Is it high risk relative to bitconnect? or a United States-issued government bond? Everything in crypto is high risk. Let's not get bogged down in subjective claims on what constitutes high risk. I think we can all agree cryptos are inherently high risk. Again, this doesn't seem noteworthy.

The 'toxic community' meme is tired now. There are bad apples in every bunch, but I could also argue that there are easy ways to bring out the best and worst of people within any given community. I would, however, agree with you that this space has a lot of maturing to do, and it would be very beneficial for everyone here to take an entry level course on rhetoric. I am not willing to make a blanket statement about the entire community, as you are, but I would say that Modum's investors are about average in terms of maturity (no offense, fellow modlers). I certainly didn't mean to dismiss any concerns about the project or token, nor did I make emotional ""arguments."" Hopefully I’ve remedied that to some degree with this response. I did share my thoughts and opinions, but emotional arguments? Eh.  

""The fact that MOD is not a share is it's biggest flaw.""  Some see this as its greatest advantage. I'll just leave it at that.

Lastly, you do a pretty good job sticking to the arguments that you create, but from an objective point of you, you surely must see how ...acrimonious (see what I did there...) you seem to be against the modum project.  Perhaps you are just extremely misunderstood. 

If you are truly just pointing out some - no..all, of the risks you find blatantly obvious in modum's business model out of the kindness of your heart - I would like to speak for all of the modum community and say thank you and I apologize for seeing your passionate arguments for why we are crazy for investing in “bullshit” as mere diatribes, and not as the friendly risk reminders you meant them as. You've made your points very clearly.

"The complete misinformation about Tezos seen in other subs is baffling. Beta launch is literally 3-6 weeks out, and the platform is essentially complete and fully functional. Every core feature advertised is implemented, unlike the main gen 3 blockchains conpetitors such as ADA and EOS, which are complete husks. 

The community built through all the adversity and struggles we contributors have faced, is astounding, and unparalleled by anything except Bitcoin. A community organized foundation known as the Tezos Commons Foundation, was recently created, with a board that was democratically voted on by dedicated and active community members, myself being one of them. The Tezos Foundation that was hijacked by Johann Gevers and held hostage for months, with no funds being allocated to the developers during that time, was successfully taken back by the community itself after months of legal proceedings. Now Ryan Jesperson, a community member that spearheaded the initiative to take back control, is the president of the Tezos Foundation. To top it all off, the foundation has well over $1,000,000,000 to promote the growth of the Tezos ecosystem, which has been well underway even without the funds, thanks to the grassroots efforts of the community itself. 

Tezos is going to take the crypto world by storm this year, and just like the people that treated ethereum like a joke or a scam during its early days, the Tezos detractors will too be proven laughably wrong. ",1524526301

"The ATH was like 37, a high price would be 30, but nano could get to 40 again let's say, that is not the most insanely high and out to lunch prediction. So if you bought at 30 and it goes to 40 within 6 months, thats 25% profit in 6 months, 50% over 12 months, ""good or average"" in the stock market is 10% return, so buying nano at a high price would beat a decent stock market return by 50%, if everything works out and this turns into a bull run that is peaking around June. That is very optimistic but given the charts today, not necessarily impossible and we might not necessarily see the charts follow the same pattern year after year with a december bull run.

I think you are way too bearish right now, I don't see your obsession with lambasting a person who bought at the ATH, historically that is so idiotic and yeah OK, you don't even need to use nano as an example, people like you were criticizing people and calling them ""idiots"" for buying bitcoin at 1000 dollars, and you told them they would be bagholding forever.

You sell at the next all time high you encounter, right? That is how this works, ideally. Bitcoin historically has WAY higher prices than it's ever seen before.

"Any crypto can have zero fees, really. It's an economics decision to have them.

Bitcoin/ETH for example have fees to reward miners which do the PoW to validate transactions. With no fees, miners may still want to mine because of the block rewards (newly minted coins). The idea is that by offering more incentives, you can eventually get rid of block rewards and create a hard cap (in BTC's case) or it incentives a more diverse and larger mining pool which makes the network harder to attack.

Other coins like XRP/XLM that use a dBFT concensus system rely on a smaller pool of validator nodes for concensus. These nodes do not get the fees on each transaction, instead the fees are simply burned. This causes the value of the crypto to rise over time as coins because more scarce and these projects typically have a maximum supply, so no coins are ever minted. These projects can also raise and lower the fees as desired, such as punishing a network spam attacker by temporarily increasing fees.

So NANO has no fees. This isn't so much a technical achievement, it's really just an economics decision. Nano is similar to a dBFT concensus system in that there will be very few validator nodes which are not compensated, in theory they can be chosen by the Nano holders via a representation system but it practice this likely means exchanges, huge merchants, and official NANO reps will always have the Lion's share of voting power.",1524525688
"CoinEx exchange is already implementing BCH markets. 

It’s only a matter of time (timing is everything) until the bigger exchanges such as gdax, bittrex, poloniex etc.. implement BCH markets.

I don’t think you want to see the bigger exchanges implement BCH markets, that would lead to much more success for the Bitcoin Cash protocol. Don’t kid yourself, we know you don’t want to see that.",1524525619
"Block time. 

ETH has a block-time of 15 seconds, BCH is 10 minutes.

Ethereum is not trying to be a currency, so they didn't care about high orphan rates, which is what happens when you have an ultra-short block-time.

EOS is the new Ethereum competitor with sub 1-second block-times, but you can still make that scale when you've got a proof-of-stake system, not in a proof-of-work like ETH.

This is also why it's useless to suggest that BCH or BTC needs shorter block-times. All you need is zero-confirm to be working and you're fine.

10 minutes block-time is enough to do gigabyte blocks and likely terabyte blocks. Maybe 50 years from now we might actually increase the block-time to make even bigger blocks.

And this isn't even getting into the inherent centralizing effects of hard forks, such as how it breaks the promise made to people running old node software.

"in a nutshell, Valence hopes to solve a few problems of pre-existing dapp platforms: 1) reduce technological/transactional bloat seen in existing dapp platforms (for example, but not limited to, eliminating use of app specific tokens); 2) significantly reduce the technological barrier to entry to create a decentralized app (code agnostic, and in some simple use cases allowing for the use of a GUI to create an app in lieu of coding); 3) Ensuring true decentralization of Valence network nodes by making it financially infeasible for one person/entity to acquire enough nodes to control the network.

NavCoin will be the primary transactional currency on the Valence network; however, a future Valence app, NavChange, to be built by the NavCore team will effectively allow the transactions with many virtual currencies (ex: user pays with Nav, merchant receives Bitcoin).",1524521381

"Thank you; this is the absolute truth.

As a former BCH holder ; when I see BCH rise in value as it has this past week I was interested to investigate this sub to see what is going on that might be spurring the growth.

When I come here I see that about half, sometimes more, of the posts on the front page are about bashing Bitcoin in someway and continue trying to push the bold lie that Bitcoin and BCH are both forks; instead of just being honest.

BCH forked off the Bitcoin network when it created consensus breaking changes in the protocol. Nothing wrong with that; but trying to claim that they BCH is ""the real bitcoin"" is an outright lie. It is demonstrably false. I haven't updated my node since early 2017. Yet my node is still connected to the BTC network ; not the BCH network. I haven't migrated my funds to Segwit addresses; and have not had to use new wallet software. For me the soft fork into SegWit is essentially non-existent; yet I am still able to participate on the network.

In order to participate on the BCH network I need new node software, new wallet software. Thats what happens with a hard fork vs soft fork. It is a very important distinction that is purposefully glossed over here.

If it weren't for these sorts of dishonest tactics I'd be much more interested in BCH as an alternative scaling solution. As it stands right now I believe it is a scam, or at best that many people involved in BCH simply do not understand Crypto at all and just like to argue about things they are completely ignorant on.",1524519764

Absolutely nobody, but they are indeed in positions of power and they have been able to force through contentious changes with zero pushback because of it, see 1mb limit, RBF and lightning as the most obvious examples, but limiting op_return sizes and a thousand other cuts that contributed to the present death which it is suffering.

The indisputable truth is that core is actually a dictatorship of a very small group of people over everybody else, and their decisions are enforced no matter how objectively terrible they may be. Nothing would be objectively lost if BTC were to abandon proof of work altogether and allocate a proof of stake system based on representatives with all of the actual voting power assigned to this cabal of poisonous vipers. It would  be exactly the same product it presently is, just with hundreds of megawatts less energy wasted larping as if the POW actually meant something and the architecture matched Satoshi's vision of voting with hashing power rather than proof of cabal membership.

And this is why core coin will ultimately die. It's just another central bank.

Very true, if Blockstream didn’t cripple the blocksize in favor for a hub-and-spoke network, there would be no need for BCH, and BTC would be shining with market dominance &gt;50%.

Lol, your statement is far from the truth. BCH’s protocol/algorithm is almost identical to the original BTC that led to where the current BTC is today.

In fact, there are various mainstream platforms to obtain BCH. Since BTC is the main alt gateway, if/when more BCH/alt markets arise, you may see a significant change in transaction volume, followed by hash power. Due to the fact that if the BTC protocol remains as is, at some point it will be more feasible/economical to use BCH as a gateway to alts.",1524519163

"'The MOD token is not a share of a company.' 
This was never stated as being the case and I have yet to see a MOD holder argue this, anywhere.

'The MOD token does not guarantee any specific or minimum % of the profits generated by Modum. Those numbers are determined by the board.' 
Indeed. It’s almost like we chose to invest in a project based on trust in the team's background gained through personal research with no real certainty of future profit…

'Modum's ability to release profits to token holders is going to be hampered by the fact that they are required to save some of the profits, and profitability is difficult to achieve in the first several years. '
I would actually be pretty pissed off if the MOD team scrambled to disseminate profits in the first year to impatient holders, as opposed to reinvesting that profit into growing the company initially. Think most Modlers would agree.

'The MOD token does not give you shareholder rights or voting rights on anything besides locking/unlocking tokens in a vault'
 You are correct. This one is more subjective, based on how much control any given token-holder feels they should have. I’m all for ‘muh decentralisation’ but also in favour of a company being able to still function effectively without being hobbled by a legion of neck-bearded utopianist bellends crying after an inevitable delay at some point in the roadmap.

'If Modum sells their company (shares), there is no guarantee you will be compensated. Even vague citations of ""Swiss law"" can't guarantee that. '
Ctrl + V. It’s almost like we chose to invest in a project based on trust in the team gained through personal research with no real certainty of future profit… Also the CEO has stated multiple times (including in recorded situations) that in the event of a company sale token holders would be protected, to the extent of establish legal grounding for a solid Oral Contract.

'Even if you could seek damages, you will likely be seeking damages from a company that isn't Modum with a formidable legal team. Your buy in price will also be largely irrelevant. '
Ctrl + V applied to the majority of crypto.

'The Modum terms and conditions clearly state that you assume ALL counterparty risk. They've notified you that they are not liable for any contracts if they sell. '
Ctrl + V regarding Oral Contract.

'The MOD token is not essential to the function of Modum's business model, nor is it required in the block chain applications.' 
The token not being essential is a large part of its appeal for me. A blockchain-agnostic company combining the immutability of blockchain with a business model centred around ground-breaking technology not fettered by the problem of token adoption sounds just grand.

'Modum's shareholders do not require tokens to make money on the company' 
An interesting point, and I acknowledge the risk implied here.

'MOD was ranked #106 on CMC on October 29th, 2017 (after the ICO). It's now ranked #224.. MOD's price has barely risen 50% from that point.' 
MOD’s decline in rank has nothing to do with the company’s viability or legitimacy and everything to do with a complete lack of fucks given as it quietly completes pilot schemes, presents a leading EU supply chain events and signs partnerships. Today’s announcement throws MOD into the EU spotlight as a company in compliance with the GDP 2013 regulations ready to revolutionise the pharma supply chain. More will follow, and MOD has the EU first mover advantage ahead of AMB, WTC, VEN or any of the others.",1524518597

"It's pretty damn risky right now as far as getting a ROI. The difficulty of every coin seems to go up exponentially (except Monero which everyone mines now so it too is going up) and, unlike in December when everyone got excited about all things crypto, the price hasn't been keeping up with the increase in mining difficulty so, many times, your electricity costs are more than the coins you mine and that doesn't even include the costs of equipment. It's such a tight margin line now that whether or not you can be profitable right now really depends on how much you pay for electricity. If you are above about 6kw/h -  you might as well just buy some more coins. Go to coinwarz and plug in your numbers (i.e. what mining equipment you plan on buying, your electric costs etc.) and look at the numbers for yourself to decide if it is worth it for you. Chances are, unless you live directly beneath the sun and own tons of solar panels, it's going to be super hard to actually earn money. If you just want a hobby though, I guess that's a different story. If you don't care about losing a little money and just like the idea of mining, check out VoskCoin on youtube. ",1524518540

If crypto doesn't fall under the ""personal property"" rule (which it most certainly doesn't because it's intangible) and it falls under ""Special Rules for Gains From Dispositions of Certain Property"" you're gonna have a lot of crypto holders that moved to Puerto Rico, only to find they have to stay there for 10 more years before they can sell tax free, or they have to use Special Election and only the gain during the time after they became a PR resident is tax free.

The 'security' is provided by the BCH network, and the 'color' guarantees it is a valid part of their promotion.  basically a free-ish, non-counterfeitable gift card/loyalty program.

I think we're past the point of no return.  The signs of critical mass are people getting their salary in bitcoin, and major closed economic loops (store owner buys supplies using bitcoin and supplier buys goods from store using bitcoin. Fiat removed from the loop).

By contrast, in 2014 Bitcoin’s $1200 bubble had popped, gox had wiped out taking a bunch of the naive users with it.

Tax heavens do not work for US citizens, that's why all the big crypto players you hear about denounce their citizenship. Ex: Jeff Berwick, Roger Ver.",1524516717

Although I would argue that BCH more closely resembles the Bitcoin from pre-fork and from the BTC whitepaper, we lost the name Bitcoin in the fork split. Even though the reasons for losing the fork were because of censorship and misinformation, we still lost.

I do believe that the direction Blockstream is taking Bitcoin in is fatal, at least for the short term. But that doesn’t change the fact that we had to fork off and we were the minority chain. 

I’m happy that BTC has stuck to the small block ideology in the meantime though. It’s giving BCH tons of room to prove we were right and we already are. Bigger blocks are working great and the mentality of simply increasing the block size has a proven track record of years and years longer than diverting to an off chain solution. So I’m not worried. 

Blockstream played dirty and, in my opinion, is and will slowly lose ground as the truth reveals itself. ",1524515685

"Thank you for your response, I totally agree with a lot with what you are saying, Im trying to work through a new way of thinking for myself and find this discussion very valuable for what I want to pursue in Bitcoin.

I agree the price will continue to rise but Bitcoin is only deflationary when we all die in 2140.(none of us in this community will see Bitcoin in its deflationary state)  Mining awards decrease but its still inflation (in bitcoin).  We could only cause deflation today if someone controlled 100% of the hash power and never present the new coinbases to the rest of the network or we get verifiable destruction of existing coins that exceeds the remaining coins to be mined.
So considering that,

Whats stopping someone to price commodities at effectively $100K/BTC today and leave it there until it eventually happens for real?

I bring this up because i've been doing incredibly simple piece work for Bitcoin for years and i've just priced my time at $10k/btc throughout 2014 and on, losing considerable potential value but it wasn't why i picked up the piece work.  I was typically collecting $20 tasks for 200,000 satoshis (0.002, i got the math right, right?).

"Perhaps this isn’t the place for this but I see loads of nano fans about so perhaps I can be refuted. For some time nano has left me uneasy with how many people seem to think it is the future of peer to peer transfers. Only once have I ever seen pointed out what seems to be a glaring issue with regard to the future of nano and it came from one of the few people who probably should have left it for others to mention, an iota higher up.


I’ve only been watching the crypto game for about a year or so but I clearly remember raiblocks inception to the market. It was impossible to miss as the shill for xrb was so extreme. It would be near impossible to convince me that xrb entered the game without an organized, coordinated marketing (shill) effort. It was only on two (questionable) exchanges and the amount of obvious shill posts that sprung up so rapidly with such cliche comments and support was astounding. 


The great thing about nano is that as far as I can tell (I’ve not actually used it) is that it is a working product. Already it does what it promises and works perfectly by all accounts. Where I see an issue lies in their lack of vision and forward movement. The problem lies within the motto ‘do one thing and do it well.’ For that to be a successful model you must be doing something unique that no others can achieve or you must be doing that one thing better than anybody else. It also works if your market is trapped and forced to use your product but that’s not the case here. As soon as a competitor comes along and does your ‘one thing’ better (or equal) than nano it will lose its value. The moment people want a second feature with their peer to peer coin nano will not hold up. It only takes a competitor to do what nano has done + any desirable feature to be a superior option.


The Nokia 3310 was the best mobile phone I ever used to make a phone call, it did one thing and did it well. I use a smartphone now and I’ll bet you do too. It does more than one thing well.

"One day we will have a crypto currency which is mined by:

- having a unique device demonstrate personal freedom of movement over an area, for a mining rate based on pace and network interaction over the journey. A la Facebook

- having many unique devices specialized for different interactions, such as refrigerators, toasters, printers, desktops, whatever. They mine by performing their designed purpose. 

The second one interests me especially because I envision manufacturers warranties bring implemented through blockchain technology that will prove the devices history of operation to itself and only those permitted in the contract (particular information restricted to particular parties through subcontracts). Contracts could be multisig, consumer, merchant, government, manufacturer, distributors, anyone funding the payment channel. More importantly, contracts can have the mining (which is basically doing the hashes needed to post data to the blockchain, can be very light) reward function as the warranty.

 Mining reward is locked in the contract during operation. Leaving the product off does not necessarily take away from the warranty. While the product is in, it's operation is electronically validated and it's validation is sent to the blockchain. If no valid data is sent for a period set in the contract (a week?) Then the consumer could end the contract and begin it's dissolution. By returning the product with the mining reward, they pay the manufacturer indirectly once all parties agree to the dissolution. This may also mean that tax authorities and distributors get a share, but that would make this even easier on the end user depending on tax law and manufacturor return policy. The original payment, in its original form would be returned to the consumer at the end of the dissolution. Should happen over minutes if everyone is using DAOs. All the big boys will be though.

Anyways, the benefit of the mining appears to consumers who keep their devices past their warranty expiration. The rewards become unlocked, and converted to however many tokens the original purchase price would buy. 

This would not work for very short term instruments unless inflation is high. This is because most products generate much less than, like 20% their purchase price in a year. However electronics should last years. And they are highly versatile. Warranties should not be conservative estimates, they should be for a long time, with the manufacturer redeeming returned devices. They can make money from their own insurance programs. 

At the least, they have firm data on the history of their refurbished units.",1524514873

As far as the tech staff, before the ICO I remember reading about what they were going to do with the funds raised. I can't find it, but they said they were going to be hiring staff.

I don't think you're wrong to be asking the questions. I don't think they're as weak of a team as you think, but definitely not the strongest team out there. That being said, the prices on BABB are still very low, so there is some great risk/reward. For me, I love their mission and I hope they succeed, that's why I bought some tokens. Hopefully I'll make a bunch from it, but if not, and the company improves people's lives that really need it, then I'll still be extremely happy. To me, that risk/reward is worth it.

I do believe in the team, and I believe they will likely be the first blockchain/crypto company with a legit banking license. If they do that, and get some partnerships with the Central banks, the price will rise. Then it will be a matter of when they can launch their app, and then get widespread adoption/usage.

I sent my money to Coinbase on 8th Feb (2018). The money disappeared so I logged an incident with Coinbase and also telephoned them.

So that's the level of 'service' Coinbase offer when they lose your money: sorry, our bad; we'll sort it out for you within six months; meanwhile, tough luck. 

On 20th April I got an e-mail from Coinbase. Basically, they stated that it was my fault that my money went missing (although I've sent them money previously in exactly the same way, and it worked). They added that they'll put the money back in my bank account (not my Coinbase account) within 48 hours.

I checked my bank account next day and they have indeed put my money back in there.

Thanks to the Reddit crypto community for reading and tolerating our tax articles and for the feedback. I’ve got some good investing tips and topics to come over the next few weeks now that tax season has passed. Much more fun and educational topics. 

Thanks for reading and supporting our new site. Feel free to leave us feedback there. As we’ve stated many times, we’re not trying to replace Reddit’s great crypto subs. We just want to supplement them with content and a little more focused discussion from a mainstream investor point of view with less emphasis on the technical side of crypto. We started with taxes because I found the info out there to be a little misleading and possibly even dangerous. I come from a background of successful stock market investing although I am neither a financial planner nor tax accountant. 

The tax info we provided probably didn’t endear us/me to the crypto community at large. I promise I have better topics in the works. :)",1524513553

"&gt; The most helpful thing actually would be to enable BTC users to exchange to XMR with your service.   
   
We're not excited by the prospect of accepting wildly-considered, provably dirty coins. And nor by the idea of filtering incoming bitcoins ourselves (or paying third party to do so) with the fear of ending up with the hot potato.   
Unlike bi-directional stuff like shapeshift, we never receive BTCs from random people as we only accept XMR. Which means we will never send dodgy BTC to you either.   
This concept of ""tainted"" coins does not exist with Monero.   
   
In general *fungibility* rules, and it makes a tremendous difference as a business. We are perfectly happy accepting Monero only for the peace of mind it gives us.   
Note that fungibility closely relates to privacy, and the fact that we only accept Monero also protects the privacy of our customers along with our peace of mind. If you do not care about privacy and only want to convert not-fungible X to coin Y, we are probably not the best business for you because we are very aware of the risk and burden it would put on us.",1524513003

For a coin like vertcoin that doesn't have much traffic on its network to begin with, something like lightning is cool but also largely unnecessary because theres no need for it really. Perhaps in the future if it got widely adopted than it would be useful. But is vertcoin's improvements upon btc large enough to actually get to that point?

"**Thoughtcrime**

A thoughtcrime is an Orwellian neologism used to describe an illegal thought. The term was popularized in the dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell, first published in 1949, wherein thoughtcrime is the criminal act of holding unspoken beliefs or doubts that oppose or question Ingsoc, the ruling party. In the book, the government attempts to control not only the speech and actions, but also the thoughts of its subjects. To entertain unacceptable thoughts is known as crimethink (or wrongthink) in Newspeak, the ideologically purified dialect of the party.

Zimbabwe has a fascinating currency system right now where both USD and Zimbabwe bond notes (which are supposedly pegged to USD) are in use, although USD is officially the currency and bond notes technically only represent USD and are not an official currency.

This has led to a two tier system where stores have two prices, one in dollars, one in bond notes, as there is little confidence bond notes will retain their value (although they have so far avoided hyper-inflation). Banks have also been resorting to handing out deposits in coins instead of notes since there's a shortage of notes.

"If you have &lt;$500 in crypto then I really don't see how spending $60-$100 on a HW wallet is justified.  For most people with investments that small, it's ""screw around"" money anyway and losing it won't be devastating financially.  And if $500 *is* a life-changing amount of money, why the hell are you investing it in crypto? 

I have less than $500 invested and keep all my coins on desktop wallets.  Yeah it isn't the most secure storage method, but as long as the user has good safety practices it's pretty good. ",1524511776

It will be eventually.  It's a superior form of money.  Do you expect fiat will grow in popularity vs Bitcoin?  Governments and banks can only hold it back for so long.  The network effect of Bitcoin leads to exponential acceleration once a critical mass is achieved.  It will be quite dramatic to witness when it happens.,1524511671
"To be fair, it was not only the ""core dev team"" that was saying that.  

Also, there is not really a ""core dev team"" that can be quoted saying such things. There is a Bitcoin Core Github repository and a loose, undefined group of people contributing to it, without commonly articulated goals or statements and without some kind of defined membership, status etc.  
So to say the ""dev team"" has been saying something particular is not entirely correct, although I guess not entirely wrong either. ",1524511667

How much does IHOP spend every transaction for credit card purchases? (Typically both a flat fee PLUS a percentage)...

No, not worse in almost every single way, not by a longshot.

Toxoplasmosis parasites live and reproduce in cat guts. 
Cats poop out parasites.
Rats eat this infested cat poop.
Rats behave erratic, being less scared of cats.
Cats catch and eat infected mice. Parasites re-enter cat guts, and are happy.

The extended theory was that by mining bitcoin, cat owners were creating an environment suitable for cats.
Happy cats = happy cat guts = happy parasites.
Additionally, the scientist postulated that the crazy price fluctuations of cryptocurrencies were also motivated by the parasites - keeping traders and miners glued to their screens makes them forget to empty litter boxes, increasing likelihood of toxoplasmosis re-exposure.

Throwaway supporting evidence: crypto-kitties",1524511554

From my feeling, its maybe    
50% pro-BCH content,    
40% BTC content (calling out BTC)    
and 10% troll / spam posts.    

I think what people often forget is the fact, that Bitcoin Cash is in the position to justify itself.    
""why does Bitcoin Cash even exist?""    
""why you say that BCH is better than BTC?""    
stuff like this is a permanent topic all over the place.    
Which means that **of course** the Bitcoin Cash community has to point out flaws of BTC and strengths of BCH.    
**The only reason why BCH exists in the first place is, that BTC failed to achieve the goals that a lot of early Bitcoiners had.**     
Which means the comparisson between BCH and BTC is necessary.    
Sure - there are some seriously low-level insults and aggressive attacks out there from time to time against BTC, but lets be realistic:    
compared to the cencoring at the Bitcoin subreddit + the MASSIVE amounts of BTC trolls, constantly attacking Bitcoin Cash, its really a low level of attacks here.    
keep in mind:

Lighning is a fully centralized network, which essentially defeats Bitcoin's decentralization by putting the network on which it runs under the control of those who did not like that they didn't used to have control of Bitcoin, so defeating another tool that's not playing by TPTB's rules by making it run on Lightning would set the world back from progress it's made in the last few years even more.

Do you think it's over?  Bitcoin Cash has just begun. 

Since after all this deliberation you've finally shifted into neutral, I actually recommend lurking for a while before admonishing our long time community members.  You will find that this community is not neutral at all.

Maybe try again at 1,000,000 per coin. Maybe I'll sell you some then. ;) ",1524511320
"I am right there with you... I ask knowing full well they don't.

It's like they want to put themselves behind bitcoin...,1524510999
"Damn straight man. I love bitcoin, I love blockchain, and I am sure that they will be integral to the future of business. However, they must be stable. Unfortunately, bitcoin will not see stability unless there are huge changes to its protocol that would necessitate such a hard fork that it would really no longer be bitcoin, it would be 2.0. While I see this as a possibly, bitcoin has value in not being stable. With the design of its deflationary protocol, even though it will still be liable to huge downward price movements, it may continuously move in the upward direction. Relatively fine for bitcoin, and it would continue to have value, but it would not instill it as the most effective exchange commodity.

A stable coin needs a protocol that acts as a price regulator in itself in order to maintain decentralization. Basecoin is the leader in this model and I would highly recommend keeping a keen eye on them over the next decade. There are tons of models for stability, but after doing a research project on the options, it seems clear that Basecoin has the best protocol. The only thing they are missing is mass adoption, which is a problem for all cryptos, but would actually stabilize the price of Basecoin instead of shoot it upwards only to still be liable to heavy volatility.

My paper then offered the solution of a global tax body that collected taxes from privileged things (such as the airline ticket taxes in France or a million other) and then uses them to help disadvantaged countries, which is a positive for them but also every economy offering the taxes. It is often discussed in global policy because of these huge moral and economical benefits, but the main issue is corruption, which makes it hard to bring to full benefits of the taxes, much less actually track them. It would be rife with issue that make it currently infeasible. Cryptocurrencies offer tons of solutions here. Moreover, a global tax forum would add consistent and huge demand for a stable coin, which is the one thing they lack to be effective. I wonder if basecoin or any of the prominent figures in global policy and justice have considered this. If not I feel kinda cool to have had a novel idea, but even more distressed that it isn't being discussed.",1524510988

"&gt; Now if you want it absolutely right now for political/ideological reasons, I respect that, but this is not driving our business decisions.

Definitely not. I'm more concerned about the privacy aspect at the moment. 

The most helpful thing actually would be to enable BTC users to exchange to XMR with your service. Right now Shapeshift charges around ~$4 to convert, when in reality network fees are only about $0.50-$1.00 tops. Similarly other exchanges like Binance and others charge ridiculous fees to exchange. 

Hopefully, once bulletproofs are implemented those fees will come down. But it would be refreshing to see a service like XMR make a practical BTC+BCH gateway to XMR for more privacy focused users while privacy doesn't exist on BTC and BCH. ",1524510902

Example:  *fast* in italics.  designers often use that slant in logos:  [logo-1](https://seeklogo.com/images/F/fast-and-furious-energy-drink-logo-02D039854B-seeklogo.com.png), [logo-2](https://wholesomeireland.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Turbo-Fast-Logo.jpg), [logo-3](https://www.brandcrowd.com/gallery/brands/pictures/picture13512669113554.jpg), [logo-4](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/61/9c/bd/619cbd67ced708d30e91170d69cbcff9.png).

Bitcoin is upgraded by forks.

To answer your question, yes the hard fork/patch has been implemented into all of the existing teams' clients (ABC, BU, XT). There are other changes that can be patched in that do not alter consensus rules, an example of this is the CashAddr address format, this didn't need to be forked in because it simply translates the old format to the new without changing any consensus rules.

" The rule-of-thumb in crypto is to DYOR. All the people in this article saying things like:

&gt; The only truly private coin is Monero. If you don't want to use that then bad luck I'm afraid. 
and
&gt; The best privacy coin for us libertarians? It was monero 

[have not done their research.](https://wired.com/story/monero-privacy/).

&gt;**Those privacy flaws were especially acute before a change to Monero's code in February of 2017, the researchers note.** But transactions before that time **remain dangerously identifiable**, and even payments after that change may be easier to identify than **Monero's privacy-sensitive users might think.** ""The mental model that people have today for Monero is a simplistic one, **that these transactions are private. That model is just incorrect**,"" says Andrew Miller, a researcher at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who worked on the paper. ""There's information that’s revealed and not covered up by Monero's cryptography."" Miller is also an advisor to Zcash, another cryptocurrency that promises privacy protections.

Don't listen to their unofficial/official responses that will merely downplay the seriousness of these exploits.

&gt;""People took the privacy guarantees of the currency at face value,"" says Nicolas Christin, a dark web focused researcher who contributed to the paper. ""All indications show people were really using this for applications where they needed privacy. **And those transactions were very, very vulnerable.**""

Most people are unaware that Monero's privacy doesn't really work.

&gt;Before a recent change from Monero's developers, **that timing analysis correctly identified the real coin more than 90 percent of the time, virtually nullifying Monero's privacy safeguards**. After that change to how Monero chooses its mixins, **that trick now can spot the real coin just 45 percent of the time—but still narrows down the real coin to about two possibilities, far fewer than most Monero users would like.*

If you want a truly decentralized privacy coin, use Dash or use PIVX, ZCash if you don't mind the 20%. Dash uses coinmixing (so does monero in a sense but in a clumsy, inefficient way) that has removed the inefficiencies and limitations of coinjoin on BTC/BCH. With BCH, in order to do coinjoin you currently have to:

1. trust a 3rd party with your coins
2. trust a 3rd party to mix your coins (without tracing you)
3. trust a 3rd party to not be agents (1, 2 and 3 are separate but related concerns)
4. find sufficient liquidity

With Dash 1-3 are solved and 4 is now a non-issue as there are enough people mixing generally to get the job done within hours, especially at larger amounts. Dash relies on decentralized, randomly selected masternodes to handle the mixing. The coins never leave your control and multiple rounds are required by default (2 at least but at least 4 is best practice imo). 

It is nearly free while monero's avg fee is 2 USD for one transaction, which makes churn prohibitively expensive for small-medium amounts. PIVX is similar, but PIVX's privacy is a little beneath Dash's because it is still vulnerable to timing attacks. Not nearly as badly as monero is, currently 45% sender traceability,   but PrivateSend is immune to timing analysis. It seems to be the only privacy coin that is. Check it out.",1524509773
"&gt; From here forward BTC became controlled by Blockstream-paid developers. 

This is proven to be an untrue assertion. It can be verified easily by checking the number of contributors and contributions in the public source repository. If you like to read details about the real contributors, find an analysis e.g. here:

"Every coin has their own format.   Bitcoin addresses start with 1 and 3.   Since Bitcoin Cash forked from Bitcoin our addresses also started with 1 and 3. 

So you could send to the wrong chain and lose your coins forever.  Other coins like Dash starts with X and other coins start with different characters.   Also the number of characters is another defining characteristic.  

With cashaddr bitcoin cash has their own format.  Its clean and has other benefits _(I don't understand them)_ but to me the main one is that you absolutely cannot send bitcoin cash to bitcoin if using cashaddr",1524509723

They had one in November, now again in May.

This alternative transaction format could use the work done in https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin, which is the best implementation so far of the famous MimbleWimble proposal. Thus, it would work like a bidirectional inner chain embedded inside Bitcoin Cash. This seems the best solution to me, because it keeps the currently working system compatible, and only who wants to use strong anonymization would need to adapt their systems.",1524509475

"&gt;How can someone prevent 2nd layer implementation on BCH?

&gt;No one can... but that's not the point.

No true.

&gt;The point is that this is a discussion about the feasibility of on-chain scaling. On-chain only.

You argued that BCH is only on chain scaling somehow.

That false and I corrected you.

&gt;So he, and you in this case, must defend on-chain scaling as the only way to scale. 

Not the only way but as a possible way to scale which small blocker has decided is impossible.

&gt;If we find that on-chain doesn't work, THEN I'm more than happy to discuss off-chain scaling. But we must first answer the question: Can on-chain scaling work for global adoption and for as long as PCs are around? (Say 100yrs.) If the answer is yes, then you don't need off-chain. 

I disagree offchain can be needed even if onchain scaling is successfull.

I leave it to the market to decide whatever solution is optimum for each use case.

&gt;You are representing the entire sub in this case, and if you are honest, r-btc has been shitting on LN for ever.

Yes, IMO it is a rather ugly solution but beyond my opinion any “miracle” unproven solution should be treated with skepticism until proven.

And remain to prove if it can bring any scaling benefit to BTC.

Though if it prove to be beneficial in some use case then it is welcome on BCH too.


&gt;My node won't accept anything but the fully valid UTXO set, and valid transactions. Key point is that my node doesn't ""accept"" anything, because it validates everything. So I'm only accepting the raw txs (or blocks), the rest is validated.

You said you node/SPV can be sybilled by nodes with a fake chain/ UTXO set.

It takes an immense amount of hash power to produce a fake chain.. even for a few blocks.

A full node can’t protect you much from such attack because the attacker having access to such amount of processing power can just as well sybil your nodes a alternative chain of a few valid blocks, an alternative chain with for example missing transaction. 

in such case even full node will be fooled.


&gt;2nd layer solutions are bound by physical limit too. (If decentralised, they will scale poorly too)
That's quite an interesting claim... an implicit admission that decentralized systems scale poorly! And that's true regardless of the size of blocks.

It is true, 

Nobody denies there is some challenge scaling onchain.

But Certainly MUCH, MUCH more is possible than 1MB.


&gt;It also remain to rpove Actually, you cannot in complete honesty claim that big blocks somehow make the already poor scaling better, can you? If anything, it makes things worse as there's more data being pushed around this distributed network.

Yes but that doesn’t mean it can’t scale to much higher throughput than now.

&gt;Decentralization + Scale: That's off-chain, L2 solutions like LN. You sacrifice consensus (as in, not everyone on the network will agree to the exact state, which is obvious if we open a channel as no one except for the two of us knows how much money we've exchanged), but you remain decentralized and have scale. 
And I'm more than happy to embrace this.

That’s interesting, It seems that theorem is flawed.

Otherwise LN will be infinitely scalable and so far LN has immense scalability challenge.

Look at Routing and Hub liquidity.

But yeah payment channel between Alice and Bob can scale to Billions TPS, maybe that the case your theorem describe and routing represent a “consensus” (the whole network has to agree on a “map”)


&gt;That’s what BCH will do.
All scaling solutions should be allowed.
Se comment above. But to add one more thing... since most of this is being pushed on Bitcoin, how will it happen on BCH? 

Copy and paste.

&gt;Will you just copy/paste/adapt the code built by Core &amp; friends?

Yes why not?

&gt; I know it's all open source, but that's also extremely hypocritical.

Why?

We are not the one that has chosen to stick with arbitrary low limit.

&gt;First shit all over Core (and you know this is what r-btc does all. the. time.) and then leech off the code?

The problem is not the code, the problem is the 1MB… (and RBF… )

It would be hypocritical if we implemented the 1MB, RBF back on BCH.. but the rest, why not take it what serve BCH?

(actually BCH dev already did and I support that, why limiting yourself when the code is available?)

&gt;but all I see is a TON of research done for Bitcoin, and not very much for BCH.

What about Gigablock testnet, terablocks, graphene?

&gt;And here I'm talking academic research, 

Why specially academic research?

&gt;like Bulletproofs to anonimize transactions. Which I'm absolutely positive BCH would love as well. But without the research by the most hated person on r-btc, yes... Greg Maxwell (and friends), this ain't gonna happen. You need to acknowledge this.

Bulletproof might be implemented or not, this doesn’t really matter to me,

Hiding amont doesn’t do much for privacy, the most important was to increase block size and keep the cost of TX low enough for use case to come back (yours.org, joystream, memo, etc..) **returning to the fundamental** was critical, the rest is a bonus.

&gt;As much as he may not be a model citizen, and I have no idea if he is or not, he's doing tremendous work on Bitcoin (and hence every other blockchain out there). And yet, shit is all he's getting on r-btc. Can you see how it all comes across very hypocrytical??

He actively participate at steal bitcoin from us? why do you expect we somehow love him back?

But again we fork every 6 months, so why not bulletproof on BCH? I don’t mind, people use it if they need it…

I'll be honest: I really do not care if the miners consolidate and bitcoin becomes centralized; Im going to make money (probably more money) if this happens and honestly I see it as an inevitablility. Most people who believe in bitcoin however are very against the idea of centralization (e.g. the new bank is the old bank) and if you dont want centralization of bitcoin you should be very concerned about this issue because it will become a problem down the road.",1524508269

"&gt; Once upon a time Segwit had less than 30% of miner support. At that time, a comprise was made: raise the blocksize to 2mb and Segwit would be included. Developers were working together for once to advance BTC.

The first compromise (HK agreement) was weasel words from a handful of Core devs pretending they were speaking on behalf of the developer community. They never actually promised to deploy or activate a blocksize increase, just to write some code. 

The second compromise (NY agreement) had nothing to do with any of the Core developers and many of them spoke out as soon as it was published to say that it was a terrible idea and they wanted nothing to do with it.

&gt; As a result, most of the prolific and older Bitcoin developers left after they were lied to and disrespected (some had left before then).

I’m not aware of any major contributor who left Core after SegWit2x failed. Gavin, Jeff, Mike had all effectively left years before. They all worked on alternative block-size increasing implementations years before. So I’m not sure who you are referring to here?

&gt; Segwit isn't even necessary for the Lightning Network to exist. Many saw it as a pointless and overly complex addition.

On occasion nullc (and possibly others) argued that SegWit wasn’t necessary for LN in the most literal “technically accurate” sense that they could theoretically make LN work without fixing transaction malleability. But in the more sensible pragmatic sense SegWit *was* necessary for LN to work. 

&gt; From here forward BTC became controlled by Blockstream-paid developers. BTC, in its current form, is a centralized coin controlled by people who are paid by a company that took 70+ million from the legacy banking industry. 

The Blockstream devs had been dominating discussion and decision making around Bitcoin Core for literately years before the events you are describing. That’s why Gavin and Mike had tried to get Bitcoin XT in place back in 2015. 

You’re right to be suspicious when private companies with huge amounts of capital are using that money to influence developers, control projects, and generally manipulate the direction things move in to their own advantage. Lucky that there isn’t any company like that involved in BCH, huh?

If all the miners colluded, changed the clients, and started creating money out of thin air by spending money that doesn't exist - let's say spend 2BTC from an address that only has 1 - This would be hashed no problem, and included in the Merkle tree also no problem. The blockchain on its own does NOT prevent this, it's the validating nodes that reject this kind of txs. So if miners were to include this, you would never be able to tell a valid UTXO set from an invalid one, i.e. one that contains invalid txs.

Merkle trees are extremely powerful, but they are NOT all that is required to validate OR bootstrap the UTXO set. If they were, we would not even need to be shipping all the blocks around, the Merkle trees would be enough.


&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Look at the LN, it's still just a ""fuzzy idea"" but Core decided to shut down the debate while simultaneously putting all it's eggs in that basket, without a plan B, so how's that working out?

LN is **NOT** a fuzzy idea... LN has a White Paper that has been peer reviewed about a million times, and has been assessed to work. And the current implementations are showing that it's a lot more concrete than a *fuzzy idea* - It's been built, and it works. Yes, it can be improved, and it will be improved, but we have a working LN in place.

As for plan B... it's pretty obvious, increase block size. If all else fails, that is. That doesn't require any effort, it's literally a 5min job for any of the more experienced Core devs.

&gt;Everything starts out as a ""fuzzy idea,"" then those ideas get tested, sometimes by debate, then they get tried, and then if they work plans are made to get them implemented.

Yes, I know that. And that's fine, on its own. When this is NOT fine is when **the future of money depends on it**. You are pushing on the pedal to go as fast as you can based on ""somebody will come up with a way to slow things down"". Maybe... but what if they don't? That's not a sound business plan. At least not a business plan I will ever support.

If there are real solutions to address the problems I talked about, put them out there for review. I promise you fame and riches, if they are watertight. But as I said in my post above, I can't see anything. All I see are fuzzy ideas and wishful thinking. I know this generally works in business (are you a business consultant??), where most of the tech problems have already been solved and it's just a matter of putting them together to be successful. But here we are pushing the boundaries of CS+cryptography, it's **not at all guaranteed** there is an answer as we'd like to have it. Reminds me of physics... Stephen Hawking was saying we'd get to the end of theoretical physics by the 2000s, or so. We ""only"" have to do quantum gravity. As someone who is following this stuff with passion, trust me, we just as far as we were 40yrs ago. 

Fuzzy ideas are not a good business plan for the future of money.

"This story is absolutely true. I was around when the QT alert system was removed and this was the stated justification: since Gavin had relinquished repo control, he could theoretically become compromised and the alert system to which he held a key could be abused - also, there was the issue of Satoshi's disappearance and he had a key too. The system was intended to be used to announce any upgrade hardfork, and the devs had decided at this point that a hardfork was too risky, so the whole alert system was simply removed. It was fairly sensible, since it was designed and intended as a centralized bootstrap system and Bitcoin had grown well beyond the 'garage tinker' phase.

Interestingly, when the keys were disabled, the process was done according to the originally designed method of doing so. An alert message was signed with the highest possible alert serial number - indicating that *any* other alert message would necessarily be invalid and thus the alert system itself was no longer useful and the only way to get alerts would be to upgrade immediately. Clients got this alert and did as they were designed: instructed users to upgrade to a new (and alert-free) version. I'm not sure that clients still supporting the alert system will even follow the main chain today.",1524505544

Well it was already hacked by a 15 year old a few months ago.  Linux support has never worked for me using one of the major Linux distributions despite setting up permissions exactly as they say and dealing with their support on it.  I've been forced to use Windows with it which I don't want to do because of all of the additional security exploits inherent with Windows but even using Windows I haven't been able to access my wallets for days at a time.   Last time they updated software it took me a week before it would work.  I literally tried a hundred times a day to update and it failed for 3 days in a row and then tried it the next day and it just worked.  I believe it's because they can't handle the traffic on their network when a new release is out and everyone is trying to update.  Overall I don't think it works 100% like it's supposed to and there are more technical issues then I want form something that is shilled as being the Fort Knox of crypto ,1524505422

"I'm not saying you are wrong, but what you propose is debatable. Most ""professional"" traders have no problem trading legacy markets, but they aren't experienced (or used to, rather) in trading such high volatility markets. Add to the fact that crypto vs. legacy markets is basically a modern WW3 atm, with crypto being the inevitable winner, it won't take long for these ""professional"" investors, brokers, bankers, etc. to realize ""ytf am I trading for this old fart when I can totally just make my own wealth here"", especially once banks become even more threatened. 

Part of the problem I find is that a lot of people are too scared to say ""no"" to these ultra-wealthy folk. No single human on this planet needs a net-worth north of 100 billion dollars. It is actually detrimental to society. If this doesn't change, modern society will collapse. So no, don't buy into the belief that a single human owns you and with certainty will take everyone else's money. I will take this fuckers money because I am able to make the markets work for me. there are 1000's of others just like me also ready to take this fuckers money.

"Coinbase's merchant services [will stop accepting payments](https://medium.com/@coinbasecommerce/upgrading-the-merchant-experience-d97679274c71) in 7 days, on 30th April. Any vendors that has used this service will no longer accept Bitcoin payments.

Their replacement, Coinbase Commerce released in Feb 2018, had its [API documentation released](https://medium.com/@coinbasecommerce/announcing-the-coinbase-commerce-api-75f917f7eed9) on 3rd April, giving developers 4 weeks to integrate and release any new payment flow.

The Coinbase merchant service was not perfect, it didn't support crypto other than BTC, the reports had a lot to be desired, but it allowed business to accept BTC as payment without having to be concerned about storing BTC, as it could be converted to USD immediately (or partly). A vendor could sell a product for $10, the customer could pay in BTC, but the vendor has $10 credited to their USD account.

Coinbase Commerce cannot do this (yet?). While this may be fine for many small business accepting BTC that just want to hold, it probably isn't the case for any larger merchants. BTC payments can be accepted but are just put into a wallet. They cannot be sold or withdrawn without 3rd party software, and cannot be converted to USD without manual intervention. The Commerce UI is very simplistic, no search, no reports and no way to process refunds.

Commerce does accept more than BTC, which is a welcome change, adding BCH, LTC and ETH. When a charge is created, prices for each of these cryptos are calculated and the merchant can offer these are payment options. The user has a 15-min window to get the transaction broadcast and wait for the required number of confirmations.

Commerce also now uses a shared seed, allowing vendors to have control of their wallets. While desirable for anyone wanting to hold onto the crypto, it is of limited benefit to merchants that auto-sell.

The new solution also provide plugins into 3rd platforms such as Shopify to enable these websites to accept crypto payments.

I run a service that uses the current Coinbase merchant service for BTC, as well with Bitpay, and also accept other crypto using another provider. The Commerce integration has just been finished in order to be able to continue to accept BTC. 

We also use Bitpay. Since they added their [new payment protocol](https://blog.bitpay.com/bitpay-and-payment-protocol/) we have seen a decrease in usage of that method, which we assume is because of the lack of native support from wallets, especially hardware wallets like Trezor and Ledger.

Coinbase support recently told me that ""most of our users don’t ever convert to fiat"". As a merchant, this surprises me. There is a large additional effort required to track and declare unconverted crypto income, as well as the need to track basis and potential capital gains/losses, along with the risk of losing money while the payment is stored as crypto.

Commerce doesn't seem quite ready to provide merchant services and is a step backwards as to what we currently have.

Pros: 

- can accept multiple crypto
- has shared ownership of wallet seed
- easy to integrate into existing platforms, e.g Shopify

Cons:

- simple UI
- no reporting
- lack of details on payment view (e.g no metadata)
- no search or filtering
- no automatic full/partial payout
- cannot transfer crypto without 3rd party software

I have no idea on their plans with Commerce. It does seem like they are starting from scratch and hopefully the things above will be addressed over time.

For now, be aware that merchants accepting BTC using Coinbase are going to either stop accepting or change how they work. Even Reddit recently [announced stopping BTC payments](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/86lose/did_reddit_remove_bitcoin_as_a_payment_option_for/dw6ogr0/), partly because of the Coinbase change.

"Portfolio realtalk time. I have, as a result of being an OCD crazy person over the past crazy 3 months, created my own crypto pseudo-index fund.

My organization is fairly simple. I am thinking in terms of a 5 year (ish) HODL plan, but with rebalancing (or profit taking) as the market demands.

**Breakdown**:

* Low Risk: 28%
* Medium Risk: 43%
* High Risk: 29%

I have it broken down in my own spreadsheet further by token/coin type but there is room to disagree on categories so let's call it that. 

Here is my breakdown of the above, within each category in no particular order. ""Success"" means the token significantly rising in value. 

**Low Risk** (50% chance of success):

* BTC
* ETH

**Medium Risk** (25% chance of success):

* XRP
* EOS
* ARK
* ICX
* BAT
* OMG
* REP

**High Risk** (high likelihood all fail, but optimistic/wish-casting/unicorn dreaming about 10% chance of success, i.e. one of these will hopefully pan out):

* UTN
* LINK
* QSP
* REQ
* NANO
* LIF
* ETHORSE
* ELIXIR
* EVE
* ELEC

I have thoughts on all the above. Some category reorganization could be warranted, for instance some of the high risk could be medium risk. Certainly plenty of room for disagreement on what is in there vs. what is missing. Note distinct absence of most top 20 market cap coins for example. Interested in your thoughts.

You are correct my good man, It makes me happy that more folks are seeing the truth...keep learning, like all of us. The world is about to change very fast...with or without the relics approval. There is 200 Million South Americans that are sprinting to learn how to use BTC. This requires no approval from Wall St.

"I think you are confusing technology, with storage types.

Like, people might make a brand new app that solves peoples food choice. Cool, thats new tech.

Blockchain is ONLY the database and writing to the database.

We have centralized mysql databases, mongo databases, and much larger databases used for things like amazon.

Blockchain is a public database of transactions that require verification from many computers.

Its kinda like saying- Blockchain is the next AC current, when the reality is most AC current is used as a sine wave. Sure there are times you want different applications of AC, but 99% of the time, you should use what is already in the wall(current database systems.

My point is, even with smart minds, the uses seem almost non-existant. Bitcoin is great because we need the verification. voting applications is great, because we need the verification. Logistics might work well, but it would be very expensive over traditional logistic tracking methods.",1524503688

"agree on the first statement, not on the second.  no one ""invests"" in bitcoin to avoid inflation.  it's a competing currency whose value is determined by supply/demand for a currency, whether by actual adoption or by speculation, which surely we have had much of.  you are making it sound as if it was something as simple as TIPS, which it's not, and no one buying or using it is pretending it to be.

if someone simply wanted to ""avoid inflation"" they would be best off in TIPS or gold for a while, the former by design to preserve purchasing power and capital and the latter in current monetary use to do the same.

meanwhile bitcoin under increasing market adoption would be expected to grow in purchasing power.  it would be adopted by people looking for a way to avoid taxes, or settle transfers more quickly, or avoid merchant fees, or participate in a dark market, or opt in to a currency government has little ability to control.

or it could be purchased to speculate in, in which case there's just as much a chance it goes down as it goes up.

in all cases if your purpose was to 'avoid inflation' the safe bet is not bitcoin - it's buying TIPS, or a bar of gold, or a barrel of oil.  bitcoin carries plenty of risk.

americans have had rather little inflation as of more recent years.  you have to go back a fair bit to even find any where inflation reached more painful levels, which is why many americans have little clue about how money really works anyway, as they haven't felt that much pain.  meanwhile venezuelans or argentinians or zimbabweans have unfortunately been taught by their governments how much it sucks to suck.",1524503391

If you don't like Bitcoin Cash, you can simply refrain from using it instead of spreading false accusations. 

If you feel on-chain scaling solution is a terrible idea, then don't disturb the people that are working on it and making it happen.

"First off, I want to commend you for taking time to learn and research before just jumping in. I am sure this is not the first or last time you will see this phrase, but remember to not invest more than you are willing to lose. This is general investment advice, not something that only applies to crypto. How much risk you're willing to take vs the potential pay off is basically your risk tolerance. For example when I first invested, I started with $100 (pennies to some, considerable amount for others, etc) and later increased that amount. 


You have probably witnessed price swings both up and down in the time you have spent reading and learning. The volatility of the crypto market is partly due to the fact that most people are still not crypto users. You may not have gotten in during 2010, but until the user base grows significantly, prices will continue to be volitale. Early investors and wealthy holders (whales) can easily affect price with large orders. Until more institutional money enters the space, these people are the market makers. Another factor that one must consider is FOMO and FUD, which are literally opposite sentiments. Headlines in articles, rumors, announcements, protocol upgrades, media highlights, government hearings, etc can all cause one or the other.  


Instead of continuing to wait for the ""perfect time"", learn about DCA- Dollar Cost Averaging. This method has allowed people to slowly grow their positions over time without having to ""guess"". In short, you buy small amounts over time instead of a larger amount all at once. The benefit of this is that you may lower your overall buy in price as time moves forward. When the market dips, the ones using DCA will usually buy more. Setting alerts and limit buys on exchanges will help you dollar cost average. 


With all that being said, make sure you also learn about proper storage, security, etc. If your crypto holdings surpass the price of a hardware wallet and you see yourself as a potential long term investor, look into a Trezor or Nano S. These two devices are arguably the safest method for cold (long term) storage. Paper wallets are also a good choice for long term storage, imo. Software or hot wallets are typically the most ""convenient"" to use but their security is pretty much based on the security of the device it's being used on. Never use the same password for different wallets or sites, and make sure you back up seeds and passphrases and store them in a safe place.


Also, set a plan/goals for your future. Are you buying into crypto solely to make money? You may want to learn how crypto gains are taxed where you live and if a short term investor, you may want to learn about swing trades, etc. When trading, remember that we want to gain in Satoshis, not necessarily in fiat. Someone else will be able to explain that more in depth, I am just skimming the subject. 

If you are planning on being a long term holder, you may want to plan your exit strategy. At the present moment liquidity is not the best. This means that people cashing their crypto for fiat cannot just unload giant amounts at once. Even on the larger exchanges, your large sell orders may take several transactions to fill. Then, depending on banking laws in your country, you may be limited to how much you can withdraw in one transaction, etc. I for one plan to hold most of my crypto for long term (3-10 years depending on the coin) and will only sell small percentages of my position as price targets are hit.  What I see most people do for this, is set amounts (percentage of holdings) to sell when your investment reaches new levels (5X, 25X, 100X, etc). I like this method because it encourages you to pull your initial investment while letting the rest continue to multiply. 


Whatever you choose to invest in, and for whatever length of time, I wish you all the best. Sorry that my post was rather long winded, but I wanted to briefly touch on the basics. Remember to never provide your private keys to any site or individual, and to never keep funds on an exchange wallet other than to fill trades,etc.

"&gt;How can someone prevent 2nd layer implementation on BCH?

No one can... but that's not the point. The point is that this is a discussion about the feasibility of on-chain scaling. On-chain *only*. So he, and you in this case, must defend on-chain scaling as **the only** way to scale. If we find that on-chain doesn't work, THEN I'm more than happy to discuss off-chain scaling. But we must first answer the question: Can on-chain scaling work for global adoption and for as long as PCs are around? (Say 100yrs.) If the answer is yes, then you don't need off-chain. If the answer is no, well... you're in a bit of an embarassing situation because for the past I-don't-know-how-long all you've been doing was shitting on off-chain solutions, LN first and foremost. (I don't know what your *personal* opinion is, and that doesn't matter. You are representing the entire sub in this case, and if you are honest, r-btc has been shitting on LN for ever. Prominent court buffoons were even making videos about how shit it is!)

&gt;Then what if the sybil attack is done with a valid UTXO set?

Huh? So what's this attack... thousands of nodes sending you the correct UTXO set?? Not sure I get what you're getting at...

&gt;Say one transactions is missing, your node will accept it, and if the UTXO hash are part of the merkle tree, it take just as much hash power to produce a valid as it is to produce an invalid chain.

My node won't accept anything but the fully valid UTXO set, and valid transactions. Key point is that my node doesn't ""accept"" anything, because it **validates everything**. So I'm only accepting the raw txs (or blocks), the rest is validated.


&gt;2nd layer solutions are bound by physical limit too. (If decentralised, they will scale poorly too)


That's quite an interesting claim... an implicit admission that decentralized systems scale poorly! And that's true regardless of the size of blocks. Actually, you cannot in complete honesty claim that big blocks somehow make the already poor scaling better, can you? If anything, it makes things worse as there's more data being pushed around this distributed network.

Anyway, there's this mathematical theorem on decentralized networks which is called something like ""DSC Theorem"" - Decentralization - Scale - Consensus. The essence of the theorem, ""Cannot have all, pick two"". And then you look at the options:

* Scale + Consensus  (no Decentralization): That's exchanges 

* Decentralization + Consensus (no Scale): That's blockchains

* Decentralization + Scale: That's off-chain, L2 solutions like LN. You sacrifice consensus (as in, not everyone on the network will agree to the exact state, which is obvious if we open a channel as no one except for the two of us knows how much money we've exchanged), but you remain decentralized and have scale. 

And I'm more than happy to embrace this.


&gt;That’s what BCH will do.

&gt;All scaling solutions should be allowed.

Se comment above. But to add one more thing... since most of this is being pushed on Bitcoin, how will it happen on BCH? Will you just copy/paste/adapt the code built by Core &amp; friends? I know it's all open source, but that's also extremely hypocritical. First shit all over Core (and you know this is what r-btc does all. the. time.) and then leech off the code? I'd love to see alternative solutions built with big blocks as driving force for the developments, but all I see is a TON of research done for Bitcoin, and not very much for BCH. And here I'm talking academic research, like Bulletproofs to anonimize transactions. Which I'm absolutely positive BCH would love as well. But without the research by the most hated person on r-btc, yes... Greg Maxwell (and friends), this ain't gonna happen. You need to acknowledge this. As much as he may not be a model citizen, and I have no idea if he is or not, he's doing tremendous work on Bitcoin (and hence every other blockchain out there). And yet, shit is all he's getting on r-btc. Can you see how it all comes across very hypocrytical??

This however is a false argument to store of value and more for a currency side of things. It's a real problem for business if I get $50 today and it is $25 tomorrow and I needed to pay expenses or whatever. Long term savings however,  bitcoin was a mighty contender as a store of value since it not only was able to maintain your value but durasticly increase it. I mean retire next year kind of increases. Any gold bug will tell you their gold is to hedge against inflation and bear markets and bitcoin has done this way better than gold in its short 9 years of life. This still doesn't not mean that BTC is king though simply because of gold's track record  and this is why bitcoin hasn't just swept gold off its feet.

And no, Merkle trees are NOT ENOUGH.

As u/rinexc brought to my attention, the UTXO set database currently used (which was introduced in 2012 and implemented by Core 0.11) is insufficient for this type of pruning of the blockchain. This changed the database from an Unspent Transaction database to database of ""Coins"":

Even Sipa acknowledged that:

&gt;The name ultraprune comes from the fact that instead of a full transaction index, we only (need to) keep an index with unspent outputs. For now, the blocks themselves are kept as usual, although they are only necessary for serving, rescanning and reorganizing.

The issue is what mechanism would be necessary to implement so that a full blockchain download would be optional. It is understood that there will always be sources with the full chain for things like block explorers and chain analysis.

Merkle Trees are enough, if you have the proper data to hash into them.

Everything starts out as a ""fuzzy idea,"" then those ideas get tested, sometimes by debate, then they get tried, and then if they work plans are made to get them implemented.

That's a bit too early to tell right now. If you asked me 6 months ago what ""success"" would look like, I would have said being worth more than BTC or having more accumulated proof of work than BTC. For now I suppose I'll be happy with the latest price rise and the continuing adoption, but I'm honestly quite disappointed that BTC is still worth so much more and still so much more mainstream.

That's no from conclusion that's from the paragraph under conclusion where it speaks of the next paper, and it says:

&gt;The behavior of the system at &gt;51% hash power and at
varying difficulties (both as a static system and under increasing investment) will also be presented.

This means that in the next paper he will discuss if a mining pool with more than 51% of hashpower makes money by being selfish or not at different difficulties. This, if anything, implies that the current analysis is for pools with less than 51% and at different difficulties.

Anyway, this is what the actual conclusion says:

&gt;Bitcoin mining with a constant hash rate is a zero-sum game. Without increasing the hash rate, miners cannot earn more than the default honest strategy. Without increasing the hash rate, miners cannot earn more than the default honest strategy. At best, they can cause all parties to lose revenue. Revenue is not profit; however, even in this instance, we demonstrated that the overall rates of revenue are lowered and therefore no rational, profit-seeking miner would engage in such a strategy.

No the gold standard are papers like the one Craig wrote.

"All crypto has a ""key"".  That key is a private secret for the owner of the crypto, and it is used to digitally sign things.  When you send crypto to somebody else, you send it by signing with your key the statement ""I am sending this money I have to somebody else"", and that statement and digital signature are stored on the coin's blockchain.  That's how everybody knows who has what money.  The digital signature is not the private key, but it mathematically proves that you must have had the private key in order to make the signature.  So with the blockchain having all those signatures, you can trace back the history of a coin and prove through signatures that it does belong to you now.

So when you have a ""wallet"" on your desktop, it's just software that keeps that key -- which is just a really big number -- stored in it and it signs those signatures for you when you want to send money and it watches new blocks to see if somebody else has sent money to you.  That's all wallet software does.  When you store money on an exchange, it's not really your money, the exchange keeps those keys and does all the signing and just tells you that you have X amount of crypto with them.  But if they disappear or steal it, it's gone, because they had those private keys.  So you want to keep your own private keys, because then you really actually have the money, not somebody else like an exchange.

The risk in having it yourself is if your computer crashes, the number may get erased off your hard drive, or if you get hacked, the hacker can see the number and use it to send himself your money.  So what the ledger does is it keeps that number -- the private key -- inside itself, and then you plug it into your computer and it will give your computer a digital signature.  The private key number never leaves the device.  Only digital signatures leave the device.  So even if you get hacked, your money isn't at risk, because the private keys simply cannot be accessed by your computer or anything else.

Lydia does not prove your point that a vibrant free market can form in the absence of government.  It was part of an empire that went about coining their own currency.  That means there was a centralized government behind it.  The Greeks were also an empire who coined currency and had rules and laws to govern commerce.

I never said Bitcoin was funded by the government idiot, i said the technology that allows it work was funded by the government.

You're the mindless idiot talking about parallel realities instead of dealing in the reality we're in.

I dont have an argument?  You can challenge my assertion all you want but you cannot prove your assertion.  In this reality, bitcoin would not be possible without government funded technology enabling it.  It wouldnt be able to work on a network, communicate through IP or hash without government funded technology.  You're the idiot that keeps talking about hypothetical realities and the possibility of bitcoin potentially existing in the absence of a government.  These are pure fantasies you cant prove, the reality is that bitcoin exists today largely because of the culmination of scientific accomplishments and development that were derived from taxpayer funding.  I dont need an argument:  THESE ARE FACTS.  They simply are reality.  It is you that cannot prove your point because youre dealing with hypothetical situations.  We arent talking about different universes or potentialities, we're talking about this one right here in front of you.

You still cant tell me how a vibrant free market exists without a government upholding and securing your rights.  That's the entire premise of your argument is that there doesnt need to be a government for technology like bitcoin to emerge, so tell me, what secures intellectual and property rights in the absence of government?  

I simply stated the facts:  Bitcoin as we know it would not exist without government funding creating the underlying technologies that allow Bitcoin to function.  It wouldnt be able to part of a network, to communicate on that network or to perform the cryptographic hashing functions.  This is simply reality based on the facts.  You want to talk about fictional worlds or alternate universes where bitcoin could hypothetically exist without the government creating all the underlying technology.  It is you living in a delusional fantasy world that cant defend his points.   You're the zealot that calls himself a libertarian and seems to think the free market can provide all the things governments does but cant point to a single example of it ever happening.",1524498735

"Agreed;  Core chose to create a dangerous address type where users can loose money at worst and payments maybe succeed at best and I never expect them to change that (they appear to love creating user confusion/horrible end user experiences)

Our community appears much more open to actual system upgrades that eliminate user confusion rather than add confusion, so we are in a perfect position to point out the flaws/help new users by greatly warning if someone tries to use a SW address in a Bitcoin Cash client and maybe gently warning them when they use a legacy address format

&gt; ""There was no trading data cited. I never even saw an interview of anybody saying that I sold my gold to buy bitcoin,"" he said.

&gt; Bitcoin isn't seen as a store of value by many, Morgan says. When he was a panelist at a resource investment conference last year, the moderator asked panelists where they would invest money they needed in 10 years. All of them, including Morgan, opted for gold over bitcoin.

"This article brings up two common points that should be corrected:

1) The Bitcoin network's blocksize *was* increased. That was one of the side-features of Segregated Witness.

2) Banks, themselves, are not the true problem that Bitcoin was trying to solve. Bitcoin is all about freedom. Lightning Network upholds that value, even if ""Banks"" start to form, because no intermediary has the ability to censor or otherwise prevent you from transacting with any other party.

The part about fees no longer all going towards the miners is a decent enough point. However, you have to understand that prior to Lightning, the fee mechanism was deeply flawed from a consumer standpoint: the amount of your fee had absolutely no relationship with the amount of value that you were transacting over the network. Lightning fixes that. Because of that, the potential for global adoption is much greater than it otherwise would be. Presumably, that increased adoption will lead to larger fees for miners. But, like I said, what was said about fees being redirected away from miners was a good point. There is no solid proof that what I just postulated will come to pass. Please continue to push this argument until there is solid evidence against it.",1524498588

"&gt; But of course, if someone just uses a browser and nothing else.. hell.. chrome OS might be enough.

Being honest though, that describes most people.

I completely get what you're saying, and agree to an extent. At the same time, when it comes to software (like Office) the large companies are pushing for SaaS.  So sure... MS Office isn't on other OSes natively... until you boot up your browser.  Or, if people that know what they're doing are around, you can put PlayOnLinux or a VM on the machine for that.

&gt; If I install her some linux, which one would i go for? mint? ubuntu? kubuntu? xubuntu? suse? fedora?

What you're missing is the underlying workings.  They all use the linux kernel - and most of the ones you listed are variants of a single distribution which means the biggest decision you're going to need to make is what software you want by default.

Ignoring we're doing ""Windows as a service"" now, Windows 7 had starter, home basic, home premium, professional, enterprise, ultimate.  You've also got Starter N, Home Premium N, Professional N, Enterprise N, and Ultimate N. And K versions of the above. And KN versions of the above. That comes to a grand total of 24 versions between standard, N, K, and KN, all configured slightly differently.  ( N, K, and KN exist because MS was found guilty of violating anti-trust laws btw).

The answer to your question though is whichever version fits her needs the best. That's the beauty of an open OS environment vs closed.  If you want a minimalistic install, go for it.  Want one on Windows?  Good luck.

&gt; Will it be 100% compatible with the word files she gets from her other teachers?

Yes, in most instances. Every now and then there's a formatting bug or something similar in opening a document - but it's usually not noticable.

&gt; Will she need to tell them that they get an ODT file back, instead of an docx?

No. It opens and saves in .docx.

&gt; If my mum always used ubuntu she couldn't navigate on someones pc with suse on top of it.

That's already the case.  People familiar with a single OS are usually only familiar with that OS.  The older crowd for example don't want to migrate from XP because that's what they're used to.  They tried Vista and didn't get it.  Didn't get 7.  Didn't get 8 or 8.1.  And they don't understand how to use 10 either.  They don't touch macOS.  They *only* use computers with Windows XP.

And that comes down almost 100% to only understand one particular graphical desktop.  Know what I did to give those kinds of people a hand?  I tweaked the desktop environment on the linux distro to look identical to Windows XP.  All of a sudden those people can use two different OSes with no issues.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to push linux or anything.  I've just used a ton of different OSes (both CLI and desktop environment based).  The best analogy is like cars.  There are a ridiculous amount of models out there.  Which do you buy?  First question is always ""well what is it you need?""  Do you need speed? Reliability?  Security?  Stability?  Familiarity?

The above really applies to all technology honesty.  Studies have shown that the first pieces of a particular type of technology a person uses is often the only one they will ever use.  You see it in cell phones (people only using flips, android, iOS), computers and tablets.  Its the main reason behind companies like Apple pushing to have Apple devices in schools.  It costs them money - but it secures brand loyalty from a **LOT** of people.

And we're going to see the exact same thing in Crypto spaces.  People are going to gravitate to what they learn first.  If they're introduced to one project and get used to it - they're probably not going to jump to another that might better suit their needs, whether that's an exchange, the actual crypto, or whatever.  

The only time that changes is when more tech savvy people take the time to break things down and make something new familiar to them (making Mint look like Windows XP for example).",1524498487

GRS - Going long term here and personally the most promising.

It's 100 Million market cap cryptocurrency payment coin founded March 2014 that's based on Bitcoin, 100M Market cap, 105M max Supply, 69 Circulating. It uses Grostl-512 algorithm and has an alternative derivate to be forked if ASIC is ever made. It has wallets for every system including iOS. Transactions are instantaneous and cost less than 100th of a cent. It has privacy available to hide transactions and wallet funds. Trezor HW wallet is mostly ready and Ledger integration is at 20%. There is a policy that announcements will never be pre-announced. The dev release is done quarterly. Next one is Jun 22. The development has been so far, absolutely drama-less. I hope it replaces Litecoin as it is a product ready to use and to become mass-adopted.

DBC - Mid term here

DeepBrain Chain is a PoS currency that it's intended to lower prices of Neuronal simulations for A.I. applications. This means universities and organisations can do AI simulations cheaper than Google or nVidia Tesla. The product is not ready but the company seems solid. If this proves profitable, it could take a lot of mining power into DBC folding.

DOVU - Long Term

Dovu is an ERC20 token intended for users to share mobility data and receive DOVU tokens. Product is on pilot phase by BMW itself even though the token is a mere 6 Million market cap. It is aimed for non-crypto people to have granted DOVU tokens when they share mobility data to companies and organisations. They will be able to trade DOVU for other crypto or fiat, or also services.

Mysterium is 11 Million market cap token for decentralised VPN. I landed on this without even knowing what it was, because I bought a little it after its price crashed after being delisted on Bittrex. There is no product yet but they are going to release the Alpha in the next months. After researching onto it I came to the conclusion which indeed it could grow up a lot if adoption comes, since VPN is so important nowadays.

Bitcoin Mushroom Tip,1524497296
"I don't like the highway analogy, in my experiences highways are just as congested with more lanes, because at some point you need to get off using an off ramp, which bottlenecks and pushes traffic back up the highway. I've seen this happen on two big highways between Pretoria and Johannesburg. Traffic on our 6 lanes today is no better than it was on the two lanes before. 

I feel like that analogy more suits LN on BTC, in peak time traffic when everyone closes their channels (they take the off ramp) and everyone is stuck in that traffic. 

I can't think of a good analogy for 32mb blocks...

LN on Bitcoin Cash would be cool though, multiple lanes on the highway, and just as many lanes on the off ramp. I honestly don't understand why the core chain block size wasn't increased alongside the LN implementation. It feels like such a wasted opportunity! Slippery slope is not a good argument, neither is 'it would hold back adoption', LN enables nano payments, surely that's a good enough reason to adopt it without strangling the main chain ffs.

Large block don't lead to mining centralisation.

I actually expect BTC mining to centralise.

As high network transaction fee disproportionally hurt the small miner

This one was called Decrypting Crypto: The evolutionary biology behind blockchain-backed currencies, and theorized that the toxoplamosis bacteria thingie (a real thing) helps cats out by encouraging humans who are infected (through cat poop) to buy things that cats like:

boxes

warm things

things they can sit on

"This data is technically impossible to produce, due to the fact that people don't need to ask for permission or signal their intent.

To get you a good overview however, you can look at some examples, and I will only give one here but encourage you to look up more and share your findings:

Bitpay has over the course of their existence, grown in a trend that resembles/follows the exponential growth of the bitcoin valuation; going from their first 1 merchant, to a repository which I think two years ago was listed as being more than 100,000 accounts.

Since then, valuation has moved around, some merchants have dropped out, alot of accounts are likely stale etc, but for this example I don't need a fixed actual number, so I will claim that they have N merchants today.

Now, for bitcoin cash, in this particular context, by virtue of being largely 1:1 compatible, have ended up being supported by bitpay natively, for all merchants. That means that what took bitcoin several years to build up, bitcoin cash adopted in a matter of half a year.

For all large payment processors that used to accept bitcoin and today accept bitcoin cash, this pattern holds true.

For individual merchants and hobbyists however, the numbers are much more difficult to allude to; so to get to the bottom of that you would need to do statistical research and actually poll for support.

My anecdotal evidence based on my own spending habits indicate that even on this comparison, bitcoin cash is growing favourable to bitcoin, in the sense that bitcoin during the last half year, **for my spending habits**, have actually had a negative adoption rate; while bitcoin cash has kept up just fine.",1524496185

There was a time when this wasn't the case. It used to be that every nation's currency was just a name for a weight in gold. Hell, the term ""dollar"" came from ""thaler,"" which was a privately minted silver coin that was very reputable and used throughout Europe for centuries. Nations since monopolized mints, dissociated currencies from gold/weight in gold, and tricked us into letting them rape the value of it through inflation and destructive monetary policy that led to the fiat we have today.

Crypto fits the true definition of ""money"" more than fiat ever will. At least, it has the potential to. Assuming it is adopted, it would be the perfect medium of exchange.",1524494221

For example, the market may feel that a certain alt coin/token is now overpriced and will correct its satoshi value to a point by which its dollar value seems more reasonable.

"That thread is from 2011 when gold was dropping because it was overbought and due for a correction in terms of dollars. Of course it should have gone down against dollars. No asset moves in a straight line.

Personally, I was buying gold in late 2015 when the price was down dramatically in terms of dollars and due to come back up. (It has, by more than 30%, and that will likely continue on for some time until it does the opposite once again.)

But even this idea of ""up"" and ""down"" is silly because it assumes that the dollar is a suitable monetary basis. It's not. 

Gold continues to remain stable against all other commodities and real assets, which fluctuate in price around it. This is true regardless of whether it goes ""up"" or ""down"" in terms of dollars. 

Even as gold went ""down"" years ago in dollar terms for instance, it went *up* in commodity terms. That trend has continued for years since, and I'd say that right now, most commodities are very cheap in terms of gold, and so I have been buying much more platinum, silver, oil, timber, copper, steel and other commodities, and saving far less in the form of gold. (I also buy a good deal of attractively priced foreign stocks, local real estate and BCH.)

Gold is still inexpensive however, relative to dollars and US stocks, and will likely rise against them, even as other commodities rise against it going forward from here.

Incidentally, you don't even need to *own* any gold to benefit from using it as a better yardstick than the dollar or Bitcoin currently is. You could speculate entirely in Bitcoin and still benefit from using gold in this way. 

I wouldn't even argue that gold is an especially good buy from current levels, compared to other options. But it still remains the most stable of all real assets, and therefore, the best unit of account for long-term planning.

As mentioned, gold keeps on trading in a fairly narrow range against other commodities and against paper assets. It does this whether or not you believe it makes for good money. Your opinion of whether it *should* function this way is irrelevant, and you can't reasonably refute that this is an empirically observable feature of reality. 

The economic realities of production costs vs demand just don't really care about your ideology, mine, or anyone else's. Gold just keeps on trading in a fairly predictable range against other commodities, regardless of what we say or believe. And that is why it is still the best form of money as of yet discovered. 

Will Bitcoin do this better some day? Maybe. Currently, it does not. 

I will happily concede that BCH is better as *currency*, and I own lots of it. But I can't pretend it is currently good *money* or an effective unit of account or value measurement. It's not. I also can't pretend it is currently a more predictable store of value. It isn't.

Anyway, these are empirical questions and have empirical answers. No amount of wishful thinking and plausible-sounding speculation can change current economic reality. And the current economic reality is that gold still functions as a more stable basis for economic calculation and comparison than dollars or Bitcoin or anything else we have yet discovered.

I am open to the idea that this may change some day. But I can't pretend it has already happened when it has not.

In any event, that thread does not and cannot counter anything I have just typed here. These are empirically true statements about reality and you can easily confirm them for yourself if you'd like to do so.",1524493775

"I'm Game
1. In early 2010 I was on an economics focused message board and a person claiming to be Satoshi(could have been, who knows) linked to a technical paper for a revolutionary new currency. I read the white-paper and thought that it would indeed be revolutionary. Started mining on one of the first pools, although I lost those initial coins in a hard-drive wipe. Been in ever since, full time since 2012.
2. Ethereum, right from the run-up to the token-sale you could tell that this new platform was going to change the game entirely. If you can follow what Vitalik Buterin says about the tech it's hard not to get excited. Smart-Contracts and ERC Tokens have changed the game forever. Ethereum is still in it's infancy and growing but has already shown a resilience and adaptability to the various hacks, exploits, and network congestion issues that it has faced. It has a really great team and a great community behind it. 
3. The steep declines of the first quarter should have been wholly expected, and in-fact were expected by the mainstream. the bubble that inflated so steeply in the last quarter of 2017 was bound to pop, nobody knew exactly when. A confluence of similarly expected events like year-end profit taking, triggered the market to assume that the bubble was popping(a rush to the exit). This was further exacerbated by the fact that the bubble was partly inflated by new and inexperienced investors. Being in crypto from the beginning however has allowed me to formulate an opinion of crypto that is independent of current market fluctuations. Bitcoin has crashed and mooned several times in it's history, it probably will again.
4. I have sparingly used crypto for purchases in the past(not million-dollar pizzas), and have intention to in the future. I prefer crypto to gold for the fact that it is a store of value that can actually be used in real transactions. I like that there are specific crypto options that are focused on being transaction currencies. 
5. I Hodled BTC all the way to Jan 2018, finally sold on the way down from the top and recently bought back in on the way back up from the bottom.

When I wanted to use Bitcoin Cash (a hard fork) I needed new wallet software, and if I wanted to run a node I would need new node software. My Bitcoin node is not compatible with the BCH network but is compatible with the BTC network. If they are both equal forks that require users to upgrade why am I still on the BTC network?

Bitcoin is extremely volatile in its value, while gold holds it's value.

For example let's say one ounce of gold will keep me afloat for one month (rent, utilities, food, etc.). This should remain as true today as it was decades ago and for decades to come. One ounce is tradable for the same goods and services regardless of what happens to our fiat currency.

Bitcoin on the other hand is a gamble. I have no idea whether I'll be able to buy a Maserati, a private jet, or a week's worth of groceries with my BTC even a year from now. The fact that you can buy many times as much as what you could have with the same bitcoin from even a year ago shows that.

Jump way too early and you are a wuss. Jump too late and you get hit by the truck. Jump just in time and you are a hero.

The real market value wasn't $250k, $300k, it was really higher. Who knows what it really is, the fact that we keep going up without new money really coming in (just a guess of course, but public sentiment is still really poor I think). 

When the next wave of new money comes in, or the next wave of phased adoption hits (or builds over time), then we will see the real magic happen.

That's why buying today is still so so early and bigtime at the ground floor. Sure, maybe you should have jumped in 2 weeks ago (and good job those that did), but no buy today is going to look bad in a year.

We may pull back and it may look bad in a month (IMO we don't pull back any more than 10% at a time, but I'm pulling that out of my ass of course). 

If it pulls back I buy in heavier. If it keeps rising I buy in, at increasingly smaller amounts. If we go parabolic I start selling, first in smaller amounts then increasing amounts.

If we grow slowly, I don't sell ever. If we go unhealthy parabolic again, I will start slowly pulls my some off the table. 

Should be an interesting year for sure. 

In 5-10 years I don't think it's crazy to think we are at 50-200T or higher. It depends on how much adoption we get, where people's ""grocery money"" is money entering, because vendors give crypto discounts (to save visa fees). 

Once we get that kind of ""money entering"", we will take off to hundreds of trillions in crypto marketcap.

I mean, the true ceiling here is the total global economy. Really. Will it happen? Probably not. But maybe. 

0.4 trillion though? That's fucking peanuts.

As soon as someone goes to buy a pizza, and they have the option of saving a dollar by clicking a button on their phone, loading their wallet and scanning it to the pizzeria in 5 seconds, and the pizzeria saves a buck from visa fees and gets their money today and not next week.

Because many BTC users pay from an exchange or a shitty wallet, they end up paying FAR higher fees than they need to. That's not BTC's fault, that's the fault of clueless users who don't educate themselves and end up being suckers. 

And guess what? That overall range figure affects this average to a degree that's laughable. Nobody goes by that figure or even gives it the time of day, except of course, delusional idiots like you. :D

All anyone who doesn't have his/her head up his/her ass has to do is look at the chart and see that transactions where people are paying their lowest tier range are getting processed within 3 blocks.

An Updated Summary of Lamden

Lamden's ultimate goal is to facilitate the creation and use of blockchain technology for enterprises. 
 
To achieve this, Lamden offers an open source developer's tool kit that allows businesses to launch their own fully-customizable private or public,  blockchain in minutes. 
 
The 4 main components of Lamden’s developer suite are Saffron, Flora, Clove and Cilantro. 
 
SAFFRON
Allows the creation of fully customizable blockchains in minutes. Similar to what ‘Squarespace’ does for web building, Saffron does for blockchain creation. 
 
FLORA
The smart contract package manager is a one-stop-shop for smart contracts, app creation and tuning.  
 
CLOVE
Lamden's atomic swap engine allows the instantaneous and trustless trading of crypto assets and currencies (currently supporting 1,000 different tokens like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ether, ERC20, and soon Neo). 
 
Clove also allows blockchains to exchange assets or data packages with other blockchains, even if they are based on different protocols. This will allow your shiny new blockchain to communicate with any other blockchain (think about the supply chain integration possibilities this offers). 
 
Also, using Clove Lamden has developed different implementations to take advantage of this technology: 
 
1. ClovePay 
A Clove API that allows merchants to accept payments in any currency and receive it in any other of his choosing. 
 
Furthermore Lamden is creating tokenized fiat pairings so that merchants can also receive payments in any fiat currency and instantly convert it to the cryptocurrency of their choice. Conversely, they can accept payments in any crypto and receive it in fiat. We like to call it the PayPal killer! 
 
2. LamdeX 
Also based on Clove comes our very own crypto/fiat exchange. By using atomic swaps, users can exchange between any of the 1,000 tokens supported on the network and/or our tokenized fiat pairings (i.e. crypto-crypto / crypto-fiat / fiat-crypto / fiat-fiat). 
 
3. LamdeX Pro 
A currency exchange engine that allows existing exchanges to increase the tokens offered to their clients to any and/or all of the 1,000 tokens already exchangeable. Additionally, it allows for exchanges to create trustless shared market pools to exponentially increase liquidity and thus create a better service and overall experience for their customers. (Note: I suggest an option for PRO users, to stake, say 1 million TAU, and get free Oracle verification) 
 
4. LamdeX Wallet   
Store, send and receive any crypto and store it as any other crypto. Fast, safe and easy to use. Metamask meets atomic swaps! 
 
CILANTRO
Lamden’s mission is set to increase the adoption of blockchain so that innovation can flourish. 
 
To do so effectively, a blockchain with highly attractive features must exist, however, currently existing options like Ethereum or Bitcoin are very limited (i.e. they are very good for one thing and not so much for another). Thus they would carry their own limitations onto new blockchains based on them. 
 
Therefore, a project with a non-limiting blockchain, free, lighting-fast transactions, future-proof governance, ever-evolving infrastructure and atomic swaps naturally embedded in its core was necessary. 
 
So, the final piece of the puzzle was to create such a blockchain. We called it Cilantro and it will be deployed on Q4 2018. 
 
Blockchains based on Cilantro will easily allow 10,000 tx/sec and will be fully customizable to meet the very different needs of companies. 
 
Moreover, Cilantro hosts our Token, TAU, with which holders will be able to stake for profit and/or help its infrastructure by setting up a 100k TAU masternode (Obelisks) or 10k TAU Witnesses. Witnesses can also be voted into Delegates, to further assist the network functionality.

The worth of the coin or tokens is going to be worth back at what it was before and most likely new All\-time highs. Also, I won't recommend to ""hedge"" with Bitcoin nowadays, as it's losing dominance and some altcoins had recovered fully and have got new ATHs.

You also openly admit you're not a coder, which means you don't really understand the technicalities of the problem at hand. (Nothing wrong with that, not everyone is a coder, and that's great. But you need to leave the technical conversations to those who ARE experts. I don't know your expertise, but if I started to talk about it you'd dismiss me immediately, unless we happen to have the same expertise. So why do you think you are in a position to talk about technical issues better than people who ARE technical???)

An unfortunate real life fact of blockchains like Bitcoin and BCH is that **you must bootstrap the full blockchain to determine the validity of the UTXO set**. (ETH is different, not talking about ETH here.) And FOR NOW, no one on Earth, quite literally, knows how to establish the validity of the UTXO set *without* a full bootstrap. And no, Merkle trees are *NOT ENOUGH*.

You can insist on claiming Merkle trees are enogh, there are people who insist that the Earth is flat, or you can spend more time understanding the technical issues behind this whole story.

This reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of the Bitcoin design, miners, even big miners were always part of the original design, they're not controlling anything, nor are they ""intermediaries"" - they secure the blockchain as they were designed to do from the very beginning.

It was always anticipated by Satoshi that miners would become big mining farms, this has happened exactly as it was predicted, there is nothing wrong with it.

The myth of the ""evil miners"" was propagated by those clueless (or simply malicious) Core devs that you're so fond of.

"Hi Pieter
&gt; I don't care much about (public) sidechains as more than a research project. They make trade-offs that I think are very hard to accept for production use (the miners can steal sidechain funds).

I've been thinking that this is indeed clearly a trade-off of public sidechains like drivechains compared to a theoretical, more secure implementation. However it may be wrong to think that it is a trade-off compared to *today's* situation.

The possibility of stealing funds from an alternative block chain does exist today, given all the funds that are stored in insecure altcoins. The funds that could be stolen by attacking sidechain miners, today are not at all stored in bitcoin.

Taking this into consideration, it seems to me that there is no trade-off associated with the introduction of sidechains. The value that would be taken away from bitcoin in a potential sidechain theft is the new value that sidechains would introduce. I.e. assuming that all funds from all sidechains would be stolen, this is net neutral for Bitcoin.

In addition, in fact a Bitcoin+sidechains seems to even be slightly better than today's situation in this respect: There is a valid concern that funds stolen from an alternative block chain could be used to attack Bitcoin. There is no defense against an altcoin theft it in the Bitcoin network. In sidechains on the other hand, *there are* defense mechanisms that Bitcoin nodes could employ against the theft (soft fork).

When I think of it this way, it seems that the net effect of enabling public sidechains would be very positive, since the drawbacks are not introduced by them but already exist, but on the other hand there are many, very important benefits introduced to Bitcoin, and by extension to the world.

What do you think?",1524490321

I know 90% of it is my fault and Jaxx’s. But I do think a little foresight would have been good. Bitcoin/crypto is already pretty bleeding edge, but BCH took it a step further. It’s tough to adopt when such incompatibilities exist.

At least there’s a hard fork coming whichll serve to insure everyone’s clients once again meet a minimum threshold.

&gt; as opposed to BTC which is in process of moving away from on-chain transactions and moving to off-chain (LN)

Contrary to what you think LN is much closer to Satoshi's P2P vision, than the mining pool controlled block chain today: if two LN peers know each other, they can securely transmit funds without any intermediate.

&gt; Don't get me wrong, all the optimizations implemented over the years are important, however the main invention is the P2P electronic cash system.

Yes, a P2P ledger backed by POW is a great fundamental idea, and it's Satoshi who made it possible. Still, without help he would have nothing. And BCH is based on this help as well as BTC. Calling names on BTC developers is like making a dump in the middle of your living room.

A more likely outcome I suspect is when fees become too expensive post LN adoption, an increase in BTC block size. 

For me, I fall on the size of preferring the smaller limit initially to encourage transaction size efficiency and solutions with unlimited tx per second (custodian and second layer, giving consumers the choice), but can see both arguments.

Another thing to consider is that the transactions done with a proper privacy coin can't be tracked.

So it is in the interest of state agencies to keep the fiat gateways online, and not force privacy coin users to decentralized exchanges.

Then Bitcoin will be like how it was suppose to be. With 32 MB we are good for maybe the next 10 - 20 years. The real work is going to be to evangelize Bitcoin as a solution and get some real adoption going until a real Bitcoin economy is there where people can live their lives without ever needing fiat money.

If you want an actual good coin that is going to be an underlying component of a cryptocurrency ecosystem in 10 years (and isn't some shit like Dentacoin that's going to evaporate as you hold it), take a look at TKY, TheKey. 

It will be the base layer of Identification on the Neo ecosystem, and they are actively working with the Chinese Gov't (the roadblock to implementing crypto in China). The whole Chinese market is depressed (for good reason), but if/when China figures this out (and they WILL, China isn't the kind of country to be left behind), then the entire Neo ecosystem has a real good chance of exploding. Even if the Chinese Gov't issues their own crypto, it's looking more and more likely to be based on the Neo ecosystem, and will use stuff like ID Verification services of TKY.

This is a 2 cent coin right now, and an actual legit project.

People always say ""when you are drinking, don't piss, once you do you break the seal and will have to piss nonstop, ever 30 mins"". Really all that is happening is that you need to piss, you don't piss, more piss builds up, you release it, but it's building up and fills your bladder again faster, so you have to piss again.

If you just piss the first time you needed to, you'd piss at very normal intervals. If you ""don't break the seal"", you create the very phenomena you were afraid of doing.

It's the same thing with pushing against resistance levels. Natural market demand probably wants BTC at $9500 right now, but we keep bouncing off $9000. The market demand isn't slowing down, it's just being ""caged in"" for the time being. By the time we break through, the natural market demand may be $9800 by then, but we were suppressing it ""artificially"" by this stupid emotional based resistance level, created because we have 10 fingers and a DEX-10 counting system, and assign greater ""significance"" to any number as a multiple of 10.

Once we break $9000 and skyrocket to $9500 or whatever we hit, he created the phenomena, just based on pent-up market demand only now being ""released"".

We break the seal on BTC and the stream shoots to the fucking ceiling, and keeps going until we ""empty"" the ""bladder"" (bottled-up demand). 

Then we hit the $10k resistance level and rince/repeat.

TLDR: BTC resistance levels is the exact same thing as ""breaking the seal"" in drinking.",1524482848

"**Gulf of Tonkin incident**

The Gulf of Tonkin incident (Vietnamese: Sự kiện Vịnh Bắc Bộ), also known as the USS Maddox incident, was an international confrontation that led to the United States engaging more directly in the Vietnam War. It involved either one or two separate confrontations involving North Vietnam and the United States in the waters of the Gulf of Tonkin. The original American report blamed North Vietnam for both incidents, but eventually became very controversial with widespread claims that either one or both incidents were false, and possibly deliberately so. On August 2, 1964, the destroyer USS Maddox, while performing a signals intelligence patrol as part of DESOTO operations, was pursued by three North Vietnamese Navy torpedo boats of the 135th Torpedo Squadron.

"I could advance a technical / strategic argument for why BCH is better, but you'll likely hear this from others.

In the end, the factor that pushed me over into the BCH camp is the community.  The BTC online communities lean heavily on censorship and hamfisted moderation of anyone who persistently questions the party line, and a single, unknown person has had tremendous influence in removing these ""undesirables"" from the community.

Now, even if all the conspiracy theories are false, groupthink is still a thing.  If you see a community divided into ""groupthinkers"" who live mainly inside an information bubble that protects them from ""bad ideas"" and a more hetergeneous group of rivals that live mainly in uncensored space, betting against the groupthinkers is the rational bet.  Even if by chance they happen to have all the advantages, eventually such a society is doomed to failure.  The field of Organizational Development is rife with case study after case study about the toxicity of groupthink.

"&gt; They technically ""became miners"" 

then they are miners. 

You cannot start to create hierarchies for motive, or deployment process. one that is in control of mining processes is a miner, regardless of where that expending of energy is happening. 

&gt;  implied some sort of link between the authors of the software that attempted to steal electricity from millions of people anonymously over the internet and the group of people who secretly built an ASIC.

no i didn't. 

you said that 'miners' as a whole always work in the interest of the chain, as their livelihood depends on it. I questioned it, and gave you three examples where miners were not working in the interests of the chain. that is all that i was doing. 

&gt; Nor do they share the same ambitions or goals, and in fact that actions of one are antithetical to the other.

which is exactly what i am getting at. 

you cannot presume motive for miners - at any stage - which is why we have to step through game theory motives, incentives, and attack vectors to try and get a grip on all eventualities. 

&gt; Unlike long-investment bound asic miners, or even large scale GPU miners, botnet operators have zero ties to the success or failure of the coin. They simply want to get their money by stealing electricity from ten thousand people, that's all.

i agree with you here. but as they are 'technically miners', then their motives are just as valid - especially in devising game theoretic/ attack vector scenarios. 

&gt; Of course, the development itself wouldn't need to be secret if the community weren't very anti-asic, so that itself is in part a consequence of their choices

This may be a valid point (one of your first), but you are assuming that the miners and manufacturers of ASICS prefer free markets, than oligarchical markets. I am not sure if this is a correct assumption to make. 

Indeed, i am guessing the evidence that we have points to the contrary (i.e that ASIC distribution and manufacture is heavily skewed in favour of currently capital invested miners). 

&gt; What percentage of miners are colluding in this way?

Well lets look at [BCH hash rate distribution.](https://blockchain.info/pools). Lets assume that the top six form a collusion, and that the distribution remains the same for the foreseeable future. That gives them over 50% of hash rate. 

How large is the average produced blocksize? 

Lets say average block size is 4GB (we are talking about the future here)

&gt; What's the maximum blocksize of the network?
8GB

&gt;Is this an asic-resistant network or an asic-mined network?

ASIC mined

&gt; What are the colluding miners doing to the non-colluding miners, are they orphaning non-participants?

As they hold over 51%, yes they are orphaning non colluding miner blocks. They artifically limit the blocksize to 3GB (citing propogation issues, and the great wall of China). They cause a fee market to occur.

&gt;  How high is this minimum they are attempting to set the fees at, and did they do any PR/discussions about it to promote the concept to the community?

I don't know, pick a number. It all depends on exchange rate and what is able to be born by the market at the current time. 100 sat/Byte for arguments sake. They mentioned the proposal (citing decrease in block reward and worsening profitability). it was rejected, they went ahead with their plans anyway. 

&gt;  When we know them we can begin to work out the scenarios.

You are clever enough to know that you could have worked out the scenario yourself, and you clever enough to know what the fair assumptions would have been.

&gt; And the developers/community are hardly defenseless here. They can soft-fork to change the rules against the specific strategy the miners have taken, or they can change PoW, or they can do any number of other things against the cartel's particular strategy. This reaction is what makes the strategy high risk.

You aren't thinking this through. 

As i stated right at the start, there is a cost to changing chains that outweighs the increase in fees. 

Also, as the collusion owns 51% hashpower, the community cannot just fork. A POW change may be effective....and would be a last case scenario. 

Is that the defence strategy then? 

&gt; Power in the Bitcoin world is a confluence of political, developer, business, exchange, merchant, user, and miner choices. No single entity has control, by design, and if any single entity bucks the rest and tries to seize control, it is going to go very very badly for them. 

This is proven not to be the case. 

Indeed, the whole reason that BCH exists is because (supposedly) one group wrestled control. 

Did it end badly for them? Not really. 

They still have their chain, it is still seen at BTC, and all the people that were against their strategy have moved away to another chain. Sounds pretty much perfect to me. 

&gt; businesses/exchanges/merchants/users are almost certainly going to disagree and attempt to convince developers to change the rules in a way that flips the table on the colluding miners

perhaps true, though empirical evidence suggests that a host of businesses in the sphere love high fees. because, guess what? 

it means they can charge even higher fees! see any number of exchange withdrawal fees. 

&gt; Without the ecosystem they're holding useless numbers with a very big electricity bill to show for it.

again, i stated my main assumption, that the cost of moving chains outweighs the increase in transaction costs.  

&gt; Taking steps that harm adoption and merchant usability would possibly bite them in the ass before the 2 year cycle is up.

This assumption is based on now, not on our hypothesised future. 

The dev cycle for ASICS may have changed drastically by then (as it has over the last few years). ",1524478220

Verify is a reputation protocol that facilitates trust-based transactions over the blockchain. Our main focus is on commerce, and how to make it easier for people to buy/sell things using crypto.

- Who is Verify’s target market? 
The global retail market is an ideal customer for Verify with 22trillion dollars in global trade the market is huge and currently undergoing massive expansion.

Yazin Alirhayim is the CEO you can read his background in e-payment and secure payment services; his last company, White, was acquired by Payfort (an Amazon company). Check out his Linkedin here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/yazin/
Verify has several industry experts in reputation, economics and payments on the advisory board.

- What is the max supply? 
There will only ever be 50,000,000 CRED tokens, with the majority of tokens currently locked up.

For me: 
CRED has a super low cap and supply. They're working on a proper product that has utility and aren't focused on exchanges and mooning etc. They're focused on building a good product (hence why the price took an even bigger drop than most - i.e. there's little liquidity due to it not being on any big exchanges and people have got fed up). 

However, in the last couple of months they've launched a slick new site, an alpha and they've annouced one of the biggest banks in the UAE is testing it. A few days ago they announced (in their telegram group) 2-3 more banks are going to start testing now too so they'll cover 80% of the market. They also just took on 8 interns and a few developers and I think more are to follow.

Once they get listed on a decent exchange (not sure if you saw what happened with Kucoin - you might see details on their site, disgrace) I really think it's going to take off big time.

Anyways, enough shilling from me, ha. 

Go do a little research and see what you think. I bought in at close to the ATH but am not concerned at all as it's a long term hold for me and I'm confident they're going to do very well.

Another low cap coin I'm keen on is MyWish btw (although I think it has a cap of over 30million so might not fit your criteria).",1524478076
"I know this is probably not possible to answer, but how much of a token's or coin's value is affected by its actual use, and how much is affected by people who trade (short, long or hodl term)?

I read through Basic Attention Token FAQ and I quite like their honesty, it kind of outlines that the BAT value is not neccessarily anything but a token to enforce the platform itself. It is straight forward. So I naturally wonder, how much of a token's value is purely based on its popularity among traders and social media? 

So if we take Bitcoin which actually is something people use and have been using to purchase stuff, wouldnt it be safe to assume that the prices that happened during november-december last year are because of a trader and not an actual user? Looking at the much less (in comparison) dramatic chart spanning from May till October last year, the average price of Bitcoin was around 3k. Is that a much truer look at its value if you remove most of trader effect, based solely on last 12 months?

Which brings me to the next point: when looking for coins to invest in, and assuming that tokens and coins that are barely used or used at all, which ones will be the most popular? The best bet is probably on those that will be most popular AND will have a practical use. Which again removes most of the tokens because their usage will be minimal? How much VEN will actually be needed for someone to operate through the system? How much BAT? Etc... Are there any reason the tokens would rise in value?

Eth is a good example I guess, because it is used both in various games and purchasing ICO tokens. But how much of ETH value is its actual use directed by demand, and how much of it is popularity from a trader/token-investor point of view?

If miners would constantly sell their mined bitcoin and fee rewards as they receive them the market price would be a lot lower as there would be a lot more selling pressure on the market. Miners do have to sell some to cover expenses. (unless you are Bitmain) but they still have to make a mid term gamble on the price. I would say a 1 to 2 year gamble. Miners from the past that did not sell their coins when it was unprofitable to mine, might now find that in the end their mining operation was profitable. But of course this all depends on the unknown future.  Long term I think that most miners realize that if Bitcoin does not achieve adoption, eventually the speculation will end and all of crypto will die a slow death which would mean we would for the first time see a massive drop in hashrate. Eventually the max hashrate will be found, it can not increase for ever. A plateau will be reached and it's likely that in the course of history it will crash down once in a while. Since the coin release half ever 4 years this also puts more and more pressure on miners to support adoption wherever they can since their future revenue will depend on it. ",1524476862

But to give you a hint of an answer; if cryptocurrency can dis-intermediate the banks and even government, then the carbon footprint will be very much well worth it, and lead to a net carbon reduction.   The Banking and Government industrial complex has essentially infinite means to burn carbon.  Wars, oil wells, big companies...these are not low-carbon things.   Cryptocurrency's carbon footprint only looks large because you're comparing it to relatively small things.   This is world changing technology (and if it isn't, it needs to die.)",1524476768

The characteristics and innovation of Bingo Coin.

1. Adopt similar block design to achieve high expansion.

At present, it is more common to store the information of all aspects on one chain in the main block chain application design. But the problem is that it doesn't really meet the needs of the practical application, and it can create obstacles to future application speed expansion, program optimization, and sustainability.


The design concept of building blocks is a milestone concept of Bingo Coin. Divide the whole system into one layer, like a block of bricks. To solve the problems of application and intelligent contract respectively.


In Bingo ""platform, global legally gaming licences by all of the casino, game makers, such as gaming mediation can be on the platform, together to form the perfect business gambling new ecological, to provide users with high quality security decentralized gaming application platform. Global users are free to participate in gambling or self-organizing in Bingo Coin according to local laws and regulations.


In Bingo ""service system, including a comprehensive range of underlying network platform, and support to the third party access, in view of the world all licensed casino, game makers provide intelligent contract template and a series of components, reduce its online development threshold; For global gaming intermediaries, Bingo Coin will provide intelligent distribution systems that comply with local laws and regulations, including user overview, offline management, commission setting, financial ledger and other functions. In terms of offline development, Bingo Coin will also use the digital token and the licensed casino to use counter exchange and joint venture to cooperate.

Explore the philosophical balance between regulation and freedom.

In my opinion, Bingo Coin has a deep thinking about how to balance users and regulation, which makes it different.


It is well known that the core idea of block chain is decentralization, but there is no denying that centralization is still the main mode of social operation. The decentralization of thinking will inevitably block chain and traditional centralized regulation between conflict and friction, especially in the field of national policy is more outstanding, whether today or in the future, it is very difficult for governments to take the initiative to support gambling transactions without any supervision.


On this issue, Bingo ""has carried on the rational examination, and make the new thinking, took a more robust practical compromise strategy, it was assumed that technical need to be decentralized way to do this, but does not mean that is completely deregulation.


In the design philosophy of Bingo Coin, the regulatory requirements are fully considered, and the privacy of users is considered as far as possible, and the optimal balance between them is managed. For example, if necessary and voluntary, users can choose to submit information such as KYC (customer identity) and AML (capital flow) to meet the most basic regulatory requirements. All of this is intended to make blockchain gaming more acceptable and accessible to mainstream communities.


It is conceivable that Bingo Coin will be more likely to cooperate with the government in the future than the near-utopian ideal of bitcoin, and the resistance will be smaller in centralised organizations.


My view is that digital currency itself is a social problem, more and more involved in the whole in the operation of the society, to face up to history advance resistance that may arise during the process, with fusion point of view to explore, is more sensible behavior.",1524476279

The Blockchain technology however has a great future regardless of the prices of the coins. For example the Ethereum project especially has a great ecosystem in place which can be a model for future markets using the blockchain technology. What some people don't seem to understand however is that this doesn't necessarily mean that the currency Ether has to  have a ""high"" price for this to work, it could literally just be 50$ and it would be fine.

&gt; No, the 99% comes from Satoshi, not by commit count but by the actual importance for Bitcoin as a working electronic cash system.

""Electronic cash system"" would be no particular cool achievement, it's been done by many before (banks, VISA, MasterCard, ...). The cool aspect is the ""peer-to-peer electronic cash system"" Satoshi envisioned. The ""peer-to-peer"" aspect is much forgotten today, neither BTC nor BCH are strengthening it.

The rest of your statement is much political: you can of course assume that the only relevant parts of Bitcoin are from Satoshi. 

I don't agree, of course, and I'm pretty confident he would neither. Bitcoin was and is a community effort, driven by some guys who have dedicated incredibly much work into it.

"I understand your rant about the shitcoin communities and how we should be more open to the ideas and goals of other coins and tokens. Although I do not think it will stand much in the way of the success of cryptocurrency in general. 

Your first point about it not being user friendly is actually quite valid. However, your title suggests that it is one of the reasons that crypto will fail on short term. As you say you are holding 15 different coins I guess that title is more clickbait than your actual opinion. My opinion is that the whole crypto economy is only at the beginning and its full potential is huge compared to where it is now. The reason for this is the same as why you think it will fail. Crypto is not user friendly, it is difficult to fully understand and the sheer amount of projects is confusing. When we progress over time, you will see that these issues will be addressed by different projects. You see that more exchanges are creating fiat gateways, making it easier to directly buy the coin you want. The user interface of the different exchanges are being improved a lot. Compare Mt Gox interface with the current Binance app and you know what I mean. The more easy it becomes, the more people will get involved. 

I like to compare these kind of technological innovations with mobile phones. In the beginning nobody saw the need to own one. Later nobody saw the benefit of internet on their phone. You couldn’t read anything from the small screen anyway. Doing your banking on a mobile phone was even more useless, even dangerous and unsafe. Now 20 years later (or at least since my first phone) I trade crypto’s on that thing. The whole crypto economy will evolve similar to your mobile phone.

"Define high price. The high IQ crowd suspected that bitcoin would not just die out and will at least hit close to its all time high again, nano tends to thrive in bull markets and suffer terribly in bear markets. I have a small amount of nano (13.7 if I remember correctly) that was purchased at above 30 dollars. I have no doubt that just due to bitcoin alone, and the nature of nano in a bull market, it shouldn't be hard to get rid of that. It's only been 4 months of bag holding for those 13.7 nano and you know, if it climbs above 40 which is not much above that all time high, then it actually would have ended up being a good investment. Say bitcoin goes on a bull run and hits its ATH in June this time around, that could be a nice 25% profit in 6 months, 10% is considered alright in the stock market for an entire year. So if you are bagholding at 30 it doesn't really have to outperform its previous ATH by all that much for it to be considered a good investment.

Now all that being said we could be waiting until Christmas, but the signs are pointing to a bull run like the last one we had and if we're at 8000 now, imagine how high it will be if the bull run is on Christmas. This is not even shilling at this point, just evidence that even 30 dollar nanos could end up having performed well as an investment asset, overall in a yearly cycle.

* Time at the checkout-lane is precious. Merchants will need to be informed immediately or won't notice. This means that wallets would need some real-time flashy ""something odd happens"" information. Not existing, to my knowledge.
* Even then, there is a chance of false positives for accidental duplicate spends (wallet trouble, ...)

"Without a full node, I've been benefiting from Bitcoin plenty. I've been showing people how easy sending Bitcoin is via a lite wallet, I've had them get on board using the same lite wallets, and I've never had the need to run my own node. I know that there are tens of thousands of miners around the world securing and validating transactions, and as more people adopt it and get involved, the economic incentive will balance more miners joining the fray.

Since non mining nodes are so cheap in comparison, I'd argue that its easier to spoof thousands of those to create a fake consensus, than to fake legitimate hashpower. That will enable the banks to dictate Bitcoin at a much cheaper cost, than spending infinitely more on hashpower rigs.

Is that an incorrect assumption? Especially when you consider half the world population couldn't ever afford to run even one node themselves?

As for people leaving BTC, you just need to open your eyes and see the adoption stagnating. Look at the transactions... They hit the wall and dropped off immediately. It's the only reason it's now usable again in reality, since Segwit adoption isn't anywhere near where it needs to be.

&gt; I think that's wrong, because there's currently no technical solution to alert the merchant that something fishy is going on.

Then you need to study more I think.

Literally anyone with a node can provide this alert.  Bitcoin XT implemented double-spend alerting years ago.  IT is being worked on / enhanced for BCH.

To make your attack possible requires a complicit miner who will hide the double-spending transaction until he mines a block.  Otherwise any merchant can reliably find out about the doublespend in a matter of a second or two.  You would be far better off just shoplifting, or making some fake bills.

Now let's say you have a complicit miner.  If your complicit miner happens to mine the next block after your doublespend attempt, then he includes your fraudulent transaction, and you win.    But if anyone else mines the next block, then you paid for your goods fair and square.

"&gt; Can you explain about the 85% of the economy running a full node? Why is that important?

Without your own full node, you are not benefiting from Bitcoin at all. Light wallets are essentially just using a trusted third party as a bank.

If too few people use their own full node, on the other hand, the security of the overall network is compromised, since those third parties control the perception of their users. The rare user with a full node might reject an invalid block, and he can argue that he is the only one on the correct chain, but what good is that if the rest of the economy rejects his coins? At the end of the day, if the full node users are a minority, the centralised/trusted banks will win out economically when it comes down to it.

&gt; But now that everyone has left BTC for other coins

If you actually believe this, you're just plain delusional.

&gt; Ahhh, but the person committing zero conf fraud is going to get caught 100% of the time in a matter of seconds, ...

I think that's wrong, because there's currently no technical solution which would alert the merchant, that something fishy is going on.

Or it's not going well because the transaction seems to be stuck: then the fraud simply claims that there is some network / wallet / BCH / ... issue, pay cash and be off.

&gt; ... unless he has a complicit miner.

Complicit miners aren't needed. If a miner sees more than one transaction spending the same UTXO he has two options: either, ignore them both =&gt; this means for the merchant, that his transaction won't be confirmed and he makes a 100% loss. Or, the miner confirms one of the transactions =&gt; this means for the merchant a 50% chance to get money (two duplicate spends) or less (more duplicate spends). No evil miner needed.

&gt;&gt; Secondly, and more important: have you seen how many in this forum are dreaming of 0-confs as an online payment method?

&gt; No, I've been part of this forum for years, and primarily zero conf is the ""coffeeshop"" payment method.

0-confs online, e.g.: https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8dvx15/bitpay_spair_can_you_guys_clarify_why_you_dont/
0-confs unattended, e.g.: https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8drmbc/does_bch_atm_offer_0conf/

If you have already read Mastering Bitcoin by Andreas Antonopoulos, we suggest you take a look at books written on Ethereum. It is the biggest platform for dAPPs and Smart Contracts and will give you another view of how the blockchain can be used. 

Unfortunately there are not many great books written on the subject as it is such a new technology. Many of the books written on the topic are writing on the potential of the blockchain rather than the technical aspects of it. There is one book we suggest you read, namely Mastering Ethereum also written by Andreas Antonopoulos which will come out around August this year. This means you will have to wait a bit, but based on the quality of his previous books it will be well worth the wait.
