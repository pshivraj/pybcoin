"I‚Äôm all for ideas. But why would one want to keep their crypto in a banks wallet instead of their own? 

Yes you can offer interest on CD acc but that would mean the Bank has to invest that crypto somewhere to make a profit even after paying apr to consumer. Where would you invest the crypto that would net you more crypto?

Essentially you‚Äôll only be trading alts with other people‚Äôs bitcoin and hope you‚Äôre good enough to increase your bitcoin holdings and be able to pay interest and make profit.

He and/or his PR agents use a number of sock-puppet accounts on social media to push the idea that he *is* Satoshi even though all evidence points to him being a fraud.

Nick Szabo is an actual expert in this field who some have suggested over the years might be the real Satoshi. Although he denies it. 

The two of them has some sort of disagreement last year, which the OP has chosen to present as a screenshot rather than a link, to make it as hard as possible for people to dig back and see the context.

The screenshot ends with Doctor Professor Craigtoshi implying that he has archived conversations with Nick Szabo, which show Nick is not knowledgable about Bitcoin. The following reply appears to be unavailable, so my best guess is that Craig accidentally typed ‚ÄúHow to fake tweet archives‚Äù into twitter rather than google, then deleted the tweet after realising his mistake.

"&gt;Last summer I put 2mBTC for long term hodling in a breadwallet. I needed to move them now so I entered the seed in https://iancoleman.io  

Your whole story is BS.  
- first you say I put 2mbtc on breadwallet  
- secondly you say ""I generated in your phone"" but with what? with breadwallet or iancoleman?  
- then you say: I entered the seed into iancoleman **to move** the coins. That's fucking stupid, iancoleman is a wallet generator not a way to send/receive btc.  
- your phone too could be infected with a keylogger

You a good advice?  
1. Use iancoleman offline or using a LiveCD OS (tails) and generate a BIP39 segwit wallet  
2. Write the seed on a piece of paper  
3. Save also some first 10 BTC addresses generated in a text file and the Xpub, just to have them to check your integrity of generation  
4. Open on your mobile Samourai wallet  
5. Use the generated seed (weith iancoleman) to recover your segwit wallet into Samourai  
6. Check if the receiving address/xpub is the same you saved into the txt file  
7. Optional you could use the same seed into Electrum desktop wallet to recover and use the SAME wallet. When you recover use the options BIP39 with derivation path 49.

"&gt; IOTA and Nano have been operating as scams in my (and many other people's) view. IOTA still has major bugs despite being out for over a year. Nano went through a name change (Deceptive behavior) in an attempt to look like a new coin to pump it up. Also, despite them being out for so long, 70% of IOTA trading is on two exchanges, and 80% of Nano trading is on one exchange.

So, IOTA and NANO are scams because

1. IOTA still has bugs
2. They are only out on 1 exchange after 10 months and 13 months
3. Nano rebranded

None of these points make a coin a scam, not even close. Yes, IOTA still has bugs, but that doesn't make it a scam either. Also, both coins are on 5 exchanges, not 1, and these exchanges are the largest that currently exist (Binance, OKEX, Bitfinex)

&gt; It's still Distributed, which is what Bitcoin's goal was in the first place. ""Decentralization"" is a buzzword coined by people like Blockstream/Core trying to start a fight where one needn't exist. The whitepaper mentions it being ""distributed,"" nowhere does it say ""decentralized."" In order for something to be decentralized, it must first be centralized. Bitcoin had always been a distributed peer to peer electronic cash system, until the banking interests funded Blockstream/Core. No one mining pool, let alone miner, controls the network, therefore it is distributed.

Ok, but that isn't what people care about anymore. A currency that can maintain 100,000 TPS, which is truly decentralized will win over a currency that is controled &gt;51% by only a handful of entities. 

&gt;In order for something to be decentralized, it must first be centralized.

Theoretically yes and it's understandable if it is within the first year. However, if it still is extremely centralized after 10 years, there is a problem.

It also started promoting a different ticker symbol from the initial 'BCC'.

https://archive.is/https://bcash.io

You can find snapshots at web.archive.org too.

On Twitter, a '@bcash' account appeared, doing the same misdirection to bcash.io website. It also featured a revised logo that looked very different from the Bitcoin Cash logo on the bitcoincash.org website. At the same time, the 
social media accounts heavily promoted the alternative name 'bcash'. It was clear that this promotion campaign had nothing to do with those who created Bitcoin Cash, but was just meant to disorient and confuse the public.

Due to a quirk of history, the 'BCC' ticker originally chosen was a bad choice, since it was already used by Bitconnect, which subsequently experienced a big growth (unanticipated at the time) and so most people decided to go with the 'BCH' ticker which was initially promoted by the 'bcash' adversaries.

TL;DR : there was clear evidence of a malevolent campaign against the Bitcoin Cash fork, conducted under the banner of the 'bcash' name, with professionally set up presences (domains, githubs, twitter accounts, immediate day one promotion by strong opponents of the big block fork) etc.

This is why the Bitcoin Cash community strongly rejected the 'bcash' label.",1524116911

For example, the price started to crash at least in part because transaction fees were way to high and the network couldn't handle that volume. But finally segwit and lightning have been activated. So a correction and volatility actually contributed to the overall improvement of the system.


According to Taleb, the current debt based economy is fragile and all it will take for it to unravel is a small shock.


What a lot of new bitcoiners don't understand is Bitcoin was designed for financial crisis, it has never seen a downturn since it's creation whilst at the same time the infrastructure for institutions to jump in is now there.

"That‚Äôs when u realize that all his rhetoric is pure bs, hea treating that as a business - as his business - and indeed seems like he owns everyone in there. I have never seen someone like him in all this years talking about bitcoin. This guys makes it look centralized as fuk",1524116612
"&gt; I don't like Bitcoin Cash because of how centralized it is. 

What makes you thing that Bitmain has more hash power on the Bitcoin-BCH chain then at the Bitcoin-BTC chain? 

Have you considered the possibility that at this stage both are equally centralised in term of hash power until the jump in improvement of every new ASIC slows down ... and different companies also start producing ASIC's? 

Do you know that if Bitmain could, they would not sell a single ASIC but all use them to mine with them themselves.

You know why they don't do that? Because that would be a long term risk for the succes of the project. This is why pools make sure they never go above 30%. 

We will be stuck in this phase for a while. Yes, Bitmain could attack Bitcoin-BTC and Bitcoin-BCH easily because of how much control they have. On the other hand there are people like Theymos that also have an incredible amount of control. That's also centralisation. 

None of this are reasons to pick Bitcoin-BTC over Bitcoin-BCH.  If this is a problem for you, you should not be in Bitcoin or crypto period.  But for now it's not a problem since crypto is still 99% speculation and hardly any meaningful adoption. Bitmain is just a money making machine and they don't want to risk that going away. So they sell their ASIC's after mining with them themselves. It's in their long term interest that other people also get this ASIC's because otherwise when enough people reason: ""Well Bitmain has 90% of the hashrate so I am not going to play in this game"" then that would be the end of Bitcoin and also the end of the profits that Bitmain is making right now. 

Eventually a upper limit of raw hash power will be found, it cannot not grow indefinitely. The performance jump between two generations of ASIC,s will become smaller each new generation untill that also evens out. 

Bitcoin prices at the moment are a result of market manipulation since the market on the crypot side is 100% unregulated. 

So eventually prices will again go low enough that a lot of miners will have to stop mining. Long term, since the byproduct of Bitcoin mining is heat, this will reverse in to electrical heating with Bitcoin mining  as the by product. Heat from asic chips is between 90 - 105 degrees which is ideal for heating up water in homes. 

That's all long term. None of that will happen if Bitcoin does not see the adoption it will need to turn in to a real currency. 

LN is a solution to something that is not a problem. Bitcoin can scale fine as it is, easily to 100 million tx a day. 

The question is, why would it scale up so high? How is it going to scale up that high? Because with just using it as a tool for speculation, it will never ever have the need to scale up that high.

And so what Bitcoin is doing, only has hurt adoption. This is why if Bitcoin is going to succeed it will not be through the route of Bitcoin core ... that's a dead end.

However, pools could still mine empty blocks to oppose this scaling solution in its current form, since that has nothing to do with AsicBoost. It is an interesting situation, but it appears ASICBoost technology is no longer a threat.

"The number of coins can be a good assessment of risk and possible gains.  A project with 10 billion coins take a lot of volume to increase the price and a lot of volume in dumping to sink the price making for a pretty secure and low risk investment even for the most popular coins (see xrp or Ada for example). A low amount of coins with a low marketcap means it takes little money to pump or dump price, and your risk in losing money is much higher, but your possible gains are also larger (nano would be a good example here and there many others). Bitcoin and ethereum are exceptions in that they have low supply and giant marketcaps and take lots of money to move price.  ",1524113373

**2018 Cryptocurrency Crash (Elliott Wave): 420 High**


Crosspost: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2711461.msg34761393#msg34761393


April 20th (i.e. 420) ‚Äî An international counterculture holiday, where advocates gather protesting in civil disobedience to celebrate and consume recreational drugs. Counterculture currencies are also seeing fractals and getting ‚Äòhigh‚Äô.

Since the April Fools' low of 6245 (Bitfinex), the Bitcoin market has rallied 30% thus far. 

The upward price spike on 12-APR saw a 20% gain in a single day on heavy volume. The rapid move caught the bulls by surprise with the majority disengaged in the rise as indicated by the BTCUSDLONGS index, which declined on the day instead of surging upwards to correlate with price action. It appears the price spike has been exacerbated by a short-covering rally squeezing out bearish positions as indicated by the BTCUSDSHORTS index which collapsed 40%.

Quite an April Fools‚Äô which has stoned both the bulls &amp; bears. As of yet, there still doesn‚Äôt appear to be any news correlation as a driver for the price spike which is quite unusual.

It was initially assumed that the rally from the 01-APR low was retracing the decline from 21-MAR, and the magnitude of such a wave limited to circa 20% representing a Fibonacci 38.2% retrace. However, the magnitude of the rally has thus far exceeded the mid-March rally which saw price appreciate 27%. Consequently, it appears the current rally is actually retracing the larger decline from 05-MAR to 01-APR; and subsequently, a degree adjustment to the Elliott Wave model is required.

From the 6245 low set on 01-APR, the Bitcoin market rallied 17% and then gave up 13% of those gains before trading sideways in a choppy 10-day affair. On 12-APR, the market broke out of that range and has thus far rallied 25%. A net gain of approx 30% so far. The meandering price action prior to the breakout price spike has been identified as a Symmetrical Triangle pattern, where consolidating and tightening price gave way to the breakout.

The following are Fibonacci retracements of the 05-MAR-2018 to 01-APR-2018 decline of where the current trip may peak:

Lower Range

     @8440: 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the wave from 05-MAR-2018 to 01-APR-2018.
     @9063: 50% Fibonacci retracement of the wave from 05-MAR-2018 to 01-APR-2018.

Upper Range

     @9685: 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the wave from 05-MAR-2018 to 01-APR-2018.
     @9946: 50% Fibonacci retracement of entire Bitcoin market.

With rising price creating negative divergences against a declining overbought RSI on the 4-hr timeframe, and already reaching the initial target of 8440; the rally is looking baked and may complete within the aforementioned Lower Range targets, where the average is 8752.

Currently, taking out 8032 would indicate weakening upside momentum.

When the high wears off, a sober market is expected to resume towards 4257 which represents the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement of the entire Bitcoin market. Should the price range of 15-APR mark the high, then a decline to 4257 would be a Fibonacci 0.786% extension of the decline from 05-MAR-2018 to 01-APR-2018 ‚Äîwonderous phinance!

"Unfortunately, defining things like this isn't as exact a science as chemistry.  12/17 could very well have been the tipping point from Early Majority to Late Majority or maybe we haven't even entered Late Majority territory just yet. To be perfectly honest we could still be in Early Majority territory right now and may not leave it for another 5 years.  

We won't know for sure where we are now until after Middle America starts using Bitcoin because there are still quite a few people on the other side of the Dgiital Divide who don't really use the Internet and therefore don't have ready access to the information needed to make an informed choice about cryptocurrency in general.

There are people in Africa who are jumping on the crypto movement because they are leaping past decades of technological progress due to globalization.  There are more people in Kenya with cellphones, for instance, than indoor plumbing.  Crypto is a huge boon to people in that kind of a situation and they are more able to work around banks whereas Industrialized nations have an uphill fight against heavily entrenched interests that exercise vast control over all facets of everyday life.

"**Chargeback fraud**

Chargeback fraud, also known as friendly fraud, occurs when a consumer makes an online shopping purchase with their own credit card, and then requests a chargeback from the issuing bank after receiving the purchased goods or services. Once approved, the chargeback cancels the financial transaction, and the consumer receives a refund of the money they spent. When a chargeback occurs, the merchant is accountable, regardless of whatever measures they took to verify the transaction.

"I'll admit you're right on gold's volatility, but it's far more stable than fiat in my opinion. Fiat essentially always depreciates, and arguably it can be even more volatile depending on how Keynesian the people behind it are.

&gt;With 70% of more of the haspower in half a dozen pools, the protocol is no longer secure.

It makes no difference whether it's three, ten or a million pools. The second the miners in a pool stop getting paid is when they stop sharing their hashpower. That's why 51% attacks for the purpose of bringing down the network are completely null; they take effect for a few hours at most before the majority of miners just give up trying to get paid. 

If a government tried this, they'd only manage to dump the price a modest amount from the few transactions they could pull of in that time. They can not change the protocol or create new coins in any way. It is economically infeasible that anyone would try it, unless a serious flaw in the hash algorithm is found and exploited.

&gt;Miners and pools have already chosen to do things that were against the interest of users, such as keeping the 1 MB block size limit and implementing SegWit. They did that because the hodlers and traders who determine the price of bitcoin could not care less for its users.

The miners choose to mine whatever is the most profitable, which is what they should be doing. Those issues are because of c**ns***hip and therefore users believing in inferior tech. There is no reason to blame the miners here, especially considering that most of them have to constantly re-invest what they earn in more hardware to increase profits.

&gt;Only criminal or fraudulent merchants see payment reversals as a big problem.

Without it Bitcoin would not be useful in the first place. Obviously not everyone who likes Bitcoin is a criminal or a fraud, there is just a lot of utility in not having to risk your funds being seized or having your payments reversed when some authority decides. 

And even if payment reversals are useful - they can still be done with Bitcoin with Blockchain audits and voluntary agreements from merchants. All it would take is a trusted third-party as with fiat, but very few people are in Bitcoin for that reason at the moment.

&gt;On the contrary, payment reversals are essential to protect customers against fraudulent merchants, theft, and errors. 

If that is the case there will be a market for it eventually, but that's not the case. Censorship resistance and knowing full well that transactions are final is much more efficient than depending on an authority. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chargeback_fraud

And these chargebacks and payment reversals are unreliable without giving away much of your private information, another area in which Bitcoin soars.

&gt;Check the USAF coup attempt. It depended on Core sympathizers controlling most of the non-mining relays that Core clients would be connected to. The cost for setting up a non-mining relay being very small, one could subvert the network (as the UASFers intended) with very little investment.

Non-mining nodes do not validate transactions, this was essentially just an attempt to convince users into a separate fork with transactions incompatible with previous versions. This was in no way a sybil attack on Bitcoin.

The orphan rate for bitcoin was ~1% (~1.5 per day) until Dec/2015.  Starting Jan/2016, the main pools started using a more efficient block transmission protocol (FIBRE), and the orphan rate dropped to 0.1% or so. 

Satoshi set the interval to 10 minutes because he assumed that there would be thousands of independent miners, mostly running the software on PCs or laptops.  Then it would take tens of seconds for a block to propagate to a a majority of the hashpower.  In today's reality, however, propagation is much faster.  Each  major pool is probably connected directly to all the others, so there is no real propagation involved.  Thus, if one does not mind the concentration of mining power, today one should set a much lower block interval.",1524109726

That said, I think you could use some more info on BCH as it seems you may not know all the details. 

Check out [BCH development](https://cash.coin.dance/)! You can get a birds eye view of all the stuff going on currently as well as a look into how the nodes are configured and distribution of BCH node software development. 

I'll point out that on the BCH dev page you'll find a ""+"" button near the bottom. Here you can submit your own proposal for BCH development (if you have the skills, or work with a team that does). Then the community can review and vote on it :) 

You'll then notice that there is no ""Development"" page for BTC, this is simply because BTC has only one developing team, Bitcoin Core (BlockStream). And there's no way to submit your own proposals or to have any say in what happens without first going through Blockstream. 

If you'd like to try, you can submit your proposals to the current dev team (Blockstream) [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips#readme). Here's a note from the page:

&gt;People wishing to submit BIPs, first should propose their idea or document to the bitcoin-dev@lists.linuxfoundation.org mailing list. After discussion, please open a PR. **After copy-editing and acceptance**, it will be published here.

"Misleading

Let's be real here: they accept FIAT not Bitcoin. They have a payment provider that converts the customers Bitcoins into FIAT. They never touch the poop, ever. 

This is true for all the Lambo dealerships too.",1524108910
"So the idea is to allow transactions to happen at a store in real life without having to wait for the transaction to confirm. It was first introduced by satoshi himself on the bitcointalk forums.

**With real confirmations on the chain, there is still a small statistical chance a competing chain of blocks passes the chain your transaction is in.**

This is how the network handles blocks being produced at the same time at different points in the network. The chain that eventually gets the most hash power becomes the official chain. The competing ordering of blocks dies out. The more confirmations you get (blocks after your block), the more trusted the tx is. That's why you see exchanges wait for 3-6 confirmations. If the blocks aren't full and the chain is functioning normally, all unconfirmed tx in the mempool will get into the next block (or the block after if you happened to send it out as a new block got mined).

**You can also trust an unconfirmed tx as long as it gets into the mempool of the miners. Any double spend attempts for txs already in the mempool will be rejected by the miner.**

All the merchant needs to do is watch for a double spend until their tx gets into the mempools of all of the miners. The danger with 0-conf tx happens if your tx goes into miner A's mempool and miner B didn't get it yet, but miner B heard about the double spend tx. If miner B happens to mine a block first, the double spend will be successful. If the merchant sees an attempted double spend on the network they can not give the item to the customer. The merchant's point-of-sale server (the boxes you normally swipe visa cards in) will do the watching and alerting, just like it does now when it authorizes with a bank if you're using visa.

**How long does the merchant need to watch? Longer is better, but it's only a few seconds depending on the item.** 

Obviously for buying a house you would want to wait for confirmations. More confirmations is more trust a competing chain of events never out competes your chain of events. Coffee? It would probably cost you more in business to make the customers wait an hour for 6 confirmations than it would if they just stole the coffee. The point of sale server should let the merchant pick how long to wait (or whether to wait for confirmations) depending on what they sell.

**Why is it only a few seconds?** 

The miners are financially incentivized to connect to every other mining node (1 mining node = 1 mining pool). If some other mining node gets a block, they want to hear about it as soon as possible because if that new block used any of the tx that were in the block they were working on, they have to throw the block out and start again.

With them fully connected like that, the number of miners who hear your tx grows geometrically. For example, if one miner heard the tx, and he tells two miners - who tell two miners - who tell two miners... etc. After a few seconds all of the miners will have the tx in the mempool and double spends won't happen.

** Why should the merchant use Bitcoin Cash over Visa? **

They can accept payment in a few seconds from a customer. Using peer-to-peer electronic cash with no Visa middleman lets them go from 5% transaction fees to transaction fees &lt;$0.01 which are paid by the customer anyway. Instantly 1/20th more profitable on every sale.",1524108888

I did a lot of math to back this, and eventually the math convinced me unequivocally that bigger blocks were better at least to gigabyte levels.  I began posting about this including detailed arguments against and about my change of heart and the math.

I found comments of mine being silently removed all of a sudden, which had never happened before.  The breaking point was when I made a long comment that didn't say anything bad or rude or censorship-worthy and immediately checked and it wasn't there.  (Reddit hides removed comments from you, you have to check them incognito or logged out to see what other people see).  A few hours later the comment went from 1 vote to 0 votes, and I checked again and it was still gone.  In other words, a moderator of the subreddit read my comment, disliked / downvoted it, and left it removed.

I was pretty pissed then.  Two weeks later I was banned for a nonsense reason and I began to read what was really going on all this time.  It still makes me livid to think about the manipulation that has gone on for so long and irreversibly damaged Bitcoin.

"Folks - got a sort of a n00b question.  We know that we can follow bitcoin transactions maybe even to certain people.  How do you do this?

Elderly friend was threatened and intimidated on the phone enough to send scammers $15,500 in two transactions via bitcoin.  One transaction for $5,500 was straight into their wallet via QR Code.  The second one for $10,000 she screwed up at the machine and had a paper wallet created.   Like a good compliant citizen she listened to them and sent them a picture of that receipt with the public/private key.   They emptied that paper wallet as soon as they had that.

Anyhow - from the paperwallet I traced it back to the wallet they put it in and in there they have thousands of transactions and hundreds of bitcoins coming in (in smallish amounts) and then a few big transactions going out.

Would love to trace this further and see where it leads.  However, lack the technical knowledge to do so. Any thoughts on this?",1524105895

However, just to pay devil's advocate about the word scam, since it's very liberally used on many coins these days, the fact that they have basically spent zero time on marketing this for the last 6 years makes it a very poorly run scam. A scam coin needs to make heavy claims, market it like crazy then quickly exit. 

There's really no point to develop for six years, create a new consensus model, sell and deliver hardware nodes to hundreds testers, attend conferences around the world, do interviews with crypto influencers, all so they can finally scam.

This project may fail, however it will be because of the ambitious scope and not because it's a scam.

The number of coins in circulation really doesn‚Äôt alter my decision in the slightest if I‚Äôm comparing 2 coins. The only thing I‚Äôm looking at in regards to circulating supply is the relation of circulating to max supply. When it comes to the number of coins it just ends up being all relative in that people are generally investing based off total usd or btc amount.

"I'd say I usually have 2-10% of my total portfolio value in FIAT, which I adjust depending on market conditions. so when we we're really bullish I wasn't so concerned  to invest more and just saved up money outside of crypto for investment down the road. But if that's not possible DCA sells when we are deep into an overheated bull market like dec-jan so you have more cash to invest when we pullback (easier said than done but remember markets are cylical). Of course this is risky if you time it wrong so only use 10-20% of your stack, i'd say 50% max if you're extremely confident but don't get ahead of yourself. At least this way if you time it wrong you simply take some nice profits and still have a stake in  the market. Then when the market looks is down and shows signs of recovery you could scale back in and DCA your investments to a much lower level. Most of it is psychological IMO, buying in a downmarket or selling in a heated bull market is the hardest hurdle for an investor to overcome but once you get the gist you'll always live by these habits and be better off from it.

"The problem is one of accumulation. Let's say that the storage for all transactions for a year is 1 ""space"".

The first year the cost for a full node is 1 space, whatever that cost at the time. The next year it will become 1 + 1 = 2 space (whatever that costs the second year). This goes on so year 50 a full node is 50 space, and transactions from year one are still costing money. Storage cost is going down but there is a physical limit.

One would think that it would be easy to prune out dead transactions but apparently not.

So the concern here is that running a full node doesn't make money in itself. But it is a requirement for miners to operate but they are of course making money off of transactions. Eventually most people won't be able to run a full node and will drop out.

Miners will afford it but eventually they are going to want to centralize their full nodes so they have a few of them as possible in the pool. Eventually smaller pools will have to consolidate because even though they can carry the cost it is eating into their profits.

If we want micro transactions to work I think we want to be able to make payments of 1 cent. That 1 cent transaction done 50 years ago will eventually become a burden. At least when competing with a solution that has less of that burden.

I believe I read somewhere that someone estimated that BTC would have to have a block size of 130MB to support a world wide use of BTC with LN as a second layer.

BCH would need at least one order of a magnitude more or even 3 orders of a magnitude if micro transactions are assumed.

BCH reminds me of a children's diddy in Sweden, which has the sentiment that peeing in bed feels good and warm, but after a while it gets cold and nasty, so better pee a little more. But of course, in the end you can't pee any more and then it gets really cold and nasty.

Over time though, things became better. Seeing a Bitcoin transaction go through and be confirmed (when Lightning does work) in under a second is a magical sight.

I understand what Bitcoin Cash is, and you can do the exact same things on Bitcoin that you can do with Bitcoin Cash. I don't like Bitcoin Cash because of how centralized it is. I see Bitcoin as the only truly decentralized digital currency. If the block size of Bitcoin (BTC) must be raised in the future, then it will be raised. However, side chains must be given a fair shot. There is no reason every single coffee transaction in the whole world must be stored indefinitely on the Bitcoin blockchain.

I have participated in the scaling debate since 2014 though not with this Reddit handle. Segwit is not a necessity for scaling by any means.  Not even the core-devs would have made that argument back in the day.  They said segwit was necessary as a soft fork to avoid splitting the community.  The need for segwit was to fix transaction malleability to make 2nd layer solutions easier to implement. Doing it as a soft fork was a kludge that they argued was necessary because it needed to be a soft fork.

Big blockers for years tried to scale the blocksize and made many arguments for how to scale.  The scaling debate went on for years.  In desperation, Gavin release bitcoin XT, and Theymos responded censoring and banning all the big-blockers on r/bitcoin.  The small blockers actively told us to split and we big blockers have done so.  Now the small blockers post trolling comments constantly on r/btc and big blockers have gotten used to the trolls.  

I actually think that this constant trolling from small blockers is one of bch's largest advantages. Bitcoin was designed to be anti-fragile and every attack against it that is weathers makes it stronger.   r/btc has grown to 200k subscribers against constant social attack.

"&gt; The volatility is not due to the issuance cap, it's to do with it being apart of the few unregulated markets in the world and it's low adoption

The issuance cap created the expectation that the price would ""go to the Moon"" in some indefinite future.  That caused people to buy it as investment and hoard it, instead of using it as a currency.  That in turn caused the price to rise, which attracted even more hodlers. With 95% or more of the supply locked up in hoards, any small change in the gut feeling of the hodlers causes huge swings in the market price.  And these swings in turn have made use as a currency impossible -- except by the criminals, who depend on miners ignoring KYC/AML, and by a small number of fanatic believers.

&gt; Gold has a far more strict issuance rate yet is one of the most stable assets

[That is ridiculously not true](http://www.macrotrends.net/1333/historical-gold-prices-100-year-chart).  And the supply of gold is practically unlimited; how much is mined each year is just a matter of market price.

Gold is in fact a commodity with a relatively stable final consumption (for jewelry and industry).  That consumption provides a floor price, that I guess is 300 USD/oz or less.  

The other 75% of the current market price is the result of hoarding and speculative trading, like occurs with bitcoin; and, like bitcoin, that component is extremely volatile and unpredictable.  

Bitcoin does not have a final consumption, and therefore its price is 100% determined by hoarding and speculative trading.

&gt; Mining centralization is not a problem

People say that only because there is no way to solve the problem, so they must pretend that it does not exist.

The security model of bitcoin depended totally on the assumption that mining would be dispersed among thousands of anonymous *independent* miners.  With 70% of more of the haspower in half a dozen pools, the protocol is no longer secure.  

&gt; there's no chance individual miners will take part in ruining their own investment.

Miners and pools have already chosen to do things that were against the interest of users, such as keeping the 1 MB block size limit and implementing SegWit.  They did that because the hodlers and traders who determine the price of bitcoin could not care less for its users.  

In fact, those developments happened only because mining was concentrated in a few pools, whose owners could be pressed, bribed, or blackmailed into acceptance.   In fact, every soft fork change to the protocol is a successful ""51% attack"" on it.

Thus one does not need any imagination to see what the concentration of mining means for the protocol.

&gt; as a merchant, irreversibility of transactions is a life-saver against thef

Only criminal or fraudulent merchants see payment reversals as a big problem.  Honest legal merchants have low rates of fraudulent reversals, because they can dispute the reversals with the card company and use the police to deter fraudulent ones.  

On the contrary, payment reversals are essential to protect customers against fraudulent merchants, theft, and errors.  The feature was not an imposition of the card companies and banks: it is a major hassle for them, which they must bear because otherwise no one would use their services.

&gt; I do not understand what part of Bitcoin you're referring to can be sybil attacks? 

Check the USAF coup attempt.  It depended on Core sympathizers controlling most of the non-mining relays that Core clients would be connected to.  The cost for setting up a non-mining relay being very small, one could subvert the network (as the UASFers intended) with very little investment.

&gt; Many people find those things to be benefits

Of course.  Even ransomware hackers think that ransomware is a benefit. 8-)

However, most people still see those illegal uses as very bad.  That is why they are illegal, and that is why the jackbooted gubmint thugs will want to stop them.",1524098220

"Currencies aren't tied to local economies in a direct sense. 

They are tied to the belief that the market has regarding the performance and management of the local economy that uses and manages that currency.

The reason why a specific currency is more valuable than others, lies in what the market believes that will be the performance of the local economy and how the ""local"" central bank manages the liquidity of that same currency in the world.

I say world because currencies aren't just used within the frontiers of the country that manages it. They could also be used abroad. It's just a matter of someone be allowed to accept it or not, but that's another story.

Depending on what cryptocurrency we look, they could have different values, because not all of them can be used in a generic way.
Still, the majority of the cryptos value is still very speculative.

Bitcoin economy for example, is still a drop in the enormous world economic ocean. There's no way that the current Bitcoin value reflects the real bitcoin economy and so, Bitcoin is currently valued by the belief that the future Bitcoin economy will be enormous, creating a high demand for coins.

The reason why one British Pound is worth more than one US Dollar, is because of the British pound liquidity. For you to buy goods in the United Kingdom, you need to buy them using British Pounds. That alone, creates the demand to buy British pounds at the market, using other currencies, such as the USD, or the Euro, or the Japanese Yen.

I like this and i enjoy the difference between bitcoin and ethereum smart contracts as well as their purpose. Makes me bullish on both.,1524095968
"It is a fork... Bitcoin as in Bitcoin Cash has had several forks in the past. They are standard software updates. Just recently Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash split due to difference in philosophy. Bitcoin Cash remained to scale on chain as per whitepaper and the original Bitcoin promise, while Bitcoin core decided to establish centralization by implementing Lightning Network. ",1524095938
"This is what I asked ‚ÄúOn StockTwits where I have been active since its inception regarding the general stock market, I saw ripple trending and was quite shocked to be honest. What in the world was that token doing on my StockTwits trending app?  I decided to make a post trying to educate the ‚Äúinvestors‚Äù that XRP is not a currency and the actual price is 3,428.57 USD (when you compare max supply to bitcoin‚Äôs 21 million) and simply appears as  .72 cents because of the 100 billion max supply.

A whole swath of people attacked me on the transaction speed and I refer them to the Lightening Network.  Where can we see verifiable proof of the LN working?

Can I setup two LN nodes and send BTC to myself to test it out? Has anyone done that? 

Thanks!",1524095926

The btc that I invested made me proffit and did a cashout so I could get my hair transplant. Haha",1524095874
"&gt; Lightning actually has worked for me for regular payments

That still does not make it a ""beta release"".  It is still ""toy implementation""

A ""beta release"" is a version of a software that is complete enough to be released to general users for real work, but has been only lightly tested and so it is released with caveats about possible *unknown* flaws, for users who are willing to run the risk in exchange of its features. 

The LN is not meant to be ""a system that can carry some payments between bitcoin believers"".   It is meant to be ""a system that can attract hundreds of millions of ordinary 'agnostic' users and carry many of their payments, better than bitcoin and similar systems"".    Since `lnd` can't get anywhere near that goal, it is still not a ""beta release"" of the LN.  It is not even an ""alpha release"", nor a ""prototype"", not even a ""proof of concept"".  

In fact the release is not even a useful test, because not even the devs can tell whether and how it is being used, how often it fails, etc.

&gt;  to receive credit card payments, you also have to be online, which hasn't prevented their use

Online merchants have to be online in order to sell, so indeed that is not a reason for them to reject credit cards or the LN.  However, that is an obstacle for non-merchants, who will be the vast majority of users.  In the current system, Alice gets her salary through bank deposit, and then spends it with credit cards.  To switch from credit cards to the LN, she must receive her salary through the LN too.  If she has to be online in order to receive her salary, that will be a problem...

Moreover Alice must keep her LN wallet on the same computer that she must keep online, increasing the risk of theft by hacking.

&gt; You can use a tool like Bosworth's HTLC payments to create liquidity in your own channels.

Can you give a link, or briefly explain how they work?

&gt; For the watchtowers, you say you have to ""trust"" them to stay online and watch for you. By the same measure you have to ""trust"" network nodes to propagate your payment even though they have no financial incentive to do so.

Indeed, and I have pointed out several times that the ""full but non-mining"" relay nodes (which were added by the cypherpunks after Satoshi left) completely break the security of the protocol, and should not exist.

But if the relay nodes fail to propagate your transactions, you don't lose coins, you just can't use the system; and you can always try other peers.  If your  Watcher is not actually watching, or fails to intervene as expected, your channels are not secure, but you don't know it; and you can lose money that you received through the LN.

&gt; You seem to think there will be some enormous fee for [watching]

No, I expect the fees to be small, too.  But paying those fees is another annoyance.  

Note that the Watcher needs to watch the blockchain for all possible stale checks that were issued previously through the channel, all the time -- even if the channel has not been used for six months, 

&gt; &gt;  +  The LN will not be usable until most bitcoin users have adopted it. If only half bitcoin users are on the LN, it may actually increase the on-chain traffic, instead of relieving it.

&gt; This would mean that the users taking advantage of it were spending additional  funds rather than less in order to do so

That is not what I meant.  If only half of the bitcoin users are LN users, there will be many cases where an LN user needs to pay a non-LN user, or vice-versa.  That would require closing or opening channels.  

In other words, the LN economy will be separated from the non-LN bitcoin economy by the expensive barrier of channel opening and closing.  Just as the bitcoin economy is separated from the fiat one by the need to trust centralized exchanges and payment processors -- and that visibly is an obstacle to their adoption.  The traditional fiat systems, in contrast, are all connected, with little or no ""border crossing"" fees.

&gt; Why would she be forced to receive her salary over LN?

Because nodes must be balanced in the long run, otherwise their channels would soon be exhausted.  

&gt;  use an HTLC payment to send whatever she wants to savings (giving her liquidity)

That would only transfer the problem to her savings ""bank"".  If the bank receives $3000 from Alice every month for safekeeping, diectly or indirectly, its incoming channels would soon be saturated.  Alice would have to create a new channel to the bank, funded with the $3000 of her salary that she 

If you split the LN nodes in two sets X, Y, the maximum net payment that can flow from X to Y is limited by the total capacity of the channels between the two sets.  Thus, there cannot be a set Y of nodes that persistently receives through the LN, from the other nodes X, more money than it sends to X.  

&gt; Trying to control who can or cannot connect to a widespread lightning network seems like an extremely difficult job.

An LN node that acts as intermediary in a multihop payment  from or to the US will almost surely be considered a money transmission business, and therefore will be required to register with the proper US authority and follow the KYC/AML rules.  A node who refuses to do so will be risking fines and/or jail.

The ""freedom"" and ""privacy"" that the LN fans see as an advantage is precisely what the KYC/AML rules were created to prevent.

&gt;  [Bankers] won't be able to [create money] with with lightning or bitcoin

Banks can't print dollar bills either, and yet they create new dollars all the same.  When Alice gives them $1000 in dollar bills, they invest that into (say) Apple shares, and then create an entry in *their* private ledger that says ""Alice has $1000 in her account"".  Alice can then buy a TV from Bob, who also has an account in the bank by asking the bank to move those virtual dollars to Bob≈õ  account.  Same thing, but a bit more complicated, if Bob has an account in some other bank.  Meanwhile Carlos, who sold the Apple shares to the bank for $1000 in cash, can also use those $1000 to but a drone from Dave.   

Thus the bank effectively created $1000, without printing any bills.  There is no stealing, because everybody who should have $1000 has that in some form -- cash, shares, TV, drone, or the legal right to receive $1000 from the bank.  And Alice actually finds it more convenient to pay with the bank's ""virtual"" dollars than with actual cash.  

If the economy went bitcoin, the banks would do exactly the same thing -- and Alice would find the ""virtual"" bank dollars more convenient (and even more safe) than actual bitcoins, or LN bitcoins.

&gt; Is privacy good or bad? 

The LN believers expect privacy (from law enforcement) because they believe it is good.  But privacy is bad because, if it works even partly, it will lead to banning the LN.  And in fact the LN users should not count on it, because there are tricks that can break it in many cases.

&gt; I did address that finding a route was done by the node sending the transaction rather than controlled by other in the network

That is not the point.  

In order for Alice to send a $500 payment to Zoe, she must first find a path in the network whose nodes are all online and willing to mediate, and whose hops (channels) still have at least $500 of capacity left in the proper direction. 

But she does not know the state of the nodes and channels beforehand.  So she must pick a path that *might* work, and try to send the payment through itt.  If some of the nodes fails to respond in due time or refuses, or some of the channels does not have enough capacity, she must remove those nodes and channels from her map of the network, and try again. 

No one knows how many paths will have to be tried before one is found.  No one knows how often such a $500 payment will fail, even though Alice and Zoe both have a channel with more than $500 of capacity. 

&gt; I find it ironic that you posted on r/btc as if this ""debunked"" my podcast, when none of these were the points I answered

OK, I admit that your article is not as misleading as many other LN articles out there.  However, by calling the criticisms ""FUD"" you are already implying that they are wrong -- and malicious to boot.   In the announcement above you even say that you were ""answering **all** the common FUD""...

The message of your article is that the LN may not be perfect now but there are no unsurmountable obstacles to its success.  That it is like electric cars  or a manned trip to Mars.  In fact it is more like the space elevator, or an artificial gill.  There are several unsolved show-stopping problems with it, that still have no solutions, and there is no reason to assume that they will be solved in any reasonable time frame.",1524095839

"Everybody does not  say ""BCH is a joke"". It's only the ones that have been misguided and confused.



Most BCHers don't care about the price. They care about BCH being able to scale, provide cheap transactions and be adopted. 

BCH has been hated by /r/Bitcoin because the mods censor pro-BCH posts and they even censored pro-bigblocks users and users that called out the mods for censoring in /r/Bitcoin.  At /r/CryptoCurrency IMO people don't like it because it did not give them lambos. I see a HODL culture here, so possibly that's one reason. The arguments against BCH that I have seen are all false accusations such as :

Roger Ver created Bcash

Jihan Wu created Bcash 

And so on



Yes, BCH is having a blocksize increase to 32MB and that does not necessarily mean everyone will have to mine 32MB blocks directly.

"&gt;No idea.

Bitcoin cash, contrary to any other cryptocurrency out there, withstands scrutiny. It delivers on the notion of peer-to-peer digital cash, it is the only currency out there right now designed to do so on a global scale. For me it is the only cryptocurrency with real utility that deserves to be called ""Bitcoin"". I can easily change my mind though if someone has any convincing counter arguments, but since November 2017 when I went all in BCH, I have not seen one single valid counter argument to this fundamental advantage BCH has. This is why Bitstamp, Coinbase, Bitpay never came as a surprise to me (aside from the timing, I didn't expect them to happen so quick). People who have been listening to Reddit/Twitter trolls, on the other hand, either got burned by selling it too soon (I wish I was one of the fortunate who got it for free) or never bought in and are stuck in the sidelines scratching their heads.

An easy way to put it is, retail investors hate BCH because most of them follow headlines and do not look at fundamentals. But the market loves BCH. The deeper analysts look into cryptos the more they realise BCH is the only one that can deliver what it promises. ",1524094823

"To be fair it's far better than what I was expecting. But yeah, I know that my opinion isn't unique. I was more taking about the perspective of their Dear Leader, who touted it as being groundbreaking (I forget what his exact wording was). I don't understand why a checkout option / marketing campaign was something that he deemed worth the money/hype. I get the verge community being rock-hard over the news, I imagine a good number of them were braced for another delay or just silence. So the fact that that didn't happen this time was groundbreaking for verge.. I just don't get it, it would have been great without the hype and crowd funding. Otherwise it seems like a massive waste of money that will, in my personal opinion, go nowhere. 

I don't mean to bash verge, my opinion is just that. I honestly hope that verge hits 10 dollars tomorrow and everyone invested get rich, I don't win if they lose. My original point was more general, but verge was a good example of what I meant. Trying to cut straight to individual adoption seems unrealistic atm, developing tech that businesses are able to adopt seems to be more cryptos speed right now. I'm all for baby steps, but if I were developing a crypto (and knew stuff) I'd be more interested with enterprise adoption than payment methods. That latter just seems like such an uphill battle.",1524093543
I see it the other way as a huge percentage of people borrowed money to *buy* bitcoin over the past year.

"Well if people would actually use cryptos for transactions it would scale much better than BTC right now and it follows the original idea of Satoshi Nakamoto since the original scaling solution was to increase the block size until a better proven to work reliably solution comes around. In a way it is more ""Bitcoin"" than Bitcoin.

Besides that... it's not that useful right now like almost every other crypto. You could replace almost every crypto with Ethereum + Nano and it would work just as well (maybe add Monero too).

Either way there are much worse cryptos out there which get a lot of hype (Ripple, Tron, Verge, EOS, ...) so if you make this argument for BCH you have to make it for 99% of all cryptos out there.",1524093304

The ones that are currencies attempt to take Bitcoin's protocol (and perceived flaws) and build on them, however, Bitcoin has been designed from day one to be the most efficient (and yet simply elegant) solution to multiple massive problems, that includes the inclusionary elements of low fees and global scaling.

My problem was not a technical problem. I dropped out earlier. I had nobody around me, a real person, that could have introduced me to BTC and give answers to my questions. At this time I had no reddit account and so on. 

What you all can do is to help people around you  to install a wallet (Samourai or Eclaire works as  regular wallet as well) and send them BTC for 5 USD. What will happen?

"To the best of my knowledge:

* If you have your coins in a wallet, and there has since been a mandatory wallet update, you won't lose your coins. You just won't be able to access them until you update.
* If an exchange delists a coin, I think you can still withdraw, you just can't trade it anymore? If you're walking away from your crypto for a while you shouldn't be leaving your coins on an exchange anyway.
* Not sure about effectively losing coins on exchanges that havent updated their wallet (and don't plan to). But again, just don't leave coins on exchanges long term.

Biggest concern off the top of my head is missing a token swap, e.g. swapping erc20 tokens for native tokens once the mainnet for a given token launches. I've seen at least some where they announce a time window for you to do this (like a couple months), after which any of the remaining erc20 tokens that weren't swap become worthless.

I understand that some people believe (or know) that Bitcoin Cash will fail to be a major player unless it is called ""Bitcoin"", and they are correct. It will likely never overtake Bitcoin, for so many reasons. I have been involved with Bitcoin since 2009, I know the history, the fights, the drama.

"Exactly. This is part of the reason I don't understand why the xvg thing is so amazing. Visibility and increased awareness is great, don't get me wrong, but the current state of crypto is far to convoluted to be utilized as an actual currency. Until the process is simplified (I don't have a solution for this), using crypto as actual currency is going to be done by a small subset of people. Every small step towards that is great, I'm not hating on verge at all, but it my opinion the way that crypto will thrive in the interim is by getting businesses to start utilizing blockchain on a large scale and slowly work towards smaller scale until the process is streamlined/simplified enough that crypto can be used by individuals day-to-day without effort. Attempting to jump straight to that is going to be very difficult right now.

"""because New York is hostile to crypto, and this ‚Äúquestionnaire‚Äù we received today proves that New York is not only hostile to crypto, it is hostile to business.‚Äù

Absolutely agree with this statement. They want to become the ""crypto wall street"" but are tone deaf in so many capacities. It's been a struggle living in NYC and being banned from using certain high liquidity exchanges over the past several years.

you fool it is not going to catch up to anyone the government have bigger problems than tax-dodging crypto traders,1524088103
Always happy to see more Canadians adopting crypto :) I don't vape much but I'll check out what you've got!,1524088079
"&gt; Do you have a source for 1gb blocks being able to be validated with high end computers. What about the $400,000 estimate for a full node in my doc?

&gt; Furthermore, does this mean that this computer would need to store an additional 1GB every 10 minutes or around 1 additional Terabyte per week?

This is for **Terabyte** blocks, NOT Gigabyte:

&gt;In December 2017 256 nodes used 32TB of RAM, to the tune of $3,900,000 spent on hardware and energy consumption. 

&gt;Then, in March 2018, just 32 nodes used 4TB of RAM, to the tune of just $500,000 spent on hardware and energy consumption.

I tried to link an article to the last comment, but it was rejected, so here's his own blog for the December 2017  numbers:

http://blog.vermorel.com/journal/2017/12/17/terabyte-blocks-for-bitcoin-cash.html

And the video from the conference:

https://youtu.be/PKFkhWWiLDk

&gt;&gt; It's a moot point though because over 90% of mining is already done by the ""wealthiest individuals""
&gt; 
&gt; Which doesn't make it better. There are solutions that are more decentralized. Keeping it as is right now doesn't have a future for a decentralized currency.

It's still Distributed, which is what Bitcoin's goal was in the first place. ""Decentralization"" is a buzzword coined by people like Blockstream/Core trying to start a fight where one needn't exist. The whitepaper mentions it being ""distributed,"" nowhere does it say ""decentralized."" In order for something to be decentralized, it must first be centralized. Bitcoin had always been a distributed peer to peer electronic cash system, until the banking interests funded Blockstream/Core. No one mining pool, let alone miner, controls the network, therefore it is distributed.

&gt;&gt; IOTA and Nano's potentials are too high, and their risk factors are too low.
&gt; 
&gt; Why is that. If they deliver (not even overdeliver) what they promise, they are vastly superior to all other currencies. If IOTA had a risk factor of 4, it would already be in the copy cat/questionable or 5 near scam range.

IOTA and Nano have been operating as scams in my (and many other people's) view. IOTA still has major bugs despite being out for over a year. Nano went through a name change (Deceptive behavior) in an attempt to look like a new coin to pump it up. 

Also, despite them being out for so long, 70% of IOTA trading is on two exchanges, and 80% of Nano trading is on one exchange.

These are all very large risk factors.

&gt;&gt; Your Market Cap numbers seem to be from months ago, along with your Launch dates.
&gt; 
&gt; They're from last week.

[They're completely different from CMC.](https://coinmarketcap.com/all/views/all/)

The launch dates are... off in other ways, even if you say BCH started at the fork, that's 8.5 months, not 6. 

And Bitcoin was started, well, you can see the first block here: 

https://btc.com/00000000839a8e6886ab5951d76f411475428afc90947ee320161bbf18eb6048


and/or Bitcoin Cash's fist block here: 

https://bch.btc.com/00000000839a8e6886ab5951d76f411475428afc90947ee320161bbf18eb6048",1524088054
Can you imagine it in 10 years from now? What a joke. Forks will end up destroying crypto,1524088004
"&gt;Even TB blocks are doable today according to him.

Let's stop talking nonsense, please. 1yr of TB blocks is 50PB of data to download and validate. Not to mention that every single block needs to be transmitted in a ""short time"" compared to the block time, i.e. in a lot less than 10min.

&gt;This is for on-chain transactions, which if you think every transaction will be on-chain, you're crazy. over 50% of day-to-day purchases made in the US or on credit. Bitcoin is not a credit system. Credit systems will use a layer 2, no doubt about that.


Oh, no... I'm sorry... you don't get L2 scaling. For as long as I can remember this sub has always been shouting about ""Satoshi's vision!!!"" and so on. No L2 scaling for you. Maybe you, personally, are happy with L2, but on-chain scaling is what BCH is all about. It's been said and repeated so many times it sickening. Not to mention all the shit you've been (again collectively) slinging at LN. If you really wanna do some L2 scaling, start promoting and helping LN instead of shitting on it all the time. After all, once you fix malleability, you could use it as well. Instead, fucking luminaries like Rick Falkvinge spend hours shooting videos about how shit it is. And this community seems to go in a collective delirium state worshipping the idiot like there's no tomorrow.

BCH scaling is on-chain scaling, end of story. That's why you split, not for other reasons. And again, maybe you personally have a different idea, but I don't care... you represent the community in this conversation.

&gt;So 7,000 tx PP PD for a 1 GB block, is about 605 Million tx per day. That's 1 transaction per person every ten days for the whole world, not bad. The average bitcoin user probably makes less than 1 tx per month, so currently 1 GB blocks would be able to serve the whole world three times over.

This is not global adoption... picking and choosing how many txs people will make to fit your narrative.

.Your other points are irrelevant, because you're just as likely to be Sybil attacked spinning up a full node from scratch.

You are diverting to distract from the conversation. We were talking about syncing up from scratch, and you suggested getting the UTXO set from others. And I attacked your approach. I also note you didn't reply, so I'll just assume you don't have a counter measure.  

And your follow up questions, which I'll answer, are ""Whataboutisms"". Perfect tactic to distract from the conversation by pointing at something else.

&gt;How do you know you've received the latest block?

I validate.

&gt;How do you know you're on the chain you want to be on? 

I validate.

&gt;If your node is working off an invalid UTXO set making invalid transactions, they won't be put into blocks. If you're a miner making invalid blocks, they won't be accepted. This is all Bitcoin 101 type stuff here.

Yes, and you don't seem to understand it. My node won't be working off an invalid UTXO set, because I validated everything. Again, the point was YOU were relying on others to give you the correct UTXO set without validating it, and I Sybil attacked you.

&gt;If you actually are attacked, like I said you would still be able to download the full transaction chain from an archival node.

**No. You. Would. Not. Because. Blockchain. Growth. Outpaces. Tech. Improvements.**

(Btw, I note that ultimately, you are turning to the **only** way of ensuring the UTXO set is valid... full validation. Which with your huge blocks you won't be able to do, as I argued previously. You still didn't counter that argument. You can't... numbers don't lie.)

&gt;SPV

Don't care about SPVs, not part of the conversation. We're discussing syncing up a full node, from scratch. Don't divert the conversation. 


&amp;nbsp;

All in all, you are not addressing the problem. You are trying to get out of it with mental gymnastics and conversation distractions (SPVs, Sybil attacks on my node, trying to scale off-chain when the mantra is ""on-chain scaling"".). The problem won't go away, we're bound by physical limits.

I love tech improvements like any other guy, even if you don't believe it. And, shockingly perhaps, I know full well blocks will need to increase in size, eventually. (But not before various optimizations are put in place, like Schnorr.) Of one thing I'm absolutely convinced though, and not because of blind ideological faith, but by thorough analysis of facts - On chain scaling doesn't work. As in, pure on-chain scaling only, that just doesn't work.

Bigger blocks + LN + Sidechains + Drivechains? Absolutely yes. And that's exactly how it's gonna go for Bitcoin, after this community decided to split away.

"Over complicated 2 layer. Offchain. RBF &amp; LN combined. Over High jacking by blocking the stream. LN has and will not scale BTC. Its only solution is to generate money for hired watch towers and the middle men who facilities the transactions. Plus LN would scale better on Bitcoin (BCH).

Americans had no idea, than seen 2 bitcoins which their family members who told them to buy it, during thanksgiving, was unable to describe why there was 2 Bitcoins listed on a trusted exchange. Confusion needs to cut back. It needs to be simple not more confusing. Bcash just adds blocks and gives power to miners while Bitcoinis innovating on second layer solutions to scalability. Educated people see that but not the new user which bitcoin needs if it‚Äôs going to grow. Always ask, ‚Äú how will the next generation use this technology‚Äù and you‚Äôll be good. The market can‚Äôt take more confusion which is why we applaud coinbase for not listing BGold. That would chase out all new users from the richest market.

"&gt; We're debating brand identity of ""Bitcoin"", I don't think there is an objective perspective to be ""flatly"" wrong about anything.

No, that's nonsense.

If we were debating brand identity of Oreo cookies, because the Oreo company had been taken over by Raytheon and now Oreos were cruise missiles, that would be more like what actually happened to Bitcoin. It was changed from a decentralised peer to peer electronic cash system into a retarded crippled science project for a very unlikely to work second layer project that also just so happens to provide the necessary technical architecture for a re imposition of Bretton Woods, in the event that it does actually work.

What things are actually matters, critically, their actual technical parameters and specifications. Branding, marketing, all of that nonsense, is nothing more or less than a distraction which idiots tend to fixate on as an easier to understand indicator of those technical parameters and specifications, the details of which are beyond their ability to understand.

&gt; Is there an objective definition of Bitcoin you could point to that objectively fits only BCH and not BTC?

How about the title of the Bitcoin white paper?

&gt; n my opinion, it's wildly hubristic to to come to the conclusion that fully 100% of people who support BTC today are either mentally frail or attempting to pull one over on some larger group of people.

And yet, that just means you're wrong, and you don't understand the nature of the argument. I realise in context that this makes me come across stubborn and close minded from the perspective of someone who insists that it must be more complex than I am pointing out, but it is a simple indisputable fact.

It would be like if we tried to ""engage in a sane and reasonable balanced argument"" about the takeover of Oreo by Raytheon and gave actual equal shrift to the idea that all along Oreos were supposed to be cruise missiles. Now, you could emotionally make it work with a suitable propaganda campaign and the necessary censorship of the facts, and you could probably convince a whole bunch of retarded people that it made some kind of sense to treat it that way if they had no idea of the history of the question and were not in a position to understand the difference between cookies and cruise missiles. But that once again doesn't change the facts on the ground.

&gt; I'd suggest you consider whether it's possible that you're missing something of legitimate value that at least some of the people holding and not selling the billions of $ of BTC out there see in it, but I'm guessing I'm not changing your mind about this one.

I've spent almost the past decade of my life immersed in this stuff, I've examined it from every possible angle; the only reason I hold any Bcore at all is if the central banks of the world actually manage to successfully sabotage the real Bitcoin and impose a Bretton woods style system using the bcore / lightning architecture to do so. That's it, that's the extent of any doubts I have as to their agenda and plan and what they're actually doing. There is simply no space at all for the position that Bcore matches the original vision for Bitcoin any more than a Raytheon takeover of Oreo would mean the Oreo vision was always about smart missiles.

Can I just highlight this so that it has its own little ""block"" on this page?

In fact, they could have raised the block size a harmless amount while Bitcoin Cash was under way, and killed its momentum literally overnight.   In fact, they could probably have a massive damaging effect on ""Bitcoins Biggest Adversary"" right now if they simply raised the block size limit.

So you must be asking yourself:  Why wont they do that?

Because if they raise the block size limit, then nobody needs Lightning Network, and Blockstreams investors lose money.   Im sorry, but this is literally what it comes down to.  There is no other explanation for the absurd refusal to raise the limit a safe amount.  ""Slippery slope"" was their excuse for years.   Not valid.",1524085912

&gt; what are their motivations financially.

Well according to his twitter CSW is a big fan of capitalism, so if this reflects back on nChain then their motivation is to make money. Think of the best way for them to make money and then you have a good understanding on what they might do in the future.

As I stated earlier, I don't see how hurting BCH and supporting BTC in secret would be a better plan than to just further BCH's adoption and make it more useful as cash and therefore make money in return. Assuming they hold equal amounts of BCH and BTC which in turn is very likely since they've been around for long enough to have accumulated a lot of BTC before the fork and it would be financially risky to throw all of them out right after the fork.

That's my opinion on the matter and I might very well be wrong, but as long as there's a plausible scenario that might suggest otherwise I'll go with that.

"&gt;they're victims of propaganda and are flatly wrong

We're debating brand identity of ""Bitcoin"", I don't think there is an objective perspective to be ""flatly"" wrong about anything.

I think the root of the divide in the communities isn't intellect or moral compass, but rather what properties they most value about what Bitcoin was laid out to be. 

I'd suggest you consider whether it's possible that you're missing something of legitimate value that at least *some* of the people holding and not selling the billions of $ of BTC out there see in it, but I'm guessing I'm not changing your mind about this one.

Don't underestimate then; they and people on their side still have a lot of influence and power; there is still the possibility they'll draw in the masses and make a spectable of the crash of ""Bitcoin"" in a scorched-earth strategy; or they might even manage to just keep things barelly functional and gradually deteriorate and warp their bitcoin while keeping it as the crypto entry point and public face for the masses in a slow-boiling-frog attack.

Short of something massive like a coup, or how central banks got into power in the first place, in the long term they can't win; but they can certainly keep pushing the battle further for a lot longer than most here would be willing to wait, and they might even go as far as destroying the current generation of crypto leaving us just with the hope some future generation will discover the idea and start over.",1524085528

I would never normally do something like this (call you a faggot and call you out), but you're now venturing into serious asshole territory, calling people faggots and claiming things that aren't true. Calling people names when you literally claim you are starving because you spent all your money on crypto.

Your claim for the Dow wasnt that you called the top, you claimed it was going to crash to 14k from 24k. That didn't happen. 

You also didn't call the $5900 bounce at all. You called the 19k top of BTC, but so did tons of people. Not hard to predict a drop after a parabolic rise. Also, that prediction came back to bite you in the ass when you sold your MOD and alts because of your prediction and lost out on 33k profits (current portfolio value you claim is roughly 12k) because you totally missed the alt run.

So those predictions didn't work out too well for you, and your Dow claim is straight horseshit. Don't call out ""retail investors"" and ""moon lambo boys"", when you have a portfolio of 1.5 BTC and you literally have tons of pictures of ""The lambo I will buy when MOD hits $250"", which by the way is 100x from where it is now. You say you will post a picture of that lambo every day until you are wealthy.

"Bitcoin Cash should have Dapps, invoices, and Smart Contracts listed as secondary. (memo.cash as an example of the first two)

Also for Bitcoin Cash, research is currently being done on terabyte blocks, which would be theoretically 6 Million tx/s, and it's been said that a GPU could validate 7 Million tx/s. This would be around 50 tx per person per day, (or closer to 100 per person 18+ years old) which is much more than will be necessary for decades.

Also for Bitcoin Cash, your risk profile is inaccurate, because 1 GB blocks could be done on a high-end home computer already, and getting even that high in usage would probably take over a decade. ""This would preclude all but the wealthiest individuals from participating."" participating should be changed to mining, because anybody can participate in Bitcoin Cash, you can even send transactions with a text message on a dumb phone. It's a moot point though because over 90% of mining is already done by the ""wealthiest individuals""

Also, Bitcoin Cash's ledger is just as old as Bitcoin's

I don't understand why Bitcoin's risk factor is zero, once they finally announce an upgrade to be voted on, (voted on by the miners, which they have extreme disdain for BTW) they want 50 weeks before it's actually implemented.

Ripple is much riskier than people think. 66% of all XRP is owned by the foundation, and they can sell around 1% (1 Billion) every month. Another 20% or so is locked up in pending deals with companies. Most of the companies that partner with ripple are interested in the platform, not the token.

"&gt; it is important that we do not lower our guard while they're still attacking.

That logic is kind of my point. These are now two separate projects, with separate communities, developers, and even investors, etc, and they're both using this ""We're being attacked by the other side and must defend ourselves!"" logic like two kids in the back seat of a car on a long road trip.

&gt;they fear Bitcoin Cash because it works and they can't control it

In my opinion, this is some ""The terrorists hate us for our freedom"" level logic. There are many, many, MANY people owning, contributing, using BTC, and maybe some fraction of them have the nefarious, jealous logic that you suggest, but that isn't anywhere near the majority thought process.

Core can't hurt BCH anymore. Realistically, if there ever was a window for that, its time has past. BCH will succeed or fail on it's own merits. Let's spend our energies building it up rather than ""defending"" from some external threat, which just propagates the kind of toxic environment that turns newcomers off altogether.",1524084307

"&gt; 1GB is nowhere near enough for global adoption. That's just stupid VISA level.

Visa level is 2,000 tps.

1 GB blocks are 7,000 tps

A GPU could validate 7 million tps, achieved through the fast hardware implementation of an Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) signature scheme. According to Joannes Vermorel.

http://blog.vermorel.com/journal/2017/12/17/terabyte-blocks-for-bitcoin-cash.html

Even TB blocks are doable today according to him. This would be over 50 tx per person per day, including babies and children. With just adults it's closer to 100 tx PP PD.

This is for on-chain transactions, which if you think every transaction will be on-chain, you're crazy. over 50% of day-to-day purchases made in the US or on credit. Bitcoin is not a credit system. Credit systems will use a layer 2, no doubt about that.

So 7,000 tx PP PD for a 1 GB block, is about 605 Million tx per day. That's 1 transaction per person every ten days for the whole world, not bad. The average bitcoin user probably makes less than 1 tx per month, so currently 1 GB blocks would be able to serve the whole world three times over.

Your other points are irrelevant, because you're just as likely to be Sybil attacked spinning up a full node from scratch. How do you know you've received the latest block? How do you know you're on the chain you want to be on? If your node is working off an invalid UTXO set making invalid transactions, they won't be put into blocks. If you're a miner making invalid blocks, they won't be accepted. This is all Bitcoin 101 type stuff here. If you actually are attacked, like I said you would still be able to download the full transaction chain from an archival node. 

Bitcoin only needs the chain of Block headers, and the unspent transaction outputs to work. The chain of block headers is only about 4.2 MB per year. This is why SPV wallets work even without the UTXO set. Most common phones today could download and store the full chain of block headers.

&gt;A user only needs to keep a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying network nodes until he's convinced he has the longest chain, and obtain the Merkle branch linking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in. He can't check the transaction for himself, but **by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it, and blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it.**

&gt;As such, the verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network, but is more vulnerable if the network is overpowered by an attacker. While network nodes can verify transactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network. One strategy to protect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid block, prompting the user's software to download the full block and alerted transactions to confirm the inconsistency. Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to run their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification.

http://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin/#selection-227.4-241.735

All of this can be done today. By overpower the network, it is meant miners, meaning you would need a majority of hashpower to fool the network, and this would probably be widely publicized.

Having the UTXO set and (let's say) a week's worth of blocks, would further increase the security.",1524084220
"As someone who both holds and spends, I disagree. In December, I had a certain amount. Let's say $2,700, about the price of a coin (it was not really $2,700). I could make a $2,000 transaction, then replace what I was holding. Like the majority of U.S. users, I'm at the mercy of Coinbase. Since credit cards stopped allowing crypto buys and no banks around here will allow debit transactions with Coinbase, I'm limited to a bank transfer that has a seven-day waiting period before I can move my coin. So my strategy was to hold on to a decent amount, then replace it every time I made a purchase. I can no longer do that with my original $2,700 being worth ~$900 today. I have to re-up the wallet with an additional $2,100 just to get back to my previous balance and reestablish normalcy. My only other option is to make a seven-day bet that the price won't drop too bad.

I'd imagine plenty of other crypto users around the world have the same problem with not being able to instantly purchase and spend Bitcoin. So while today's price is in effect pointless for those who can buy and spend within minutes, today's price reflective of yesterday can be a huge problem for those without that instant access.

A lot of dial up ISP's folded or sold out because the costs became very prohibitive to record all traffic for a period of 30 days (or longer now). Plus, there was a system where all emails had to go through a filtering process for NSA related flag words as well as all photos and attachments had to be saved for 30 days. There was even in the 'fine print' that said that any attachment you sent over Microsoft, Microsoft owned, and you waived your right by sending it over their system. 

I assure you either it will be outlawed, or such severe restrictions (devised by banks) that really it won't be adopted. 

It's like, what if America created a 'crypto tax' to generate missing sales tax as a result of internet loss of sales tax? This new 'Crypto tax' would be levied by all regulated exchange companies.

"&gt; Again, where we're going we don't need companies running things, just computers and the software that runs on them.

Seriously?  How naive are you?

&gt;Bitpay doesn't really help Bitcoin as a protocol at all, since they are basically an unnecessary intermediary to what should be something that Bitcoin does by simply settling the transaction by itself.

That requires people to stay in the BTC ecosysem and not cash out to fiar.  We're not there yet.

&gt;In the future, there won't need to be any intermediaries, for anything. Bitcoin is already decentralized, so any centralized thing built around it won't be needed as the protocol matures.

Ha.  Have you looked at Lightning?  It's going to require Lightning Hubs (banks) in order to have any meaningful coin flow with low fees.

You do know the first DAO was a complete and utter failure.

&gt;And it's going to be the ultimate irony when ~~bcash~~ Bitcoin Cash has no choice but to implement Segwit to not be terribly outdated compared to other coins that use it.

Because an old client that reads a Segwit block can't see signature data and is unable to verify the block, which makes it a soft fork in name only.",1524083298

I don't, when Bitcoin does, nChain should sue the offending CEO. 

Moreover, you have approximately 6 years get a patent from the application date. I'm confident the important tech in Bitcoin was not invented in the last 6 years so it is public domain, will consider being wrong with evidence. 

Depending on the jurisdiction patents are valid from the priority date and made public after 18 months of filing so unlikely to see a submarine patent from nChain. 

It is practically impossible to get a worldwide patent, one enforceable in every jurisdiction, so there will always be a jurisdiction where the IP is public domain. 

Also, it's literally imposable to get a patent enforcement of public use of a said patent with a patent priority date that is later than said patent's priority date.

"&gt; Changes to the base layer would be welcome, if they were meant to help it in the first place, not to help the business models of companies that leech of it.

You do know there has been a plan in place to grow the block size beyond on 1 MB as far back as when Satoshi Nakamoto was still coding.  An active attempt to kill a block size increase only happened after Blockstream got involved.  The core developers were always in favor of a block increase.  There is sample evidence for this all over the Internet.  And if Segwit ""techincally increases the block size,"" what difference did it make if the core block was changed or if Segwit was added.  

&gt;It's entirely optional. The cool thing about the LN, is that it doesn't try to fuck with the base layer to grow the network.

Sometimes you have to fuck with the base layer to progress.  The only thing that Core has done has been to add Segwit, which is not really a soft fork, and to add RBF, which killed 0-conf transactions.  They least they could have done is Segwit 2X and relive SOME of the congestion, instead of the perpetual 18 month wait for Lightning to get here (yeah, it's here, but only ""testers and people willing to lose their coin"" are supposed to be using it)

"So going through a few of your additional points and I've noticed that I actually did address some of them in my podcast.  I'll go ahead and answer a few here.

&gt; ‚Ä¢ The available software (lnd) is not a ""beta version"" but a ""toy implementation...

Lightning actually has worked for me for regular payments and has been fun to experiment with.  Due to the lack of current adoption, I can't do much with it as far as service options, but I don't see how that means the protocol itself doesn't work for payments, when it has worked in practice for me.

&gt; ‚Ä¢ your next 3 points are all variations of watchtowers and having to be online.

As I stated in my podcast episode, the fact that you have to be online is absolutely true.  I didn't even contradict this.  I also noted that to receive credit card payments, you also have to be online, which hasn't prevented their use. 
For the watchtowers, you say you have to ""trust"" them to stay online and watch for you.  By the same measure you have to ""trust"" network nodes to propagate your payment even though they have no financial incentive to do so.  Your transaction may never reach a miner if nodes didn't do this.  You seem to think there will be some enormous fee for what seems a simple, low cost job.  The equilibrium price for such a service would undoubtedly be extremely tiny, as the cost is almost negligible and there is practically no market barrier to entry.  
The watchtower doesn't need any personal or identifying information, and doesn't even need your transactional data to do this job, and it is *only needed* if there is ever a dispute.  I don't see how we would consider that an enormous degree of trust.

&gt; ‚Ä¢ The LN will not be usable until most bitcoin users have adopted it. If only half bitcoin users are on the LN, it may actually increase the on-chain traffic, instead of relieving it.

This would mean that the users taking advantage of it were spending additional funds rather than less in order to do so.  Use of the network would by definition mean the burden was less, otherwise people won't voluntarily spend extra money to do the same job.  This is a really silly hypothetical.

&gt; ‚Ä¢ In the current implementation, most channels will be funded only by the party that opened the channel. Then most users would not be able to receive more than what they have already spent through the LN.

I did address this point.  You can use a tool like Bosworth's HTLC payments to create liquidity in your own channels.  Its point #5 in the podcast/article.

&gt; ‚Ä¢ Even with channels funded in both directions, nodes would have to be balanced on a scale of months. Alice cannot receive a salary of $5000 through the LN, evey month, if she spends only $2000 every month.

Why would she be forced to receive her salary over LN? And if she so chose, she could have the $5000 salary received as the opening of a lightning channel with her employer, use an HTLC payment to send whatever she wants to savings (giving her liquidity), spending the rest, and having the entire channel open for her next paycheck.  I don't see how this is an issue.

&gt; ‚Ä¢ If Walmart is forbidden to do business with ISIS, they are forbidden to accept, send, or intermediate multi-hop payments that touch ISIS nodes. Thus users who want to be KYC/AML compliant will have to only deal with LN users whose identites they know, or with mediators who can be trusted to be KYC/AML compliants themselves.

Trying to control who can or cannot connect to a widespread lightning network seems like an extremely difficult job.  And trying to segregate your little corner of the network with only ""whitelisted"" participants is more likely to just make lightning payments to your store very unreliable, as opposed to spending at competitors who don't care.  Such a tactic would likely hinder themselves better than it would limit/control others.

&gt; ‚Ä¢ I hate bankERs as much as you do, but you don't understand at all what banks do, why they are needed, and why they would continue to exist (and create ""doubly virtual"" money) even if the economy switched 100% to bitcoin.

As I said, bankers will always have the ability to do this with software.  But they won't be able to do with with lightning or bitcoin, arbitrarily creating coins isn't compatible with either protocol.

your third from the bottom point considers the privacy of not knowing whats going on (privacy) is bad, then your very next point says you might be able to destroy the privacy in some hypothetical spook scenario (privacy good)... which is bad.  Is privacy good or bad? 

Also, in my podcast, I didn't make any claim that Lightning had perfect privacy, I stated multiple times actually that is was merely *better* than bitcoin payments at the core layer.  #14 is very short.

&gt; ‚Ä¢ You did not even mention the problem of finding a route in the network, without knowing who is online and how much balance remains in each channel. There is still no solution that would scale to 100 million users better than raw bitcoin.

I did address that finding a route was done by the node sending the transaction rather than controlled by other in the network, which is part of what actually makes the protocol censorship resistant believe it or not.  To claim dealing with every single transaction, the entire history to the genesis block, and broadcasting everything to all nodes on the base layer is somehow an *easier* task than just tackling the routing data and node states for a large network is kind of obviously wrong.  Raw Bitcoin has vastly larger data/resource costs than a Lightning node.  

I find it ironic that you posted on r/btc as if this ""debunked"" my podcast, when none of these were the points I answered, except of course the watchtowers and always online elements.  One I still think you are wrong about, and the other I didn't even disagree with.  If you even played the podcast episode, I'm not sure you actually *listened* to it.  

Either way, is it really ""debunking"" something if you aren't even talking about the arguments they made? ",1524081051
"Yes, I think we have the Dark Web pretty much locked up, and they are not going back to fiat through Western Union, when they can just vanish with a anon crypto, but to break through to real adoption, as an actual currency, its kinda time for some real endorsements that we can actually use to explain crypto to granny, and porn isn't The One...",1524081046

"It is very important to understand decentralization WILL NOT be able to combat the ISP's if net neutrality is abolished.

Yes you can essentially hide your browsing through decentralization and prevent ISP's from slowing down your connection based on the priority of the sites you visit. But there is no reason at all ISP's would need to function that way - it is very easy for them to combat this.

Instead of slowing down some sites and speeding up others, they can just slow down ALL connectivity and increase speed/priority to their fast lane sites. So if decentralization hides your browsing you would still be receiving slower speeds.

Net neutrality is a big issue. I don't think many people realize just how much power the ISP's already have - they have congress in their pocket and have their monopolies bought and paid for to prevent any competition from entering a given market. Without building an entirely independent infrastructure no third party could combat them, and decentralization still relies on the inherent connection from the ISP's and is therefore subject to their manipulation.

All crypto projects claiming to be the answer to net neutrality are either just trying to build hype, or don't really understand the market they are trying to enter.",1524080864

"&gt;  bashing bitcoin

Well, you are right to notice that Bitcoin Core is getting bashed by A LOT of BItcoin users.  And who can blame them?  

&gt; the great things Bitcoin Cash is doing

You are right that great stuff is being built specifically for Bitcoin Cash!  Here are just some examples: [Cointext](https://cointext.io), [Memo](https://memo.cash), [Yours](https://yours.org), [Mini-POS](https://www.minipos.cash/). [LocalBitcoinCash](https://localbitcoincash.org), [SatoshiDice](https://satoshidice.com), [Cryptonize.it](https://cryptonize.it), [Tippr](https://www.reddit.com/r/tippr/wiki/reddit-usage) / [Chaintip](https://www.reddit.com/r/chaintip/wiki/reddit-usage) / [Fairlay](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/77a0kz/fairlay_is_launching_the_reddit_twitter_tipping/).  There are hundreds more of these - just too many to mention in one post.  I wouldn't know about all these things if they weren't talked about here all the time.

Well, unfortunately, it seems that Bitcoin Core is very upset with us for having all this cool stuff and our awesomely creative community, which I guess they don't have.  And they're behaving like real jerks about it.  We're not the only ones noticing.  [Here](https://bitcointalk.to/index.php?topic=181168.msg1977971#msg1977971) is Andreas Antonopoulous himself talking about the shitty behavior of people at Bitcoin Core.  Now, it takes a *lot* to set Andreas off.   He is a very level headed guy. 

And Bitcoin Core has just gotten worse since then.  Since r\bitcoin is so heavily censored now, and their users aren't hearing about these things, we feel it's our responsibility in this uncensored BTC audit sub to point out all their shitty behavior.  In between talking about how great Bitcoin Cash is, of course.

So that's the reason.  I will say this.  If Bitcoin Core stopped the shitty behavior that Andreas mentioned, *and* if Bitcoin Core stopped trying to pull a nasty bait-and-switch on their unsuspecting users (luring them with Bitcoin, then switching them over to Lightning Network), then all the users could stop talking about how shitty they are.",1524080769
Debt jubilee first!  Then bitcoin.  ,1524080767
"&gt;Exactly what do you think Lightning is?

Lightning is a protocol... It doesn't need any companies to run once it's out there. And anyone can improve it, even if you're just an individual, a group, a company. It doesn't matter.

&gt;It's a layer 2 solution built by a third party to prevent the core protocol from growing.

It's entirely optional. The cool thing about the LN, is that it doesn't try to fuck with the base layer to grow the network. Bcash guys think we have to change the base layer so that the companies that have been built around it have an easier job. (like Coinbase, pushing for bigger blocks so their shity and outdated software isn't touched at all, But wanted to instead change Bitcoin to make their lives easier. Of course, they lost this battle, and now they have Segwit support)

Changes to the base layer would be welcome, if they were meant to help it in the first place, not to help the business models of companies that leech of it.

"I agree about the fork not being a realization event.  I'm treating it like a stock spinoff, where some of my original basis gets allocated to coin A, and the rest is allocated to coin B (and not reporting capital gain/loss until I sell).  I was going to allocate the basis proportionally based on the market values of each coin at the time of the fork, but there's complications with determining those market values.  And my recordkeeping is easier if I don't need to modify the basis of the BTC I'm still holding, and just use $0 as the basis for the fork that I sold.  In that article I linked, I don't agree with everything they said, but I was glad to see some support for treating the market value of the fork as $0 at the time of the fork.

Maybe the IRS will be ok with multiple interpretations, as long as you do something reasonable, and you're consistent; similar to how for stocks they let you choose FIFO or LIFO or other ways of determining basis.  They'll eventually get tax for everything you sell, just the timing is affected (and by using $0 as the basis for the fork I sold first, the IRS gets more tax money earlier, so maybe they'll be happy with that).

Another thought experiment: what if you sold BTC after the fork but you weren't even aware that a fork had happened; you reported it on your tax return with the basis being 100% of your original cost basis; a year later you find out that you have coins on a fork, and sell them; when you report that sale on your tax return, if you give it a cost basis of more than $0, then you'd need to amend your previous tax return to use a smaller basis for the BTC?  I think using a basis of $0 for the forked coin makes sense in that case.  Maybe in some cases there's ambiguity about which side of the fork keeps the original basis, but so far I think it's been clear that if you bought some BTC before the fork, and send it to an exchange after the fork using the same software as before the fork, you can sell it at the price that corresponds to BTC (maybe if a fork like SegWit2x happened, this would get more complicated).",1524080620

"&gt; Correct. But core also contributed NOTHING to Lightning. It's not part of the protocol. It's another layer that's being developed by 3 different third party teams that doesn't even need Bitcoin.

You mean, just liked Bitcoin can be copied by anyone because it's open source? Bcash wouldn't exists if it wasn't for this. 

There is a huge difference between companies working to build open standards to further the protocol, and companies benefiting from Bitcoin but not contributing a damn thing to what Bitcoin is as a protocol.

If those ""3 companies"" would cease to exist, the protocol would carry on, and still benefit from all the work that was done.

&gt;Lightning can be slapped on any cryptocurrency.

Feature, not bug.

&gt;It doesn't even need Segwit.

Yeah it does. And it's going to be the ultimate irony when bcash has no choice but to implement Segwit to not be terribly outdated compared to other coins that use it.

&gt;What they've done is allow you to easily use Bitcoin and to buy it using fiat online. This is insanely important for adoption and use as a currency. Even Bitpay is extremely important to the ecosystem as whole. Anything that makes it easier to spend Bitcoin is a net win for the community.

Again, where we're going we don't need companies running things, just computers and the software that runs on them.

Decentralized exchanges that work with fiat will be one of the hardest things to tackle for sure... 

Bitpay doesn't really help Bitcoin as a protocol at all, since they are basically an unnecessary intermediary to what *should* be something that Bitcoin does by simply settling the transaction by itself.

In the future, there won't *need* to be any intermediaries, for anything. Bitcoin is already decentralized, so any centralized thing built around it won't be needed as the protocol matures.

In the future, we'll just be interfacing with computers (DAOs), and they won't need companies behind them. ",1524080005

"Meta: I am completely for on-chain scaling and maintaining the cash-like utility of BCH. I own BCH have a vested interest in its long term success. 

That said, a tech called [Perun](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/635.pdf) that was just release that should be taken notice of. Basically it allows for LN type functionality without a huge number of the issues LN is facing. I'll let the author describe it:

&gt;In this work, we introduce Perun, an off-chain channel system that offers a novel method for
connecting channels that is more efficient than the existing technique of ‚Äúrouting  transactions‚Äù  over  multiple channels. That is, in contrast to prominent existing solutions such as the Lightning Network,  Perun does not  require,  for  each  individual  payment, involvement  of  the intermediary  over  which  the  payment  is routed.  This  is  achieved  by introducing  a  new  technique  called ‚Äúvirtual payment channels‚Äù. 

I think that on-chain scaling will get us incredibly far, and should always be improved. I do also believe that something like this can help give this community an even greater advantage over BTC. We should not turn a completely blind eye to large advances in the off-chain space, such as this. ",1524079530

I‚Äôm assuming you think there should be laws restricting lobbyism? If so, would you see the contradiction in a world where government over regulates and yet lobbyist still exists and can bend those regulations to whatever degree they wish. Surely you do not want that. But this is what happens in every sector ever in which government regulates. The result is more monopoly and less competition, almost always. 

Finally, and most important to understand, is that there are always going to be bad actors. With or without regulation. Prior to 2015 ATNT was preventing its lower tier users from accessing face time.

Post 2017 Apple was caught throttling it‚Äôs older mode phones. 

(For cohesion sake: When regulation comes to crypto, to think that we won‚Äôt see exit scams or manipulation, is absurd. The difference is that a very few and elite group of people in and around the industry will make those regulations. Since self preservation is in our nature, they will always bend the rules in a way that is advantageous to their own.)

Yup. Makes perfect sense. Do you think EOS can potentially take the place of the etherium because they theoretically will be able to run much faster than etherium (I know etherium has projects like Casper etc.). It seems like if someone can combine scalability with speed like the promise of EOS they will be able to in part rule this world. Or do you see multiple projects like EOS and etherium providing a platform as you say? And why haven‚Äôt we moved away from bitcoin? It seems like that blockchain is min slower and you cannot scale.

It took 5 hours to implement a fix. During those 5 hours, no valid blocks were created. Whatever you call it, Bitcoin did not work during those 5 hours.

I feel now that crypto has been more ""mainstream"" there will be a lot more people interested in a big marketing ploy with a huge company like Mind Geek, even if we feel there is no practical use for this announcement.

"I totally agree with your post but it's really two posts:

1. The Crypto Market's reactions to any ""news"" is meaningless bullshit. Don't read into it.
2. Crypto UX massively sucks and no one seems to care.

Those two points are separate IMO, the market reaction has nothing to do with the shitty UX that is currently the norm for all crypto purchasing. In this case with Verge/Pornhub it's a well known name but not a meaningful partnership at deeper inspection, so it won't help Verge adoption much at all right now, plus Verge price was already overhyped and/or manipulated too high anyway, maybe some people went to buy Verge based solely on the news whilst all the manipulators/victims were selling off more realizing it was not a great deal after all.

Your suggested UX whilst clearly better is still not where it needs to be, this is what it should be everywhere:

1. User clicks on ""Buy Now""

No talk of wallets, QR codes, currency names, exchanges, logins/passwords, recovery keys, installing software. it just needs to all hide behind a single button! It should be a one click checkout that inherits all your previously configured settings but for that to happen we need OS/Device/Browsers/Apps seamless wallet integration (plus decentralized underpinnings which is a whole other issue) so when you click buy the rest is all simply taken care of. Done deal, should be just like Paypal integration UX is for those places that have integrated it well.

You should NEVER have to set-up your payment options at every site you visit; you set it up in the OS/Browser/Device one time and be done, let the user configure security however they want (fingerprint, face, password etc) so that wallet is secured on the device. Until we have native OS/Browser/Device/App integration Crypto Payments will always be too clunky for mass adoption (by sites and by consumers.) Side note; Metamask a solution is a joke right now, if people think that's a good UX they are smoking crack! Hey Google! Native Chrome Wallet please, k thx, bai!

 Look at say Apple Pay for a good example of what is possible; integrated into the device and OS, available to all Apps, great credit card processor integrations, great security architecture, unlocked by Fingerprint, quick and easy to use, millions of marketing dollars spent by the biggest tech company on the planet with hundreds of millions of iPhone users already out there and yet not mass adoption! Apple could easily plug their preferred crypto currency in there and then its game over for the opposition, no one is going to do better than that in the foreseeable future.

 So crypto has more than a long way to go for mass adoption and yes the UX is key and no one is solving that yet because its all still engineers and naive investors not experienced product managers and designers, even after that though there's the social engineering of having consumers accepting it as the norm, that could take much longer as that will take an Apple or Google (or Samsung?) or someone to truly make it seamless to the user via their intermediary delivery platform (which really means device/os integration done right.)",1524077566

"To help you understand further, think of ethereum as a platform to build other apps on. In order to build those apps you need fuel. The fuel you need is ether. Because people will continue to build new and diverse apps on the ethereum blockchain, ether will go up on value because it will always be needed to create. There isn't, as far as i'm aware (I think they may have been considering making more ethers but still having a set amount at one point), a limit to how much can be created on the blockchain. There is also a set amount of ether available to use making it hold more value. There are other coins that also provide more of a utility or intrinsic value. If you were to invest in what I like to call ""crypto-commodities,"" because they are not all currencies, I would look at ""coins/tokens"" that are like that. ",1524076958
"ETH already has the most used blockchain, not BTC.  I didn't mean ""most valuable coin"", more tx wise. I could be completely wrong though, but at this point i don't see any others with that potential, save Walton and IOTA (depending on the state of IOTA at the end of the year)",1524076948
"&gt; Irrelevant. Without checking every single txs, I could receive a BCH block and consider it valid. Upon receiving a block, every txs is checked to see if it's valid. And this includes checking stuff like the block reward is what it's supposed to be, and that no one is spending money that they don't have. Merkle trees don't give you that information.

The whole point is that you only need to check the transactions that are in the UTXO set. Any block that is older than, let's say 1 week old (i'm just throwing out an arbitrary number here.), when your chain matches the chains of all your peers, can safely be assumed to be valid if the headers all hash into each-other, because you're on the longest chain. (Longest chain = valid chain, as per Bitcoin rules.) So even before verifying any of the transactions, you know you have the correct block headers, based on the amount of work done.

Now all you need to do at that point, the minimum, is to verify that you have the correct UTXO set. This can be done multiple ways, but in simple terms, this is all you need to do.

You're saying that the only way you can do this, is to check every single transaction from the genesis block.

And I'm saying this is bullshit, because you can poll all of the miners with the correct block height, the same way you poll them to find out if you're on the correct chain. 

This can also be done multiple ways, you can just download the UTXO set from every peer you see and compare all of them (consumes a lot of resources) or nodes can hash their UTXO sets into Merkle Trees. You can then compare the Mekle Trees of your peers before deciding which peers to download from. This can also be broken down, there can be a new Tree for every 50,000 blocks (just under 1 year), for example. Once you verify said Tree is the same for a majority of your peers, you can then start downloading the individual transactions from the nodes with the same Tree. Then when you're done, you can verify if you have the correct UTXO set using bloom filters or IBLTs, for example.

If you do all of this, and still can't find a clear consensus among your peers, or you don't trust this process, then you could still download the complete transaction history for whichever Tree failed, or even the whole chain from an archival  node (like a blockchain explorer site), and prune it as you go. There simply is no need for 90+% of nodes to hold every transaction ever made since the genesis block.

&gt;and ""9+1"" =/= ""1+9"" in the sense that it refers to different ownership... so address A has 1, address B has 9 vs address A as 9, address B has 1. So you see, you CANNOT determine the validity of the UTXO set without full validation of every single txs from the genesis block. Period.

All you need to verify is that the UTXO transaction's hashes match the Merkle Roots of the blocks they belong to.

&gt;OK, I stand corrected, it's ~165GB as of today. My argument doesn't change... 2.1MB blocks would give you the same conclusion. Which is what I stated multiple times, with ~2MB blocks the blockchain grows faster than tech improves.

It doesn't matter if it **grows** faster than tech improves, if it's currently using less than 0.01% of the available tech!

""It grows faster than tech improves!"" = Red Herring

It's generally accepted that adoption will be more like an S curve. At some point adoption will reach a saturation point, and adoption growth will slow.

Right now, with current hardware, the Bitcoin network could handle a 100,000% increase in adoption and usage, over 1 MB blocks. (Or 12,500% over BCH's current 8 MB max block size, or 3000% over BCH's Mid-May 32 MB max block size, or 1,500,000% increase over BCH's current actual block size.) And you wonder why I think you're crazy for mentioning a 66% increase of usage? 

Bitcoin (BTC) could handle an **overnight** increase in usage of over 66% before it hits the block limit, based on current % of Segwit usage. This is still an overly extreme amount less than current hardware can handle.

Bitcoin (BCH) could handle an overnight increase in usage of 14,000% before it hits it's current block limit. This is still a more than sizable amount less than current hardware can handle.

&gt;I already did above and in the previous post. Current size of the blockchain, ~165GB. 2.1MB blocks add ~66% space to the blockchain. This outpaces tech improvements.

You're looking at this from the wrong angle, see above.

"Every hack has been to exchanges not the bitcoin network itself. If a bank gets robbed you don't blame USD. It is basically the same thing. As for stolen coins, it is again a human error rather than the network breaking. Much like if you don't realize that you have a $20 bill sticking out of your pocket or you email a picture to the wrong person.  
  
Now I agree that stolen coins is just a terrible thing, but how do you propose we stop it from happening? Any solution I can think of involves some kind of human committee to say ""yes these were stolen, we are going to fork the chain so they go back to their rightful owners"". But then we have just added a human point of error to the protocol, who decides who gets to be on the committee?  
Again it's terrible people have had their money stolen, but I don't know what kind of trustless way we can realistically get it back without adding humans to the equation.",1524075348

B) centralized? Multiple dev teams contributing to its development, unlike BTC whose development is controlled by a single corporation who has AXA , mastercard as investors (among others). Since Bitcoin threatens central banking and the current manipulated money we use, it is not hard to realize what has happened.

Oh, this blockstream folks also ""kicked"" Gavin Andresen of bitcoins development because he had diferent ideas (no LN bullshit, although i cant speak for him). It also censors all discusion about bitcoin and all opinions that do not agree with the centralized scaling plan that is the lightning network.

An alternative is the equivalent of property portfolios, most growth is in asia in terms of pure real estate investment, and there maybe ways to tokenize the gains of portfolios in much the same way lending companies are beginning to look at the crypto space.

"Unfortunately it is you who doesn't understand fractional banking. Let me illustrate with gold coins. You have 10 golds in your pocket. You go to a bank and deposit your 10 gold coins. You now have 10 gold coins in your account. The bank then takes 9 of those gold coins (I'll use the same reserve rate as you did) and lends them to Jack who wants to buy a motorcycle. Jack pays interest on the loan and part of the interest goes to you as interest on your deposit. Jack buys the motorcycle and thus the motorcycle company now has 9 gold coins. They deposit them to the same bank as you. Now you have 10 gold coins and the motorcycle company has 9 for a combined 19. There are only 10 gold coins in the vault. Did the bank create any new money? Depends how you look at it. 

The bank could take 8.1 of the motorcycle company's deposit and lend again and the cycle continues until there are 90 gold coins in deposit and 10 in the vault like you mentioned. The bank has no ability to print or create new money anymore than you do. It's all on paper. This same mechanic works whether with fiat, bitcoin or gold coins. With bitcoin you would send 10 bitcoins out of your wallet into theirs and your account would be credited with 10 bitcoins. Where those 10 bitcoins are in the literal sense is out of your control. The bank simply ""guarantees"" that when you want to use your 10 bitcoins they have the liquidity allow that.

What would happen if both you and the motorcycle company would want to take out your deposit? The bank would collapse and there would be a banking crisis. Before central banks this was very common occurrence.",1524073944

"Easy explanation

There are a lot of components that work together. Most software has many components that you serve specific purposes that you connect together to make something useful. Think of these components as sentences in a novel, put enough of them together in an interesting way and you might have a good story. I will try to give one-line explanation of some of the main pieces.

ACES: A project full of components that relate to blockchain interoperability services.

ACES Listeners: A piece of software that records and saves blockchain events to a database

ACES Service provider: A user or business that operates a server that is running an active ACES service.

ACES Service: A piece of software that utilizes multiple ACES Listeners to react to activity on one blockchain to submit activity on another.

ARK Deployer: A script for installing/running any components needed to start up an independent ARK blockchain

ACES Service Capacity: A service uses tokens/coins from a blockchain to represent capacity. This can be viewed as Gas or Liquidity. For example, if you are offering to move tokens from BTC to ARK, you can only move ARK if you already have ARK. If a service runs out of capacity, they can't provide any more services and must replenish their stash.

So here is how an ICO works then.

1) Use ARK Deployers to start a new chain, ARK-B. (~30-60 minutes)

2) Automatically receive new coins as your service capacity. (0 minutes)

3) Start an ACES Listener for ARK so you know when transfer requests have been made. (~30 minutes)

4) Launch an ACES service and sell your new tokens using an ARK to ARK-B service, which depletes your ARK-B capacity until all your tokens have been sold. (~30-90 minutes)

5) Optional: Register your ACES service to the ACES marketplace so people can find it (~1 minute)",1524071334

"The question seems to be headed in the direction with total disregard to BCH having real use cases as electronic currency, multiple development contributing teams and continuous innovation, but rather hints at the point that none of this matters if it is funded by [x] for [y] reasoning, whether the reasoning be true or not.

Could it be possible that CSW has a some ridiculous amount of BTC/BCH and doesn‚Äôt need investors or maybe he is using the money he made from the supposedly SN deal? 

I don‚Äôt have an answer to your question. However, I believe nobody started asking who is funding Blockstream until they started making nonsensical decisions with implementations on the protocol, upon a closer look I believe AXA which has direct ties to the existing financial monopoly was one of the contributing investors.

At this point with BCH the code is speaking for itself, if BCH becomes remotely like Blockstream, then the question will be relevant. Until then, your question is FUD.

"Let us perform another thought experiment: one in which Lightning coexists on top of a globally accepted Bitcoin that is unencumbered by restriction. The best of all worlds, so to speak.

Alice and Bob have, like most typical Bitcoin-using consumers in this thought experiment, savings of Bitcoin secured by private keys they solely control and protect. They also have more liquid Bitcoin in the form of open channels with larger liquidity providers (""financial services"") that can process large-volume commerce across Lightning. These financial services typically prefund consumer channels with *many times* the consumer's contribution so that they may be reused over time. They are capable of delivering many payments cheaply by virtue of these prefunded channels, and through the miracle of thought experimentation are able to turn a profit on this business. These channels are, effectively, an investment by the service company. They have a financial interest in honest and competitive operation. Watchtower overhead will be disregarded.

In our experiment, Alice and Bob happen to use two different financial services for Lightning. Since these services are networked easily between each other with heavily funded liquidity channels used to settle consumer transactions, in an optimal system there are typically up to three ""hops"" between a payee and a payer. We will assume the ""worst case"" scenario described. We will also assume that a lightning surcharge is magnitudes smaller than a Bitcoin fee, and that a Lightning transaction is equal byte-weight to a Bitcoin transaction that doesn't use Lightning (it would actually be larger). These are massive concessions, intentionally so.

Case A) Alice wishes to pay Bob, and Bob wishes to put the payment into his savings after receiving it.

Alice could simply send with Lightning and make Bob transfer his funds. In the optimal case, there will be 2 surcharges to process their payments with Lightning. Those charges are paid to the financial services that settle the payment across the channel. If Bob then wishes to send that money to his Bitcoin ""savings"", he'll have to close (and maybe re-open) a channel. Total Costs: Alice: 2 lightning fees, Bob: 1+ network fees.

However, Alice instead decides to send Bob some Bitcoins out of her savings directly to his. She pays a one-time fee, equal to about the amount one would pay to open or close a channel. Total Cost: Alice: 1 network fee.

Clearly, it is in Alice's interest to use Lightning since 2 lightning fees are much less than one network fee. Bob is the one paying extra for the luxury of on-chain security, so Alice has no incentive to send the money from her ""savings"" - her investment into Lightning creates her incentive to use it.

Case B) Alice wishes to pay Bob from her savings, but Bob doesn't care how the money is received.

Alice already has a Lightning channel, so she can just immediately send Bob the funds across the Lightning network, and then fund a channel with the amount out of her savings at leisure. Total Cost: Alice: 2 lightning fees and 1 network fee.

Cut out the middle-man, thinks Alice, and she instead sends a traditional Bitcoin transaction to make the payment. Total Cost: 1 network fee.

In this case, a traditional transaction is much more appealing. This reversal reveals what should be very obvious about Lightning: the only incentive to use it is the prospect of saving money on fees *when transacting with other people that use it*, or extracting money from those people looking to save on fees.

In conclusion, there is no economically rational reason to begin to use Lightning at all, and one could then surmise that the only reason people do use it is ""because it's novel"" or ""because I can make money on it by providing financial services"".

My ""science"" says, Lightning is for scam artists and their marks. So much for refuting yours, eh?",1524070977

"A lot has changed in India since Nov 2016 in cryptos. Back then, there were not many options to buy them in India and few that existed were selling at premium - as high as 20% even before Nov 2016. Also, that means few people trading were using international exchanges to do so. 

This situation was like this till sept 2017, when Indian exchanges came into existence and Indian ""market"" was created. No. of exchanges grew from 2 to 10 with 20 more in pipeline within 3 months. The ""premium"" finally eroded and the prices became almost equal to international price on normal day.

It‚Äôs amazing how the Ethereum and Litecoin and Ripple subs all tout news about those coins *without making negative comments about Bitcoin*.

&amp;nbsp;

There‚Äôs got to be some point at which BCH can get this sub‚Äôs first page to have zero stories about why Bitcoin is bad.   This is especially true since ETH,. LTC, XRP and others didn‚Äôt name their coin ‚ÄúBitcoin [word].‚Äù  This leaves BCH in the company of Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Private, Bitcoin Diamond ‚Äî when BCH is truly a much better crypto.

BTC is simply the first coin.  *Propoganda* might be best described as promoting a separate coin by using Twitter, Reddit, iOS and Google apps; and a domain name to confuse newcomers.   If Roger Ver created a smart phone in a white case called iPhone Cash, and said it was ‚Äúmore consistent with Steve Jobs‚Äô original vision,‚Äù would he become Apple?  (No, he‚Äôd be sued for trademark infringement).

Remember, outside of this sub, or outside of Reddit, the relatively few people who follow crypto at all, are not monitoring the dispute between BTC and BCH.  It‚Äôs not healthy for either coin.   I own both coins thanks to the 2017 fork and think this fighting is just toxic and mutually destructive.  Promote the positive aspects of BCH!

"Sorry but that ""anti-FUD"" podcast is quite disappointing.  For the most part it just repeats the hype that has been put out bu Ln believers since the beginning, and does not address the real problems with the idea.

I don't have time to repeat here the objections in detail (and they would probably be removed or hidden if I did).  Just a brief recap of some of them:

+ The available software (`lnd`) is not a ""beta version"" but a ""toy implementation"": a version that cannot be used for real payments, because it lacks essential features and does not scale to the target size.

+ The fact is that there are no ""watchers"" (""watchtowers"") means that users are forced to remain online most of the time, downloading and scanning the blockchain. For that reason, the current version of the `lnd` does not let mobile users create bidirectional channels, because they would be too insecure. 

+ If watchers were available, almost every user would have to notify a watcher promptly of almost every LN payment -- and pay a fee for him to keep watching, and trust that he is indeed watching.  So much for ""trustless""...

+ The fact that a node must be online to receive an LN payment is a big problem, especially for mobile users.  Note that PayPal, bank wires, and even raw bitcoin do not have this limitation.

+ The LN will not be usable until most bitcoin users have adopted it.  If only half bitcoin users are on the LN, it may actually increase the on-chain traffic, instead of relieving it.

+ Gurus have predicted fees of $50 or more for on-chain transactions.  In that case there would be an upfront, non-refundable $100 fee per channel for joining the LN, and another $50 fee for adding more funding to an existing channel.

+ In the current implementation, most channels will be funded only by the party that opened the channel.  Then most users would not be able to receive more than what they have already spent through the LN.

+ Even with channels funded in both directions, nodes would have to be balanced on a scale of months.  Alice cannot receive a salary of $5000 through the LN, evey month, if she spends only $2000 every month. 

+ If Walmart is forbidden to do business with ISIS, they are forbidden to accept, send, or intermediate multi-hop payments that touch ISIS nodes.  Thus users who want to be KYC/AML compliant will have to only deal with LN users whose identites they know, or with mediators who can be trusted to be KYC/AML compliants themselves.

+ I hate bankERs as much as you do, but you don't understand at all what banks do, why they are needed, and why they would continue to exist (and create ""doubly virtual"" money) even if the economy switched 100% to bitcoin. 

+ The current toy network was created by LN believers for testing, so it cannot be taken as representative of what the real LN would look like if it were to exist.  And anyway it has a remarkable feature: one cannot ever know how it is being used, or even if it is being used at all.

+ While LN payments are private, spooks could in theory detect them by pretending to send payments routed through the channel of interest, and noting when those attempts fail due to insufficient balance in that channel.

And, most importantly,

+ You did not even mention the problem of finding a route in the network, without knowing who is online and how much balance remains in each channel.  There is still no solution that would scale to 100 million users better than raw bitcoin.",1524069905

Im just saying the amount of people required to FOMO in will have to be huge, much bigger than in december and I dont see it happening.

"All fair points, and to be honest, I‚Äôm not sure where I actually come out in this argument. 

I guess my main claim is just that the limited supply of BTC isn‚Äôt *that* big a selling point, or differentiation from current systems we have. It‚Äôs divisibility is at least similar to problems we currently have with fiat, though I appreciate it is not as large a problem as the ability to print money unhindered. ",1524069760

"This is the same difference. Except that it is even harder for a project like this to evolve into something viable.
Third world countries need to be banked, but it won't happen over cryptocurrencies in the short to mid range. Solutions like MPesa have way to much political power as to be just chucked off the marked. And to be honest - MPesa works. It works just fine. There is a lot of trust from companies and people. This is hard to break.
If you refer to countries like Zimbabwe, having no official currency at all for a few years now. They find ways. They just accept everything (mostly Dollars and Rand). But even in a situation like this it won't be crypto to the rescue (as seeing in Venezuela, issuance of a cryptocurrency by an inherently corrupt government won't build trust and won't stop inflation). In these cases a bigger political change is the only way to fight being underbanked (or, ""undersolutioned"", if that makes any sense).
So with all your effort you're running into problems that you maybe can foresee but not control. And you're running into being maybe a viable product, but a niche solution.
I refer to Electronium which (kind of) tries the same. Their argument is that everyone can mine the currency on their smartphone (it doesn't even have to be powerful) and with the rise of cheap Chinese smartphones in Africa, this will become common place and if they have it, they will trade it. But that is just illogical. It's the same logic Sheldon from TBBT argued with when he planned for a new Israel in the Mexican desert: ""build it and they will come"". But it just doesn't work like that. ",1524069734

"You act like this hasn't happened many times already. Each time it recovers stronger than ever, and the ground floor rises.

There is a real reason for this. Not just adoption and exposure. But release of old money, and bringing in new money.

Each crash has old money taking profits (and some savvy or just sheer lucky new money who timed sells well). However after the dust settles and people buy into the floor, we have old money (some of which was waiting to just ship and seal in profits) replaced by new money who are now at their ground floor.

The last crash was from around 1200 to $500. People were saying the exact same things that they said on the previous crash from $10 to $1. Crypto is dead. The world has woken up and sees this is a scam. So you now say that today. Just like they did then. And you are just as wrong as they were. Why?

Because this ISN'T a scam, no matter how much you try to convince yourself. It hasn't died on the last 10 crashes, why would it die now?

No, instead the ground floor has risen. Typically is has risen 10x over the previous crash ground floor. This time, about 12x, $500 to $6000ish.

Guess what? Just like we will never see $500 BTC again, we will never see $6000 BTC again.

The ground floor is now full of the next wave of adopters who now have their piece of the $6000 ground floor and are holding long. There is less old money and early adopters waiting to jump ship. We are more stable today than we ever have been. 

We just needed a bloodletting.

Think about what happens next. If (For argument sake) BTC hits $1M by 2020 and then pops. You sell some at $900k (you missed the peak). It eventually settles back down to $60k. 

It's now 10x higher than the previous ground floor. You sold and you took profits, and you sent out, but only 10% in what you were... but guess what?

You have been replaced with people who are now at their $60k ground floor. BTC may go on another run. If it grows in a more stable way this time, it may not pop. 

At some point, one of the bull runs won't end in a bubble pop, but in an asymptote approach to its long term steady state adoption value, where it will move in small waves +/- 5% over a year timeframe.

That's where we are headed. That's where we came from. This thing isn't going away, no matter what some people wish (because they aren't in yet).

We are still in the early adoption phase, and there is a lot of room for growth here. ",1524068807

"&gt; Systems evolve and change. The white paper was never a constitution. 

Correct, but it is kind of constitution or charter.

&gt; BCH might be closer to ""satoshis vision"" but that doesn't make it bitcoin.

Incorrect. The whole point of the white paper is to declare and define a system, and that system was defined by Satoshi and declared to be Bitcoin.

You must identify what the name Bitcoin applies to. Is it the white paper, which is the description of the invention? Is it the first implementation of the software? Is is the protocol that forms the network? Or is it the persistent data produced by that system? Since we agree that systems evolve, largely through code, data and protocol changes, that leaves only the white paper to define Bitcoin.

As the system evolves, it can retain the name Bitcoin, and you are correct this is through consensus. Specifically, the current participants are willing to adapt and continue calling it Bitcoin. But because is evolves it is inevitable that it will wander too far from the original specification, at which point there will be a preemptive fork, like BCH.

At that moment in time they are clones, on separate networks, they are both technically Bitcoin. The only thing besides a socket address that is different is their charter. It is of my opinion the charter that is closest to the white paper carries the name Bitcoin. Both networks are free to compete for the for the title, because both will be subject to natural market forces. Either could die on the vine and the survivor garners the title.

In our present situation, I think the market likes both, and both will survive with different roles, and both will carry the name Bitcoin. To borrow a tree analogy, there will be many grafts. I also expect BCH to eventually wander too far from the ""constitution"" and we will get another graft. It may even become standard operating procedure to deliberately launch a Bitcoin graft of the current implementation before exploring the next hard fork in protocol or persistence.",1524068323

TL:DR ZEN is a privacy protocol that can work like Monero with additional functionality

&gt;ZEN / ZEN cash has the option to send payment completely anonymous \(like monero\) or not \(like Bitcoin/ETH/ARK or any other non privacy coin\). I believe this is a strength as it gives the user options and possibly avoids scrutiny fromm governments. Another cool thing about ZEN is they are implementing IP Address obfruscation which basically allows people in countries that have authoritative governments, like China, get around using VPN's / get around the great firewall. The fact that ARK is going to be using ZEN's protocol here is huge. ARK would be able to 'change into any other crypto' via encoded listeners/smartbridge, anonymously with ZEN.  
&gt;  
&gt;I am not exactly sure how the smartbridge will work with this and I dont think it is yet completed/tested however as a long time holder of ZEN \(and ARK\) I can say both teams are excellent and highly motivated to make this work.

r/btc is a place to discuss all things bitcoin, including it‚Äôs forks, but BCH is widely supported here because it‚Äôs considered to be what bitcoin was meant to be and most early supporters of bitcoin do not like the changes (the tech, store of value, hold to the moon for lambos) happening to Bitcoin.

I'm not a techincal person, I don't know if it can (some reputable people are claiming that it can not mathematically), but the way I look at it is that lots of highly skilled people are working on it and I wish them all the success. 

How is that relevant though? Even if it does not succeed, BTC will not increase the blocksize, at least to the levels of demand. When BCH hardforked, it wasn't just the code that was hardforked, the community did as well. Now their side is the small blocker, NOTX side, the people who wanted a blocksize increase are completely gone.

"&gt;I've done my share of public speaking, you definatley do get flow going and a rehearsed narrative.

You are trying to spin passion as rehearsed narrative, they are not the same thing. Roger has always been passionate about bitcoin, that's where the flow comes from. 

If it comes as a ""rehearsed"" narrative to you it is so because, in the end, Bitcoin is simple and it's value proposition is simple, digital peer-2-peer cash. Unfortunately though we live in an era when people are so used to banks and being financially controlled that digital peer-2-peer cash makes no sense to most the first time they hear it. That remains the value proposition of bitcoin nonetheless, and anyone trying to deflect the discussion from financial freedom to anything else, such as financial gold, is a bitcoin idiot who misses the entire point. Bitcoin's potential will be untapped only when people listen and fully understand what peer-to-peer digital cash means, and if that takes time to happen it doesn't mean we should describe bitcoin as something else in the meantime.

You probably do not understand the meaning of ""peer-to-peer digital cash"" or ""financial freedom"" (your mind responds in cycles, ""but I'm free already""). The day when you realise what that means any speech by Roger will be music for your ears. Until then, it will just be boring and ""repetitive"".

Now i's no loner a scam? But instead they wasted money on investment.

"I'm convinced that the main reason Roger and his disciples have been attacking this subreddit since at least 2016 is because Roger knows he will never be able to own /r/Bitcoin for himself. 


Roger owns the bitcoin.com domain, which he uses to run his own cloud mining operation, store, forum, news outlet, casino, and more. He has fully monetized the /r/btc subreddit as well, and even has the @Bitcoin twitter account farting out his idiotic Bcash scam.

"I‚Äôm not an expert, but .. For example, a loan of 100 BTC with let‚Äôs say a low interest of 2%.

Over time 100 BTC becomes more and more valuable. Mean while, your employer needs pay you less and less BTC because the value of your work is not increasing at the same rate. Your loan is now increasingly harder and harder to pay off, even though it was a very low interest rate.

There is very little incentive to make this loan in the first place, because it has a smaller return over a greater amount of time. 

In this scenario, because loaning is not incentives, and instead, hoarding money is, because it is a greater and less risky return on investment. When people hoard money the economy slows down which leads to recessions and depressions. ",1524065360

Efficient usage of blocks matters. You shouldn't only rely on block increase. Yes.

If bitcoin cash with not embrace ""other stuff"" (not ln though) it will fail too eventually, but at least nobody is pretending that paying for simple transaction ¬£54 fee is sustainable, or even worse, success.

Raising block was necessity long time ago, but your precious dev team that I supported in the past too, care more about their own goals than about btc itself.

By they own goal I mean empowering relay nodes as a must to run ""safe"" network, but really it is a goal to create second layer solution on top of those nodes that block stream admitted with benefit financially in few points.  

Even rbf when introduced was supposed to help to calculate fee needed to pay to be successful, but now I see it was to create race to the top in fees. Very very crafty and murky.

Core team I personally are the last people I will trust now. Not because what they say their justification is, but because of what they actually did to my once beloved btc.

"Biggest problem by far is the fact that around 60M XVG was created by the hacker if not more, its the difference between stealing money which will always be a problem whether its with fiat money or with crypto where people might not store their private key correctly. But the hack was really just counterfeiting money which for a correctly made crypto should be impossible. Even more worrying is that Verge has just 1 developer who appears incompetent.
First of all 2 other coins Myriad and DigiByte had the same problem and fixed it. A massive oversight as he could have prevented the entire hack by rewriting a bit of code using the fix from DigiByte. When the hack happened like said in the other comment he simply copy pasted code without rewriting it, he then said it was fixed which it was not. He then pushed a fix without knowing it was a hardfork. Verge only got a boost from McAfee's tweet in December which also has a strong chance of being paid promotion. Most people here don't care if a coin fails but seeing some coins with such a high market cap while they are either a ponzi scheme like Bitconnect or have a lot of red flags like Verge or Tron is damaging the entire crypto space IMO.

"&gt;But why is centralization in LN less important than in mining (if that is what you are saying)?

Because in mining it can cause catastrophic problems for the entire network.

With lightning centralisation allows a party to be a minor nuisance only to those who open channels with them, which you don't have to do. You can't choose who mines your bitcoin transactions and you can't stop someone with &gt;50% of the hashrate attacking the blockchain and wreaking havoc. In lightning you can just choose not to open channels to nodes that misbehave. And those misbehaving nodes can't do anything like as bad. Worst case scenario a channel partner goes dark, but has a watchtower, so you have to wait for the locktime of the channel to end. That's a minor inconvenience, but individual channels are limited in how much bitcoin they can contain, and that affects only a handful of  parties at a time. You could always implement a limit that says a node can only have 10 channels max. Or just choose to never open a channel of your own with a partner that has more channels than you deem to be acceptable. ",1524064276
"Tons of people said it was a scam. They've been doing it for over a year now since I first jumped into crypto and started by buying XVG.

At this point I've come to the conclusion that most people in crypto are about as intelligent as a box of nails and are only here with the hope that their bullshit ""altcoin"" can somehow keep pumping from the constant announcements about another ""summit"" or ""in 6 months we're planning this"". I'll stick to the crypto that's creating a use case and now has better potential for more use case in the future.

"I have a question in all seriousness... I see so much about mass adoption an all the reasons why it can‚Äôt happen. Well I‚Äôm wondering why do you NEED mass adoption to moon. I think there is an idea that you need this to be like the phone - everyone all over the world has one. But what if people are using blockchain tech without even knowing it because the projects built on block chain are built into the system. Take ripple for example - people aren‚Äôt going to be like oh I‚Äôm so happy that ripple is helping me transfer funds internationally at lightening speed. They won‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs behind these transactions and the tech making it happen.  But once it‚Äôs theoretically implemented into banks on a global scale, lots of people will be using ripple without knowing it (assuming you don‚Äôt need ripple coin or token or whatever it‚Äôs called at this point to send money). I think where this really goes off is that some Crypto literally get used as currency and for exchange but most crypto are investments in useful projects designed on block chain to make the world run better. To me it‚Äôs sort of misleading to call it crypto currency because for the most part I don‚Äôt think this is about currency and transactions that we think about while using FIAT. It‚Äôs more about the block chain tech and we are buying ‚Äústock‚Äù In the idea. Once the idea becomes implemented then you own the stock or coin in that project/company.

"This is a common misconception, that forking is bad. That's not entirely true, it just comes with a risk of people continuing to run on the older fork for political reasons. 

Some forks are intentionally political, too. The user activated soft fork (UASF) was an example of a political fork in support for a developer-intended fork. Many devs at the time wanted the fork to go through, but it required 95% acceptance and there was miner's reluctance to accept the fork without political compromise. The users running Bitcoin notes, however, overwhelmingly demanded that segwit be activated or they would cause a fork that had it, thus very likely killing the fork that did NOT have segwit in the long run. 

Some devs helped the users with their demands and the UASF succeeded, but not before some ""titans of industry"" blowhards tried to elevate their status by pretending to broker an agreement between miners and users, which was really just them telling the miners to throw support behind them so that they could say they succeeded later on and thus get to dictate Bitcoin policy into the future. They called their solution SegWit2X, and claimed they were working with users. But what really happened is they didn't communicate AT ALL with the users and ultimately capitulated to the users demands, who were going through with a UASF for segwit no matter what. They attempted to create a miner activated fork with SegWit2X, but support for it among users was very light and even outright hostile in some cases. They ""canceled"" it in November, which to everyone's surprise showed just how centralized the ""movement"" for the SegWit2X fork really was.",1524063508

"Entry was a bit daunting for me. I wanted to buy VTC as my first alt coin. Going from coinbase and not understanding exactly how the addresses and stuff worked took me a while. I was watching youtube videos to better understand what I was doing. It took a good week of research before I was able to trust myself enough to throw 100 bucks at coinbase, then get the nerve to transfer it to bittrex. After the first time it wasn't a big deal, but a lot of people don't have the guts to potentially lose 100 bucks.   
  
I didn't have anyone that was guiding me personally. It was all what I could find online. I have been in IT for 17 years, but not on the development side. Even for me it was one of those things I had to research like hell to make sure I thought I was being safe. Maybe the years in IT have made me too cynical about certain tech. 
  
It's that fear that keeps people from wanting to control their own money. Just think of the number of people that still refuse to buy things online. They'll waste a day going to different brick and mortar stores and finally find what they want, overpay for it, and then have to take it home or pay the store for delivery.

The same thing is going to happen in crypto. Hell, there are technologies that we don't even know that we need yet, which will tie and support the whole market. Once these start fleshing out more in the next 10 years, copycat central will take over again. 

The number of ICOs and coins out there will start to approach hundreds of thousands, or even millions. These will get funded from mostly ETH, and to a lesser extent some of the other platforms like Neo. These are massive money sinks into the market, and insane buy pressure for ETH.

I actually think that ETH is probably the single strongest play you can make for the next 3-4 years. Eth and maybe Neo.

"XBY may or may not be a scam, I personally don't think so, but your post is the definition of pure FUD. It offers zero evidence. I will tell you as someone who found XBY originally by reading the ENTIRE bitcointalk thread, that you have cherry picked parts to suit your narrative. If you are going to call something a scam, at LEAST find some compelling evidence.

There are very real concerns about XBY. Nearly all of them originate from Borzalom being the only one who has written / seen the key part of code which means we don't know if XBY's key code works correctly or even exists. However, if he did in fact spend the last few years writing code that can do what he thinks/hopes it can when he has next to zero funding / big time backing then if it weren't patented before release it would be scooped up and hijacked by other higher profile cryptocurrencies in seconds and the last few years of his life will have been wasted. It is literally in the investors best interest in addition to his own that this technology has some measure of protection, it would be idiotic to do otherwise.

There is of course the issue that the code may not be capable of what it was touted as. I actually believe this to be a factual certainty. You simply cannot predict how something will perform once it's actual in use. However, that is true of all cryptocurrencies. XBY does not need to be 10,000 TPS as stated to have significant value, if it only gets to say 1000TPS it will still have value and be beyond 99% of crypto currencies on the market today.

So yes, this is a high risk investment. It will go to zero, or it will yield incredibly high returns. All people who have invested in XBY are aware of this. Your post, however, is complete garbage. It is all conjecture, and in some cases outright false.

"Maybe, but your article also hinges on:

&gt; *If realization happens at the time of the fork*

Which I'm saying:  A fork is *arguably not* a realization event.

And even if it was,   the argument has still not been shown to say WHICH side of the fork should receive the  $0  basis.

Following a fork where a market or community split is involved --- it is a misnomer to call  EITHER  chain resulting from the fork   by the same name the chain had proceeding the fork.

Following the Bitcoin Cash fork,  it would be more accurate to call the two coins    ""Bitcoin-A"" and  ""Bitcoin-B"",

Because NEITHER coin that results from the fork is the same as the coin preceding the fork.    Ultimately it is up to the community and the marketplace to decide which coin will survive,    and if  one of the coins  continues  by the old name  it is only  through a  casual agreement with the forking parties that   ""This chain is more likely to be the dominant one,  for now"".

Because a portion of the community contends that  Bitcoins are the (A) side of the fork,  and another portion of the community contends that Bitcoins are the (B) side of the fork.

It's TOO ambiguous to say that  the percentage of people who believe the (B) side of the Fork will be the successor   should all move forward with a $0  cost basis for their Bitcoins,  and  people who believe the (A) side of the Fork will be the successor  should  move forward with a $0  cost basis for their Bitcoin Cash.

Why is it not a realizing event?  Because  realization as defined by Section 1001(a) and (b) of the IRC sets the definition of realization to be **an exchange** transaction through which the taxpayer receives money or other property.

Arising from the legal disputes, the Supreme Court limited ""realization"" events to 4 kinds of occurrences:

 * A property exchange
 * A relief of debt or legal obligation owed to a 3rd party
 * Relief of a legal obligation owed to a party receiving property, or, 
 * Other profit transactions.

Among these, only the fourth could conceivably apply to a Fork,  BUT it shouldn't,  since **A network fork is not a transaction**.

In all cases,  realization requires a **transaction**,  to which  the one  ""realizing""  a gain or loss is a  party to this transaction.

A Fork is not like a dividend,  or other thing,  where value holders ""own shares"", ""bonds"", or other ""debts"" in a corporation,  that in theory entitle the shareholders legally to a share in the company's profits,  which the company legally owes the shareholders,  and  the corporation in theory makes joint decisions  where the shareholders and management agree    at what frequency and rates the regular dividend payouts will occur ---  Thus a  Dividend or Interest paid on a bond is a property exchange that satisfies a legal obligation of the company or debtor to the shareholder or creditor,  therefore these payments are realization events,   BUT a fork is not like these,  since 
 there is no party that has a  legal obligation  to create forks or  distribute forked coins.

The Bitcoin miners **do not even have a fiduciary duty** to users of the network;  they act upon their own interest,   And  there's no operation by which address holders have a binding vote or agree to assign a vote in the outcome of  system changes,  such as those leading to a fork.

A Fork does not involve a **transaction**  which the address ids involved conduct an exchange of property,   conduct a transaction on anything,  make any kind of decision,   and it's not a transaction in which a fiduciary or joint group of  address id owners makes a decision to transact  ""on behalf of""  address holders.

What is a fork?

A fork results either when there is a disagreement within the market between different computer systems  or miners,  and the participants in the network that run the protocol,  AND they result in the same participants holding their value in   multiple Alternate coins.

Forked chains either exist persistently or die or aren't formed at all by operation of the marketplace,  and the  holder of  an address id with forked coins is not  'a party'  to a transaction:   doesn't necessarily have any say in it  ----  and may not even become aware of it,   because there  is no communication involved.

In theory there can be 1000 forks of the Bitcoin network which the public has just not become aware of yet.

Meanwhile, crypto (read angel investing or venture capital investing 2.0) is open to the main street investors rather than only VC and angels.

"Chase has a serious grudge against Bitcoin.

On the one hand; Chase has never given me issues about buying Bitcoin. I've made many, many regular buys with my Chase account for years. 

When I went to sell some to use as a downpayment for the purchase of a home; I made an appointment with the mortgage lender/loan officer at my local branch. I told him that I wanted to use proceeds from Bitcoin to fund my downpayment; and I wanted to make sure I could do so before I sold or started putting offers on homes.

I told him I'd heard horror stories and I wanted to make sure all my ducks were in a row before selling or putting in offers. He told me he needed to check with compliance and we scheduled a meeting for a week later.

Our meeting a week later begins and he is all smiles; ""No issues using Bitcoin proceeds as down payment. You're all clear to start putting down offers on homes"" ""Just make sure to have your documentation for when you purchased your BTC, the price, how much you sold for, dates, source funding, etc""

I told him that I would be selling in the next few days and that they should expect some large deposits and if there are any issues at all to please call me.

Thankfully as a Bitcoin saver I was easily able to calculate my cost basis (since there have only been buys, never sells or trades). I had a nice little report that showed the chase account the fiat was withdrawn from, the date, and the purchase amount of BTC on Coinbase. And a corresponding report that showed the Bitcoins being sold, the price, and the deposit into the same Chase account.

So I sold some Bitcoin; I was happy to see that Coinbase made the deposits quicker than I expected; 2-3 days.

I ended up having an offer on a home accepted within a couple of days. Appraisal and inspection go off without issues. Then just waiting for final approval for the financing.

On the last day of the financing window; Chase called to tell me they were denying my loan because they do not allow Bitcoin proceeds to be used as downpayment.

Well I flipped my shit. I did my due diligence. I went in, in advance to make sure this exact scenario did not occur. I did everything exactly as they asked.

As a result of selling; I am facing quite a large tax bill. I never would have sold any if it weren't to buy a home. I sold on Chase's advice that I could use those funds; and then only after the money is deposited into their bank do they say I cannot use those funds.

Well the rest is an even longer story; but essentially I pushed back, hard. I told them I felt this was fraud. I went into the bank and demanded my balance in cash. When of course they didn't have money on hand I made a big stink at the branch asking if they were insolvent; ""Where is my money?.""

I filed a complaint with the CFPB; and then took my case to Twitter. Within 15minutes of complaining on Twitter I was called by the corporate office and they decided they would work with me to review the situation and get my loan approved.

Eventually after providing their underwriters every single BTC transaction, and essentially going through an audit; they decided to approve the loan and gave me some money to compensate for the inconvenience.

The biggest thing I learned is that underwriters are completely unprepared to deal with Bitcoin.

They simply have no tools or understanding. Even though I never sold any BTC, and I bought it all directly through Coinbase with a Chase bank account; because I transferred my balance at regular intervals to my cold-storage solutions; it confused matters greatly for them. 

Even if they can see that you purchase 1BTC for $500 and then its sent to address ""A"" and then 1BTC is sent from address ""A"" to Coinbase ; and see that the transaction date from address ""A"" corresponds to the funding date for Coinbase; they don't understand.",1524059812

Other coins with lower block times have systems that reward adding orphan blocks to the current block (eths uncles and so on) that bitcoin don't do.

&gt;Hard forks are possible, I'm not against hard forks as a concept. But unless the majority of the consensus follows you get an altcoin on an orphan chain.

What if a soft fork is forced on the network and change Bitcoin fundamentals and incentives?

There was many attempts to compromise.

When it clearly appears that core dev wanted to make small block a permanent economic feature of bitcoin, some peoples started a fork (BCH). The purpose of that fork was to continue the original experiment.

U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Litigation Release No. 23885 / July 25, 2017

Securities and Exchange Commission v. Homero Joshua Garza, GAW Miners, LLC, and ZenMiner, LLC, No. 15-cv-01760 (D. Conn. filed Dec. 1, 2015)

United States v. Homero Joshua Garza, No. 17-cr-158 (D. Conn. filed July 20, 2017)

Former Connecticut Resident Pleads Guilty to Criminal Charges in Connection With Digital Bitcoin Mining Fraud

On July 20, 2017, Homero Joshua Garza, a defendant in a pending SEC civil fraud action, pled guilty in federal court in Connecticut to criminal charges in connection with his scheme to defraud investors in a digital bitcoin mining fraud in 2014 and 2015. Garza is currently scheduled to be sentenced in October 2017.

The criminal charge arises largely from the same conduct alleged in¬†the SEC's complaint¬†filed on December 1, 2015.¬†The SEC¬†alleged that GAW Miners and ZenMiner, along with their principal, Garza, purported to offer shares to investors in their digital bitcoin mining operation. Mining for bitcoin or other virtual currencies means applying computer power to try to solve complex equations that verify a group of transactions in that virtual currency. The first computer or collection of computers to solve an equation is awarded new units of that virtual currency. According to the SEC's complaint, GAW Miners and ZenMiner did not own enough computing power for the mining they promised to conduct, so most investors paid for a share of computing power that never existed. Returns paid to some investors came, not from successful mining activity, but from proceeds generated from sales to other investors.

On June 2, 2017, the court¬†entered a final judgment against GAW Miners and ZenMiner, permanently enjoining each of them from violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordering each entity to pay, jointly and severally, approximately $10 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $1 million each. Both GAW Miners and ZenMiner have ceased their former business operations.

The SEC's litigation continues against Garza.

Your err of superiority and arrogance is really off-putting, so I'm not really interested in continuing the conversation. But I'll also add that if course Bitcoin can update it's consensus to POS, but POS is still very inflexible in comparison to more modern consensus algorithms. And radical changes to things like algorand's protocol, or Orbs, or anything based off ghost or spectre, will be very difficult to just implement and will take a very long time.

"**Bitcoin Price Defends $8K But Pullback Still in Play**

https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-bounces-back-from-sudden-dip-eyeing-move-to-8400/

Bitcoin (BTC) remains on the hunt for a major bullish breakout after bouncing back from an overnight dip.

Prices hit a four-day low of $7,823 yesterday reportedly due to whale dumping over $50 million-worth of the cryptocurrency in one Bitfinex trade. The news that New York's attorney general is taking a closer look at major cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the state may also have dampened the bull mood.

The sudden price drop raised the possibility that the rally from the April 1 low of $6,425 had run out of steam.

However, BTC's sharp return from $7,873 to $8,160 this morning established the area around $7,800 as a strong support level and indicates a strong dip-demand mentality in the market. For the second time in the last three days, a dip below the $8,000 mark was quickly undone.

The recovery witnessed this morning adds credence to the bullish moving average studies.

As of writing, BTC is trading at $8,090 on Bitfinex - largely unchanged on a 24-hour basis.

View
BTC will likely test supply around $8,400 in the next 24 hours. A high volume close (as per UTC) above that level would signal a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.
On the downside, $7,870 (today's low) is the key level to watch out for. BTC's failure to defend the key support level could yield a pullback to $7,510 (former resistance turned support).
Only a daily close below the ascending (bullish biased) 10-day MA would indicate the rally from the low of $6,425 has ended.",1524056226

For the cold wallet, I run Electron Cash on a Raspberry Pi with no connection to the internet.  I generated a new wallet (and backed up the seed words).  Export the Master Public Key (xpub) to a USB drive.

On another machine (say a laptop) I run Electron Cash and install the xpub (rather than seed words).  This is now a watch-only wallet, since it has all the addresses but not the private keys to sign transactions.

When I need to spend, I create the transaction on my laptop, then move the file to the USB drive.  On the Pi I load the transaction, sign it, and move it back to the USB drive.  Back on the laptop, I can broadcast the transaction.

While the USB drive introduces a possible attack vector, it is rather minimal (your mileage may vary).   QR codes could be used if I had a camera on the Pi, but then I would also need a screen to display the signed transaction.  There are certainly other options.

Security always involves trade-offs with convenience.  Cold storage is great for storing the majority of the crypto holdings, while keeping a small amount on a phone hot wallet is convenient.  If the private keys are never on a network-connected device, then it is much less likely to be hacked.

"Honestly you sound like the legacy Bitcoin community in 2014. They didn‚Äôt want to do anything either. Which is why Bitcoin never saw its potential. 

All they wanted to do was write code. And regular people were considered idiots. If you‚Äôre an engineer? You got street cred. If you wanted actually market or advertise or promote bitcoin? You were a dumbass who was wasting his time. 

I tried to get them to crown fund commercials like BitPpay did during the football game, and everybody shot me down. ‚ÄúNobody watches TV anymore, they watch YouTube‚Äù.  Nobody wanted to do anything. And look where bitcoin is today as far as marketshare. 

We are a different group. A large percentage of us that got banned from that community are business-minded and business-oriented. In fact that‚Äôs why we complained so loudly about preparing the coin for its capacity issues, while the developers had no concern for end-user problems. There‚Äôs a strong correlation here.

Other so-called blockchain experts never did that, they would shill why they liked this project but never actually broke them down completely like Ian did.

The hate is unreal for him and the only reason why I can think people dislike him so much is that later on, when 99.99999% of ICO's became shit projects he started morphing into a paid shiller but I will always be grateful for how he was in the beginning because he did something few other crypto people have done.

We at Anycoin Direct always recommend using the Electrum wallet if you choose to use a software wallet. This also allows you to use multisig and therefore guarantees an extra level of security. However many bitcoin users just don't have the need to secure their coins to this level. We have noticed that especially users of bitcoin who have invested smaller amounts have less need for this security. At Anycoin Direct we don't offer the option to store bitcoin via our website because we think everybody should keep their coins in their own wallet. This in order to make sure users secure their own coins and because the principal 'be your own bank' is an important concept in cryptocurrency.

It's another layer that's being developed by 3 different third party teams that doesn't even need Bitcoin.  Lightning can be slapped on any cryptocurrency.

What they've done is allow you to easily use Bitcoin and to buy it using fiat online.  This is insanely important for adoption and use as a currency.  Even Bitpay is extremely important to the ecosystem as whole.  Anything that makes it easier to spend Bitcoin is a net win for the community.

"What do you mean? Like my opinion on them using cryptos? Well I think that eventually, in like ten years or so and all the current teens are in their mid twenties, I think they'll try to jump on the bitcoin (or cryptos in general) bandwagon again, but that would be way too late. 

Right now, all my friends focus on just getting into good colleges or getting good grades and mundane things like that. Although I have the same goals, I want to become actually without even the help of college, so that's why I'm so into cryptos.

I think it's weird to be ok with this...

Verge isn't a 'privacy coin', it's bitcoin behind tor with some botched implementation of stealth addresses (which other coins already have for yours) which is now called wraith-protocol...

Currently quite a few retailers have problems with cart abandonment because consumers think the checkout process is too long/hard. This idea that a normal person is going to jump through all these conversion hoops and arcane wallet setups to buy something with crypto does not seem in line with consumer behavior. ,1524051776
"&gt; Would really suck as a merchant to get payments for supplies over several weeks, only to find that the channel is now 100% value owned by me

As a merchant, you would not end up in a situation where 100% of the channel value is owned by you. The counterparty has to have something at stake to justify keeping the channel open. So if somebody wants to pay you and fully deplete the channel by doing this, then it's a good idea to close the channel right at that time. So at least you don't have to wait and are fully aware of the current situation with on-chain fees.

&gt; I can't close the channel because the fee level rose between the last transaction and the expiratoin of the last transactions timelock.

That's why it is important to have predictable (and preferably low) fees for on-chain transactions and a non-congested network. BTC is not the only Lightning Network compatible coin and unless a solid network congestion prevention plan becomes a reality for BTC, the other cryptocurrencies with Segwit support might be preferable for early adoption of the Lightning Network for real use.",1524051765

"I agree with you that we all benefit when it becomes possible to pay with crypto on as many locations as possible, and porn sites should not be excluded in that regard.

It would change the world! Then he scheduled his announcement of the world changing partnership, hyping the price to extreme heights. Then, when it turned that the money was used to get Verge listed as a payment OPTION (among many others) on Pornhub, I can imagine that one would think it lacks in world changing characteristics. And off course, the price plummeted, because the big boys sell the news, and the news did not live up to the hype that was created. 

For any crypto project, let that be a lesson! Your community invests in you, and has given its trust that your project will succeed. Please be very careful with creating hype, announcing announcements and exaggerate the effects of your accomplishments by claiming you are going to change the world. You are going to get a lot of people exited and have that same people lose a lot of money. And that is why everybody is so negative about Verge!

"&gt;There is no trust needed here, you would know if you received a bogus transaction, because it wouldn't hash into the Merkle Tree.

Irrelevant. Without checking every single txs, I could receive a BCH block and consider it valid. Upon receiving a block, every txs is checked to see if it's valid. And this includes checking stuff like the block reward is what it's supposed to be, and that no one is spending money that they don't have. Merkle trees don't give you that information.

&gt;You would also know if you have the complete UTXO set, because you know based on block number, exactly to the Satoshi, how many coins are supposed to be in circulation.

Fail. No, you wouldn't, for two reasons. One, you **don't know how many Satoshi are in circulation today**. Oh, you think it's just a simple calculation of summing up all the block rewards, which are known? Sorry, try again. The coinbase tx is considered valid so long as it is **small or equal** to what you think it should be. And in fact, there are at least two episodes I'm aware of where the block reward was in fact **smaller**. On one occasion, a miner assigned themselves 1sat less than the full block reward, in honor of ""One missing Satoshi, who is absent from the community"". And in the second case, I think someone missed the full block reward of 12.5BTC after trying to merge mine RSK, and clearly didn't test the software well enough, which they are sure regretting to this day. Maybe there's more cases, but this you cannot know a priori, and someone would need to give you this information... i.e. a trusted party.

Second, even if you did know the total Satoshi in circulation, that's **not enough** to determine the validity of a UTXO set. That's simply because there's  infinite possibilities to make up any given number as a sum of numbers. And if you limit yourself to integers, the combinations are still very many. For example

10 = 9+1 = 8+2 = 7+3 = 6+4 = 5+5 = 4+6 = 3+7 = 2+8 = 1+9

and ""9+1"" =/= ""1+9"" in the sense that it refers to different ownership... so address A has 1, address B has 9 vs address A as 9, address B has 1. So you see, you CANNOT determine the validity of the UTXO set without **full validation of every single txs from the genesis block**. Period.

&gt;No. If you're really stating it's only 150 GB because that's all the mining pools can handle, then you're being extremely disingenuous.

&gt;Your mental gymnastics are insane


My mental gymnastics? I'll show you you're actually the one doing mental gymnastics, not me. And projecting.

I'm NOT stating 150GB because that's all mining pools can handle, where did I say that??? Do you know why I'm saying 150GB?

#Because that's the current [size of the blockchain](https://blockchain.info/charts/blocks-size)!!!


OK, I stand corrected, it's ~165GB as of today. My argument doesn't change... 2.1MB blocks would give you the same conclusion. Which is what I stated multiple times, **with ~2MB blocks the blockchain grows faster than tech improves**.


&gt;You really are missing the point, this whole second portion is just a ""what if someone wanted to actually keep the whole blockchain, even though it's unnecessary?""

It's not ""unnecessary"" if you want to spin up a full node from scratch. I've argued plenty on this. See above.

&gt;Well, then there's something wrong with how you came to your conclusion, because as I outlined, the hardware is available do 1 GB blocks today.

Yes... either that, or you are trying to squeeze out of an uncomfortable fact. But to admit being wrong is hard, so clearly **the other side** must be wrong.


&gt;And yet even Satoshi said Bitcoin could do ""much larger than"" Visa levels of transaction amounts in 2009, with the hardware available at the time, 9 whole years ago.

Ahhhhh.... here we go. Squeezed into a corner, appeals to authority. I think that's basically where I'll end the conversation, because I'm not trying to have a religious war, just debate the merits of tech, based on facts, not wishful thinking.

&gt;That you don't understand who this could be possible today, means that you're being intellectually lazy, because you don't care to find out how this could even be possible.

&gt;If you really think this would be impossible today, show me figures, hard data, and research.

&gt;It shouldn't be too hard seeing how strong your convictions are.


I already did above and in the previous post. Current size of the blockchain, ~165GB. 2.1MB blocks add ~66% space to the blockchain. This outpaces tech improvements.

#\#fact





&amp;nbsp;

Can you see how your desire to make big blocks work is really mental gymnastics? You must cite huge computational power, high bandwidth speeds and what have you to somehow justify that it all does work. But a simple argument based on historically proved tech improvements, which consequently **already includes all the advances you mention**, says something else. Btw, it was a rhetorical question... I'm sure you'll try to find ways to squeeze out of the conclusion. Unfortunately that conclusion is inevitable.

How many people are going to buy verge just to buy porn? Serious question? The only people that will use verge to buy porn are those jack offs that already hold large bags that want to pretend that this is great for their coin. Everyone else who buys porn is going to do it the way they've been doing it: with a debit card.

This is currency. This isn't some company. ""Partnerships"" will help adoption, sure, but at what cost? Verge is now funbucks. It isn't a currency, it is crank it chuck e cheese tokens. Money is to buy whatever you want. Verge might as well be a sloppy blowjob cumshot gift card. And they had to buy that?

Fuck that. Keep your eye on the prize. Adoption happens when a medium of exchange is useful. Things like shapeshift allow you to buy stuff with monero from any merchant that integrates it. If someone wants to do business with monero directly they can do it on their own, monero is useful on its own merit. We don't have to pay for some merchant to accept it, and doing so only marginally helps adoption. It isn't worth it. ""

If you mean the risk of a ""double spend"" or something, I don't know.

My point was, even for a few 100$ as a (Brick&amp;Mortar) Merchant, it is totally fine from the moment your wallet shows ""tx is coming"".
As an Onlinestore where you might order something, it is even less a problem, because it makes no difference if they start processing  your 700$ order 10 or 30 minutes later (1-3 Confirmations).
If you order a Pizza (15$) they will start immediately, but still have the chance to cancel the delivery, or give you a call, if something went wrong, which is highly unlikely.

Once again, no one that accepts bitcoin as an additional sort of payment in his Brick &amp; Mortar Store, will ever let you wait for confirmations, as the chance or probablility of a (successful) fraud attempt are tending against zero.

Fee prediction should be done by the wallet, yes, some of them could need a better estimate. But most wallets I know, give you a choice how much fee you want to add. And I never and nowhere had any problem with setting the fee to ""low / economy"", as all of the accepting Merchants knew and saw ""my Wallet says a legit tx is on its way and its extremly unlikely it won't arrive"".

I agree that it is already instant and actually trustless,
as soon as you ""grasp"" that it is near impossible a legit tx woudln't arrive or the customer could successfully ""game"" it.

In perspective and by this argument let me ask you this: do Merchants let their Customers wait for 4-6 Weeks, until the payment with a Creditcard is unrevokable and received?
No.

What Crypto Exchanges Are Saying About New York's New Inquiry

https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-exchanges-saying-nys-new-inquiry/

Some of the startups named today in the New York Attorney General's cryptocurrency exchange ""inquiry"" say they welcome the move.

As CoinDesk reported on Tuesday, the office of New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has launched an inquiry into 13 cryptocurrency exchanges. The exchanges named were Coinbase's GDAX, Gemini, bitFlyer USA, Bitfinex, Bitstamp USA, Kraken, Bittrex, Poloniex, Binance, Tidex.com, Gate.io, itBit and Huobi.Pro.

Schneiderman's office sent letters to the exchanges, along with a detailed questionnaire that probes the firms' ownership, leadership, operations, terms of service, privacy policies, trading volumes, use of ""bots,"" relationships with financial institutions - among other areas.

CoinDesk reached out to the 13 exchanges, and as of press time, five - Gemini, Bittrex, Poloniex, bitFlyer and Bitfinex - replied. Coinbase was not immediately available to comment, and the other exchanges have yet to respond to requests.

In a statement, Gemini CEO Tyler Winklevoss said his company ""applauds"" the Attorney General's inquiry, stating that ""we look forward to cooperating with and submitted our responses to the questionnaire.""

""We continue to embrace thoughtful regulation and collaboration on our mission to help build the future of money,"" he added.

A representative for Bittrex struck a similar note, also stating that the exchange welcomes the opportunity to respond: ""We look forward to working with NY Attorney General Schneiderman on our shared goal of improving transparency, accountability and security across all virtual currency trading platforms.""

Josh Hawkins, vice president of marketing at Circle, Poloniex's parent company, told CoinDesk:

""We welcome all initiatives focused on increasing transparency and accountability in the space and look forward to working with the New York Attorney General's office. Protecting crypto currency investors and consumers has always been Circle's first priority.""

BitFlyer USA, by way of compliance director Hailey Lennon, echoed the remarks about transparency, stating: ""Transparency is important for consumer protection in this industry. We received the letter from the New York Attorney General and are reviewing the requests asked of our US exchange.""

Kasper Rasmussen, communications director for Bitfinex, offered a more measured comment when reached.

""We can confirm that Bitfinex is aware of the New York Attorney General's inquiry regarding our operations, controls, and general user protections. Bitfinex is committed to compliance with authorities and regulators worldwide and we look forward to responding to this inquiry.""

When reached for follow-up comment on the launch of its inquiry, a spokesperson for Schneiderman's office said that ""we plan to make the information public at the end of the process since the goal here is to bring much-needed transparency and accountability to the crypto marketplace.""

She declined to ""comment or speculate"" about potential legal action against the exchanges.",1524046266

"Having 0 fee with boatload of other issues makes it not better alternative. 
It's promising but it still needs a LOT of work and some questions need to be answered and some features built and tested before we can even compare them.
I asked one simple question about Nano on their forum, suberddit and discord and i didn't get clear yes/no answer. Question was: ""are historic nodes needed once pruning is implemented"".
Thing is, if they are not needed that would make Nano open to attacks and if they ARE needed, than those nodes will be HUGE in term of storage and network bandwidth which will make Nano very very very centralized coin.
You see, there is no free lunch. If you want speed, you need to sacrifice something somewhere. Some coins will sacrifice storage, some bandwidth, some bit of both etc. 
Than, i was in discord when lead dev was asked about mitm attacks, and answer to them was: ""node needs to verify data with 50%+1 network nodes"". Imagine large network....now imagine how long would it take to do it.....
Anyway...nano is good idea that is far from being close to what it promises. BTC and LN are not.

Oh and, 0.0001$ fee (1 satoshi) and possible 0$ fee (as LN nodes can set 0 msatoshi fee) and 0$ fee all the time is really not that big of a deal when you consider other properties of the coins.",1524046087
"Hmm... Okay? I sort of fail to see how prostitutes dont sale sex directly even now. That's not so much a situation crypto can solve.... That's trying to address the legality of selling sex.

I'm very happy for those partnerships. Every win in crypto is a win for all of us.",1524045783
"If the 1 million BTC that satoshi has is sold, the price will go down. But it also puts more bitcoin into he market for others to buy it. If they do, prices will go back up again. I feel if prices go down low, many people will see it as a huge buying opportunity and will even borrow money to invest in it. This will drive prices back up. ",1524045782
"It is not though, unfortunately.

At least not where it counts. Sure, PH saw easy money and took it, $6mio give or take. It's great marketing for PH (and Verge) but in terms of adoption and technological implementation it is not a partnership by any means.

It doesn't take any effort to announce a partnership for PH when it's clearly just a marketing stunt...and you're even paid for it. 

Remember that the key to mass adoption is actually reaching these markets. PH has what..120mil users? Verge needs these users not the other way around so they take what they can get.

Ultimately, PH could announce a new ""partnership"" with a different coin that works exactly the same way in a few months or so. Which would make Verge obsolete.
As long this announcement doesn't require any technological adoption from PH they aren't dependant on Verge or any other crypto for that matter.

BTC originated from financial crisis in 2008 as a backlash to banks/gov that used taxpayers money to save their businesses. Banks got greedy and messed up living for many, many people. Hence community is a lot like anti-banks.


When it comes to Ripple. They have good idea, very good team, well connected to people in payment industry which means that they can pitch this blockchain thing to executives. However there is one thing that keeps me wonder. Ripple has a lot of partnerships but they don't use token to run transactions even tho Ripple pitched it as 67% saving opportunity on fees. Question remains, why? Maybe companies are not confident enough to actually use XRP as of yet. Maybe it will take time to try out XRP in real environment. I have no idea. Time will tell but it's worth having one eye on small print when it comes to announcements.",1524045613
"Why would it matter if the government made bitcoin? Bitcoin is simply an idea. Furthermore, bitcoin threatens the control governments have, so why would the government willingly cede control? ",1524045554
"It could be. The difference I see this time is that the volume increases gradually with price (check BCH/BTC chart). In past ""pumps"" there was a huge spike in volume out of nowhere, just like in BTC today. Today's BCH growth feels more organic than any in past weeks.",1524045518

"But the best part is, LN isn't even BTC lol. If it's not on the chain, it's not BTC ;\). You're transferring an IOU around BTC. Funny how the community thinks that the best solution for BTC's performance problems is...not using BTC at all.",1524043205

"If you are asking this question now... you are way too late to the game.

Youre having meetings with experts... cryptos have been around for six years. Experts launch coins. And Experts have been in it for years. Its not a very welcoming community. 

Take this from someone who has launched multiple coins. Over many years, mined on the largest pools, listed on trex, poloniex, mintpal... yea... thats right... thats how far back. 

Are you at all familiar with The GOD paper? Do you know what the CryptoCartel is? 

There are a lot of people including myself who got into bitcoin and loaded up at 200, 300, 400 per coin, mining hundreds, thousands, of coins. 

Likely the experts youre planning to meet with will gladly take your money, and screw you over bigtime on the exit. Youre jumping into a shark tank. ",1524043134
"&gt;Like I mention, we are still in the early phases. I think in the next 20 years another coin will finally take over bitcoin. We will never know until time tells.

Very much this.  A lot about bitcoin was decided arbitrarily with little economic expertise or forethought.  It was an experiment.  A lot has to change to make it work the way you and many others dream of it working.

&gt;Ohh yea and don‚Äôt you think the early adaptors for believing in this should be paid......

Not unless they sell now, or at some point between now and then.  The world doesn't work that way.  Shouldn't all the investors in pets.com and other failed dot-coms be paid for believing in ecommerce early?  No.  Not unless you lucked out in picking Amazon and holding for 20 years.",1524042994

"**Payment Services Directive**

The Payment Services Directive (PSD, Directive 2007/64/EC, replaced by PSD 2, Directive (EU) 2015/2366) is an EU Directive, administered by the European Commission (Directorate General Internal Market) to regulate payment services and payment service providers throughout the European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA). The Directive's purpose was to increase pan-European competition and participation in the payments industry also from non-banks, and to provide for a level playing field by harmonizing consumer protection and the rights and obligations for payment providers and users.

"Dude. Your comment history is almost exclusively shitting on NANO, day after day. What's the deal? You aren't even making sense most of the time. If you want to say that NANO is flawed. So be it. But why exactly is a free and instant cryptocurrency not useful/ so upsetting to you? 

Second question: who the fuck has the time to go around exclusively being an asshole? 

In the end, joke's on you. I'm sorry that the xrb crowd shilled so hard in December and January. Surely you can understand 24 year olds getting rich for the first time having an exciting and exuberant experience. It's crypto, the project has almost no say in who and how their coin is promoted, shilled or FUDed. 

Nano will be just fine. Maybe not in your little pinhole of a perspective or timeline. But I have nothing but for admiration for a team that can see how vital it is to nail down the tech before having Verge type hypefests. They aren't going out making outrageous claims. People just get carried away. If you follow their discord and github, you'll see a modest, hardworking team and community that is trying to lay low and use this bear as an advantage to get the back end work done instead of trying to find a pump every 5 seconds. 

Volume and capital will return to this market. And I'm so glad the buttholes like you have taken it upon themselves to keep the FUD strong. My brainwashed little stack has doubled. My knowledge of the team, project and tech has quadrupled, and I've had a constantly deflating store of value to pump for 3 months. No better way to build a fat stack. 

Thank you oh loathsome one. ",1524042237

1. Bitcoin does protect a key holders funds, it doesn't however protect you from yourself or loosing your private keys... yet

2. Perhaps you might be less dismissive of the concerns highlighted above if it was your money, not your dads. Be that as it may, it is far more concerning that you are unable to distinguishing between using custodial services such as MTGox (exchanges) or even Ponzi schemes such as Bitconnect.

3. We've all come to the realisation that bitcoin is not anonymous many year ago, it's pseudonymous

4. Your circumstances of these events occurring do not make it less of a problem, your dismissal of them based on frequency are however concerning to say the least

5. Don't be fooled by the majority of opportunists out there trying to distinguish blockchain as being the innovation behind bitcoin, or even worse, separating it

"I'm no XVG bagholder, but I kinda like what they're doing for the community as a whole, it gives crypto publicity, regardless of whether it's good or bad publicity. As for the XVG project itself, it doesn't seem too good as the price doesn't seem to reflect the news.",1524041906
"Hmm it's really a combination of stop losses, whales, and the rest of the market. If something truly is going to pump the whales won't fight it. But since practically everyone knows that everyone else is going to dump unless its some out of this world news, most people sell. Stops get triggered and price plummets.

 The really big players mostly just deal in Bitcoin. Every once in a while they will pump and dump some alts. In theory they could pump a coin even as the news is released and screw over the shorters, but it's probably just easier and more profitable for them to accentuate the movement that's wanting to happen anyway.",1524041874

"&gt; it is very important to be able to discuss openly and without top down manipulation interfering with the expression of reasoned points of views

Correct.

Community wide agreement, or consensus as it is called outside of Bitcoin, clearly can be interfered with.  

When it has been interfered with, by withholding disclosure, or sockpuppeting, or whatever method, there still results a majority opinion.

Now consider that all machines work for us.  How then is consensus in Bitcoin not modifiable?  Don't we need to pay attention to *all* variables in how said consensus is reached?

"I have zero in verge. I actually have XLM because i believe it will outperform other cryptos including XVG longterm. What verge did was essentially increased their survivability in a highly unstable market by capitalizing on a very niche. No single crypto will likely do everything. There will be cryptos out there that will survive and grow more slowly in very niche markets. This is good for crypto as a whole because the more different markets cryptos influence the more value people will place in general. In this context, it is not a competition between verge and XLM. You still have this sporting team mentality where you have to only blindly root for your team. This slows the progress of blockchain technology. XLM with IBM is great. iota with Bosch is great. And yes XVG with Mindgeek is Great. They are all great for crypto adoption. That's the point. You see that right?",1524041496
"Yes. THE use case many people do not understand in the west where the answer often is ""why do I need bitcoin, just open a bank account"". Either this is not working (no banks easily around and accessible) or you simply can not trust them.

"&gt;I was paraphrasing you.

No, you weren't. You were creating a strawman argument. I've never claimed ""Lightning Network is simple"" and in fact I've argued the exact opposite on numerous occasions. An example from [a month ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8543k4/can_we_discuss_this_ln_attack_here/dvvwkle/): ""**The Lightning Network is remarkably tricky to properly understand on a conceptual level; I've had to read the original whitepaper multiple times (often needing to set it aside for an hour or two to digest specific sections) in order to get a decent grasp of even the basics of the model.**""

Your misrepresentations do not constitute you ""paraphrasing"" what I'm saying, they're simple [strawman arguments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man):

&gt;A straw man is a common form of argument and is an informal fallacy based on giving the impression of refuting an opponent's argument, while actually refuting an argument that was not presented by that opponent. One who engages in this fallacy is said to be ""attacking a straw man.""

Congratulations on arguing against things I didn't say or claim, though. 

At this point, it's looking obvious that you're a sockpuppet just here to troll, though. You don't understand [degrees of separation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8cv5hi/i_dont_know_guys_but_this_lightning_network_is/dxj1v5q/), you don't understand [terms like ""centralized"" and ""decentralized""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8cv5hi/i_dont_know_guys_but_this_lightning_network_is/dxjrj3z/), you're [deliberately going out of your way to misrepresent others](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8cv5hi/i_dont_know_guys_but_this_lightning_network_is/dxizdjw/), and you apparently [aren't able to make any meaningful contributions](https://www.reddit.com/user/Cathain_Eolas) to the discussion from your two-week-old account.

2) If there is ""no accurate"" way to decide when the bearmarket is over, TA is obviously a scam, right?

Simply said, you will lighten your mental burden using the method. You can't lose USD. Literally. 
And since there is ""no way to decide when the bear market is over"", there is no way to see the bottom of this, right? 

Your mindset is losing people a lot of money. Loss that could have been avoided. Holding is not only flawed, it's mentally taxing to see your money vanish, when anyone could prevent that with ease.

I just hadn't actually seen that on any sites. I haven't reviewed payment options for any premium porn sites.

Though I also think the coins / projects designed to be currencies for porn are probably more likely to recieve widespread adoption.

"&gt; Adoption starts when using crypto requires no explanation.

To be fair, a lot of things these days still require explanation, despite widescale adoption. Paypal is a good example. Verifying and linking Paypal to bank / CC, takes a about as much effort as it took me to set up Binance, or Coinbase.

Also, coins are generally on exchanges, despite personal wallets. So it has the added complexity of having to learn a bit about how they work. Plus learning about addresses, coin values, etc. But so do credit cards - dealing with account #, expiry, confirmation codes, interest rates, points programs. Consumers are pretty smart when the technology is of value to them.

There are some unnecessary steps in the way of crypto adoptions. But the platform WILL have to be learned, just like people to learn internet browsers, cell phones, email programs, etc. in the beginning. There will always be some effort involved in entry, and some of effort will be about privacy / security / account setups and ensuring transactions are verified / valid. 

I don't think most of these things are barrier to entry. However, the willingness to go through these steps will depend on value to the consumer. And that isn't quite there yet. Just like Paypal, consumers will have to be given options where the crypto option becomes most desirable. Also not there yet",1524036178

What the fucking fuck?'  ""oh, 99 satoshi"" 'ok, what is 99 satoshi?  I'm old, I never got this bitcoin thing' ""99 cents"".

"Blockstream. It's a variation of ""trust, but verify"" which is an old cryptography saying (and a Russian proverb before that). It was suggested by Johnny Dilley to be the unofficial motto for the first Scaling Bitcoin workshop, for which Blockstream provided printed T-shirts. However the phrasing isn't quite right for bitcoin--we verify so that we shouldn't have to trust at all. Some iteration among the engineers (I remember Pieter Wuille and Warren Togami having comments, probably others too), and we came up with ""Don't trust. Verify.""",1524035791

"Verge takes privacy to the next level? haha ok lets take a look at  look at ""Wraith protocol"" that does not exist, it was just a hypeword for optional stealth adresses invented in 2014. Something that any coin can use. It's a wallet level feature, not protocol level. They are also worthless by themselves for privacy, especially if they are optional.

""So the only difference with stealth addresses is essentially to move the chore of producing a unique address from the server to the client. Indeed, in some ways stealth addresses may be worse, since very few people use them, and if you are known to be one of them, it will be easier to connect stealth transactions with you.

It doesn't provide ""100% anonymity"". The fundamental anonymity weakness of Bitcoin remains - that everyone can follow the chain of payments, and if you know something about one transaction or the parties to it, you can deduce something about where those coins came from or where they went.""

""I was in Verge team when Wraith protocol was ""invented"" by M.Stolaire at those times. The name was intentionally picked to be catchy and proclaimed to be some sort of new tech. Then it was hyped properly. Noobs don't bother what tech it does, McAfee tweets, noobs see price under $, see price of Bitcoin over 15k$ and buy and fomo others. Same now. Xvg net attacked, main dev writes in telegram and other channels its normal and that's it. Fanatic comunity just say nothing happened. Now the hype with partnership is steaming and nobody cares about attack. ‚Äú Speculation :that partnership gonna be very probably with German Bank and they will release xvg debit cards. Imagine Verge chain being attacked in future, how you will pay with such card. Useless. And I'm not even talking about that when I was in team dev said xvg will NEVER partnership with bank, ever. Because it is anonymous, decentralized currency.‚Äú W/e. he lies so often, that it does not matter what he says. One of the reason I left team after June, July, August roadmap kept postponing and stayed undelivered without explanation to us as a team or to comunity. ""
