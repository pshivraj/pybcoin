You know this would actually be really nice. We could accumulate Next Generation graphics cards at good prices. Mine our favorite altcoins. Collect more Bitcoin. Just continue on with life and not even really think about it . then one day you hear that word on the news. Bitcoin. You march on over to gdax. It's been in up trend for a few months. You continue to watch and parabolic run number 3 eventually takes place. You sell a large part of your holding for a good deal of money. Buy a house or another house and the car of your dreams. Then you catch AIDS from a hooker. No wait that's a bad ending. I really need to work on my endings,1526626528

The only way for XRP to win is to basically be a private central bank. Which the banks, money transmitters and governments will fight them on.  It will never ever happen.  

Ripple will bring and get some test cases. But that will be the end of it.  

XRP is only valuable because its ""only"" a dollar and Bitcoin is $8000.  Goto coinmarketcap and the first thing every single newbie says is RIPPLE.  

Every single newbie buys it with the hope of it skyrocketing. Then hedge funds got it also because they thought more newbies will buy. Then Koreans liked it because jr was cheap and koreans currency is the WON which is 1/1000 of a dollar. 

But the flip side is it will crash just as hard.  Plus since centralized if one indictment or one court case happens it will goto zero.  

Coinbase and Gemini will never trade Ripple for these reasons as well.

You could sit on those stock shares (though $100 will not buy much of either company -- Amazon is over $1500), but $100 in any stock is not going to fund college for the kids.  Bitcoin might, because it's highly speculative.

For a long time, people have said Bitcoin will either go to $1M or go to $0.  They might be right.  It's been quite an interesting rollercoaster ride so far.  Sadly, it's one I can't really stomach.  I'll just have to sit on the sidelines and watch everyone go bust or get rich. :)

Now we have Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, with supporters in each camp claiming that _they_ are users of the _real_ Bitcoin.  They had disagreement with each other before the fork and they have disagreements after the fork.  Both sides will say the other is illegitimate (or use stronger language).

Both have value, because the camps appear to be fairly sizably split.  Plus, those who had Bitcoin before the hard fork own both BTC and BCH now, and most people just do not care.  That helped immediately create value in the new coin.  If I were to go fork Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash in the same way, it might also be successful.  After all, there will be a fairly large number of people who would say, ""Cool!  I own Bitcoin-Œ± coins now!""

IMO, the rivalry is destructive to both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.  Each side is trying to move forward, while bashing the other side.  Not everyone is, of course.  Some just view these as more-or-less the same as Litecoin or any other coin, buying and selling in hopes to make a profit.  However, I think the rivalry is helping to potentially derail Bitcoin and crypto-currencies in general.  How can the general public trust either?  How can they be sure there will not be another fork and they just lose their money due to disagreement among developers and users?",1526623078

"This proposal addresses a fundamental challenge facing us in gaining mainstream retail adoption.  Nobody is used to paying for things that cost 0.00047241.  Nobody is comfortable doing the maths on these fractions without a calculator and even then human error continues to be a risk.  For these reasons the only way we can use bitcoin is to convert it back into fiat.  I've been using it for years and I'm well above average in numeracy but I've never done a transaction without considering the fiat equivalent value.  This is not a healthy situation when we are trying to get people to think in crypto as their base currency ultimately.  

I agree with the thrust of the proposal around the importance of the psychology around having more of something rather than a tiny fraction of something.  People considering taking the plunge to buy bitcoin to use as cash are going to be way more comfortable paying $20 and getting a few thousand bits knowing that they can throw some 100 bit tips around or paying 500 bits to access some content online.

Overall I support the proposal but recognise the challenge in implementing it.  There will never be unanimous support,  the ney-sayers will be added noise.  The ticker change is perhaps the most difficult part, there are many exchanges that are all busy with building their businesses and on-boarding new coins rather than doing something equivalent to a stock-split (a relatively untested exercise).  Has any sounding been taken to an exchange's willingness to implement this change been taken?  I would suggest this would be worth doing before there is extended debate on that point.  If there is a clear reluctance on their part then this is a factor in the discussion.

I would also add that this initiative is another demonstration of the true decentralised nature of the BCH community.  This is not an easy topic to address, but addressed it must be.

First user experience is important. Bitcoin Cash has a superior first user experience. You can even send it to people on social media. And for some reason I never ever see Bitcoin Core tips being made. 

When you send a Bitcoin Cash tip of a dollar, you can send that back and forth like at least 99 times before it runs out. 

When you send a Bitcoin Core tip, not even 10 times if you are lucky. Plus most websites will have you wait at least 3 confirmation ore more.

While websites likes yours or servives like cryptonize.it don't make you wait at all. 

Not waiting is something people really like. So how is Bitcoin Core ever going to attract new users?

"A few misconceptions: A block PoW does not on only secure the transactions in the current block, but all transactions in the past and in the future. Also, LN allows massive scaling, which reduces the energy footprint of a payment by order of magnitudes. If compared to fiat based transactions one has to take into account the cost of maintaining a stable fiat system which requires the operation of an elaborated state ranging from extensive regulation to powerful military. PoS provides less security, since stakes could be obtained through force (e.g. confiscation of stakes of regulated stake holders). Reduction of reward does reduces energy consumption only if the fiat price remains stable. In other words, the energy invested is a function of the product fiat price and reward, not only the reward in BTC units.
But don't worry, Bitcoin won't consume all energy of the planet, because it makes no sense economically. There will be an economic equilibrium for the power consumption long before that.

It cannot, as I just said before independent chain with different consensus rules is a concept that didn‚Äôt even exist at the time.

(And such d√©finition don‚Äôt relate to any code nor nodes behavior so it has nothing to do in a white paper)

&gt;That claim is foundational to the justification Satoshi gives for why we can have confidence in the future consistency of a chain's ledger. As the sole majority chain built from SHA256d, the only way that BTCs future consistency can be violated is if the majority of SHA256d capacity defects. As a minority chain built from SHA256d, BCHs future consistency can be violated by less than a majority of capacity.

‚ÄúMinority chain‚Äù concept don‚Äôt exist in the white paper, nor in the code.

Bitcoin nodes (BTC or BCH) are not even aware of chain with diferent consensus rules.

What you are talking about is more community consensus in the wider mean of the term (and only one parameter of it: the hash rate support), with is an important data but is a different thing.

 yes

Perhaps it just started to move. The volume is for the last 24 hours and it only started generating volume. (Volatility always generates volume).

In the stock market, this is well known because you're charged different fees (often significant) depending if you're adding or removing liquidity. So you need to know about it and what effect it has on price. But in crypto, it's all to easy to overlook. Sometimes both sides are willing to remove liquidity and you get a spread.

If it's not in public view, it can't be ruled out, however unlikely or nefarious one may think it to be.

Lets play a little with this idea. Lets say exchanges together put 50 btc in liquid. Now they get the idea to act as if liquid is for fractional reserve and tell each other there is 60 btc there instead, and start to lend each other btc somehow. Now, the 50 ""liquid coins"" are instead worth 80% of their original value. So if you didnt loan ant liquid coins youd be down 20% unless you hurry tf out. Ok, lets say everyone participates. Why would the individual exchanges simply not just cook their own internal books and add 10 btc there? Liquid seems overly complicated... And transparent to do this.

"The entire security mode of Satoshi's bitcoin was based upon miner profit. 

He build a mechanism where following the rules of the network is magnitudes more profitable then trying to break the rules. 

His first problem was how to release the coins. He solved that with a feedback system that ensures that every 10 minutes coins are released by people running the network and processing the transactions. And he made the currency deflationary instead of inflationary by halving the generation reward in half every 4 years.

So you have a steady supply that becomes smaller at a predictable rate. This is all economics, that's very important. Just because software works does not mean it makes any sense in the real world. The dynamics between software and human beings is very important. 

So now there was an incentive for people to be part of the network and play by the rules. As long as the rewards for playing honest outway the rewards for attacking it by like a factor of 1000 or larger. (currently it's waaaaaay larger) 

But now there is a second problem, how does the network stay secure after the generation reward becomes smaller and smaller. 

The only solution is for there to be a fee on the transactions. The more transactions are done, the saver the system because the incentive for securing the network will come from that.

Any blockchain system that does not have that mechanism should not call itself blockchain but something else.

"&gt; &gt; The users of that toy network did not join it because they found it useful. They are all LN believers who joined in order to support the Cause. So you cannot use it to predict what the real LN might look like. (Quite probably, it will never exist.)

&gt;  This is purely your opion

Which of those three claims is ""this""?

I stand corrected on the first claim. Only some of the users of that toy network joined to help he Cause.  Some of them instead believed the hype of Stark &amp; co, and joined because they expected that they would be able to pay frappucinos at Starbucks through the LN, and it would be much better than credit cards or PayPal.  Those were of course thoroughly disappointed.

You definitely cannot use that toy network to predict what the real LN might look like.  It is like watching a porn movie for insight about what marriage will be like.

The third claim, that a real LN will never exist, is indeed my opinion, but based on realistic analysis of the design.

&gt; [That a user can create many nodes is] not a curious detail at all.

That ""feature"" makes the statistics meaningless.  The mainnet LN has now 2000 nodes; but how many **users** does it have?  It may be that a single user created 1900 of the nodes, to inflate the adoption figures, or just to ""stress-test"" some software... 

&gt; There is already work on the next iteration which will encompass watch towers.

Watchtowers (previously called ""bounty hunters"", then ""watchers""; maybe ""Jehovah Witnesses"" next?) were not implemented yet because there are many problems with the concept, that do not seem to have any solution in sight.

One problem is is that they make the network much ""heavier"", since every payment through a bidirectional payment channel (BPC) must be promptly communicated to a Watcher.   The Watcher then can use timing analysis to discover the hops of a multi-hop payment path.  The watcher also must be trusted to not accept bribes by fraudulent parties.  

Then there is the question of how the Watchers would be paid.  The Watcher for a BPC must keep information about most of the past payments that went through it, for the life of the BPC, even if the BPC is no longer being used.  It can use a Bloom filter to quickly scan the blockchain for all the transactions he has to watch, but still must store individual data for each tx.  It cannot do its service free of charge, since it would then be exposed to spam attacks.  Then it would have to charge a small fee for each tx that it has to watch? And for each month that it must keep watching?

&gt; In the same way SPV clients trust full nodes to not censor tx a mobile wallet will rely on a watch tower to catch activity they may miss.

If miners refuse to process transactions, that is just a denial of service; it does not result in lost money.  But if a watcher fails to do its job, the user or hub may see old LN payments reversed, thus losing money.

And Watchers will not solve the problem of users having to be online (on a machine that has their blockchain keys)  in order to receive a  payment.  Which is not true of PayPal, bank transfers, or even on-chain bitcoin payments, in case you have missed.

&gt; Quite an embarrassing but not surprising misunderstanding here. First of all there the option to set both local and push remote balances when you open a channel. Which would be common place if you are expecting immediate payments on your channel.

Ah, the miracles of blind faith!

A ""push balance"" is a fancy name for a **donation** of $100 to the guy on the other side of channel, so that, if he ever needs to send you money, he can use that money instead of his own.  

Ant he of course can close the channel at any moment, even immediately, and keep any part of those $100 that he has not yet sent back to you.

I find it difficult to imagine some idea more stupid than that one.

&gt; Otherwise, given the assumption that a sufficiently connected wallet will manage somewhere between 3-5 channels, you can simply rebalance

Read again what I wrote:

&gt; if Alice has three channels to hubs, which she funded with $100 total, but has only paid $5 so far, she cannot receive more than $5 through those channels.

If she spent $2 through one channel and $3 through another, she can use channel rebalancing to get a $5 balance all in the same channel. Then she can receive a payment for $5.  But there is no rebalancing that will let her receive more than $5 -- until she spends some more.

And, since rebalancing involves at least one other node, it will cost some middleman fees, of course.

&gt; [Impossibility to see usage] is also a privacy feature but you obviously ignored that.

By ""privacy"" of course you mean ""hope that it can carry illegal payments without law enforcement being able to detect them"".  

Sorry to spoil your fun, but there are ways that law enforcement can detect payments through specific channels, by trying to route ""probe"" payments through it.  Then the gubming thugs can use timing analysis to match source and destination of a multipath payment.

And, if one day they implement a path finding service that scales, the servers involved in that service will know about payments attempted.

&gt; its early beta

NO, IT IS NOT ""BETA""!  It is not even ""alpha"".  Not even a ""prototype"" or a ""proof of concept"".

Namely, a mock-up that still lacks **essential** features, and only lets people get a feeling about  the non-essential ones.   

&gt; Did you ever work in the industry or are just stuck in academia?

When you spout the negative shit, those who are libertarian roll there eyes in there head. I would of been a fan of bch a long time ago if it wasn't for all the negativity. It literally kept me away until I looked for myself.

Now, I always look at things for myself. But literally all the negativity made me wait to look, almost to skip right over it. Your messaging would reach lots more people if you cut the attacks on other crypto",1526617044
"Excellent break down.

This is exactly why i said fuck POLY. It released at like 300m market cap for the tiny supply actually circulating.  The fact that soooo much POLY is held behind closed doors from the team and their rich friends is an immediate red flag and no deal. They'll be slowly selling off tokens consistently, bloating the supply, and deflating the price over the course of this coins history.

It would seriously take them bringing a metric fuck tonne of securities to market to make this coin have any sort of value, and even then, its stupid risky. To accomplish what they're claiming is going to be one of the hardest things in the crypto space. Securities are no fucking joke",1526617017

"&gt; Why ppl here are happy that VEN falls

Because I **VEN is a China Hustle Scam**

Just listen to Sunny Lieu talk.  Absolute scammy meaningless babble:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsI_RQLX884&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=22689

Supporters will say DNV GL has invested in VeChain please refer to:

&gt; Why ‚ÄòThe China Hustle‚Äô is a finance documentary all U.S. investors need to see

And Wall Street companies and investment firms despite due dilligence were scammed into investing in fake Chinese companies for years

&gt; Chinese companies claimed were completely fabricated. eventual downfalls even as they provided evidence of the fraud, specifically video footage of rundown factories with little activity pretending to be massive conglomerates. The contrast between their claims and what they actually produced‚Äîas seen in Rothstein‚Äôs documentary‚Äîwas staggering.

 I am not saying all Chinese cryptos are scams but  the fact is **with crypto we have nothing to go by except technical merit**. At least if you look at Zilliqa (which I am not invested in) which has a Chinese CEO and quite a few Chinese developers have some very technical detail in their interviews and collaborate with Vitalik, Poon, etc.  

VeChain on the other hand provides nothing.  You have Sunny Lieu who provides zero technical detail that he knows what he's talking about.  They have not released anything publicly, have no whitepaper but claim they are :

- Ethereum 2.0.  
- they do supply chain better than anybody
- they also do smart contracts
- they do private data and secret contracts like Enigma
- they will handle IOT like Iota

Until then btc's electricity usage will set all kinds of records as far as energy consumption by computing goes.

and you imply that he:

However it is trivial to look at his submission history and see that:
In the last 25 posts he has submitted only 1 is a direct link to bitcoin.com and only 3 of those 25 mention bitcoin.com.

I do not think that qualifies as constantly or almost exclusively at all. 
You can go ahead and try to count the stats for the entire year if you like. 
If you want to argue that Roger should not be allowed to link to bitcoin.com at all.. I would disagree. But even so it would have very little impact on his total amount of posting.

"White paper name was: ‚ÄúBitcoin: Peer-to-peer Electronic Cash System‚Äù

In his online posts, he described it as property that can be swapped between two parties without a third party. Cash in his eyes actually represented access to something of value.

That‚Äôs a big deal. Its approach and idea were latched on by many early people who were tired of a flawed system that basically let an elected group of bankers have blank checks without any recourse (bad behavior being rewarded). Unlimited debt. And the ability to create as much currency as necessary so that no reconciliation of said debt was ever necessary. 

Great if you are on top. Terrible if you don‚Äôt have access to first world banking.

Now there is an alternative, non-governmental private money market that takes excess capital out of the fiat markets. A way to capture that excess capital from first world banking policy and  give access to a global market (no matter where you live). The attempt was to democratize finance and provide an alternative to central banking policy (which collapsed in 2008-2009 and was the spark that pushed satoshi to execute on an idea that originated in the 1990s).

Ultimately, Bitcoin gives people a defense against extreme inflationary policies of central banks (see historically low interest rates for example).

"i was studying the charts earlier and noticed since bitcoin was invented it has had 2 parabolic bull markets. 2013 and 2017

in 2013 the bitcoin price run was basically 20 to 1000 or a 5000% increase. in 2017 it was much smaller at 2000% but still very much a run. 2014 also had mt gox go nuclear.  also note at the lowest point in the last bear market bitcoin never even got close to where 2013 started before the run up. the market low was found in spring of 2015 around $220 or 10x higher than the start of 2013 however it was an 80% peak to trough. after this it was an uptrend for years with corrections along the way. we had a MUCH smaller run in 2017 at only 2000% vs 5000% in 2013 and no mt gox blow up. it seems very unlikely to have a repeat as the news is actually really positive and you run into problems with the network in general below 5-6k minimum now. we also have already had a 70% correction with no where near as bad of news and no where near as big of initial run up. an 80% correction would be BTC 4k.  miners will start shutting down due to low profitability around 6k and or difficulty will have to fall....in fact that's already starting. you actually get more coin selling hashing power now than you did at this time last month. many of the dec/jan gpu miners are likely already leaving.Ôªø

the thing i noticed about all modern parabolic moves is they rarely if ever recover quickly. bitcoins massive run in 2013, the nasdaq in 1999. the thing that gets me though. both of those prior examples had real fundamental reasons that brought them down. 2017 really did not. people just sold....well. because lambo and beach house. 

if history repeats 2018 will not rally, it will simply be a consolidation year. weak hands will be shook out. difficulty may even fall on many alt coins. maybe even bitcoin. we may have seen the low at 6k and we may even test 5. going to 4 would be an absolute floor unless we are destined to go to zero. i'm sure a lot of miners would shut down. network traffic would fall. 80-90% of altcoins would die. 
 

my personal feeling is this may be a range bound year. we probably have an absolute floor at 5k and might go there if a hard attempt is made at the last 6k support. we also likely have resistance at 12k that will push back if we move through 10k. 

long term. this is healthy. weak hands are shook out and those of us who stick around will be able to mine easier and accumulate at good prices.

* No one knows the future of any coin.

"Yeah, roger that.

I saw that Newegg was accepting BCH now, so I happily attempted to pay for a purchase with that, only to run into that Bitpay bullshit. Took an hour of digging around, installing wallet, configuring wallet, etc. before I was in a position to execute a transaction that used to take me a hot minute. Once I got it all sorted out, moving my BCH to the Bitpay wallet took all of 5 minutes to confirm.

Back when Bitcoin was jammed up last it took me a week to get a confirmation on a move that had me paying some 300 sat/b. Looks like we're heading there again with them. As I said about 10 seconds before I got kick/banned from /r/bitcoin, BTC is no longer practical as a means of commerce if it's subjected to the type of attack that flooded the mempool with 1500 sat/b transactions.",1526609357

Perhaps the good news is that interoperability is on the rise, so even if you support a project without mass appeal you can still store your funds that way and use it as easily (in theory) as a major coin. 

While I'm no fan of Dimon, I do know he was correct when he said the government will always want to know how the money flows.

"Agree.

BCH was fun for a while. It fulfilled a role in the contentious fork with BTC. It made the war fun.

It was already the second ticket this branch of Bitcoin would be known for, along BCC briefly

Maybe we have the power to change the ticker to something less NSFW than BCH. Maybe BIT will be the next.

We have the oportunnity to give new life, and to better reflect what this technology is really about,. 

The existance of this fork already demonstrates that the ticket is not the most important thing, but the idea behind. We can change the ticker if that's what we want.

And we should think about how to better express the Bitcoin idea, not only in the software part, but in every possible way.

There's a world out there. I don't want to carry the BCH ticker any longer if there's a better option. Now will be easier than ever.

The Bitcoin idea describes a neutral, universal, useful, simple enough, solid system for implementing electronic cash. Which is the best invention ever since the internet.

Bitcoin can also be provoking, irreverent, fun, but those are not the primary directives.

That's why I liked the BCH ticket and it's similitude with the word 'bitch'. But we must be able to recognize that utility comes first. And that should ideally be reflected in the ticker too.

BIT is perfect for new people using Bitcoin (cash). Intuitive, coherent, uncomplicated, simple.

It can also make BTC ticker look less BITcoiny. That's good too.

BIT can give this fork new wings and many memes. Like e.g.:

BCH &gt; BitCH &gt; BIT

"I don't know if this is supposed to be some kind of ""gotcha"" smartass comment so I'll reserve my full response. The thing with crypto is, while we don't need permission technically speaking, we still have to interface with an existing society, laws and integration limitations. For crypto to be truly useful and adopted by masses it can't be taxed purely as securities. We have a chicken and egg sort of problem where on one hand we have people who want to hodl for profits, and on the other hand we want mass adoption. We have different camps of people - some who care about profits and others who truly want crypto currency as a currency because we are tired of the banking cartels. Of course then there's that whole issue of who is controlling crypto and sadly to say at the moment it's not your average person. Big money has moved in and bigger money is coming - by the time it's all done and settled we'll have a massive transfer of money from the poor to the rich once more - not the other way around.

"I think this breaks down to a pedantic discussion: basically, can signalling be taken to mean anything at all? Taken to the extreme, only the act of adding another block literally means anything in the white paper consensus scheme, but this would mean all efforts at governance are essentially worthless. I contend that it's a more useful position to think signalling does serve a purpose, but extreme examples such as SegWit2x's ""SegWit now, but pinky-swear I'll deliver ""2x"" much later"" represent a fool's errand.  

Still, I don't think it can be disputed that locking in a consensus agreement and then betraying that same agreement violates the *spirit* of Nakamoto Consensus at the very least, particularly in the arena where it interacts with decentralized human governance attempts.  

In any case, BCH has never violated Nakamoto Consensus, even in spirit, and so can make a strong claim that it is the sole remaining *valid* block chain per the white paper's Sybil-resistant consensus mechanism.  

Miners are free to pour more hash rate into BTC, but that block chain has already established itself as one willing to violate Nakamoto Consensus and thus render itself invalid.",1526605440

""A) I sold BTC and BCC from December 2017 to February 2018 with the cooperation

Following consultation with cryptocurrency experts, I sold BTC and BCC, not by an

affecting the market price, while ensuring the security of the transaction to the extent
possible. The method of sale of BTC and BCC was approved by the court as well.
I would like to refrain from explaining the details of the method of sale; otherwise the
future sale of BTC and BCC could be hindered. However, at present, nothing has
been determined regarding the sale of BTC and BCC in the future.
Please note that the transfers of BTC and BCC from BTC/BCC addresses that I
manage to other addresses do not itself necessarily mean that I sold BTC and BCC at
the time of such transfers. Please retrain from analyzing the correlation between the
sale of BTC and BCC by us and the market prices of BTC and BCC based on the
assumption that the sale was made at the time the BTC and BCC were transferred
from BTC/BCC addresses that I manage, as such assumption is incorrect. """,1526605229

I tend to agree, ICO dumping ETH or BTC can have a pretty big effect on the market. 


There are around 1600 cryptocurrencies right now on CMC, more if you count projects not yet listed there. Many of these are scams or straight up pie-in-the-sky projects that won't see the light of day - but the BTC and ETH used to ""buy in"" to these projects most certainly will see light - on exchanges when the organizers of these projects eventually dump on the market.


People are afraid of Kobayashi moving BTC out of the Mt Gox trustee wallets, but no one really stops to think about how much money is injected into ICOs that basically just plan on exit scamming or doing nothing.


Further to this, many ICOs are extremely opaque. Have you heard this line before, ""It's a Chinese crypto, so their marketing is non-existent right now, which is why you won't find any info on the founders, or a website, but once the marketing kicks in this thing will moon..."" etc


I'm not sure if I've mentioned it here before, but people here should check out [The China Hustle] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7215388/). A lot of what is discussed and investigated in this doco has some parallels in the ICO game (particularly where Chinese projects are concerned)",1526602160

As someone who has *watched BTC* go from $.0001 to $20k but decided against buying it because it was hard or I didn't trust the wallet etc etc I don't think *the markets are in the tank*. 

Last year was insane - the fact that BTC has maintained 40% of it's all-time high instead of 10% like the typical spike and splat trend shows me that this market is more solidified than I thought.

I truly believed that when it went from $1,000 - $1,500 it was overpriced and would come back down to the $1,100 range again and that was when I would buy.

Here I am waiting 15 months later or whatever it's been. 

Now for those of you that thought *any shitcoin* was going to make you rich, you've got a shot - similar to buying lottery tickets but there is a reason your momma taught you if its' too good to be true...and *there are no get rich quick schemes* unless you get in early and get out on top. 

Don't be down - crypto is here to stay, we are going to see blockchain introduced into all sorts of commercial and industrial applications and so if you bought early you're in good shape. If you bought at $20k expecting $100k sorry but you've still got a shot.

"**Gas flare**

A gas flare, alternatively known as a flare stack, is a gas combustion device used in industrial plants such as petroleum refineries, chemical plants, natural gas processing plants as well as at oil or gas production sites having oil wells, gas wells, offshore oil and gas rigs and landfills.



In industrial plants, flare stacks are primarily used for burning off flammable gas released by pressure relief valves during unplanned over-pressuring of plant equipment. During plant or partial plant startups and shutdowns, flare stacks are also often used for the planned combustion of gases over relatively short periods.

Gas flaring at many oil and gas production sites protects against the dangers of over-pressuring industrial plant equipment.

"In the long term halvings will support higher prices without the need to increase the energy demand for mining. Also Bitcoin network energy consumption is tiny compared to the energy wasted in other industries. E.g. gas flaring (just burning because there is no use for it) in the oil industry wastes 30-times the energy compared to the energy to run the Bitcoin network. And not to talk about the carbon footprint of gas flaring. If the wasted natural gas was used at with a efficiency conversion of 33%, the electricity could drive 10-times the hash rate we have now, theoretically supporting 10-times today's price.

We will educate and make sure every shop has a trusted person around that is good with computer. Since Bitcoin Cash works over sms, even in very poor countries if both the merchants and the customers have dumb phones ... it can work.

"Soupernerd has always regretted handing over the sub to Roger Ver instead of Eric Voorhees. I use to agree a bit with that but now I think Roger Ver was the better option. And so far I find that this places is moderated pretty okay. 

It's getting to look like /r/bitcoin 2013 more and more. But with more people in the world that know about it. It's a mix between people from all over every spectrum. /r/bitcoin in 2013 was way to technical and theoretical.

Now users can interact with a whole bunch of software and services. Which makes all the difference in the world for building a balanced community where everybody can find their place. 

So yeah, the sub works great. I am enjoying it. It's slowly growing bigger. It has it's regular users that people recognise. Gavin and Mike pop in once in a while. Big names in Bitcoin like Mark Karpelles will have AMA's here and on /r/bitcoin. 

I think the sub is doing great. Just wait untill after a big market crash. /r/cryptocurrency and /r/bitcoin will become a ghost town after being a please-don't-kill-yourself town for half a year.

/r/ethereum is not showing many posts about usefull stuff and adoption. Their success is depended on Bitcoin Cash becoming the currency of the world. Then they offer extended smart contract functionality that is to risky for the Bitcoin Cash network.

"Bitcoin will continue to exist as both a store of value and as a medium of exchange. 

With cash, we can spend it or keep it in the bank. 

With Bitcoin, we have SegWit and Lightning Network which helps it act as an fast and cheap medium of exchange. And we have cold wallet storage for those who want to save/hodl for the long term. 

Things like Tether exist to act as a bridge between crypto and fiat. As cryptos gain in adoption, there will be less reliance on fiat. What I personally believe is that a lot of altcoins will die out since multilayer and sidechain upgrades are possible with bitcoin. For example, with Rootstock, developers can attach their ETH tokens and DApps to work with BTC as a sidechain. Imagine what that‚Äôll do to the value when BTC has the functionality AND security of the defunct altcoins. ",1526598629

Hashpower decentralization is not only proportional to price. I already touched on this when mentioning the increased orphan rates that will occur as the block size increases. And correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't covert asic boost still possible on BCH?

BCH can't handle massive adoption yet and neither can bitcoin. Anyone who understands how this works knows that you can't use a linear scaling solution (blocksize increase) to provide for an exponential number of new users. BCH will need second layer just like bitcoin unless they plan to go to gigablocks and beyond, and that would be...centralizing.

FWIW, I am a person who likes to run their own full node. To me it is stupid to interact with a trustless network in a way that requires trust.

granted, yes there are a bunch of newbs who aren't responsible with their own passwords and keys. that's why there needs to be more education on this matter. the thought behind bitcoin and security is that if you really care about your wealth, and don't want to trust an authority figure (like a government, bank) because of legitimate fears of corrupt confiscation or criminal theft, then its on you to take the extra steps to secure your BTC funds.

and that is also what justifies the price. the network itself has already put in the work and energy to establish a network that is virtually hacker-proof where no amount of brute force hacking is realistically possible anymore to hack into wallets. a 51% attack gets less likelier every day as more miners join the network.

"Thank you for re-formatting your comment.


In order to mine bitcoins, it is necessary to have:
 - A mining computer (CPU/GPU/specialized ASIC)
 - A power source
 - Access to the internet.

From those three things, the access to the internet is the cheapest, so I'm just going to ignore it and talk about the other two.

**""*A mining computer (CPU/GPU/specialized ASIC)*""**

Currently, specialized ASICs are being used to mine bitcoins. They are specifically implemented to do one and one thing only. To hash bitcoin blocks in order to validate a block with a specific nounce, resulting in a block with the number of zeros required by the difficulty algorithm.

Since implementing this process in a processing pipeline is easy, the only challenge is to find a way to have the maximum amount of processing pipelines in the smallest amount of space and to make it consume the least amount of energy.

**Currently, Bitmain S9 antminer uses 16nm FinFET  fabric chips, implemented at TSMC and consumes 1340W and is capable of outputting 14TH/s.**

Building such rig, consumes resources. Yes, it also produces jobs, but the amount of those is so low, we can despise them. **The important here is the earth resources (precious metals +  energy)**.

In the last year, the [**Bitcoin network hashrate went from 4EH/s to 30EH/s.**](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-hashrate.html#1y). That's not doubling the hashrate, that's an increase of over 7 times! 

Current chipset technology is no longer following the *""Moore's Law""*. Intel as stretched the transistor doubling of the CPUs from two years to three years. **The point is, the technology advancement is not keeping up the pace with the hashing demand of the bitcoin network.**

**Why does this matter?**

In order for a miner to keep profiting, it needs to keep adding more hashrate to his mining structure. By design, Bitcoin mining output is (in average) deterministic. A Fixed amount of new blocks (again, in average) is mined every day. That fixed amount of blocks is (in average) distributed through out the miners [according to their hashrate contribution to the network](https://blockchain.info/pools). **The more hashrate a miner hash, the more blocks he will (in average) mine.** I say in average because, since **the mining process is not deterministic**. But the more hashrate a miner has, the more likely is for it to find a valid block.

**So, if the Fabric process of these specialized ASICs is not capable of accompany the network hashrate demands, by outputting more hashes per second using the same power consumption, then a miner only has one way out to increase its network hashrate, and that is to add more mining rigs.**

Adding more rigs requires more available energy, which comes to my second item on the list. Available Energy.

**""*A power source*""**

Depending on the geographical location, electricity will have different costs. This happens because of the way the energy is produced in that specific location, and depending on the stability of such power sources.

Bitmain for example, became known from creating the first bitcoin mining farms with a large size, in China. This happened because **Coal sourced energy in China is very cheap, but has the inconvenient of producing a large amount of pollution**.
Coal based energy, like the name suggests, requires Coal. Coal is a finite natural resource. 

Bitcoin miners who want to create their own mining farms, are always looking around the world for locations where the energy is cheap. Because of that, mining farms were opened in Iceland, Canada and other places where there's available energy. But this doesn't mean it is a good thing.

For example, [in Plattsburgh, NY,](https://www.pymnts.com/blockchain/bitcoin/2018/plattsburgh-temporarily-halts-bitcoin-mining-raises-electricity-costs/) bitcoin mining was suspended *""because of bitcoin mining, it has already exceeded the allotted amount of hydropower in December and January""*, so the locals decided to halt such operations.

You see, because energy was diverted from its regular use, from powering houses and the industry, to powering mining farms, the energy costs were soaring to the locals **(*""Some residents have complained that their electricity bills have increased by as much as $300, noted the report. ""*)**.

Because energy was now being diverted to bitcoin mining, it cost increased to the locals. One could argue that **""*Oh! But because the energy cost is increasing, the magical entrepreneurs will come down and build new power plants because is such a profitable environment!*""**

No they won't... It takes years to build a power plant and it is not always possible, specially for renewable energy sources, which have specific geographical demands. And building nuclear power plants is out of the question in most democratic governed countries, due to its bad publicity. 


**Now, going back to my point of the energy being wasted.**

You said well. Bitcoin mining by design consumes lots of energy and that is the way to keep the network secure.

But the problem with this design is that the network hashrate is not being increased to maintain the network secure. It is increased so that a miner can increase their profits, as a consequence of the difficulty increase, which is the answer of the difficulty algorithm to the increase of the network hashrate.

While the network hashrate increases, so does the power demand, due to the technological limits which is incapable of responding to the demand.
**At current pace, the network hashrate is increasing exponentially and with it, the energy consumption**.

The increase in the hashrate is the natural answer to the difficulty increase, because miners will need to process many more hashes in order to find a valid block. **Processing Bitcoin blocks is very power-demanding, because there is no other way than through the Brute-Force way to do it.**

When a mining rig process a block and sees it is invalid, it discards it. **Invalid blocks have no use! They cannot be used to record transactions. They cannot be used for anything**. So in simple terms, from the miner perspective, it was wasted time and energy.
Add the energy and resources costs to build the rigs, along with the increase in energy costs to the local population, and you have an energy crises.

**The Lightning Network is the answer to the energy crises?**

No it is not. The LN will not make a dent to it.

Why? Because the Lightning Network is used only to transfer coins from one client to the other, using an near-to-instant process. **It is not used for mining and the problem is the mining energy consumption!** The LN solves the transaction delay issue, but it does not solve the energy issue.

In my opinion, the only way to help the energy issue, is to find a way to recycle invalid blocks and use them just to record transactions, although I don't see how that is possible.

So, recapitulating:

-&gt; The problem is the energy consumption by Bitcoin mining, which is the primary source of profit for a miner.

-&gt; The Bitcoin  network hashrate demand is increasing exponentially.

-&gt; Increasing the network hashrate directly increases the energy and natural resources consumption.

-&gt; Cheap energy source locations are few in the world, which will create a social problems.



I hope this helps for you to understand my point of view.

The same cannot be said with crypto. Some alts can move by huge amounts (compared to a traditional stock) just from a couple of traders dumping or pumping (because of lower volumes). So it‚Äôs much harder to truly know the reason behind why something is the way it is.


Whats the market cap now? 300b? That‚Äôs actually not much, and pretty easy for 100 or so old-school/early adopters to basically wreak havoc with as they trade with each other.


Thats why you see so much discussion on certain discord channels about what some of the bigger players (for example ‚ÄúAngelo‚Äù) are doing - and what ends up here as ‚Äúwhales‚Äù being used to explain and excuse every dump.


I know it‚Äôs not what you want to hear, and we all want solid reasons and explanation for why things are the way they are (which is basically in our nature as humans - making sense of the world around us) but the most likely truth here is the market is still too small and as a result is less resistant to volatility.

". Exchanges can still block your account if you fail to comply with KYC, but the problem becomes worse when they can easily lookup known blacklisted addresses. Indeed similar to how banks operate.

Addresses are single use. Blacklisting addresses only works if the person owning them has released his master public seed and doesn't care enough to make a new one.

&gt; This in practice makes USD fungible (or rather mostly fungible, which Bitcoin is as well).

This is only true by your definition. I agree there is a problem here but it isn't a lack of fungibility but transparency. Withdrawing the USD then redepositing (like coin mixing) would prevent this, thus maintain fungibility.

&gt; I think that's the key friction between us: Bitcoin is indeed somewhat fungible just as USD both physical and digital, but not perfectly so. You say it won't be a problem and I say it will be.

No, the friction is a semantic disagreement. I would say I'm more optimistic about your concerns then you are, but I agree there are privacy issues that need addressing. Our disagreement is whether or not this issue is called fungibility. I am saying this issue is not called fungibility.

&gt; You're right the problems aren't very prominent. But they show cracks in the system which I only see becomes larger.

It could go either way. I'm more optimistic

I would like better privacy but I do not see any good privacy coins out there. None of them, including monero, are any good. Monero is far too centralized and lacks good cold storage wallets. The wallet could be fixed, but the centralization is no good.",1526593351

IF my address is ever compromised, its my own fault...but even then, i never have to worry about my sensitive info... like SS and license... to get out there because it was never put in my BTC wallet address to begin with.

It's so we only have to do this now, and maybe sometime way in the future.

The millibit route we will have to do it now, again in 2-5 years, then sometime in the future.

Not going through this again while we're right in the middle of the adoption phase is a major positive.

Besides, Bits emphasize the true nature of Bitcoin to be used for internet commerce, usually involving, as Satoshi said, ""the top of the micropayment range""

&gt;Bitcoin isn't currently practical for very small micropayments.  Not for things like pay per search or per page view without an aggregating mechanism, not things needing to pay less than 0.01.  The dust spam limit is a first try at intentionally trying to prevent overly small micropayments like that.

&gt;**Bitcoin is practical for smaller transactions than are practical with existing payment methods.  Small enough to include what you might call the top of the micropayment range.**  But it doesn't claim to be practical for arbitrarily small micropayments.

When he said this, 0.01 BTC was worth $0.0006, which would be about 50 Satoshis at the current BCH price.

But then the next day he added:

&gt;Forgot to add the good part about micropayments.  While I don't think Bitcoin is practical for smaller micropayments right now, it will eventually be as storage and bandwidth costs continue to fall.  If Bitcoin catches on on a big scale, it may already be the case by that time.  Another way they can become more practical is if I implement client-only mode and the number of network nodes consolidates into a smaller number of professional server farms.  **Whatever size micropayments you need will eventually be practical.**  I think in 5 or 10 years, the bandwidth and storage will seem trivial.

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=287.msg7687#msg7687

Then someone suggested testing the network by flooding transactions, to which he said:

&gt;It would be nice to keep the blk*.dat files small as long as we can.

&gt;**The eventual solution will be to not care how big it gets.**

&gt;But for now, while it's still small, it's nice to keep it small so new users can get going faster.  **When I eventually implement client-only mode, that won't matter much anymore.**

This matches what was said in the white paper, once there is SPV wallets and *proper* block pruning (not the half-assed Core solution) are available, it should never be a problem.

Say in a year BCH grows like BTC did last year, to $20K, that $0.10 is now expressed as 0.005 mBCH, or 5 bits.

There was a while where many people I know in China had a ""fever"" to buy gold.  Then it was Bitcoin in more recent years.

If you take a step back and look at what drives the global economy, it's really business and real-estate.  So while you're correct that a stock is not currency and that Coke did well where some others did not, ""on average"" I suspect if you were careful with investing during that period of time, you could have earned the same or more money.

It is interesting to note, though, that gold tends to not lose value (even gaining value) when business slumps.  We saw that with the Great Depression and the ""Great Recession"", though I still think China was the bigger influence in the latter.",1526591300

"I don't know \-\-\- I've thought about it and if you had to ""cash out"" using bitcoin to buy real estate is not a bad way to go.

Seems like if you sell your bitcoin at Coinbase and do a wire transfer to a bank like Bank of America, you are pretty much risking getting the funds frozen and inaccessible. Maybe a lawsuit would open them, but ... doubtful? 

They would come up with some AML\\KYC reason why they think your wire is suspicious and if you did things like send $8000 a month \(a reasonable replacement for my salary if I lost my job\), they might think that's structuring.  

If you send it as one big wire, they might seize it, and you're even more in the hole.

If you really can buy real estate with bitcoin, then the sky's the limit. Yes, los Federales could seize the property, or IRS could I guess, but you could have your day in court at least, have some kind of appeal.

You'd have to type a helluva more zeros if the base unit was BIT instead of BCH, isn't it?

My argument is that this more of GUI design problem than anything else. Bitcoin ABC allows the user to chose in which unit/subunit amounts are displayed (BCH, mBCH, bits). That's the correct way to go about it, not change which base unit Bitcoin Cash uses.

I have an engineering degree in electronics, so we juggled with ampere, milliampere, microampere, volt, kilovolt, millivolt, microvolt, watt, milliwatt, kilowatt, microfarad, nanofarad, picofarad, kilohom, megohm, etc.

Imagine if each super/subunit had its own name depending on the nature of the quantity measured, that would be a nightmare.

"&gt;Because you assume price of VeChain will rise, regardless of how much dividend you get. 

That's one of the stupidest things I've ever heard. The whole reason for buying VET is to acquire THOR through staking. If THOR has poor demand, VET holders get very little, which they dump their bags and drop the price. Jesus christ man. This is one big problem in crytpo. People like you who have no basic understanding of financial markets spouting ignorant shit. NOBODY who holds VEN wants THOR to be low priced. That's the fucking point dummy.

&gt;Then ask yourself why other people invest in 99% of other altcoins that give no staking dividend?

First of all, it's not a dividend. THOR is a product which people buy to use the Vechain system. Secondly, other tokens have other use cases. They're not the same as VET-THOR. They have other factors that influence their price. 

&gt;Because they expect the value of that altcoin to rise over time. 

Because more people start using the system. People holding ETH are betting on corps using the system. People betting on BTC are betting on mass adoption. You don't seem to understand that a very weak THOR price means no one is using the Vechain system. That's fucking bad.

&gt;Same shit here, sherlock. No one fucking cares if THOR price is value of a napkin if VEN price skyrockets.

You seem to be living in an alternate reality. Do you even understand that VEN goes away soon? It turns to VET. If I buy VET at $5 a token and I get pennies for that, I'm going to dump it for another financial product. That dump creates price pressure downward. No one is going to hold VET while there is no demand for THOR.

&gt;I'm fucking losing IQ talking to a complete moron like you.

Honestly at this point, I just feel sorry for you. People who hold way more VEN than you responded very positively to my post. Indeed, I think the sales of THOR could be very good, and justify the price. The whole point of my post was that VEN is *approaching* overvaluation. Which has been so far, proven to be true. The price then is very similar to the price now, almost exactly. 

If you can't understand basic risk and supply/demand, I don't think you should be in this space, and I certainly don't think you should be opening your mouth telling people ""how it is"". Now, go back to your little telegram Chinacrypto.info and go suck stockon_slaps dick.

I‚Äôll give you unfounded reasons why we‚Äôre close to a Bull Run!  Is your coin tanking?  I‚Äôll remind you how good the team is, how gamechanging it is and reinforce your belief that the coin is actually severely undervalued!  Anything you need me to say to make you feel better, I promise I will be there.  ",1526589220

"Bitcoin does not care what is built on top of it, all that is cares is it is being used

anyone would be Bullish about **any** continued investment in Bitcoin

The **real** question is what type of investments are being made in the Bitcoin BTC chain that has zero room for growth compared to the upgraded Bitcoin BCH chain that can already handle significantly more transactions in addition to restoring original functionality that was removed from Bitcoin by core",1526589124

"&gt; I think we can and will see bitcoin at something more realistic though, like 50-70K ATH by the end of this year. 

Predicting an investment to grow 500-700% by the end of the year is also quite unrealistic. We should all be happy if it gets back to 10k. That's still 20% over the current price which is much more than most investments pay in a year.",1526588951

It‚Äôs tricky tho because btc don‚Äôt need that now as it‚Äôs a store of value so it would pick the market back up as whales pamp it. Tough to say in the short term.

Are we sure /r/bitcoin doesn't naturally want to become a Bitcoin Cash subreddit?",1526588600

Some people from /r/bitcoin has infiltrated but the community is bullish on your proposal. Let's make history!,1526588545
It kills the Bitcoin Cash brand less than a year after its creation. Not sure how that is a positive at this point.,1526588523
"A lot of big stock exhcnge are lauching crypto trading platform, this is pretty good for this world!!",1526588519
"The desire to holding for future price increases is the buying pressure.

That can last for decades and generations, but it only lasts for as long as there are hoarders and a general belief that the amount of hoarders will be sustained or grow and for as long as Bitcoin is the asset of choice.

People actually using Bitcoin can increase it in the public consciousness, but the price will only go up if that translates into more hoarders and long term holders.

Spend and Replace is a sort of hybrid between buying/selling and holding, it lets users keep the Bitcoin they hoard in addition to them using it as a currency. Spending and Replacing is not generally understood to mean, ""spend all your Bitcoin then buy some more Bitcoin and spend that"" because even if it is just subconscious, it is that widespread desire for hoarding is desirable for the stability growth of the currency.",1526588482

"&gt; the opposition using it as an opportunity to change our name like they did with bcash

Nope I never suggested that. I am of the mindset that crypto should be available to use by all including the poor.  I disagree with your original statement about giving tax cuts to the rich. ,1526588359
"It does a bit but will take time to update since it's not happening on an exchange. The real reason OTC's haven't seen much movement is because the quantites have been fairly low so far (besides the Mt Gox thing).


Even the futures contract, I remember I looked it up once and one contract was 500 bitcoin and another was like 2000...500 is nothing. 2000 I can see some slight movement but Mt Gox dumped 16,000 bitcoin just to give you a scope.

Also futures contract depends on the price when contract negotiated. If during the time of contract about to end, and market price of bitcoin is 10,000 while they agreed to buy at 9,000, I don't think they would dump the market. It's only if the contract is to be fulfilled at a price higher than the market price so you have to look closely instead of just blindly saying FUTURES EXPIRE! Some are long, some are short.

"Your analysis absolutely does not follow it's dictates exactly because the whit paper does not dictate validity in any way. The closest it comes is mentioning it in conjunction with the creation of value via double spends. BCH was a fork from Bitcoin that had a minority hash support. It was a departure from the main chain that occurred without consensus. The EDA never went through the voting process, it never reached any sort of consensus, it was just implemented by the developer that initiated the hard fork. Must be convenient to have that gaslighting link in your back pocket to thwart any dissenting opinions though. ",1526588243
"The study won't load for me. But I'm sure it is one of those bitcoin mining studies, that doesn't eve have a clue how mining works.

Also, Marc Bevand is wrong, chip energy improvements will not make bitcoin mining to use less power. If hardware is more energy efficient, Miners will just install more. I don't get how 'bitcoin entrepreneur' doesn't get this. 

Most of the studies that I read, also forget that mining follows the price of coin. Energy consumption won't be 3 times more at years end, unless price goes up 3x. And all of the studies I read, completely forgot block subsidy halvings. In 2028, price of bitcoin can be $80,000, and energy consumption will be same as today.",1526588230
"Bitcoin Cash's whole selling point and reason for it's current valuation is  ""We are like Bitcoin, but better."" The BCH community must continuously put down Bitcoin in order to reinforce this one and only selling point. ",1526588219
"I remember a year ago people were happy to share about Sia trying new stuff (and storj) with decentralized storage, Bitcoin talking about the 2MB Segwit with everyone giving their opinion, majority caring about the votes on it, a lot of memes, a lot of newcomers questions answered and not just with comments trying to shill the new dirusptive coin, new findings, conferences and all.

It wasn‚Äôt perfect but it felt balanced. Today it‚Äôs all about how to make the global market cap rise, no original meme, talking about institutional money all day long, how we have to unite and believe in a bull year, etc. It just doesn‚Äôt feel the same.

I feel like the mindset was better when people treated cryptos as the crazy thing trying to change the money-game where you can get filthy rich rather than a fucking random investment that you hold and hope for it to rise.

I get that everything changes but it feels tame now. It‚Äôs a depressing sub.

"The only thing that can really determine that is time tbh. Not saying I agree with him, but if crypto ended tomorrow, most of us would be late. However, if it lasts for hundreds of years, then we would be early. ",1526588012
"I think its funny that in that link the global debt dwarfs the global money supply.  More money is owed than there is money.  Fractional reserve banking for you right there.  

Not related to crypto, but the funny thing about money (and this would apply to pooling your money in a place that protects your cryptocurrency too), is that its all the numbers are basically made up.  Its just a representation of wealth ownership, and most people have no real wealth. In fact, they have negative wealth and owe money to someone else, which will force them to have to work forever just to live.  Its like slavery, except with extra steps.",1526587983
"You are not actually supporting your argument that ""support for X coin and not Bitcoin is perpetuating the idea of monetary inflation"".

We have always had the ability to create an infinite number of representations for our currency.  Bitcoin isn't some special snowflake in this, it isn't the first deflationary currency, it isn't even the first digital currency.  It is simply another in a long history of currencies.  So argument that using a currency other than Bitcoin is pro-inflationary is purely a non-sequitur.  The conclusion does not follow from the statement. ",1526587978

or is it only really meant for business that want to use qsp services to run a validation node and then use the earned tokens to pay qsp to audit things?

the biggest criticism i see of qsp is that the idea is good, the token is useless/not needed because it all could be done with either usd/btc for manual audit or with eth for network audit. they accuse the qsp team of creating a token just to raise funds quick.

"**Gaslighting**

Gaslighting is a form of manipulation that seeks to sow seeds of doubt in a targeted individual or in members of a targeted group, hoping to make them question their own memory, perception, and sanity. Using persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, and lying, it attempts to destabilize the target and delegitimize the target's belief.

Instances may range from the denial by an abuser that previous abusive incidents ever occurred up to the staging of bizarre events by the abuser with the intention of disorienting the victim. The term owes its origin to the 1938 Patrick Hamilton play Gas Light and its 1940 and 1944 film adaptations.

"""As long as they have a good product"". Name me one project in the crypto space that actually has a product and is in the top 15. You actually don't need to, the answer is none.

Marketing is not done to attract newcomers. When was the last time you sat in a movie theater and saw some bullshit promo for a shitcoin?

OK, responding directly to your shoe example. Nike and Adidas are shit. They are garbage. They are known in the industry for throwing money and marketing and not focusing on making a good product. Asics is superior and is recommended by every professional in the fitness industry. Every. Single. One. I promise you. They spend no money on marketing. You can tell by how up to date and aware someone is in the fitness industry by the brand of their shoe. Idiots buy Adidas and Nikes. 

As far as thriving no matter how good or bad their tech is because they spend money on marketing, I absolutely agree with you. Thats the problem though. More money is being funneled into shitty projects because shitty projects understand the power of marketing. Good projects don't market and spend their time building a product, and because of that their valuations are low. 

Marketing is killing crypto, and if you think otherwise you are ignoring all of the facts in the space. I can name a hundred shitcoins overvalued and I can name a hundred great coins undervalued. 

Marketing TO NON CRYPTO people will boost the marketcap. Do you notice how all the marketing is done in house? Marketing isn't successful on people not in crypto, because they aren't completely retarded. You can't market a shit ICO to a reasonably intelligent person, but you can market it to an idiot pleb throwing money at crypto.

It's more than terminology, it's the definition of the Bitcoin system.

In the email context, ‚Äúspam‚Äù refers to the fact that it‚Äôs extremely cheap for an email sender to send out a huge number of unwanted emails that, at least collectively, impose a non-trivial cost on the recipients (in the form of wasted time and attention). You can use an email service that attempts to filter out emails that are likely unwanted, but this is inherently tricky given that the costs of a false positive can be high (you miss an important email) and the fact that spammers can evolve their techniques in a deliberate attempt to circumvent spam filters. There isn‚Äôt really an analog for this problem in crypto. I suppose if your wallet were constantly sending you alerts to notify you of random 1-satoshi transactions you‚Äôd received, that might get annoying.

I'm a believer and investor in crypto but this idea that we'll ever see a bull run like 2017 again is still laughable. Crypto is going to take a long time to find its way and there's lots more pain to endure and lots more work to be done, 2017 was a one time blip, the secret is out and the disillusionment from all that speculation is still yet to set in. 

Also, then when the big money finally does arrive (and blockchain is finally doing something tangible/useful to the common man) of course the market will be bigger but very few people are going to make money of it, probably not anyone on this sub anyway. What does it matter if crypto hits $10T and you were an early adopter if its from new coins we've not heard from yet and are not able to buy early? That big money is going to ensure it's the one making all the big gains, that's what's actually going to kill BTC for sure with a new currency that's actually usable and probably something new will supplant ETH as everyone's darling too with a platform that solves all ETHs current problems and real world problems (CryptoKitties is not a problem that needed solving!)

So my message is this to all early adopters: sitting on BTC and ETH right now and thinking you're going to be good simply because you're an early adopter is presumptuous. I mean it's not the worst thing (keeping it in your checking account instead would be worse) but when we are one day at $10T as a market what I'm saying is you're not going to get the return you think you're going to get sitting on BTC and ETH today.

"This a great discussion to have. I like bits more than cash, and I agree with the positive psychological effect of owning more than one bit. However, I think you're taking the psychological analysis one step too far. I disagree that 1 BIT should be valued at 1/1,000,000 Bitcoin Cash. This introduces a countering psychological effect in that anyone even vaguely familiar with the concept of inflation will liken Bitcoin Cash to a hyper\-inflated currency a la Venezuela or Zimbabwe. Those new to the space that are less familiar with bitcoin's deflationary nature could find this off\-putting.

Owning 0.16 bits is better than owning 0.16 Cash or 0.16 Bitcoin Cash. It retains the plural nature. But I would rather own 0.16 bits instead of 160,000 bits. It retains the perception of scarcity. The 1/1,000,000 does the opposite.

I also don't think the ticker needs to change. The unit rarely defines the ticker symbol, and in fact is usually represented by only one letter of the ticker symbol \(""USD"" \-\-\&gt; Dollar , ""GBP"" \-\-\&gt; pound, ""KRW"" \-\-\&gt; South Korean Won\).

If I want to use Bitpays services you say, actually I don't but its the merchants choice dictated to me. |But when  a shop starts telling me what type of hide my wallet should be made from thats ridiculous. Bitpay should empower people not dictate to them. If I can not use Bitpay using my_odd_wallet then Bitpay are disenfranchising me and they are the enemy here. And in fact my wallet isn't odd, its pretty dam canonical, SPV comes after a full node, why shouldn't I use a full node as a wallet?  If its good enough for Satoshi it should be good enough for Bitpay. 

Its a fail because the point about Bitcoin is that if you have an address and make a payment to it, thats Bitcoin 101 .  BIP70 should be a convenience, not mandated. (Just like the bitcoincash address format, its designed to stop people making stupid mistakes, but you can use legacy format if you choose.) .  
Lastly this is an ABC client fail because its supposed to support this as far as I knew although I'm beginning to have my doubts. 

As for you telling me what I have a need to do thats fail too. ""There is no need to be making payments through a full node"".  The answer to that is I should be able to if I choose to.

"&gt;You do have immediate and exclusive control over your funds. This means the funds you didn't spend with the the other side. If we open a channel with 1BTC each, and then I send you .5BTC, I have total control over that .5BTC. And I don't need you to do anything, if I want to close the channel and move the coins away. How is this not having complete control over your funds?

If your channel partner becomes non-cooperative, you will have to wait for time-out period to elapse before gaining full control over your funds.  And you don't have exclusive control over LN funds (in the same manner that you have exclusive control over funds in your own address) because you have to successfully guard against attempted theft.

&gt;If I put 1BTC on a paper wallet and give you the paper wallet, would you call that a ""money substitute""? It's clearly an off-chain tx, but is this anything less than a clear Bitcoin tx? (If you don't trust me with copies of the paper wallet, replace ""paper wallet"" with ""OpenDime""... Google it if you don't know it.) These are perfectly valid Bitcoin txs, they just occur off-chain. There's nothing ""lesser"" or ""fake"" about them.

Yes, those examples are obviously money substitutes. And they obviously don't have the same security and convenience models as the money proper.

&gt;Not sure what you mean with this ""balance""... but LN definitely increases the capacity of money proper

The point is that you can't arbitrarily limit the money proper without well, breaking things.  And no, LN doesn't increase the capacity of money proper because it's not money proper; it doesn't have the same security and convenience guarantees as on-chain transactions as previously explained. Furthermore, if a second-layer network COULD offer the exact same security and convenience as the base blockchain that would represent a dangerous state of affairs as it would undermine the demand for on-chain payments and thus the security of the entire system (which will ultimately depend on on-chain tx fees as the block reward diminishes).

&gt;Again, think about people passing around an OpenDime stick - Potentially infinite txs, at exactly 0 cost, and no impact whatsoever on the blockchain. But it's off-chain, and it's got absolutely nothing to do with ""banking"".

Certainly doesn't allow for infinite txs as the throughput of a system based on physical transfer is *severely* limited by that requirement. And certainly not ""0 cost"" at least for the same reason. In addition, there's the cost of reliably verifying that you're receiving an untampered with / non-counterfeit stick (assuming for the moment that this is even possible), and the costs imposed by the sticks' lack of granularity -- ""your purchase comes to 0.7128 BTC. Do you have an OpenDime stick with that exact balance?"" So yeah, that's definitely a money substitute and in most contexts, a poor and hugely-impractical one.

&gt;Why not? Why is this impossible?

That should be pretty intuitive.  But again, the LN's security model is based on ability to, when needed, have a transaction confirmed on-chain in a timely manner.  That is undermined the more the base is constrained.

&gt;Channel factories (Google it if you're unaware) together with Schnorr can reduce the impact on the blockchain by up to 96%! That's a huge reduction. People like to point to the LN whitepaper and the 133MB block size... with 96% reduction that goes down dramatically. But there's more... As I said above, LN is not the only scaling solution. On it's own, LN will not be enough. Now take Rootstock... right now it can process ~2000 txs/s. And it's live on main net. That relieves the impact on the bitcoin blockchain again. Or Liquid, which OP was all about... that could relieve all the pressure from exchanges and other large players. 

Oh boy, another unproven layer and even more complexity. Again, it all might ""work"" but it doesn't change my more fundamental point (which at least at times, you seem to agree with).

&gt;But to your point, and I think I speak for the entire community that understands the scaling approach more than just on the superficial level, the balance between base layer and higher layers will be established, possibly away from the current restrictions. But it will be established once we have enough meaningful data, not arbitrarily because we think that we'll ""certainly"" need it. In other words, all the possible optimizations first (LN, drivechains, sidechains, Schnorr, MAST, bulletproofs, ...) and only after we start thinking about the block size. 

Well, ultimately the right balance will be established by the market. BTC currently has a still significant (albeit shrinking) network effect advantage over its competitors.  But if it fucks up this ""balance"" we're talking about too egregiously (or, from my perspective, if it *continues* to fuck it up), that will eventually allow it to be surpassed by a competitor that gets the balance closer to correct.

&gt;The most hard core small-blocker is Luke-jr, hope you'll agree. 

No way. I consider *myself* to be the most hard core small-blocker. I'm staunchly opposed to any increase in the BTC block size / weight limit. In fact, I'd like to see at least a 99% reduction. 

&gt; but it's about being extremely conservative and cautious instead of reckless. 

In my view, and as I've written before, the ""conservative"" approach was not to be conservative with respect to Bitcoin's *code* (i.e., by not changing the value of a single constant from a 1 to a 2) -- but rather to have been conservative with respect to Bitcoin's *fundamental mode of operation*. In other words, I think the conservative approach would have involved a modest increase in the block size limit that would have allowed Bitcoin to continue operating in the way it had been operating up until relatively recently (i.e., low fees and fast and reliable confirmations), by allowing blocks to continue to grow at the relatively gradual pace they'd grown at since Bitcoin's inception.

In 2010, debating Gavin Andresen on Bitcointalk, Satoshi argued,

Even Satoshi had stated that it would be a good idea to move the decimal place at some point. Bits is good because it's not too small of a unit, and there's still more room to go smaller in the future when necessary.

1 Bit is pretty close to one-tenth of 1 Japanese Yen right now, when the BCH price gets to $10K 1 Bit would be roughly equivalent to 1 US cent/1 Yen.

With the price at $1,000,000 US = 1 BCH, 1 Bit would be around $1 US, and Satoshis would be equivalent to cents.

With 20% of the world's transactions using it, 1 Bit would be roughly equivalent to the USD in 1900, when it was backed by gold and silver. Which would be about $100 US today. (Inflation is a helluva drug.)

1)	Your first point is scarcely cohesive, and demonstrates that you haven‚Äôt spent enough time reading about Vechain/thor‚Äôs organizational structure. The Vechain Foundation, which is responsible for steering the direction of the project, is nonprofit. There exists a separate private Vechain entity (for building dapps, etc, which is what investors can buy equity in). This is my current understanding, I‚Äôm open to being corrected, of course.


2)	Whitepaper is described as being ~100 pages long, and coming out before early June. Code will be made public in the coming weeks as well. You can say that you don‚Äôt believe these things are true, but we‚Äôll just have to wait a few weeks to see. If the whitepaper and code *do* come out in the next few weeks, are you open to changing your mind?


3)	If companies use it, they will require thor to execute on the blockchain. Thor is produced by staking VEN. Why wouldn‚Äôt a company that needs thor want to generate their own supply (by owning and staking VEN?) They could also just buy thor when they want to use it, which is another option.. but either way, the value of VEN will increase from increased adoption (and thus thor demand)



4)	Sunny Lu does seem like a happy person.. but do you truly think this is a scam? Do you think that PwC and DNV GL are being fooled? Or do you think that they, having much more access to information and auditing capacity than you or I, might actually believe in vechain as a legitimate project?

Let me explain it in laymen terms because clearly the people defending this project have no idea how platforms and tokenomics work. 

Case of Cryptokitties: they were able to create an entire network and peer to peer transactions and exchanges on their network using ETH.

"&gt;Wow lots of information, but none of it shows that the Bitcoin system uses more than the fiat system.

\&gt;That's  because you can't. Both systems are different and the current fiat

\&gt; system is much more complex than the Bitcoin blockchain.

OK so we are in agreement that neither of us can calculate if bitcoin uses more energy than fiat.

&gt;The energy is not ""wasted"".

\&gt; Yes it is. Let me tell you why.

\&gt;Mining bitcoin blocks requires brute\-force solving.

\&gt;**Brute\-force  solving a valid Bitcoin block is non\-deterministic,**

\&gt;**where every invalid  block is wasted energy. Invalid blocks**

\&gt;**cannot be used for transactions  and are useless for the**

\&gt;**blockchain.** That is why hashing  algorithms which focus on

\&gt;security, are developed specifically to cause  the maximum

\&gt;amount of energy waste when solved using brute\-force 

\&gt;techniques. This removes the incentive to try to break the

\&gt;hashing  algorithm using brute\-force attacks.

I'm not sure what your point is. Mining takes energy \*by design.\* The energy is not wasted, but you seem to say that since most hashes are not used then they are wasted. You miss the very essence of POW. An attacker would need to also expend this much energy, and it is unlikely that anyone \(including colluding governments\) can mount such an attack \*and that is by design.\* Your waste is everyone else's security.

How much energy is used? You have pointed to lots of data that shows that energy is consumed. \*We know that. It is by design.\* I have an easier way to know how much energy is used today, and how much will be used in the future \(at least until the coinbase become negligible\). Take the value of the bitcoin that is awarded every 10 minutes \(coinbase transactions currently at 6.25 BTC, plus miners fees offered on a per\-transaction basis\) and convert that money into mining computers and electricity, with a small amount saved for profit. That is exactly how much value will be spent on electricity and computers on average in the long run. If the price of each bitcoin goes to $1M, and someone is getting 6.25 BTC every 10 minutes, then all of the miners, in aggregate, will spend about $6.25M \(minus computer costs and small profit\) on electricity every 10 minutes.

Now that is a lot of power, and at 7 transactions per second the power consumption per transaction is absurdly high \*now.\* But with layer 2 networks such as lightning this number will but cut by a factor of 1M or even higher.

After the coinbase award becomes negligible \(will be zero in 2041\), then the amount of $ spent on electricity will be governed only by the amount that people are willing to offer the miners in fees. The market will correct that number the exact amount that the users \(people paying the fees\) think the resulting security is worth it.

\&gt; Please, read my comment again. After referring my points, I spoke 

\&gt; regarding the security of Bitcoin. Yes, the power guarantees the

\&gt;  integrity of the network. But miners aren't working for the integrity

\&gt; of  the network. They work for the mining profit. 

Please re\-read your above statement. You claim the miner's motive is not network integrity, but profit. Again, \*this is by design.\* If you are proposing a network that is secured by miner's willingness to mine because it helps the network rather than by profit, your network will be less secure than any network on earth. Bitcoin has incentivized the miners to chase profits and to the miners the resulting network security is a side benefit, not what they are aiming for. This is part of Bitcoin's magic: All participants are incentivized to do what is best for the network, and the way to make the most profit \*by design\* is also what is best for the network.",1526581727

"I do get it, just different viewpoints.

I'm not denying that the link isn't true. There's a video, and a guy celebrating some idiotic behaviour (my opinion). It's true.

I think the difference comes from my belief that BCH's current primary goal should be adoption, through technical, economic and social superiority.

There's a greater chance of them joining us if we're celebrating a new payment gateway, supporting a new merchant or politely correcting technical misunderstandings and guiding them through something new, uncharted and exciting. 

The crypto world currently has a PR issue (ICO scams, warring forks, drug trade, money laundering, trade manipulation), and finger pointing doesn't help that...it brings our weaker side to everyone's attention because it's human and emotional and interesting. But it scares people off, and makes them question ""the truth"". An unfortunate side effect? Fear and uncertainty drive volatility. Volatility makes life difficult for merchants, who are the future of our economic technology. It also stings those of us with investments. It's all interconnected, and small changes in behaviour can help improve the fear, uncertainty and anger.

 - People were worried about adding to the confusion in the short term by having different in-use denominations.
 - Eventually, people stopped actually *using* Bitcoin and the issue eventually faded away as if you're not going to use it for commerce, why bother?

"i disagree, as long as they have a good product, they should be marketing the shit out of it. the crypto space is still very new, and until there's 30-40% saturation of ""regular"" consumers, crypto as an industry needs to be pushed as hard as possible. once it is grown and the random person down the street can answer you how a blockchain works, then there should be a big push in how a specific product is actually legitimate.

marketing won't kill crypto, it will bring in newcomers and new money. if you generalize all the profiles of current coins/tokens, they can be applied to any space in any consumer industry.

Let's use sneakers just because its familiar with a lot of people.

1. The handmade mom and pop company in northern maine who has a team of 5 people to create extremely well made leather boots that last a life time. They only have a website up but most of their profit comes from in-store visits from locals

2. Nike/Adidas - most widely famous, quality is pretty good, have their own technology and competent engineers. spend billions on marketing and advertising, endorsements, sponsorships, etc.

3. the lesser known regional brands that are just as good as Nike but are much smaller in scale but they do have a following but have a business model that doesn't scale because they do not have the advertising dollars

4. the knock off brands, the fake Jordan shoes, the Adidos, the ones that sell for $15 and they have no real technology but because people get tricked they still make money as a business

See how the industry and any other consumer product industry will thrive with marketing/advertising no matter how good or bad their technology is?

Marketing will not kill crypto. Instead, marketing from all coins/tokens is a must to continue to grow and legitimize the crypto market and raise the cap. Only after the market grows to whatever mathematically reaches its tipping point, then the next phase is consumers will educate themselves naturally and the actual good products will grown and get what they deserve. But there will always be shit coins and there will always be consumers buying them. 

TL;DR: Marketing/advertising is necessary at this point to further market cap growth and saturate this trading space. The next phase will be consumers inevitably figuring out which products are truly superior and that will happen naturally. Shit coins will never go away because they have a business model that will be successful though morally wrong and borderline illegal.",1526581360

"banks won't allow purchase on CREDIT because it is a threat to their ability to buy crypto on credit and cause massive market pump/dumps.  you can buy with a debit card on some stuff.  

Buying on credit is incredibly risky and should be avoided at all cost.  DO NOT DO IT. ONLY INVEST AN AMOUNT YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE.

It's basically an existential risk to banks... they can't extend credit for something that they have no recourse in recovering.

"Yes, there are buyers and sellers for each transaction, but buying and selling OTC is done to avoid negatively impacting the price.  OTC desks have a spread in order to make a profit, but it doesn't impact the overall price on the exchange/market.  The sales/purchases are not reflected in the price on the exchange.  I've had conversations with OTC desks in the onboarding process and if the amount of capitol they deal with on a daily basis was reflected on the exchanges, BTC would have blown by its ATH months ago.  Imagine what would happen to the price if someone wanted to make a $100MM order of BTC?  It would either go through the roof (market order), or take a really, really long time (staging in), and would still impact the price against the interests of the purchaser.  Same thing with a sell order; price through the floor, or take a really long time to sell.  Add to that the volatility of the market (market could move away from the price the person wants to transact at before they are able to), and it's just bad investment action to not go through OTC, which again, won't impact price... well, unless you're talking traditional markets where the market makers / 'specialists' have the job of managing prices, etc, and they do to an extent in crypto.  And yes, as you know, there's plenty of manipulation in the crypto.

This is the only good reason IMO. People think bitcoin is a coin and physical coins are not divisible. Bit (binary digit) is not divisible either. So, Bitcoin doesn't seem like a divisible thing.

"&gt;Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin unlike the BTC\-Lighting scam so calling it Bitcoin is appropriate. The BTC\-Lightning bunch don't like it and make every effort to change it but that is not our problem, it's theirs. They should not have destroyed BTC and damaged crypto in the first place.

I'm not exactly sure what this has to do with what we are discussing.

&gt;Changing the name when the currency is not even one year old adds to the lack of consistency and stability conveyed by BCH's image. It's just too much and is hurting the currency.

If it doesn't change now *while* we are young, it will never change. By showing that we can make difficult by valuable changes \(just like hardforks\) we show how unified and pragmatic our currency and community are.

&gt;The price does matter in some ways. Changing the token unit to something worth 1 millionth of current price will put BCH into the DGB category make people think BCH is close to worthless.

That doesn't seem to have been a problem for the 1001 shitcoins on the market. People don't see it as worthless, they see it as 'cheap', i.e. a price they can afford.

&gt;Changing the token unit to one millionth will also result in BCH being accused of ""printing money"" as it multiplies the number of tokens by one million \(21 billion instead of 21 million.\) At first sight it is true and people will believe the sockpuppet propaganda.

No, this is not true. Nothing needs to change at all at the protocol layer. In fact the protocol doesn't even recognise the concept of 1BCH = 100,000,000 satoshis. The only denomination that exists at the protocol layer is satoshis, and this doesn't change that at all.

&gt;The question is, when BCH has been so successful at gaining acceptance in the crypto industry and now moves to public adoption also with success in the early stages, why the push to change the name now??

Like I said above, because in this early stage is the only time to make a change like this.

&gt;Why is this a priority for BCF/BU \(these attempts at changing the name always seem to come from this group\) when so much needs to be done?

This isn't a priority of the BCF, this \*a\* priority of me, and one of many.  I am not the BCF. The BCF is working on many different things right now.",1526580744

"&gt; Of course not. Again, there will always be a natural balance between money proper (""the base layer)"" and money substitutes (""second layers""). Satoshi himself doubted that Bitcoin would be suitable for ""very small micropayments."" He did however think that Bitcoin was ""practical for smaller transactions than are practical with existing payment methods. Small enough to include what you might call the top of the micropayment range.""

This is not exactly correct.

&gt;Bitcoin isn't currently practical for very small micropayments.  Not for things like pay per search or per page view without an aggregating mechanism, not things needing to pay less than 0.01.  The dust spam limit is a first try at intentionally trying to prevent overly small micropayments like that.

&gt;Bitcoin is practical for smaller transactions than are practical with existing payment methods.  Small enough to include what you might call the top of the micropayment range.  But it doesn't claim to be practical for arbitrarily small micropayments.

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=287.msg7524#msg7524

But then the next day he added:

&gt;Forgot to add the good part about micropayments.  While I don't think Bitcoin is practical for smaller micropayments right now, it will eventually be as storage and bandwidth costs continue to fall.  If Bitcoin catches on on a big scale, it may already be the case by that time.  Another way they can become more practical is if I implement client-only mode and the number of network nodes consolidates into a smaller number of professional server farms.  **Whatever size micropayments you need will eventually be practical.**  I think in 5 or 10 years, the bandwidth and storage will seem trivial.

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=287.msg7687#msg7687

Then someone suggested testing the network by flooding transactions, to which he said:

&gt;It would be nice to keep the blk*.dat files small as long as we can.

&gt;**The eventual solution will be to not care how big it gets.**

&gt;But for now, while it's still small, it's nice to keep it small so new users can get going faster.  When I eventually implement client-only mode, that won't matter much anymore.

This matches what was said in the white paper, once there is SPV wallets and *proper* block pruning (not the half-assed Core solution) are available, it should never be a problem.

"Loads of reasons. here's some:

- Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin unlike the BTC-Lighting scam so calling it Bitcoin is appropriate. The BTC-Lightning bunch don't like it and make every effort to change it but that is not our problem, it's theirs. They should not have destroyed BTC and damaged crypto in the first place.

- Changing the name when the currency is not even one year old adds to the lack of consistency and stability conveyed by BCH's image. It's just too much and is hurting the currency. 

- Changing the name after less than a year questions the competence of the people maintaining Bitcoin Cash. THe inevitable question is ""Will these people ever make their mind up."" It looks bad and hurts the credibility of BCH and its community.

- The price does matter in some ways. Changing the token unit to something worth 1 millionth of current price will put BCH into the DGB category make people think BCH is close to worthless.

- Changing the token unit to one millionth will also result in BCH being accused of ""printing money"" as it multiplies the number of tokens by one million (21 billion instead of 21 million.) At first sight it is true and people will believe the sockpuppet propaganda.

There are more negatives. 

The question is, when BCH has been so successful at gaining acceptance in the crypto industry and now moves to public adoption also with success in the early stages, why the push to change the name now??

&gt; No 'LN tokens' to be seen. LN txs are just Bitcoin txs that have not been broadcast to the wider network. Not too different than storing Bitcoin in a paper wallet, and then handing you the paper wallet. Or just giving you my HD wallet. Are these not a Bitcoin txs?

"&gt; Banks often do not need to demand this as the can often see. This is no different then Bitcoin and you seem reluctant to admit this. Why?

I was talking about physical cash when referring to the traceability. Digital money (basically IOUs from the bank to you) does suffer for fungibility issues as well.

Exchanges can still block your account if you fail to comply with KYC, but the problem becomes worse when they can easily lookup known blacklisted addresses. Indeed similar to how banks operate.

&gt; You are talking as though the attack is guarenteed but the defences aren't.

There have been cases where it's been a problem. It's not a guarantee that everyone will suffer of course and there are defenses.

&gt; Does the possibility of me and others doing this mean that USD is not fungibile? Is the possibility enough to remove the property?

My point was that the state protects us from you doing this. This in practice makes USD fungible (or rather mostly fungible, which Bitcoin is as well).

I think that's the key friction between us: Bitcoin is indeed somewhat fungible just as USD both physical and digital, but not perfectly so. You say it won't be a problem and I say it is.

&gt; Not really. You are talking about a novelty.

You're right the problems aren't very prominent. But they show cracks in the system which I only see becomes larger.

&gt; Again, not fungibility. If he moves them then the market may crash because of the implications. That has absolutely nothing to do with fungibility.
&gt; You are confusing fungibility with privacy. A lack of privacy means satoshis spending habits can be observed and effects market conditions.

"I just realised the smaug scenes in the hobbit films would be a great source of new bitcoin memes, get on it team! ",1526579172
"&gt; The point is that with Bitcoin proper you have immediate and exclusive control over your funds whereas with the LN you don't.

You **do** have immediate and exclusive control over **your** funds. This means the funds you didn't spend with the the other side. If we open a channel with 1BTC each, and then I send you .5BTC, I have total control over that .5BTC. And I don't need you to do anything, if I want to close the channel and move the coins away. How is this not having complete control over your funds?

&gt;My point is that there will always be a natural balance between money proper and money substitutes (i.e., on-chain vs. off-chain). 

If I put 1BTC on a paper wallet and give you the paper wallet, would you call that a ""money substitute""? It's clearly an off-chain tx, but is this anything less than a clear Bitcoin tx? (If you don't trust me with copies of the paper wallet, replace ""paper wallet"" with ""OpenDime""... Google it if you don't know it.) These are perfectly valid Bitcoin txs, they just occur off-chain. There's nothing ""lesser"" or ""fake"" about them.

&gt;The problem with an arbitrary limit on the capacity of the former is that it distorts that balance. And that's why I distinguish between ""scaling"" (i.e., increasing the capacity of the money proper) and ""banking"" (i.e., second-layer / off-chain networks). 

Not sure what you mean with this ""balance""... but LN definitely increases the capacity of money proper. Again, think about people passing around an OpenDime stick - Potentially infinite txs, at exactly 0 cost, and no impact whatsoever on the blockchain. But it's off-chain, and it's got absolutely nothing to do with ""banking"".

Also, banks won't disappear because of crypto. It's a common misconception, but I can guarantee they won't, regardless of which crypto will see widespread use. They will simply change business model, and ditch un-profitable businesses, like money transmitting. But we will still need banks AND credit... because a 25yr old will ***NEVER*** have enough money to buy a house to start a family. But that's a topic for another time, perhaps.

&gt;I suppose that if LN represents a radically-improved kind of money substitute

Again, LN is **not** money substitute... it's simply txs that have not been broadcast yet. OpenDime example still applies.

&gt;leverage systems

Agree with the argument, but the key unknown here is the actual amount of leverage. You say

&gt;imagine a LN handling 50 billion tx per day operating atop a base blockchain capable of processing only 300,000 tx per day. Well you can‚Äôt really imagine it, because obviously the system would have failed long before you‚Äôd ever get to that absurd a level of leverage.

Why not? Why is this impossible? Channel factories (Google it if you're unaware) together with Schnorr can reduce the impact on the blockchain by up to 96%! That's a huge reduction. People like to point to the LN whitepaper and the 133MB block size... with 96% reduction that goes down dramatically. But there's more... As I said above, LN is **not the only** scaling solution. On it's own, LN will not be enough. Now take Rootstock... right now it can process ~2000 txs/s. And it's live on main net. That relieves the impact on the bitcoin blockchain again. Or Liquid, which OP was all about... that could relieve all the pressure from exchanges and other large players. 

When you start adding all these pieces, those 50 billion txs per day on a base layer of 1MB start to look a lot more realistic. (Btw, let's stop talking about 1MB... it's 4MB weight now, or if you want to insist with block size, ~2MB.)

&gt;Role of base layer

You are one of the few that accepts the base layer should not be there for everything. Unfortunately your position is drowned by those who shout the loudest about putting all sorts of shit on the blockchain (micro-blogging, twitter, dumping the Bible on it and then some). BCH is literally clogging the blockchain with junk, completely unrelated to anything financial, and yet people are cheering this up. Fuck that. If fees have to be $100 to ***avoid*** this shit, I want fees to be ***$200***, just in case. The base layer should be for financial txs only, not for ""Quotes by cool dude"". 

But to your point, and I think I speak for the entire community that understands the scaling approach more than just on the superficial level, the balance between base layer and higher layers will be established, possibly away from the current restrictions. But it will be established once we have enough meaningful data, not arbitrarily because we think that we'll ""certainly"" need it. In other words, all the possible optimizations *first* (LN, drivechains, sidechains, Schnorr, MAST, bulletproofs, ...) and only *after* we start thinking about the block size. 

And if you're tempted to say that Bitcoin will never increase the block size, that's just not true. The most hard core small-blocker is Luke-jr, hope you'll agree. Even his proposal to *reduce* block size contained a gradual increase that would take us beyond the current size. So even he acknowledges that at some point it will have to happen, but it's about being extremely conservative and cautious instead of reckless. There was a great Tweetstorm by Giacomo Zucco where he says that we have all the time in the world to deliver Bitcoin in a fully decentralized and trustless way, and I agree. Humanity has existed for millenia without a money like Bitcoin, and babies have been dying all along, we can hold tight for another 10.

"My serious thoughts are:

How long have you been here? Are you looking at the technology and the expansion of the space from people and companies investing fiat wealth into it?

Or are you just looking at the price?

Bitcoin is not and never has been something you should buy with fiat in order to one day 'make a return' in fiat.

That is the narrative the overlords are trying to have us all believe.

The truth is that if we simply buy $100 of bitcoin and forget about it and talk to everyone we know about doing the same, in time everyone will have wealth in bitcoin, albeit a small amount. Most people don't have $100 disposable in their bank account. At this point, it makes sense to just trade bitcoin between us REAL people and decrease the amount of times you us THEIR fake money.

This brings the banks and corporations to their knees.

The world changes. Bitcoin becomes the final value settlement layer for everything.

Fake wars - paid for in fake fiat created out if thin air by the most ruthless dumbed down idiots in human history - cease to be a problem.

2 generations down the road people will wonder why we put up with it fir so long.

Forget the 'price', it is an illusion. The price is determined by what people are willing to pay for bitcoin on exchanges.
It is an insignificant amount of bitcoin in the liquidity pool.

"The whole market follows Bitcoin anyways, and like I said there's a lot of actual gems with real teams working on them, with partnerships in the same league as VEN and working githubs. They just refuse to pay the ridicilous listing fees binance charges and would rather wait for binance to list them and binance does list them eventually because they want volume. ",1526578866
"What do you think about Cardano?

Base layer dumb as a rock, proved consensus algorithm underneath.

Treasury system for future development.

I see the potential there to replace Bitcoin even as a store of value, not just as everyday currency.

And they are targeting the unbanked, so a lot of potential for users there (and a really cool vision).

Another aspect I see the value of blockchains is tracking stuff. Supply chains, or some type of assets. It can cut costs for companies for one thing.",1526578843
"Yes yes, I've heard all the arguments a thousand times.  Everyone who cares about staying true to the whitepaper already agrees, everyone else doesn't give a shit.  Everyone knows BCH hates SegWit which is exactly why BCH should have forked earlier.  Either way, SW/LN are no more relevant to BCH than Tangle or CryptoNote.

The BCH community wastes its time circle-jerking to how bad BTC/SW/LN/Blockstream/Greg/AXA/Bilderberg are, *constantly*, when none of that matters.  Success will make it all fade into history.  What matters is people using it, an area where we're failing badly.  There needs to be an uptrend just to stay afloat, and we're dead in the water. 

That's a hard problem, though, so I guess we'll just fall back to the easy non-solutions of criticizing irrelevancies and re-enable some opcodes that have nothing to do with using **Bitcoin as Cash**.",1526578827
"Crypto, yes! Bitcoin, no!",1526578815
"That looks like a solid portfolio! Well diversified in many aspects at first glance!    
I don't really have a specific number for coins I hold, but as there are only a few project I truly believe in long-term (ETH, XMR and to some degree BTC and XRB) they make up at least 80% of my portfolio.  I think one might diversifying too much if your biggest holdings are only 10% (which is clearly not the case for you). Feel free to add some project to your portfolio by any means, but maybe start small and if you still like them in the future add some more :D     
I don't know much about TKY and ELA, but I am a big fan of Ark as I think it is one of the best existing DPOS currencies and has a nice collaborative community around it.    

",1526578780
"Yes, Naver formed ‚ÄòLine Financial‚Äô in japan in January and already applied for a crypto currency exchange business license from the Japanese authorities.

Also Naver‚Äôs blockchain business entity name is ‚ÄòUnblock‚Äô and its purpose will be to incorporate blockchain technology into the Line service and to oversee the crypto currency exchange business in Japan.",1526578774
"People don't seem to agree about the contents of the whitepaper. Some people interpret things to justify they're beliefs. I see this all the time in these subs.

I am however incredibly curious as to why this URL is BTC when it's more about bitcoin cash.",1526578700
why? do you know a better method to judge bitcoin? its not perfect but still better than claim something to be rat poison when you know nothing about it.,1526578694
"Im okay with Bits or even the Cash denomination, ultimately I think the community will decide. 

Bits is already being used and from the looks of it, bits seems to be the community favorite at this time.

I like Cash because it separates Bitcoin Cash from all other currencies that use the bits denomination, thus making it unique to Bitcoin Cash. Bits seems a lot more technical and the whole world is used to Cash. 

Ultimately, either way will work for me, I‚Äôm more concerned with the technology behind the protocol continuing to advance than being hung up on what to call the denomination.

As far as the ticker symbol goes, I think BCH should remain, we‚Äôve already built a reputation behind the BCH symbol and I think it should remain for recognition purposes. ",1526578685
"If the idea of bitcoin is to replace what the dollar is, its market cap should be at least that of what is annually traded. 

It may even be worth more than that. 

There are other currencies in the world too, that's a fact that's long permeated time. Money is only worth what someone is willing to trade for it. ",1526578660
"I not sure that the extra ways SPV can be affected by an eclipse attack that a full node cant are really significant in the real world. 

Anyways, the argument is that the extra adoption caused by having sufficient throughput would be a positive modifier on node count that counteracts the negative modifer on node count of node cost. If most people are running ethereum nodes instead of bitcoin nodes, bitcoin node count is going to go down, even if running one is cheap.


",1526578653
"Confused. On one hand you said to hold your horses and relax, but at the end of your post you said BTC will go anywhere from 6X to 9X in the next 6 months, lol. 

If BTC hits 50k by EOY then the ‚Äúnext bull run!!, early adopter!!‚Äù People we‚Äôre right, no? ",1526578619
"Of course you eventually do have to reach the internet because bitcoin is a global network.  The easiest gateway is just another phone running TxTenna that is connected to the internet, but it could also be a satellite up-link, short wave packet data, SMS relay, carrier pidgeon, sneaker-net, etc.

TxTenna is an open-source project and the goTenna SDK is free to use, so if you think we need more gateway modalities - the limit is only your creativity and technical skill.  ",1526578613
"Open a Coinbase account--&gt;attach your debit card or bank account--&gt;purchase Bitcoin or Ethereum

If you want a larger selection of cryptos:

After purchasing BTC/ETH on Coinbase--&gt;open a Binance account--&gt;go to your balances and click deposit on btc or eth--&gt;copy address--&gt;go to your Coinbase account and click send for btc or eth--&gt;paste the address from Binance and enter the amount you want to send--&gt;wait for the btc or eth arrives in your Binance account--&gt;on Binance go to the exchange and select the 'altcoin' you want to purchase with your btc or eth--&gt;enter the amount you want to purchase and click buy

It still amazes me how difficult this process is to those on the outside looking in, which will surely be the biggest hindrance to the next bull run",1526578590
"It is if you got the right crypto. There are some that are complying with regulations, got huge partners on their side and one of them is going to be used by nearly every machine on the planet and beyond. So I'm not worried at all, but I don't give a shit about the quick buck. I'm just securing my early retirement.",1526578588
"I agree, and people's thoughts on what's going to happen as ""big money"" enters the space.  They don't realize that it's going to partially wreck the 'old' crypto space and make it much more competitive.  They also seem to think the 'big money' is just going to barge in through coinbase, et al and start making market orders through exchanges.  It's like they've never heard of OTC desks and have no concept that big money isn't going to work against its own interests.  There are many misconceptions in the space, and we haven't even scratched the surface of them.",1526578556
"That might be true in the recent volatile environment, but there aren't too many single days where the Bitcoin drops 50&amp;#37;. But in some of these countries their buying power in their local currency could be halved \(or worse\) by the end of the day.  Not saying it's the best store of value. 

I figure people in these places can just hold gold or silver coins instead, but it'd probably be harder to transact regularly with gold and silver coins, but same concept.",1526578528
"&gt; Neutral on that point.

Trying to be too but hard to do, having fought to defend the Bitcoin Cash brand from Lightning's attempts to destroy it for months.",1526578500
"It is not counterproductive actually, one will win. If you don't get that then you need to ""Lurk moar"", sorry wrong website.. There is no future for the miners on BCT, they will kill it. It's in their own self Interest. 

I was in a crack unit during Vietnam, 58 confirmed kills..so I think I know a thing or two about Bitcoin.

",1526578410
"Nope, I don't actually hold any BTC, but the Bitcoin situation is affecting the whole market. I have a diversified portfolio, some of them are profitable, but the overall portfolio is in heavy losses. ",1526578401
"Set price alerts and when your coin hits your mark, check in on development/news. 
There‚Äôs no reason to let crypto consume your life. ",1526578389
"Bit Cash was better than Bits. But seriously, removing the name Bitcoin Cash seems to be a priority, why?",1526578382
"AOL was more than just a messenger and was an internet service provider that did cover service in Europe (At least in the UK, since we had it when I was younger) .
If that's not a convincing enough example for you you can take Cisco systems then. The biggest company in the world during the dotcom bubble and is definitely a global name. It's a survivor of the bubble popping but to this day it  is nowhere near it's height. Don't think just because they're on top now they will be forever. Like people have said we're still pretty early on in the lifespan of crypto, things are still wild and anything can change over the following years. While it is safer to bet on BTC &amp; ETH there's no guarantee they will still be the top dogs in the future.",1526578374
"this would be fine if bitcoin actually looked better

all that shit on her head makes her look really ugly",1526578349
"Just the terrified incumbents trying something else on to try to get HODLers to release those precious HODLed bitcoin.

They'll fail, but they won't stop trying.

They know their days are numbered.",1526578344
"Well, I'm talking about alts that are near all time lows or at least are at a 4 month or so low. Someone who thinks this is just a downtrend of all alts probably wouldn't have alts at this point anyway. I don't see how it would take someone this long to decide to leave their alts for fiat or btc/eth.",1526578340
"**High-voltage direct current**

A high-voltage, direct current (HVDC) electric power transmission system (also called a power superhighway or an electrical superhighway) uses direct current for the bulk transmission of electrical power, in contrast with the more common alternating current (AC) systems. For long-distance transmission, HVDC systems may be less expensive and suffer lower electrical losses. For underwater power cables, HVDC avoids the heavy currents required to charge and discharge the cable capacitance each cycle. For shorter distances, the higher cost of DC conversion equipment compared to an AC system may still be justified, due to other benefits of direct current links.

"'cash' doesn't need to be killed, it's a non event, there is practically no support for it. 

So killing the Bitcoin Cash brand and token so 4 or 5 people stop pushing for a 'cash' sub-unit seems ""a tad"" unnecessary :D",1526578305
There's a lot of development going on for Bitcoin. Perhaps more than for the majority of the coins out there. It may not be so obvious though because there is no CEO or spokesperson shilling shit all day long on twitter.,1526578291
"Yeah I agree but my point is that everything about 'dip your toe in' relies on their current partnership/exploration working out.  There are tons of other options - they aren't impressed with what they see for that particular crypto and end up signing onto another, they decide they can develop something internally, they're approached by another crypto that offers them something too good to refuse etc etc.  I'm not doubting that blockchain will be used by these companies eventually, I'm saying the fact that they're partnering with someone doesn't mean they think it's likely they'll adopt that solution",1526578265
"Point of Sales aren't the only type of transactions BTC can compete with... Try 5-7 days to weeks sometimes to move $$$ across borders! 3-10 mins is def. not slow when it comes down to that!

Merchants could accept 0-Confirmation BTC Transactions for small amounts and it would be instant.

This being said, it doesn't mean BTC is the end-all-be-all, far from it and there's room for other crypto obviously. Yet, having a heavy weight like Square behind the tech is huge for adoption.",1526578243
"Thats a pretty lame criteria for defining what bitcoin is.

In the future I suggest you say ""I feel bcash is the real bitcoin"" then.",1526578222
"This is an awful suggestion, likely to cause tons of confusion for very little gain.

FWIW cash as a unit is also retarded. There's nothing wrong with bitcoin cash, bch, satoshi, etc.",1526578220
I'd like to see her comment on Bitcoin Cash in relation to Legacy BTC's obvious failings.,1526578217
"I do not know pension funds enough to really speak on it but to me something like an index fund would be appropriate. 

Couldn't the ""Teachers Union"" put 2% of their fund into a crypto index?  They would basically be betting the market cap.  

So crypto goes to 3 trillion and all these teachers would benefit from a once in a lifetime investing opportunity.

This assumes my belief of blockchain/ dlt / crypto is the disruptive technology I believe and continued adoption occurs",1526578193
"Bitcoin was mine-able from the get go? If you start a new coin, people ten year from now will complain just the same.",1526578164
50% of my investments are in crypto. The other 50% is in stocks. So yea it would hurt if it went to zero. But I'm willing to risk it as this is a big opportunity if it does take off.,1526578163
"Thanks for the answer.
I managed to contact them, they told me that Newegg only supports Bitcoin payment option in the US and Canada. Not in Europe. So there if anyone is wondering why they can't and they're from the EU you have your answer ! ",1526578154
"Troll appreciation day!

Thanks for helping promote Bitcoin BCH through transparent and childish critiques in the mainstream media.",1526578152
"Ok, this is a fundamental change you are suggesting. At first sight it looks very bad.

Having said that, why not get community feedback on it but first, can you separate the two proposals instead of packaging them as you do now. This is the same mistake that was made with the BU proposal (cashaddress+'cash' subunit).

Can you make two separate posts

- one to propose the 'bit' subdivision (which seems to be supported by most) 
- and a second to propose replacing the name Bitcoin Cash with Bit and replacing its token to one with a millionth of its current value (which is a much bigger change and much less likely to garner support although that remains to be seen).

As it stands the proposal is confusing and I think should be removed.",1526578141
"My personal opinion on where we're at right now, 1) early adopters ran out of money &amp; HODL'ing, (very little move in the market--this likely won't change anytime soon).... 2) crypto 'acceptance' enters the main stream; some hype in media about insitutional investors 'crossing the line' to get a slice of the pie, however, like a teen at their first party can't decide if they'll get in trouble with mom or dad for drinking &amp; can't make up their mind, so, instead of downing a bunch of shitty beers with their friends, they end up getting emotional &amp; forget to have a good time because they can't decide.  A week later, they realize their friend got laid because he down'd a fifth of soco after a 4 game run on the BP table and scored with the hot chick in his science class at the very same party...Translation, remember when your mom or dad opened a facebook account?  Yea, this might take a while.",1526578126
"I thought they were slowly unloading the Mt. Gox Bitcoin anytime, it's over 9000!!!!!",1526578103
"What do you mean? Bitcoin is defined by its whitepaper. That's the purpose of the whitepapers.

The BTC chain is no longer following the Bitcoin idea. ",1526578086
"The 2013 crash was followed by a stagnant market for a couple of years... it's possible for it to happen again, though my personal opinion is that once we break $12k... a new bull run will be much quicker. There has been a lot of amazing news buried in the bear run that puts crypto in a great place",1526578079
"Bitcoin is a crappy store of value, though. It's terribly volatile. 
",1526578067
"Well people that believe in the downtrend might be selling their alts for bitcoin or ethereum. 

That way when it dumps, they can buy back more (usually) because btc/eth don't usually fall as hard as alts. And tend to rise first during the pumps.",1526578048
"I am one of the mid 2017 people who came in that first big wave of noobie entrants to crypto. I became so enthusiastic with all the new possibilities opened to me by this space and got into the ICO game and doing some trading.

The OGs and BTC maximilaists were really down on Ethereum and all these new erc20 token projects. I thought they were just unwilling to see the new era of the crypto market and how far reaching these new projects could be.

Then, over time I began to understand some of the principles they were upholding and how many of the new projects are nothing but cash cows with little fundamental value. 

Watching the coverage around this Consensus I felt really put off. It looked like a love in for traditional money mixed with the over-exuberence of a newly wealthy class flaunting their gains.

This has made me reconsider this entire market.",1526578019
You're mistaken. Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin. Bcore is a corporate shitcoin.,1526578019
"Again, this just isn't accurate.

Where I live, we are using approximately 25% of our energy capacity. The rest is being sold to other areas, for less than we are paying for it. This is because otherwise, it would go to waste. Better to get something for it than nothing.

We are limited to who we can sell to by geography and laws of thermodynamics.

We are utilizing approximately 50% of our hydroelectric energy generation capacity currently. That means that we have 8x more energy than demand. 

If bitcoin mining consumes all of that excess, that is not a bad thing.",1526578017

The *fear* is obvious from those that incorrectly use the term ""bcash"". Bitcoin Cash (BCH) clearly has so much utility and appeal, they're left with no legitimate counterarguments against it and so resort to elementary school name calling. Ask yourself why they don't bother to mount such a concerted name calling campaign against any other cryptocurrency, including those that existed before Bitcoin Cash and already used ""Bitcoin"" as part of their names.",1526577898
"u/taariqlewis asks a controversial question, and u/Peter__R gives a state answer, the linked video is the best verbal articulated explanation I've seen. 

Be warned social consensus does not define bitcoin. No majority can't tell you what it is, only you can define what it is to you. 
",1526577896
"&gt; But the only real argument for not raising the actual block size to ~4MB is that a hard fork is risky

Not so true. If Bitcoin hardforks they will want to roll in other features that require a hardfork simultaneously. More centralised coins hardfork all the time, not so easy with Bitcoin, which is testament to it's decentralisation really... When a hardfork happens it will be more than a blocksize bump.",1526577860
"Consensus was a straight up money grab and scam for finance institutions. Anyone who did not know this going in, is completely out of touch with the crypto scene. Just looking at the speakers panel will show you that. 

The real Crypto community will always be online and everything meaningful started by small groups of people. 

People pandering to institutions ""representing"" crypto our out of touch with what is going on. It's a paradigm shift, and they are outdated systems. We are helping to fundamentally reshape global institutions towards a more tech based system. Crypto &amp; blockchains our the ""pipelines"" to global process payments and verifiable data protocols. AI will be the new business models and the finance backend will be powered by cryptos. 

For example, New agile businesses will look like this: 
Sales/Marketing: Algo marketing, Social Media &amp; Youtube
Finance: Crypto Currencies &amp; Blockchains
Management: AI Systems, IOT &amp; Automation

"Whoops.

Tbh I think yes, BIT is a better ticker, and have no idea how it isn't taken yet!

But, it would be extremely hard to change, frikin' Binance is still on BCC somehow. But, if a couple large exchanges agreed to change, like GDAX and Bitfinex, I would 100% support it. 

I'm neutral on changing the subdivision of it. I get that people want MOAR of a coin, so I see the pros of it, I know somebody who bought XRP because it was so cheap!!! Less than a dollar wow! But the counter is, is that we are trying to market ourselves as the real Bitcoin, and this makes it look like we are something way cheaper and not as valuable. Neutral on that point. ",1526577852
"Crypto does not make anything.   Does not provide food, energy or services.   You use crypto to buy those things from producers.  They use it to buy raw materials, capital and pay salaries. 

If your forecast is true, then it is worse than the banksters. ",1526577845
"Luke is holding a kid and changing the diaper of another so I'll post this for him :

1. What other browser gives half a damn as much about crypto? 

2. What other browser won't sell out your data or implement vendors that do? 

3. What other browser puts the user first: authentic consent, tokens for browsing, ad rev to user, fair cut to publishers, direct relationship opportunity between end user and brands if the user chooses? 

4. What other browser mixes all of the above with sound security policy as priority? 

5. What other companies have the stones to dare to launch both a cross platform browser and be out in front with one of the best utility tokens and utility in production cases on erf? 

6. What other companies are led by people that have been told the odds are ridiculous and have grown browser audiences from 0 to 1 regardless (i.e. Firefox)? 

7. What other browsers have the creator of JS steering the ship? 

We aren't afraid to be there for users, even when it isn't favorable or profitable in every situation. It takes some time to bring everything out in front, but we have been consistent from day 1 and have been delivering, commit by commit, deal by deal, toward fulfilling and proving those aims. 

It's pretty unique imo.",1526577830
"The article is attacking Bitcoin users as if everyone else wasn't committing the same environmental waste. The article I posted isn't misdirection, it's refuting the argument that Bitcoin should be singled out and ""look worse"". That you didn't get that doesn't surprise me though",1526577813
"So person A owns a BTC, person B thinks BTC will go down in value. They borrow a BTC with the agreement to return a BTC in a month and interest. Person B sells BTC to person C.

For what its worth, I don't really think we'll see a 1 million dollar BTC lol. Not one without massive USD inflation, but what do I know. This market is insane and nobody a can really predict where this will end up once the speculative storm passes. ",1526577686

""The number of retailers accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment is declining""

"It is to replace BCH on exchanges with BIT, although I have a feeling it would probably continue to be used on social media for a while.

This would essentially be a two step process. Getting the exchanging to change to BIT and do the stock\-split\-equivalent is much more difficult, so this would have to come after the majority of the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem has already changed over to using bits as the standard denomination. It would require that all major parties would need to support bits. From there it would take LOTS of communication with the exchanges to convert to BITS all on a certain dates. This isn't going to happen over night, and it will take a lot of coordination, but I think it is possible. I think it would add enormous value to Bitcoin Cash to do this.",1526577578
"I understand what you are saying. But there is no reason that vendors could not use a 3rd service with chargebacks and refunds. A Visa like layer on top. I also really think the internet could use some form of native currency (not parroting the Twitter CEO who said that, I have been saying this for years). Even if bitcoin cannot compete with the likes of Visa or Paypal, at least it will bring some competition and hopefully lower fees across the board.
  
  
Also setting up an address for bitcoin transactions costs nothing to create, while with credit cards you have to go through a 3rd party to be able to use a credit card on the web. And it is usually a monthly charge by this 3rd party company to keep using it's services, while a bitcoin address just sits there forever.

Not a single person in the world has accidentally bought Bitcoin Cash when they wanted Bitcoin Core, they are clearly differentiated, and both offered as viable options in their app and on the purchase page.

"&gt; Well banks can demand where the money comes from and shut down that way. But the money could theoretically be perfectly fungible and it wouldn't save you.

You mean banks do demand to know where money comes from. Banks often do not need to demand this as the can often see. This is no different then Bitcoin and you seem reluctant to admit this. Why?

&gt; So far they've been working fairly well. But there are companies that trace transactions through mixers and it's a big potential problem. 

Potential problem, but not guaranteed problem. You are saying Bitcoin is not fungibile because of a theoretical problem not an actual one. You are talking as though the attack is guarenteed but the defences aren't.

&gt; It's also easier to detect if your transactions comes from a mixer and block those transactions.

Only if it is a known mixer. My buddy set up a few and the bank would only know about them if he advertised. Not hard to set up a few with a small private group. Also not hard to set up a wallet that auto mixes with all of their users. 

&gt; If you and many others would do then it would be a big problem.

Does the possibility of me and others doing this mean that USD is not fungibile? Is the possibility enough to remove the property?

&gt; That the market for freshly minted coins at all exists is already proof of fungibility problems. 

Not really. You are talking about a novelty. I prefer freshly minted US dollars over worn. I have paid extra to trade 20s for 100 dollar bills. 

&gt; Other examples include how Satoshi would use his coins (he would likely crash the whole market if they were moved) or coins directly related to big hacks.

Again, not fungibility. If he moves them then the market may crash because of the implications. That has absolutely nothing to do with fungibility.

You are confusing fungibility with privacy. A lack of privacy means satoshis spending habits can be observed and effects market conditions.

I agree Bitcoin needs better privacy, but I don't confuse privacy and fungibility.",1526577239

"&gt; This is imprecise. The control is shared, yes, but you BOTH hold BOTH keys, with a ""final/settlement balance"" receipt. So you are absolutely still holding your keys, though it's in a hot wallet.

My ""vault"" and ""key"" description is an analogy.  The point is that with Bitcoin proper you have *immediate* and *exclusive* control over your funds whereas with the LN you don't.  

&gt;Of course it does. 

My point is that there will always be a natural balance between money proper and money substitutes (i.e., on-chain vs. off-chain). The problem with an arbitrary limit on the capacity of the former is that it distorts that balance. And that's why I distinguish between ""scaling"" (i.e., increasing the capacity of the money proper) and ""banking"" (i.e., second-layer / off-chain networks).  I suppose that *if* LN represents a radically-improved kind of money substitute, that its development could shift where that ""natural balance"" falls, and thereby, in that sense,  constitute a contribution a ""scaling."" But the more fundamental point would remain.

&gt;Risk of loss of funds? Not really. 

&gt;Yes and no... the risk increases if the base is shaky, big or small. 

The base *becomes* ""shakier"" the more ""weight"" you put on top of it.  Systemic failure becomes less and less unlikely (and eventually inevitable) the more highly ‚Äúleveraged‚Äù the system is, i.e., the more the base (blockchain proper) is constrained relative to the layers operating on top of it.  As an extreme example, imagine a LN handling 50 billion tx per day operating atop a base blockchain capable of processing only 300,000 tx per day. Well you *can‚Äôt* really imagine it, because obviously the system would have failed long before you‚Äôd ever get to that absurd a level of leverage.

&gt; The base layer must do one thing (or a few at most) and do it perfectly. **it should not do everything.**

Of course not. Again, there will always be a natural balance between money proper (""the base layer)"" and money substitutes (""second layers"").  Satoshi himself doubted that Bitcoin would be suitable for ""very small micropayments.""  He *did* however think that Bitcoin was ""practical for smaller transactions than are practical with existing payment methods. Small enough to include what you might call the top of the micropayment range.""

"Agree for sure. That said, it still doesnt make it any easier to predict. We may get there faster due to the pace of everything but we still dont know how far we need to go. What i find most interesting is that we may eventually see a new  push to improve the internet itself just to keep up with the developments in crypto. With sufficient incentive, the internet could go through a new growth spurt if blockchain tech at any point reaches the limitation of the internet. Ie. Block propogation: improve code further or bandwidth? At some point the gains from code improvement may become so negligable that we are better off improving internet infrastructure. Right now that may sound outlandish, but with sufficient incentive it may not be such a crazy proposition. Googles search algorithm is a good example. Google spends shed tonnes of money and time to make miniscule improvements to the code because at such vast scale these small improvements matter a lot, even if they cost huge amounts. However as a side effect it has now become far more economical to invest in internet infrastructure as well.

"&gt; Wow lots of information, but none of it shows that the Bitcoin system uses more than the fiat system.

That's because you can't. Both systems are different and the current fiat system is much more complex than the Bitcoin blockchain. 

&gt; These two reasons are true but you are missing the security proposition if POW. 

Please, read my comment again. After referring my points, I spoke regarding the security of Bitcoin. Yes, the power guarantees the integrity of the network. But miners aren't working for the integrity of the network. They work for the mining profit.

&gt;  The energy is not ""wasted"".

Yes it is. Let me tell you why. 

Mining bitcoin blocks requires brute-force solving. **Brute-force solving a valid Bitcoin block is non-deterministic, where every invalid block is wasted energy. Invalid blocks cannot be used for transactions and are useless for the blockchain.** That is why hashing algorithms which focus on security, are developed specifically to cause the maximum amount of energy waste when solved using brute-force techniques. This removes the incentive to try to break the hashing algorithm using brute-force attacks.

&gt; Plus, I claim the energy used is LESS than the Fiat system.

Then prove it.

How is it inevitable when 1/3rd of banks have disallowed ALL crypto purchasing in the past 5 months?",1526576671
"\&gt; Limited utility? Literally everything for sale for bitcoins becomes up for grabs. The attacker can deposit bitcoins to any anonymous exchange, send 100 coins and trade them for alts, withdraw, doublespend to another exchange, rinse repeat. Every exchange would drop Bitcoin. Every retailer would stop accepting. The value would plummet. 

But every single time they do this, it's costing them 75 BTC in mining rewards. So they'd have to sell significantly more than 75 BTC for every double\-spend, which is fairly difficult and will trigger extra review on any exchange, and further, after this fact BTC will take a huge hit. Considering that Bitmain has hundreds of millions of dollars worth of money invested in ASICs, it's simply not worth it to 51&amp;#37; attack the network.

So, if your position is that someone *other* than Bitmain would do this, not to profit but to destroy Bitcoin, the investment would be enormous. You'd need capital far in excess of a billion dollars in hardware and development, which would be a completely sunk cost, not to mention a production time of over a year. And this sort of attack is getting more expensive and more impossible all the time as difficulty rises.

I'm not saying that a 51&amp;#37; attack, were it to occur, wouldn't hurt Bitcoin. I'm saying that there is no financial incentive for anyone to attempt it. The motivation would have to be destruction of Bitcoin, and they'd need to have a massive bankroll.",1526576651

"Whether you get a pay rise or not has nothing to do with inflation or deflation, its set by supply and demand for labor.

Wages can rise faster than inflation or drop faster than deflation.

If demand for labor drops them the price of labor will go down relative to the value of currency, whether that labor is paid for in dollars, bitcoin, yen or gold.

If bitcoin goes up in value, people just don't keep getting paid the same amount of bitcoin anymore than you keep paying 10,000 bitcoin for two pizzas.

Try to get a job now in silicon valley paying 10,000 bitcoin a day if you think somehow deflation will protect you from pay cuts.

It seems your problem isn't with inflation or deflation but the fact that automation and globalization have depressed demand for wages which has depressed demand for labor which has caused wages to become stagnant or fall in some places.

Whether there is inflation or deflation will not change this, as proven by Japan and China.

No miners would do this because it isn't profitable enough for the cost, but to say a well-planned 51% attack wouldn't destroy the network completely is just silly.

This cuts the ground out from underneath the ""full nodes"" religion introduced by Maxwell and Todd. Full nodes are of no help in a 51% attack, which is far more devastating than any attack using invalid blocks. SPV security is equal to ""full node"" security. ",1526576286

"&gt; The goal is to get everyone using SegWit, that's for sure. Why wouldn't we want that?

so you agree that SW as a soft fork is coercive?  by blinding old nodes it progressively forces them to upgrade?  and i'm telling you why we wouldn't want that; why should core devs be able to tell everyone to give SW tx's a centrally planned 75% discount over regular tx's?  how's that fair?  b/c core devs are all knowing and are perfect economists an game theorists that know exactly what the market thinks or wants?  BCH is evidence that they, in fact, don't know these things and split the network anyways with their soft fork due to their inability to compromise and work with big blockists who only wanted to continue what's worked the last 9y.  

&gt;It fixes the malleability problem

TM is only a problem is you want to create strings of unconfirmed tx's via smart contracts if you believe LN is the way to go for scaling.  it should be obvious many do not agree for good reasons and thus fixing TM maybe was never necessary.

&gt;and makes transactions involving several addresses more compressed

it doesn't make them more compressed; it only arbitrarily forces the entire network to process them at a discount.  the extra data (SW tx's are bigger) still has to be transmitted, validated, and stored if SW nodes want to remain as seeders to new bootstrapping full nodes.  there is no actual compression going on to maintain full functionality.  

&gt;Using a soft-fork means that we can get to that point without the contentious issues

did you miss the fact that SW actually caused a chain split to BCH b/c SW was indeed actually contentious?  i must say, the mental gymnastics going on here are impressive.

&gt;do not affect non-SegWit wallets, because they're still completely valid, following the original rules, and not intended for the non-segwit recipients.

you mean a strategy that states ""we'll do what we want over here on our side of the network andsince we've blinded you, you shoulldn't worry"".  well, i do worry b/c that strategy is trying to push all tx's offchain to LN to the disadvantage of the miners who need those fees to pay for diminishing rewards.  LN is not proven, has led to breaking the merchant network effect of BTC, and may not work at all to the detriment of what has been accomplished the last 9y.  

&gt;Had SegWit been a hard fork instead, it may have left many users completely unable to use the network until they had modified their software to be compatible, which takes resources and time.

it's the right way to let the community and market decide.  but it's risky for core devs who apparently don't want to risk their positions or vested interests in letting the market decide if SW is a bad or good idea.  they tried to go around the community by going directly to the miners at the HK backdoor meeting.  that's centralized planning for you.   and so what if a HF temporarily leaves some nodes forked off.  we just went thru that with the 32MB HF.  the sole miner upgraded quickly to avoid further losses and the non mining nodes will too.  no problem.  it's expected.  if 32MB was actually a bad idea or contentious, we'd have a chain split right now.  the BCH devs did the right thing in discussing and educating the BCH community ahead of time and put their reputations at risk by allowing the referendum to be decided via a HF.  b/c it is a good idea to increase to 32MB and re-enable old op codes, their was unanimous agreement for the HF.  no problem.  apparently core dev does not want to take these risks b/c they know deep down, giving a 75% discount to their pet peeve SW project while at the same time forming for-profit companies like Blockstream is perceived to be a high jacking of Bitcoin for personal interest.  thus, soft forks are deemed to be necessary for all sorts of convoluted reasons, which you are regurgitating here.

&gt;But a validating node secures your ability to validate your own transactions, and validate that you are on the right network, which is the one where miners are playing by the rules.

you've stripped their ability to verify the sigs of all tx's in the 100% SW adoption scenario and forced them to depend completely on miner honesty.  it's crazy that you claim nothing has been lost by old nodes and is entirely hypocritical to your anti-miner centralization arguments.

&gt;I personally think that a better form of governance will come from a combination of consensus mechanisms, which may include PoW and prediction markets. We're still early on and at this stage, network development with no distributed consensus mechanism for indicating what the network majority wants is certainly one of the big concerns for the future of Bitcoin (or Bitcoin Cash, whichever becomes widespread).

the key point here is to let the market decide by removing all limitations to scale; like the 1MB limit imposed by Core.  there is enough economic incentive to not fear this as the involved participants have every financial incentive to make the right decision in an honest manner:

""The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest. If a greedy attacker is able to assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth. ""

",1526575679
"He didn't want to specifically say ""I'm sorry about core supporters in general"" because that would make people like you show up, but I guess it didn't work. Core supporters on average are 49% more likely to follow the words of whoever is in charge than your average classical Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash supporter. And when your authorities are who they are, you end up doing dumb and illegal things like breaking into and trashing bitmain's office, general vandalism and in this case fraud.",1526575631

Im very invested in BTC and XMR,1526575005
"&gt;I think we'll have to agree to disagree on that for the moment. If you're interested in my reasoning, [I previously wrote it up quite explicitly with references to Satoshi's white paper.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7q90ro/ive_spent_all_week_trying_to_figure_out_if_the/dsnih4y/)


The white paper reference the longest to explain/describe nodes behavior. 

How they orphan blocks, how they sync up, catch up and how to find consensus.

It is ridiculous to think Satoshi intended it to be defining characteristics amongst different independent chain, for the simple reason the altcoin concept didn‚Äôt even existed yet, hell even the bitcoin blockchain hadn‚Äôt started yet, let alone other chains.

The white paper is a technical paper explains how bitcoin and bitcoin alone should work period, Talking about nakamoto consensus amongst independent chains make no technical sense at all (whatever it is the same PoW or not).",1526574992
"&gt;companies don't go public for random reasons or because they're about to go bankrupt. it's the complete opposite.

I still stand by my statement regarding NYSE being worlds apart from MANY stocks, as your perspective makes it look like all the operations and fundamentals behind all companies is equal, so long as they are ""publicly traded stock"". This is just wrong.

&gt;no one knows why they're doing it besides them

So you infer they're either god-like figures or simply irrational? Besides the very acknowledgement that those with mighty financial clout put their money into this, in itself must have value, whether that's business fundamentals or to fleece those on the ""hype-train"".

&gt;your original question was asking why people don't crash the entire world economy by shorting the stock market to death.

Not really, i never mentioned the global economy. I DID mention stock markets. There are many markets around the world and they are not all made up of the finest businesses around, many have manageable liquidity (for more so than most established cryptos) yet they still exist and thrive. My point stands, why are these not shorted to the ground as you make it seem so simple to do so (and don't go back to giving examples of the 1% elite businesses and why they are so solid when these do not represent the average ""stock"").

&gt;the corporations are provably beneficial to the economy, pay dividends, are stable investments, have a clear roadmap, and don't intend on going out of business.

If you truly believe in this statement, i'll just lol... You should go throw all the money you can get your hands on into a tracker fund and see your gains moon by default as the stock market seems so fundamentally sound it should be near enough impossible for the value to take on a negative outlook...

&gt;so what happens? businesses create their own blockchain technology to serve their needs. they don't need to rely on a crappy company that can't do anything for another 2 years.

By this logic there would hardly ever be cases of large conglomerates acquiring smaller firms or technologies, they would always use a fraction of the cost than paying premiums to shareholders and just create their own ""copies"" as it's cheaper. You really think the achievements of Bitcoin or Etherium can just be boiled up over night in the hands of any one single entity at a cost to resources that makes it more worthwhile to re-invent the wheel than to just adopt an open-source system that is much more proven?

I guess we can just agree to disagree here. In general I can see your points but you speak like the a ""stock"" of a business is a gold mine with undeniable value and cryptos is simply a bunch of gamblers chucking money around. Although this does hold true in many cases, there are also many cases this is not correct and those are the cases we should be looking for value in, not dismissing an entire ""asset class"" in a way.

"Have to say I was in HongKong \(Token2049\) and on the VietnamBlockchain Week.

Vibe was great.  In Vietnam the ticket was 99$ for a normal ticket and 299$ for a VIP ticket. In the VIP areas you had great business talks. In the ""normal"" conference rooms you had great people and crowd.  The talks were ok , speakers good e.g. Neo and Cardano.  But not perfect.    BUT you had the real Crypto people there , everyone with his Blockfolio open and with normal jeans and t\-shirt. I liked that it was really open to everyon with a price of 99$.

Second was HongKong,  was great, but more the Suit fraction there.  Ticket was 999$ I think , but worth it, because of the food, afterparties and also the whole presentations. The moderator was super and you really felt the vibe.    Great talks, but not the normal people there as 999$ is quite a lot. More the projects and CEOs and people from the finance industry.  But it was fun.

Now Consensus. I saw 2000$... , then I checked the speakers and thought ,man this is wallstreet not crypto. I haven't been there, but the agenda was super unattractive. It would be only good to present our project there and make some networking.  Consensus makes a lot of money with these tickets and spaces they give to projects \(which they pay for\).   

I feel Asia is a bit more relaxed and cooler to be in Crypto at the moment.  The conferences feel good.

Moreover I feel we need a non\-profit  WORLD CRYPTO Conference.  If every Crypto project in the TOP 100 would donate a small $ amount, we could pull that off.  Changes every year the continent and the tickets are payable e.g. 99$ is a good price for a 2 days conference.

"&gt; Do you deny that banks shut down accounts for things like online gambling or Bitcoin purchases? How us that different then your example.

Well banks can demand where the money comes from and shut down that way. But the money could theoretically be perfectly fungible and it wouldn't save you.

&gt; That's not true. Mixing services work well for exchange problems.

So far they've been working fairly well. But there are companies that trace transactions through mixers and it's a big potential problem. It's also easier to detect if your transactions comes from a mixer and block those transactions.

&gt; How would that be different then me deciding to only accept USD with even serial.numbers? Don't give me this legal or illegal crap. The fact that I can do it fundamentally breaks the fungibility?

If you and many others would do then it would be a big problem.

That the market for freshly minted coins at all exists is already proof of fungibility problems. Other examples include how Satoshi would use his coins (he would likely crash the whole market if they were moved) or coins directly related to big hacks.

In addition it's much easier to track tainted bitcoin transactions on a large scale than to track serial numbers on physical notes.

&gt; The fact is blacklisting won't work. Mixing is a real thing and anyone attempting to blacklist would give up as it would be ineffective.

On the contrary. Mixing is proved to be ineffective since you can

1. Trace transactions through mixers
2. Detect if mixers are likely to have been used
3. Receive even more tainted coins from the mix. Oops you received coins from silk road, bad luck.",1526574311

"**Gaslighting**

Gaslighting is a form of manipulation that seeks to sow seeds of doubt in a targeted individual or in members of a targeted group, hoping to make them question their own memory, perception, and sanity. Using persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, and lying, it attempts to destabilize the target and delegitimize the target's belief.

Instances may range from the denial by an abuser that previous abusive incidents ever occurred up to the staging of bizarre events by the abuser with the intention of disorienting the victim. The term owes its origin to the 1938 Patrick Hamilton play Gas Light and its 1940 and 1944 film adaptations.

"The rest of your reply demands separate response, however. SegWit is a [massive codified lie](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7tnrvu/nist_report_confirms_bitcoin_is_a_fork_and/dte32ht/) that has now forever polluted the BTC block chain with it's unnecessary complexity and added security vulnerabilities. It has little to no scaling benefit, as can clearly be seen from the extremely marginal capacity increase to BTC even though SegWit has been activated for almost 9 months while still struggling to approach just 40% of all transactions. Even making it the default transaction type in the monopoly Core reference client has not even seemed to help matters. Moreover, SegWit's addition to the BTC block chain has made BTC forever **invalid** per [white paper](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin) Nakamoto Consensus, as the promised ""2x"" block size limit increase that was part of that locked-in consensus agreement was not added at block height 494,783 as was required. So, since the *valid* chain with the most cumulative proof of work is Bitcoin, the moniker rightfully now belongs to BCH, while BTC has forever made itself irrelevant for consideration unless it first rolls itself back to block 494,783 and adds the 2 MB block size limit as promised.  

The claim that SegWit was blocked by the community is further ""fake news"". The truth is, even with massive censorship, deceitful closed-door bargaining, astroturfing, propaganda, encouraging and/or sanctioning DDoS attacks, brigading, among a litany of other unethical actions, Core and Blockstream still could not sway more than 30% to 35% of miner hash rate (never exceeding 40%) to support their poison pill software hack. It's only SegWit2x's farcical promise of adding a 2 MB block size increase that drove miner support to 90%+ by lock-in time, proof that the attraction for the Bitcoin community was the block size limit increase much more so than SegWit.  

Meanwhile, Blockstream and Core have been actively hamstringing a madly successful project for the last 2.5+ years, actively mutating it from the ""Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"" that garnered its early success, into a high fee, high friction store-of-value only system; all the while actively sabotaging and subverting white paper Nakamoto Consensus at every possible opportunity. Ironically, they still try to cling illegitimately to the ""Bitcoin"" name. Where's the sense in this? If your different ideas are so great, why would you want to forever tie yourself like a ball and chain to the ""Bitcoin"" name? ""Bitcoin"" will always be defined by Satoshi Nakamoto's seminal paper, which according to Blockstream/Core/theymos et. al., is loaded with incorrect concepts, mistakes, and a Sybil-resistant consensus mechanism that *needs* to be sabotaged constantly. One would think any self-respecting project would want to clearly set itself apart to show the superiority of its ideas, starting with a unique project name. But the fact that they instead needed to hijack an existing, successful project, desperately grasping its clearly inaccurate name, and then fail to even produce a representative white paper reveals their craven motivations.  

Without the unethical cancer represented by Core/Blockstream + /u/theymos and his censoring horde, *then* Bitcoin would actually be years ahead. But at least we finally have true, honest Bitcoin (Cash) now, and can start to right the years of wrongs inflicted by an unethical minority upon the crypto-community as a whole.  

&gt; Given the trend, just imagine where BCH....  

Nicely useless chart choice there. I particularly like the cherry-picked timescale that coincides with a market-wide slide for the entire cryptocurrency space. I wonder why you couldn't choose an actually representative and informative chart like this one:  

https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin%20cash-transactions.html#log  

Let's compare that with BTC's chart for a similar timescale:  

https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactions.html#log&amp;1y  

Note that dramatic drop off in usage for BTC, while BCH shows underlying steady growth. Zooming out even shows that BTC's transaction volume has recently plummeted to two-year lows.  

But the chart most indicative of what the small-block cabal has done to Bitcoin is this one:  

https://i.imgur.com/giKKQg3.png  

But time will be the ultimate arbiter, so: RemindMe! 2 years ""Bitcoin Cash has collapsed to nothingness!!1!""

Restoring many of Satoshi's intended opcodes is only part of the restoration process required to recover from BSCore cancer (much more, like removing RBF, allowing useful zero-conf, adding developer decentralization has already largely been accomplished), but rest assured, this ethical and censorship-intolerant community continues to support the ideals set out in the white paper and is committed to this recovery process, and to bringing Bitcoin to the world as it was originally intended.",1526573975
"Signs that alt-coins/blockchain is overrated:

Blockchain is more expensive than a centralized database. The advantage is decentralized verification of data. 

If you arent willing to pay extra money for decentralized data verification, a service wont use blockchain. From my years of being in crypto. I think this is limited to Currencies, Voting, and Timestamping data.

"Yes, I do. None of this is technically possible while we have transaction malleability.

Transaction malleability allows you to create long chains of digitally signed transactions facilitating the ability to make a transaction that transfers ownership of bitcoin without writing the transaction to the blockchain. 

While we have transaction malleability these long chains are insecure, and we all have an incentive to confirm transactions on the blockchain. 

As soon as someone has the ability to transfer value through a chain that is secured by the blockchain at the root but is not on the blockchain we could wind up with a 2 layer system where we are not all equal players",1526573955

"/facepalm

1) Because its valuable and PoS is yet to be unproven. Bitcoin developers are exteremely conservative and won't risk the security of the network.

2) No its not, centralization of mining is a problem but power is definately not centralized. Most miners wanted to switch segwit 2x, but it failed. Bcash also failed to achieve consensus. Do you remember the idiotic posts at r/btc such as operation dragonslayer? People didn't want it so miners followed the profits. Miners do no enforce consensus, full nodes does. Bitcoin is the most decentralized cryptocurrency, no ICOs, no governing body, truely open source development with multiple teams ( 3 different teams are working on different implementations of LN afair).

3) It takes 10 minutes on average. Difficulty is adjusted byweekly to keep average blocktime 10 minutes. This is factually wrong. Sure it gets expensive sometimes, but its an unsolved problem. Most brilliant minds on the field are working on it. People are just stupid and think their shitcoin has solved it because they compromised security or centralization for faster transactions.",1526573866
"The goal is to get everyone using SegWit, that's for sure. Why wouldn't we want that? It fixes the malleability problem, and makes transactions involving several addresses more compressed. Using a soft-fork means that we can get to that point without the contentious issues, which I've made clear previously, do not affect non-SegWit wallets, because they're still completely valid, following the original rules, and not intended for the non-segwit recipients.

Had SegWit been a hard fork instead, it may have left many users completely unable to use the network until they had modified their software to be compatible, which takes resources and time.

&gt; actually, you're using an argument promoted by BCH. 

I admitted it was promoted by BCH in the previous post, and it's true that non-mining nodes do not secure the network *for other users*. But a validating node secures your ability to validate your own transactions, and validate that you are on the right network, which is the one where miners are playing by the rules. Running a non-mining node is for yourself, but at the same time, many non-mining nodes, particularly when they're run by merchants who need to verify the payments they're accepting, contribute to keeping miners honest, because they aren't going to fork away from the chain where all the economic activity occurs.

&gt; Core users disagree with this vehemently; hence UASF.

FWIW, I don't agree that UASF is a valid form of governance because it is severely vulnerable to Sybils. It may be (or have been) useful as an indicator of what network users plan to do with their nodes, but it doesn't have a future.

But other arguments, that miners can decide hard forks, are equally as vulnerable to attack, and is not a practical governance model if miners are not scrutinized by a network of spectating nodes.

I personally think that a better form of governance will come from a combination of consensus mechanisms, which may include PoW and prediction markets. We're still early on and at this stage, network development with no distributed consensus mechanism for indicating what the network majority wants is certainly one of the big concerns for the future of Bitcoin (or Bitcoin Cash, whichever becomes widespread).

Also, to answer the poster's question anyway, the pools that have upgraded would mine, the ones that hadn't would see activity drop off.  The exchanges that hadn't would see a lot less blocks, so deposit or withdraw of BCH would be limited.  Those who want to follow the majority fork would adjust and damage would likely be minimal.  If any miners remained, a scammer might be able to get an exchange to accept a deposit on the old chain before this was caught, but it seems unlikely, and the scammer would have to have had legitimate BCH in order to pull off the scam, so damage to larger exchanges would most likely be very minimal even in that scenario.",1526573800

**4: Satoshi's Vision**: Satoshi mentions at one point that they can solve scaling by announcing network updates as they go to change block size, etc. My argument is that neither BTC nor BCH can claim to be following Satoshi's vision because Satoshi is talking about centralized leadership here, something that would never fly with either fork.

"&gt;But neither is it the ""be your own bank"" of Bitcoin proper (the coins are in your own vault and only you hold the key). It's kind of a hybrid model where you and your bank / hub both lend funds to an entity (the channel) over which control is shared.

This is imprecise. The control is shared, yes, but you BOTH hold BOTH keys, with a ""final/settlement balance"" receipt. So you are absolutely still holding your keys, though it's in a hot wallet.

This ""entity"" you mention, ""the channel"", is nothing but an ordinary Bitcoin address. No different than any other multisig address. So if you want to claim that multisig addresses in Bitcoin Cash are entities to which you ""lend funds"", then you can claim the same for LN. But if the former is not true, neither is the latter.

&gt;But... it has nothing to do with scaling Bitcoin.

Of course it does. Your subsequent comment is overall accurate, you cannot say that because LN introduces an inconvenience it is not related to scaling. (Keep in mind, people with a better understanding will NOT claim LN will solve all the scaling issue, but it IS part of the puzzle. Other parts are sidechains like Liquid, which is completely different from LN. There's more, of course.) 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The fundamental problem is that when you move transactions onto a ""second layer,"" you have, by definition, added a layer of risk. 


Yes, agreed 100%. But we need to be careful about *what kind of risk* we are talking about. If you're talking about software risk, well... that's true with every single technology out there. Even Bitcoin at first was explotable (~180bn Bitcoin mined) or DDoS'ed (hence introduction of block limit in the first place). As you learn about potential problems, you fix the code. That's the natural cycle of development.

Risk of loss of funds? Not really. (Assuming the software is rock solid.) Yes, you must address some new problems introduced by the new design, but this is present in every aspect of *complex* life. Take humans - We have organs, which can get cancer. This problem doesn't exist at the single-cell level. But single-cell organisms are not a particularly advanced stage of evolution!

&gt;And that risk increases the more the main chain is artificially constrained -- the smaller your ""base,"" the more precarious the structures built on top of it.

Yes and no... the risk increases if the base is shaky, big or small. But if the base is 99.998+% uptime since inception, that's robust and stable beyond words. The base layer must do one thing (or a few at most) and do it perfectly. it **should not do everything**. Every complex piece of engineering works like that. Think of an OS - Do you build support for every single piece of hardware directly into the kernel? Or coding... do you code everything in assembly? Law... is my dispute with my neighbour over his dog shitting in my lawn supposed to be addressed by supreme justices, who are gonna read the related piece of legislation directly off the constitution?

That's the approach Bitcoin has adopted: The base layer is rock solid beyond imagination. Other layers will take care of all the different use cases. Smart contracts? Sidechain (Rootstock). Instant and trustless transfer between large entities? Sidechain, say Liquid. Coffee purchases? LN. These, and all the uses cases that people have yet to come up with, backed by an immutable and impenetrable base layer. I think the high fees on-chain are well worth paying to get all this delivered.

"&gt;You are comparing work between chain, important information but not related to nakamoto consensus.

I think we'll have to agree to disagree on that for the moment. If you're interested in my reasoning, [I previously wrote it up quite explicitly with references to Satoshi's white paper.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7q90ro/ive_spent_all_week_trying_to_figure_out_if_the/dsnih4y/)

&gt; Note that you can also easily compare chain with diferent algorithm, just compare the energy expenditure, it directly relate to the security invested in the chains.

While it is possible to make meaningful comparisons across chains which do not share compatible work, it becomes quite complex when they involve different algorithms, from a different genesis, over a different duration. Although energy expended is a major factor, it is not a sufficient measure by which to judge the capability of one work source to affect the consensus of an incompatible rival. Investment in specialized hardware inhibits the direct conversion of energy across incompatible chains.

How difficult it is to convert between work is a contributing component of work fitness. ASIC-compatible work has an advantage over ASIC-resistent work in this regard. By encouraging investment in specialized hardware, the incentives for work providers to maintain the value of their investment by achieving future-consistency are continuously reinforced. In providing an alternate revenue source for their work capacity, one which would result in defection from prior consensus were it to acquire a majority, BCH is a threat to BTC's soundness in a way that a chain formed by incompatible work is not. _I am not threatened by BCH, personally_, in fact, I welcome the opportunity to see if the SHA256d work providers can succeed in maintaining a consistent consensus.",1526572830

let's take this to it's logical conclusion.  the goal of SW is to make every tx a SW tx.  in the case of 100% SW adoption, an old node cannot verify one tx it has to accept as truth what is passed to it by a miner in the form of a block.  that is hardly a functioning full node even by your definition and esp of the WP which describes Bitcoin as a chain of digital signatures.  furthermore, if the old node decides to discard the witness blocks since it can't recognize it, it can no longer upload a fresh copy of this SW ledger to new bootstrapping full nodes b/c it can't provide the sigs that are necessary for that new full node to validate the chain to date.

"&gt;SegWit is a sufficient fix, and was done in a way that avoided a contentious hard fork, and didn't upset the majority of users 

No, it DID result in a contentious hard fork, which is what Bitcoin Cash IS. I would have been perfectly happy accepting segwit if it came with a non-witness blocksize increase of 2mb, instead of being used as an excuse to never hard fork. The problem is that Bitcoin Core has been captured by people that can program reasonably well, but are absolute morons when it comes to all the other aspects that are required to run a successful project.

If Bitcoin has so many actively used usecases that blocks are so big that I cant even run a full node (This would take years even with 32mb blocks, and at that point we likely have better optimizations anyways), I would be perfectly fine just running an SPV node. Bitcoin was always envisioned to work this way by satoshi and most of the early adopters.

What will it take for consumers to jump to decentralized apps? Start with knowing what consumers want.

Square cofounder Jack Dorsey said a hackathon that allowed him to use bitcoin (BTC) to buy the proverbial cup of coffee inspired the user experience of the company‚Äôs peer-to-peer Cash App.

‚ÄúWe wanted to make money as simple as sending an email,‚Äù Dorsey said of the principle driving the consumer-focused app during the Consensus 2018 conference in New York on Wednesday.

At the same time, understanding consumer preferences is a two-way street. Seeing users trying to buy and sell bitcoin using Square‚Äôs technology was what led it to become the first public company to enable the buying and selling of crypto, according to Dorsey.

Users ‚Äúshowed their intent,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe took that as a lead, wanting to learn deeply and increase our appetite for risk.‚Äù

"&gt; Who says this? Almost every day I see something about unlimited blocks. Just yesterday there was a top up-voted post in this sub which suggested completely removing the block-size in the next network upgrade.

again, you're misunderstanding.  yes, ideally the limit should be removed completely.  but will that immediately result in terabyte blocks?  NO.  as BCH is amply demonstrating, in distinct contrast to the FUD from Maxwell, are blocks conforming to economic demand currently still well under 1MB.  there was no explosion immediately to either 8MB or 32MB blocks like core FUDDED. even if there was demand or spamming, miners can control the size of blocks produced thus preventing the network from getting too centralized or even destroyed.  and they will do just this to prevent investment from exiting Bitcoin.  

&gt;The concerns about big blocks are not purely about miners acting dishonestly, but also about further centralization of the network resources.

this is just FUD.  miner decentralization has never been greater:  https://blockchain.info/pools

&gt;but may delegate transaction validation to some other party, or many miners might pool resources into validation to save costs

but there is no evidence of this either.  more FUD.  with miners making so much money, why should they ever need to pool validation resources?  it's easy to run a full node; i do it myself for little to no cost.  and i'll be able to do it even when blocks are much bigger as price rises from wider usage and tech improves.

&gt; If very few people are able to be full participants of the network, they become easy targets for big governments to interfere.

this is obvious but nowhere near the reality.  more FUD.

&gt;Also, because one of the main concerns with big blocks is latency of propagation, the people involved in validation would be incentivized to actually host their servers in the same physical location, similar to HFT traders all host their servers in ULLDMA facilities to have any chance of competing. This makes them a very easy target for governments.

latency is being improved upon already with xthins and graphene.  blocks propagate across the world in a few seconds. where's the problem?  and no, not every mining pool can or would want to be located in China just to be close to other miners.  we see new operations opening up all the time round the world.  besides, the Chinese gvt is forcing miners out of China these days to all parts of the world.

bottomline here is to continue with what's worked the last 9y, onchain increases in block formation with a limit well above economic demand.  THAT is what has gotten us here, not some pie in the sky theoretical offchain LN that is likely not to work.  Core theory has already been disproven by the ejection of Maxwell and his theories and now BCH with it's hard forking and big blocks.  you've lost.",1526571718

PoS changes the delicate game theory that keeps a decentralised trustless system in balance, if it can be shown to work, and indeed improve decentralisation and security, then I believe Bitcoin will adopt it. But for now, it's the folklore of whitepapers while Bitcoin keeps trucking.

By the way, if Bitmain attacked their golden goose with a 45% attack, it would gain them nothing and lose them everything.

"&gt;&amp;gt;Talking about currency soundness, 

&gt;The soundness of the consensus system must be established before there is any use worrying about the functionality a currency based on it. Without sound consensus,  justifiable confidence in its ledger is compromised. What good for use as a currency are tokens of an unreliable ledger?

The currency lacking soundness is the one having the most PoW.

Its BTC that fail at being a currency not BCH.

(Though I disagree BCH didn‚Äôt demonstrate soundness with regards to consensus, incentives to attack are immense, yet nobody even tried)

&gt;&amp;gt; And regarding Nakamoto consensus, it only apply within chain of compatible rules.

&gt;This would be our largest philosophical difference. I am of the opinion that it applies within all systems sharing compatible work. Only one such system can demonstrate that no other measured source of work capacity exists which could affect its future consistency or may have already manipulated its prior consistency. That does not mean the majority system itself is _necessarily_ sound, but it is the only one that has the possibility of being sound.

Your definition of consensus doesn‚Äôt relates any protocol behavior.

You are comparing work between chain, important information but not related to nakamoto consensus.

Note that you can also easily compare chain with diferent algorithm, just compare the energy expenditure, it directly relate to the security invested in the chains.

"&gt;Great question. So, we'll be able to talk about this in more detail in the future, but I can tell you that in essence, the model of the universal payments solution really is for IBM to help provide a network that brings together money service providers/money transfer operators, which could include banks but also non\-bank entities, operating in specific jurisdictions that provide endpoints on the network. It's those entities that are essentially providing liquidity between the digital asset or crypto space and the fiat currency space. So those are the liquidity providers or the market makers, depending on the terminology you want to use. IBM is trying to build this network of networks so that different money service businesses or banks in different regions can use each other's endpoints to actually move money in real time to anywhere in the world with low friction. So IBM is not providing liquidity. IBM is providing the network and the operations, APIs, standardization, to allow this participation of financial services companies on a global scale. I hope that answers the question, at least at a high level.",1526570705

"&gt; like i said, you don't understand the big block argument which never says that. 

Who says this? Almost every day I see something about unlimited blocks. Just yesterday there was a top up-voted post in this sub which suggested completely removing the block-size in the next network upgrade.

I'm not against Bitcoin Cash existing and testing larger blocks anyway, I'm all for multiple areas of research, but you're arguing that the BCH side thinks both should exist in parallel, in a thread which is attacking one side because it's not their side. (Re-read the title of this thread)

I don't go around attacking BCH for the sake of it, but I do have a tendency to trigger fundamentalists or people who are technically incompetent and dismiss technology they don't understand (such as most posts about LN on this sub). Most of my posts are intended to try and clear up misconceptions about how LN works or will work, or how I don't think enormous blocks can work in a decentralized network.

&gt; the only one's who are economically incentivized to ensure the honest functioning of the network are the one's who get paid by the protocol; miners.

This is a false narrative. Every network participant is incentivized to ensure the honest functioning of it, because they have money in the network which is at stake if the network doesn't act honestly.

Miners are the only entity who can *profit* from ensuring the honest functioning, but they are certainly not the only party who are incentivized to do so. Also, miners are only incentivized to act honestly if their investment is at risk of losing value, but if enough miners collude to adjust the network in their favor (of miners collectively), and not enough non-miners are holding them to account, then the economic incentives are not fair for all network participants.

The concerns about big blocks are not purely about miners acting dishonestly, but also about further centralization of the network resources. Miners will not necessarily validate themselves, but may delegate transaction validation to some other party, or many miners might pool resources into validation to save costs. If very few people are able to be full participants of the network, they become easy targets for big governments to interfere. Also, because one of the main concerns with big blocks is latency of propagation, the people involved in validation would be incentivized to actually host their servers in the same physical location, similar to HFT traders all host their servers in ULLDMA facilities to have any chance of competing. This makes them a very easy target for governments.",1526570430

"The LN obviously isn't traditional fully-custodial ""banking"" (i.e. you put the coins in the bank's vault and only they hold the key). But *neither* is it the ""be your own bank"" of Bitcoin proper (the coins are in your own vault and only you hold the key). It's kind of a hybrid model where you and your bank / hub both lend funds to an entity (the channel) over which control is shared.  It's an interesting idea and it might even ""work,"" i.e. prove useful for certain niche use cases.  But... it has nothing to do with scaling Bitcoin.  Borrowing from a previous comment of mine:

A LN payment, which takes the form of updating the state of an open channel (and obviously occurs off-chain), is a necessarily imperfect substitute for a payment that takes the form of an actual, confirmed, on-chain transaction. How can you get defrauded in the latter case? If the person paying you manages to pull off a double spend. The good news is changing the public history of transactions in such a manner ""quickly becomes computationally impractical for an attacker... if honest nodes control a majority of CPU power."" How can you get defrauded in the former case? Well, the nature of the LN is such that if one party closes a channel in an old state in an attempt to steal from you, you must act to block the attempted theft by getting your own ""breach remedy transaction"" added to the blockchain within a defined ""dispute period."" That is a fundamentally different (and weaker) security model. It depends on a user's supposed ability to, when needed, get an on-chain transaction confirmed on the blockchain in a timely manner which is of course exactly what's compromised by imposing an arbitrary constraint on on-chain capacity. It's what I call [the LN's ""fractional-teller banking"" problem.](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4rdkiy/heres_how_bitcoins_lightning_network_could_fail/d50akqm/)  **The fundamental problem is that when you move transactions onto a ""second layer,"" you have, by definition, added a layer of risk. And that risk increases the more the main chain is artificially constrained -- the smaller your ""base,"" the more precarious the structures built on top of it.** 

But an even simpler way to see why the LN isn't some magical free lunch that eliminates the need for actual (i.e., on-chain) scaling is to consider some basic math. Payment channels require on-chain transactions for their creation. Well, at 3 tx/sec it would take the world's 7 billion people a minimum of about 76 years (!) to each make a single on-chain transaction.",1526569137

Not at all. Nowhere near. Zero. Nada. Niet. Liquid is to move funds from one exchange to another, no lending/borrowing involved. 

What you can say is that Liquid is similar to the SWIFT system, which is used internationally for moving money between banks. With one difference - Liquid can be used by larger merchants as well, it's not restricted to exchanges. Exchanges are just the natural candidates as they have tons of funds lying around, but a big corp could do the same. In the fiat economy all these funds movements happen through a bank, which gets killed here... again in a trustless setup. So Liquid is very much in the spirit of Bitcoin, doing away with trusted intermediaries.

Nothing to do with borrowing/lending. Nothing.

"I really don‚Äôt like the idea of **working with banks **. Which part of crypto they don‚Äôt understand?  
  
We don‚Äôt want crypto to go down the same ol‚Äô centralized fiat money route where the rich gets richer and only a select few get absurdly rich.  
  
Crypto aims to free everyone from the limitations of a centralized financial system where everyone has the financial freedom and opportunity regardless of what anyone **thinks** or **permits**.  
  
**If you are supporting banks and are reading this, drill this into your head. We don‚Äôt want banks and governments controlling our money. Either you accept this fact that the old game is over or crypto will fight the archaic financial structure till the end.** ",1526568354
"I didn't attend Consensus but I've closely watched it develop online. Institutional attention, ""world tokenizers"" looking for ""blockchain"" uses, fancy panels &amp; lunches and clear intentions: growing established business. That's why it was full of suits. 

IMO crypto is a revolution. It's about fucking banks. Code, code, code. Ideas flourish in small but meaningful meetups. The intention is creating a new paradigm away from current power. 

I don't like divisive speech, but sometimes you have to choose sides. Consensus does not represent any of crypto's most important values. ",1526568349
"Great!

**BCH Fee Metrics do NOT Reflect BCH capabilities**

Ave. reported *fee* metrics for BCH do NOT reflect reality because there are so many wallets that have crippled coin fee calculation infection! Those involved/experienced in the BCH community KNOW that EVERY tx with 1-sat/fee WILL get into the next block.

We cannot afford newcomers to BCH, particularly those new to crypto to get hosed on fees when one of the biggest features of BCH is near-zero fees! 

Obviously this is NOT a BCH problem, it is wallets that have not bothered to de-couple their BCH fee settings/calculations from the crippled coin fee calculation mess. And just another reason why newcomers would likely be best served by a BCH ONLY wallet!

**Recommend/Prioritize Wallets by proper fee Settings (and possibly other features like BCH only)**

I suggest that ONLY BCH wallets that default to 1-sat/byte fees be listed on Bitcoin.com/Bitcoincash.org. Alternatively, have a segregated section list wallets that support BCH but have improper fee settings and this should help shame these wallets into getting with the program and not screwing their users.",1526568341

Long story short: If I want to short an asset, I'll borrow it from someone that is willing to lend it out, and sell it immediately on the market, with the promise that I will repay the party I'm borrowing form, some time in the future. 

What this means in practice is that when someone shorts something, it is immediately sold on the market, and looks no different than someone selling their own bitcoin. 

It's exactly like buying bitcoin and then selling it later, but reversed. You sell bitcoin now, hoping to buy it back later at a lower price. 

You only need a party willing to lend you bitcoin, and a party willing to buy bitcoin. There are plenty of each, because the rates for lending bitcoins to people for shorting purposes are extremely high, and the amount of people willing to buy bitcoins are extremely high. 

a short sale looks exactly like a sale of any other kind, as far as the market is concerned, and doesn't require any special counter parties that normal sales wouldn't require, other than someone lending their bitcoin. ",1526567589

"&gt; Uses a lot of electricity.

Yes. Because it holds *by far* the most value. Any PoW coin would use the same amount if it had that marketcap. That electricity buys security, you don't get security without a tangible trade off. PoW is by far the best solution to this problem. I wish it were sustainable and renewable electricity though. It's certainly is a problem.

&gt; Is extremely centralised. Bitcoin is currently a single-point-of-failure technology. You only need 1 malicious actor within Bitmain to launch a 45% attack, which has a very high rate of success. All that is protecting Bitcoin right now is security within Bitmain. That's exactly zero security in InfoSec.

I think you mean a 51% attack. Yes more miners are needed. And yes NVIDIA and Halong are entering the game. Lot's of competition to come. I expect Bitmain's lead to dwindle over the next 5 years.

It takes 10 minutes for a confirmation, as it always has. But On-Chain transactions are going to be like snail-mail to email soon. Blockchain tech is all about layers. LN network is instant and can handle more than VISA for next-to-no fee. And that's the first stab at payments on layer 2. Did you know we are chatting on layer 7 of the internet?

"This is a good point Designer. Let me clear it up for you and our viewers at home.

## TLDR

- BCH fees for the next block are highly predictable @1 sat/byte. Wallets do not need to worry about the fees.
- BTC fees for the next block are highly unpredictable @1 - 2000+ sats/byte and can shoot up at any moment when transaction volume increases. Wallets need to be conservative or risk users getting angry with stuck transactions.

## Bitcoin Cash (BCH) chain - 1 or 2 sats/byte is fine at all times

For a wallet, fixing fees at 1 sat/byte on BCH is a reasonable design decision. Dynamic fees would mean changing from 1 to 2. So a wallet setting fees at 30 sats/byte is ridiculous.

[This](https://imgur.com/0pYAB2s) is the worst case of pending fees in the history of Bitcoin Cash after the fork. You can see that total pending fees are roughly zero all the time. That meeans that whatever fee you set, your transaction will get into the next block. The worst case was a weird spike (I forget the reason), of 1.4BCH @$1300 --&gt; ~$1,800 USD in pending fees.

## Pre-Bitcoin Cash chain / Bitcoin Core (BTC) chain - fees have been 500 to 2000+ sats/byte for weeks at a time, multiple times

When blocks are full, users have to compete with each other for block space and the fees go through the roof as you would reasonably expect. So a wallet setting high fees is a reasonable thing to do in order to make sure you beat other users.

[This](https://imgur.com/5ocQY8X) is the second time that BTC fees went ballistic with full blocks. The peak of 360 BTC @$15,900 --&gt; ***~$5,700,000 in pending fees***, not transactions.

Additionally that was during a period where ~25,000 transactions were just dropped from the mempool. ",1526566416

IBM doesn't have any plans right now in the financial services space to employ Bitcoin as part of any of our solutions.
2. I think the ones to look at are kind of the obvious ones such as Hyperledger Fabric, which is something to be looking closely at. Stellar is another one. Ethereum is another that you should be looking at if you're trying to size up the available capabilities for applying blockchain to your specific use case.

From the mining perspective larger blocks will increase the orphan rate and put major centralization pressure on the mining ecosystem. Larger players with better resources can deal with orphan risks much better than smaller ones can.

From the point of view of the network itself, you have to consider the cost of serving all the SPV nodes. They have to get their data from somewhere and they can only do so from open nodes that are both outgoing and incoming. The less nodes there are, the more pressure there will be on the few that exist.

That said, I don't side with the bigblockers' side of the debate, but the frustration there is something i do get.

"Your coins are ""locked"" into that channel so long as the actor on the other side of the channel is either trusted or watched constantly.

Poor people living in Africa today can barely afford a smartphone as their only computing device and don't have enough storage to verify the BTC blockchain by themselves. According to your own metrics Core devs have already failed in that mission.

Constantly online to monitor your LN channel(s) means bandwidth and memory resources will also be constantly consumed by this non-passive task. Everybody hates those stupid bloatware apps that remain open in the background and cut down on battery life, but somehow you think they'll want to constantly run an LN client.

The limit on BTC will increase exactly when Core and Blockstream say it will increase. It has nothing to do with community consensus because the definition of such is constantly changed by these dishonest hacks. 

When the number of BU nodes first surpassed 1,000 BS/Core said node count means nothing in terms of consensus. When SW2X was about to increase MAXBLOCKSIZE to 2MB suddenly the node count was extremely important in terms of consensus and thus UASF was born.

&gt;Instead of using the Bitcoin blockchain, Liquid pegs transactions on and off of it. The miners are not at all part of the scheme. Instead, transaction fees are partially for functionary profit, but they are mainly used to support the hefty transactions required to peg out of BTC from Liquid. The amount of said fees is yet to be determined but is predicted to be radically more stable than in Bitcoin.

The predominant (and probably only) use case of BTC is as a trading pair, were exchange-to-exchange transactions  be moved off-chain, miners would lose out on a modest proportion of profits gained from transaction fees. If liquid does gain traction, it will be interesting to see how miners react as they watch the core chain self immolate.

&gt;  In the longrun (2050s)

I don't think we have until 2050. I expect massive global adoption by 2040. Adoption rates of technology are accelerating, and half of the ""third world"" already have smartphones, which they use for all of their communications. Most of them do not have a home PC or even the ability to afford to run a server, that's for sure, but a smartphone *is* capable of running a full Bitcoin node with a sufficiently sized SD card. Also, most users will be able to afford a single-board computer and a small (several TB HDD) which will become commoditized to point where it'll probably be integrated into their WiFi router at home anyway.

The problem with second layer on gigantic blocks is that nobody will be able to run nodes (without inherently trusting watchtowers). The concerns about big ""hubs"" arising in such network, which is one of the arguments BCHers are using against LN network now, will actually be a reality when few people can actually afford to run a validating node (required to run a full LN node).

If the BCH community decided that they were going to put a reasonable cap on block size (below GB sizes), as the future roadmap, I would probably jump ship and join you, but because the roadmap has been publicly declared as ever-increasing block size, I don't see it as a viable option for future use.

As for the ""damage done to Bitcoin"", I don't actually see it as that big damage. It's clear that the technology is not yet ready for mainstream use anyway. On both sides, there are still significant usability issues before regular users will be able to use it for everyday transactions, and we will need some time to get the technology right so that when masses do adopt it, we're ready for it.

Bear in mind that there are probably only about ~30M people who've actually used cryptocurrency, and only a portion of them are technically competent enough to secure their own funds and use it as a means of exchange regularly. This means that we're still 2 orders of magnitude away from global adoption. When it begins, those numbers will grow at unimaginable rates, and it's a certainty that we don't yet have the infrastructure to support it.",1526564471

Just seems like the perfect platform for cryptocurrency enthusiasts.. A comment I read earlier brought up a good point about how it‚Äôs a good use of blockchain working in the background. It‚Äôs a fair point. So if we‚Äôre all about Blockchain use cases, then why no love for steemit / why are we all still on Reddit?

"The coinbase contributes to setting the value of bitcoin - yes. The most important aspect of a currency is its use as a stable store of value, not its ability to track some arbitrary thing in the world. It's important for it not to be too overpriced so that you can still make meaningful use of a satoshi. Then the price to use that golem contract could be set at x bitcoin, and prices can change, just like the price list at a cake shop.",1526563562

"1. That's what it seemed it was going to be. There's a wave of confusion in terms of who the key interests in the crypto markets are: are we catering to every day individuals and first time market entrants, seasoned investors, businesses, banks, govs or tech hubs.

2. Are you surprised? We're fixated on the notion of profits versus adaptability - that's why we have bankers shorting BTC and ETH yet everyone is too shit-brained to push for scalability. We're not seeing the bigger picture and viability of the tech associated with crypto/blockchain, instead, it's all green candles and bragging rights of moonlambos. 

3. Again, rehashing my last 2 points: we need to focus on scalability and real-world consumer adaptability. Yes, 90% of ICOs will fail because they're complete and utter garbage; fixated on quick turnovers and ideal exit strategies then onto the next one. If you browse the list of available tokens, 98% are dumb fucking ideas or scams, and 1% are forks/reconfigs of BTC to ride off the name. The other 1% are viable but are being drowned out in market cap and use because they're not skyrocketing overnight. We're a fucked community and really need to reassess our shit if we want to see change.  ",1526563495

"What can else do you expect? Every industry that starts to mature finds itself in this situation. Ok, you got into this for some ideological reason. Fair enough, it started as a good ideology. The problem is, if the industry wants mass adoption (which it does) then the message needs to evolve. 

Bankers and the adoption by financial institutions will be the crux that blasts crypto into the real world. This does not mean that your ideological view of crypto has to change. It just means some coins and systems will have less of what you came for. 

As for an industry conference like this. Part of getting older. I have been to many different industry events like this, in several different industries.

Second, as with most lies there is some truth.
Larger blocksize can drop fees and speed up transaction times, but many view this method as a band-aid not a solution. Those opposed would rather use solutions like segwit and lightning network etc to solve future problems rather than hardfork at the drop of a hat. Also, larger blocks hurt decentralization by making it harder/more expensive to run nodes.

Essentially, I think first you need to define what you mean by cryptocurrency \(I know there are a lot of diverse definitions of cryptos\). When I think of cryptos, I think primarily of a crypto ""currency"", which would be a cash equivalent; Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash would fall into that category.

We also talk about tokens, and the issuance of tokens and ICOs, and those coins being cryptocurrencies in their own right. I think of those more as securities, but that plays into our vision for this new emergent token economy, where we see the digitization of real\-world assets that live on the same network or interoperable networks, which can enable more real\-time asset exchange.

I don't like to limit blockchain to being just about cryptocurrencies; I really think of it as digital asset or token\-driven economy. This idea plays a vital role in our vision for IBM Blockchain.",1526562942

AMA REPORT

No 1- PRICE

The price is a market driven mechanism. We only have control over our software, we have zero influence over the value of the market price. Binance never announces coin listings before the listing process. And they don't even inform the teams or the devs to avoid any market manipulation on the part of the teams

No 2- BCN CARD For now we don‚Äôt have any progress on the Bytecoin debit card but this is one of our future goals we would like to implement for Bytecoin. We think it is one of the biggest options that will make Bytecoin more widely spread around the world and inside the crypto community.

No 3- ROADMAP The current roadmap will be updated very soon, for other updates such as ICOs and other projects please stay tuned on our social networks to hear more.

No 4- PARTNERSHIPS Some cool partnerships are on there way, Please stay tuned we will prepare to announce that info in more detail in the future.

No 5- WEBWALLET ISSUES We are constantly working on the web wallet issues but we cannot close it for maintenance because many users use it and need access to their assets. However, the 2 main issues (2FA and refunds) are on their way to having a solution. We always recommend the desktop wallet as the safest way to store your coins but some users still prefer to the web wallet due to its convenience of not having to download the blockchain The web wallet is operating in its ordinary mode. Kindly clear your browser's cache to access it. And we will investigate if it's possible to implement a recovery key in our Web Wallet

No 6-REFUND The reason it is taking longer the refunds is we work with a third party and we cannot deal with every issue each separate time. We have to collect all of them and then conduct the refund all at the same moment.

No 7- END OF YEAR Until the end of the year we are willing to be listed on many major exchanges and increase the popularity of our coin to make it more usable and wide spread around the world.

No 8- LEDGER Support Ledger Nano It is in our plans and we are working on that. However it is not in our nearest plan.

No 9- MARKETS As of now we are talking to other exchanges in the Asian and Middle East Markets. The African Market is our main goal for the 3rd quarter. When we know more we will be happy to share it with the community.

No 10 MASTER NODE The design of Bytecoin isn't about having a master node presence, but we're investigating the plans for incentive reward campaigns for the significant network actors.

No 11 HARDFORK 1 Bytecoin Hardfork will Rescheduling, we need more time to investigate some additional technical aspects and change the order of the actions which need to be taken in the nearest time. 2 we‚Äôve reviewed our plans and have decided to switch from a ‚Äúcautiously optimistic‚Äù strategy to a ‚Äúvery accurate‚Äù one. This is a necessary measure to avoid any kind of drawbacks after the hardfork is released 3 The main purposes of the hardfork are to simplify the code, improve the P2P protocol, and introduce dynamic fees. 4 The hardfork doesn't have a direct influence on the value of the coin, but it's a major update of our codebase, which means that the whole crypto world will be monitoring the situation 5 you'll only have to be updated to the newest wallet version and import your saved *.wallet file when it's released

"Hi, last week I released chainfeed.org - a global realtime OP_RETURN feed for Bitcoin Cash blockchain, which is like a newsfeed for all OP_RETURN powered apps like memo, blockpress, and yours.org. You can see the announcement here: https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8hwr5h/ive_built_a_new_type_of_blockchain_explorer_as_a/

Today, I‚Äôm releasing Datacash, which does the opposite‚Äîit‚Äôs for WRITING OP_RETURN data to the blockchain. Here are some highlights:

1. Simple: You literally need 4 lines to post to memo.cash, blockpress, etc. And the syntax is super simple. There are only 2 methods (build and send) and everything is done declaratively. If you‚Äôre working on your own web interface or server side OP_RETURN transactions, DataCash is perfect.
2. Data-focused: Traditionally Bitcoin libraries have focused on money transactions. With yesterday‚Äôs huge upgrade to OP_RETURNs, I think we can afford to think differently about what a ‚ÄúBitcoin transaction‚Äù is. I believe we will see more and more data-focused transactions where the primary purpose is to write data to the blockchain instead of sending money.
3. Secure: I did not write the entire library from scratch, it depends on bitcoincash.js, which in turn is forked from bitcore-lib, which is one of the most stable and popular Bitcoin JavaScript libraries out there, so it‚Äôs secure. But if you find any bugs, feel free to send a pull request.

I think this ‚ÄúOP_RETURN on steroids‚Äù will become one of the defining features of BCH over BTC, and this is the main reason why I got excited and started working on BCH projects recently.

So if anyone‚Äôs working on apps related to OP_RETURNs please reach out. I‚Äôm happy to give feedback and help out if you‚Äôre running into trouble posting to the blockchain. I‚Äôm @0xAlejandra on Twitter.",1526561064

No, superior functionality is always superior.

Literally every single major alt coin out performed Bitcoin in 2017. Including ETH by a large margin. The probability of success is more than 100%, you will literally make double the money for holding almost any other coin other than Bitcoin. Doge coin beat Bitcoin in 2017. Ripple DESTROYED Bitcoin in 2017 by so much its fucking insane.

Only an IDIOT would believe Bitcoin is a good hold. Exactly like people who think ETH is a good hold now that we have EOS.

Explain to me how bitcoin cash is bitcoin,1526560377
"That's an interesting question. Here are some strategies I use:   
1. Have a %-threshold or a clear profit target for your low-market cap coins. You could set a sell-order at 3x the price in one of your core long-term holdings (may that be USD, BTC or ETH). I personally just set a range between 0,5% and 2% for my speculative holdings and as soon as it breaks out of it I either buy more or sell some to rebalance my portfolio. (This rebalance strategy does not really stop you from overdiversifying, but it forces you to think about a clear hierarchy and allocation of your portfolio. Whenever I bought too many small caps I realize: ""Oh ma Gawd - I only have 30% Ether!"" My feeling is not that people diversify too much, but that they allocate them in an equal matter. For example: 10 coins √† 10% with no regard to market cap and risk. I probably have 10-15 high-risk coins in my Portfolio but they represent only 6-8% of my total portfolio if that makes sense.)    
2. I invest a little money every month or so, but I restrict myself to 3 coins a month. This makes sure that you are actually really convinced by a coin and don't FOMO into some shit. And even if you FOMO into some scam you only invested 1/3 of your monthly budget, which does not break your neck! For a coin to become a substantial % of my portfolio it has to convince me month after month after month. Very few project have been able to do that. Whenever I think about my Top3 for the month I have to keep updated with technical developments, the current price and it often reignites my passion for older projects i support. Not sure if this really helps you, but by investing over time I am not as vulnerable to some hype, wrong judgements or an irrational mood. ",1526560334

"Crypto Assets are a new emerging asset class, and with increasing legitimacy &amp; regulation endowments &amp; pensions will put in a small % of their investments into the space. Check out the book Crypto assets to learn more.",1526560261
"&gt;I think you are underestimating the cost of having the knowledge to be able to see the potential in Bitcoin that early. Look at Hal Finney's (who was an early miner in 2009) background. He worked on PGP and build his own version of crypto before btc. Or Trace Mayer, who was doing academic research on money when Bitcoin came out.

There are plenty of people who mined them for fun and then just threw out old hard drives with hundreds/thousands of bitcoins because they didn't believe they were ever going to be valuable. The reward has nothing to do with how much you believed in Bitcoin, and everything to do with a supply schedule that exponentially decreased the supply rate of bitcoins.

If the supply rate exponentially increased over time rather than decreased then the opposite would happen, regardless of how early you got into bitcoin or how much risk you took. It's an ad hoc rationalization to try and justify artificial scarcity as some kind of risk taking reward. how much risk you take is completely separate from supply/demand, which is what sets price. The risk was lowest at the start when it only cost a few cents to make a bitcoin and the worst you could lose is a few cents a coin and you could stand to 100,000x your investment in 9 years. Now its impossible to get 100,000x your investment but you can easily lose thousands of dollars per coin, and be left with tens of thousands in specialist mining gear that is useless.

&gt;They were also somewhat lucky to be born at the right time/place for it and other things that happened in their lives. But that's just how the world works.

So it wasn't an equal opportunity for all then.

You still haven't explained how giving the highest rewards at the very start is somehow more egalitarian than just giving the same level of rewards consistently over time so that you're not at a systemic disadvantage for joining the project at a later date.

Install blockfolio and enter your holdings.  Install bit universe and sync to the eschange api.  Instructions are found wthin.

Think about if you want to sell high and bit low or just hodl.  The former is much more time intensive.  Crypto should be 5-10% of your investable assets MAX.  Conservative, 1-2%.  Dont pit any more in, even when times are great, unless your high i come in which case do whatever you want.

If you keep learning youll get a sense for when charts show a shit investment and you can do you own ta and fa and decide what suits your money dick.

Like, brad is already sitting on billions, all the ripple employees have probably cashed out enough to live forever. Not sure what problem any of them would have in reversing a tx that serves more of their purpose than propping up the illusion that XRP is a crypto. theyll just easily move to the next money grab, what does it matter to them? You and I lose, like always.

&gt;Because the needed trust

Not really. It's solving the problem of liquidity. Trust between FI's was never an issue of some crypto facilitating it. Meryll Lynch and Bank of Japan can chose to use one of their own tokens for settlement too, if they'd agree to do it with XRP. If you think xrp is trying to solve the trust issue i think you may be thinking of bitcoin. You by definition cannot have a trustless economy on something held by a single organization with a single point of failure and too much expectations from the individuals involved to do the right thing

You're relying on *two factor authentication*? Do you know [all the times's thats failed before](https://medium.com/@CodyBrown/how-to-lose-8k-worth-of-bitcoin-in-15-minutes-with-verizon-and-coinbase-com-ba75fb8d0bac) or the [inherent security problems](https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/18/16328172/sms-two-factor-authentication-hack-password-bitcoin)

Instead of rolling your own scheme with PGP, use the already-existing method of encrypting a mnemonic seed phrase: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mnemonic_phrase#Two-Factor_Mnemonic_Phrases

I'd recommend you store the bitcoins on paper because that's the most intuitive. You could use multisignature wallets to split up control of the bitcoins over many different locations.",1526556170

"I paid the crazy-high fees to move my BTC around at Xmas time, much to my annoyance. I mined it from the start until the ASICS came in then moved to mining Ethereum and XMR. EVERYTHING that I mine now, i convert to BCH...much faster to move and never had exorbitant fees. After much burying my head in the sand, I am now a BCH convert... as far as I'm concerned, there is no longer an argument about which version follows Satoshi's model. SEGWIT = FUCKWIT.

"Yes NANO was distributed for free (and it still made the NANO creators and some faucet farmers filthy rich, no one knows who's behind the whale accounts). But the faucet was ridiculously annoying for regular users, I never received any payment at all when I tried it. No one would have really recommended the NANO faucet to his colleagues except maybe some third world countries who took this as a full time job within coordinated circles to immediately dump their coins on Bitgrail. And the faucet doesn't even exist anymore. NANO is now a serious businessy coin for paid investing only. And developers that entered the field in 2018 will probably not be able to easily fund their NANO projects. 

That's where BANANO comes into play. Introducing regular people to crypto in a playful manner, and having development funds for community projects. Go figure. It really works. It's catchy across all ages. Here's just one of the conversations I held:

Mojo
Fyi, my dad sent those. May be one of the first seniors to use bananos

renesq
did he use crypto before banano?

Mojo
no He thinks bananos is hilarious. Everytime he sees me messing with crypto, he asks me ""are we a whale yet?""",1526556091

"I doubt that there's such a study, at least with decent quality. But that has never stop me from trying.

The bitcoin network is currently consuming (in average) around [**183,939,488 KWh**](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption), according to Digiconomist, placing it right before the Czech Republic. 
**The Czech Republic has their population number around 10M.** So, according to Digiconomist, the Bitcoin network is (almost) consuming the same energy that is required to power a somewhat efficient economy with a population of 10M, in Central Europe.

Now, this energy cost by the bitcoin network has two objectives:
**1** - To create new coins at a deterministic and controlled rate.
**2** - To register new transactions in the network.

This means the Bitcoin network consumes the energy just to maintain these two objectives.
I did not put the security objective in the list, because the competition for the network hashrate to mine new coins, implements the network security as a by-product.

Traditional, banks a set of services beyond the service of managing and keeping your money safe. 
The service of just keeping your money available is pretty inexpensive, so that many banks don't even charge you for keep your money in their banks, to have a debit card and can even provide a small interest rate.

Banks also provide financial investment services, like when you want to buy a house with credit or even when you just want to evaluate how much your house is worth in the market, if you want to take a mortgage.

Now, the Bitcoin network is currently confirming around [**200K transactions per day**](https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions). The global banking economy easily overcomes that value in a single second. But still, the question remains. **How much energy does the global banking system consumes?** There's no way to know exactly, but one thing is sure. **The energy consumption of a bank will be the least as possible to keep things running, because energy is money and Banks are there to profit.**

**PS:**
You will notice that I did not talk about money printing. I did not mention that because banks do not have that capability. If you live in the EU, you would now that banks (public and private) get their liquidity from the ECB. 

*The governments from the EU countries CANNOT borrow money directly from the ECB.* This is established in the EU treaty. So for the banks operating within the EU, they cannot create new currency.

That is how traditional businesses typically work. Not everyone knows all the ins and outs to each and every business deal and exactly all the secret sauce of the business model. I think about this all the time. The crypto market is so new and everyone demands to know how it all works i.e. whitepapers ..

"This post :

/u/gypsytoy: I don‚Äôt seem to be coming back. I basically have the same story as OP except that I went from investing everything I had (as a college student) to buy 60 BTC in 2013 and holding strong for a solid 4 years. Then having a mental health crisis during 2016 and giving 20 BTC away to strangers online who took advantage of me, never to be seen again. Then in December, days before the top, I learned what margin trading actually was. Mad a tiny bit. Lost a good amount while falling asleep during a drop and then chasing the whole thing (40 BTC) down to 0.02 BTC. I‚Äôm beyond devastated. I‚Äôm confident that I‚Äôm going to end my life over this and I‚Äôve already begun separating myself from the world and getting my affairs in order. I feel weird revealing and admitting this on reddit, but this post hits home, as does the one of the main sub about the guy‚Äôs brother who killed himself over the same situation. I admire those who can weather setbacks of this kind but I‚Äôm not one of them. I knew from the minute I read the white paper that Bitcoin was a game changing idea. I poured my savings into it, confident that my stack would be worth a million (20K) within 5 years (I called this almost perfectly). It‚Äôs not even like I want to live an extravagant lifestyle, I just wanted to feel financially safe for once in my life and wanted to share the wealth with those close to me and help build positive businesses and a better world. The pump and dumpers and Lamborghini memes are so obnoxious, as if the world needs any more mindless hedonistic consumerism. I grew up pretty poor and bounced from foster home to foster home and from school to school. I barely made it through college and have no marketable skills. I lost my dead end sales job a few months back and can‚Äôt bring myself to go back to barely getting buy. I held strong throughout the years, even though I could‚Äôve certainly used the money at times. I always brought my own lunch to work and always took the subway when I could instead of paying for Uber. I invested a few thousand dollars back in 2013 and never saw a penny of it. OP is much more honorable than me because I certainly don‚Äôt have the self respect to turn down donations but I‚Äôm also pretty certain that people aren‚Äôt donating to the small army of people who are in the same situation and I obviously don‚Äôt deserve it anyway. When I run into friends, they always ask about how well I must be doing because they know I‚Äôve been a Bitcoin proponent for a long time. Smiling and looking at them in the eye while talking positively about Bitcoin is incredibly taxing and I immediately want to throw up in the nearest trash can afterwards. I know somewhere else in the universe, there‚Äôs a ‚Äòme‚Äô who decided against margin trading or stopped after a few losses or didn‚Äôt start playing bull at the beginning of a bear market. Not me though, I‚Äôm a fool and I squandered the only thing going for me in life. I hope others heed the warnings, but I know most won‚Äôt. Either way, I don‚Äôt have the type of mind to let something like this go and I can‚Äôt stand to watch Bitcoin moon again and be left behind. It‚Äôs sad that money can have such power over people. I know many have had their lives dramatically changed for the better but I suppose there are two sides to the coin. I don‚Äôt even know why I still obsess over Bitcoin and this sub. I literally can‚Äôt think of anything else most of the time. I guess I keep hoping that it will drop to some very low amount and that I‚Äôll be able to buy back in but that doesn‚Äôt make sense because I don‚Äôt have $10 to my name to put back in.

If you are referring to the Bitcoin Cash, to my understanding, their only objective is to make the network fees ultra low in order to capture adopters without resorting to an extra layer. 

If you are talking about Bitcoin Gold, their objective was to change the hashing algorithm, in order to make it ASIC resistant. In order words, to make the development of ASIC specifically to mine bitcoin gold so expensive, that the cost/benefit would not be appealing.

They have no whitepaper. You know what a whitepaper is, right? 


The whitepaper explains *HOW THE SHIT FUCKING IS SUPPOSED TO ACTUALLY WORK*. These guys don't have that. 


What these guys have: 

- a ""vision"" 

- a ""roadmap"" 

- an ICO

- great webpage

- probably good marketing, given they already have received 24 million in funds. 




You don't see a problem here at all? They can write whatever they want, regarding how their shit is supposed to work, because at the end of the day, nobody reads the shit anyway. People hear ICO, see a nice webpage, and they're in. They don't care if it works or not, or how it works. Why would they? They don't understand that anyway. 


They want the coin to pump. 


Tech is no longer required for a coin to pump, you need marketing and that's it.

"**Gaslighting**

Gaslighting is a form of manipulation that seeks to sow seeds of doubt in a targeted individual or in members of a targeted group, hoping to make them question their own memory, perception, and sanity. Using persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, and lying, it attempts to destabilize the target and delegitimize the target's belief.

Instances may range from the denial by an abuser that previous abusive incidents ever occurred up to the staging of bizarre events by the abuser with the intention of disorienting the victim. The term owes its origin to the 1938 Patrick Hamilton play Gas Light and its 1940 and 1944 film adaptations.

Positive news these days are coming in one after the other. 

The biggest benefit from all this $ coming in would be volume. More volume , less chances of price manipulation.
Less prices volatility, and that will lead to real world adoption. 

 E.g if ebay/Amazon start accepting BTC, and have say 100mil in BTC. 
Now GOX wallet moves say 20k worth of BTC, and that crashes the market by 20%. 
How will ebay and Amazon explain to their investors that even during a profitable quarter they couldnt make their estimated numbers, because Mt GOX crashed the market, and  made them lose 20mil. 
The price volatility is the major hurdle for real world adoption. 

Also, just FYI from experience I know, no one knwos what BTC is gonna do. All these guys who TA know nothing. BTC will bull run very it is nice and ready. But, it will happen. 
Until then, just $ cost average until you have built your position.

There is another anecdote floating around that the Mt Gox coins are also being sold over the counter. The premise behind this method is these guys are coming in by stealth and setting themselves up for the long haul, behind the scenes acquiring big bags of various coins. They realise how immature the market behaves and that a single daily spend of a billion would trigger the market into another parabolic phase and spoil their buying strategy.

Sure there are issues in centralisation that need to be worked on so only big blocks isn't the right solution, but BCH isn't against sidechains either, it's just not wanting to constipate the mainchain in order to do so. In a perfect world BCH never existed and Bitcoin would have found consensus between bigblockers and smallblockers, but instead the whole market is now given 2 chains who both take extremes in their solutions; one might force you to use sidechains and have the mainchain not available to you at all and the other might end up a centralised mess with nobody able to run a node.

"&gt;No blockchain can scale without a second layer like iexec, even the projects promising hundreds of thousands or millions of tx/s (EOS, Cardano, Ziliqa, etc‚Ä¶) can‚Äôt handle computation of medium and surely not heavy tasks, they never will (with classical computing at least). 

While I'm all rooting for SONM, iExec as well as solutions for computation heavy tasks like rendering or heavy nodes for networks that are not looking for true decentralization it's a big claim to throw around.

If your network is build to run on lightweight p2p nodes where each participant is a node then no centralized / computation heavy network can ever beat the sheer amount of network-participants.

That's also the basic idea of BTC.

The only time one would require such a solution is for businesses that are looking to provide a single point of failure / entry where people can send their transactions trough - see these exchange issues with Nano. 

This is where any node will break down under heavy load (or not if you look at nanex since they have multiple nodes for that purpose). Heavily centralized networks such as NEO with very few nodes will require super computers and such networks like iExec (but that said they might provide to less power), much as IOTA might be with multiple coordinators.

TLDR: These millions of tx/s would come from hundred thousands of network participants and not from 7 nodes like NEO has.",1526546422
Yeah I've definitely noticed that. What exactly is the difference between Bitcoin cash and Litecoin by the way? Because when I look at the fundamentals of it I see sha256 vs scrypt and a 4x larger supply on ltc. They both had the idea of larger block size and more of a cash transaction coin. The part I found surprising again fairly new here is that it appears Bitcoin split. The Bitcoin cash people attempted to take over Bitcoin but did not get a consensus so they forked off on their own. I guess I don't understand why they just didn't support Litecoin and build on that. It was already there and established and pretty much right down the alley of where they went. Like that's my current area of study actually. I'm trying to figure out what's really different between those two. There's an obvious difference in management style right now with Charlie Lee being more of the liberal intellectual easy to get along with type. I like where Charlie is going with his vision and definitely support that. I like where Bitcoin is going and I definitely support that. Bitcoin cash I'm trying to kind of wrap my head around. ,1526546395
"Good on you for consolidating coins based on your beliefs, but seriously though, you want to stay at least a bit diversified.  There are lots of awesome projects out there, spread it around a bit.  Don't hold coins you think are garbage, of course, but if BCH is the only asset that catches your interest, you need to do more reading.

1. Roger is a businessman.  I don't really pay attention to anything he says, most of it seems obvious.  The real voices worth listening to are the ones having technical discussions on the future directions of the technology.  Stuff like all the new opcodes supported by BCH, and how those might be used for future projects.

2. You're asking the wrong questions here.  Trying to predict arbitrary price points is absolutely futile.  If someone ever tells you a predicted price point 6 months out etc, they're just making shit up to manipulate you.  That's the only reason to do stuff like that.

Instead, try to guage if a given asset is ""over valued"" or ""under valued"".  If all you're seeing is hype about how awesome something is, it might be over valued (sell a bit).  If there are a lot of people claiming something is garbage, but you don't think they really know what they're talking about, it might be under valued (buy a bit).  Right now there are a lot of people with a lot of money who think the entire crypto space is garbage, so by my evaluation, the entire space is way under valued, and you'll continue to see the value creeping up as more and more pf those people slowly start understanding the technology.

BCH itself has a lot of what I call ""artificial negative pressure"" from all the haters on /r/bitcoin.  As they slowly lose interest in the Roger vs Theymos drama, the pressure will dissipate, which will lead to a general rise in price.  Skepticism in the success of the hard fork the other day is also an example of negative pressure that is now lifted.  Introduction of a coin to a new exchange usually provides some significant positive pressure.  Think of every asset as being surrounded by positive and negative pressure bubbles and the price moves up and down accordingly.  This'll help you get a feel for the erratic movements you see.  It's not a simple ""up or down"" game, there are thousands of super significant factors at play here.",1526546283

"&gt;Why would I be screwed? The 2 email services are meant to serve as a back-up. As I said, I already have the word seed memorized.

Fine, though I wouldnt trust my memory with that. Its fresh in your memory now, but after a few months of not using or checking your memory of the seed, chances you will forget or misremember are very high.

&gt;This isn't true if you log out. Every log-in requires 2-factor.

I just tried. Signed out of google, signed back in. No 2FA prompt. On a new device, it does prompt me. That may be a setting, but check it first. And if its not a throw away account, you'll be logged in pretty much all the time.

&gt;Okay, does that mean that it's your family's Bitcoin, or yours? 

You can organise that anyway you want. The way I did, was giving pieces of the puzzle to various family members, so at least 2 would have to collude to steal my coins. I trust each of them individually with my life, so certainly with my private key (I just dont trust them to store it, or the acces to it securely), but if you dont then you can do a more elaborate Shamir Secret Share setup, or simply put the last piece of the puzzle in your will.

&gt;And where is this puzzle written down? In a safe? Folded in a book? A safety-deposit box? This is what I'm trying to avoid. I don't want something that can be lost, stolen, destroyed... 

Anything can be lost. Your cloud storage certainly can. You can only opt for redundancy to reduce that risk.  As for being stolen, thats why you encrypt it and why I chose to add a layer of security thats extremely hard, if not impossible to breach for a random hacker, but should be solvable by someone with access to my financial statements and intimate knowledge of me, my family and our past. That eliminates 99.999% of all potential hackers.

&gt;and now in your example, gotten to work on by whoever has decided that my Bitcoin is worth figuring out the answers on this page. 

That person would need to steal the puzzle first. IE, hack the email account(s) that stores it. IF he does that with yours, he's done. In my case, well, good luck to him.

&gt;Oh, and by the way, we only need to figure out about 6 of the words, because we'll be able to brute-force the rest.

My seed is encrypted in its entirety by a ridiculously long password. A hacker could obtain 10 of the 12 answers of my puzzle and bruteforcing it will still be all but impossible.

"Does saying that I consider both forks as legitimate contenders for the ""brand"" name make me a ""bcash troll""? I hold both in equal amounts simply because I have no clue which approach will prove to be right in the end. Lots of people from both sides are pretending they already know, but I'd prefer to see data to prove it, which is still scarce. And so far both networks work as intended.

I'm also not a fan of either side claiming to be ""the real bitcoin"". The original Bitcoin is dead, both current approaches are quite different from Bitcoin in 2010. 

And several weeks to understand the difference? Come one. One has increased the blocksize first, the other is betting on scaling on the second layer first. It's quite a simple distinction.",1526545301

Bitcoin will keep working as designed

"There's a governance board for this, listed on the main page of bitcoinabc that I guess you haven't read before:

&gt; Decentralized Development - With multiple independent teams of developers providing software implementations, the future is secure. Bitcoin Cash is resistant to political and social attacks on protocol development. No single group or project can control it. The bitcoin-ml mailing list is a good venue for making proposals for changes that require coordination across development teams. Workgroups have been set up to assist developers to coordinate and seek peer-review. For those wishing to implement changes to the Bitcoin Cash protocol, it is recommended to seek early peer-review and engage collaboratively with other developers through the workgroups.

Have people always been expecting the floor to fall? I realize we've been in a 5-month downtrend and that is going to wear on some people but I'm really curious about that. It seems like the crypto space attracts a lot of skeptics and negative personality which I definitely don't like but if it's a common theme at least I can understand it. I wasn't able to tell if it has been caused from the five-month downtrend or if it's something that's been going on for years,1526543832

BTC will suffer the same unintended consequences of the change in design, there is no way around it.

"Honestly, that's not helpful.  For those of us who have been around a long time and watched it all unfold, it's obvious what's going on.  For people just starting to look in to it, the very concept of a cryptocurrency is new and strange.  They've got no basis for reference when the bcash trolls spam their rhetoric.  Sure, it's clearly toxic troll\-speak most of the time, but a lot of what is written here about bcash is also clearly toxic troll\-speak sadly enough.

The fact is that most people don't spend a lot of time reading a lot about every little thing they come across.  If they don't know that bitcoin is important, they won't take the time to learn.  Once they do realise it ""might"" be important, they'll do the bare minimum to inform themselves.  Under these circumstances, a lot of the conversation here on reddit looks like two sets of monkeys flinging their faeces at each other.

"You about a hundred words and didn't manage to make a single point. I'm interested in all platforms and am a maximalist for none but want to see the truth. By ""for free"" it means it can achieve scale without ruining what this is all about, an open network that anyone can participate in. Do you know the price EOS has paid to get the simple increase in tps? It's not any new tech it's merely limiting participants to a few masternodes of a consortium chain which require supercomputers, and removing Merkle proofs so a regular user can't even audit transactions themselves which opens all sorts of problems.

There is an extreme reliance on voting for delegates, if that goes wrong then everything with EOS fails and there are lots of problems with it. Without any incentive very few users will vote, very few will even know what it means or how or who the delegates are. With very few voters exchanges holding most of the coins will dominate voting. Regular users will effectively have no say so voter incentives are not aligned with users.

Requiring owning a lot of tokens to be allowed to make any transactions means anyone who wants to use the network has to be exposed to crypto volatility, poor people won't be able to make txs,  when users suddenly want to make a lot of txs quickly they won't be able to, one off users will have a large barrier to entry and so on.

To go with a simple method of increasing tx/s EOS has paid a massive price, it will be less safe with worse usability. Ethereum will scale without making those sacrifices (""for free"") through better research. You really shouldn't back a single option unless you understand both sides or write eth off if you don't understand its plan for scaling without suffering dangerous such tradeoffs.",1526542757
"No it's not going to be a problem because preventing whales from holding all coins was a major design goal for coin distribution. Honestly, everything is designed so perfectly well with Skycoin and there is a reason for everything. Synth has said that currently no one single person holds more than 1% of the total supply. This is NOT the case with ETH or BTC. 

The purpose of Skywire is to distribute the coin as fairly as evenly as possible. Instead of providing ""useless"" resources in the form meaningless computation like PoW, you contribute bandwidth and in return you get Skycoin. This is a rough analogy. I said ""useless"" because obviously depending on which camp you are on, we can debate that point forever since this is the PoW v.s. PoS debate. 

For every Skycoin you hold, you get one Coin Hour per hour. This means that While Skycoin has a limited supply, Coin Hours is actually inflationary at the most fundamental level. This is designed ON PURPOSE to promote spending and actually shifts all the utility of being a currency onto Coin Hours while Skycoin can remain a ""money printing press"" and act as a store of value. 

This is a really ingenious way to promote spending and increase transaction velocity. The goal is to generate REAL economic activity. In Bitcoin, only a tiny fraction of people are genuinely using it for actual economic activity. Most people are not willing to spend it because of the crazy volatility and speculation. 

By having a two token system, you get the best of both worlds. 

At the same time, when we say ""free transaction"" with Skycoin, it actually means you pay with 50% of the unspent output of Coin Hours (this number can be changed). And when you send Skycoins, 50% of the outspent output of Coin Hours are burned. This reduces the overall supply of Coin Hours. 

So there are mechanisms that both increases (at a fixed rate) and decreases (a function of transaction activity and a few other mechanisms) Coin Hours. In the end you get a self-adjusting equilibrium that will inflate when there is low activity (promote spending) and deflate with increasing activity. ",1526542739

"At some point Bitcoin will have to increase the block size. Even with Lightning, opening and closing channels at some point of adoption will be too much for the current block size and fees would be prohibitive.

The key here is ""at some point"" and understanding that:

1\- There is a tradeoff between increase block size and centralisation

2\- Block size cannot scale forever

If we think of a world where 1 billion people are using Bitcoin, if they do 2 two transactions a month that means 772 transactions per second, which means already more than 500mb block.

But that's 2 transactions in a month! With Lightning \+ 500mb blocks those people could just do the opening and closing transaction and use Lightning for all the rest. Even better, the size of the block could be lower as there would be no need to settle all transactions in the blockchain, eventually people could just use Lightning.

Now let's imagine what would happen to those who pretend to only scale via blocksize increase, let's say people use Bitcoin to do 5 purchases a day so 150 transactions per month. That's 57,870 transactions per second. Good fucking luck with that! To handle Visa\-like transactions \(2000 per second\) the size of the block should be 1GB already. Which means they now need 29 GB blocks. And what if instead of 1 billion we have 3 billion? We need 173.000 transactions per second. But what if people are actively trading Bitcoin and institutions as well? What if the 5 transactions per day are way more?

You can't win this game. So obviously it is easy now ""let's just increase the block size"". But if we don't investigate second layer solutions and only do the boring scaling solution at some point we will be trapped.",1526541914

"I personally think it's exactly the right balance.  There needs to be a stake associated with decision making.  Actually I would argue it's a lot more decentralized than Bitcoin is, as it still has miners, but masternodes can serve as a check against miner centralization.  Masternode shares will eventually be implemented and distribute the network even farther.  I would love it if there were some other DAO models, but all the others I know of are basically just Dash with some fairly superficial tweaks or something from another coin slapped on.

What the Dash DAO has show is both a willingness and ability to change direction and implement new concepts, and has done so with relatively few issues or consensus problems.  It seems very likely that it will be able to continue to adapt.  That's the big issue I have with Bitcoin Cash.  What happens the next time consensus is unclear?  Another 2 year stagnation followed by a hostile forking?  I think it's a bit naive to think it's all solved smooth sailing from here on out.

I don't really understand the argument for Dash being more centralized.  It still has miners.  

I don't know if lightning will be viable or not, but if it is the same thing can be done on other coins and it doesn't solve any of the consensus issues.  Dash doesn't need it.  I have done the math on what it would cost to run a masternode if Dash had VISA level transactions and even at current hardware / bandwidth prices keeping transaction prices below a penny would not be a problem.  I don't know why the Bitcoin Cash crowd doesn't at least pick up the idea of paying nodes something.  I tend to agree that hardware cost to performance will dramatically out pace the growth of the ledger in the long run but they could dispel any concern about that by simply forking over a few percent of the block reward to nodes.

Easy as a credit card?  Bitcoin was already easier than a credit card.  I cringed when the fees went up and I had to go back to typing in all that crap to buy every $2 game I wanted to pick on up on steam.  What could be easier than snapping a qr code and clicking send?  Dash even does it instantly.  The only way it could be faster and easier is if it could read your mind and do it for you.

Time will tell how well the DAO functions.  Personally the DAO is almost as important as the currency it'self.  I could see that type of organization eventually replacing many of the current corporate and government institutions.  I wrote a blog about it a while back: [https://efoblog.quora.com/Digital\-Autonomous\-Organizations](https://efoblog.quora.com/Digital-Autonomous-Organizations)",1526541220
