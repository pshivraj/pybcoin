"&gt; &gt; In what way(s) would you say BCH works more than how BTC works?

&gt; Not entirely sure what you're saying here and I don't think OP ever claimed that.

That line is unclear precisely because I quoted OP’s title almost verbatim. He stated that:

&gt; “Someone who has read and understands the Bitcoin Whitepaper, understands how Bitcoin Cash works more than how Bitcoin (BTC) works.”

And I asked him to explain in what ways. 

More generally I’m asking people to raise the tone of discussion a bit. Lots of posts I’ve visited recently consist of OP saying something that boils down to “BCH is great” or “BTC sucks”, followed by a dozen comments along the same lines. 

There’s no value in those discussions. There’s no actual content, and that leads to no actual discussion.

&gt; I would have been more interested in your post if you had elaborated on why what the OP was saying about BCH following the whitepaper better than BTC was irrelevant because the specific ways that BTC deviates from the whitepaper reflect a superior approach to BCH and here's why.

That’s the thing. People constantly assume I’m arguing in favour of Core. I’m not. I’m just not going to let it slide when people sling vague criticisms without any sort of evidence or specifics.

You’re saying that I could have written a more interesting and well argued point, which is exactly what I asked OP to do. Let’s hope there are some better discussion threads in the future.",1522738668

"Not really, other then the hijackers themselves (and their victims) you won't find many Bitcoiners from between 2008 - 2011 that if they are still interested in Bitcoin are with Bitcoin Core.

I would say 80 - 90% of the active people in Bitcoin in the early years are either not active anymore, active in crypto like Ethereum or are with Bitcoin Cash. ",1522738625

"Verge sets up a ""crowdfunding"" event asking the community for essentially $3million in donations to announce a HUGE partnership, the largest in crypto history (their words). They promise to drop the name on 3/26/18 if the goal of $3million was reached.

"I think you can debate that.  
For maximising gains, HODL is pretty much always the wrong move in theory. With every trade you make the statistical risk of making an unfavourable one increases though, mainly because there are some factors you cannot control. To stick with your VEN theme, nobody saw that bithumb listing coming, so anyone daytrading away trying to catch a &lt;33k low to enter in VEN again would get burned.  
Some trades are relatively predictable, like the pump pattern from the listing we saw yesterday. You can make a profit there with relatively low risk (for crypto standards).  
If you are an unexperienced or very emotional trader however, the chances of fucking up are pretty big so HODL might just be the most profitable for you personally.",1522738023

"History of repeated boom and bust is an optimistic signal.

"**Charitable gift annuity**

A charitable gift annuity is a gift vehicle that falls in the category of planned giving. It involves a contract between a donor and a charity, whereby the donor transfers cash or property to the charity in exchange for a partial tax deduction and a lifetime stream of annual income from the charity. When the donor dies, the charity keeps the gift.

The amount of the income stream is determined by many factors including the donor's age and the policy of the charity.

"I would have to look into the situation more, but I would imagine after visa made there decision/announcement, the business then seeked alternate payment processors who also turned them down, and found it difficult to get proper licenses/insurance which also played a role. Above all, being transparent probably would have avoided any ""fiasco"" and definitely giving money back to people (i don't know if they did or not). 

Your mistake is trusting the core developers. You should not trust anybody. You shouldn't trust the people who develop bch either. This is a trustless system. The code is open source for anyone to study and submit improvements. Its even open to change, such as bch, who took the codebase of the group who you feel misled you. 

Congrats on taking a break from social media. I'm not on any social media, going on 8 years now. Best decision I ever made. This reddit account is the first social media account I have made. It is always best to get information straight from the source, reading the opinions of 100 different people does absolutely nothing. Read the documentation, look over the code, and use the product to base your decisions. 

I think we got a pretty fair shake at the way things played out. Regardless of whether or not you believe the points laid out against increasing the blocksize, there was a significant portion of the community that would have continued the original chain if core hard forked a blocksize increase. 

With bch handling the hardfork we didn't have a splitting of the bitcoin community, and we got free money, and we got a hedge if lightning doesn't work. its really a best case scenario

You state, ""0.4 beta is not essentially brand new, its been in development for 3 years"".  This statement is misleading at best. Firstly, the devs are writing a new protocol that is being deployed to a network with over 100 billion dollars in market cap. They have to find every security vulnerability there is and patch them, and they have to make it usable. The lightning network is not even in a state right now where it is recommended to be used for transactions. Based on my experience, it is going to take 1-3 years of continued development til the concept is fully working. And i've also said this before, this is a marathon not a sprint. Mainstream adoption is not coming soon either. Everybody has to keep improving the protocol, of ALL coins , and letting everything grow organically.

At this point it doesn't feel worth it to debate the 3 points, but you seem well read so I will.

""the required bandwith to run a full node would cause it to be more centralized""

- Nobody can predict the future, but it is logical to assume that increased bandwith will lead to increased costs. Increased costs will lead to less full nodes being run. Less users participating in securing the network, the more centralization occurs. Common rebuttals to this are ""data centers are meant to be miners, full nodes don't actually contribute anything"" to which my reply would be, there are valid scenarios in which one would seek to run their own full node. If you are so worried about those who are unbanked, running a full node would be cost prohibited to them first.

""a hard fork of this type has not been done post satoshi and it was too dangerous""

- this is just a continuation of the first reason. the major concern as I understood it was the centralization of mining. bitcoin mining is already more centralized than it should be, and creating conditions to increase this centralization shouldn't occur

""increasing block size is only a temporary solution and segwit will lead to a full solution""

- agree to disagree, sound good? all 3 of those reasons boil down to centralization concerns.

People keep making this horrible DOGE comparison, but DOGE hasn't seen a single commit in 3 years, and is not a real currency that is trying to gain additional adoption.  It is merely a meme coin, but it has been around a while, and people find it funny, so they use it for trivial things... at least I assume they are trivial since merchants don't support it.

However, the Bitcoin Cash community is actively engaging businesses and merchants. People can say what they want, but BCH has experienced the fastest growth of any new coin, with rampant exchange adoption and a huge variety of wallets. Adoption on the business side has also been very positive and is tracked at https://acceptbitcoin.cash

Literally all the major crypto companies have added support for BCH. Do you see Bitpay supporting DOGE, I didn't think so.

Comparing something like BCH to DOGE just shows your biases. Maybe you should consider actually looking at what BCH is doing rather than spouting nonsense to downplay the growth BCH has experienced.",1522736065

"&gt;No-one has given me a viable reason to use Bitcoin that doesn't require a near pathological fear of society, or worse, libertarianism. 

My friend lives in a non-western Country, he bought into Bitcoin around 100USD with more than 200,000USD. He cashed out a lot of it above 15,000USD for the first time and is a multi millionaire. 

However, if he cashes out the rest where does he put it? This was his question to me, he can buy gold - but if gold correlates with Bitcoin and Bitcoin has more upside. He can buy stocks, but US stocks have 30% taxes on dividends for outside the US, he can buy property in his country but the economy is not that great so he could end up losing money there. He could cash it out to US dollar and hold it in his Bank account pending a new found investment but the Country could have issues like Cyprus and take all the deposits above 100k USD or he could cash it out and try to store it as dollars in his house knowing that if he ever needed to leave the country it would be impossible to take the money with him across borders.

I then asked him, if you wanted to buy stocks or any investment first you would cash it into your bank account right? Yes, he said. So I asked him what made him think his bank would allow him to send millions of USD out of his Country? This was the point he told me the obvious, holding it in Bitcoin was his only option as he had no use for the money. If it goes up or down is less risk than touching it.

"I agree with you that many charities squander money or outright hoard it and that just reinforces the truth that blindly throwing money at a problem won't solve it.  On a similar vein, if one does donate to a charity then it's important to choose what you believe to be the best use of your money.  If someone simply donates blindly that indicates to me that charity to them is just a feel good gesture.

That being said, I firmly believe that we have a moral obligation to share our resources with those who are in need.  The fact that there will always be negative consequences to human actions does not negate the fact that we can greatly lessen the suffering of others at a negligible cost to ourselves.  $10 a month is probably trivial to most of the people reading this but that could easily make a life and death difference to someone who can be reached by a charity organization.  Whether that directly goes towards food and shelter or helps fund efforts to combat disease, an amount of money so trivial as to not even count as a sacrifice can literally save lives.  If you can save a life at no cost to your happiness or well being then I believe you have a moral obligation to do so.

Come to think of it, cryptocurrencies might be an effective way to ensure that charitable donations are actually used as they should be.  Being able to track the money through the blockchain would allow for the kind of transparency that charity organization should have.  (I know that there are charities that accept bitcoin but I haven't looked into any of them.)  The need for intermediaries could be greatly reduced, increasing the portion of donations that actually go towards the services vs the expenses of running the charity.  I think if people had greater confidence that the money they donate is used in the way that they want it to be used then many more people would donate.  Cryptocurrencies could make a huge difference in that regard and better enable human generosity.",1522733987

&gt; Considering the majority of Bitcoin market gains are condensed into a small number of days each year, Lee recommends that holding is the most potentially profitable option.

&gt; The predictions from Fundstrat may well encourage many to HODL, the now infamous typo of a frantic trader&amp;#039;s appeal to hold on to Bitcoin, that has become the mantra of Bitcoin enthusiasts.

Oh and your Schnorr example only underlines my point: If that few people in a given Bitcoin community know of Schnorr, then that community is not informed.  Developers are fascinated by it right now.

That is why I bring up how ACTUAL change happens in the Bitcoin Network - Stakeholders signal which upgrades they support.  Those actual stake holders voted in the majority to forego a hardfork because it WOULD NOT solve scaling issues sufficiently to warrant the risks it would require.

With regards to your concern of Transaction fees: Segwit + batching IS working as intended (fees are now lower than many altcoins).  If another Spam Attack happened (Like in November 2017), then it would indeed raise fees; but no where near as much as before.  It is impossible to quantify what fees would be for sure though. 

&amp;nbsp;

But to get to your initial focus: I think this community is a good place to go to for stirring up discussions and gauging the temperature, but I haven't seen any indication that consensus opinions around here push change.  The reality is that people around here parrot what their favorite Bitcoin Youtuber tells them, and a lot of youtubers are saying Segwit/lighting are awesome lol.

&gt; predatory student loans,

No one is forcing you take out those student loans.  There are other options besides getting a degree feminist dance therapy.  What really confuses me is that students complain about predatory loans from banks, but aren't protesting the college book stores selling them $500 text books.  The banks aren't setting the prices of those books the universities are.  Books aren't even needed and they could be distributed via free pdf files.  yet students aren't even protesting cutting down trees to print the books.  It's as if universities somehow get a free pass against any sort of criticism.  This misplaced anger at the banks when it should be at the schools amazes me.

&gt; inflation-level minimum wage

These $15/hr minimum wages are popping up everywhere.  

&gt; The only thing this generation has going for them is access to weird loans.

100% false.  There are lots of alternatives besides an overpriced and totally worthless college education for most majors.

&gt; take some of that loan and invest in Bitcoin

"&gt; Can you explain how like-kind exemptions could affect LN transactions

That was a half-complete thought on my part. I don't think they will, almost certainly not under the clarified rules. Most transactions performed by intermediaries should be nearly tax neutral - BTC come in one channel and go out the other. Fees would probably be considered taxable income/revenue. Where like-kind transactions _might have_ been applicable before the new policy is when intermediaries perform a cross-chain swap while relaying a transaction. Under the 2018 rules, to my understanding, there isn't much chance of having those be considered like-kind, and thus it would be a taxable event. That throws in a complication as rates would have to account for the intermediaries' tax liability.",1522732313

"Well, here's the thing. I *could* write out a huge spiel on why you're very wrong, but it would cause nothing but a back-and-forth circle jerk between as I can only explain so much. Aside from that, there is far too much information for me to translate over to you so I instead suggest you to do some thorough research into the technology aspect of crypto, and less of the currency aspect of it. 

But I do want to go over some of the things you said.


&gt;Tell me why bitcoin is a good buy at $5k-$7k.

&gt; It is not, nor ever will be, an adopted and functional currency.

Plainly put, if you do not believe that bitcoin or crypto will ever be adopted, then it does not matter what the price of bitcoin is or ever will be - assuming you're investing based off the fundamentals.

&gt;It cannot handle demand nor scale to meet it


You need to realize that crypto and blockchain is still a new technology that has a *lot* of work left to be done. It is no where near what it should be. That said, yes, there *are* scaling issues for a lot of the coins out there (bitcoin, eth, etc) - but who says they can't be fixed? If you've kept up to date with news, you would know that the lightning network is doing a great job as scaling bitcoin. It is much quicker and fees are down to *cents*. As for ethereum, there are numerous scaling solutions in the works. Plasma will allow it to scale to millions of tps and aside from that, chainlink, POA and other projects are working on ethereum's scaling issue as well. Also be aware that what we have now could be different than what we have later. It was just yesterday we were just dealing with peer-to-peer currencies. Then the next day ethereum developed smart contracts and changed the game. And now we have blockchain 3.0s that can scale to thousands and thousands of tps (nebulas just released their mainnet and is the first blockchain 3.0 asfaik). The technology is improving at a rapid speed. 

&gt; In the recent months adoption of Bitcoin has actually reversed and large merchants no longer accept it even as a payment.


Yes bitcoin was getting far too expensive to continue offering it as a payment method (fees were upwards of $10) - but as I said above, lightning network has made that issue a thing of the past and it is quite possible those companies who originally cut it out are just not aware of it yet.


&gt;It is controlled by a very small group of early miners and the core dev team.

You're basically arguing that it is far more centralized than people believe it to be, correct? I agree. But instead of one big power controlling bitcoin, it is numerous powers all around the globe. Bitcoin is not here to fix the gap from the rich and the poor - it's here to cut out the middle man that is banks. It's here to make sure that your money is *yours*. There is nothing that could be done to prevent richer people from holding a bigger stake of it because they have the ability to manipulate markets and simply put, buy more.



All this aside, **please** look at the technology *behind** bitcoin and crypto. Blockchain technology is not just changing the finance industry, but almost every industry it can be applied to. The way we track things, the way we store things - whether it be money, data, etc - is all being improved upon via an immutable trustless ledger.

This might be a shitty argument, but just look at what the big guys are doing. Almost every single person or company that has talked down on this new technology has done an entire 180 on their opinion. Does it go back to what I said about them just not understanding what blockchain actually was? Who knows. But with companies like IBM, massive banks and **world governments** acknowledging and working to incorporate crypto with themselves - it shows *something*. 


Whether bitcoin or *any* crypto gets adopted or not, the technology is staying no matter what. But if you believe in the latter, then there is absolutely zero reason to not believe in cryptocurrencies seeing mass adoption because, face it, crypto is - at the moment - the best and only use of blockchain right now, and very likely for the future too.",1522731641

As we know, those tokens will have a value and the better job done the value of those should increase.

For example, to participate quite often people need to register weeks in advance and provide their financial statements and bank account details - to stop winning bids not paying. With ACG the goal is to give access by putting some crypto currency up as a security. ArtChain Global will also extend the use of ACG so there is a common currency that art can be bought and sold with and not only art world supplies will be available using ACG but events and memberships will be available using it. That won’t completely replace the fact people can pay for art with fiat or other means... but it’s a way to engage the ArtChain Global ecosystem and invest in its future.

"Miner centralization means hashpower centralization. 

Recognizing that non-mining clients do nothing to decentralize or secure the network isn't supporting miner centralization, it's facing reality. 

Proof of work, not proof of warm body running a piece of software. 

Competition, skin in the game, **incentives** - not everyone gets a free vote just for showing up.

&gt;The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making. **If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone able to allocate many IPs.**

Was Satoshi pro-miner centralization? Proof-of-IP or UASF - now there's a way to guarantee centralization. Bitcoin works precisely because it harnesses competition and greed, not charity and ""full node"" feels. 

The brilliance of Bitcoin's design incentivizes miners to compete and cooperate to best satisfy stakeholders and thereby increase the value of their mined coins, and to interconnect in a configuration so tightly and directly that it approaches the theoretical maximum possible robustness for a network, enabling secure 0-conf and stability at very high capacity. The bigger the blocks, the stronger these incentives get and the harder the network gets to attack.

Meanwhile a limp &amp; loose mesh of non-miners leach off the network by pretending to be mining, thinking they're helping ""relay"" blocks between miners without realizing that every significant miner already has a blazing fast direct connection with every other significant miner. 

At large blocks this will be even more true. Your sockpuppet ""node"" could try to keep up, but this ""guardian of the network"" roleplaying charade will come with an  industrial-sized internet bill.

Crypto moves together because investors treat it as a high-risk high-yield speculative market.

Not to mention that without Bitcoin's market infrastructure those billions of dollars would likely have stayed in the dollar markets instead of the crypto markets because it is still the primary on-ramp for dollars.

Bear markets happen because of psychology and a whole world of factors outside of crypto. They're also an essential part of a healthy business cycle, so if you find yourself lashing out at other people and other projects: you've probably taken on too much risk.",1522727298
"What made me miss many opportunities since I came to crypto was the ignorance and being misled by comments on reddit. Then I learned to read deeper into the projects and compare team's project plans and ideas and see if I agree or not with their agendas.

To explain this to the newcomers and currently misled people. NEO will become decentralized in the future. Right now is centralized because it is way easier to upgrade protocols on the network, fix bugs... and so on! And guess what, NEO can't be forked so we save ourselves all the fork dramas and fight between Miners and Devs (Anyway NEO aint mineable, got the Eco-Friendly Stamp).

By having NEO, you become owner of the blockchain, 1 NEO represent a vote, votes will determine the future evolution of the Network. So if you are thinking NEO is centralized, a dictatorship tagged as ""Ethereum of China""... you got it all wrong. Haters yell ""Centralized"" yet is a real democratic project where people have the power to decide! That is why, ignorance will cost you more than 5 DIPs.

"Charges applied by SEC for CTR Token can only be a good thing for crypto to shake out the scam coins and stop it happening in the future.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday laid charges over a fraudulent cryptocurrency fundraiser that boxer Floyd Mayweather and rapper DJ Khaled touted on social media.

Neither celebrity is accused in the scheme which the SEC said raised more than $32 million from thousands of investors.

The SEC charged Sohrab ""Sam"" Sharma and Robert Farkas, co-founders of Centra Tech. Inc., with violating the anti-fraud and registration provisions of US securities laws.

Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) have sprung from nowhere to become a hugely popular way for start-ups to raise funds online, offering self-created digital ""tokens"" or coins to any willing buyer.

But regulators around the world have warned of the risks of fraud, the volatility of virtual currencies and the lack of clarity on what a ""token"" represents.

Sharma and Farkas are accused of masterminding a fraudulent ICO in which Centra offered and sold unregistered investments through a ""CTR Token.""

The charges, filed in New York, also say the pair ""claimed that funds raised in the ICO would help build a suite of financial products,"" such as debit cards that would allow users to instantly convert hard-to-spend cryptocurrencies into legal tender.

In reality, there was no relationship with legitimately-backed debit cards, the complaint alleges.

Centra ""sold investors on the promise of new digital technologies by using a sophisticated marketing campaign,"" an SEC statement said.

""The defendants relied heavily on celebrity endorsements and social media to market their scheme,"" Steve Peikin, co-director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, said in a statement.

""Endorsements and glossy marketing materials are no substitute for the SEC's registration and disclosure requirements as well as diligence by investors.""

The value of ICOs exploded last year when investors poured $3.6 billion into 228 projects, up from $96 million for 46 ICOs in 2016.

The gold-rush fever surrounding ICOs partly stems from the soaring success of bitcoin, and firms issuing ICOs have raised their visibility by enlisting celebrities.

Participants bet that the value of their ""tokens"" will go up and that they will eventually be able to trade them for established cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum, which can in turn be exchanged for traditional currencies.",1522726693

"Crumpled.  (""The likely 'hood' of a complete crash"")

For Bitcoin to go to 0, There are three possibilities I can think of.  The first one is that governments and banks might successfully stamp it out completely, putting HODLers in jail and cutting them off from the internet, etc. (And this would have to be a coordinated global effort, because any country that doesn't participate becomes the center of Bitcoin).

A second option is that the security of Bitcoin is broken, and it doesn't store value anymore (because it could be trivially stolen).  If this were to happen quickly, there may not be time to react and improve the protocol and consensus rules before Bitcoin dies as a currency.

The third possibility is that something undeniably better comes along: more private, more scalable, more convenient.

So to sum it up, not very likely.  Simple market dynamics won't and can't drive bitcoin to 0, because there are people who find value in bitcoin separate from any exchange.  Satoshi selling all his coins at once could crash the market almost arbitrarily low, but eventually people would buy them all and the price would begin to recover.",1522726651

"A paper wallet provided by the machine would constitute a check, but not an account. This is a fine line.

A phone wallet is too generic. Do you mean the company provides software that says you have bitcoin, but the business actually owns the funds (i.e. coinbase app). Most mobile wallets are private wallets and many operators specify to only use private wallets with their machines.

We might regard bitcoin as currency around here, but the united states and many other countries regard it otherwise. Specifically it is ""[intangible] property"" in the united states, so when sold it is a ""thing"" not currency being exchanged or transferred. This brings in the discussion of what an ATM is. It allows you to interface with an account held with an institution, a BTM sells concurrency.

As it stood a few months ago, increased fees put you ahead in the que but didn't produce incentive for larger blocks*.  This was essentially the same scenario as a monopoly/cartel where supply is intentionally limited and showed similar economics.

*Perhaps it should be technically said that it didn't produce sufficient incentive to switch due to lack of competition accessible to many users due to low merchant acceptance for most alt coins.

Bitcoin can already scale much larger than that with existing hardware for a fraction of the cost.  It never really hits a scale ceiling.  If you're interested, I can go over the ways it would cope with extreme size.
 
&gt;By Moore's Law, we can expect hardware speed to be 10 times faster in 5 years and 100 times faster in 10.  Even if Bitcoin grows at crazy adoption rates, I think computer speeds will stay ahead of the number of transactions.

Crypto You Tubers hardly mention it and if they do, its in an “eye-rolling” sort of way or with a chuckle.

Downvotes are handed out like candy to people who show even the slightest skepticism or disrespect towards the project.  Aside from the people and the bickering, the token trx is what it is. It normally seems to toggle between 14th and 15th place in terms of market cap.  The haters keep saying its going to disappear and the lovers keep saying its going to top 5 (i think it is 12 or 13 currently).  Who knows?? One thing that nobody can deny is that it is always in the top 5 trade volume on Binance which means a lot of people and bots are buying and selling the shit out of it.

"Disagree, first seen should always be the only valid transaction.  Bitcoin is a small world network, so there will always be a first scene.

In the very unlikely chance that two transactions were both seen at the exact same time (not very probable) then the miner would likely choose not to include either transaction out of fear the block would be orphaned.

In the more unlikely chance that this would happen often, miners would for sure not include either transaction in the block out of fear of orphan because they would potentially lose a ton of money.  Users would no longer try to cheat the system, out of fear of waiting hours or days for a confirmation.

"I accept and appreciate the apology.

&gt; If it wasn’t my message, whose made you (appear to, at least) change your mind?

I gave thought to something that tripledogdareya said regarding the inability to use induction. While it is true that induction can be applied trivially to the top portion of the diagram (i.e. xAB), the bottom portion may be more troublesome (e.g. both xBB and xBAB may discard potential advantages that B has). It would be nice to be able to use a probabilistic approach to the whole thing (rather than rely on simulations), because then we could actually derive a formula this way to find the number that the proportion converges on with large n. That was my goal with putting this diagram out there. It wasn't meant to ""prove"" anything in particular, but rather, to begin a cooperative process of mathematical formulation. For this reason, it was intentionally ""oversimplified"". I knew the edge cases would need to be worked out, and was hoping other minds could contribute a novel way of analyzing it.

Regarding your sim. I believe you faithfully produced the results from the paper, and there is not a bug in your code, as far as I can tell. I freely admit that I jumped the gun by pointing out flaws that other people mentioned, and did not give your code much time or thought because of previous insults. The problem I have with the paper is not the results given the assumptions, but rather the assumptions (just like the problem(s) with my diagram). I think the concept of ""fair share"" is distorted by an implicit assumption that mining difficulty adjustments will make an increase in relative on-chain block proportions equal to an increase in profit in the long run. Thus, the paper, like my diagram, can be said to be ""oversimplified"".

On a separate note, I tried a few different kinds of simulations of my own in which the unfinished edge cases described in the link you mention are weeded out (by running several simulations at various lengths and reducing the variance via LLN). With this, we can actually watch the simulation converge from different directions onto the same number, and it gives a good sense of which way the particular edge cases skew the results for short trials. Some ways of modeling the problem will reward disproportionately either the honest miners or the secret miners at the end of the simulation run.

On the topic of orphaned blocks and difficulty adjustment, I still think secret mining is a bad strategy (even though the proportion of on-chain blocks can be increased). It is said that this strategy in perpetuity would result in larger rewards because it would reduce the ""apparent"" hash rate (i.e. the hash rate estimate used in difficulty calculations). Consider a secret miner using this strategy and successfully reducing the difficulty. Once a difficulty of a particular value is reached, it will be more profitable to then resume mining honestly. I haven't reasoned out every edge case here, but if difficult adjustments are included in the model, I think it is worth considering strategies where secret miners completely stop mining for an epoch and then begin rapidly mining for another epoch. This analysis would obviously be different for BCH and BTC.",1522721501
"We also have dozens web browsers but after Microsoft baked IE into the OS, it became a defacto standard.  Chrome and Firefox hard a hard time becoming competitive with that.  But what it really comes down to is accepted standards like HTML, JavaScript, CSS. If they all agree on the standards, it's a moot point. And if they don't agree, those browsers were left to obscurity.  
  
As a former miner, virtually all mining is processed via pools.  Those pools will leverage the multiple forks and distribute the load as needed to maximize profit.  Which is fine. If not a lot of activity is happening with fork1 coins then we don't need all the miners focused there.  Anyone who doesn't like this can go mine solo and as such, loses the advantage of mining pools. So only really big mining operations will be able to do that.  And they'll eventually be bought-out by the big players like Amazon and Google to mine what they need mined the most.    
  
BTC and BCash are difference because there has been no oversight trying to tie them together as the same.  ",1522721494
"&gt; It seems to argue that non-mining fullnodes secure the network by providing consensus.

It works like this... if miners collude and form a 51% cartel they can change the rules. If, however, a sizable portion of the bitcoin economy is fully validating their transactions then those miners would have nowhere to spend/exchange the coins they mined with these alternate rules. 

The lack of anywhere to spend their coins creates a disincentive for miners to try changing the rules. Thus, to the extent that economic activity is flowing through fully validating nodes, those nodes do serve as a check on the miners ability to change the rules. 

The people in this thread saying full nodes do not matter are implicitly assuming that competition between miners is enough to prevent them from forming a 51% cartel and changing the rules and thus nobody other than miners needs to run a full node. 

It's not clear if this is true or not. Especially since we've seen 90% of the hashrate sitting on the same stage at one conference. So having large economic actors fully validate their transactions creates a check that might not otherwise exist.

"Slide 1: 
- Makes an argument about how it's pointless to use USD to buy bitcoin, pay a fee, send someone bitcoin for a fee, and they sell bitcoin to USD for a fee. Fails to realize that this is early adoption, and are a LONG way off from being able to buy goods and services for bitcoin from anywhere. Doesn't make it a fraud. Valid criticism? Sure, but that's like criticizing AOL for being slow.

- Says that we are simply switching out banks for exchanges, which are just another kind of bank. Does not see that it's a neccessary stepping stone, and again we are a LONG ways off from mass adoption. This is like complaining that video will never work on the internet because they can't fit through the phone lines. He grasps that it's a problem, but doesn't grasp that it can be solved. 

Slide 2:

- Says it's easy and cheaper to use a private blockchain, and there's no need to use a bloated one like bitcoin. Fails to realize that at the heart of what a blockchain is, is a database. Of course anybody can have a database. But to have a publically maintained one, so everybody knows there is no funny business going on, is COMPLETELY different from the requirements of a private database. 

- Says code developers act as central authorities, but fails to realize the huge step forward in potential for abuse. Ok, the bitcoin core devs control the roadmap, they have significant power I will give him that. But what is the alternative? Faceless burocrats who print money at their whims with little to no oversight? Is that seriously his argument? Developers provide central control so there's no point in leaving the central control we already have? Does he not realize the gigantic leap forward it is?

- Says most the money goes to the red queens race buying mining equipment and to power companies. What about all the electricity required for the banking infrastructure as known today? What about all the rooms filled with servers worldwide powering the internet? Is there any regard for the costs of those things? Nothing is free.

Slide 3:

- Every argument is about capacity. Again, valid criticism, but fails to realize that technology can be upgraded. How old is this guy? Is he still watching black and white television? Or does he not realize how quickly technology has advanced in the last 10-20 years? Dial-up never could have supported youtube. Now we can get it wirelessly on our phones. Bitcoin can do 5 TPS right now. How much do you think it will be able to do in 20 years? How much could VISA do when it first started? Give it time.

Slide 4:

- Points out a bunch of cases of fraud, but fails to realize that fraud also exists in the regulated markets as well. Fraud is part of the markets, and this is the wild west, and people need to do their due dilligence, and if they don't they are bound to get burned. This is no different from an investment in the stock market.

"yea but for what? Like to what end?

The only way bitcoin will really make major changes to life in America and have it's stock go up is if Businesses who have debit/credit card users, can also automatically take bitcoin (for a fee like now). So how does that work? Pretty straight forward. You buy something in a store, and you have some electronic way to pay, which gets attached to your receipt, and for return purposes, they want your name, which really bypasses the whole point of crypto. I know, businesses shouldn't have to pay a fee, but they will need some computer or electronic way, and for most small businesses they will need to convert back to USD for their weekly payroll etc. 

I think eventually it will come, but it will take such a long time, that MC/VISA bank cards will always be simpler and more popular, that the sheer lack of use will cause nobody to use it (just like Apple Pay)",1522720479

"I used to play online poker to pay my bills. It had been under attack by the US Gov't for awhile. Depositing and withdrawing funds had become inconvenient so I would keep a decent amount of money online. April 15th 2011 the US Justice Department basically seized all the money on these sites.

I had already heard about Bitcoin at the time but wasn't very familiar with it. I also had a couple dummy online poker accounts that I stored money in but the had no billing or payment information linked to them. I sold those accounts to someone for Bitcoin at a great discount.

I really got into Bitcoin for a few months. I would mine while I looked for a real job. I liked the idea of the freedom from the banks and government over my finances. I had bad experiences with both. So, I would mine and see if there were ways for me to use my Bitcoin to play poker. 

I had difficulty finding a way to cash out my bitcoins. After getting 'real' job I didn't spend as much time trying to mine. I did some lite coin mining. Overall, I had basically lost my wallet and had pretty much given up on it. 

Eventually online poker rooms started accepting bitcoin. It made my funds easily accessible. I didn't need to keep large sums of money on shady poker sites and could have my money back in my bank account in a couple days. 

I had tried to find my old coins a couple times. I didn't really try until after the ATH in December. I found them in February. While it has gone down since I found them. It's really grown my love of Bitcoin. What I thought was lost money is now worth more than some people's annual salaries.

"You might also research the difference between a commercial bank and a central bank. Central banks do in fact regulate (i.e. manipulate) our fiat currencies in order to benefit commercial and investment banks, and are the reason why crypto was invented in the first place.

&gt; Central banks do not deal with customers directly. Instead, the central bank is known as the banker’s bank and controls the entire banking industry. The country’s central bank maintains deposits for the government. Government deposits funds for the purpose of providing medical insurance, social welfare, unemployment benefits, etc. Central banks offer short term loans to the country’s commercial banks. These loans are provided for banks for their overnight funding purposes and are provided at lower interest rates than the federal funds rate. Central banks offer a number of services to the federal government and other commercial banks such as clearing of funds between member banks, issuing of government bonds, payment of various social security and Medicare programs, etc.

[Central banks also play an important role in regulating the country’s monitory policy. The central bank increases or decreases interest rates, increases or decreases reserve requirements, etc. The central bank formulates banking rules and regulations and is also responsible to oversee that banking regulations put in place are being followed by conducting regulatory tests.](http://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-central-bank-and-vs-commercial-bank/)",1522717187

"But governments don't want a currency that can't be created at will. They need a dollar or equivalent. And, then you become 'anti-American' by creating something that is going against the dollar, and you will wind up quickly losing a battle.

Even if you get 50% of the people to adopt Bitcoin pay, that's 50% of the people who will ALSO have their debit card, and for that reason, people will use their debit card. Just like Apple Pay. 

Apple Pay failed because of two things: All Americans must have a government ID on them at all times or risk being harassed by the police. Because you have to have an ID, you have to have a wallet, and if you have a wallet, you could certainly also bring a debit card. The other part is because 50% don't take Apple Pay (or Amex or discover). But everyone takes MC/VISA. I don't know anyone who ONLY brings AMEX, or ONLY brings Discover for that reason. Same will be with bitcoin, except you are paying a fee to use your own money, just in a different way.",1522717006

"Zilliqa does not use a blockchain, it uses a sharding system closer to IOTA or XRB. There is no full redundancy and the network is far more vulnerable to serious disruption than Bitcoin.

It also does not use PoW verification for transactions, and the whole section about using PoW to ""identify miners"" insists it is not a permissionless mining system, which could be a point of central control.

So if you want to compare a centrally controlled, non-PoW, non-blockchain with a decentralized, fully permissionless, PoW Blockchain: the less secure, less robust, and partially or fully centralized system is always going to have better throughput.

Any crypto dev could simply make a fully centralized SQL database and use it to track balances at a rate of hundreds of thousands of tx/sec. This is not interesting nor innovative.

If you want a decentralized money system with true immutability and a fully permissionless and robust PoW consensus system you're going to want to use BCH, as neither Zilliqa nor IOTA will give you any of those characteristics due to the trade-offs they had to make to achieve their goals of high throughput, low/no fees and instant confirmation.",1522716571

"There'll be a discussion about: ""Bitcoin, Controversy over Principle"".

Soon after Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper on Bitcoin was published, Bitcoin has recorded tremendous growth with an equal amount of global interest. The Bitcoin market expanded further as major financial institutions started entering and investing in Bitcoin, leading to the creation of a futures market for Bitcoin, which implies the official integration of Bitcoin into the traditional financial system. However, the issue on scalability has been consistently controversial and eventually led to a diverge of the Bitcoin community and discrepancy in defining Bitcoin. On the one hand, Bitcoin is viewed as digital gold by emphasizing its role as store of value. Conversely, the other party believes Bitcoin is a digital currency and should be valued upon its actual usage. Deconomy will elaborate on this issue and will open the floor for intense discussion.",1522713859

"Im Chinese and have a little bit of knowledge in the recent development of China and their general viewpoint so I will attempt to shed some light for you since your question could be a point of confusion from many people.

The biggest reason China banned ICOs and trading was most likely for security reasons and to protect their own citizens, regardless of how useful the technology is you have to admit tons of ICOs are scams and thus the best way to protect citizens is a straight ban. Its very easy to control everything since its run by a totalitarian government. 

To give some context on perspective China does not despise technology which is a misconception some people have. Recently if you travel to China you could see that at least in the big cities the way of life is far more technologically advanced than anywhere else in the world with fully electrified bus fleets, a universal payment system using QR codes, and as someone mentioned the bike rental scene is on scale vastly larger than anywhere else in the world. The truth is if China wants to implement something they can do it quickly because the government has no bureacracy chains to stall progress. 

ctrtde is right on the money when he mentioned prevention of capital outflow. A problem China has right now is new money trying to launder their wealth out of the country since in China your money is technically the governments money. A big reason why Chinese international students are notorious for going around the world spending crazy amounts on homes and cars, its also a laundering effort, (I live in Vancouver I would know). Bitcoin and likewise provide anonymous methods of transporting wealth around the world thus the current ban. 

My guess is that because China always prevents the West from infiltrating their borders (think the internet ban of western sites) in favour for developing their own version of things, they might make a whole new Blockchain ecosystem that is usable in China only. I know for a fact that this tech has great usage in supply chain management (VEN, AMB, WTC) for example and as China is the biggest production exporter in the world this tech will for sure have a place. How this will be done is still speculation, I'm also guessing as well.",1522713819

"Seems very convenient to ""shut down shop"" after you get a ton of donations and point the finger at someone else.

Lightning network has already failed in my eyes. Sure the tons of videos and charts make it look simple, but it isn't behind the scenes. How is the necessity of needing watchtowers when you go offline trustless? Also, a 0.4 Beta release is not essentially brand new. It's been in development for 3 years. 

Why is mentioning a pyramid scheme lowering credibility? My point is that there are a lot of people outside of the crypto community, which are necessary for mass adoption that already consider Bitcoin a pyramid scheme and stunts like Litepay do not help the situation.

And no, I didn't know it was simple, so don't make assumptions. Core developers that I trusted at the time stated that increasing the block size was dangerous for the following reasons: 

* The required bandwidth to run a full node would cause it to be more centralized

* A hard fork of this type has not been done post Satoshi and it was too dangerous

* Increasing block size is only a temporary solution and Segwit will lead to a full solution

I was right there with you a few months ago. Then I took a break from social media and read up on the technology and formed my own beliefs without relying on anyone to educate me. Lightning network is not a solution. The only watchtower I want to be along is Jimi Hendrix

"&gt; but some of the TXs are operations instead of transactions

So on bitcoin the chain is a giant list of who sent how much to who, and a full node has to go through the entire thing before it can know what state everyone is in. 

In eth it's the same, but you can also throw on operations instead of transactions. If statements, while loops, logical comparisons, etc. And a new full node will **run through and execute all of that from the beginning of the chain** and it won't be ready to use until it's done.

Lightning network will work. It is still very very early in its development. BCH has basically positioned itself as anti-lightning, so it is in there best interest to see lightning fail, which is a bad corner to put yourself in.

I had to lookup Rube Goldberg, depending on ones understanding is how one would see it. I don't see the lightning network as overly complicated. I view it as the start of 2nd layer scaling solutions, and we will see many improvements to the design, architecture, and effectiveness as time goes on.

Bitcoin has always been helpful to me. I've always gotten an answer to all of my questions. And people are certainly using it. There is work being done on it literally 24/7. 

The fact that you even mention pyramid scheme lowers your credibility.

You did know it would be simple to increase blocksize back then. That wasn't the argument against it. Increasing it was always known to be a simple fix. The worry was how it would effect the ecosystem overall. They also stated that they eventually would raise the blocksize, just not right now because there are other ways to increase effectiveness.

Also, people will never stop being stupid. People will always invest in things like bitconnect and other scams. It is why there are FBI agents tasked with investigating fraud. It will never go away.

The purpose of decentralization, therefore, is to do away with the need of centralized systems. ie: Facebook, Google, MSM. Imagine a YouTube that nobody owned and everybody had access to that was as impossible to shut down as Bitcoin. That would be very interesting.

"I'm not 100% confident on what the link is but yeah I hear it a lot too. I have a few vague ideas why spam tx could lead to high tx fees.

Big miners accepting self generated high fee tx, (and maybe in combination with spam txs) can trick wallets trying to estimate adequate tx fees for fast transactions. If enough wallets are overestimating tx fees then it would also slightly become a self fulfilling prophecy. 

I know it's expensive but I also know Roger Ver and maybe some other people probably have a tonne of btc/bch to spend on such an attack.

Also maybe the backlog of small txs slows down the network a bit? That would reduce the total tx/s and increase fees potentially?

&gt; 2. All the numbers you are providing for LN are purely theoretical and do not reflect the current state of the network. If you want to use that standard: BCH could safely be using 1GB+ blocks at well over 4,000 TPS today, on a network infinitely more robust than LN.

Got it. What's the downside of big blocks though? And why is there always talk about big blocks. Why not use 1 100 MB block every 10 seconds instead of 1 1GB block every 100 seconds?

It's only function is trade.  Money is a far superior medium of exchange in every possible way.  As a store of value it ranks up there with junk bonds.  It is superior to currency in exactly one regard - the black market - which makes it extremely vulnerable to regulation by all the major world economies as the threat materializes.

"Bitcoin is exactly like Apple Pay, and Communism.

Hear me out.

Everyone said Apple Pay, like MySpace and Communism, will change the world we live in. Communism means we can all work less, and share in the benefits and rewards. Apple Pay means we don't have to carry plastic cards with us, and fumble with making payments. No, you can't leave your wallet at home because you need a license, and if you have your license, you better have a debit card in case someone doesn't have Apple Pay, at which point, you mind-as-well just not use Apple Pay, because you have your debit card, and using Apple Pay when you have your debit card is like people who vape publicly and think that they are somehow cool instead of being addicts. 

But this is about AOL, I mean MySpace, I mean, Bitcoin.

Bitcoin allows you to go to your job, get your paper paycheck, then go to your bank or check cashing place, and deposit it or get cash. Now, with said cash, you can buy anything, anywhere. If you have a bank, you can pay for anything, anywhere. But, to make matters even more difficult, now you have to learn and educate yourself about what a bitcoin wallet is. Imagine all the lonely moms asking their kids to help them with a BlipCoin Wallet? Already I can hear my mom calling my phone. Once you learn, you can then sign up online, giving them all your personal details and banking details, transfer money to ANOTHER account, just to purchase the SAME thing you just were going to buy with your debit card. But, now you can be cool in telling your friends you are a bitcoin owner.

My point in all of this is:

Banks are NOT going to allow Bitcoin to take away profits without a fight. New regulations will be swift, strict, and because politicians are bought with Bank Power, Crypto is headed for a bad place. 

Having an EXTRA STEP to pay for stuff you already pay for, makes zero sense. Why convert your cash to bitcoin and pay a fee? For what? To buy illegal viagra from china? I think 99.9 percent of the people won't care. 

Apple Pay again. This is just one more grab for bank power that will go nowhere.

If you never sell it for cash and btc drops to $1 you are still stuck paying that gain, unless you were to convert it to eth, which would show a loss and you could even out your gain. 

Also, they are working on tracking user addresses and will be able to identify if you buy btc low, and buy a product when btc is high.

She hid all of her money and gold in various places in her house because she knew the banks or government didn't have her back.

The main market that I think Bitcoin affects in the U.S. is remittance payments. Tons of money flows to Mexico, Guam, Peurto Rico from family members that have moved here. You'll see lines out the door at Western Union on payday. The fees they pay there are probably a week's worth of wages for the receiving end. Unfortunately, they need a way to convert to their local currency because that's all places accept where they live. Educate the immigrants and they'll educate their family.

Who says you can't run your own node? Bitcoin is permissionless. There is just no point for 99% of people to run their own node and was never the plan for them to be. If you need one for whatever reason then you are free to do so.

The difference is that I can freely join or leave the network, as a miner, as a user, as whatever I want. As a peer to peer network it has no center, no ceo, no office that can be sued, nothing. That is what makes it permissionless and trustless. 

I can't say the same about Visa or Mastercard or Bank of America. I need their permission to access their centralized systems and ledgers. I can't just set up my own Visa datacenter without their say so, unlike Bitoin where I could.

I think you're also correct in saying that usefulness is very low. But if, theoretically, there was widespread adoption, it would function just like cash as far as taxation and transaction purposes go. 

Where I would disagree with you though is that Bitcoin is not anonymous, it's psudononymous in that all transactions and balances are public(look into Monero or Zcash for truly anonymous). 

I do think that a central bank running a crypto might be plausible because it would be quickly adopted by banks. But it becomes less plausable when you realize that everything is on a public ledger and that the fed wont even audit itself. 

Bitcoin was essentially created as an alternative to the fractional reserve system.

So I'm not an expert at modern economics or Bitcoin. Also there is a ton of shit information flying around. But from my perspective the value of Bitcoin is based on the philosophy behind it. I intend to use it to buy groceries 40 years from now.

In the U.S., people haven't experienced hyper-inflation or a tyrannical regime. They'll say ""Oh that's neat"" and move onto the next thing. The dollar works for them so they don't have a need for it. Most people don't care about humanity. They care about themselves and their family. That's psychology 101 and basic game theory. 

Most of the money involved in crypto right now is because of investment opportunities and because of the unregulated market that seasoned traders can manipulate. That's why the global market cap went from $850B to $250B in a few months. The investors lost interest because they didn't get their mad gainz. They'll be back once progress is made and it benefits them again.

There's very, very few of us who actually care about the technology and its benefits. And that's fine. If you truly believe in the technology and aren't just trying to prevent cognitive dissonance because your initial investment is tanking, then it shouldn't matter.",1522708246

"## Moon Math Update

https://www.moonmath.win

### Going long 

I'm 10x long. 8x stake @7,001. 

We're in a position where the scenario bears have been trading off of is in jeopardy of being invalidated and we're near the bottom of the range where a move like that would trigger. Not planning on being able to sleep, but I'm probably going to have to leave this open longer than I want. This is a high risk high reward trade.

If bear TA is invalidated we're going to see a lot of traders, as a whole, exit the market. That almost certainly changes market composition. A large bulk of traders are probably net bearish on BTC and will stay out of the market until there is a framework they can use to trade against. That should take a long time to work up to.

Fundamentals are signalling that BTC is oversold.

Moon Math is indicating that the time is right for the market to reverse back up.

###Rainbow Chart Modifications

There's been some drift from Azop's original rainbow charts that I corrected today. This happens from time to time. We should be much closer and the charts should be easier to read. I also tightened the 2017 trend chart.

We're solidly in the green quadrant of Moon Math charts. It's a struggle to hold back the noob DCA recommendation. Still too volatile, though.

the rainbow needed to be moved up to keep it consistent with /u/azop's vision. Azop ran his rainbows from a fixed date using a fixed CDPR of around 0.333%. Sometimes he would change the CDPR. Moon Math introduced a dynamic rate based on observed price performance that pretty much always stays in that range. However, the rainbow will drift up and down from Azop's charts because it's not fixed. I'll correct the rainbow so it more accurately represents his latest chart when major drift becomes obvious or on request.

https://azopstability.com/


### Moderate ""Buy"" Recommendation

https://www.moonmath.win

Measures for volatility have not improved. I've considered downgrading the moderate buy recommendation to a hold recommendation, but you should be looking at these recommendations when you're considering your own DCA strategy. Volatility hasn't increased that much and we're still holding in a pattern that has a 65% chance of breaking down. If you're goal is to DCA through a potential dip, and your comfortable with taking initial losses, then this remains a good place to **slowly** add to a position **without leverage**. 

### Unpublished Noob DCA strategy

The noob DCA strategy has not been issued because volatility is still too high. If your grandmother has been asking about when it's time to buy bitcoin, this is not the time. There's too much risk that the floor will drop out from under us while weekly BBands are this wide in a bear market. The goal is to make noobs feel good about their investments for months, not scare them away with dwindling fiat value, or the constant looming threat of dwindling fiat value.

## LBC Weekly Global Volume
Local Bitcoin global weekly volume is continuing to keep pace with long-term trends. 1 billion USD a week by the end of 2019 is an unbelievable projection, but that's moderate to conservative based on these data.

We'll probably see these rates of adoption drop as more established and regulated platforms for exchange establish themselves internationally.

"It depends how easy the monopoly is to circumvent.

Circumventing the road monopoly is basically impossible because you can't just build an alternative road system. There can only be one road in one place at one time, and government roads are naturally built where there is most need for roads.

Other monopolies have been circumvented, like the taxi-cab monopoly. It was circumvented by apps that allowed competing taxi-cabs by exploiting a legal loophole on what counted as a taxi-cab.

Bitcoin isn't circumventing any monopoly. You can already use things like gold and silver as currency, both online and offline, nobody does though because they're not better in any way, and are deflationary which is a bad thing for the velocity and stability of a currency.

Not only doesn't bitcoin circumvent any government monopoly, its dependent on two government monopolies to even function. If the government start refusing use of grid power for mining bitcoin they can cripple proof of work with their own power, and if they start blocking banks and ISPs from having anything to do with bitcoin they can quickly make it almost impossible to use online, or even sites like localbitcoin.

Government doesn't have a monopoly on money though. You can use almost anything as money, including just straight up bartering as long as you declare it in taxes.",1522707890

"&gt;the government and banks have less control and knowledge about you.

the NSA and other government agencies, along with a host of private big-data companies are already data mining the blockchain. coin tumblers have already been compromised, as have major exchanges that had private data on a huge number of bitcoin users.

they can cross reference all this data with all the other data they're already collecting on people through surveillance and hacks.

If you're worried about people having knowledge of your transactions, using a currency that creates a publicly *immutable* available record of every transaction perhaps isn't the greatest idea.

If you're really worried about that just use cash, its already anonymous and untraceable. hastening the demise of cash by switching to an online currency with a permanent record is about as big of a backwards step as i can imagine.

&gt;Nobody can take it from you without force

A greater percentage of bitcoins have been stolen and seized than nearly any other asset class, at least 2 million out of 17 million (minus 3-4 million lost bitcoin), and thats just counting the large hacks and asset seizures, there's potentially a lot more unreported at lower levels.

And this is with bitcoin not being illegal in most of the world (just using bitcoin to evade taxes and break laws). If governments actually cracked down on it they would have no problem obliterating it.

""but those were just people who stored their bitcoins insecurely, if they had stored them securely then they wouldn't have lost anything, bitcoins cryptography is unbreakable"" / ""those were just weak people who gave up their bitcoin to cut a deal with the government, they never had to give up their bitcoins""

All sufficiently high level cryptography is unbreakable at present. cryptography is never the weak link. All major e-commerce is secured with cryptography just as strong as the cryptography that secures bitcoin. 

It's a fantasy to say bitcoin is more secure than other forms of payment because of ""cryptography"" and ""decentralization"" when in reality its far less secure because it lacks features like chargebacks and a central authority that can block fraudulent activity and co-operate.

wallets have been hacked, exchanges have been hacked, individual computers and accounts have been hacked, people have been scammed, people have lost hard drives and forgotten passphrases who tried the ""just don't write it down"" method.

Saying bitcoin is secure if you never write your passphrase down and never put it on an internet accessed device is like saying gold is secure if you bury it some place and never tell anyone about it. Great, no one can steal it, its also useless.

&gt;There are some people already living only with bitcoin and without bank account

There are some people who live without any money whatsoever, that is not proof of how feasible it is to live without money.

"I 100% agree. Bitcoin is going to be a failure until two things happen:

1. Banks ALLOW blockchain (not Bitcoin) to succeed, so they still get their fees but now a new security measure (blockchain) makes it less likely to hack. Banks (at least in the USA) have already taken steps to limit exposure to Crypto. It's like Apple Pay. On Paper, Apple Pay sounds great. In reality, like nobody ever uses it. I NEVER see someone use it ever. Just like MySpace, Montgomery Ward, and Circuit City, it WAS the hot new thing, but something BETTER came out. Same with Bitcoin.

2. Walmart just introduced the Walmart Blockchain. I see a time when if you buy a lot of merchandise at Walmart, you can get your paycheck direct deposited in Walmart-Coin, and go shopping, transfer that money worldwide, etc. AND, because Walmart has their own bank, you can also use Walmart-Coin to pay your bills (except your rent).",1522707254

&gt; The wild run on the crypto scene starting from late last year may have created a few sob stories for new investors, as those who bought in during the all-time highs are likely to have incurred losses due to February&amp;#039;s massive correction.

&gt; In that vein here are five reasons as to why the crypto space still continues to encourage more investors to participate.

"Highest trackrecord, coldstorage, limited amount of offerings ( although only for the current moment ) - so scams are unlikely taking place for them as Bitcoin  is probably the safest to hold. They have successfully run their business for a some *years*. 


Binance is catching up, but they're still *new*. That API thing really should not have happened in the first place. That's a fact. They're also self pumping their coin, by annoucing speculative news about decentralized exchanges, which is still just a theory. I use them too, I like them a lot myself! Loved the bounty response. But I still feel safer with Coinbase.


Either way, it's best to hold the majority of your holdings in a Trezor or Nano Ledger.

This is an anonymous social network - where people can talk about their problems absolutely anonymously. We with the team launched the project a year ago in Russia and we already have more than 800 thousand users around the world.

And 3 months ago we decided to hold the ICO of our project, but unfortunately our ICO failed, as we spent all our personal money for this event, and did not even collect 20 Eth. Because there are a lot of ICO scammers in the world and many have now ceased to be trusted. We tried to tell everyone about us, but in a rush of advertising ICO we just did not notice. We are very sad and we are in utter confusion and despair.

We have worked hard on our project and We sincerely desire that people could have such a place where they could reveal themselves. There everyone would be able to find the answer to all questions and, most important, find Themselves again.

I appeal to the world crypto community! We believe in your strength. And we believe in miracles.

Where it does not matter who you are, how you look and what your social status is. Where only your thoughts and your point of view are valued.

"IMO what is most needed now and always is education. But as usual, people will dismiss the importance of such thing.

If everyone understood that Bitcoin is a peer to peer electronic cash system, which makes it the best form of money ever, they wouldn't be buying Segwit/Core. They would understand that developers don't control Bitcoin, and that's exactly what the Aug 2017 fork proved.

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=8315.msg121269#msg121269

Bitcoin was under 10$ then, what makes you think that it has topped out? Do you not think it is possible for it to grow even larger? What makes you so sure it will blow up into non-existance other then the fact you have no skin in the game?",1522706334

There is a larger problem of the distribution of the ETF investment itself though of course. BTC is big enough, and dominant enough, that it would get it's own ETF, but none of the alts I hold would get that same treatment. Maybe eventually there would be a ""platform ETF"", holding ETH, NEO, and ADA (as examples), and a ""supply chain ETF"" with vechain, and WTC, etc etc. But that day is likely pretty far away, if ever.",1522706252

"Also if block size increase centralizes bitcoin, doesn't implementation of LN too? Was the block size scaling solution intentionally let go of to implement LN?

Ive never seen one shred of credible proof that increasing block size is a root cause of centralization, bandwidth and storage are cheap and only getting cheaper, I've run an archival node on an old desktop from home just fine. But the main Bitcoin client is enterprise software, if you can't support it then you don't have much business operating one. All users were not meant to be full nodes, and Satoshi has said as much himself that he expected mining and full nodes to be the domain of datacenters, with light clients for day to day users using SPV.

Yes, BTCs small block size was always meant to be larger than 1mb (it started with 32mb in fact due to other limitations of the protocol, BCH will be restoring that in may. The 1mb limit was a temporary restriction because of an early problem in which miners could cheaply (or freely) bloat the chain). Blockstream and Bitcoin Core developers kept it small to be able to sell their own layer 2 solutions, banking on LN to be their scaling solution over simply restoring BTC to its original design.

One thing to keep note of is that the block size is a *maximum threshold*, the true block size varies block to block depending on other economic forces. A high ceiling just allows moments of congestion to be dealt with swiftly, which BTC is no longer able to do. 

&gt;Also what do you think about the criticism of bch that by increasing block size as a solution for everything, its erring on the side of discouraging people from running their own nodes, which is threatening the security of the whole system?

I think that criticism is only ever said by dumbass propagandists. BCH supporters have no problem with second layer tech and know that just increasing block size isn't an end all be all, we just disagree with limiting on-chain scaling to implement second layer tech which is what Blockstream did while creating artificial hate against on-chain scaling to further their own profit driven agenda. 

As said above, general users were never supposed to be their own node. People in here have a funny idea about what *decentralized* actually means.

"&gt;BTC prices aren't default prices and they aren't stable prices, but it strikes me as odd to argue things aren't priced in BTC when merchants are actively taking it as payment.

Taking something as payment is not the same thing as it being a unit of account.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_account

You can pay for things online using precious metals, its still impossible to calculate prices in metals without a unit of account like fiat because metals do not possess the socially emergent property of currency in any modern economies. The price is set in fiat and then the equivalent value of metal is calculated and transferred. It's not possible to know how many ounces of copper are worth how many ounces of silver without a unit of account. just like its not possible to know how many bitcoins is worth how many lambos without a unit of account. I don't know why anyone would even pretend to know they could calculate their equivalent values otherwise when bitcoins value is constantly referred to in terms of other units of account even in bitcoin communities like /r/bitcoin. its clearly impossible. the only way to kn

&gt;If your hypothetical European shop also took USD as payment, I think it would be fair to say that the ~8 EUR item is ALSO priced at $10, even if not listed as such. The USD price would also likely be based on current exchange rate, much like BTC prices.

Both Euros and USD are currencies and units of account in their respective nations. You can work out the price of something in euros in europe without first working out how much something is in dollars. No one in Europe is asking how many dollars worth of euros something is worth before paying in euros. How many dollars its worth is irrelevant, thats why they have different purchasing power parities.

McDonalds in France don't bump the price of a 99 cent cheeseburger up to €1.01 just because the dollar jumps in value one day. They have separate purchasing power parity because they're separate currencies, people aren't just using euros as a way of trading dollars, they're valued in their own right.

&gt; You're right that the value is unstable, of course, but businesses still price things in BTC and they do actually change the BTC prices constantly

No they don't, they set prices in fiat and then have the computer automatically convert it based on whatever BTC happens to be selling for in that fiat on a particular exchange (or an average of multiple exchanges). No one is sitting there 24/7 constantly setting different prices in bitcoin.

There is no way of working out whether 500 satoshi is a little or a lot to pay for something without a separate unit of account, the same as its impossible to tell whether 0.1 gram of gold is a little or a lot to pay for something without a unit of account.

Its when BCH is sent to a ""3"" address that happens to be a segwit address. In that case, money being lost is a real possibility. The cashaddr spec does not call for ""3"" addresses to be invalid, therefore it's still possible to lose money despite Cashaddr.

As a currency, it is remarkably not useful and severely hampered by the reality that all exchanges are potentially taxable events. 

It's primary function is to be traded.  It's not a stock, it doesn't give you a right of ownership in an asset.  It's not a bond with a right of payment.

I suppose that if a large enough country or organization wanted significant control, they could attempt to buy all BTC available; which points out one of BTC’s fiat vulnerabilities, very low market cap. Certainly, any well-meaning government that decided to institute bitcoin as its official currency would not have access to the money-printing tactics that many use to prop their economies.

"Above all An-caps value individual freedom.  After seeing central authority destroy our monetary system and what America has become today. 

Bitcoin is a tool for individual freedom and it only works if it is controlled by everyone and therefore no one.  If a central set of people have control over it then the entire experiment has failed.  

You understand that if a few big corporations are the ones running bitcoin miners they have complete control over the protocol and can change it at will right?  The incentive structure for corporations running bitcoin will be exactly as they are with the government.  They lobby the government to do whatever the fuck they want.  

I don't want central banking 2.0 and if that's what you think works just fine that's great.  We disagree on a political level as I said originally.  

You have to realize Bitcoin is not a product or a service.  Its a public good.  Having the transactions limited to 1mb keeps it so that Bitcoin can be ran by ANYONE on earth at anytime.  It allows us to run it over satellite and mesh networks.  It's actually fit for being a global currency due to how anti-fragile it is.  You can still have it operate after all the power grid is knocked out by a hurricane.  People from around the world can send their friends and family money still because bitcoin can run over satellite and they can run the node with a solar system.   Way less inputs need to be checked.  Way better use of limited bandwidth. 

Bitcoin is too important for developers to be pushed around by dumb fuck business people cause their feelings.  We saw that with the challenger and people fucking died.  The engineers said no the politicians said yes and they got people killed. 

Core isn't opposed to increasing the blocksize to 2mb in the future, but for right now lets get the most out of what we have while adoption is still small.  This way we don't need to deal with these problems when the entire world is dependent on Bitcoin working.  

Unlimited block space doesn't exist.  We put the cap and instituted the fees for economic purposes.  If it sounds good to you then you're an idiot who doesn't know the history of Bitcoin.

Goods, including money, are abstract: sometimes we need to measure things in economics, and so we categorize things the best we can, into homogenous, fungible units...bit reality (human ends and reasons for desiring things and in what way) is far more complex. A block of ice in winter is not the same good to a person as the exact same block of ice is to them in the summer: in the winter it is a means of sledding down a hill; in summer it is to chill the water in their ice cooler. The value of money cannot be viewed just as the sum of each unit token; the value is in having access to a network of trading partners to alleviate barter inefficiencies, and avail ourselves of the division of labor by agreeing on an arbitrary (but useful) objective measure of how society values various scarce goods and services.  

Money is in fact a mass delusion; a speculative bubble; but a useful one and a stable one in equilibrium.  The ""fundamental value"" is in, not just the utility of the token, but in the monetary system as a whole. It is bad economics to consider a cryptocurrency as having no *intrinsic* value or fundamentals, just because the token has few or no use-cases outside of money. Tangibility of a good or service has never been a prerequisite for value.",1522703954

I'm not sure of the exact number of validator nodes, but I know RippleLabs currently has a majority, but the goal is to have enough validator nodes that they can remove their own nodes completely.

As far as btc pools go. Sure, if one pool misbehaves mining power moves elsewhere, but doesn't that further the problem? Now you have 4 pools with an even bigger say on transactions. What happens if one more does it?

You can technically start your own smaller pool, but if your time to find the next block is substantially higher than a bigger pool, miners will go for the bigger pool.

Contrast this with how the xrp ledger nodes work, where there are many more nodes who have an interest in keeping the xrp network alive. Such institutions as exchanges, banks, financial institutions and schools. Both have pro's and con's, but its sort of difficult to say PoW is better for xrp's usecase and validator nodes are better for btc. They are different validation techniques on purpose.",1522703713

"Breaking that down a little bit:

* Insurance customers place a dollar value on a bad outcome. Because money has diminishing marginal utility, it's rational for everyone to insure against severe loss and/or injury.

* Insurers have an incentive to make these bad outcomes less likely, when possible and cost-effective.

* Insurance policies and insurer actions are limited by public laws. An insurer can't pay someone to shut down a polluter in another country without the permission of that country's government.

* Therefore, [censorship-resistant prediction markets](http://www.truthcoin.info/) can serve consumers in ways that existing insurers can't, because their reach isn't limited by governments.

For example let's say Alice is polluting, and earns 4 BTC for herself by creating 10 BTC worth of costs for everyone else. The victims tried asking their governments to make Alice pay restitution, but the governments refused (for whatever reason). So instead they buy insurance against that pollution, and then the insurer puts out a bounty to eliminate Alice's emissions. Instead of having to pay [whatever price Alice demands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coase_theorem#Damage_from_water_runoff), the victims pay someone cheaper to make her stop.",1522702963

"&gt; rates would go down

Which rates? Ones provided by a central Oracle service outside of the blockchain?

&gt; Gold and other rare raw materials are not used for daily payments but for investment and speculation. 

This should answer your question. BTC is not suited to the task of currency while in it's speculative phase. You end up buying a pizza for $100,000. Instead you're wishing for a ""currency"", something stable. Which isn't BTC, but something else.

&gt; So BTC will not be a currency if it wants to behave like gold. 

Unless it wipes out currencies and becomes so ubiquidous that 1BTC = 1BTC and value not being pinned to some other asset becomes irrelevant.

Otherwise perhaps another *currency* can be pegged to BTC and this will be the daily use *currency*.

None of the Bitcoin forks use this type of distribution curve. They're not trying to duplicate central banks.

&gt; you cannot do any reasonable investment into BTC as it behaves now

Sure you can. Depends on your time-frame. If you're aiming at 15m candles then sure, you'll be churned up.

&gt;Zero-knowledge proofs are Emotiq’s privacy pillar. Like Bitcoin, Emotiq uses
UTXO. Unlike Bitcoin, however, Emotiq uses zero-knowledge proofs to ensure
transaction amounts, among other things, are not visible in the public ledger.
For example, although blockchain addresses are represented by random strings,
it is currently possible for mapping software to crawl Bitcoin’s ledger for spent
and unspent (UTXO) coins, to identify the transactions of a single private key
and determine a holder’s total wealth in Bitcoin.

&gt;While non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs do not prevent such transaction
graph analyses, they prevent the tracing party from seeing the amounts being
transferred. 

AKA sending and receiving addresses are 100% visible?? They don't explicitly say that but the last paragraph indicates that they are not from what I understand.  I am so sick and tired of PR marketing techniques rather than straight up plain English do's  &amp; do not's. Especially in the case of privacy cryptos where such a misunderstanding could destroy any attempt at privacy. 

Another example:

&gt;Emotiq is inspired by Monero and ZeroCash to provide additional privacy solutions, for example, by keeping transaction amounts hidden.

Misleading. Monero does hide transaction amounts. This sentence alludes that it does not and that their implementation brings something new to the table, which is doesn't.

Here's a prime example of putting together words that have no use. ""much easier"" than what?

Were you (doubtful you were alive then, I know I wasn't) when credit cards (debit cards, which by the time these were introduced the hurdles we almost effectively addressed completely) were first introduced.

"&gt; I'm a CPA and armchair reddit know it alls love to ""call me out"" a lot. Doesn't mean they're right, though.

I met an interesting person a few weeks ago. Newly retired, had owned successful businesses, and was certainly a sharp witted guy. A professor of economics at the local University for the past five years before retirement(all by his own admissions). The only question about economics I asked of him came right after he made me aware of that. I've never taken an economics class in my life so it really surprised me when he had no real answer. My question was, ""which school or theory of economics do you subscribe to?"" 

After looking like a deer in headlights for a half second he made an attempt at humor and said something to the effect of ""which ever one puts coins in my pockets."" I tried to pry a bit and suggested I've been attracted to what I've read about Austrian econ and he just looked bewildered. I dropped it and turned the discussion towards technology and bitcoin. 

My point is, just because it's what you do for a living doesn't mean you have exclusive knowledge or any claim of express correctness so why should your opinion on a matter not be questioned? High-status individuals create a stronger likelihood of a subject agreeing with an obviously false conclusion, despite the subject normally being able to clearly see that the answer was incorrect. Redditers simply don't accept appeal to authority arguments because everyone claims authority on everything when they can be anyone they claim to be on any topic. I'm not saying you're being deceitful, just that there's likely to be a mathematician or two-to-three-hundred who are much better at the underlying science of your craft than you are. And that's not to mention the ""gate keepers"" of CPAing in the first place....I don't mean any of that as an insult, I'm sure you're an excellent CPA but failure to be so is hardly a life or death consequence so I don't think too many people outside of your clients and the government care if you're as good as you think you are.

BTC prices aren't default prices and they aren't stable prices, but it strikes me as odd to argue things aren't priced in BTC when merchants are actively taking it as payment.

"A miner invests money (for hardware and electricity) in order to get something (Bitcoin) that they can only sell a while after having made that investment.

During that time the price of Bitcoin may go down (as it just did) and render that investment worthless (that's what you are talking about).

Any miners with a brain will hedge that investment (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_(finance)) by going short on Bitcoin (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_(finance)) which means they spend a little of their money on betting against the Bitcoin exchange rate. There are many ways to that nowadays like futures and other stuff.

This means that if they lose money on the exchange rate they can compensate that loss by winning their bet. If the exchange rate does not go down they have lost their bet but still made money on the price they get for the Bitcoin they mined and the loss they made by shorting Bitcoin can be considered as an expense for an insurance against price decrease.

Any miner who is not short Bitcoin when mining is, well, a bit careless or maybe brainless so I guess the majority of miners is hedged against the current decrease in exchange rate.

And just to clarify when I talk about client I **am** talking about your wallet, cause if you are not mining all you have is a **listening** wallet/client, and you can choose or not choose to **listen to the network** or listen to your own voices all by yourself

"I like your idea, but it appears that the UTXO size is much larger than you state:

BTC, 2.7 GiB (2.9 Gigabytes):

https://statoshi.info/dashboard/db/unspent-transaction-output-set

BCH 2 GiB (2.25 Gigabytes):

http://statocashi.info/d/000000063/unspent-transaction-output-set?orgId=1&amp;from=1518280555647&amp;to=1522698089668

But we could do something where there can be a block for every 32 MB worth or UTXO's changes gets a new block. This would make a kind of UTXO chain.

Even easier would be to implement the pruning described in the whitepaper, and you could know that you have the full UTXO set by totaling the coins held in the UTXO set and comparing that with the amount of coins that should be in existence at the current block height.

&gt;**7.Reclaiming Disk Space**

&gt;Once the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before it can be discarded to save disk space. To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash, transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree, with only the root included in the block's hash. Old blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree. The interior hashes do not need to be stored.


&gt;A block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes. If we suppose blocks are generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year. With computer systems typically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of 1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in memory.

The fact that you need to use centralized systems to either acquire, trade or spend crypto does not take these properties away, more than that they are unavoidable for now at least. What is the problem paying crypto for something through Bitpay? Why would I care it's centralized? Should we wait for decentralized companies before we can spend crypto?

"&gt;&amp;gt; No and I wouldn’t be surprised only a very small percentage of business do it.

&gt;But that is the point: nine years later, very few (if any) legal merchants actually accept bitcoin.  Even the very few who put up the sign ""bitcoin accepted"" actually don't, and only deal with fiat.

Sure, I personally see no problem with that.

Some other peoples around the world are at the same time buying that FIAT back for BTC/BCH. *For every sell there is a buy* and everybody got what they wanted.

&gt;&amp;gt; I see nothing wrong with using bitcoin only as a medium of exchange.

&gt;A ""medium of exchange"" is something that you don't really want, but you accept now in exchange for X, because you are confident that you will **later** be able to exchange it for Y, which you really want.  

&gt;Note the ""later"".  To be a viable medium of exchange, the value of the thing must not change significantly between earning and spending.   For most legal commerce, which works with small profit margins, a loss of 10% of value in one day is WAY too much.

There is no 10% loss during the time a bitpay Payment is processed.. so they are fine.

For those we keep BTC/BCH well they are fine with the risk, I guess.

&gt;And gold has not been a medium of exchange for ordinary commerce for more than a century.  For more than half a century, it has not been a medium of exchange between central banks, either.

I would like a link on that, it goes against things I have read..

&gt;&amp;gt; The same argument can be made for cash.. only criminals need cash am I right?

&gt;At present, not at all.   Even in the most ""digitalized"" countries, the vast majority of cash payments are ordinary legal transactions.

But why those people are not using CB or wiring transfer if they have nothing to hide? It is has to illegal transactions.. why using cash otherwise? (using your argument)

&gt;I still use cash for about half the payments that I make.

Why don’t you use CB if it was a legal payment? Don’t you have nothing to hide?

&gt;&amp;gt; what matters to me is using Bitcoin is more practical than using my bank

&gt;If you require ṕayment in bitcoin, you are restricted to maybe 0.001% of your potential market.  That is why merchants accept credit cards in spite of the 5%  fees:  because if they demanded cash, most of their customers would go elsewhere.

True in some cases.

Could change if people demanded using cryptocurrencies.

"I did address the question. I expect crypto to be much easier to use.

Yes of course you can demonstrate a smooth quick transfer once everything is setup correctly but the fact of the matter is that takes either weeks of research to understand it or blind trust. Blind trust ultimately doesn't work right now because there are too many scams out there.

"I agree that BTC will stay on top for a long while, but it will be replaced eventually. Albeit slowly. Like the writer says, other projects eat up parts of btc's dominance in the market. You can't just call this an incorrect metric and whipe it off the table. This surely is an indication. There are more exchanges offering fiat pairs or alt pairs. And these numbers will keep increasing. Fewer peopleneed btc as their ""gateway crypto"".

Furthermore calling btc totally decentralized and other coins centralized is a false statement. First of all you can't just put all altcoins in the same corner. And second of all the btc miners (e.g. bitmain) have alot of influence and their decisions have a big effect on the market. It's nonsense to call btc decentralized when big players like these are active in the market.

That all being said. I'm thankful for btc, because it was the first of its kind and it made crypto known to the mainstream. Like I said it's here to be the leader for a long time, but disregarding that we can't act like btc is the holy grail.

And 3 months ago we decided to hold the ICO of our project, but unfortunately our ICO failed, as we spent all our personal money for this event, and did not even collect 20 Eth. Because there are a lot of ICO scammers in the world and many have now ceased to be trusted. We tried to tell everyone about us, but in a rush of advertising ICO we just did not notice. We are very sad and we are in utter confusion and despair.

We have worked hard on our project and We sincerely desire that people could have such a place where they could reveal themselves.
There everyone would be able to find the answer to all questions and, most important, find Themselves again.

"I don't think the internals of any coin needs to be regulated, but I think ICO's are dangerous to Bitcoin and Blockchain's reputation. There needs to be currency based blockchains and security based blockchains.

Let's tell it like it is. Most people don't understand investing or finance. When you present people who are in poverty with a way out of poverty, they're going to take it to help their family. ** There are people out there that cannot help themselves ** and they need protecting. Elderly are another example that are prone to scams. I get that some people think ""lesson learned"", but I've lived in poverty and I've seen people go to great lengths to escape. It's not easy and it's usually not until you mid 20's that you realize it's even possible (if you ever do)

Look at Herbalife. It's 100% a pyramid scam and yet it still operates as a legit company because the richest person in the world invested in it to spite an arrogant short seller. I read (haven't verified) that 85% of ICO's don't make it to an exchange. They're just running off with peoples' money. Bitconnect being the first large example of this. In my opinion, things like that need regulated. 

My fear is that Bitcoin will get swept up in that. So I'd much rather wait until Blockchain is out of its infancy until any regulation happens. But when it becomes big enough to matter, regulation is going to come regardless.

"I was just throwing a reference point as an example. But for fun, sure, it wasn't worth a ( lets use USD for now) $ amount agreed on by everyone at the beginning, but as soon as it was invented some form of energy was used to create it. Satoshi had to give up time, which had a value to him to create the coin. So hypothetically, let's say his worth (in time) was like $50/hr. Each hour used to create bitcoin was already worth $50 each hour. Bitcoin began with an invested amount of X$'s from 1 person. You could say, at the time Satoshi knew the price of Bitcoin to be worth a lot more than $50/hr and was ok with giving it away for *free* or selling it for a very, very small price maybe not in $'s but something else. So now it's time to bring it onto the world and get other investors. Who wants bitcoin? To get some bitcoin you have to give up something, be that time to listen and read about his invention, give up a tiny fraction of electricity to mine it, or trade a pizza. Then, the easiest way to acquire bitcoin became exchanging money.

That original invested worth that bitcoin started out with right after Satoshi created was soon to be seen as undervalued by people as time went on, then as more time passed people saw more value as it was limited, which increased the price so much that it's not worth billions, unlike the X$'s that was invested from the start.

So going from the thought of bitcoin, to paper, to actual code, to real world use always had some value. Now does that mean every thought a human has in their head has a value because the thinker gave up time/energy to think about it, which has a very, very small value to them?

"&gt;How many core developers left for bcash

Gavin Andreson has continued working on some tech that BCH may introduce down the road. Otherwise not many that I am aware of, but since anonymity is upheld regardless it is difficult to tell. 

The issue was transparent until /r/bitcoin started censoring all discussion of big-block upgrade proposals starting with the Bitcoin XT client, which was labeled an ""altcoin"" and similar nonsense. This was the start of a massive censorship and gaslighting campaign against anything other than Bitcoin Core, while Blockstream (founded by a few second gen Core devs and banking interests) consolidated the remaining Core developers with commit access to the repo while removing all others (like Gavin), so they effectively cornered development. /r/btc was started so we could again have an open discussion about scaling, which of course has been trolled and brigaded ever since. 

It is actually unknown how much control the Core devs really have over /r/bitcoin as it is operated by totally anonymous accounts, but many of us suspect /u/theymos and others have long been bought and compromised or otherwise handed over to Blockstream's control considering how quickly the tide turned against the original scaling roadmap (lifting the 1mb limit was not supposed to be a big deal).

"Breaking that down a little bit:

* Insurance customers place a dollar value on a bad outcome. Because money has diminishing marginal utility, it's rational for everyone to insure against severe loss and/or injury.

* Insurers have an incentive to make these bad outcomes less likely, when possible and cost-effective.

* Insurance policies and insurer actions are limited by public laws. An insurer can't pay someone to shut down a polluter in another country without the permission of that country's government.

* Therefore, [censorship-resistant prediction markets](http://www.truthcoin.info/) can serve consumers in ways that existing insurers can't, because their reach isn't limited by governments.

For example let's say Alice is polluting, and earns 4 BTC for herself by creating 10 BTC worth of costs for everyone else. The victims tried asking their governments to make Alice pay restitution, but the governments refused (for whatever reason). So instead they buy insurance against that pollution, and then the insurer puts out a bounty to eliminate Alice's emissions. Instead of having to pay [whatever price Alice demands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coase_theorem#Damage_from_water_runoff), the victims pay someone cheaper to make her stop.",1522695142

My starting point is the observation that several different trendlines exist simultaneously. The trendline from 20k is a relevant one, but it's hardly the only available.

Bitcoin's real test under stress in my opinion is found when you remove the hype bubble prices of 20k and measure from the lowest point and bounce after the crash to 6k, which happened at February 6th. If you combine several relevant trendlines you will arrive at a more thorough analysis.

My observation is that the trends since February 6th have been complex, though bitcoin has shown an interesting degree of recovery from the last series of crashes in an unregulated market. While bitcoin still hasn't fully recovered from the recent crash and bounce at 6.4k, we haven't seen a repetition of the worst low of the year yet, albeit the price hang fairly close.",1522694813

"I'm yet to see one post in this thread that is looking at a big enough picture. It's really easy to hate on BTC for being old, slow, expensive, and lacking quick innovation.  That's because you're taking for granted the size of the problems that it's currently solving.  What other project can say they've sustained nearly ten years of uptime with no incident? It's a place where people store their value. Unfortunately it's not that AND a good currency right now but make no mistake, it's coming.  The stars fell into place for BTC to be where it is today. Don't believe all the bs fud and go look at the github, it's being worked on and improved constantly. The whole thing about blockstream completely running the show is a total lie.

You think your coin that's run by a company or has a known creator can ever fend off state sponsored attacks or hold billions of dollars in value without being destroyed in an attack? If you want something that innovates much more quickly than BTC, a centralized team is exactly what you need. A centralized team is also exactly why your coin will never be as strong as BTC. Distributed consensus is difficult to reach but it's happening every day on the BTC network.  Upgrades are slow because it has to be perfect. The value comes from it's very close to flawless history. Most new people coming into the space that have no understanding of this and think BTC sucks because LTC has faster block times and cheaper transactions.  

Last thing I don't see enough people understanding is where the true value in blockchain lies.  Dapps, small distributed companies, and platforms for other people to build on are incredible but they're nothing without true immutability.  99.9999% of everything else happening in the space can be done by central parties in a much faster and more convenient way.  They don't need a blockchain at all but they turn something that sounds like it makes sense into a coin and get rich as hell. I love how this happens in the space.  Everyone else can get paid to innovate while the most secure and only censorship proof coin moves forward slow and steady.  On the biggest picture you can possibly look at, BTC is the first fair money the world has ever seen. This is going to be a long slow process but it's going to win in the end.",1522694714

There are many instances of this happening with russia and other countries that a couple google searches can prove. Like I said, also research the Rothschild's and their meddling in various wars.

"The ups, the downs, the swings, the bubbles, the busts, the speculation. . . is all necessary for price discovery and slow, eventual, decline of the volatility.  There is no other way. There is no shortcut.  Every single decentralized cryptocurrency, is and will be going through this process.  

You're late to the party; we've all done the ""community push to spend instead of just hold"" thing, several times.  It tends to just create a somewhat artificial (if small) uptick in the number of vendors accepting bitcoin (and by ""accepting"" we of course mean, using a payment processor and converting immediately to fiat, rather than paying employees and suppliers and holding any themselves).  This is fine.  There's nothing wrong with it; but it is simply just not a sustainable mechanism for creating the transaction loops which we all wish for in order to make crypto more usable as a currency and help stabilize the price.  Granted, Bitcoin Cash is not going to be as prone to the high transaction fees and slow confirmation times which also caused a lot of merchants to stop accepting the token. . . but again, we've been through phases of adoption which resulted in a lot of attrition, well before scaling became an issue with BTC.

I don't know why so many of you still don't understand what is going on economically, with crypto.  It requires thinking a little beyond first-order causes and effects. . . but it's not that complex:

You cannot program stability into a money protocol, and you cannot simply wish or will adoption and transaction loops into existence.  Public calls for solidarity on ""good discussion"" and avoiding ""speculation"" are next-to-useless.  Why?  Because of the very reason why all cryptos remain volatile (and even bitcoin is only very slowly stabilizing): because there is a giant coordination problem inherent in the creation of money, and it goes something like this:  Why would I adopt a token to use as money, when few others accept it yet as money?  But why would others accept it as money, if few others are buying/holding/spending it as money?  How do you get a worldwide economy of crypto-enthusiasts or holders, to agree upon, not just one price, but in fact a price for *everything* which can bought or sold with the crypto-token? (that is the nature of money; everything else has one price...money has millions of prices; e.g.  One dollar costs a post-card, and it also costs 3 eggs, and it also costs 1/20 of a shirt, etc.)

This is a massive coordination problem or market failure, and it is one reason why, historically, the state has tended to get involved in the creation and production of money, because that overwhelming force they possess and force of law and force of habits (or path dependencies), makes it much easier (less costly up-front), for them to simply declare a certain commodity ""the money"" and even set a value or exchange rate, which everyone immediately follows.

If you are interested in buying and selling things with cryptocurrency; you are necessarily in this for the prospect of the formation of a new money or monetary unit; whether you realize it or not.  This has so little to do with payment networks alone, or sticking it to banks.  Bitcoin's very makeup and protocol, make it very suited for very few things other than money (i.e. it has excellent monetary properties, or latent network externalities as a medium of indirect exchange, store of value, and unit of account; such as fungibility, divisibility, transportability, scarcity, etc.).  The token (being digital or virtual) had to have it's own, built-in, rudimentary payment network (we meatbags can't physically grab a bitcoin and give it to someone else).  But this payment network aspect (as important as it is in order to help overcome the coordination problems), is auxiliary to bitcoin's nature as future money or proto-money.  It would be nearly pointless to try to simply create another payment network to compete with the centralized services. . . and use PoW blockchains to do it.  That would be madness.  That's not what Satoshi and Hal Finney and the other cypherpunks were trying to do. . .that's not what any sane person is trying to do.  We are trying to create stateless money.

So, this coordination problem acts a little bit like a classic public goods problem; in that, it is group rational to have a common money/monetary system with the latent properties which bitcoin possesses; but yet it is individually rational to reject the token as worthless, or doomed to fail. . . or to simply free-ride off of the others who do spend money to acquire and adopt and mine and spend the token; both in terms of speculating on the price, and in terms of letting others build the transaction loops and the infrastructure and services necessary to make it a universal, worldwide currency or money.

So, unless you want a government or government(s) to take over this project and declare an exchange price for bitcoin, and create an immediate demand sink for it, such as requiring that taxes be paid in this token. . . then you need to understand what mechanisms markets posses for coordinating against these types of market failures and producing public goods.  You need to understand that (to quote economist Markus Brunnermeier) ""Money is by definition a bubble since it derives its value from resale option.""  In other words, money is a speculative asset, by it's very nature.  It is a permanent bubble.  It is a mass delusion of recursive value, born of the fact that having a common medium for indirect exchange (avoid the transactions costs of barter), is highly valuable and beneficial to the group or economy as a whole.  

So, there is no stopping the speculation, without stopping it from being or becoming money.  But more importantly, the speculation is an important part of overcoming the coordination problems of market production of money, and eventually stabilizing the exchange value (which stabilization can only be a direct product of higher market cap/liquidity, and positive expectational feedback loops from use as a unit of account).  See, lottery and games of chance have been used for centuries by charities and communities and even governments, in order to produce public goods.  The lottery of the speculative game which is investing in cryptos, is what drives people to build up the ecosystem and buy and hold and accept and try to pay suppliers and employees and create transaction loops. . .despite the free-riding which is occurring and will always occur.  

I don't know why the speculative aspect it is so distasteful to so many, especially the new people in our community; but it does serve an irreplaceable purpose.  And while I'm all for warning and cautioning people (don't invest more than you can afford to lose, in fact don't day trade, dollar-cost-average, don't just hold, but spend also, etc.), we also need to celebrate the bubbles and busts as much as we fear them; they are what has historically (despite the attrition during the busts) created the most adoption, and coordinated the most transaction loops, historically.  

Let whales and institutional investors and a few crazy people day trade and kill themselves or make killings.  I am absolutely **not** talking about going all ""Biiitconeeeeeect!!!"" on people.  But stop misunderstanding the repeated patterns of bubble and bust as a necessarily unhealthy thing, but rather, let people know that, in responsible amounts and ways, they are not necessarily making a bad decision by investing (if they are willing to hold for the long-term) even when the price is clearly running up in to bubble territory.  And don't dissuade people from being excited about the process of making some amazing returns either.",1522694469
"&gt; No and I wouldn’t be surprised only a very small percentage of business do it.

But that is the point: nine years later, very few (if any) legal merchants actually accept bitcoin.  Even the very few who put up the sign ""bitcoin accepted"" actually don't, and only deal with fiat.

&gt; I see nothing wrong with using bitcoin only as a medium of exchange.

A ""medium of exchange"" is something that you don't really want, but you accept now in exchange for X, because you are confident that you will **later** be able to exchange it for Y, which you really want.  

Note the ""later"".  To be a viable medium of exchange, the value of the thing must not change significantly between earning and spending.   For most legal commerce, which works with small profit margins, a loss of 10% of value in one day is WAY too much.

And gold has not been a medium of exchange for ordinary commerce for more than a century.  For more than half a century, it has not been a medium of exchange between central banks, either.

&gt; The same argument can be made for cash.. only criminals need cash am I right?

At present, not at all.   Even in the most ""digitalized"" countries, the vast majority of cash payments are ordinary legal transactions.  I still use cash for about half the payments that I make.

&gt; what matters to me is using Bitcoin is more practical than using my bank

"Uh... that's kind of a misleading question.

0conf isn't a solution, it's a situation. Any transaction that isn't in a block is 0conf. Typical Bitcoin services require confirmations - in layman's terms, waiting - before considering the payment ""secure"". This is largely due to the potential for successful fraud; services used to operate with simple risk-assessment protocols that successfully protected them from fraud well enough to be manageable before 2014.

The only risk involved with considering an unconfirmed transaction ""secure"" is the risk of that transaction not eventually being confirmed; so if all the ways that condition could happen are considered, a simple risk matrix can be built and a transaction's ""security"" can be quantified as a function of the transaction's complexity, age, fee, propagation to other participants, etc. in a manner that is automatable. In short, a system can be programmed to determine how likely it is that an unconfirmed transaction will confirm in a timely manner, and *immediately* release goods or services based on that measurement of risk. **This is everyday business behavior: risk management.** Every card-reader on Earth performs this function for merchants today.

When you apply a simple risk assessment matrix to BTC, the results are rather astonishing: for any transaction, of any age, the measurable reliability is too low to justify risk. This is because the odds of confirmation failure radically increase as the coin ages and fee congestion occurs. Since congestion is unpredictable, this risk always exists, and cannot be effectively managed. Thus, confirmations are now required.

The condition of unconfirmed transactions not being reliable is a somewhat recent development, made possible by the combined stalwart opposition to direct capacity increase and introduction of hacky ""solutions"" such as Opt-In RBF and automatic mempool purging. SegWit layers another risk factor in the ability to slip invalid signatures past non-compliant nodes.

BCH, however, is unencumbered by several of the factors that yield such poor results. A basic assessment of nearly any unconfirmed BCH transaction gives 99.9% confirmation reliability in under five seconds. This is what people typically mean by ""0conf"", but that name is not just terrible, it's highly misleading. So call it Zero-Wait. After all, that's what you really mean: the ability to accept an unconfirmed transaction based on an *instant and automatic* risk assessment. BCH creates an environment where that risk is low enough to conduct business.",1522692811

Second, every single investment prospectus has language warning ""past performance is no guarantee of future results"" and yet you are trying to argue that ""past performance is a guarantee of future results.""

During the housing bubble right up to the point where it was beginning to implode the pundits kept saying ""housing prices have never declined on a nationwide basis"" as their argument that housing prices could not possibly go down.

Maybe some of those made a little money and are waiting for the next apparent bull market. But consider realms outside investing, what if they're also interested in implications of blockchain industry, want to be involved in ICO's, or are entrepreneurs who see potential in the market? Perhaps they're interested in the tech or intrigued by the implications of open, borderless, payment system unbound by governments or banks. Maybe they see it as an opportunity to pursue a new career as a developer or content producer. There are many, many ways to be active in crypto which have nothing to do with the current price.

"&gt;&amp;gt; AFAIK they also have the option to keep the BCH/BTC.   ...business that have cost in BTC/BCH will take the cryptocurrency.

&gt;Do you know of any who do that?  

No and I wouldn’t be surprised only a very small percentage of business do it.

But for those who need the option is there.

&gt;With bitcoin's volatility, accepting crypto payments would be suicide.  Legal merchants work with narrow profit margins, 10% or less.  The merchant's revenue from sales may lose half its value when it is time to pay the staff and utilities bills.  Not to mention the $25 or more transaction fee *on each sale or bill payment*...

I see nothing wrong with using bitcoin only as a medium of exchange.

To me it is « medium of exchange » that is disruptive not yet another speculative asset (digital gold)..

So I guess we agree here.

&gt;Face it: as a payment system, bitcoin is shit. (Sorry for the language, but that is the most accurate technical term.)

Personally I don’t think so as bitcoin save me few for big trouble when traveling, but we already discussed about that.

It has proven being more reliable than traditional banking (excluding BTC fee event last year.. but now I not ising BTC at all anymore.. feel too Ponzi for me)

&gt;Criminals use bitcoin because they have no other choice, and are used to pay huge fees and deep discounts to money laundering middlemen.  

I use bitcoin 100% legally (and declare **all** My transactions to the taxman) and a few time Because I had to use it because I had no other choice (legal transactions still) with traditional banking options I was screwed.

Permissionless is important when you travel not only for criminals :)

So I guess there is at least one person using it legally :))

(The same argument can be made for cash.. only criminals need cash am I right?)

&gt;If the price of a drug on a DNM is already 100 times its production cost, it does not matter if the payment system puts a 100% penalty plus a $100 fee for several rounds of mixing...

I agree.

&gt;&amp;gt; [Credit cards] with sometime huge fees and poor exchange rate.

&gt;That's not the point.  The point is that a merchant who ""accepts bitcoin"" through BitPay does NOT actually accept bitcoin.   There are VERY few legal merchants that actually ""accept bitcoin"".  Not sure Overstock still accepts it...

Fine, what matters **to me** is using Bitcoin is more practical than using my bank.

If the merchants directly sell it back because it used it only as a medium of exchange that’s 100% ok with me.

The fact that bitcoin allows everyone to convert to Fiat « closer to home » is already an incredible achievement.

It suggests that bitcoin can be a solution to remittances.

That has the potential to improve live of millions around the world.

&gt;(But, by the way, BitPay charges fees too.  When the BTC transaction fees were $25 or more,BitPay charged that from the consumer, too.)

Sure but the simple fact that I know all cost at the time of the payment make it a superior option for me.

Though I agree for someone that don’t travel and leave in a stable economy, bitcoin is likely not very useful (unless one use yours.org a lot).
",1522692586
"&gt; Well it looks like you made up your mind.

Based on facts.

&gt; Just know that BTC the way it was before segwit and LN was much easier to protect against dishonest mining

I've heard this argument before and I don't see anything different. Reorganizing the layout of blocks can't lead to vulnerabilities: it's same data, just moved around. In other words, if this attack is possible after SegWit, it was certainly possible before SegWit.

&gt; The lightning network, was just ddosed bringing down 20% of the nodes

This was debunked already. When LN nodes are upgraded these days, they require closing all channels, which means appearing to be down. And even if it's true, nobody ever claimed LN is done. It's beta. I'd love to see you code some software and being it perfect at the first attempt.

&gt; You will also have to hire 3rd party watchtowers to watch your transactions.

No, I don't, since I run my own full node.

&gt; The LN will also have more centralization with channel factories.

Decentralization isn't some ultimate goal. Trustlessness is the goal. I don't care if something is centralized if that center is physically incapable of screwing me. In LN, no node is capable of screwing someone else and that's enough. That being said, [I don't see any center here](https://lnmainnet.gaben.win/).

It's too complex and doesn't solve anything. You can argue Segwit with it's 4x (effective) block size increase, but lightning doesn't help scaling if you have to invest in watchtowers and nodes. That's centralization.

Had I known it would be this simple to increase the block size back then, I would have been all for it. But I believed in the narrative that it would be too dangerous and would centralize Bitcoin. It's almost been 8 months and BCH feels more like the old BTC. People are motivated to help and are using it. I don't want a store of value. I could buy gold if I wanted that. 

The problem is that most investors don't know the difference and the narrative is being strongly pressed against BCH. Everyone goes to YouTube or Twitter and listen to the same people for their investment advice. That's how Bitconnect happens. Hell, I'm catching up and just saw the Litepay fiasco. Everyone hyped up Litepay, including Charlie lee. They invested $50K which adds to it's legitimacy. Then when they find out it's a scam, they apologize for not doing their due diligence. That's not okay. What kind of person does not do any due diligence before investing $50K knowing sure well all their followers listen to what they say. Then they shrug it off and say ""We didn't tell you to invest"". That sets Bitcoin and Blockchain back 3 years. Makes it look exactly like a pyramid scheme, and currently, they're not wrong.

"&gt; Well you can buy it from another person but then you are gonna say fiat itself is centralized

That's true isn't it? 

If the only way bitcoin works is as an intermediate for fiat then it can't be a replacement for fiat, its just an adjunct to fiat, which no one disputes it has (limited) uses for, mainly avoiding laws on online payments that traditional payment processors have to obey.

This is only a use case in black and gray markets where online fiat can't legally compete. As soon as you have competition from fiat people switch back to centralized payment processors like Shift or Bitpay. bitcoin simply can't compete with centralization on a level playing field.

If the only way euros worked was if you could somehow trade euros for dollars no one would be saying euros offer financial independent from dollars.

&gt;But why is that an issue? Is the goal to not touch anything centralized ever or you are not hardcore enough? 

It's an issue if you're claiming decentralization is fulfilling some sort of use case yet people using bitcoin are turning to centralized solutions at every turn.

It undermines the core value proposition that decentralization is either useful or desirable if the very people who are supposed to be spearheading a new decentralized currency are primarily using it through centralized payment processors.

Makes you think it might be about something other than getting rid of centralization and middlemen, and is actually just about profiting off speculation on a bunch of finite numbers on a database.",1522691812

"People should learn about forks but also how they are different when it comes to Blockchain. Soft-fork is really a fancy term for software updates which happens all the time, so it is silly to keep using this term as if it is comparable to a hard-fork. 


A hard-fork is a permanent split in both code and developer base. Before a hard-fork happens with ""the real"" Bitcoin there is an original shared history, that is the shared history up until August 1st complete with all the prior software updates until that date. 


After a hard-fork happens (which it did because there was a disagreement) both new projects both previously called Bitcoin are now not compatible with each other, forever. There is no ""I forked and you didn't""... if a hard-fork happens there becomes two new separate chains each with their own trajectories, yet both of them share the same Bitcoin history. They were both Bitcoin for all the years prior until August 1st, 2017.


The thing about both soft-forks and hard-forks is that they can lead to more proprietary systems (Like macOS derived from proprietary NeXTSTEP + open-source FreeBSD), and that's kind of what the latest **core** soft-fork does, by moving to SegWit and preparing for proprietary off-chain ""scaling"" (lightning/liquid) money-grabs, at this point the software is so different that in order to remain honest a name-change (probably to Lightning at this point) will be required.

The alts drag bitcoin down.  I am not a bitcoin maximalist.  40% of my portfolio is in non-BTC/ETH crypto.  That said...

Altcoins are WAY overvalued with the possibility of ETC, LTC and a few others).  No project that exists with a $30/mo web page and a 10 page pdf should have a valuation of 6 figures USD, let alone 8.

Bitcoin's limited supply is designed to make something scarce in a world of digital copies, but with all the alt-coins, that scarcity is kinda ""meh"".

Altcoins are pure speculation.  People who think that BTC is too mature and dont want in at the ground level, but are going for the basement choose altcoins.  This drives DOWN the price of bitcoin.  

I dont think the de-coupling will have the effect you are desiring.  Pairing against BTC gives them SOME sort of legitimacy by comparing them to bitcoin.  Those pairings make HODLING the alt-coins easier during volatility because it can be a giant PITA to convert back to BTC or ETH while liquidating.  The main thing it WILL help with is price discovery.  Fiat pairs let you know exactly what you are paying, while adding the variable of the BTC or ETH volatility to the alt price makes things very difficult to compare. This or that alt is worth xxxx satoshis, but how much is a satoshi worth today?  Hard to say.",1522691073

"&gt;Likewise, you compare the price of the pizza in BTC to what else you might get for that amount and you decide there are things you'd rather have for 5,000 BTC than a pizza.

except you can't do that because no one is pricing anything in BTC. It's not feasible for a business to constantly be increasing and decreasing prices on a daily basis, which is what they would have to avoid selling things at a loss every time bitcoins value changed.

customers would also hate it because they'd have to constantly look up what the value of bitcoin was before buying anything to make sure they weren't getting ripped off. You would have to be an idiot to buy anything in BTC without first looking up the value of BTC

The only way you can compare prices of things in bitcoin is by comparing it to the value of fiat.

Do you think people in the eurozone price everything in dollars and constantly ask for different amounts of euros so they can meet the same value of dollars? No one says ""that'll be $10 worth of euros"", they price directly in euros.

If they were doing that, you might ask why they don't just use dollars if all they care about euros for is how many dollars they can get for them.",1522691025

Yes, the precious metals rigging is well-documented.   But do you think that the same cartel - which is backed by an infinite supply of easily-printed fiat - does not have the means to manipulate a crypto market that is a fraction of the size of the PM market?

After 50 years on this planet, here’s what I know: the people at the top of the food chain have gotten as far as they have by doing things that can’t be easily “documented”.  They don’t advertise their actions or mechanisms.  This is where common sense comes in.  PM rigging wasn’t “documented” for years, but anyone with a working brain who watched the price action could put two and two together.  The same thing is now happening with cryptos.

This is how control has been exerted for eons upon the unsuspecting masses, and we consistently rely on the “Meh, it’s all speculation” or “It’s causation without proof” shtick, which is precisely how we have been conditioned to think by those in control.

Hell, if the Founding Fathers required as much “documented” proof of shenanigans as we require today, Americans would still be serving at the pleasure of the British Crown.

You don’t want only ASIC and PoW but diversity on the entire network. Different mining pools each with a fractioned portion of all the mining power to the point where it would take 3 pools to come together to launch a 51% attack. That is the only way to have insurance against them. If you’re looking at a crypto that is PoW and it doesn’t have diversity in it mining power it is insecure and a good candidate for attack. PoS only protects against singular entry point of attack. It does not prevent collusion amongst large stake holders where they come together with more than 51% combined.,1522690206

"/u/MemoryDealers - I fully support this.   One thing Bitcoin ""technical engineers"" never cared about was marketing.   And it was one of Bitcoins biggest weaknesses.

"&gt; Miners do indeed need funding to operate, if they have no/few users they will run negative until they have no money and the bank turns off the power, end of POW.

This is a war of attrition situation in which the party with the most resources to burn is the miners. The miners *will* win that fight. Transactions will dry up before miners do; after all, for a miner to quit mining and realize gains, they must first transact, and that transaction is not reliable without block production. In this situation, miners only go broke after other users. This argument also ignores the existence of the block subsidy, which is capable of sustaining operations without transactions in the blocks for quite some time.

&gt; If the users decide it is not worthless they will outbid each other until blocks are profitable enough 

Not without PoW to claim those fees. No miners = no blocks. No blocks = no confirmations. No confirmations = no transaction reliability. No transaction reliability = no use case. No use case = no value. A transaction won't ever confirm without work, no matter how high the fee.

"**Cognitive dissonance**

In the field of psychology, cognitive dissonance is the mental discomfort (psychological stress) experienced by a person who simultaneously holds two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values. The occurrence of cognitive dissonance is a consequence of a person performing an action that contradicts personal beliefs, ideals, and values; and also occurs when confronted with new information that contradicts said beliefs, ideals, and values.

In A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance (1957), Leon Festinger proposed that human beings strive for internal psychological consistency in order to mentally function in the real world. A person who experiences internal inconsistency tends to become psychologically uncomfortable, and is motivated to reduce the cognitive dissonance.

"Coins that you magically received out of thin air due to a fork typically need to be declared as income. Once you have access to them, you now have an accession to wealth. To calculate this income, simply take the number of coins you now have access to, and multiply it by that day's fair market price. It's well known that when the Bitcoin fork happened this past summer on August 1st, the fair market price was $266/$277. (depending where you check)

Now, it's unreasonable for someone to keep track of and report taxes on every single forked coin they may or may not have access to. Especially if they don't agree with the fork - and never use/touch those forked coins. In the event that you don't file income taxes on them, that is OK. However, if you ever go to spend them one year later, you must declare your cost basis as zero. This means capital gains tax is applied against 100% of the value.",1522689279

Even places accepting payment in bitcoin price things in fiat (i.e. $500 worth of bitcoin) because bitcoin is far too volatile for pricing and people are generally using it as an intermediate for fiat. Merchants would have to constantly be watching the market to adjust their prices if they tried to price things in Bitcoin. They would risk bankrupting themselves if the value of bitcoin halved and they didn't double their prices to compensate.

"&gt;BCH blazed a trail and started its own proof of work. BTC, however, fell in line with miners: nonmining nodes that disagreed with SegWit's changes to the rules either changed their acceptance rules or dropped off the BTC network entirely.

I think you have that opposite, BCH was announced by a miner that also funds the reference implementation (Bitmain/ABC) and BTC went against miners (over 90% miner support for a 2x hardfork that didnt occur)

Also full nodes that didnt change to segwit acceptance rules did not drop off the network, they still function today albeit with hacky segwit compatibility

Miners need users more than users need miners, a fork with miners without users = no POW due to no funding, a fork featuring users without miners = no POW *until the increasing block value attracts new miners*",1522688332

"There is obviously a connection between number of users and the price, but what they don't get is the real value basics:

It is a market, the supply is people who have bitcoin but want to sell for a certain price, the demand is people who want to have more at a certain price. Selling is the same as wanting to have less, so the sellers and the buyers can be combined into one concept, the demand to have an amount of coins at a certain price. The *reason* for wanting to hold is always about what they belive is going to happen in the *future*.

When the network increases, it means of course that more people want to hold coins, meaning higher demand. Demand is a list of pairs, so many for this price, so many for this other price ...

But think of this: When the network expands quickly, many people are newcomers and they want to hold just a little sum to get a feel for it. Buying a small amount and involve the emotions are both rational.

When the newcomers learn more by digging into it and experiencing it, and also activating *care*, they will want to hold more. So the network expansion comes first, then the demand, which also depends on *how much* you want to hold at a certain price, increases. 

So if you want to correlate price with number of users, expect a delayed price reaction.",1522687738

No question about that. My observation isn't only about installation though, it's about running these on your home device 24/7. Asking content creators themselves to run all those apps all the time just seems unlikely to happen.

We have some experience with this on OpenBazaar. Our first network was always on and required people to constantly be online. It pushed people towards using VPS, and users didn't like the experience. Our new network uses IPFS to avoid the need to always be online and it's a much better UX.

BTC has been around for less than 10 years and there is still development going on with it. IDK how people can keep spouting the BS that it has failed as a currency already. It seems like something that you say when you're stuck in the past/present. It is way too premature to say that BTC has failed.,1522685550
"Bitcoin is about freedom though, how can you misuse bitcoin?  

What if someone says you misuse bitcoin?  Is it not just a matter of perspective?  ",1522685530
"It's not so simple to just fork Bitcoin to create a new blockchain. The network only becomes secure when enough people are running nodes, with incentive to verify transactions honestly. One reason that BTC has potential, is the size of the node network. You can fork it, but if thousands of people don't do it with you, it means nothing.

I agree that the volatility of BTC restricts its use as a currency. However, as a store of value it can be sent to other countries faster and with smaller fees than traditional banking. 

Several hundred million people live in foreign countries and send money home regularly. They pay huge fees to do this with traditional banking. Bitcoin ATMs are being rolled out around the world. So for an immigrant working in Europe or the USA, it makes sense to convert fiat to BTC to send it back home, where the receiver can convert it to their fiat. Using BTC this way makes sense whether it's worth 7k or 170k. Volatility is still an issue, but even with volatility, it makes more sense to send BTC than to pay all the fees of sending money via Western Union. 

All that said, I think there is a good chance another blockchain will replace BTC. ",1522685520

"Bitcoin is the link between Crypto enthusiasts, retail investors+the media, and institutional investors. For other coins to decouple, some coin has to prove itself to either 

A: establish itself as a marketable and dopted retail trading coin or investor coin 
B: establish itself as a marketable and adopted alternative to current payment methods. 


I doubt B will happen in the next 5 years. There was a window for it and its closed. A seemed likely, bitcoin and some other coins would be become sanctuaries where people would hide their money in uncertain times or fear in the market. With the hacks, instability, scams and lack of regulation that never happened. 

Right now the stock market is tanking because of the fear of trade wars, this should be the time that BTC sees an upward chart. That hasn't happened, the opposite has happened, they broke through key support levels. below the 50 and 200 day moving average.

"This is the biggest point of pain I have myself with some of Bitcoin's hate. 

I think the electricity used is worth the financial sovereignty Bitcoin provides. It is probably far less than what banks and credit processors and paper producers and branches and server farms and security firms and fuel and on and on and on that the normal system uses day to day. 

Then you can look at the human consumption problem and I never see any hate about eating meat, flying in airplanes, purchasing shit trinkets from overseas, new phones and PC's and TV's every year, etc. Everything about our advanced societies demands power and resources and it will never reduce though we can use more efficient and sustainable practices over time. Bitcoin is also probably going to help drive the adoption to solar, and hydro, and geothermal alternatives quicker than anything we have now, yet people get so hung up on the power consumption for mining because it sounds like a big number. They forget to look at their own lives and see how everyone can contribute in a positive way by reducing meat consumption, purchasing local food, biking more, smarter consumption, etc., but it's always someone else that's doing the damage and easy to lay the blame.

"Don't know. I think I will only ever care about using Bitcoin when it's easier or more beneficial to use over fiat/cards.

The only situation right now where I'd use Bitcoin is if I needed to make an international transfer to another person, but that person would already need to have their own wallet set up (so chances of this happening are close to 0%), or purchasing something online.



What's worse is that I have an investment in Bitcoin, so if I were to use Bitcoin I'd look to add back to my initial investment, which at the moment requires me to make a bank transfer to an exchange (I don't have any local Bitcoin ATMs around me), and this takes time.

"Look at this excerpt from CSW's paper.  The kernel of this issue was embodied in Peter R's bet.  It also appears in the comments ""Marlow"" made regarding my medium paper.

The bottom line is that u/Peter_R was correct and CSR wrong with the bet.

CSR's paper is horribly written and overly complicated in other ways. In particular, the following section is completely irrelevant to the discussion:

&gt;The block distribution system in Bitcoin is based on a semi-complete ring network, whereas the assumptions in the selfish mining model are derived from the behavior of the mesh network extended to Sybils. The Bitcoin mining network is a near complete ring. As a result, the model used here (Eyal &amp; Sirer, 2013) is incorrect. 

Network topology has nothing to do with the mathematical analysis of the basic problem, which applies when there are only two mining nodes.  In this case there is only one possible topology, namely a complete graph on two nodes.  Furthermore, any analysis that takes into account propagation delays adds needless complication, as it should be clear that the effect on results of typical orphan rates would not be different than a slight shift in mining power between the two (groups of) miners.

The first quarter of 2018 had been pretty grievous with the bitcoin prices falling below $6,000 at one point and the overall crypto market size dropping by about 57 percent. However, today the market did experience some green with bitcoin currently being at $7,083, ethereum at $390 and Litecoin at $119, let’s take a look at upcoming crypto events 2018 that triggers crypto market again.

As we reported earlier, many analysts are considering it the death of bitcoin while people like Bill Barhydt, theCEO of Abra believes a bullish trend is coming soon that will be the result of institutional investors’ entry into the crypto market.

A bullish trend is certainly in order but there are certain events that would trigger the positive sentiments in thecrypto market leading to the upward trend.

Consensus: A highly anticipated Coindesk crypto event

To be held on May 14, this 3-day Consensus 2018 cryptoevents involves big names from cryptocurrency industry and also includes regulatory authorities that will discuss blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Last year this event triggered the bullish trend of June.

It has been believed that this highly anticipated event will do a repeat of history and bring the wave of roaring green in the market.

SEC’s approval on crypto-based ETFs

One such event that requires our special attention is if SEC (Securities Exchange Commission) allows the trading of crypto ETFs. An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is basically an investment fund which is traded on stock exchanges just like stocks which are very attractive as investments because of their stock like features, low costs, and tax efficiency. Most ETFs track an index and operates with an arbitrage mechanism.

In January, SEC asked several crypto-based ETFsto withdraw their proposals citing how the funds holding massive crypto amounts can’t satisfy the 1940 Act which is basically investment advisors act that requires the security investment advisors to be registered with the SEC.

At the end of last month, Cboe (Chicago Board Options Exchange) that launched bitcoin futures made an appeal to the SEC to allow ETFs for cryptocurrencies.

Crypto ETF covers various difficult financial products which means it allows the investors to purchase groups of cryptocurrencies instead of having them make individual investments in different currencies. This means investors would be less exposed to the wide volatility in the crypto market.

Through ETFs, an investor can pursue additional currencies while holding the stake in the popular bitcoin at the same time. If SEC does approve crypto ETFs albeit of course by putting substantive measures on them, it will help building investors trust in them as well.

Putting a hard cap on Ethereum (ETH)

Recently, ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin proposed in a post on Github to cap the ethereum supply at 120 million eth. No doubt, by limiting the supply of eth cryptocurrency, a potential price rise is in its future.

SEC has been always been pretty rough when it comes to ICO. With the increase in the scams and frauds in the ICO projects, this surely doesn’t come as a surprise. Regulatory authorities want to curb down the illicit and deceitful use of this crowdfunding method by bringing them under their regulatory provisions. This would only help the crypto community as it not only aids in eliminating the bad factors but will also bring the institutional investors into the market once they know where exactly the market stands with the authorities.

SEC has been issuing notices to the individual ICO projects, but ethereum being the most used and popular backing technology for ICOs, it won’t be long when it would be directly approached by the authorities.

By capping the ethereum supply, the entry into the ICO market can be made tough and restrictive that would also lead to increase in the prices of GAS that would further eliminate the opportunists looking for making quick bucks through ICO market.

All these crypto events currently hold a major significance in the cryptocurrency sector that will lead to an upward trend.",1522684415

If you can clarify to me something. I'm imagining some old Chinese  (80+ years) people on the parliament making these decisions. Like do they understand the technology behind this?

"&gt; Edit:addendum when nodes reject blocks they just ignore them. If you are not running specially designed software you wouldn't notice or even record it happened. If multiple blocks that break rules come in to a node and they are all getting rejected old nodes would disconnect you completely from the network and not even record future rejected blocks.

Bingo! There are no warnings. So why would you think that various block explorers will warn you? The most likely scenario is that nobody would notice.

&gt; The majority used ran nodes do nothing but run in the background and waste electricity. If you do not monitor those nodes, set up alarms, and verify the data with 3rd party software keep the node up to date etc you are doing nothing.

I've never advocated running them in the background. I use my full node to verify whether I received valid bitcoins. I don't know what majority does (nobody knows).

&gt; You don't need 12k nodes running to verify 20 mining pools aren't cheating.

If you want to trust others to validate transactions for you, fine, it's your choice to be less secure. Just stop advising other people making same choices. I'm fine with neutrally explaining why you decided as you decided.

Finally, there's another thing to think about: Bitcoin is anti-government technology and for it to make sense, it must withstand *all* government attacks - including the attempt of government to DoS it. (It's not rational for private miners to destroy bitcoin, but it is rational for government assuming bitcoin is a threat to them.) If people stop running full nodes, then there's a simple way government can DoS bitcoin: they create invalid blocks to cause confusion, so all SPV users can't use it safely anymore (or must wait ridiculous amount of confirmations). However, if one runs a full node, he can safely use Bitcoin even in such doomsday scenarios.",1522683775

Ven is because i believe there is a need for blockchain in supplychain. Tracking pagages, products inhouse, tracking cars lifecycles and more. The reason i picked VEN instead of Walton or Wabi is that Vechain has a LOT more partnerships and time and again proces they want to reward early adopters.

"Money being fiat represents a high point in achievement. Money is just a contract anyway. It doesn't need a physical token form to inspire confidence. When there are laws to enforce contracts money is stable. When there aren't money isn't. The best way to stabilize money is to build a society that functions by the rule of law.

Because money must be originated from nothing there will always be an obligation counterpart to every asset. If you think credit is a problem that is not so. A country is only as affluent as the amount of money it can float in its economy. All the dollars in the private sector have their counterpart in a debt obligation.  To get rid of credit and to settle obligation is to remove money from the private sector. This is what trips up libertarians who think money can be held without obligation. Bitcoin does not circumvent any of this since it is just commodity traded in money. To have wealth in a society means the public sector can manage the obligation side while the private sector enjoys all the buying power of money. ",1522682287

"My opinion on how we got here is on October 31st CME announces futures trading.  Institutional money knows they can exploit this feature on a major platform.  So they started buying up bitcoins until the FUD starts for segwit2x in middle November.  Segwit2x was an attempted takeover of the development team by major businesses in bitcoin such as the DGC bitpay and coinbase.

After that fud passed the institutional money continued to buy.  This happened until a little after futures started going live on December 11th.  Later that week we hit the all time high and in my opinion this is when big money shorted bitcoin on CME and sold what they bought on the run up to 19k+.  This was a big move to make money and manipulate the market with the help of mainstream media and fomo.

After a few months of shorts this is where we are.  We are near equilibrium with a lot more users, LN is live, and there's all kinds of great stuff going on in bitcoin.

He goes on to point out the current limitations of cryptocurrencies, and to some extent he's right. These are known issues, and the community is working on them.

However, dismissing the entire reason for the existence of cryptocurrencies at the top of the first slide, screams: ""I either don't understand the problem cryptocurrencies are trying to solve or, more likely, I have an anti-crypto agenda."" 

Government interference in monetary systems is a MAJOR problem. Many of us believe that the limitations of cryptocurrencies are acceptable given that the alternative is to tolerate the damage caused by current governmental monetary policy.

Miners don't get to set the consensus rules; they get to enforce them. If they don't enforce the consensus rules, they aren't mining Bitcoin.

"&gt; It is known that whatever one could do with a smart contract with an account based system, like Ethereum, one could do with a UTXO based model.

I guess the UTXO model isn't the main limitation here. A bitcoin script simply unlocks a UTXO, while in ethereum it can e.g. create a transaction and change the output amounts.

&gt; make a pay-to-anyone UTXO of 1 BCH, with a few conditions, namely pay to me if you lose, else pay to you (if you win).

How could a UTXO script restrict the output of a new transaction that spends it?

&gt; Also, that UTXO could only be accessed, if that you make a transaction grouping it with an additional UTXO, as follows: if last BTC blockhash was (even/odd) send to self, else send to me.

How would you ensure that ""that UTXO could only be accessed""? On a side note, Bitcoin script is intentionally blockchain-blind: a transaction could not depend on blockhash. Can you imagine what could happen on a chain reorg?

&gt; or the original script would have to have more logic that duplicates it when an individual plays the game.

Electricity generation is the process of generating electric power from sources of primary energy. For electric utilities in the electric power industry, it is the first stage in the delivery of electricity to end users, the other stages being transmission, distribution, energy storage and recovery, using pumped-storage methods.

A characteristic of electricity is that it is not a primary energy freely present in nature in remarkable amounts and it must be produced. Production is carried out in power plants.

*In terms of what Id'm doing with my actual BTC, I'm still HODLing, though I did spend some at 11k, and I feel pretty good about that now.

What you should do with your fiat is up to you, and my advice is worth what you paid for it.  But I'd try to wait for 5k and buy there.  Just remember you're speculating, so don't invest more than you can afford to lose.  That way when you're down 50+% you can stay in and not take a loss.

But more importantly, let's say we do find a bad guy. A corrupt politician with 700 BTC in his account, who has a history of trading with Russian campaign accounts.  What can we do?  We can't freeze an account or seize assets in a deregulated ledger. Is our only course of action to arrest him and hope he doesn't flee the country (with all his money...) before we get to him?

"I think my point may have been misunderstood. The government, under a guise of worry that citizens are misappropriating funds, is largely barring crypto. In reality, they're worried of potential setbacks for themselves as their own misappropriation happens, but if funds are taken to a decentralized system, their grasp weakens, hence aiming to protect itself but stating it's for the purpose of protecting citizens. It's early and I'm tired so I may be rambling.",1522677742
"They are not mining invalid blocks, if that protocol has more hashrate it is the real Bitcoin.",1522677730
"&gt;Zcash is not even 3 years old, with each new block ""inflation"" decreases, and it isn't nearly at the inflation levels of other coins (especially premined coins). 

ZCash's current annualized inflation is about 72%, compared with bitcoin's 4.12%, PIVX's 4.62%, or Monero's 8.66%

&gt; The blockchain by is technological definition an auditable supply log, plus along with the Power of Tau Ceremony these concerns are addressed.

Compromised factors are not the only source of hyperinflation.  A bug can also cause this, as happened to ZCoin last March.  The difference being that they have an auditable supply and could see it, and zerocoin's code is more well reviewed and based on more established cryptography.  If you think ""blockchain"" solves this issue, you have some serious research to do on privacy tech

&gt;AFAIK there isn't an ASIC for Zcash, so to say it is miner centralized is a straw-man arguement and doesn't make sense when the biggest threat to decentralization is the crowding-out of individual GPU miners for ASICs and big-box Chinese firms. This is why BTC is broken IMO.

You've really bought into vert's story about ASIC = Centralized when actually it's PoW that is centralized.  Flypool currently holds 61% of ZCash's hashrate.  Vert has a pool with 32% hashrate.  

&gt;FURTHERMORE what is really hilarious is that your PIVX coin literally uses the Zerocoin protocol 

The rest of your post is just demonstrating that you don't understand this coin you immediately hate.  PIVX is (still) the only team to have built zerocoin on PoS.  It is the only coin with deterministic zerocoins and private staking.  If you're not willing to look past the first page of a website your confusion is understandable, but there are plenty of actual clone coins out there for you to direct your frustrations toward",1522677729
"&gt; The reason that they will not cartelize is exhaustively explained in the whitepaper. If you read it, you did not understand it.

Ahhh.... finally you reveal the extent and depth of your understanding, a referral to ""*The Holy Scriptures (TM)*"".

Nice, very nice. Just the kind of discussion a distributed complex system needs, a recourse to authority. Which is not even around anymore! (If that doesn't remind you of religion and ""the word of Christ""... ) I'll excuse myself from that, I'm no good at blindly following, I need to use my brain.

Btw, you are clearly not able to understand that the basic premise of the white paper no longer holds - Every peer is **NOT** a miner anymore, which is what Satoshi envisioned when creating Bitcoin. Needless to say, if the premise does not hold, neither does the conclusion. ~20 miners, that's the number of active pools today, is **a LOT smaller** than the number of banks today. Yet the banks are ""cartelized"". Let me think... no, the miners could never cartelize. Nope. Satoshi said so!!!!



&amp;nbsp;

&gt;S2X/NYA was ""thwarted"" because there was no need for a compromise after BCH was created. 

You clearly do not realise how dumb this is, or you wouldn't have said it. Just to put 1 and 1 together, and NOT rewrite history... S2X/NYA was thwarted and finally abandoned in early *November*. BCH was created in August. Up until November EVERYONE was insisting on S2X/NYA. Even hash power kept signaling. 

So no, BCH had absolutely NOTHING to do with abandoning S2X/NYA The NYA signatories agreed to SegWit AND 2Mb blocks, not a return to 3yrs old technology in the form of an altcoin. It seems very hard to accept for you and the rest of hard core BCH supporters, but the rest of the world really doesn't give much of a shit about BCH. That's not just me saying it to rile you up, or something. If you're completely honest about it, yo'll realise it's true. And the only reason for the increase in merchant adoption is thanks to Bitcoin - It doesn't take much effort to extend the existing infrastructure to support a Bitcoin clone.


The markets are also punishing BCH. This is an absolute fact, which annoys you, but it's true. And by ""punishing"" I don't mean BCH is losing value in fiat terms... rather, BCH is losing value in Bitcoin terms! The price is now ~0.95. Not a month ago it was ~0.12. A month and a half ago it was ~0.15. Early Jan it was ~0.18. And in Dec it was ~0.2. In fact, looking at the overall trend, if you exclude a few obvious pump episodes, the value has been always in decline. So yeah, that's how relevant is BCH in the crypto world.

Then eventually you just try to sell this thing, which does nothing and produces nothing, to someone else for more than you paid for it.  It's not an investment.

"That doesn't work anyway, since the last word is a checksum of the previous ones and there's (almost) no chance to generate a valid seed that way.
If you want to generate damn secure seed, do the following.

- Head to https://iancoleman.io/bip39/ and just save the website onto a usb drive for offline usage.

- Download and burn any linux live system onto another USB drive or CD, I use Ubuntu live system.

- Unplug network cable and shut down your router!

- Boot the live linux system, plug in USB drive with downloaded Ian-Coleman Website and open it with any webrowser

- Tick *Show entropy details* after that choose desired seed length below *Mnemonic length* (I always generate 24 word seeds)

- Throw a dice *one hundred times* and enter each throw in the belonging textbox.

- Copy your created seed carefully by writing in down and safe it securely, at best not in digital form.

- Copy the first bitcoin address shown below for validation purposes later on.

- Shutdown Linux, remove USB drives/CD.

- Start your desired wallet (that supports 24 word seed) and choose *restore* wallet instead of creating a new one.

- Enter your fresh 24 seed words. If that works and there's no error message, you can be sure to have generated a valid seed. Verify that the first receiving address matches the one written down a few step above. If they match your fine.


- Done. You now have a seed that is damn secure as it doesn't rely on any RNG (random number generator) but got its entropy from a truely random process, just throwing a dice.

"Wow, that is a really insightful answer, which leads me to the following questions.

1. Why do bigger blocks increase the size of the blockchain. Aren't the number of transactions responsible for increasing the size of the blockchain? For example, increasing the block size from 1MB to 500 MB right now wouldn't
increase the size of the blockchain more one way or the other. However, if Bitcoin went to say 5x transactions volumes from Dec 2017 (10tps to 50 tps) due to 5x more adoption in a couple of months, then the blockchain would grow 5x faster than in December, while still being able to handle 500x the original tps (5,000 tps). Isn't this good, because this would solve BTC's scalability problem? 
2. Yes, it would make the blockchain grow faster, but is still really such a big deal? Why require all nodes to download the full blockchain, can this not be made optional as in why not establish a optional safebox for bitcoin, where all transactions are saved.  ",1522677362

"Anything that would not have attempted to loot or poach the Bitcoin name.  It was a terrible marketing strategy as it instantly created and incentivized ill-will amongst a huge number of crypto users.  Whether you believe the ""but it's more aligned with the original whitepaper"" argument or not, it doesn't matter.  The strategy to steal away the Bitcoin brand instantly created a direct effort to marginalize Bcash.  BCash is not a derogatory description of the Bitcoin Cash name.  Had it been adopted and embraced, and thereby disarmed this stupid narrative, it could have led to this chain's success.  Branding it as BCash would not have created sucha large anti user base.   If it had been marketed as BCash and focus was spent on emphasizing the positive aspects of the chain, it would have run into much less resistance.  Later there might have been the potential to be able to adopt the Bitcoin name at a later date.  By the point BCash might have created sufficient user support however, adopting the Bitcoin brand likely would not have been necessary since by that point.   BCash would have been standing on its own merits.  There is no denying tha this project has been driven by Roger Ver and he has been able to drive the projects narrative.  His disdain for supporters of the original Bitcoin chain and some of its developers has blinded him from taking the proper strategy which might have lead to BCash's success.  ",1522675837

"Exactly. It all depends on how you want to see it. In my original post, I'm trying to point out that the literal capacity is in BTC, not USD. If we were to imagine the network as a bag or bucket of sand, you wouldn't claim it had $20 worth of sand; it would have several pounds of sand.

I get why people want to immediately translate BTC to dollars. I was just thinking in a more direct way, I guess",1522674392
"It looks like no one has actually answered your questions to let me give it a go.

•How can it scale so high as a POW coin?

First off, the 72,000 tps on Pascalcoin is entirely theoretical. Pascalcoin has seen a tps of 153 on the main-net, but that is by no means the max that the network can handle. There has yet to be an official stress test on the network as far as I know.

The tps on Pascalcoin is only limited by the network, just like NANO. Pascalcoin achieves their scaleability through the safebox architecture. The safebox only holds the last one hundred blocks of the blockchain, thus allowing for much larger block sizes than a traditional blockchain. When a block is larger, it is able to hold more transactions, giving Pascalcoin the ability to handle several tps.

The whole larger blocksize has been a constant headache to scaleability, the most notable being the fork between BTC and BCH. It has always been a trade off between short-term and long-term scaleability. This is because in a traditional blockchain, the nodes have to keep records of ALL the blocks. When the block becomes larger, that means more hard drive space is taken up on each node. Short-term, you get a network that can handle more tps. Long-term, it becomes too much hard drive storage for the nodes. This causes the nodes to become centralized because not many people will be able to afford the costs of larger and larger hard drive space. In this way, the safebox eliminates this hard drive space constraint by only requiring each node to store the last 100 blocks. As an example, safebox technology lets a new node be run using less than 30MB

And as for the second part of the question, they don’t lose decentralization or security for their speed.

•They also have deletable blockchain with a safebox for the balances, is this good or bad and does this mean, that this is privacy by default then?

The safebox is hosted and accounted for by everyone that runs a node. It’s not one central authority or entity. It is also an OPTIONAL feature. Nodes are allowed to keep track of the full blockchain if they so desire. This means that a company can still store several years worth of blockchain for accounting purposes. Privacy is not by default. Your account transactions don’t suddenly disappear because they aren’t on the last one hundred blocks. They can still be stored by throes nodes who wish to keep full records Remember, safebox tech is just a way for people to run nodes using less hard drive space if they so desire.

Is it good or bad? I think it’s a good option, and I don’t see any downsides to it. Some people may question the security of it, but as far as I can tell, it is just as secure as any other blockchain. This is because each node makes sure the safebox RS are honest, just like each node makes sure the records are honest in bitcoin.

•It seems that no one has heard of Pascalcoin before, why is that?

Who knows? For a long time there was only one developer that doesn’t speak English. They really don’t have a good logo, a catchy name, or any marketing. It has had severe problems with ETH dual mining, causing mining centralization. There are also barriers to adoption (having to buy an account). That stuff is all being worked on by the team, but it takes time.

The coin is legit. There are many more features being added that will make it more than just a high tps, 0 fee coin.",1522674355
"Bitcoin was never meant to be run by everyone, but used by everyone. The guy that estimated 25m reassessed the calculations and it came out at 1 million. That’s at today’s prices and that is also at maximum adoption, that’s 50 tx a day per person for every person on the planet. At the point that we would need that level of hardware we can reasonably expect the price to be considerably lower. At full adoption levels there’s every reason to believe there would be more nodes than there are today in btc. 

Just think about what you’re a saying. At global scale we would be dependent on a just a few nodes and we would be beholden to them.... what? Would not every large Corp all over the world have at least one node? Are you aware of how big the world is lol.

"So many issues with Verge, that if the partnership is real we should really start thinking about the market as a whole. My known issues with Verge:

- the ""optional privacy"" feature is not private at all. Stealth addresses are known to grant only forward privacy and are subject to blockchain analysis

- hiding IP addresses is a nice to have feature, but you can do this with VPN or TOR or I2P on your own with every coin

- the dev is a liar, simple as that. Claims from the whitepaper are plain wrong (there is no private ledger, no transaction vanishes, that's not how stealth addresses work). He promised privacy audits, has said he got two back but they did not satisfy his needs. What?! Who did he ask for these audits and is it possible they also said what I claim since the release of Warith Protocol? Why doesn't he let his ""vergefam"" decide and publishes them? I bet there are no audits.

- he breaks copyrights and lies again: he copied the ""opaque address"" feature and claims to have invented it. Usual answer: ""lol, copied from 2015 shitcoin, who cares?!"" (the author of the code could shut down the github repo immediately if he wants too...)

- he risks users privacy. If somebody relies on the tech, and we know it is not private at all at 2018 standard, the user can come into serious problems.

- the 3 million $ funding for an announcement on 26th of march. Funding went through, and there is again no announcement. Postponed, people hyping up again, but with all the flaws mentioned above: which company doing their research would not see this? An amateurish developed crypto lead by a notorious liar not living up to its promises while keeping almost no deadline?

Verge is a perfect example for the cryptomarket: pure gambling. And if the partner relies on privacy this will be a real mess in no time since every transaction to this partner, e.g. pornhub, could be tagged through the blockchain. See BlockSci for an open source tool already able to do this with several coins, not trivial, but no problem for the educated IT guy.

My guess for the announcement: some unknown or minor company sold as ""THE BIG THING"" with ""SO MUCH POTENTIAL!!1"".

"Okay, few things people in this thread are really missing out on: You need to have channels open to use Lightning, so the experience will change for the end user in one of two ways:

1. They choose/the wallet chooses to run in ""autopilot"" mode, where it automatically opens channels as it sees fit to allocate a percentage of your money onto the network.
2. They choose/the wallet chooses to wait until it's making a lightning channel transaction, then if it is unable to find a route, generate a new channel that would create a route
3. The same as #2 but also allocate extra money for ""next time""

The UI will look basically identical as current, except you'll use Lightning invoices rather than Bitcoin addresses, and, depending on the above situation:

1. You'll notice your BTC balance will occasionally drop a bit, reflecting the price it costs to open channels. If you try and spend too much (I.E. If you have 1BTC total, 0.5BTC on chain and 0.5BTC in payment channels, and you try and spend 0.75BTC) you'll get either an error or something that says ""We have to delay this payment while we create more/remove some payment channels""
2. Lightning won't be instant the first time you route to anyone, but if you then get paid through Lightning you'll then be able to make your next payment faster. Same issue occurs if you don't have enough funds on chain/in payment channels, you'll have to wait to close/open some channels. This has the benefit of your balance not randomly dropping though.
3. Lightning won't be instant the first time you route to people, but the more payments you make the faster it will get, other than that, same as #2.

At-least, that's my understanding of it.",1522671165

"&gt; You just claim that BCH must be centralised without any explanation.

Elementary my dear BenIntrepid.  Bitcoin is suppose to be fit for global consumption.  Visa is a milestone not a end result.  Let's just say the goal is being able to support gigabyte blocks.  

When you take into account hardware costs.  Really only very wealthy individuals would be able to run btrash.  Leading again to a situation where many depend on a few.  The unbanked would be reliant on wealthy to run bitcoin.  This is unacceptable. Bitcoin should have some manner in which the unbanked can run full nodes.  A bitcoin that can run over satellites, radio waves, mesh networks etc.  A bitcoin that is easy to spin up in a disaster situation.  

 &gt; In their current sizes BTC would be more decentralised than BCH. But as there are more users more merchants, there would naturally be more nodes and more miners.

Wealthier people will tend to run full nodes.  Bcash discourages full nodes.  Miners don't really matter according to bcashers.  Mining pools matter.  They are the only ones that write to the blockchain.  If you make it so that only pools run full nodes and that full nodes are difficult and expensive to spin up.  Creating a new pool becomes problematic.  If one is shutdown it's not so easy for a guy in his garage to spin one up and offer some more competition.

&gt;Regarding 2 factions, sorry my friend this is complete dogshite. BTC crowd are quite content to felate the state. BCHers are not. I’m glad I could clear that up for you.

[I'm sorry what?](https://youtu.be/64E8FzUd0no?t=163)

You do the math even gigabyte blocks really doesn't allow us to compete with visa's peak tx rate.  It doesn't get us to the world stage.  It really maxes out that scale vector and doesn't even accomplish the goal.  You'd need another few orders of magnitude to do that.  So terabyte blocks.  There are people here in this sub who support terabyte blocks for btrash.  They did the math and estimated it'd cost 25 million to run a pool.  Who can afford 25 mil?  Banks, corps, and governments.  Rich people who own corps.

"This is a fun and interesting article. The explanatory para “from these ... to store.” Is wrong. A key converted to binary could be converted to a DNA sequence of the DNA letters A, G, C, T. There would be no need to convert this to a protein sequence. Multiple copies of this DNA sequence could be produced and stored together or in different places (decentralised). DNA is very stable but can undergo mutation where the sequence will change. But the changes occur in different places in different copies of the sequence so the bitcoin key would be the consensus sequence derived from comparing the multiple stored copies. I don’t honestly see the advantage of this compared with keeping information digitally in electronic code. In future it could be possible for individuals to take a small amount of their stored DNA and sequence it  to read off the key, which again would be the consensus sequence.

Inserting your DNA key into your own DNA is science fiction at the moment and would not be allowed by the FDA etc given the problems with gene therapy trials over the decades. It is simply not necessary to do this. The DNA key could be inserted into somatic cells (ie not reproductive cells) to avoid it being passed on to next generation. The problem though is that if the sequence is inserted into your own DNA, mutation will still occur and it may be quite difficult to derive a consensus sequence. 

Clearly this kind of technique is interesting and available if you want to tag one of your possessions with a pre-determined DNA sequence eg your ipad, then if it is stolen, DNA sequenced from a swab could reveal that your are the owner. With crypto the use is not so clear to me.",1522668181

"No, exchange rates are built at millions of stock exchanges all over the world, and billions of traders actually do transactions based upon these rates. This is not centralized information.

It is a matter of fact that BTC will be ""yet another"" currency in the world for the foreseeable future, so everybody must have the chance to know how much they can buy the next day for their BTC to use it regularly.

Why does it work you may say? Because they create a mesh, a chaotic system that is hard to interfere with.

So yeah people don't want to deal with the keys or deal with the tecnhology if there is no upside. Pay them though, give them an additional salary to the one they have and see them suddenly caring about the tech side as well.

It's like direct democracy, only with monetized incentives. All nodes vote on what the next block will be. Pay them enough, diversify them enough and you have a damn near impregnable system.

Well, these are the very people we should talk about when it comes to adoption. We are savvy users, some of us code, run companies and are crypto enthusiasts.

I recently tried to convert about 6 BTC using Changelly.com. It's not the first time I used their site. I have used it before, a couple months ago, and without issues. Now, with my most recent transaction they suddenly put the transaction on hold AFTER i sent the coins. Their system didn't even send a message about that. I had to email them and they replied it was put on hold because my transaction looked suspicious and was put on hold because of that.

They said we needed to follow a multi-step KYC procedure in order to release the funds.

So I sent them a picture of me holding my ID card and a paper reading ""changelly"" as they requested. I sent it to them and they replied I also need to send official proof of the original funds. I need to proof I'm the rightful owner of these funds.

I mined those coins back in 2011 and I looked everywhere but can't find anything that can proof this. I haven't keept track of all that shit back in the days. I did find an old email backup but couldn't find emails from mining pools or anything anymore. I probably deleted it years ago already.

The past years I have converted these coins to other coins many times a year and I always used sites like changelly, shapeshift, mortphtoken, xmr.to, coinswitch, flyp.me,.... I have used many sites in the past, depending on their rates. But I never kept track of these transactions so I can't really proof anything now.

In 2015 I also won some coins on a gambling site but that site does no longer exist. Those coins are all in one wallet at a certain point in time. I did find a screenshot of that page in my old emails. I sent it to Changelly too.

But how am I supposed to proof that I'm the owner of my coins now? I don't have a complete transaction history leading to a point where I can proof ownership at all.

I already explained this whole story to Changelly last friday. But they haven't replied to it yet and this is worrying me very much.

Are they allowed to just keep my funds for such a long time, like they are doing to me now?",1522663558

"It can't.  Well, it can, but first BTC needs to hit zero and then outside investment needs to come in to the other coins to lift them from the pyre.  

The above has two big problems.  Most new investment money (which is extremely sparse) is going straight into BTC and not moving into alts.  Also, why would you put your money into anything else?  What amazing new tech is there among the alts?  Be honest!  There's nothing that can't be done by the commercial sector for free, why would they pay to use a blockchain when they can just make their own blokchain?  No reason.  VEN and it's tracking has already been btfo by several companies doing the same with their very own blockchain that has zero investment.  Not that VEN coin would ever see any profit from the VEN tracking, but regardless it's a non-starter.

A few cash coins that adhere more to probable regulation will retain value - XRP and XLM are the obvious two.  ETH is about to die (killed by ICO) as too many ICOs hold too much ETH and are more than capable of tanking it at any time - if ETH stops looking like ever starting to climb, several of those ICOs will look to liquidate their positions.  

The main point of crypto is as an alternative currency.  So far it has failed and there's nothing on the horizon that looks set to reverse the decline.  Face it, it was easier to spend BTC in January 2017 than it is currently.  

What you should really be saying is 'it's about time BTC was decoupled from fiat currency'.  Only by getting people to see BTC as being more valuable and a preferred trade to fiat currency will it become easier to spend BTC - and other cryptos.

"The limited supply principal only affects coin value. For many coin use-cases, coin value is not important to functionality. Cryptocurrency is expected to change the world in many ways. Only a few ways require a significant coin value to achieve success. 

The seemingly most important use-case (Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash) will need a stable or rising value to achieve success. Those coins with a limited number of coins will have value (and be a store of value) if they are adopted and used by large numbers of people for the use-case(s) of that coin. It seems unlikely a large number of different coins will be adopted and used by large numbers of people since a few (at most) of the best coins will take over most of the marketshare for each of the significant use cases. So, I see no need to worry about the number of different cryptocoins so long as you own the coin(s) that the most people adopt for the use-case(s) you care about.

So, for instance, it seems Bitcoin Cash will be adopted as the best Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash for the people of the world since BTC developers seem to have given up on that use case. Another coin may compete for that use-case's marketshare and Bitcoin Cash may be in for some tough competition if any other coin grows that kind of adoption faster than Bitcoin Cash. I have not heard anything solid about that happening for any other cryptocoin so far. So, I'm saying the large number of other kinds of coins will not control the value of a BCH unless they also have a significant part of the Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash use-case adoption. And, I am saying very few other cryptocoins will be used as Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash by significant numbers of the world's people. So, the unlimited number of other coins should not be a concern or stop the implementation of a worldwide Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System since most of them will not get adopted for that use.",1522662171

Bitcoin Core is certainly a very different project, hell it was actually the main argument for segwit implementation in the first place. (Bitcoin is fundamentally broken, it’s economics model need to be changed to digital gold)

As BTC is diferent from Bitcoin and the economics change has been pushed very hard only by one team (Bitcoin core)

It is legitimate to call it Bitcoin Core IMO.

&gt;It is unfortunate that this reddit is called r/btc because that is misleading by any standard.

Only rbitcoin is to blamed for that.

"&gt; AFAIK they also have the option to keep the BCH/BTC.   ...business that have cost in BTC/BCH will take the cryptocurrency.

With bitcoin's volatility, accepting crypto payments would be suicide.  Legal merchants work with narrow profit margins, 10% or less.  The merchant's revenue from sales may lose half its value when it is time to pay the staff and utilities bills.  Not to mention the $25 or more transaction fee *on each sale or bill payment*...

Face it: as a payment system, bitcoin is shit. (Sorry for the language, but that is the most accurate technical term.)

Criminals use bitcoin because they have no other choice, and are used to pay huge fees and deep discounts to money laundering middlemen.  If the price of a drug on a DNM is already 100 times its production cost, it does not matter if the payment system puts a 100% penalty plus a $100 fee for several rounds of mixing...

&gt; [Credit cards] with sometime huge fees and poor exchange rate.

That's not the point.  The point is that a merchant who ""accepts bitcoin"" through BitPay does NOT actually accept bitcoin.   There are VERY few legal merchants that actually ""accept bitcoin"".  Not sure Overstock still accepts it...

(But, by the way, BitPay charges fees too.  When the BTC transaction fees were $25 or more,BitPay charged that from the consumer, too.)

If BTC continue the route of digital gold, there will be little to no use for nodes, there is no need to run a nodes if you only HODL.

&gt;If transaction fees become so large that it would be a significant portion of the btc payout then btc has failed (before around 2040 at least). 

It had already happened during Sep-Nov-Dec. only extremely large and profitable mining operations were able to not loose all their profit on transactions fees.

Killing small miner operations.

"**SegWit**

Segregated Witness, or SegWit, is the name used for an implemented soft fork change in the transaction format of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, which has also been implemented on currencies such as Litecoin, DigiByte and Vertcoin.

The formal title ""Segregated Witness (Consensus layer)"" had Bitcoin Improvement Proposal number BIP141. The purpose was to solve malleability. It was also intended to mitigate a blockchain size limitation problem that reduces Bitcoin transaction speed.

***

**Lightning Network**

The Lightning Network is a ""second layer"" payment protocol that operates on top of a blockchain (most commonly Bitcoin). It enables instant transactions between participating nodes and has been touted as a solution to the bitcoin scalability problem. It features a peer-to-peer system for making micropayments of digital cryptocurrency through a network of bidirectional payment channels without delegating custody of funds and minimizing trust of third parties.

Normal use of the Lightning Network consists of opening a payment channel by committing a funding transaction to the relevant blockchain, followed by making any number of Lightning transactions that update the tentative distribution of the channel's funds without broadcasting to the blockchain, followed by closing the payment channel by broadcasting the final version of the transaction to distribute the channel's funds.

&gt;No, they don't.  The merchants do not handle the bitcoin in any way, and don't even know what the price is in bitcoin.

AFAIK they also have the option to keep the BCH/BTC.

&gt;When you click ""pay with Bitcoin"" on a merchant's site, your browser is redirected to the BitPay server.  BitPay converts the item's price from USD (as specified by the merchant) to BTC, at its chosen rate, and displays it to you.  You send the bitcoins to Bitpay (not to the merchant).  BitPay then sends USD to the merchant by bank transfer. 

&gt;So BitPay is just a convenient way to sell your bitcoins and use the USD to pay on-line merchants.  A merchant who subscribes to BitPay and agrees to put up a ""Bitcoin Accepted"" sign is not really accepting bitcoin. He is just subscribing to another USD payment processor.

I know, I don’t see a problem with that.

Typically business that have cost in Fiat payment will take Fiat payback, and business that have cost in BTC/BCH will take the cryptocurrency.

"I agree that being invested for upcoming 2-5 years could potentially be very rewarding.

Realistic people know this isn't a 3-month-get-rich thing. People saw the succes story of BTC going from mere cents to ~20k, however forget how long it took to get there. I woildn't be surprised that +90% of who bought in were expecting some massive gains within months.",1522657574
"I did exactly the same 5 years ago for my daughter who was then 5 weeks old. I intended to give the bitcoin to her when she would turn 18 years. Last year september I decided it would be better to cash and invest elsewhere, since this thing was going way too fast. 18 years is a very, very long time and I would urge you to reevaluate your decision at least once a year.",1522657521
"Hah, ETH is currently at price it should be after completely insanely irrational pump 2017.  Will be lucky to merely keep up with BTC once both start heading upwards again about 2 weeks from now.",1522657461
Only those hoping to make money from speculation will lose interest.  BTC was working fine as a currency before all these spikes.,1522657457
"You do it again: You make up your own storyline which fits your narrative.

Let me be superclear: The Majority of cryptoinvestors/developers/miners/traders/hodlers/space/industry/regulators choose btc over bch. With your capacity you want to start the blockdebate again, stop it, you lost. 8 mb blocks are not enough to service the whole world and lightning as it is now also not. Both is a solution to get to the next level of adoption, but the Majority of the space has choosen the btc path.



Why is is so hard for people like you to you to admit that? ",1522657442

"I think you are underestimating people's desire for wealth and material gains. If bitcoin continues to have massive bull runs and  reaches 50,000 in the next few years, people will go through all of that shit just to use crypto. Bitcoin isn't perfect, but right now (and most likely in the future) it will continue to be the king.",1522657400
"Fiat isn't money... 

Most people have never touch sound money... 

Bitcoin will be the greatest transfer of wealth from the tiny elite (50-70 people who own the world).

All that talk about the *one percent* is nonsense. ",1522657267
"I think you're missing my point. I'm saying it's not easy for people to use crypto yet. As a merchant you're helping, but we are no where near the point where using crypto is easy. 

Case in point, if I want to spend btc right here and now, I need knowledge of how to send btc from my exchange to some wallet on my phone, then well... I can't even continue onto the next step because I guarantee you not a single store in my city accepts btc let alone any crypto. ",1522657244

"&gt; This. Its arrogant to think that your opinion is more important than the **majority**. 

I think you missed my point: the **majority** are physically unable to use BTC. There is simply not enough capacity. Fees went down: not because of batching or segwit, but because people are leaving the system in droves.

"You don't need to explain mate. All that has happened in the last 3 months is that the set of bitcoin haters has increased to include other crypto currencies that think btc is not letting them go back their previous value, under a delusion that they had some value to begin with.

I don’t really care about him, why should I?

&gt;At what point does ver get held accountable? 

You at rbitcoin have developed a wierd fetich with Ver.

Now you guys radically change Bitcoin (with questionable methods) and you are surprised he doesn’t support your fork?

Get over it.",1522656905
"&gt; If you think it's grandma easy then you're absolutely out of your mind

I don't think you have used many wallets or even grasp basic concepts.

There is no need to understand fees when they are pennies and transactions are instant for most coins.

You want to get Bitcoin easy. Go to coinbase. That's simple enough. As far as fluctuations, that requires adoption first.

I think you have already decided something is too hard without actually thinking about solutions. You are talking to someone who has actually set up merchants and its easy. ",1522656883

It's both.  You could just hold your wealth in crypto instead of fiat bank account.,1522656839
"Have you ever considered that other coins never had value in the first place and people were just buying them to increase their btc? The currency number used to buy something is not its value, how is this concept so difficult to get. And in case noone noticed, every shitcoin is very well decoupled from btc except fiat controlled countries in the west. Tell me how ripple is not crashing in Korea and India because they have multiple exchanges to directly buy it with fiat lol",1522656778
"The real truth is that BMO realised they have disastrously poor security system, easy to hack and use their client money to buy crypto.

Huh? Trust me mate I or the consensus is never calling bitcoin cash bitcoin lol. Good lick with this vision hahha,1522656222

"Well OP explicitly cited “lambos and moons” which were words literally thrown around this sub daily 4 months ago. Nobody in investing is anticipating their stock portfolio to “moon” &gt; 1 year, so it’s safe to say that a quite loud layer of this sub was irrational, delusional, or had crypto as their first form of real investment. 

But kudos to everybody I **do** see in here doing the research, hanging on, and *investing* wisely. They will see great gains in the next 5-20 years I feel. ",1522655968
"You realize that its an excellent attack vector right? If you start to rely on 0-conf you can attack with, say 5%, hashpower and ""destroy trustworthiness"" of the coin as you say.

Honest miners wont ofc, but 5% hashpower is just 0.5% btc hashpower to put it in perspective, and then theres governments with other incentived, or miners who think they can gain by just shorting on exchanges (they can always mine btc still).",1522655903

"In house Blockchain technologies aren’t necessarily tokens or currencies. They use the same tech but you can always create one free from a token. IBM offers Blockchain as a service and they’re charging fiat to create that system for companies. 

While Blockchain is an amazing technology that doesn’t necessarily mean tokens will enjoy the same. Tokens represent a threat to the financial system, not because anyone will lose. What is stopping JP Morgan or BofA from making their own token and forcing it on their customers? They already get away with enough as it is? 

The reality is, cryptocurrencies represent a threat to the financial system not as a finance tool, but as a means of stripping political power from the corrupt. They’re can no longer be shady deals and offshore accounts. Everything would be in public view and this is what they’re afraid of. 

You can silence an investigative journalist by paying him or the company he works for a bunch of hush money, but when they’re dealings are out in the open and exposed there is nowhere left to run or hide. 

Ask yourselves, why haven’t banks created their own crypto? They would have more to benefit than to gain. ",1522655536

"&gt;Bitcoin (segwit) is of no use to me because I can not afford the transaction fees. I signed up for the vision outlined in Satoshi's original white-paper.

In december I would agree with you, but with segwit and batching the fees went down to under 10 sat/byte, which I think is a decent fee if you look at the average transaction value. 

&gt;The people using threats, subterfuge, and censorship to proclaim ""1MB4ever!"" have painted themselves into a corner. The have eliminated the ""long tail"" from the system.

This. Its arrogant to think that your opinion is more important than the **majority**. Lets not have the blockdebate again, we had it and bigger blocks lost. I am sorry to point it out, but there is nothing which shows that the majortiy wants bigger blocks. There is less development in BCH, less mining (security) and the price is less than 10% than the real Bitcoin. You guys tried to make a case for it, and you lost is mostly because of your aggressive marketing. 

I tried to tell you guys that most people were not against bigger blocks in the beginning, most people I personally know just really dislike the approach BCH took, its a maliciousness approach in most peoples mind and people like Roger Ver, fake satoshi and this pedophile from Island are not people I want to follow. They all have a history of being very selfish, egocentric people who have no problem with criminal behavior in their past. 

I am just the messenger here and tell you what a lot of people think, dont hate me for it, I try to stay decent, I am not calling it btrash or bcash because I understand that just triggers people and wont lead to any healthy discussion.

"You just claim that BCH must be centralised without any explanation. And decentralisation is not Boolean. It’s not either decentralised or centralised and nothing in between. In their current sizes BTC would be more decentralised than BCH. But as there are more users more merchants, there would naturally be more nodes and more miners.

Regarding 2 factions, sorry my friend this is complete dogshite. BTC crowd are quite content to felate the state. BCHers are not. I’m glad I could clear that up for you.

"I don't think those ads reflected well on the crypto community or blockchain. There's a chance that they did it to suppress the markets for the time being to slow growth, either because they have their own ideas, they fear a competitor rising, or someone powerful doesn't like crypto for other reasons. It makes sense that they would want things to stay the same since they are all very successful right now. There will be a point that they reverse their decision and use all the networking influence they have to shill their chosen coins (""this is extremely dangerous to our democracy"") and overnight in normies minds crypto changes from a meme that got some tech nerds really rich to a legitimate asset that might deserve a place in an investment portfolio.

"Tax only applies to those who submit themselves to KYC procedures or use the banking system to handle their fiat transfers. This is fine if you want to benefit from the convenience of slick trading platforms which you get from an organized exchange. 

But it need not be this way. 

Yes it is a hassle to buy bitcoin anonymously from total strangers using cash. However, it is a hassle which allows you to create a totally untraceable bitcoin saving pot which no one will ever take away from you, not even through taxation.

Once you have untraceable bitcoin, there are many platforms allowing you to trade crypto-to-crypto and which do not require any form of KYC.

If Bitcoin goes to 10k tomorrow

""I was so excited that my order was filled at 7k that as soon as I got home I got another 50 bitcoins at $6800"".

I figured you must be so tired from that cruise and you have so much catching up to do, that I would help with the next chapters in the story book.

There's 7 billion people on earth. So in order to grow we need a solution to scale. Bitcoin is very strongly betting on Lightning as their solution to scale. BCH is betting on 0-conf + bigger blocks.
