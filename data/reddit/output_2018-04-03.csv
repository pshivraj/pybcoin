"&gt; The orphan sounds scary in theory, but when you run actual numbers for the actual miners out there, the end result ends up being negliable - compact blocks and X-thin already solved most of the propagation problem for blocks up to 100mb+, and Graphene will solve it for much larger sizes. Similar scale as the issue of air friction when trying to walk.

Bandwidth saving solutions don't necessarily reduce propagation time as significantly as they impact bandwidth, as these techniques increase the number of roundtrips required. They do all tend to reduce latency slightly in the grand scheme, but not to such a degree that 100mb+ blocks are not a problem. Xthin is practically the same protocol as compact, and graphene's compression techniques give very little (arguably negligible) improvement over compact blocks in regards to bandwidth, and probably don't provide any advantage in regards to latency. The only substantial difference between the two is that a bloom filter is sent in the block header instead of a list of transaction IDs. Yes, this reduces the size of the initial attempt to propagate a block, but the percent change vs the *whole* block is extremely tiny, and the trade off is that the client needs to do a little bit of extra processing to use the filter, which would probably end up eliminating any latency advantage created by the slightly reduced bandwidth cost, if not making latency slightly worse. It doesn't reduce the bulk of the source of latency which is hops and transactions.

But Graphene is really two completely distinct objects which happen to have been published in a single paper by the same authors. The use of bloom filters in the head of a compact block-style protocol has its advantages and disadvantages, but overall isn't that huge of a change. The much more radical change proposed in the Graphene paper is a reworking of the gossip network such that blocks are propagated through the whole network *before* its verified by the node sending it. Its true, this would virtually solve the latency problem. You could then scale blocks to any size and latency could be reasonably compared to wind resistance when running. It would still give large miners *some* advantage, but it'd be so negligible that that it wouldn't really be an issue worth considering. However, this change isn't suitable for Bitcoin because it does not function well in an adversarial environment. It introduces a glaring vulnerability, in that any node or number of nodes could spam the network with bogus blocks and their only barrier would be to doing this would be the storage required to build a node and the small amount of bandwidth required to send out fake blocks. Where as in the Bitcoin network these blocks would die as soon as they hit another node, the Graphene network would have them propagate through the entire network.

&gt; Block propagation has very little to do with transaction propagation. The data that is unique to the block and wasn't already propagated as a transaction is very small, and modern set reconciliation solves this issue completely. Read more on the Graphene block propagation protocol.

You're assuming that a given node will already have all of the transactions of a block in its pool prior to receiving notification of the block. This is not always the case, and if you increase the number of transactions per second occurring on the network, you increase the likelihood that a given node will receive a block containing transactions it has not received or validated yet. Set reconciliation (such as in compact blocks) doesn't solve this problem, it merely allows nodes to detect when it occurs without receiving a copy of every transaction in the block by the sender. 

So *because of contemporary set reconciliation techniques* transaction propagation actually has quite a bit to do with block propagation.

&gt; This requirement is optional. Just like any layer-2 or other solution can choose to not store it, so can layer-1 full nodes choose to run in pruned mode without any loss in security.

You can choose to prune the blockchain *after* you've validated the entire blockchain. Which means you will need to allocate enough space for the entire blockchain at least initially. After that, nodes can choose to delete old blocks if they'd like, but the initial barrier to entry remains.

&gt; The correct number is more likely around 4.5gb, as indicated by the Terab project.

Yep. I was being purposefully conservative. Even just looking at Visa's trx volume and ball parking it gets you closer to 3.5.

&gt;  Currently, the costs of a node of that capacity is in the realm of ""affordable to business""

That's a bit subjective. Yes, its affordable to some businesses, but there are many that cant cover that overhead. Scaling blocks to that size effectively increases the cost of spinning up a node without trust/centralization by about $5k/year. 

&gt; but it is expected to be affordable to consumers within 20 years as well.

I'd need to see that elucidated to believe it. Are you assuming that the cost of storage will decay exponentially forever, while also assuming that the demand for transaction volume for a payment processing network will stay static? That's hard for me to believe, both because I don't see demand for transactions staying still, and because, should a payment processing system that requires immense storage become popular, the demand for storage created by vendors would drive the price of storage up.",1522824492

"**Gaslighting**

Gaslighting is a form of manipulation that seeks to sow seeds of doubt in a targeted individual or in members of a targeted group, hoping to make them question their own memory, perception, and sanity. Using persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, and lying, it attempts to destabilize the target and delegitimize the target's belief.

Instances may range from the denial by an abuser that previous abusive incidents ever occurred up to the staging of bizarre events by the abuser with the intention of disorienting the victim. The term owes its origin to the 1938 Patrick Hamilton play Gas Light and its 1940 and 1944 film adaptations.

"If he chooses a side that is consistent with what he was saying for years before the advent of Blockstream, I'd have no problem. It's simply clear as day that he's now as hypocritical as most in the small-block contingent, and that's fine too. As you say, he's a human being that's free to choose his own actions. But the question was why is there now less fawning over Andreas than before, and I provided my response.  

I'm afraid I don't have links to evidence that he now bans users on Twitter and stays away from Reddit, but if you'll search this subreddit, I'm sure you'll find it.  

If you truly believe that /r/BTC is more toxic than /r/Bitcoin, then I can't help you except to say most claims that this is the case are simply [gaslighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting). Take the time to observe interactions in both subs yourself, then decide. That /r/BTC has public, open mod logs and does not ban users without legitimate reason is incontrovertible. /r/Bitcoin will not even allow posts asking why they don't open their own mod logs or asking why they censor on their own sub. That they have permanently banned thousands of users almost entirely without cause and that this behavior continues to this day is so recognized, that they attempted to make light of their own reputation by ""banning"" everyone as a joke for this past April Fool's. Ha ha, very funny.  

Yet, if Andreas is happy to be a hypocritical small-blocker now, I think that's just fine. We don't need pretender advocates in our camp espousing positions that they don't really believe in. But now he also shouldn't try to ingratiate himself with those that have consistently supported full and open discussion, and who will denounce censorship and unethical action whenever its observed.

The year is 2038 and everyone is using Crypto. I go to the store and I pay with crypto, I go to my friends house and he tosses me some coin. Everything is great.

It's my Bitcoin wallet from when I was a kid in 2023, and it has all my past transactions. I gulp in fear, as she scrolls through the list to the one I hoped she wouldn't find - the time I bought someone else a wedding ring.

It wasn't my fault.. I didn't know my wife at the time. How was I going to explain that? I never told her I was engaged.. I didn't mean to lie, but it just never really came up. I panicked and froze as she looked at me and screamed ""It's true!??"" - I didn't know what to do.

The blockchain never forgets. When crypto adoption goes wild, there's nothing stopping governments and insurance agencies scanning your texts/emails to determine which address is yours. They line up all your transactions and can serve you better ads, learn where you like to shop etc etc.. Basically everything that already happens today.

Except now it's not just the government, it's *everyone*.

Even if you're not doing something illegal, you're putting your transaction up for the world to see. That's why I think every blockchain crypto will eventually adopt some form of privacy :)",1522823564

"&gt; One blockchain for each pool? 
One view of the blockchain per pool, they diverge when the selfish miner gets a lead and converge on reorg.

&gt; Not sure what you mean updated and reorg'd.
If the pool wins their chain is updated accordingly. Any time the honest chain is longer, the selfish miner abandons his chain no matter the state. The selfish miner hides his chain, only causing the honest chain to reorg after having gained and subsequently lost a lead.

&gt;  obviously you cant amass that much hashing power on BCH or BTC - so (if you're not already doing so) objectively recreate your expirement on a new genesis block bitcoin clone with a 33 hashing ratio and show the 33% miner getting 45% of the blocks by abusing selfish mining

I've simplified the blocks since i don't need transactions for the simulation, but do perform the chaining by including the previous block hash. I also perform double sha256 hashing. Obviously the difficulty is set low, but it should not affect the outcome.

&gt; Can you link me to any of these tests? 

It's embarrassingly sloppy, but it does the trick.

      elsif target == :s
        lead += 1
      end

      return lead, hide
    end

    iterations.times do |i|

      chains = {  h:[], s:[] }
      hide = true
      lead = 0

      rounds.times do
        # select a chain at random

      # force reorg without hiding as if selfish miner is calling it quits
      reorg(chains, :h, lead, false)

      # collect the counts
      s = chains[:h].map{|b| b[0]}.count('s').to_f
      h = chains[:h].map{|b| b[0]}.count('h').to_f

"So then why would he continue to remain in the public realm, including in Reddit and appearing on YouTube proclaiming with considerable enthusiasm that this is something big and it's coming. 

Just to put the record straight, I am a fairly astute traditional and crypto investor. I am invested in BTC, NEO. ETH and then dabble around in ""interesting"" coins/tokens. I last held a bag of Verge prior to NYE, I was of the opinion and still believe had WP been successfully released on the stroke of midnight then Verge would have risen close to $2. Of course, it didn't happen but Justin Sunerok Vendetta did come up with the goods in the weeks which followed. 

I began following Sunerok prior to WP and have watched him closely including his work rate on GitHub. I know the type of alternative music he listens to, I believe he may be a graffiti artist, and above all I believe he has a social and moral compass. 

I am invested right now in Verge because I believe in Sunerok. He has more about him than most on this subreddit are willing to give him credit for and I like to back people I believe in. Maybe the corporate partner sees in him what I see? If Justin delivers the goods this time he and Verge will finally be taken seriously.

Today, I manage everything from my mobile wallet. I scan invoices which are digitally read using the OCR line from my mobile bank app. I transfer money to friends with mobile pay using their phone numbers instead of account numbers and I can trade stocks and bonds with a few clicks.

Companies that are able to adapt and are aware of disruptional technologies can embrace them and to some extend use them. They eventually have organizational problems if they only adapt tech, though.

You're telling users and developers that the rules, usage, and mechanics of the cryptocurrency can change at any time in the future.

I'm not saying that all hard forks are bad, but I'm just making a case for why *not* hard forking can be good. We've seen very few layer-2 systems on top of cryptocurrencies, with Lightning Network still in its infancy.

The two week lag in difficulty adjustments has two outcomes.

* The Bitcoin price increases after the difficulty is set for a two week period, Bitcoin will be comparatively more profitable to mine compared to Bitcoin Cash than the price would suggest.

Now, is it because he got this work done for him? Because he knew himself? Idk.

Also, I **didn't** read his recent article on selfish mining, but it so happens that I'm *very* unconvinced by it in its most fundamental points, and I think the article even went too further with an unbacked wild claim that bitcoin is flawed as a mechanism of incentives and cannot guarantee decventralization.

"From what I understand, the Lightening network is designed to handle day to day minor transactions, with the prime example being buying a cup of coffee. Large transactions do not benefit much from LN, there is much greater incentive to use the blockchain for those. 

Think of how SIP packets “piggyback” on top of TCP packets when you’re making a video call or watching a video stream. As the SIP packet delivers your video, it’s no big deal if a frame or two is dropped or arrives out of order, because the underlying protocol, TCP, resolves these errors.  This makes SIP very lightweight and efficient, because it doesn’t need to worry about error correction or error detection. 

The same concept is applied to the Lightning network, as it can only be run as a 2nd layer on top of Bitcoin. The idea is that centralization on the LN will be mitigated since the underlying technology that powers it, the blockchain, is inherently decentralized. ",1522819707

It's important to note, however, that we used to assume that for someone to attack bitcoin they would need more than 50% of the hashrate. The selfish mining paper shows that someone could attack Bitcoin with 33% of the hashrate and seriously disrupt the network. The smaller the hashrate required to successfully attack the network, the more vulnerable Bitcoin is to an attack from, say, a government who has run out of other options for stopping Bitcoin but still has a lot of fiat to throw around.",1522818974
"You actually understand the situation pretty well.

Bitcoin can't hardfork because they're retarded. The original Bitcoin was designed to work more like Monero and schedule these upgrades, but the Bitcoin community just has a bad habit over fighting every last thing.

"I want to clear up a misunderstanding.

I made the general case that a word can be used as a term of endearment internally without it being advocated as a general descriptor, and why it is not possible to adopt a term that others use as ones own.

This was in response to your question about why it is not possible to adopt Bcash as a term of endearment and have others use it as well.

It is not entirely obvious why adopting words others use to describe you is not an option, so I used historical examples to illustrate the general principle without making any analogy that a technology is the same as a race or sexuality. It is good that you remind me to clarify, and I agree with you that using Bcash tongue-and-cheek would be great for this forum to signal good will and a sense of not taking the project or our self to seriously. If we are not enjoying our self there is no point in engaging.

Fighting for names might seem trivial or unworthy, but it is what every organizations, individuals, political and social groups do no matter what the underlying realities are because language has an effect on how we think and make decisions.

An tech example is google pressuring dictionaries to remove ""googling"" as a general descriptor of web searches and only refer to it as using the google services.

I originally wished that Bitcoin Cash would be renamed and stand on the merits of the underlying technology as you say, taking the name seemed like piggybacking. I was under the impression that Bitcoin Cash was aiming to be something different than Bitcoin, until I understood the reasons Bitcoin Cash saw itself as Bitcoin.

I will however say that I am not pleased with Bitcoin.com being the site for Bitcoin Cash. I do not think that it is fair or reasonable to call Bitcoin anything but Bitcoin, and it is not correct or polite to call Bitcoin Cash for Bitcoin either. If those who argue for Bitcoin Cash wants to be able to decide their own name, then they are obligate to let others chose their name.

But all this is just my ramblings and changeable views.

I always assume that the person I am talking with is sincere and arguing in good faith, and I hope that I have not come of as hostile or dismissive towards you.",1522818749

There was an extremely short window of time for common folk to drop $25k+ on something that had very little public information released on it.  It just screams shady practices to me.  Doesn't it seem odd to you that there are currently 1700 GMN and only 300 MN?

I love the idea of the project, as I have an unhealthy interest in RFID/NFC technologies, but I truly hate how this was handled.  It's not benefiting the common early investor at all.

"&gt; fully validating nodes create a block with the top transactions

Here is your problem. They cannot be guaranteed to always agree. In fact, if they did, we wouldn't need a blockchain at all.

Because the speed of light is finite, it is impossible to guarantee that every node sees all transactions in the same order. Imagine you broadcast two conflicting transactions (double spends of each other, they spend the same money twice), simultaneously, one from a server in Australia, one from a server in Canada. Nodes near Canada will see one transaction first, while those near Australia will see the other one first. There is **no** objective criterion that is independently verifiable which will let you pick one over the other as more legitimate. The fact that they are connected through a randomly wired network, where each and every one of them may intentionally or accidentally delay propagation, makes this even worse.

In practice, every solution to this problem is somehow choosing a leader which picks the order in which transaction are processed. In Bitcoin, that choice is random, and proportional to hashing power. Competing to participate in this process is called mining, and one of the innovative things Bitcoin did was tie successful participation with distribution of the currency and fees - incentivizing cooperation financially.",1522816953

"IRS doesn't have much sway over non-US entities.

Have a look at [how the US has unsuccessfully tried to fight online gambling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_gambling#United_States). There are a lot of parallels with crypto there, e.g. ad networks banning online gambling ads.

If the US decides to make a serious effort, they will not be targeting Binance. They will try to prevent funds from US institutions from being sent to Binance (which can't really be done with crypto), or make US-based exchanges reject/report/audit incoming transfers from Binance. Maybe they could ask/threaten Binance to co-operate willingly with the threat of putting those measures in place. Binance is not the only big player though, and they're not going to do that for every major overseas exchange.

People love to go on about hiding their crypto gains with Monero, or claiming they lost it on BitConnect, etc. They're forgetting that in the end, they're going to want to receive cash/goods/services from their gains. That's when the IRS will step in.

The US-based exchanges that will let you cash out crypto into fiat USD, e.g. Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini, are all subject to KYC/AML regulation. When you send in and cash out a large amount of crypto and try to cash out, that's when the AML part kicks in. They will usually freeze the withdrawal, report it to the authorities, and wait for a green light from them before proceeding. This is when the IRS will learn about how much crypto you've made and compare it to what you reported. Same with large goods purchases, even if they're made with crypto. They'll generally only bother with the big fish, but it's still a risk.

As long as Binance doesn't give you fiat USD, they will not be subject to any kind of KYC/AML or similar enforcement. If you just want to keep your gains on Binance forever, then you can lie to the IRS without losing sleep. But if you wanna buy that lambo, your tax records better reflect that you can afford it.

tl;dr: IRS deals with things that are within their jurisdiction (e.g. USD fiat on-ramps, you, your bank, your local lambo dealer), not the things outside it (e.g. Binance).",1522815078

"SM is not in the same category of 50%+1 attacks. The latter is guaranteed to succeed, it is a whole different thing. SM is in the category of a Finney attack *in the sense that* it is a probabilistic attack risking to lose revenue to attempt the attack; assuming attackers have only minority hash power:

1) in the finney attack the attacker most probably end up with a lot of undesired goods while trying to mine his double spend, if he wants realistic chances of success and positive income;

2) in the SM strategy the attacker most likely end up with more orphans than accepted blocks, since it publishes blocks reactively and the sybil attack doesn't work;

The SM assumes that since the SM do former a longer chain sometimes, this can create a snowball effect to the extent that rational miners will join the pool. So the loss of revenue in 2) does not matter as long as they can get 50%+1 and hijack the consensus and centralize bitcoin. 

That's the whole point of the paper, but it is an unrealistic scenario in many ways:

a - the paper assumes this will happen but does not address any way the rest of the network could be *certain* of the edge the SM are having; and if they could be certain, they would most likely run the same strategy, thus dragging down the SM edge;

b - the edge needs to be sustained for several blocks to be visible, if there is a way to be visible other than simply accessing the rate of blocks being mined  (which would make the choice of pools pretty much a choice of going to bigger hash power pools and not the SM protocol awareness); this makes SM snow ball effect statistically negligible;

c - as said in point a, any other pool running the same strategy would thwart the SM edge; in fact, any pool mining a block way before 10 min has a positive incentive to just withhold the block for tens of seconds or more before propagation, to start mining the next one.

Thus, what happens when everybody is trying to withhold blocks is that no one has a permanent edge, they mine sequences of blocks until they fail and other pool mines sequences of blocks doing the same, or not.

The probability p of mining blocks in 0&lt;t&lt;10 minutes, say, t=5 min, will be a function of the hash rate only, thus having the same distribution as in the case t=10.",1522814379

A thought experiment (German: Gedankenexperiment, Gedanken-Experiment or Gedankenerfahrung) considers some hypothesis, theory, or principle for the purpose of thinking through its consequences. Given the structure of the experiment, it may not be possible to perform it, and even if it could be performed, there need not be an intention to perform it.

The common goal of a thought experiment is to explore the potential consequences of the principle in question:



""A thought experiment is a device with which one performs an intentional, structured process of intellectual deliberation in order to speculate, within a specifiable problem domain, about potential consequents (or antecedents) for a designated antecedent (or consequent)"" (Yeates, 2004, p. 150).

"The biggest problem I believe, and most people know this, for LATE 2017 and 2018 buyers was the dream of turning $100, $1,000 or more into tens or hundreds of thousands within months. Although there are those who bought into crypto in Oct and hopefully sold some in Dec for a crazy return this is not what people should be expecting. I feel like a much more reasonable expectation (as long as you didn't buy at ATH) is a couple of years. Who knows maybe a lot of coins will be back at or near ATH by the end of 2018 but even though I believe it will happen I don't think it will be until some time 2019 at the earliest. So if you can afford to hold until 2019+ I'd say dec-feb people will be fine. This type of movement builds strength. Most people wouldn't hope for more than 10% or 20% yearly growth on a ""normal"" investment. ",1522813006

&gt; In fact, a large number of the existing miner community will just black list you if you tried this… So, you start this attack, you start causing the honest miners to orphan blocks, and they will just sit and lose money. This is the crux of this trickery.

&gt; It is the idea that all miners are stupid other than the dishonest ones. Painting miners as evil has become a hobby as painting any capitalist as evil is the corresponding norm.

&gt; The selfish miner strategy leads to a loss of up to 33% or more of direct revenue. Profit is only a fine margin for most miners, so this is a huge loss. 
The entire argument is that miners will make incredible losses to show a small increase in perceived hash rate.

The selfish miner will discover P+1 before the honest miners discover X+1 with a probability equal to his share of the network hash rate. He loses more often than he wins, but his loss is only one block while his reward for winning is two. For the selfish miner in control of one-third of the network hash rate, this is a neutral strategy.

&gt; &gt;The advantage measured by γ is in addition to the selfish miner's unilateral capacity to execute the strategy.

&gt;How? Disregarding the fact you ignored the articles mentioning the fact bitcoin is a near complete graph, let's assume it is a mesh and can be sybiled.

I didn't ignore anything. The sentence you quote is responding to the article's claim that the network is a complete graph. Heck, the whole point of my comment was that it doesn't preclude the selfish miner strategy if the network can't be sybiled. In that event, γ=0 and the selfish miner doesn't get the _additional_ mining advantage. They still have whatever share of the network's hash rate they directly control.

"In the fall of 2013, Ittay Eyal and Emin Gün Sirer published a landmark paper titled ""Majority is Not Enough: Bitcoin Mining is Vulnerable."" In this paper, they showed that by strategically withholding and releasing blocks according to what they named the ""Selfish Mine"" algorithm, a deviant miner could earn more than his fair share of block rewards.

It was well understood since the Satoshi white paper that a miner with at least 51% of the network hash power could earn 100% of the revenue (by performing the so-called 51% attack). However, at the time of Eyal and Sirer's publication, it was generally assumed that a miner who controlled less than half of the hash power would be incentivized to ""play by the rules"" because it was thought that all deviant strategies would result in a loss of block rewards to the deviant miner.

What was important about Eyal and Sirer's work was that it showed this assumption to be false: indeed, a deviant strategy did exist that a miner with less than half of the network hash power could apply and be rewarded with increased revenue.

What the author of the linked article is missing is that the important result (that a deviant strategy also exists for miners with _less_ than 50% of the hash power) does not rely on the value of gamma.  Even if the selfish miner loses all block races, he still earns more than his fair share of the block rewards (once difficulty has readjusted) if he controls at least 1/3rd of the network hash power.  

Whether the selfish mining attack is a practical attack is debatable.  For example, in order for the strategy to turn a profit, the selfish miner must maintain the attack for several weeks to allow network difficulty to reset and hope that during that time other miners don't retaliate by adopting similar strategies.  But what is absolutely factual is that the 51% attack is not the only deviant strategy that results in the attacker earning more than his fair share of block rewards: the selfish-mining attack works also for some minority hash rates.

Oh look, my prediction came true! It must feel bad to be so comically predictable that I can tell you, directly, what you're about to do *and still be proven right as you do it anyway*.

In truly pathetic fashion, whenever anyone here is confronted with a detailed comment explaining facts that they don't want to pay attention to, they *always* do what you just did: call ""bullshit"" mindlessly (usually accompanied by an ad hominem, though to your credit you were civil enough to skip this part) and then *maybe* zero in on the one or two claims that they deem to be the ""lowest hanging fruit"" so that they can feel like they offered an actual counterargument. Presumably this allows them to convince themselves that this means that the exchange represents the clash of two equally-valid perspectives, rather than the truth, which is that one side just methodically deconstructed and eviscerated the other, while the other was barely capable of even *responding to* a **single** component of the first.

If I present you with ten facts, replete with proof of each fact in the list, and you pick a single fact out of the list and say ""Well for *this* fact, there's another thing worth considering..."" you didn't just ""hold your own"" or anything like that, and what you implicitly just revealed (whether you admit it or not) is that the other 9 facts have stumped you. More likely than not, you're trying to distract from them entirely by fixating on the one point you *do* respond to.

This is another reason why no one takes this place seriously.

&gt;Based on context, that Jihan Wu quote was apparently crafted for his specific audience

In other words, your argument is ""Don't worry, Jihan Wu was making dishonest and misleading public statements to further his own secret agenda!""

It seems that you haven't yet had the insight that *if you admit Jihan Wu does this sort of thing* (which it's pretty obvious that he *does*, regularly), then that means all his statements about *anything*, like BCH, Segwit, and ASICBoost, are now suspect, and we shouldn't put any significant stock into *what he actually says* when another (more direct and incentive-driven) motive explains his behavior on the matter much better. As soon as you do this, the anti-Segwit narrative suddenly shifts into focus... unless you're actively suppressing your own revelations on the matter.

I mean, statistical and extraNonce-based analysis indicates that covert ASICBoost has most likely been used by Bitmain on mainnet since February 2016. The fact that significant amounts of capital and effort were expended towards the legal scaffolding around and the chip design (not to mention fabrication!) of *massive* quantities of ASICBoost-capable hardware, which has a direct (positive) effect on the bottom line, should be enough. The fact that the person in charge of the operation will *proudly and enthusiastically* engage in selfish, harmful-to-users behavior because [""This is the freedom given by the Bitcoin protocol""](https://twitter.com/jihanwu/status/704476839566135298?lang=en) just hammers the point home. Segwit was an unambiguous upgrade to Bitcoin (and opt-in, too) with almost unanimous community support, and the ""dissent"" was a manufactured narrative motivated by the preservation of profits (at users' expense) that are yielded from a covert mining exploit which, unmitigated, happens to pervert the incentives which make Bitcoin into the antifragile network that it is.

&gt;The recent price divergence from BTC comes in the wake of increased merchant adoption. Said merchants may be applying selling pressure in order to pay their suppliers in FIAT.

Nope, that's not it. Check out the (absolutely pitiful) transaction volume of BCH. This isn't (primarily) merchant selling pressure (because apparently almost *no* payments are even being made to merchants in the first place); this is classic ""pump and dump"" asset behavior. Go load up some random dying shitcoin's charts on CoinMarketCap, and look at the chart of its price denominated in BTC; the pattern it follows will (in almost all cases) look *exactly* like the one BCH is following: a series of successive peaks on a steadily-downtrending baseline. Furthermore, the downtrend has been evident since the Coinbase-surprise-listing peak, which was before most of your ""merchant adoption"" was even added; your theory holds no water, and is an obvious attempt to shut your eyes and block out the truth of the matter.

I'm sorry, but you backed the wrong horse.


&gt;Bitcoin proper (I guess I would define that as largest POW chain)

You can define it that way if you want. Or you can define it via technical, consensus-based reasoning. Or you can define it by ""network size"" or ""asset value"" or any way you want... they all point to the same thing. Again, you backed the wrong horse. BTC is Bitcoin.

&gt; is not doing itself any favours by refusing to scale.

Who is refusing to scale? Bitcoin quadrupled the maximum blocksize last year, and the push towards responsible practices like transaction-batching have increased the efficiency considerably since then. Signature aggregation work is underway, and low-level optimizations are being made in the background regularly. Meanwhile, layer-two solutions allowing effectively *infinite* capacity (without sacrificing decentralization-potential and the means for self-validation in the process) are rolling out beta-stage implementations on mainnet, and being steadily adopted and refined every day. Bitcoin is scaling beautifully.

&gt;I agree that Bitcoin-segwit should have gotten it's own ticker symbol.

If it existed, surely it *would* get its own ticker symbol. But it doesn't.

There's a [B2X](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/segwit2x/), though, trading for about $1 right now. Perhaps that's what you are referring to (or *should* be referring to).

In any case, as we can both see, you aren't able to address the vast majority of what I'm saying, and even on the one or two minor points where you try, you just dig yourself deeper into a hole of shame.

"&gt;If γ&gt;0, there is opportunity that some honest miners see P before X and add their hash power to the selfish miner's capacity in the race to find P+1 before X+1.

The only way P (Dishonest miner) could beat X (Honest miner) is by an advantage in hashrate - however you are arguing that, as per the selfish mining paper that γ&gt;0 would give an disadvantage to the honest miner (P) via ""noise"". 

Alright, I'll bite.

&gt;The advantage measured by γ is in addition to the selfish miner's unilateral capacity to execute the strategy.

How? Disregarding the fact you ignored the articles mentioning the fact bitcoin is a near complete graph, let's assume it is a mesh and *can* be sybiled.

Why hasn't it been sybiled already? Why don't you provide EVIDENCE and do the following to prove the vulnerability:

&gt;1) Create a test blockchain

&gt;2) Have 2 parties mine, one with 66% hash rate (honest miners) and the other with 33% hash rate (Dishonest miners)

&gt;3) Have the dishonest miners spin up 1000, 10000+, whatever amount, 0-hashpower nodes and attempt to gain an advantage as per the selfish mining paper by proving it will make γ&gt;0.

&gt;4) Prove the negative reprocussions (What is the consequence actually put forward by this 'exploit'? the 33% ends up with the longest chain?)

If this vulnerability is real, you could make a KILLING by recreating the vulnerability and shorting bitcoin after you release the findings.

But we both know that isn't going to happen.

Whether you have 33% of the hashpower + 85% dishonest non-mining nodes or 33% of the hashpower + 0% dishonest non-mining nodes - you still have to compete with ***PoW***.

All of this is just mental gymnastics and ignoring actual economics (Dishonest miner burning money or the profit motive for honest miners to spin up 100,000 non-mining nodes and attack in reverse, for example)",1522808112

"His joke is based on the premise that when a signed
Byte (8 bits, 7 representing the number, 1 to indicate positive or negative, example: 10011010 is -102) is given a number larger than 127, the number value overflows into the bit that represents the sign. Craig is stating the number is less than 0%, hence negative, and vitalik mocks this by saying his bullshit detector is also negative, but then says he realized that was caused by the integer overflow, which means the number would have been too large to represent with the signed byte. This not only mocks Craig in how it implies the BTC network is culluding with a large amount of miners, but it also indicates the vitaliks bullshit detector is off the charts in how high it is, essentially saying his post is pure bullshit.

I would much rather trade my labor for deflationary assets rather than inflationary, war-backed fiat garbage any day, I have already lived through hyper-inflation once, it ain't fun, I would never choose to keep my savings in Fiat.

Even if it went to 0 I would survive, and could choose to go back to being paid in fiat if that happened. Don't do it if you have kids and a family and/or have a low risk tolerance. If you told me do you want to get paid 50% in gold and silver of your paycheck, I would happily take that as well (Especially since I would not pay tax on it, as I would choose to get paid in $50 gold coins, which are legal currency, even though it is worth $1300+ in gold value, the legal value of the coin is $50, so I can make the case that I only pay tax on the face amount as it is legal tender.) So I would rather get paid in gold that crypto but bottom line is, yes I would happily get paid in assets with finite supply rather than infinite supply; regardless of short-term gains/losses.

"&gt; wow, no idea where that comment on human nature is coming from :D

No surprises there, it's just more proof you are out of your depth.

The scaling debate, like every other debate in human history, had different sides to it and the community split. Whenever there are different views, the community splits. You think this is something that happened in Bitcoin only? ETH vs ETC? You already see this happening in BCH, even! OP_GROUP, yes or no?? Sure, this may not lead to a split now, but over time, and especially if BCH grows as you hope, I am willing to take bets that it will happen again. Every ~4yrs this same thing is put to the test in most countries on Earth, it's called an election. 

This is human nature. And that's why Andreas said what he did, he gets it. As soon as another coin gets to the same level of engagement and involvement as Bitcoin, the community will split over whatever solution will be disputed. The only way to avoid this is, ironically, through a leader.  If there's an ultimate leader, the split may be averted. But I don't think that's what any coin calling itself decentralzed wants.

As for those altcoins with tons of txs, just shows you don't really understand the topic properly. ETH has a txs limit of ~15txs/s. That's not scale, that's kicking the can down the road. Not to mention the blockchain or state bloat on ETH... as of today there are cases where you simply cannot sync a full node because of the bloat. Google it, it'll be illuminating. So yes, ETH has more txs than BTC, does not have scale, AND there are cases where you cannot sync a full node. 

As for STEEM and BTS, I don't know the underlying tech very well, but I suspect it's not a blockchain. Regardless of whatever anyone altcoin shill tells you, no blockchain can scale. (Let's ignore the big block vs small block debate here.) So if those coins are not based on blockchains, perhaps they have it easier. Perhaps... let's not forget that Bitcoin is battle hardened, but most coins are not. If your favourite coin was never attacked, it does not mean it's safe. Or, to quote Andreas, don't mistake smooth sailing for good sailors. And if they have a centrally dictated dev team, it's not decentralized. Which means they can/will be coerced by governments to do as they please. Thanks, but no thanks.

"&gt; So long as people know that any increase in demand will increase the price of bitcoin, then there will be speculators looking to take advantage of any increase in demand.

I said as much

&gt; There is nothing stopping the demand from speculators being several times greater than the demand from currency users which is a bad thing for the stability of a currency because such speculative behavior is inherently cyclical. 

Agree with everything except that it's a bad thing. Cyclical does not mean infinite. Smart/lucky speculators will make a profit; dumb/unlucky ones will get burnt and eventually learn not to speculate.

&gt; This is why no widely used currency in human history has ever been fixed supply. Fixed supply guarantees that any level of use will lead to rampant speculation

"As long as there are different companies developing and producing ASICs, then there is no problem.

Using GPUs lets every mining company get equal access to hardware, but at the cost of making GPUs more expensive for everyone who uses them as intended.

Hash rate majority can happen naturally in the form of pools, even if the mining hardware is distributed and no pool is trying to get the majority.

If some rich entity wanted to get the majority of Etherium hashrate, they could pay a 20% bonus reward in their mining pool, or bribe an existing pool to, and gradually get the majority of the hash, the maximum daily cost they would pay to get 51% of the hashpower sustained hash would be 10% of the daily reward, 800k usd daily with current prices.

Same principle works with Bitcoin, it is just more expensive. It is also possible to bribe or pressure miners directly.

If anything Bitcoin has grown in spite of those things and with downward pressure from those entities. Bitcoin isn't a trendy new app, or a new flavor of Coke it's a bottom up grassroots movement that shakes the foundation of the existing powers of banks and government. It couldn't grow at anything but a slow pace.

If Bitcoin could've paid its way into grocery stores, retail outlets, big box chains, and given away millions of dollars in free money plus had a flashy app to make it all easy it would have the market share of those other services. There just isn't anyone throwing that money around in the name of bitcoin. The only money you'll find getting invested is to try and take advantage of all the opportunities that it's future could hold. 

Even things like Apple or Android Pay took time to be adopted and haven't fully been adopted. While Bitcoin is still primarily a blackmarket currency it is still one of the best ways to make international money transfers. Of course, now banks are trying to push alternatives that are currently free to use so they don't lose that business and can hopefully charge for it later. There are plenty of place that accept bitcoin as payment but you have to make an effort to find them.

It is very volatile. It makes it great for trading and it has a lot of potential so it's probably a good long term investment. So far it has been incredibly secure which is pretty astonishing.

"&gt;Batching is good, but doesn't help me if I have 1000 satoshis on a single address.

The original claim was that ""you can't move 1000 satoshis on Bitcoin, it's impossible, fees would exceed it anyway""... this was incorrect. The new claim (that isolated dust outputs aren't very spendable right now) is much more defensible, but also much less of a serious issue. And for the record, the minrelayfee exists in BCH, too (and is the same value, in fact) so the exact same problem exists with knockoff Bitcoin-airdrop altcoins (the only difference being that their ""satoshis"" are worth less than one tenth of ours, and this figure is pretty steadily dwindling).

&gt;Wanted to try it out, I was looking for wallets on Bitcoin.org, and couldn't find any which supported Lightning Network. Am I missing something?

The Lightning Network is a layer above the base (blockchain) layer and is relatively young right now, so it will probably be a while before bitcoin.org starts listing Lightning wallets/software.

If you are looking for a wallet with ""official"" mainnet support and a user-friendly GUI, Eclair might be the only one right now (which is a phone app). Zap has a slick interface but I don't think they have officially released a mainnet release yet. Lightning Labs' lnd has full mainnet support but requires command-line interaction at the moment.

The TL;DR is that you should be Googling ""Lightning Network wallet"" rather than starting from a general Bitcoin portal.",1522805156

"&gt; What I eventually concluded, is that if a coin's market price drops below a certain point, it would no longer be sustainable for miners, and that would lead to heavy centralization and hashrate attacks.

So why did bitcoin succeed when it was worth pennies?

&gt;My doubt is that it's implementation in the field will be overly complicated, thus hard to setup and prone to errors. Then again, I might be wrong about these concerns.

If you studied the technical side of bitcoin you would understand its like the internet in the early 90's. The foundation was laid, but scaling was a issue.

So how did we scale it?

With layer 2 networks.

These complications you see are the same complications with *literally every single piece of technology ever*. 

You are being very short sighted by not learning the same mistake that has been repeated since the dawn of civilization. Horse and Buggy carriages said that the car would never catch on. Radio executives had the chance to buy into telephone technology but refused, stating it was ""too complicated"". 

Or even better, how about Paul Krugman?

&gt;By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet’s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine’s.

The story is the same story every single time. People with no forward thinking vision who are stuck in tiny little boxes of their own making being completely non comprehending of how technology works, advances, or scales.

Im telling you as straight and direct as I can ....do you want to be on the right side of history? Or do you want to be a dinosaur?

You can keep advocating for horse and buggies, radio, fax machines and the like, or you can recognize that literally the most experienced and brilliant engineers are designing the Lightning Network.

Do you really not know who the people are working on the project? People like Rusty Russell, who literally wrote iptables and ipchain (network protocols) for linux, the operating system that powers the internet?

People like Nick Szabo, who is the most likely person to be satoshi, strongly advocates for 2nd layer scaling networks. 

Im not sure why you would ignore every expert on the topic, but there has been consensus for years that this is the most intelligent way to scale the system.

Reputations and experience *actually do matter* and its not an appeal to authority to say that you want a experienced plumber to fix your plumbing instead of jose, who you just picked up near the home depot.

"The network might possibly have some value down the road - who knows - it isn't actually used for anything right now. 

Down the road, all sorts of other things will also come online - some we can predict, some we can't. Absolutely no one can say with any certainty that bitcoin will thrive, survive or die in that environment.  

The reason I think bitcoin will not succeed as a currency (it may well limp on for years as novelty nerd bucks for a while) or as a store of value is because a.  It's way too volatile to be a store of value, and b. it's far inferior to greenbacks as currency and actually just gets in the way of transactions.   

Eventually the feds will produce a digitized greenback or someone will figure out a way to put dollars in a blockchain and eliminate the unnecessary bitcoin which is only serving as a middleman. 

And I know the libertarians will go. . .but but but but inflation.  

That's stupid AF (for at least a couple of reason) and it displays their complete lack of understanding about money and economies.  First, no one (as a rule) stores their wealth in cash under a mattress.  Interest bearing accounts, money market funds, bonds, stocks, annuities and all sorts of other cash flow producing instruments completely offsets the worry about inflation.  So that's a stupid argument.  Second, deflationary currency is a stupid AF concept to begin with.

"Apparently you are no longer interested in discussing. Or maybe left the computer for other reasons. No problems, I'll point out the issue for others.

So, we know with 100% hash power, the average time to find a block is 10 minutes.

Therefore, if we pick a random point on the blockchain timeline, the expected (average) time to the next block is 10 minutes. This also means the expected (average) time to the previous block is 10 minutes. Together, this means the average time between blocks is 20 minutes.

However on the Bitcoin blockchain, we know that the average time between blocks is 10 minutes, not 20. Bitcoin is not conditionless. Average times between blocks are 10 minutes. If Bitcoin were conditionless, then the 20 minute average between blocks would be true, and the whole SM argument would hold water. But, SM finding a block does not change what the HM is doing. HM will still find blocks on its relative average, regardless of what SM is finding or not finding.

"[Here you are ""calling out"" Jimmy Song](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/87j0bc/a_detailed_slideshow_by_roger_on_how_the/dwdd30v/):

"This probably explains M[AST simplest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree).

M = Merkle. AST = abstract syntax trees

AST is another way of saying ""Mad Libs"" if you were familiar with those as a kid.

But where as Contracts on Ethereum each require their own set of codes, processing, and storing - A MAST Contract would read such as:

Input A -&gt; Perform Action 235 (look up 235, output multi-sig) -&gt; Request Inputs B -&gt; Validate Action 124 (look up 124, use HASH 256...) so on...

In other words smart contracts would be written in parts, referencing parts of previously submitted smart contracts. This would reduce a contract size from say 2,500 Bytes to say 700 Bytes.

What is likely more important however, as it couples with 'sharding' type of technology, then the contracts could get pruned down. Ethereum is a son of a bitch to host a full node upon. It's near impossible, kills SSDs in months. Some contract read / write, a lot. Unlike BTC, where each transaction is coin movement, an ETH transaction can be a web browser updating - This is all great when transactions are a penny, but paying more than a penny for web browsing is sort of crazy. Also, someone might 'inadvertently' spam 'refresh page', multiple this by 1,000 Users acting in unison, and you end up with ass tons of reading and rewriting on the SSDs, happening all the fucking time.

Smart Contracts just don't work in the current form, unless you do like what NEO did, which is charge people $2,500 per smart contract (or some such) where as they are (virtually) free on ETH.

To get smart contracts to work, in the way people expect them to, and to keep node hosting 'decentralized' - most smart contract functionality will need to be pruned from the main block chain, and kept within a silo, side chain, or shard.

This is a concept we've been working on with [Alvalor](/r/Alvalor). Which is something of a sandbox project, with focus on Stack development, but also about pushing boundaries.

Many of the other projects that have developed around and on top of Bitcoin are similarly open. Yet Craig and nChain are filing hundreds upon hundreds of patents for IP that they have no intention of even trying to implement. And somehow, some people are cheering them on for that. There are very few rational explanations for that.",1522797295

"Around the time of the BCH fork, Andreas came out pretty strongly on the side of Core / Blockstream. This betrayed a lot of what he'd always been saying, since he refused to call out the faction he was backing for all the censorship and other unethical behavior they tolerated (or even supported). He then proceeded to slink off from Reddit and ban any Twitter users that dared to even question him with legitimate counterarguments in order to duck critcism, personally adopting the same behavior of /u/theymos. He repeatedly characterized the /r/BTC community as ""toxic"" though it's obvious to any objective outsider that /r/Bitcoin is no better (or, indeed, far worse). Moreover, it seems that all the time he's been publicly speaking for Bitcoin, he himself has not been much of an adopter or a ""HODLer"".

Since then, it seems he's vacillated a bit away from the BTC side as it's become more and more obvious that the small-block side is not the clearly winning side, but even if he publicly comes out with a full mea culpa he has a long road ahead of him to recuperate his tarnished image.

Also I'd like to mention that making Bitcoin a *legal currency* would not mean that people *have* to use it as a currency. If Bitcoin is made a legal currency, **all that would change is the format of the taxes applied to its trade and use**, nothing more. Bitcoin can still be used as a currency even if it isn't declared as one by the governments of the world, just like gold or cowry shells could be used as money without permission from the government.

Propaganda can change opinions about the future, but it has a pretty hard time ignoring the realities of the present.  

BTC's price is probably vastly overhyped -- considering if there is significant adoption and use, fees make it rather unusable.   Lighting network might help - but it will still require the use of BTC, so it won't solve the problem.  It more likely will make it possible to once again use BTC for things you have to use BCH or LTC for now.

"It's possible that all of those people worked together and were SN. However, even if that was true, that means CSW lied when he said that he was Satoshi and knowingly omitted his partners. We can be pretty certain that he lied about being Satoshi in any case because he failed to meet the bar of signing a message with known SN private keys. That is really the only acceptable proof that someone ""is"" SN. CSW attempted to bluff that he was able to provide that proof and take credit for being SN for himself. Those are not the actions of someone who should be trusted.

Additionally, if you look at the work and research CSW had done since ""coming out"", it's frequently meaningless technobabble, at best.

"**Construal level theory**

Construal level theory (CLT) is a theory in social psychology that describes the relation between psychological distance and the extent to which people's thinking (e.g., about objects and events) is abstract or concrete. The general idea is that the more distant an object is from the individual, the more abstract it will be thought of, while the closer the object is, the more concretely it will be thought of. In CLT, psychological distance is defined on several dimensions—temporal, spatial, social and hypothetical distance being considered most important, though there is some debate among social psychologists about further dimensions like informational, experiential or affective distance.

An example of construal level effects would be that although planning one's next summer vacation one year in advance (in the distant future) will cause one to focus on broad, decontextualized features of the situation (e.g., anticipating fun and relaxation), the very same vacation planned to occur very soon will cause one to focus on specific features of the present situation (e.g.

**Greenwashing**

Greenwashing (a compound word modelled on ""whitewash""), also called ""green sheen"", is a form of spin in which green PR or green marketing is deceptively used to promote the perception that an organization's products, aims or policies are environmentally friendly. Evidence that an organization is greenwashing often comes from pointing out the spending differences: when significantly more money or time has been spent advertising being ""green"" (that is, operating with consideration for the environment), than is actually spent on environmentally sound practices. Greenwashing efforts can range from changing the name or label of a product to evoke the natural environment on a product that contains harmful chemicals to multimillion-dollar advertising campaigns portraying highly polluting energy companies as eco-friendly. Publicized accusations of greenwashing have contributed to the term's increasing use.

Bitcoin Cash is Very Good,1522795775
"&gt; Ditch reward, and let groups dedicated to the cause contribute their time and resources for no gain except to maintain the network. Its the only way to reduce inefficiency.

There are already no rewards for running a node, and that is the most important part of the Bitcoin network. Mining is just a byproduct of the system they have chosen, its an inefficiency in the protocol and it is not a requirement, nor does it add any strength in terms of consensus or decentralization. If anything it's a point of weakness. Newer technology has already demonstrated decentralized consensus can be done quite easily without mining. Nodes however are still a requirement in all protocols, and will remain so in the future for obvious reasons.

The problem with rewarding nodes is that an efficient node is a cheap one and a fast one, so if you were to reward the nodes with the same coins you'd dilute the coin supply and devalue it. This could be overcome by having a second coin as the reward for running a node, but rewarding nodes is actually a hard problem in itself with lots of avenues for gaming. Once you introduce rewards, you need to harden security, and you'd almost need another layer on top of it to maintain node consensus at that point to ensure coins are distributed correctly and not through attack, and then that further introduces inefficiencies again (as you stated above). 

Still, I don't think it's all doom and gloom, people are pretty innovative and I think someone will come up with a clever solution for node rewards whilst maintaining a considerable amount of efficiency. It's an interesting problem though, for sure. Personally I think ""maintaining the network"" is actually enough to maintain a coin provided the nodes are cheap to run, because businesses have incentive to ensure their profits keep coming through, and they can generally process transactions more efficiently for themselves by running their own nodes, so it's not an entirely self-sacrificing move anyway.",1522795772

"&gt; Just because someone is wrong doesn't make them a fraud

You are trying to create a false narrative by turning things upside down.

Being wrong can mean having made a mistake or accident. CSW didn't accidentally claim to be Satoshi. He claimed to be Satoshi intentionally and elaborately.

Being wrong can also mean being honestly factually incorrect. Somebody who isn't Satoshi isn't believing honestly that they are Satoshi, therefore they can't be ""wrong"" about that (because they're not actually believing it, unless they suffer a mental disorder).

No, ""wrong"" isn't what CSW is. What CSW did was lie and manipulate to attempt to impersonate somebody else for CSWs own gain (evidently). That makes CSW a fraud (if not legally, then at least morally).

This is how the vast majority of hash power has been empirically demonstrated to operate, see what happened November 12 last year to see what actually happens when the profitability equilibrium swings the other way.

It is speculation, by all means if you have actual evidence proving it correct, go ahead and provide it. Otherwise you sound like a clueless priest exhorting others to just have faith. You also don't appear to understand that simply having over 51 percent of the hash power is not a deathblow for a given blockchain.

"&gt; Bitcoin Cash is the continuation of the Bitcoin project as peer-to-peer electronic cash. It is a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain ledger, with upgraded consensus rules that allow it to grow and scale. That means you own the same amount of Bitcoin Cash as you did Bitcoin at the time of the fork. Bitcoin Cash immediately raises the blocksize limit to 8MB as part of a massive on-chain scaling approach. There will be ample capacity for everyone's transactions. Low fees and fast confirmations resumed with Bitcoin Cash. The network is growing fast again. Users, merchants, businesses, and investors are returning.


&gt;Why didn't Bitcoin raise the blocksize if it was easy? 


&gt; Some of the developers did not understand and agree with the original vision of peer-to-peer electronic cash that Satoshi Nakamoto had created. Instead, they preferred Bitcoin become a settlement layer. Many miners and users trusted these developers, while others recognized that they were leading the community down a different road than expected. These two very different visions for Bitcoin are largely incompatible, which led to the community divide. -from http://bitcoincash.org/#faq

"Yeah this makes sense. If btc does recover to ATH, I think that will provide some major support for the store of value argument. ",1522793151
"Well LN could well be a great example of 'adoption at all costs', but I'm talking about the overall sense of 'bitcoin is at the stage where adoption is critical'.  Adoption is the absolute critical piece of the puzzle right now for some people and some use cases, primarily people with a LOT of any currency and who want to be able to cash in or cash out leveraging that position.  For 'Bitcoin' as a whole, however, security, decentralization and multiple use cases are, and have always been, more critical pieces than immediate adoption.

One thing that makes adoption seem like the number one priority is timing...people seem to think that if adoption doesn't happen 'right now!', that we're going to miss the chance, but if that happens at the expense of some other component, it would be better to miss the chance.  If Roger Ver or anyone gets you psyched up and hopping up and down about how 'this is the chance, and if we let it slip through our hands we're going to regret it', remember that this is identical to the tactic used by every used car salesman and pyramid scheme con man in history...you can be in on the ground floor, or you can catch this car, which is way underpriced 'right now', but you know, there's another buyer I'm obligated to make this offer to, so if you don't buy it 'right now!' I can't promise it will be here tomorrow.

It's very possible that 'right now!' is the only time btc or bch or eth or blah blah blah can take off, and that waiting a month or a year will be fatal to the 'movement', but it's also possible that taking it slow and steady, not trying to push it when there isn't one of them that isn't laughably too early in place for mass adoption (give your grandma bitcoin in any form, paper, plastic, phone app, etc and see if she can figure out how to spend it without giving someone access to unrecoverably steal it) is the right way to go.

"I’m sick and tired of this “satoshi’s vision” crap. If satoshi had a vision set in stone, he should have copyrighted, patented, setup a board of directors, deputies, all to ensure his vision (whatever it was) would be carried out until the end of time. Or... instead of being anonymous, he could have revealed himself to the world to ensure his vision has a leader... until he’s ready to pass the baton to someone else.

Instead, we got open-source software, available to everyone, for anyone to do as they please. One man, no matter how brilliant his invention is, cannot have the foresight to then dictate how a vision should play out. The vision is no one’s and yet everyone’s. That’s what consensus is. 

So even if there was some satoshi vision..... it’s irrelevant. The bitcoin project he started has a life of its own, out in the wild, where after 10 years it has survived and thrived...and become what it is now. Even satoshi wasn’t sure this would work.... because it wasn’t his anymore.

The exact specifics of how the hash power is controlled, or who would need to be compromised or coerced in order to control a majority of it, I don't have access to, and neither does anyone else. There is speculation that some of the pools are controlled by bitmain to the extent that they're effectively just shells to  mask the fact that they have well over 51 percent, but it is just that, speculation. And because BCH and BTC share the exact same proof of work algorithm, any criticism that is levelled at one side of the scales is simultaneously levelled at the other. There's no such thing as a BTC miner that can't mine BCH, or vice versa. 

The whole proof of work question is inadequately defined. People just find a perspective that allows them to advance their personal agenda and parrot it out, and because the agenda that advantages BTC / blockstream revolves around ignoring all these inconvenient facts about the mining situation, and they're the ones that shout loudest and hire the most sock  puppets, they're the ones people tend to echo when they themselves don't actually understand it either.

"PoW coin is a chain/ecosystem made of developers, miners, and users. Did I miss someone? Each of these parties needs to have some kind of benefit from the system, and I agree with that. Resource management is important.

I've studied the technical side of Bitcoin, but didn't go much into the economics and sustainability. What I eventually concluded, is that if a coin's market price drops below a certain point, it would no longer be sustainable for miners, and that would lead to heavy centralization and hashrate attacks. That's my main issue with BCH right now. Likewise, my main issue with BTC is that if tx fees rise, the coin won't be appealing to end users as a medium of exchange, while the miners would be certainly incentivized with higher fees and would keep securing the hashrate. You're completely right in that regards, that every participant in the coin's ""game"" needs to have a positive outcome. If there's no incentive for everyone, the coin isn't sustainable long-term.

LN will enable sub-satoshi payments, I have no doubts it will, as it has no blockchain-related limitations, and I've seen videos showing LN clients in action. My doubt is that it's implementation in the field will be overly complicated, thus hard to setup and prone to errors. Then again, I might be wrong about these concerns.

Citation needed. Heresay isn't proof.

&gt; Yes, you can also get hit by a meteor every time you leave home. That doesn't mean you have to wear a titanium helmet everytime you go out for a walk. Miners are incentivised to be honest, so any attack is as likely as getting hit by a meteor.

Ah now suddenly 51% attacks are possible. We're now just squabbling about the likelyhood.

&gt; Yes it is turing complete

Turing complete means that a system can be used to simulate a turing machine. A turing machine expresses a program as an endless tape. In order to function the machine has to have the ability to jump to any position in the tape, and to read and write from that tape.

Bitcoin has a ""tape"", but it is very short, and there is no jumping to any position on the tape by the machine, it's advanced sequentially from front to back exactly once. Therefore it cannot be used in itself to simulate a turing machine. This shows that Bitcoin is not turing complete by itself. There's your ""proof"".

&gt; Of course they do, they need recruiting and convincing.

I say they don't.

This is neither his idea, nor is he the first to utter it, nor are most people who've been around for a while convinced by him of the validity of that idea.

Ethereum requires no 3rd party to do this. RSK aims to facilitate 100 tx/s, while Ethereum's second layer solution, Plasma, will allow initiatives like OmiseGo to facilitate 1,000,000 tx/s.

"&gt;Remember that everyday consumers would be insuring against their own problems, which insurance traders would correlate with root causes.
&gt;If we can't rely on people rationally buying insurance (...)

You're counting on people counciously buying en masse into a scheme that assumes some kind of unlawful vigilante-esque approach under the pretense of ""insurance"" even though it is nothing like insurance at all and it's more akin to hiring mercenaries to ""take care"" of some issue or someone. And instead of just doing it straight it operates under the pretense of eventuality, funny. There's no tiptoing around the issue. Let's drop the act and nice words like ""insurance"" and ""prediction markets"" and call things how they are. You are exploring the possibility for the decentralized mercenary market for specific goals. In this case we assume this particular prediction market will sort of order hit jobs for the greater good. The methods of achieving those goals would be completely at a discretion of parties that would eventually profit from the scheme should the prediction happen to be true.

In a climate that would allow such a thing I'm sure much less noble schemes would also sprout but that is beyond the scope of this exploration. I'm simply implying that to consider that society as whole would even think about using such a thing is ridiculous. Bitcoin may succeed or it may fail but such scheme is unrealistic imho and it borders some kind of morbid  dark sci-fi scenario.

I consider such a scenario to be remotely plausible only in a world in which state is gone. Otherwise your hired vigilantes who supposedly will outnumber the security forces of a targered factory will be gunned down by swat like common thugs after police is called. So let me ask you. Do you on top of this thing believe in the disappearance of state? Because that would make at least some sense, otherwise it's just wishful thinking powered by some very creative fantasy.

The solution for global pollution isn't some anonymous sabotage groups powered by the blockchain. That's what anarchist and naive activist groups resort to and that's why they are an irrelevant speck of history that will never amount to anything other than temporary nuisance for the companies they targeted.

The change is all about slow progress towards consensus about dangers to the environment on the higher echelons of power, pressure from society, good science and sound reasoning and real activism and time... It already begins. Big companies understand it is ""hip"" to be eco and are switching their data centers to renewable energy sources by themselves. They know it's good PR. Big polluting countries like China begin to understand that polluting their own citizens is overall uneconomical in the long run due to health issues and invest heavily in renewable energy. European Union strives heavily towards cleaner energy and I bet United States will in time also become more eco friendly, they have good conditions for those. Unfortunately we will always pollute the environment one way or another because our whole civilization relies on high tech solutions but this damage can be diminished with progress and better, eco friendly industrial solutions not some weird high-tech luddite vigilantism. That's short sighted and hardly effective in the grand scheme of things. A childish fantasy that could work in a comic book, not a real world.

To your first question, the &gt;1 sat/b tx did propagate, but only to nodes that didn't have the conflicting txn (which was most of them, including my Electron Cash wallet).  More info on how that happened in the first post - https://jasonc.me/blog/bitcoin-double-spend#exploit",1522789162
"No. BCH is about to quadruple because usage is up for both BTC and BCH. (and most crypto, from last week)

But BTC has had a hard time keeping the mempool empty for the last 8 or so hours. So, higher fees on BTC means more people get to see how good BCH is.

"You're right -- Molson Ice is drinkable. Poutine is delicious. And the Canadian Rockies are amazing. I actually love Canada.

I am invested in crypto projects but I view it strictly as a longshot investment and they represent a pretty minimal part of my portfolio. Even if you're skeptical about the long-term viability of the tech there is still money to be made in the short-term. Buying something like Ethereum at 360 a couple days ago is an obvious swing trade. I also do quite well buying up very low cap projects (that are either on a dex or a low volume exchange) and selling after a larger listing is looming.

I think pure currency plays are probably the worst long-term investment because I believe global adoption is highly unlikely especially for PoW coins. But I do hold some because I believe a black swan event could change this and that such events are still not accurately priced into markets (the Nicholas Taleb view). 

I'm also not entirely opposed to investing in platform tokens, because I think it's possible (if not likely) one of these projects could develop proprietary tech that is so compelling it might foster broader adoption. But I also think crypto is still ridiculously overvalued ATM -- it's all based on what ifs and might bes and partnerships that are far less meaningful that what most people believe. It's also transparently obvious these partnerships are being leveraged primarily to move markets.

Hyperledger, I believe, is going to be the blockchain path most corporates choose in the near term because it is as turnkey as this stuff gets. If you haven't looked into it, probably worth your time. 

I've worked with a lot of larger enterprise firms and they are exceedingly cautious; many have calcified managerial structures that resist innovation. Public chains are anathema. They also don't understand the tech in many cases and widely believe crypto is all hype and scams. And you don't need crypto or tokenization to have blockchain, of course. I think it's going to be vastly harder for platforms to facilitate corporate adoption than most people think -- and the unprofessional behavior of some of these projects is just one minor reason why.",1522789026

Yes, you can also get hit by a meteor every time you leave home. That doesn't mean you have to wear a titanium helmet everytime you go out for a walk. Miners are incentivised to be honest, so any attack is as likely as getting hit by a meteor.

Acknowledging that bitcoin is turing complete which opens new frontiers

&gt;Bitcoin isn't turing complete. If you argue something is turing complete because you've choosen to feed the output of a program back into that program, then everything is turing complete, even things that aren't. It's a nonesense argument made by people who can't program. Evidently CSW is one of these.

Yes it is turing complete, there is one proof by CSW and another by Cemens on this. If you say it is not Turing complete, or cannot be used as a TC machine then link me the paper disproving Clemens' proof.

&gt;&gt;Recruiting new miners such as Calvin Ayre and SBI group
&gt;Miners don't need recruiting. 

Of course they do, they need recruiting and convincing. Moreover, nChain brought SBI not only to mine but also to commit to helping make BCH digital cash. 

&gt;&gt;providing a clear target, digital cash, millions of transactions per second. While others try to reinvent the wheel and come up with a new store of value.
&gt;CSW did none of that. A lot of people did a lot for that, and a lot of people like me support that idea long before CSW ever got involved. Am I going to get credit too?

Yes he did in every talk he has been educating people on how bitcoin can scale onchain and on how to make 0 conf transactions safer. Not only him, but he is one of those people. Also core believes in bitcoin as cash, but through lightning. There is a difference between pushing for that idea through protocol changes and saying we are ready let's just scale.

&gt;&gt;Educating people on network topology. Mesh vs complete. Think this is irrelevant? Btc is convinced bitcoin can scale only through LN and have 2 stores total online. The fact that they consider it a mesh is part of the reasons they think it cannot scale.
&gt;I've been saying that LN can't work because of the limited edge capacity graph that will devolve into a centralized network pretty much the day they put out the whitepaper. I think that means I deserve more credit than CSW on that front.

"I'll start with your last point and I don't think you're going to like it. 

&gt;Keeping the blocks small so that everyone can run their own full node is also ""the right thing to do"". Sound familiar?

Of course it sounds familiar. I know the story and I'm on your side of this one. The problem is the ""small blockers"" were only presented with a single solution (side chains), due to censorship within a community that didn't even realize it was being censored. But side chains *were* a solution, just not the only one. The Bitcoin community **wasn't given a choice**. And thats the difference. 

The article lays out options that *could possibly* settle the CSW fiasco. But asking him to step down wasn't the only option given. 

If Blockstream said, ""hey we have some problems.. the current state of things isn't going to support long term adoption. We need to be able to scale and here are some options that could get us there.. Bigger Blocks, Side Chains, Segwit etc.."" Then the community would have the opportunity to weigh in on the options. **Not presenting all of the options as possibilities, but instead dictating the *only* solution was where the censorship happened.** 

&gt;Does he LOVE/BELIEVE in Bitcoin Cash to remove himself from Bitcoin Cash?

I think you're right here - I don't agree with this. CSW can do whatever the fudge crackers that he wants to in regards to BCH. 

&gt;Will he protect Bitcoin Cash or does his EGO mean more to him?

But his ego is huge. It would benefit the entire community if he *metaphorically* took a step back and assessed the things he claims and how he presents himself. Self evaluation is healthy. And a lack of it can be catastrophic.

&gt;Will nChain or Jimmy Nguyen do what is right for Bitcoin Cash?

This is a valid question, assuming you agree that CSW is doing harm to the BCH name. If you don't think that's the case, then ignore it. nChain isn't BCH just as much as CSW isn't BCH. nChain has a reputation to uphold and when the majority of the community that you're selling too thinks your head dude is a fraud, its time to self evaluate again. 

We can't control or assume to control CSW. It's not right. But we can fear harm to our community. We can know all the possible options and we can weigh in on those. Telling /u/toomuch72 that he can't give his opinions on *possible solutions* is censorship. We should be free to express any opinions we want.

"&gt; Step Away From his Leadership Role at nChain

&gt; This is a solution, but I personally think it is a bad one, whether over time I've grown to have a love/hate relationship with Dr. Wright, he is very prominent in the Twitter community and has always been open for debate. So I, personally, think he has much more to offer Bitcoin Cash.  Does he LOVE/BELIEVE in Bitcoin Cash to remove himself from Bitcoin Cash? Will he protect Bitcoin Cash or does his EGO mean more to him? Will nChain or Jimmy Nguyen do what is right for Bitcoin Cash?

First, it is offered as a solution. Maybe the author thinks it's a less-than-ideal solution, but it is still considered a solution. Attempts to censor people should never be considered a solution in the first place. But more than that, let me quote that again...

&gt; Does he LOVE/BELIEVE in Bitcoin Cash to remove himself from Bitcoin Cash? Will he protect Bitcoin Cash or does his EGO mean more to him? Will nChain or Jimmy Nguyen do what is right for Bitcoin Cash?

This is an attempt to appeal to his emotions that leaving Bitcoin Cash is ""the right thing to do"". It's an attempt to appeal to nChain and Jimmy that removing him is ""the right thing to do"".

This is advocating censoring him, under the guise of it being ""the right thing to do"".

Keeping the blocks small so that everyone can run their own full node is also ""the right thing to do"". Sound familiar?

"&gt;By now it is obvious CSW is professional con artist.

A con artist that happens to make a lot of important points about Bitcoin no one else is making? 

Vitalik's comment about ""negative gamma"" was a kneejerk reaction based purely on CSW's phrasing, preventing him from looking deeper and learning something. 

I haven't heard CSW's reasoning on this, but his point is obvious from even the two words ""negative gamma"" to anyone who understands the network topology and the financial incentives that drive it, and who takes a moment to visualize. The suggestion that γ (gamma) is ""negative"" is simple, correct, and relevant but worded in a weird way (as usual for CSW), as I'll show now.

Look at this section of the original selfish mining paper [emphasis mine]:

&gt;Because selfish mining is reactive, and it springs into action only after the honest nodes have discovered a block X, it may seem to be at a disadvantage. But a savvy pool operator can **perform a sybil attack on honest miners by adding a significant number of *zero-power* miners** to the Bitcoin miner network. These virtual miners act as advance sensors by participating in data dissemination, but do not mine new blocks. (Babaioff et al. also acknowledge the feasibility of such a sybil attack [4]). The virtual miners are managed by the pool, and once they hear of block X, they ignore it and start propagating block P. The **random peer-to-peer structure** of the Bitcoin overlay network will eventually propagate X to all miners, but the propagation of X under these conditions will be strictly slower than that of block P. **By adding enough virtual nodes, the pool operator can thus increase γ [gamma].**

If you note that the Bitcoin mining network is essentially a [complete graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_graph) (every significant miner has a *direct* connection to every other significant miner, with networking resources devoted to connecting to each other miner *in proportion to its demonstrated hashrate*) - not a ""random peer-to-peer structure"" but an all-to-all structure formed by the financial incentives of each miner to propagate their blocks to as much hashpower as possible as quickly as possible and to receive new blocks as quickly as possible - you can see that any such zero-hashpower virtual nodes (""spy nodes"") the SM places near the HM nodes do nothing to alert the SM of any blocks the HM releases any faster. 

In fact, insofar as the SM were to rely on these spy nodes to alert them of new HM blocks, they merely add an extra step for the SM when the HMs and SMs were all already connected to one another through very fast *direct* connections. 

The SM would be foolish to throw in an extra hop and listen through that *necessarily* slower connection. 

In that way, the effect of this attempt to increase gamma (γ) is actually negative; it would hurt the SM and help the HM. 

As a bonus point, since the prioritization of connections are of course based on proven hashpower, honest miner networking resources invested in connections to any such zero-hashpower spy nodes will be at best provisional and minimal compared to their direct connections to the main SM nodes.

If you can visualize what the shape of a complete graph network looks like under the incentives mining creates, it is easy to see that the idea that zero-hashpower spy nodes could ever help the SM could only be arrived at if the network were an entirely different shape: a loose mesh network with random connections, for example, where blocks going from one miner to another must propagate along multiple hops. 

This shows how the shape of the network, far from being an incidental feature, is crucial. The difference between a loose mesh and a complete graph means the difference between a Sybil attack hurting the network or just hurting the attacker. It means the difference between 0-conf being viable after tens of seconds or *tenths* of seconds. It means the difference between being able to partition the network by knocking out a just a few nodes and not being able to partition the network even if you knock out ALL but a few nodes. 

Can you see how this idea Craig Wright has been pounding the table about is useful and important, despite whatever you think of his character? ",1522785965

Nice! I'll ask:

Yes I’ve watched it and I’ll shortly rephrase what I’ve already said: I think Rick is a politician who perhaps means well but totally missed it with this one. By insinuating things without point blank saying what you believe, you create a situation where you can’t be held accountable for what you’re saying and that’s what he’s doing with this video. Also, I feel the Bitcoin Cash community has this thing some people call Blockstream Syndrome. Everybody is a little bit overly vigilant, I myself tend to trust less because of how that take-over went. This video feeds that and I don’t think that’s a good idea.

So long as people know that any increase in demand will increase the price of bitcoin, then there will be speculators looking to take advantage of any increase in demand.

There is nothing stopping the demand from speculators being several times greater than the demand from currency users which is a bad thing for the stability of a currency because such speculative behavior is inherently cyclical.

Whatever the underlying demand for bitcoin, there will always be additional demand from speculators and this demand is inherently unstable.

This is why no widely used currency in human history has ever been fixed supply. Good currencies have a mechanism to stop people from wildly manipulating the price by buying up shitloads of it and then flooding the market causing huge price increases and decreases. namely, some form of supply elasticity.

"I really don't think most of you understand what decentralization is. It's so rare to find that these days so it's very understandable why. Bitcoin is merely a tool and I never call it a stock. It is an investment as you are actually putting your money where your mouth is. Just like investing, making money is the very reason most people even care about it. 

A global currency is a tyrants dream. Control the money,  you have power. Bitcoin has killed this dream with decentralization. It only has the #1 spot still because it is the most decentralized (not perfect), trusted, and  tested currency. Do not forget the other 2/3 of the population ready to add to a new global economy. After much consideration, I have figured it would be highly improbable for this to happen since there are so many factors to consider with each and every nation. I am invested in anything looking close to this because for every single person to trust a currency would most likely have 1 or a few to be used. For them to be trusted, it must continue to prove easy access to anyone and decentralized. I can't stress the decentralized feature enough. Bitcoin imo has the best *chance* as a global reserve currency. ",1522785118

"The BIP133 idea was ignored by most Bitcoin Cash clients. ABC inherited it from Core, most others don't have it.

Now, remember that the same is true about zero-fee transactions. The only client that doesn't support them on the Cash chain is ABC. And this is relevant for your point that a minimum fee filter existed before.

You are half right.

What actually exists is a rate-limiter. Basically very low (including zero) fee transactions are not rejected. Instead there are only allowed a limited amount per second to be send through the network. (assuming you manage to avoid ABC nodes).

This is perfectly in line with the thinking that people sending a transaction that should confirm somewhere today, or tomorrow can send it as zero fee knowing that their wallet will retry until its mined. People that are in more of a hurry (for instance if they are engaging in some trade) will have to pay some fee.

"The trend line in the graph suggest that the natural growth for bitcoin is about 8x increase per year.

But it could be viewed a straight line of around 8000 usd increase per year.

Which might be the case over the long run, like Bitcoin hitting 100k in 12 years, that can happen, but it is extremely unlikely that it will happen as a steady growth, it will most likely be years of decline or flat prices followed by an increase into a new ATH, followed by years of decline a couple of times.

The ATH of 2013 and ATH of 2017 had a yearly average of 5000 usd increase.

If that holds we will see a 40k ATH in four years, or 50k ATH in six years.

That is if Bitcoin survives and thrives.

While it is likely that it will hit 20k at some point in the far future, the question from a long term investment perspective is how it compares to alternative investments.

Even if it is a constant growth of 8k per year, it will be outperformed by the stock market on average when it hits 80k.

If the ATH grows no faster than the stock market we will expect it to hit 100k in 2034. Adjusted for inflation it will hit 100k. Adjusted for inflation it will hit 100k in 2040.

If Bitcoin grows at the same rate as the US money supply it will increase about 4% per year adjusted for inflation.

If it grows comparable to Gold it will follow inflation over the long term.

No matter what, the longer Bitcoin lives, the lower the yearly average growth will be, the ATH from 2013-2017 had a average yearly growth of over 100% in market cap. The people hoping for 1 million ATH in 2024 is hoping that the doubling per year since 2013 will continue for five more years, extremely unlikely.

So the question can be framed, what will the annual growth between this ATH and the next one be. My guess is 25% a year, with the next ATH happening in 7-8 years.",1522783960

That's because there is no liquidity, no market depth. So Bitmain are basically stuck with their stash and are praying to the gods of crypto that a more healthy market develops for BCH. Else they will be fucking sore for having sold all those miners for BCH.

(Hint: That even Bitmain is hedging their bets should be clear since they started accepting good old fashioned fiat for the miners instead of BCH only, which was the case for some time after the fork.)

That said it can be held in many retirement accounts, etc.  The fact that it trades at such a significant premium to Bitcoin shows that there is demand for a product like that.

The CME and CBOE futures products are more liquid, track the price more closely, etc. but they are settled regularly so aren't ideal for buy and hold long term.  These products are still significantly less traded than the spot markets which have much tighter spreads, etc.

There is a bit of institutional money invested directly in spot.

-------------

&gt; The point of SegShit is to segregate the signatures so after they've been verified by a node they can easily be discarded and no longer take up space on their disk. Right?

You've been seriously misinformed. The point of segwit is to 1. fix malleability, 2. increase blocksize, 3. create incentives to spend and consolidate utxo's (and probably a couple of other things I forget).

This is achieved by redefining block structure so witness data can be segregated from tx data in a block, however *all signature data is still there in every block thats mined*.

What you are describing is called pruning. You have *always* been able to run a pruned node (a node can do whatever it wants with its data).

Let’s say you have someone in a third world country that works at a factory. They walk three miles to get there every day. Although they make very little, they are currently saving to buy some sort of vehicle to cut their transit time. (I’m sure this isn’t the situation of everyone in third world countries, but I wouldn’t say this scenario is preposterous - people *do* have to work to survive)

If you gave that person 0.1 BTC, they’d now have a lot more money, and would likely buy at least a bicycle. That has driven their local economy, as well as helping that person be more productive with their labor. Isn’t that an objectively good thing? (Esp.

"&gt; This causes more sells of BCH and thus even more price drop compared to BTC.

When everyone keeps selling, at some point BCH will drop from 4th to under 10th place on CMC and then it's game over. Institutional investors and people who aren't into crypto buy only ""blue chip"", ""quality and stable"" coins. Anything below 10th or 15th place by market cap is regarded as a risky and speculative asset, something you don't buy unless you know what you're doing. 

So, unless a pump to 0.15 or 0.2 comes near, I see BCH reaching 1/15 or 1/100 ratio to BTC. Take your text, and replace BCH with any Bitcoin's airdrop, and it'll read the same.

Because you're using the term vaporware in a categorically incorrect way. I'll reiterate for you again - vaporware is a concept that never actualizes, Ethereum's tech is actively working. I'm not sure how else to explain to you that you're using the word completely wrong.

... no. Just no. Bitcoin is a currency, not a platform. See the distinction between the two in one of my previous comments. Where are you getting that information? Anybody who understands all the amazing things that Bitcoin can facilitate knows that it's not a platform. That's not a negative thing, it's just not what it was meant to do by design. No dApps, no smart contracts. It's a currency - please go out of your way to understand that.

Say it with me, ""*Bitcoin is not a platform, bitcoin is a currency*""

That's fine, but know that calling things you don't agree with/understand ""fraudulent"" heavily diminishes your credibility as an objective investor.

For somebody who claims to not be married to bitcoin, you're sure quick to openly throw around false capabilities that it doesn't have to make it sound better. By design, Bitcoin cannot do what Ethereum does from a development perspective - and that's okay, **because they're completely different.**

"&gt;..asking how decentralized is having anyone who has a different of opinions with core developers being ostracized.

Everyone discussed and heard the merits of increasing block size vs building complicated optimizations, **for years**. Debates were held. Thousands of articles and opinion pieces were written and read by millions. Hundreds of polls were taken, the will of the multitudes was measured daily, for years, and eventually consensus was reached. Features were activated with super majority of hash power, majority of nodes, exchanges, wallets, users, and market makers. Being on the minority end of all that is not being ostracized, it's just being stubborn dissenters. If BCH supporters are ostracized from the BTC community it's for rejecting the consensus which was so painstakingly achieved after entertaining and considering their minority position for *so long*. The scaling war delayed progress over critical years when blocks were filling, only to have that whole group fork off to make their own coin anyway. 

&gt; Are you not delegating consensus to core?

Emphatically, NO. Core has made engineering decisions that encourages people like me to **participate** in the consensus process by keeping blocks small. Prioritizing that extends, preserves, and maximizes as much as possible the operation of nodes by ordinary people with ordinary computers *for the sake of decentralization*.

Yes the news broke out of his control, then they started harrassing him for proof. And then having 2 options, to provide public proof or to do it in private, considering that he didn't want public proof out there, he contacted Gavin and others like Jon Matonis. 

Bottomline, no CSW did not contact people privately. CSW signed a deal part of which were Satoshi's life rights, news broke out, papers started printing stories, and asking questions. They pressured him for proof. Wired was one of those to which he gave fake keys to discredit the story. Then he reached out to gavin for private proof to avoid public proof. 

Gavin didn't lose shit, Gavin thinks you are a piece of garbage for trying to mislead people Thomas. Ask Gavin what he thinks of people like you and what he thinks of CSW.

Moreover, here is what Gavin says in his blog post:

&gt;Part of that time was spent on a careful cryptographic verification of messages signed with keys that only Satoshi should possess.

Jihan knows that exchange and merchant support for Bitcoin Cash is important: even if the price drops temporarily. The recent price divergence from BTC comes in the wake of increased merchant adoption. Said merchants may be applying selling pressure in order to pay their suppliers in FIAT.

"&gt; mutable knock off of Bitcoin not a fraud

That was the point you've been arguing, but let's pretend that you were making the vaporware argument this whole time.

&gt;The intent of Ethereum is to create an alternative protocol for building decentralized applications, providing a different set of tradeoffs that we believe will be very useful for a large class of decentralized applications, with particular emphasis on situations where rapid development time, security for small and rarely used applications, and the ability of different applications to very efficiently interact, are important. Ethereum does this by building what is essentially the ultimate abstract foundational layer: a blockchain with a built-in Turing-complete programming language, allowing anyone to write smart contracts and decentralized applications where they can create their own arbitrary rules for ownership, transaction formats and state transition functions. A bare-bones version of Namecoin can be written in two lines of code, and other protocols like currencies and reputation systems can be built in under twenty. Smart contracts, cryptographic ""boxes"" that contain value and only unlock it if certain conditions are met, can also be built on top of the platform, with vastly more power than that offered by Bitcoin scripting because of the added powers of Turing-completeness, value-awareness, blockchain-awareness and state.

That is the first paragraph of the Ethereum whitepaper. If you quickly scan it you can see that it has delivered everything it intended to, which in no way constitutes vaporware. You really shouldn't throw around terms you don't understand - vaporware is a concept that never actualizes. Ethereum is real, and blockchain is a very young technology.

If you're calling Ethereum fraudulent, a knock-off, and vaporware because dApps haven't immediately exploded in a space that is still finding it's bearings... you clearly have some insecurities about your portfolio's future.

"&gt; change your mind in the past two days?

Good question, because if I do think the fight is bad, I shouldn't be fighting it. But as I think about it, it's been quite positive, at least for me.

Before recently, I had never really looked into selfish mining and I didn't know if the argument was sound or not. But now I've read the paper, I've seen CSW's nonsense rebuttal and Peter's review of it. I've [proved](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/88acc6/eli5_why_the_one_who_actually_doesnt_understand/dwjvm3a/) myself with simple math that withholding blocks can be beneficial even if you can never share your blocks faster than other miners. I've [argued with CSW](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/88acc6/eli5_why_the_one_who_actually_doesnt_understand/dwkl5vg/?context=1) himself and found out that he never addresses anything but just replies with nonsense. I've discovered (once again) that there are a lot of clueless people who are very sure of themselves. And I've even [changed one persons's mind](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/88jkpc/i_have_40_of_hashpower_and_i_mine_block_n1_if/dwlfr01/) slightly.

I now have more respect for Emin Gün Sirer and I definitely appreciate Peter Rizun for calling out Craig Wright's nonsense.

I can only hope it's been as positive for some other people as it has been for me.

"Just tread lightly - the charts &amp; indicators are far from foolproof. The smart money investors doing the majority of buying &amp; selling look at them too and are trapping a lot of the retail guys by setting their buy &amp; sell orders according to what we all seem to think the charts are predicting, and then doing the opposite a few hours later. 

This pattern was evident between 3/26-3/28 when BTC was trading flat, looking like consolidation and then the price would spike $200-$400 (making everyone think breakout!) only to come crashing back down in a couple hours. 

The one indicator that has been a bit more reliable (because it's harder to influence, as it depends on total daily volume, not individual price spikes) is OBV or on balance volume. It adds volume on ""up"" days and subtracts volume on ""down"" days to give you a linear representation of the trend of the market. Basically it tells you if there are more buyers or sellers. 

Technically a market needs to have equal amounts of buyers &amp; sellers to be in equilibrium - the ""0"" level on the OBV indicator. If the OBV is much higher or lower than ""0"", it means there has been excess buying or selling and you can assume that a reversal is imminent. 

Looking at the 1-D BTC/USDT charts you can see that the OBV accurately predicted the dips after the 2/19, 3/3, and 3/19 highs. In each case, volume approached equilibrium at ""0"" and quickly corrected down as the dip continued. Right now the OBV is just off of fresh lows, so we can assume that gains will continue for at least a few days.

The same thing is evident with NEO/BTC, ETH/BTC, LTC/BTC charts. Each time the 1-D OBV line approached/crossed equilibrium, a major price movement followed.  If that assumption holds, ETH may see a major move in the next couple of weeks because the OBV line is hovering just above ""0"" now. The difference is that LTC/NEO/ETH are all above equilibrium and have been for months, despite the massive price dips,  so it's anyone's guess what they do next.

In my (worthless) opinion, the BTC recovery doesn't start until we see a sustained break above the ""0"" line or at the very least a lengthy period of sideways trading along the line. So long as we stay below it, sellers outnumber buyers and the bear market continues. 

The risk to traders is that there can be huge price increases from when the OBV bottoms out to when it hits equilibrium again, so you could be leaving significant gains on the table if you don't time your buys right. ",1522778625

In November there will be another scheduled hard fork to update BCH again.  Again, I will re-evaluate it.

- If you've any transactions with coins like aeon or monero you're totally out of luck because as no one can trace coins back due to nature of privacy coins, they'll never satisfy and you lost your coins again.

ABC rejects OP_GROUP while BU supports it. Peter Rizun and CSW are constantly at each other’s throats. Here doesn’t seem to be a clear, unified strategy consistent with masterminds with ulterior motives.

"**Short squeeze**

A short squeeze is a rapid increase in the price of a stock that occurs when there is a lack of supply and an excess of demand for the stock.

Short squeezes result when short sellers cover their positions on a stock, resulting in buying volume that drives the stock price up. This can occur if the price has risen to a point where short sellers must make margin calls, or more loosely if short sellers simply decide to cut their losses and get out. This may happen in an automated manner for example if the short sellers had previously placed stop-loss orders with their brokers to prepare for this possibility.

"Fwiw, Roger didn't go ""all in"" on Bitcoin. He was already a ""self made millionaire"" as he loves to say, and invested around $10k which is virtually squat by comparison to his wealth at the time. He was smart enough to hold onto it, but that doesn't make him the economic genius that he thinks he is. 

However, I get your point that getting lucky like that is really bad for your ego. I think we're all affected by that. When the market is down, part of me wonders if this is all a huge mistake. But when the market is up, I feel like a financial genius. Luckily it all evens out on my end, probably since I'm actually able to acknowledge that I'm not a financial genius. ",1522777229

"&gt; The other forks also eliminate themselves in other ways by changing the PoW, adding pre-mines, not trying to be a currency just a SOV, or segregating the signatures so it's no longer a blockchain (of signatures).

And I suppose you're going to be the judge of what coins can be considered bitcoin of course? Why not take the simple approach and look at each time a fork happens which of the two ends up being bitcoin? I can tell you why you wont: because that would make it too clear that bcash is not bitcoin, so instead you, as I said, have to make all these mental hoops to get the outcome you like - and the more mental hoops (and now conspiracies lol) you add the more people just laugh at you because it becomes increasingly ridiculous, to the point where it starts to look like a scam. I know you don't see it like this, and thats fine, but whenever you wonder why someone might not like bcash as much as you, this is most likely the reason. You don't have to respond to this, I know *what you opinion is already*.

&gt; I think it's just you that thinks it's a scam. A bunch of exchanges, merchants, services, users and otherwise do not think it's a scam.

The currency works (like hundreds of other alts), theres no question about it, and thats not what makes it a scam. It becomes a scam when people try to assert that its the real bitcoin. It doesn't matter if you succeed in convincing people of this, but the mere fact that this is whats happening makes it a scam. Kind of like if I wanted to buy gold from you, and you told me that silver was the real gold. Sure, silver is still silver and it has the properties it has, but *selling it as gold* is a scam.",1522777077

"people here hate ripple because it goes against the original reason that bitcoin/all of crypto came around- to help the banks. Some say that they will never use the XRP token, some believe they will. Right now its at a good price relative to its ATH, so if you want to buy it, now is a good time.
(i have like $30 worth of XRP, so i'm not too biased either way)

My favorite project is REQ or Request Network, the short version is they aim to compete with paypal/venmo, as well as bring accounting to the blockchain. They recently partnered with PwC France, a division of one of the big 4 accounting firms, and main-net just launched last week. Price is at .16, ATH is 1.18, so it is down substantially and has room to grow. Also deflationary, REQ tokens get burned/destroyed with every transaction, so now that mainnet is live tokens are actively being burned.

But it's not. Remember how hard it was for the core team to implement segwit?

&gt;The DAG was too big and too many people would have lost money if Vitalik hadn't convinced the community to fork.

Less people than has lost money in various Bitcoin exchange hacks, and Bitcoin is stronger today for not rolling back those times.

Bitcoin has only been rolled back to fix issues in the Bitcoin protocol (overflow bug). Every time someone has lost money while the protocol worked as intended they've had to eat that loss themselves. Ethereum hard forked to reverse a hack of a transaction where the ethereum protocol worked as intended. That is a huge difference, and it basically set the precedent that all their talk about ""code as law"" is just marketing buzz words.

"I'm just a guy with opinions, and on the issue of censorship I doubt you'll ever find an impartial authority on the subject, so be wary of anyone who claims to ""know"". In my humble opinion:  

Some say it's a problem. The line between moderation and censorship can be pretty subjective. Much like one man's freedom fighter is another man's terrorist (and vice-versa). It seems like moderation becomes censorship when you are the one being moderated. Moderation on reddit is absolutely necessary and it's the reason both r/bitcoin and r/btc subs are moderated by moderators, according to the rules on each sub. R/bitcoin seems to be more heavily moderated, there are more complaints about false positives - the inappropriate removal of comments (but keep in mind it's the larger community so number of complaints are also relative to the population), however the upside is that fewer falsehoods are tolerated and less misinformation remains on r/bitcoin. The more you read, research and learn about all aspects of crypto the better equipped you are to distinguish between good and bad information but there will always be an element of persuasion and manipulation because some people have lots of skin in the game and language is messy. Luckily, Reddit is not the entire bitcoin community, there are plenty of alternative platforms with different moderation policies. For that reason I don't give the ""censorship"" claims that much weight. To be censored is to be silenced. There's uncountable platforms where BCH supporters have a very loud voice, twitter, medium, bitcoin.com and so on. There's the r/bch sub as well as the dominance of BCH supporters and friendly moderators here. Crying ""censorship"" is a tool used to tarnish the image of the other community and make them seem controlled, uninformed, and unscrupulous. It's used to divide the community in to tribes. This is exactly what some people and institutions want, and they gleefully encourage it.    ",1522775309

"OK, you are right. That way you can mine less but also use less electricity. The downside is that your miners are losing value while not being used. But if electricity cost is your main concern and you have a large fraction of hash power, this is an option.

It works even better if there are multiple SHA256 coins and you can switch between them. It also works better if difficulty adjusts occasionally (like with Bitcoin Core) than if it adjusts continuously (like with Bitcoin Cash).

With selfish mining, once you've made the initial loss, you can continue mining at higher profit for as long as you can sustain the selfish mining. Which works better depends on many conditions, but that doesn't mean that selfish mining doesn't work.",1522775253

"I do think that's a bit of why it turns somewhat so many things on its head.  Its not that there is no C suite of individuals.  There may be, but they are anon, or decentralized.  A lot of your argument is predicated on there being no locatable or identifiable nucleus of ownership or ""shareholder"", if there is one. In my simple understanding of corporate structures, bitcoin and its structure really possesses aspects of this in some form very specifically.   
You are investing in a decentralized company where the founder is unknown, or in this case is anon and the sales pitch is that your shares are money, easily transferable, can be used as currency.  
Not to be silly, which I am a lot, but going from your first two paragraphs to ""none of these qualities"" is quite a leap imho.  
I do think this is why the technology is revolutionary.  It dashes a lot of what institutions use as ""words""  to understand and take away power and forces them to rethink.  In the process, power switches hands because the word no longer belongs to them.

The only positive side is that he made some well delivered speeches and effective tweets about Bitcoin as an economic system and the importance of scaling on-chain.

This must be weighted against all other negatives:

-The Satoshi fake signatures story

-Wild claims of alternative Bitcoin client, new BCH mining farms and new technology that have yet to materialize. They were promised last summer as very close. How long until ""put up or shut up"" ?

-His few technical papers are unanimously dismissed by other experts, including BCH supporters, as technobabble full of nonsense

"&gt;Well, you misquoted adam back in your ""correction"" 

The misquotation (and more generally, misrepresentation) of Adam Back's quote *is the problem*. That was deliberate.

&gt;as far as I know, he never opted to clarify this statement.

The argument that ""Adam didn't feed the trolls so the trolls must be right"" is absolutely absurd; the statement is **obviously** not Adam Back claiming that he has hired ""a large team"" to debunk and disprove lying trolls online full-time... if you're demanding clarification on that, **you are proving my point rather excellently**.

Only in /r/btc would such things ever be taken seriously... this is what I'm talking about. If you guys are still harping on this ridiculous point as if you've ""caught Adam Back slipping up, bwahahaha"", imagine how much effort it would take to address your stream-on-nonsense if you had access to the full logs of a 750,000+ subscriber subreddit (which is actively attacked/brigaded by this place on a daily basis, no less).

Google **Brandolini's Law**. It is *exceptionally* relevant here.

&gt;So your argument is: since it is impossible to prove we don't censor, members of R/BTC should doxx themselves and their families for open mod logs of r/bitcoin?

Nope, that's a strawman!

My argument is: the whataboutism is quite obviously fallacious and doesn't represent a meaningful response to my comments (and the arguments and proofs therein). When it is constantly used as a distractive technique anyway (despite it being totally irrelevant to the original comment I contributed and an *obvious* attempt to change the subject, and identified as such by myself *before it even begins*, since it is so predictable at this point), it is just as valid for me to ""fight fire with fire"" and respond in kind. And furthermore, there is no fundamental difference between the format of ""Well I accuse you of censoring so now to prove you don't you have to turn over comprehensive records of your subreddit's moderator activity, for both you *and* the other mods there"" and ""Well I accuse you of human trafficking so now to prove you don't you have to turn over comprehensive records of your financial activity, for both you *and* your other family members"". They're effectively the same type of request, with the same justificatory logic and the same overentitled, blanket-style demand.

The reason why I have chosen ""human trafficking"" and ""comprehensive financial records from you and your family"" as the specific accusation and solution, respectively, is because it is *so absurd* that no one could possibly take it seriously as a demand, and no one would ever be able to make a strong case that this is a legitimate request... **and crucially, it's the same exact argument/demand that is being made.** The parallel is beautiful, and serves as an excellent *reductio ad absurdum* (which, unfortunately, only I ever seem to appreciate).

&gt;It is clearly a disproportionate amount of information you are asking for.

Bingo!

&gt;I think you should give people credit.

I give reasonable people credit. Almost no one here falls in that category. This place is filled with more liars than any other community I've ever borne witness to.

I'm not trying to be mean or rude, it's the unfortunate reality of the situation. If this place wasn't such a disgusting, reprehensible cesspool, I guarantee the mod logs would have started being published long ago. You want a culprit? Take a long hard look around you.

&gt;The argument has always been that the mods of r/Bitcoin go beyond that.

The argument is, apparently, also that ""SegWit isn't Bitcoin"" and ""SegWit isn't a blocksize increase."" The argument is (according to you, it would seem) that Adam Back is paying a large team of people as professional Internet trollfighters. ""The argument"" isn't a strong one, no matter how repeated around here it is.

Honestly, the correlation is the *other* way around. The more repeated and echoed an argument is made around here, the *less* likely it is to be true.

Notice that the hashrate isn't flippening. Notice that the BCH:BTC price ratio continues to diverge (that's a nice way to say ""steadily drop""), and notice how everyone here pretends like this is no big deal, when just a few months ago, it was quite obvious that both of these facts were *all-important* to this sad little community.

You're not winning, and you're never right. You got played. **Jihan Wu's exact words about Bitcoin Cash were: [Let us work together, dumping it to the bag holders.](https://twitter.com/JihanWu/status/899451148351844352?s=20)** and you guys *still* refuse to face reality head-on. This place is a joke, and BCH is *not* Bitcoin. I'm sorry.

&gt;I got banned for suggesting somebody consider Bitcoin Cash it they wanted a ""round"" number of Bitcoins.

Oh, you broke the subreddit rules by knowingly promoting a contentious altcoin that tries to masquerade as Bitcoin, *by lying and trying to convince someone that it was Bitcoin*, and you were banned for doing so? **What a surprise!**

That was dumb of you, and it was deceptive of you, too. You deserved your ban, and if you have half a brain, you knew that you would be banned for your deliberate and dishonest shilling, and *yet you did it anyway*.

&gt;For the record, when people say ""Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin"", they are referring to the vision outlined in the original whitepaper.

Yes, I know. They're lying about it representing ""the vision outlined in the original whitepaper"" because their only pitch is a lie, and their only gambit is to try to milk the Bitcoin brand name deceptively.

&gt;To distinguish the two I try to use ""Bitcoin segwit"", others use ""Bitcoin core"".

Yes, that is a deceptive and dishonest practice. There is Bitcoin, and there are altcoins (like BCH), which are **not** Bitcoin and can be distinguished by merely making this clear in references to them. Notice that Bitcoin Gold doesn't try to pretend that it is Bitcoin, and no one ever gets confused about it. Notice that Bitcoin Diamond is similarly unafflicted. That's because the supporters of these coins aren't lying bagholders desperate to convince newbies that their off-brand Chinese knockoff is the real deal.

&gt;However, that seems to either offend some people, or be a talking point for people claiming hypocrisy.

Yes, and yet you do it anyway. You should be ashamed.

&gt;Notice that the ""censored"" posts you linked to earlier used an offensive term to describe ""Bitcoin Cash""

It's a shortening of the name, not ""an offensive term"", and it's actually a better name than the deceptive and misleading ""full name"" because it helps to distinguish the altcoin for what it is (despite its deceptive community's best pathetic efforts).

&gt;It demeans the project by removing ""Bitcoin"" from the name. 

If you guys insist on trying to lie and mislead others (which you're doing in this very comment), it is simply a straightforward way to set the record straight. There is ""Bitcoin"" and there is ""Bcash""; look, problem solved! We don't need confusing terms like ""SegWit"" (which newbies would have a hard time remembering, and also doesn't actually clarify anything about **Bitcoin**, the same **Bitcoin** that has been chugging along since 2009 and uses the same old BTC ticker it always has... Bitcoin SegWit would probably need a BSW or BTCS ticker) or ""Core"" (which is software and a node implementation, like ""Bitcoin ABC"", and not a network or currency unit, like ""ether"" or ""bitcoins""). Both names are short, catchy, memorable, and straightforward! 

The only reason you find ""Bcash"" demeaning is because *the entire value proposition of the coin is to deceptively pretend like it is Bitcoin proper and ride the coat-tails of the real thing*, which is sad and pitiful, and deep down, you realize this. Without the ""Bitcoin"" in the name, you have nothing.

&gt;I noticed that your posts linking to such logs usually have a score of around -2. That is people expressing mild disagreement. They are not actively censoring your posts.

I never claimed my comments were being deleted, and most downvotes in this place usually show up a day or two after the comments are made (one of *many* indications that this place has a nasty bot infestation to help steer the narrative in Ver's preferred direction).

Now, watch as I predict with uncanny accuracy what is about to happen: if you bother to respond at all, you will leave the *vast* majority of my points unacknowledged and ignored. You won't bother addressing most of what I just said, because you frankly don't have any good answers.

But keep shilling that altcoin and trying to convince people it's the real Bitcoin. Maybe if Ver sets up a TV interview and orchestrates a brief pump and dump you'll see a ratio above 0.1 again...",1522774808

I think for crypto to really take off (and stay there) it needs to have more appeal to the masses. Things like one wallet for all coins so you don't need so many different ones or an easy way to change alts to fiat. People don't like confusing things ,1522774115

"*Wright, Andresen says, offered to perform the second test, signing a message of Andresen's choosing with a key from the first ""block"" of 50 coins ever claimed by a Bitcoin miner, in this case Nakamoto himself. (He also performed a similar test for Jon Matonis, a former board member of the Bitcoin Foundation, and a reporter for the Economist, the magazine says, using both the first and ninth Bitcoin blocks.) Andresen says he demanded that the signature be checked on a completely new, clean computer. ""I didn’t trust them not to monkey with the hardware,"" says Andresen.
Andresen says an administrative assistant working with Wright left to buy a computer from a nearby store, and returned with what Andresen describes as a Windows laptop in a ""factory-sealed"" box. They installed the Bitcoin software Electrum on that machine. For their test, Andresen chose the message ""Gavin's favorite number is eleven."" Wright added his initials, ""CSW,"" and signed the message on his own computer. Then he put the signed message on a USB stick belonging to Andresen and they transferred it to the new laptop, where Andresen checked the signature.
At first, the Electrum software's verification of the signature mysteriously failed. But then Andresen noticed that they'd accidentally left off Wright's initials from the message they were testing, and checked again: The signature was valid.
""It’s certainly possible I was bamboozled,"" Andresen says. ""I could spin stories of how they hacked the hotel Wi-fi so that the insecure connection gave us a bad version of the software. But that just seems incredibly unlikely. It seems the simpler explanation is that this person is Satoshi.""*

"The problem starts with the language CSR used in his paper and goes down hill from there.  He makes simple things complex and obscures the error of simple things.  Also,  he uses non-standard language which further obfuscates matters.  For example:  the example time line in figure 1 is not a state table.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_transition_table

As to ""gamma"" that's just a Greek letter that represents a variable name.  It can be used in different contexts.  As a further indication of the poor quality of CSR's paper, at the end he uses the word without ever defining it.  There is no indication that his usage corresponds to the parameter appearing in Fig 2 of http://fc14.ifca.ai/papers/fc14_submission_82.pdf

I've had decades of time to learn when it is a waste of time to argue with people who are incapable of clearly communicating their ideas through concise and clear language and mathematical knowledge.  In addition, I've seen many people apparently create confusion deliberately,  although sometimes it can be difficult to separate confusion from deliberate obfuscation.  Unfortunately the field of crypto currency does not lack confused people or toxic obfuscators.

Then, they hype the shit out of it, 'biggest partnership in crypto, sending us to top 3 CMC'. Lmao. If that is not just blatantly trying to pump the coin based on their insider information (if it does exist), I don't know what is.

Furthermore, why would the 'biggest partnership in crypto' happen with an unprofessional dev team who can't miss deadlines, hilariously under-deliver on their promises, and are so poorly capitalized that they need to run scammy crowdfunding campaigns?

"&gt;No, I meant one. **One was a post** about how to claim gold, which seemed like a useful post so I have no idea why it was removed. **The other post about gold**...

One plus one equals two, my man.

&gt;it honestly was a pretty googleable question

So there's an unwritten rule that ""pretty googleable questions are fair game for removal"" now? Funny how even *that* isn't enforced consistently... oh dear, was my point just proven, ***again?***

&gt;Pretty much any sub moderated by mere humans has this problem (only exception I can really think if it's subs with super strict and clear rules like askscience or askhistorians).

What's funny is that /r/Bitcoin is a lot like these subreddits; there are clearly defined rules that are enforced consistently, and if you violate them, you can reasonably expect your violating content to be removed. These two example subreddits get a bit of flak every now and then for their policies, too... the only real distinction is that *with Bitcoin, money is on the line*, so the ""flak"" is from well-funded, unscrupulous antagonists like Ver who have the means and motivation to sustain an attack for extended intervals of time and on surprising scales.

&gt;What me and most of the reasonable people who post here point out is that this sub is not blanket censored, while yours often is.

Perhaps you thought that if you call yourself ""reasonable"" right before you make a false statement, that will help it sound truer? It didn't really work here, but I respect the attempt. Actually, I'll be honest: I don't really respect the attempt. I'm sorry for saying I did.

&gt;Do occasional posts here about forks get removed? Yes.

From what I've seen, for every one post here that is about a Bitcoin-airdrop fork (other than BCH, of course), at least ten are removed. If you restrict it to ""only *positive* posts about these forks"" the ratio is much worse.

I believe that BCH related content is actually allowed more often in /r/Bitcoin than any content about the other forks is allowed here. What makes this (much) worse is:

1) This subreddit doesn't have an official policy *against* these types of posts, *but removes them silently anyway* (at least in /r/Bitcoin we are up front about our policies and enforce them directly and consistently; altcoin talk belongs elsewhere, and promotion of altcoins and contentious consensus-changing software is prohibited unless near-universal support for it is achieved; this doesn't mean that contentious changes are prohibited from being *discussed*, of course, but that's a point no one here wants to acknowledge).

2) The users here (like you) try to pretend like this place is much more ""tolerant of free speech"" than it is, and when faced with proof to the contrary, will rush to rationalize (or ignore) it at all costs, cognitive dissonance be damned. Your response here is a perfect example of this in action.

&gt;Do weeks go by where every single mention of any possible fork gets nuked, along with any post pointing out that censorship? No.

Yes, actually. Suppress that cognitive dissonance as hard as you can, though!

&gt;Even r/bitcoin is inconsistent: sometimes you can talk about things like block size increases, other times you get banned for being an altcoin shiller.

It's consistent, it sounds like you just haven't spent thirty seconds learning what the actual policies are and understanding them.

&gt; I honestly wouldn't mind it if the sub were called /r/bitcoinCore or even /r/bitcoinNews or something like that,

That's not what the subreddit is about, though. It's about Bitcoin.

&gt;when there is a huge minority opinion, like it or not, and the majority actively stifles it

A ""huge minority opinion""? Setting aside this silly phrasing, and the comical overrepresentation it boils down to (as any metric will show), nothing is being stifled. You can't promote technical attacks on the Bitcoin network, and whether you are knowledgeable enough of distributed consensus protocols to recognize what these look like, that's a pretty reasonable policy.

Frankly, it looks like this boils down to ignorance on your end. I know you won't like to hear that, but it's how it looks from an informed perspective.

&gt;This discussion needs to happen.

It can happen, just like discussion of U.S. politics can happen... just not in venues where it's not on-topic (at least not excessively). If this splinter community wasn't so disgustingly aggressive and immoral (trying to attack and antagonize every single day), I guarantee you things would loosen up to a degree, because the moderation wouldn't be completely necessary to keep things from collapsing into a cesspool (like this place has undeniably become).

&gt;The very fact that you were even able to compile that list is because here we have a link in the sidebar to the moderation logs.

...and note how much good they're doing: **none**. In fact, they're just doing harm, because we're arguing with one another rather than discussing Bitcoin. *We're filling this subreddit with even more off-topic noise that doesn't do any good*, and it's mostly because of those logs (well, that and your obstinate refusal to acknowledge the facts of the matter honestly, and my willingness to feed the trolls).

&gt;Ok, I've spent enough time on this. If you have any other actual points I'll address them, if you want to further blow up at me by misunderstanding my sentences, I'll be ignoring your response.

Oh, I'm full of points, but you aren't able to appreciate them (much less address them), it would seem. So I guess that's that. Take it easy.",1522772009

I wish politics could be kept off this subreddit. Hopefully it's obvious to most readers by the comments that bitcoiners have varying opinions on the ""refugee""/""migrant"" issue. I'd say I don't understand why this post requesting help is OK, but a post helping, e.g., a group like PEGIDA would not be OK. But I do understand. Reddit has owners and they have to be kept happy. PEGIDA and like minded groups would be a more natural choice for bitcoin support since European governments are actively oppressing them, raiding them, fining them, jailing them, unlike the ""More Refugees Now!"" groups that are often supported by NGOs who are in turn supported through government grants. Blah, blah, no one cares. It's too late anyway. Europe's future has been chosen over decades. Merkel's policy was just the final nail.

A speculation is more like a future-casting mindset that has to imagine the implications and make some decisions.

The good thing you can say about bitcoin is that it's so risky that everyone can see a lot of different risks with it, so to some degree risk is priced in.

But in ""risk free"" stuff, or things that seem nearly risk free (mortgage backed securities as an example), you're not getting paid to take on the risk, so you get left (or someone - taxpayers!) gets left holding the back on that risk free crap.

And I *have used* the mod logs to determine if it was the mods or reddit removing posts in the past.

So your argument is: since it is impossible to prove we don't censor, members of R/BTC should doxx themselves and their families for open mod logs of r/bitcoin?

It is clearly a disproportionate amount of information you are asking for. I think you should give people credit. We understand that moderation is a thankless job. When you filter a lot of crap: you are going top get a few false-positives.

The argument has always been that the mods of r/Bitcoin go beyond that. I got banned for suggesting somebody consider Bitcoin Cash it they wanted a ""round"" number of Bitcoins.

For the record, when people say ""Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin"", they are referring to the vision outlined in the original whitepaper. They are not claiming that Bitcoin Cash is the implementation known on exchanges and in the popular media as ""Bitcoin"". To distinguish the two I try to use ""Bitcoin segwit"", others use ""Bitcoin core"". However, that seem to either offend some people, or be a talking point for people claiming hypocrisy.

Notice the the ""censored"" posts you linked to earlier used an offensive term to describe ""Bitcoin Cash"". It demeans the project by removing ""Bitcoin"" from the name.

My best totally will and unsubstantiated guess is that Craig Wright actually was involved in the early creation of bitcoin and that ""Satoshi"" was never actually a single person. It doesn't mean that Craig invented bitcoin himself, just that he may have been around and he or his former partner maybe did some of the early mining or somehow got access to a key for the proof to Gavin.

It has always been a hell of a ride up and down and sideways. When a responsible individual is determining their next investment, one of the first things you do is look at historical performance, and a simple look at the marketcap would have told you exactly how much of a volatile industry crypto is. A responsible individual then either goes ahead and accepts the emotional rollercoaster, of doesn't go ahead and invests in an asset class more in tune with their risk acceptance. The people that bought in during the bull run, and are now selling forcing funds to close, clearly did not understand what they were buying and the risks involved, so I do not trust their investment judgement.

"&gt; I personnaly think a system where people act honest following incentives (being honest is post the profitable behavior)

Which would be fantastic if such a system existed, but anarchism nor anarcho-capitalism, nor (Jesus Christ I can't believe some people believe this) voluntarysm provide these incentives. Psychopathic and parasitic behaviours are  prominent both in humanity and the animal kingdom precisely because they provide clear individual advantages in the context of otherwise self-altruistically organised systems (societies). Not to mention, even in systems well-dedigned according to incentives (such as bitcoin), people will sometimes attempt or do evil, which is why bitcoin isn't called ""a p2p, electronic honor system"". It needs to be encrypted and thought of adversarially. And in the real world, a system that both punishes and dissuades evil-doers (with a couple of extra functions such as rehabilitation and removal of truly dangerous individuals), such as an effective judicial system, is necessary.

Let me put it this way: I personally know literally dozens of psychiatrists (and even more clinical psychologists), and despite their observed tendency for progressive political opinions, there isn't a single one of them to whom I've posed the question, that don't consider anarchism an unfounded, delusional, and unachievable fantasy in reality.

Nyāya (Sanskrit: न्याय, ny-āyá), literally means ""rules"", ""method"" or ""judgment"". It is also the name of one of the six orthodox (astika) schools of Hinduism. This school's most significant contributions to Indian philosophy was systematic development of the theory of logic, methodology, and its treatises on epistemology.

Nyaya school's epistemology accepts four out of six Pramanas as reliable means of gaining knowledge – Pratyakṣa (perception), Anumāṇa (inference), Upamāṇa (comparison and analogy) and Śabda (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts).

"&gt;How do I validate that you've done an objective due diligence with checking Carol's Logs? You didn't provide me with any means necessary to check them, while Eve's logs is open for everybody to see.

In the context of our discussion here, you currently cannot. The best options *currently* available on this front, as I see it, are the following:

A) Take my word for it. Perhaps perform a personal investigation on my character (using my publicly-accessible account history) to see if you can identify whether or not I am a reliable and trustworthy source of information, or a dishonest or unscrupulous individual. When it comes to factual statements that you have the means to check firsthand, see whether what I have said is true (even if it is not a truth you're personally fond of), and form an impression of what that means about the likely veracity of the claims I have made with regards to the things that you are *not* currently able to verify firsthand.

This option represents a combination of  all four [Nyāyan Pramanas: Pratyakṣa (perception), Anumāṇa (inference), Upamāṇa (comparison and analogy) and Śabda (word, testimony of reliable experts)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyaya); this wouldn't serve as definitive proof but would certainly form a foundation for justified belief.

B) Try to gain personal access to the logs in question, i.e. become a moderator of /r/Bitcoin. This would basically require being a helpful, honest, and reliable contributor to the subreddit for an extended period of time, a schedule that allows for regular moderation on your part, no existing relevant conflicts-of-interest (i.e. you can't work for Blockstream or Bitcoin(dot)com), and the willingness to take part in the (frankly, exceptionally thankless) volunteer work of keeping the subreddit clean. Related experience would be a bonus.

C) Try to convince me (or another moderator, or an admin) to provide *limited* access to particular excerpts (or screenshots, or whatever) that are relevant to whatever issue you're currently trying to investigate. If the ""issue"" is something like ""I just want to see every single mod action ever performed"" then this basically reduces to option B. Note: my claim here is that *I don't see evidence of inconsistent and non-rule-based moderation of the subreddit*, so if you wanted to investigate further than I have, you'd need the same level of access that I do. In other words, I'm not able to provide you an example of inconsistent moderation of /r/Bitcoin like I was able to with /r/btc (even though I have access to the logs of both), so unless you have a specific request of an instance where you believe mismoderation occurred, it's going to be hard or impossible to help with that.

D) Try to convince us with access (using rational arguments) that fully publishing open logs to the world at large is a good idea. Note: you're not going to have any luck in doing so unless you're able to recognize and truly take into account just how absurdly dishonest and malicious so many users in **this** subreddit/community are when it comes to the Bitcoin subreddit and community. It is going to be a colossal task, because *so many outright lies are embraced by the people here*... ""Bitcoin Cash *is* Bitcoin"" and ""Adam Back admitted that he pays a team of people full-time to argue/troll/debunk/whatever on the Internet"" and ""/r/btc is censorship-free and we value free speech"" and ""SegWit coins aren't real bitcoins"" and ""SegWit isn't a blocksize increase"" and ""Blockstream control Bitcoin"" and ""Everyone agreed that we should increase the blocksize but Core centrally controls the network and refused to increase the blocksize"" and ""Development in BCH is truly decentralized unlike in BTC"" and ""Roger Ver is a trustworthy and honest person who has not been caught lying many, many times"" and ""I was banned from /r/Bitcoin for no legitimate reason"" and ""Gregory Maxwell was proven to be controlling sockpuppets and downvote bots to attack rbtc"" and ""there is mathematical proof that the Lightning Network can't work"" and ""Lightning Network is just making Bitcoin into a banking network and/or represents a bank takeover of Bitcoin""; there are countless other lies that are trumpeted around here on a daily basis, despite the fact that some of us will spend time carefully, thoroughly, and definitively debunking them only to see our work downvoted and dismissed and to receive personal insults as a response. This is off the top of my head and typed into my phone, but trust me, I could keep going.

The point here is that this community is willing to *weaponize* information, and doesn't seem interested in the honest representation of it **at all**. Even when the truth is *directly verifiable*, it doesn't seem to have much of an impact around here, no matter how patiently it is provided. And each of the example statements above *is* a lie; these are not valid and honest ""alternative interpretations"" or ""different perspectives"", these are falsehoods actively and deliberately perpetuated by an antagonistic subcommunity which seems motivated primarily by it's opposition to Bitcoin. In short: it is fair to summarize this place as *Bitcoin's worst enemy right now*, and the users of this subreddit are the only ones who seem interested in the /r/Bitcoin moderator logs. So if your ""request for universal access"" doesn't properly acknowledge this aspect of the matter, understand that we have no obligation (or even meaningful incentive) to satisfy it, and in all honesty, we've probably spent more time thinking about the matter than you have. As it is, having an informational advantage has helped us to maintain the quality of our subreddit in a number of different ways and dimensions, and whether the users here like it or not, they're not entitled to any logs we don't want to grant them. So we have good reasons to keep some things private (not all of which, or even most of which, I intend to disclose), and I don't see much good that will come of changing the status quo (it's not like ""getting to the truth of the matter"" is a real priority of the demanders, anyway).

The appropriate game theoretic response is to keep things how they are. Perhaps you will be able to change our mind(s) on the matter, but you almost certainly won't by pretending reality away.

So, as I see it, those are the options.

Final note: you can see most of the thread removals (the vast majority, if I'm not mistaken), and the reasons for them, just by looking over the /u/rBitcoinMod account history. It's not perfect, but it's something.",1522769324

"Notable Changes
DNS Bootstrapping
Reported issues concerning the initial automatic peer bootrapping via DNS have been resolved. In the case that lnd had to fallback to direct TCP resolution, a bug prevented the DNS name from being fully qualified. This new release ensures we craft a valid DNS query.

Channel Funding
The min channel size that we'll create outbound has been raised to 20k satoshis.

When using the current version of autopilot users can now set the min and max channel sizes. Before this change, as this mode was primarily used on testnet, the default pilot would at times create a single channel using all available funds, which in many cases is undesirable.

Users are now able to set a custom value for the CSV parameter imposed on the remote node using the new --remote_csv_delay argument of the openchannel command. This is useful as peers that have existing business relationships may wish to relax the time-based security parameter in order to allow swift channel force closures.

A rounding error (#943) has been fixed. This would at times be an issue when converting from BTC to satoshis as returned by the various RPC interfaces. With this fix we ensure that we can no longer at times leaks a few satoshis when creating channels. On-chain sends were unaffected.

RPC
The ListChannels command now has the ability to filter out active, public, private, and inactive channels (#834). The lncli listchannels command has also gained the ability to filter out these channels with the following new arguments:

--active_only
--inactive_only
--public_only
--private_only
A new macaroon type has been added! In this release, lnd will now generate an invoice.macaroon invoice. The capabilities that this macaroon can unlock are restricted only to: listing invoices, generating invoices, subscribing for invoice notifications, and also generating new addresses (#904).

One thing to note is that we'll only generate the invoice macaroon if none of the macaroons are found. This mirrors the existing behavior to allow an instance to be spun up, only having a particular macaroon in its data directory. In order for this new macaroon to be generated, users need to delete their old set of macaroons on disk.

Payment routing
Several cross-implementation payment routing issues have been resolved. Users should find they have an easier time routing directly to another implementation, or taking a route that traverses other implementations. Additionally, we'll now more aggressively route around any faulty channels.nodes based on prior routing failures encountered.

Configuration
A new --tlsdomain config line option has been added (#864). This allows users to generate RPC certs that themselves bind to a particular domain. With this command, users are now able to expose an lnd RPC service that's accessed directly via a domain over TLS.

A new --minchansize config option has been added. This option allows users to configure the smallest channel size they'll accept as an incoming payment. Using this command, users can start to filter out the set of incoming channel requests in order to ensure their node has a healthy set of usable channels. The default value for this is 20k satoshis.

Channel State Machine
A bug that would at times cause channel desynchronization when channels peers use asymmetric dust values has been resolved (#920).

We'll now ensure that we'll only accept sane commitments. This entails performing a series of quick checks for standardness and context-free consensus rules when we create or accept new commitments. Uncompliant commitments will be rejected.

We'll now accept incoming payments that pay more than the amount stated on the invoice.

Attempted cooperative channel closures while a commitment still has lingering HTLCs are now disallowed.

Litecoin
Several minor bugs have been fixed within lnd's Litecoin mode. The most notable fix is properly using a sane dust value to ensure we only produce easily mineable commitments.

bitcoind Chain Backend
The bitcoind chain backend will now properly reconnect to bitcoind's interface for zmq in the case of a connection drop, or restart by bitcoind (c653b62).

Peer to Peer Networking
We'll no longer disconnect peers that send address types within NodeAnnouncement messages that we don't know of. This caused unnecessary connection flapping in the prior release as there are several nodes on mainnet which forward such messages (which is spec compliant).

A series of bugs have been fixed concerning automatic peer reconnection (#982), exponential backoff when retrying connections to peers. Additionally, we'll now properly perform the brontide handshake asynchronously (#1001). As a result of these fixes, users should see overall lower memory usage and less pending connection manager requests. Subsequent releases will start to introduce dynamic ban/DoS protection to further harden lnds P2P interface.

Build System
This new release of lnd packages an easier to use build system for those that are unfamiliar with go. lnd now has a primary Makefile. A new set of documentation has been added to detail the various commands and arguments of each make directive:

https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/MAKEFILE.md
When using the make build command, lnd will compile in the commit hash that it was built against. This is helpful when debugging as it makes it easier to bisect git commits. Additionally, users will be able to easy discern which commit (in addition to latest released version) that they're running:

⛰./lnd --version

"&gt;&gt;To be fair, I don't know why the one post about claiming gold was removed, but that's one post.

&gt;Um, you mean **two**?

No, I meant one. One was a post about how to claim gold, which seemed like a useful post so I have no idea why it was removed. The other post about gold was a question, and without context I have no idea why it was removed but it honestly was a pretty googleable question, and at the time I remember seeing plenty of posts about what bitcoin gold was.

I never said it wasn't. Pretty much any sub moderated by mere humans has this problem (only exception I can really think if it's subs with super strict and clear rules like askscience or askhistorians). What me and most of the reasonable people who post here point out is that this sub is not blanket censored, while yours often is. Do occasional posts here about forks get removed? Yes. Do weeks go by where every single mention of any possible fork gets nuked, along with any post pointing out that censorship? No. Even r/bitcoin is inconsistent: sometimes you can talk about things like block size increases, other times you get banned for being an altcoin shiller. I honestly wouldn't mind it if the sub were called /r/bitcoinCore or something like that, but when there is a huge minority opinion, like it or not, and the majority actively stifles it, I find that unacceptable. This discussion needs to happen. This very discussion we're having now probably couldn't even exist in the other sub. The very fact that you were even able to compile that list is because here we have a link in the sidebar to the moderation logs.

"&gt; not to me. i boycott business that misbehave

What is hijacking and sabotaging the entire project such that it loses almost all of its dominance in the market, and most of the unique differentiating value propositions that actually make it valuable, if not ""misbehaving""? And if you boycott businesses that ""misbehave"" you should've boycotted Blockstream long ago.

On the other hand instead you say you boycotted businesses that thought segwit was a bad idea, and would only signal for it if the long term sabotage Blockstream was imposing on the chain was let off. When that was the status quo, they then reneged on it, thus further cementing themselves as clearly the most malevolent and bad faith actors in all of cryptospace, and yet here you are defending them as if it were *they* who were the besieged defenders of all that is good and right in the world, even in the overwhelming empirical evidence that segwit and lightning are abject failures.

&gt; i use it

Which has zero bearing on the throughput drop responsible for the drop in fees absent any actual fix to the Blockstream imposed sabotage limit.

&gt; it's always been this way.

No, actually, this is the worst performing quarter in the entire history of the currency. Even the abject idiocy of Mt Gox. didn't result in this rapid of a plunge. Blockstream are objectively more of a catastrophe for Bitcoin than that laughable episode.

That's some pretty impressive doublethink. Orwell would be proud.

&gt; there are a ton of alts. let's see how it fares when LN is out of beta

And they have traction and acceptance because Core sabotaged and hijacked the original Bitcoin, and the split to rectify that situation has people responding in this way, crying out that hard fork to execute the original vision was the attack, rather than the defence from the very clear sabotage that was taking place. 

LN will never succeed at anything aside from putting the control of core squarely back into the hands of the mainstream banking powers, at best. At worst, it will destroy the BTC currency entirely as people realise that is the inevitable outcome, and make the obvious choice in light of it to abandon ship.

&gt; MOD: Luke is a crazy freak, he thinks geocentric theory is right ME: according to relativity theory there is no preference for the point of view, so Luke is technically not wrong MOD: banhammer

Really interested to see this, Link? I've even seen that exact conversation and sure didn't notice people getting banned there, but of course, most people were just pointing out how idiotic geocentric theory in this day and age is, I can't rightly say I actually recall anyone saying he might be potentially right. But even if they were that wrong, that is indeed no reason to ban them, as at last your argument is technically correct, if not empirically laughable, especially considering how heavily luke leans on the ""Well this must be the truth, because the holy infallible church says so"" argument in his geocentric answers paper, so please, do show.

&gt; i felt so. and BCH could have split peacefully without the propaganda and the 2x

Your feelings don't actually change the facts, though. It takes a lot to move past that and accept it, I know, but some day I hope you manage. As for ""propaganda"", I don't see any, merely statements of fact as to what actually happened; Blockstream hijacked and sabotaged core, core is a broken shitty implementation that hollows out the actual purpose of peer to peer electronic cash and imposes architecture suitable for the re-reinstatement of Bretton Woods by another means, and their ability to levy tolls on all of the chokepoints which they forced into the ecosystem.

Not to mention, 2x was a DCG initiative, and they're in the Blockstream camp, so you're attributing that to the wrong side of the fence also. They effectively set up a strawman, then stabbed their own deal in the back to get an unpopular and shitty change implemented on chain. Hardly something you can hold the other side responsible for with any degree of integrity.

In light of all of the above, hard forking off and even having the courtesy to  implement replay protection to insulate core fanatics from the consequences of their own idiotic decisions is pretty much the definition of ""split peacefully"".

&gt; satoshi was inspired by Szabo's work which has 2 layers (white paper), invented payment channels, designed bitcoin to permit them, put the 1Mb limit in place and said ""users will become increasingly tyrannical with blockchain space. i believe the evidence is pretty clear

Right, it's not like he ever said [this, for example] (http://i.imgur.com/ok74kiT.jpg). That's a Roger Ver fabrication or something, right?

Also, I notice you falsely conflating ""2 layers"" with ""the implementation of lightning via segwit"". They're not remotely the same thing, and the fact you pretend they are in this offhand way makes me think actually you're being disingenuous and not intellectually honest about this discussion at all. You don't seem interested in the truth, you just want to seem like you're right, in spite of the fact that you're very clearly wrong.

"From the [whitepaper on Mining Centralization](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper#mining-centralization). 


&gt; The Bitcoin mining algorithm works by having miners compute SHA256 on slightly modified versions of the block header millions of times over and over again, until eventually one node comes up with a version whose hash is less than the target (currently around 2192). However, this mining algorithm is vulnerable to two forms of centralization. First, the mining ecosystem has come to be dominated by ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits), computer chips designed for, and therefore thousands of times more efficient at, the specific task of Bitcoin mining. This means that Bitcoin mining is no longer a highly decentralized and egalitarian pursuit, requiring millions of dollars of capital to effectively participate in. Second, most Bitcoin miners do not actually perform block validation locally; instead, they rely on a centralized mining pool to provide the block headers. This problem is arguably worse: as of the time of this writing, the top three mining pools indirectly control roughly 50% of processing power in the Bitcoin network, although this is mitigated by the fact that miners can switch to other mining pools if a pool or coalition attempts a 51% attack.

&gt; The current intent at Ethereum is to use a mining algorithm where miners are required to fetch random data from the state, compute some randomly selected transactions from the last N blocks in the blockchain, and return the hash of the result. This has two important benefits. First, Ethereum contracts can include any kind of computation, so an **Ethereum ASIC would essentially be an ASIC for general computation - ie. a better CPU** . Second, mining requires access to the entire blockchain, forcing miners to store the entire blockchain and at least be capable of verifying every transaction. This removes the need for centralized mining pools; although mining pools can still serve the legitimate role of evening out the randomness of reward distribution, this function can be served equally well by peer-to-peer pools with no central control.

&gt; This model is untested, and there may be difficulties along the way in avoiding certain clever optimizations when using contract execution as a mining algorithm. **However, one notably interesting feature of this algorithm is that it allows anyone to ""poison the well"", by introducing a large number of contracts into the blockchain specifically designed to stymie certain ASICs**. The economic incentives exist for ASIC manufacturers to use such a trick to attack each other. Thus, the solution that we are developing is ultimately an adaptive economic human solution rather than purely a technical one.

Instead of focusing on a fork, maybe we should be focusing on the plan to poison the well?",1522767675

You can use bitcoin core as your wallet or point your mobile wallet to use your own node. If nothing else, installing and running your own full node helps you learn and makes you want to learn more. Try installing it on both and see which you prefer

It is best to run it 24/7 (my server is on all the time anyway) but if you shut it down periodically for a day or two, it takes a little while to catch up when restarted as it needs to download and verify all the recent blocks added to the chain.",1522767269

Your post addresses an issue of posts being removed seemingly driven by political reasons and I acknowledge that. Now, since you're after the three questions first-- I'll answer them right away.


&gt;1.) Do you realize that my initial contribution to this thread was factually true, and that I later proved it so by linking to direct corroboration of the claims therein?


I've examined the links you've provided (although; I've only examined a few of r/btc's threads partly because I've seen them in the past) and yes, I acknowledge them to be factually true. I do honestly say that I don't understand why some of the threads were removed under 'spam'. I'd say it calls for some explanation from u/BitcoinXio's part? You consistently mentioned that r/bitcoin favours an authorititative method of enforcing the rules as it is written which I recognise and would commend.


&gt;2.) Do you realize that I also *explicitly predicted* the whataboutism that you (and many others) are currently trying to perform in your collective attempts to change the subject to that of the moderation policies/activity of a subreddit other than this one?


If it appears to be so, I apologise. My questioning is an attempt to ensure that sufficient equal analysis has been made and no bias was applied; which you delivered.


3.) Do you understand the exchange between Alice and Bob (included in my previous comment as well as this one), and how appropriately it parallels our own conversation? &lt;Snipped the Conversation for brevity&gt;


I understand the exchange you demonstrated, however I think that you may have missed what I am trying to ask from you. It was to ensure that you haven't applied bias when analysing r/btc. If you did so around this thread, I did not follow everyone else's responses. I mostly observe only the comments that are directed at me.


Hopefully those answers are sufficient. Now, further comments...


My only problem with that is if you do remove a particular comment or reply from a user in r/bitcoin, there is no way for any users to validate whether or not the moderators have done so reasonably and without political intent. Simply stating that you're an active moderator of the subreddit is-- I believe-- insufficient to warrant trust that you're telling the truth. If I may re-demonstrate your Alice-Bob conversation to further clarify why I asked you for evidence:


**Alice:** I have found a bunch of cases where Eve was behaving maliciously, and here is documented proof of her doing so. Despite me having admin privileges and the ability to access all of Carol's logs, I have been unable to find any evidence of Carol behaving maliciously like this.


**Bob:** How do I validate that you've done an objective due diligence with checking Carol's Logs? You didn't provide me with any means necessary to check them, while Eve's logs is open for everybody to see.

I would just say, either pick more up now, or hold long. I personally still think ETH will flip BTC, but it won't happen until the next wave of new money (since their entrance is BTC).

I think the reason he doesn’t say it is because he is afraid it will ruin his reputation or that he has some sort of deal with him. 

If he really cared about Bitcoin he should tell everyone he is a fraud and is not to be trusted. That way maybe we could expell both this scammer and his company nChain from the community and give Bitcoin Cash more legitimacy.

&gt; 5. ""Why Bitcoin is Better than Gold"" --&gt; ~I actually agree Bitcoin is better than gold as an SoV both individually and socially; I harp on bitcoin PoW mining wrecking the environment a lot, but gold is worse. ~

Yup, we oversell crypto and hype up crypto:

&gt; 10. ""Bitcoin is a really big shift on par with the internet and the internal combustion engine""; --&gt; ~even if you replace ""bitcoin"" with ""cryptoeconomics in general"", I don't think it's fair to go quite that far. The tech is important, but imo better not to oversell it.~

As someone who has used LN in testNet and mainNet, I think this is currently true but if LN UI / ease of use increases/succeeds, it'll help increase the Bitcoin network effect.  But this is certainly a period of opportunity for a crypto like `Nano`:

&gt; 45. ""It's easier to migrate from bitcoin core to altcoins than to migrate from bitcoin core to lightning"" --&gt; ~this is actually a very interesting point: lightning only benefits from bitcoin's *currency* network effect, NOT *tech/development* network effect~

Also a good point:

&gt; 47. Samson: ""If you're accepting payments in altcoins, there's very little liquidity"" --&gt; ~IMO not true since ~2015 for the top ~10-50 coins. Just use the altcoins as a payment channel; when your balance gets to ~$100 convert to bitcoin through shapeshift and sell to fiat from there~",1522764982
"Ronpaulfan69 said it best, so I'm quoting him below.

The 5.1% increase of bitcoin represents an increase in the total supply.

The Fed's inflation goal of 3% represents the increase in the price of goods and services included in the CPI, as denominated in USD.

They're two different things.

The best comparison to the 5.1% bitcoin increase, is probably the M2, which went from $13.37 trillion to $13.9 trillion over the last 12 months, which is about a 3.9% increase, so less than the percentage increase in bitcoin.

I'm sure they're great people and it honestly sucks big time to lose the amount of money that people did, some friends of mine got hit pretty hard, but selling now, at the depths of despair just indicates a lack of proper financial judgement to me.

"I panic sold back in Sept during the China ban fud. Used the money for projects around the house... Started buying again in October and it took me months to get back my .5 BTC. Told myself I'd always hodl. I had lost half my stack from panic selling. 

Then we hit 19k, profits were big. Between BTC and alt-coins, profits were up for me more than 100% and that was just from starting at the end of October from scratch. 
I watched as my profits dwindled.. oh well didn't care. 8k ""profit"" down the drain.. oh well, hodl I said. 

Then I got to my break-even point by Jan 31st. Once I was below break-even, shit got real. I didn't care about losing the 8k in profit nearly as much as losing 2k of my hard earned money. 

We drop to $6,600 and I start to think.. ""What if this goes to 4k? I can sell now and buy lower..."" so like you, I sold at $6,600 but back on Feb 5th. 

It did go lower, all the way to $5800 but I didn't put in any limit buy orders. I took a nap, and by the time I woke up, It was at $7200... damnit. 

""Maybe it will come back down.."" So I waited... and then FOMOed back in a day later @ $8200. I lost .1 BTC in the process. (which is a lot for me). 

So, if I had just Hodled, I'd have nearly double the Bitcoin I  currently have and even in this bear market, I'd still be up. 

So, even if we drop to 3-4k again, I'll just DCA and lower my overall BTC price. Hopefully burning my hand twice is enough of a lesson to learn. ",1522764704

"Nano is a coin that could actually become THE defacto world currency. Long shot? Absolutely. But if there's a coin that could actually take #1 from bitcoin, right now my money is on Nano. 

Nano hit $30ish at it's height, and it was still a relatively unknown coin at the time. It was given away in an airdrop, so because people didn't pay to acquire it (at first), there was substantial downward pressure on people selling it and taking free money.

As time goes by, and Nano develops further uses, knocks out roadmap milestones, etc, and more usecases and adoption is done, more people will wake up to how amazing this coin is. My whole family (roughly 100 people) already use Nano to trade for grocery money, etc. I.e. my mom picks up a bunch of eggs on sale, everyone tosses her some Nano. It's SO much easier than cash. Instant, free.

Once people realize how amazing Nano is (do one thing and do it REALLY WELL), this coin could literally become #1 ranked crypto. 

It's $5.75 right now. If it only goes as high as LTC (which is trying to do the same thing, only using outdated old technology), it would be $53. That's at todays depressed market values.

If we EVER get back to the ATHs, then you are looking at $150-200 Nano.

I don't know about you, but longterm, I think we pass 800B market cap. I think we go towards 3-5T in a few years. That's like $1000 Nano.

Pretty good buy at under $6 today.

If you don't have even a few hundred bucks of Nano, I don't know what to say. It could disappear, but it could also hit $10,000 one day (and that's not even that unreasonable of a market cap. (Which would be a 1.3T market cap). Those numbers sound insane, but that's putting it around Amazon or apple market cap. Definitely a long shot, but if Nano succeeds in doing what it's trying to do  (and it's already REALLY amazing so far, just use it and see), then having a market cap the size of amazon is probably really conservative.

Again, I'm not talking next month or even next year... but in 10 years or more? It's certainly not impossible.

$1000 now could be almost 2 million if that ever happened. That's enough to retire instantly on. And yes, it very likely won't happen. But it may.

&gt; he could be even the son of pol pot but the point is i have the f***ing right to defend him and his opinions if i choose so. and being censored by a community who blatantly supports free speech tells volumes about the hypocrisy in BCH propaganda.

Hard to say without reference to exactly what happened, perhaps someone said something as simple as ""Luke-jr thinks slavery is moral"" and you sperged out and threatened to kill them for slander or something equally ridiculous? Since you're not referencing what actually happens, it's difficult to say. I am curious though and would appreciate said reference though for what it's worth though, as I am indeed a free speech absolutist and in my experience this forum simply doesn't censor except in case of spam etc, and has the public modlogs to prove it, so the particular details of your claimed affront would be useful.

&gt; so if you were attacked would you not fight back? as for me i'm sorry but i'm not a glutton for punishment

You weren't attacked though, is exactly the point. You point out you were angry about something which actually there was plenty of good reason for, and in retrospect looks like quite a good choice, that's what I meant by ""your emotional problems"". I'd like to think if I were on the other side of the fence, yes, I could see that and realise I was wrong and learn from it.

"The 5.1% increase of bitcoin represents an increase in the total supply.

The Fed's inflation goal of 3% represents the increase in the price of goods and services included in the CPI, as denominated in USD.

They're two different things.

The best comparison to the 5.1% bitcoin increase, is probably the M2, which went from $13.37 trillion to $13.9 trillion over the last 12 months, which is about a 3.9% increase, so less than the percentage increase in bitcoin.

"Ride the BTC wave, as it should be the entry point to new money. But very shortly after alts start to rise more than BTC on any given day, you want to be where you just mentioned.

I also think ETH will be an insanely profitable, because it crashed so hard, and is still just as valuable as it ever was. There's been a lot of downwards pressure on dying ICOs selling off ETH - which is a good lesson to learn from any platform play which uses it's currency to pay for ICOs. Once all the shit ICO die off and try to harvest as much cash before they die, the platform coin may die back a bit just from all the downward pressure. This is especially true if there are LOTS of really BAD ICOs. 

That downward pressure on ETH should be done soon, and it's likely going to rebound harder than BTC.

Look at 2016-2017, BTC went 17x and ETH went almost 100x. I think the same thing will happen in 2018-2019... BTC will rebound but ETH will be better.

Then, other super undervalued coins like NANO, NEO, OMG, VEN, WAN, ICX, etc, they could be even better plays than ETH longterm.

Just look at something like Nano. That could either stagnate and slowly die, or it could become a #2 or #3 ranked coin, or even take over BTC one day (I'm talking like 5-10 years). The growth potential for some of these coins is INSANE.

I mean, look at OMG... they seek to be the backbone of every blockchain transaction, not just currency, but new drivers license applications, real estate transactions, etc. It's a massively big goal, but they have a decent chance of doing it. They've also been working on plasma for 2 years before their ICO, and are MILES ahead of anyone else from implementing it. If they are first to the market with plasma, OMG will skyrocket, along with ETH. Add to that POS dividends, and OMG could also be the biggest play of 2018.

"All this people complaining that Vitalik asked why he was allowed in the conference. Well, my 2 sats:

1 - on one hand, if you have people actively developing and investing in crypto, seems that it is enough and so Vitalik looks like he is being a dick, if they have sansung mow, why not CSW? No difference;

2 - but, on the other hand, I don't think Vitalik is being a dick, because this is a special case: if the person gathers attention, fame, etc, based on something that is NOT public proof, then it feels pretty illegitimate and it is not healthy for crypto as a whole; we (and I'm including every single ""crypto"" listed in CMC+the whole ecosystem) are plagued with scams, this whole party is going to get over soon like that and CSW not signing the freaking genesis block, or any of the known satoshi addresses, and at the same time gathering publicity with a bogus proof behind him, is just fucking bad for everybody, it looks like a scam.

Now, I do think CSW has some interesting things said/wirtten, I think he is a guy committed to help, investing and funding development for BCH (and not a scammer because he didn't scam anyone), and I do think there is a chance he is satoshi, but good god, sign the fucking keys or stop being so butt hurt with people pointing the incoherence, because, ""as is"", looks bad AF. Sorry, Vitalik just said what 99% of people feel, ""gosh, sign the freaking keys and/or quit the publicity"".

"&gt; It wasn't meant to ""prove"" anything in particular, but rather, to begin a cooperative process of mathematical formulation.

Yes, I've got this now. 

&gt; I think the concept of ""fair share"" is distorted by an implicit assumption that mining difficulty adjustments will make an increase in relative on-chain block proportions equal to an increase in profit in the long run.

I agree that this is a huge consideration, and I've actually been updating my simulation to test this. I'm simulating how revenue per time period compares with honest mining with both BTC and BCH difficulty adjustments. It's pretty interesting so far. For example, with BTC's adjustment, with 40% hashpower, and assuming they start at the beginning of a new difficulty period, it would take approximately 30 days for SM to become **profitable** (ie - their expected revenue is *absolutely* greater than if they were honest). At 35%, it would take approximately 75 days (on average, of course; I've yet to figure out the distribution).

I'm still working on the BCH version, but my initial results show that at higher values (&gt; 42%), SMs are *profitable* within a single *day*! I think that's an interesting result. 

&gt; Once a difficulty of a particular value is reached, it will be more profitable to then resume mining honestly. I haven't reasoned out every edge case here, but if difficult adjustments are included in the model, I think it is worth considering strategies where secret miners completely stop mining for an epoch and then begin rapidly mining for another epoch.

This is an interesting strategy, and I may investigate this myself.

I think the piece you are missing is that the app needs to always scan any HD address chain that is has ever supported, and that scanning for our app is somewhat slow because the app connects directly to the bitcoin network, vs a server we control and monitor - this I think is an often overlooked privacy benefit over other wallets. You don’t have to trust us not to turn over your tx history to the government because we don’t have access to it in the first place.  
  
What I mean is that version 1 (😉) of bitcoin uses the regular 1abc... format. So no matter what formats we support in the future, BRD will still need to scan those early addresses to see if they have funds in them. Otherwise, hodlers who try to find their coins in 5 years or whatever will be pissed. We could implement P2SH addresses pretty easily, but we’ve decided to take some heat in the short term to leapfrog to Bech32. That way, the app won’t get slowed down by checking P2SH addresses for eternity. It will only have to check 2 chains. This is the honest truth - I don’t really care what the conspiracy theories say. You’re getting this from the horse’s mouth and I don’t think there is a
better source than that. ",1522762787
"I don’t care how it is performing at this stage, as that’s how am i plan to win those believers’ money.  More believers = more money, so l hope it is even better now.

"What are you even getting at? Vitalik never claimed to be Satoshi, while failing at the necessary proofs and offering endless excuses and prevarications. Wright's been making a fool of himself or worse for a long time. It's astonishing there are people naive enough to give him any credence at this point.

Wright is a great source for humor (watching him get the concept of velocity of money totally backwards gave me giggles), but he should probably be in jail for tax fraud, not running around making a fool of himself and anyone dumb enough to associate with him.

"&gt;I would have liked had he worked with Bitcoin

Whether or not anyone chooses to contribute to Bitcoin development is up to them. There isn't an obvious ""money-grab"" opportunity when it comes to just rolling up your sleeves and writing code (or offering peer review, or testing, or documentation, or any other type of technical contribution) for Bitcoin, though... so the most obvious explanation here is that Vitalik was more interested in the rewards for launching (not to mention governing) an altcoin than he was in helping with Bitcoin protocol development.

He wrote some (fairly simple) Bitcoin-oriented Python tools and a minimal library, but that's all he ever tried to do in this department. His choice to do an ICO (and from then on to actively deride Bitcoin whenever he got the chance in what seems to be an underhanded effort at promoting his own platform) is lamentable, but speaks more to his quality-of-character (or lack thereof) than anything else.

Also, just for the record and while we're on the subject, Satoshi pretty much said ""Let's *not* try and turn Bitcoin into something generalized like Ethereum, because that [doesn't scale](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1790.msg28917#msg28917), and we can always do cross-chain atomic swaps if we really need to."" So the whole idea of ""making Bitcoin into an Ethereum-like protocol"" was shot down by Satoshi years before Vitalik even started paying attention... if he wanted to pursue building such a network, that's his right, but let's not pretend like ""if we were nicer, we could have prevented Ethereum from existing"" (or even like that would be a desirable outcome). Ethereum has a lot of warts that we're lucky Bitcoin does not suffer from (though it certainly has its own).

&gt;Cobra has been labeled a traitor.

Cobra is a purely-pseudonymous actor in the space who inexplicably was handed (effectively) ""final say"" over the content of bitcoin.org, which has served as the ""de facto official Bitcoin site"" since the beginning of the project. At least some of his accounts were compromised a while back, and we have no way of knowing whether control was ever regained by the ""original Cobra"" (or even who that is, or what their qualifications are). The current controller of (at least some) of Cobra's social accounts seems to enjoy attention and stirring up drama, and many people are uncomfortable with the seeming influence that such a divisive entity might theoretically destructively wield if they were so inclined, especially because we have no proof (or even evidence) that the account(s) haven't fallen into ""the wrong hands"" (as they did before, and where they very conceivably could have remained). Cobra is not responsible (as far as we know) for the creation or launch of any altcoins, though, so once again, your ""I wonder how many altcoins we can breed"" statement doesn't really make any sense in this context, and it looks more like you're trolling than like you're trying to contribute something meaningful here.",1522762742

2) ETH is an illegal security according to the Howey test with a premine of 72 million eths

3) Vitalik and many other have been falsely representing Ethereum and misleading others over and over again. example - pitching turing completeness as the valuable aspect of ETh , now pivoting away from that and saying it was never about turing completeness but ""rich statefulness""

4) Ethereum is a pointless project that will lead to no efficiency because there is no censorship risk in code execution. If a project has no hope of ever creating an efficiency(like bitcoin has found with regulatory arbitrage) than every company and project will ultimately fail in its ecosystem. Are you trying to suggest that someday in the future there will be censorship risk in code execution? If not than what purpose does Ethereum solve if it comes with a horrible tradeoff of an extremely large attack surface and huge scaling problems?

5) For goodness sake the inflation distribution rate or final algo is not even defined and people are investing in this. This is insane and basically amounts to faith in vitalik and his team, while at the same time newbs are misled into believing eth is decentralized.

"**Fashionable Nonsense**

Fashionable Nonsense: Postmodern Intellectuals' Abuse of Science (French: Impostures Intellectuelles), published in the UK as Intellectual Impostures, is a book by physicists Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont. Sokal is best known for the Sokal Affair, in which he submitted a deliberately absurd article to Social Text, a critical theory journal, and was able to get it published.

The book was published in French in 1997, and in English in 1998; the English editions were revised for greater relevance to debates in the English-speaking world. As part of the so-called science wars, Sokal and Bricmont criticized postmodernism in academia for what they considered misuses of scientific and mathematical concepts in postmodern writing.

**Bogdanov affair**

The Bogdanov affair is an academic dispute regarding the legitimacy of a series of theoretical physics papers written by French twins Igor and Grichka Bogdanov (alternately spelt Bogdanoff). These papers were published in reputable scientific journals, and were alleged by their authors to culminate in a proposed theory for describing what occurred at the Big Bang.

The controversy began in 2002 when Max Niedermaier, a physicist at the University of Tours, emailed Ted Newman, a physicist at the University of Pittsburgh, alleging that the twins—who had previously had celebrity status for a science fiction television program in France—had spoofed their PhD theses. Rumors spread on Usenet newsgroups that the work was a deliberate hoax intended to target weaknesses in the peer review system employed by the physics community to select papers for publication in academic journals.

"To be more accurate, if the price decreases, then the percentage of newly-mined coins that miners choose to sell will *increase*. Miners have to pay their bills. They can't decide to just not pay their power bill or their employees this month because BTC is low.

Take me, for example. I run [an industrial-scale mining facility](http://toom.im) with a $40,000/month power bill. I choose to liquidate only enough crypto each month to pay for electricity, rent, capital expenses, and labor. Let's say $64k/month total. When BTC is at $8,000, that would be 8 BTC. If BTC were to fall to $4,000, we would still liquidate $64k/month, but it would be 16 BTC instead.

While that is my liquidation strategy, other miners are different. Many miners have a liquidate-100%-immediately strategy. When they mine a block, the immediately liquidate it for fiat.

There has never in the history of crypto been a year of normal, slight upwards, consistent behavior, it has always been a wild ride, since inception.

"Seriously, how are people so foolish? One of the biggest flaws in PoW is that you can control the network if you have a high enough hashrate. Supposedly, the ""fact"" that it would cost too much money to produce 51% of the hashrate on Bitcoin is supposed to protect the network forever. However, what happens if some new incredible computing device is designed and it's design is kept secret from others for a few years? 

For examples sake, let's say that the US government creates a super quantum miner that can produce a hashrate of 1 EH/s and it can be produced and an economically viable price. All it would take is the NSA running that miner for a few months or years to completely kill Bitcoin. What could a PoW coin do to protect itself from a 51% attack when the attack is cost effective for an attacker? I don't really see options besides maybe forking to a new chain, but then that chain would just become the target of the 51% later on. 

Personally, I think a PoS consensus mechanism could potentially be the final solution to a 51% attack. Because you have to first buy half the coins on the market which could get incredibly expensive and so the majority of the former coin holders who you bought from would now have lots of capital. If you then decided to 51% attack the network you would in effect just be burning down the house you just bought for a premium price.The network would be dead, but the majority believers in the coin would be fine.",1522761215

"&gt;Vitalik said something that no one is ever mentioning: how can you move around 1000 satoshi? That's impossible with BTC.

That's false for a number of reasons. You can move 1000 satoshis with Bitcoin just fine. One example of how to do so is via batching a number of conceptual transactions or payments together into a single network/Bitcoin transaction, and having that be confirmed on-chain (rather than having each individual constituent transaction submitted separately). With signature aggregation techniques like Schnorr, this gets even more powerful and has an even more profound impact on what's possible and viable.

But we can do *better*. We can set up payment channels to get our fees much, much lower.

With regards to the Lightning Network, which is probably the most economically viable decentralized micropayments platform yet conceived, after opening a payment channel, you are able to amortize the fees for doing so over an arbitrary-length chain of transactions, reducing the per-transaction fee to *a few satoshis* or even *less than a satoshi per payment*. The Lightning Network is operational on mainnet *today*, so these sorts of things are a reality (though the software is still being avidly tested and should only be considered in the ""early beta"" stage right now).

What Vitalik voiced as a criticism of the Lightning Network was the following (which is also wrong):

&gt;[I don't think it's possible to spend less than ~10000 satoshis. Sure, you can use lightning channels, but entering a channel itself costs that amount, so you can't collect a payment *for the first time* if it's smaller](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/981073361714364417?s=20) 

The reason this is incorrect is because payment channels can be unilaterally funded. Vitalik doesn't seem aware of this fact, which means that what he said here is actually just a misunderstanding on his part.",1522761075
"Do you mean all the credit payment companies combined? Because that is not a fair comparison, stellar is a minuscule company in terms of size compared to VISA for example. If stellar had the same resources like a big payment processor company I’m sure their technology will propel even further. Also traditional data processing for payments are not distributed at all, all these companies have internal ledgers and they are really not the same class of database as DLT or the SCP(if you can even call DLT a “database”). In the crypto space Stellar is the current leader in terms of scalability and interoperability. ",1522761053

"Haha, yeah sometimes faith is stupid after all. Well, we will see. It's not my biggest investment, so it won't hurt too much.  
What worries me much more is that most business is in the hand of a few exchanges. This is even more risky for any coin and the whole crypto economy to grow. If one of the major exchanges exit scams, gets severly hacked, shut down by a government, has some serious system error or whatever, it will affect anyone. And then, we have the potential for market manipulation. That can be done easier with only a few big players than in a completely decentralized economy.

There are a lot of ways to screw up, so tread carefully and dont let emotions get the better of you.
Decide if you are a trader or an investor.  Im not a trader, its far too risky, these markets are uncontrolled and move wildly.  Investing still carries risk, but you can just ride a general uptrend rather than trying to guess every market move.

Also look at ways you can earn crypto, if you buy a PoS coin you can earn more crypto by 'staking' it.  Some coins reward behaviours like doing scientific research (Gridcoin) generating Solar Energy (SolarCoin).  Steemit is a way to blog/vlog and get paid for it with crypto.  So you see its not just about risking your money, for the savvy, there are methods to risk almost nothing.

"&gt; My card just takes money from my bank account directly

As will your Lightning channels be refilled from your on-chain wallets automatically (if configured). So, basically indisquitishable for users in this regard.

&gt; The debit card system is far more convenient than Bitcoin is unfortunately, even with LN.

Definitively. I am not arguing that, requiring private keys and seeds and ""oh if you fuck up you'll lose your money"" is horrible UX.

&gt; Bitcoins strength is large settlement payments, to replace bank wires. 

I mean, Bitcoin already does replace bank wires in my genuine opinion, assuming both parties are willing to accept it. Its instability is an issue, but excluding that Bitcoin beats wire transfers out of the water.

I do believe another of Bitcoin's legitimate use cases is as an additional payment scheme to credit/debit cards. Not replacing them, but if both the company and the user wishes to, accepting Lightning payments. It reduces fees and negates chargebacks.

&gt;Those suck. You already know that though.

Don't remind me, I've only ever had to do two international bank transfers (one SEPA and one wire), both made me squirm with how awkward it all was. Even large national payments are awkward (I had a bank call me on three separate days to confirm I still wanted to do the transaction, and had the payment delayed by a week). I understand it's in the name of ""security"", but it hurt.

I want to see a future with programmable money (and I don't mean APIs, as some banks already offer APIs, I'm talking smart contracts).

You just don't wanna hear bad truths about bitcoin I understand,1522759370
"The DAO hack happened to ETH, which was and still is PoW.  As you can see, there are plenty of reasons to roll back PoW too.  When there is such a critical failure, sometimes the resolution requires drastic steps.   Another example of a drastic step is Krypton coin responding to their 51% attack by switching from PoW to PoS

Having majority supply compromised on any coin will always be a grave concern.  Have a look at the nano theft or ongoing mt gox situation, neither of which have majority ownership, but will remain looming spectres into the future that could cause market manipulation, spam attacks, and other issues.

The scenarios in the second article also compromise PoW.  (and the 3rd is the same as your first link)  No crypto can currently survive segmentation without forking issues.  If coins are forked past their reorg depth, it is unlikely the chain would be rolled back that far, so even though PoW may be able to determine the ""winning"" chain more easily it is unlikely to help in that scenario.  It's more likely that both forks would survive and we'd have Coincoin and Egyption CoinCoin (as an example of someone isolating their internet)",1522759359
"It facilitates adoption, though.  Imagine a merchant begins accepting BTC through one of these services.  Some time passes and one of the vendors they purchase supplies from also begins accepting BTC through a similar service.

The merchant now has the option to begin accepting BTC directly, instead of having it immediately converted to Fiat, then use that BTC to pay this upstream vendor.  Repeat this process up the entire supply chain and suddenly that supply chain no longer needs Fiat to operate.

In this fashion, these payment services facilitate the adoption of BTC by enabling different people or merchants at different points in the system to begin using BTC as if the entire system had already adopted it.

This is definitely real adoption.  It does not matter to the buyer what the seller does with the currency after the transaction is complete.  If I sell something to you, and immediately convert the USD you gave me into Gold, Euros, or Pizza, it does not matter to you at all.

(Gold = invests it, Euro = turn it into another currency, Pizza = purchase something with it)",1522759339

While that is technically true, there are some practical limitations. If it were discovered that they cheated the network, the entire supply of tokens would immediately become near worthless and all the money they invested to get the 51% attack would be wasted.

"&gt;Well, then you have to think about whether you want to support decentralized currencies to begin with, because those currencies, like Monero, advocate strongly that everyone can do as they please.

You might need to do some actual thinking yourself. I don't need to rethink support because I think everyone *should* do as they please. What I please to do is to oppose those I see as scum. 

So we're all good.

No need. Not worked up. Ponder my first statement above.

"**Gambler's fallacy**

The gambler's fallacy, also known as the Monte Carlo fallacy or the fallacy of the maturity of chances, is the mistaken belief that, if something happens more frequently than normal during a given period, it will happen less frequently in the future. It may also be stated as the belief that, if something happens less frequently than normal during a given period, it will happen more frequently in the future. In situations where the outcome being observed is truly random and consists of independent trials of a random process, this belief is false. The fallacy can arise in many situations, but is most strongly associated with gambling, where it is common among players.

"Um... your data kinda sucks. I'm in the USA, and I pay $0.03/kWh. That's about 1/7th of what your chart for the USA shows. Mining mostly happens in the cheapest regions in a country, not the most expensive. I promise you that mining in the USA happens at less than $0.05/kWh happens at above $0.05/kWh. Almost none of it happens at $0.21/kWh as stated in your chart.

That criticism aside, there's another issue:

&gt; This picture could be used as an indicator for the lowest price of BTC, BCH and LTC.

No, that's not true. When mining stops being profitable for miners, then some of them stop mining. That causes the mining difficulty to drop, which makes the profitability increase for everyone else. The total supply of freshly mined coins *does not change*. Miners will continue to dump coins on the market at roughly the same rate (e.g. 12.5 BTC/10 minutes) regardless of the price of those coins. There is no price floor for cryptocurrencies based on mining revenue.",1522758918

1. Rich investors/Institutional buyers and whales
2. People who are tethered (Tether has a $2.3B market cap right now, so lots of money is tethered)
3. Average Joe who will do what he sees and reads.

People in 1. are the smartest and control the market right now. They are the ones who are doing the pump and dump now and hence the sideways movement. They also have the most patience and knowledge about the market. We don't seem to be getting any new money from them. Just pumps followed by dumps.

People in 2. are also not looking interested. Market cap of tether seems to be at the same spot.

Coming to 3. Average joe will mostly just FOMO or follow TAs and other info available online if he wants to invest wisely (not that that info will be 100% correct)

People in 2. believe that 6k is what BTC will come to, most TAs believe that. People in 1. will try to buy it as cheap as possible because they are patient and know market sentiments. In such a case how will this market continue to rise from here seems questionable? There is a reason we have been falling down and down. 2 weeks back I wasn't even thinking about 7k. Most people were thinking about 9k and above. Even earlier we were not thinking 8k and wanted to go past 9k. This trend stopping just for no reason seems unlikely to me.

Up until this point nothing wrong with hyping other than previously lost trust in false promises. Thus, nothing wrong but be cautious. 

3. Here is where the article (and/or the source of these claims) fuck up. Speculating a top 3 position and a price target of 1$. Absolutely rediculous assumptions based on nothing but a unannounced partnership. This renders the whole article invalid and will only get naive people to invest.

"Fair enough, I see your confusion, I will try and explain. I do admit that it is a downside and I can't rebrand it as a ""feature"", but maybe I can explain why it occurs and give you a ""real world"" example of it:

Imagine that your on-chain wallet is your large purchase account and your lightning wallet is your micropayment account. Sort of similar to a bank account and a credit card. Bank accounts you can do very large payments but they take a little while to do so (~10 minutes to 72 hours, depending on the amount of money).

Credit cards, on the other hand, are almost immediate (for validation, clearing takes longer but we'll ignore that for this demonstration).

You rarely go into a shop and pay for your coffee via bank transfer, because it's inconvenient, but you do go into a shop and pay for your coffee with card, and then pay off your card with a bank transfer. That will be similar to how Lightning will work:

If you have money in your on chain wallet (I.E. bank account), and it's a large transaction, you probably will be happy waiting 10 minutes or so for a confirmation to validate that it succeeded. Examples of this would be when you'd use your bank account to buy something IRL, like maybe large purchases from retailers (£5k+).

If you have money in lightning payment channels (I.E. Credit cards), and it's a small transaction, you probably will want to route the payment A.S.A.P. so you can continue on with your day (like a coffee, for example).

Obviously, Lightning isn't a form of credit so you can't ""borrow"" money and pay it back at the end of each month from your on-chain wallet, so you will need to prepay. In this example, you may choose to allocate 20% of your available wallet into these payment channels. As long as you don't want to spend more than the 20% of your money in payment channels before you refill it, or as long as you don't want to spend more than the 80% of your money on chain before you withdraw some money from payment channels, then you're golden.

If you do, then, yes, unfortunately, you will have to wait a little while (though as long as everyone is cooperating, it should only be the length of 1 on-chain transaction to get 3 confirmations to deposit, no confirmations to withdraw (as you can spend an unconfirmed transaction, it just will delay the latter transaction until the prior is confirmed))

Is it great? No. Is it workable? Yeah. I'm going to defend it a little and say, I rarely spend 20% of the value I have in BTC in one day on small purchases, or 80% of the value I have in BTC in one day on large purchases. I think it's a perfectly acceptable system and can't criticize too much.",1522756442
"&gt; ""SegWit integration presents some unique challenges for Bread. Unlike custodial services or server-trusting bitcoin apps, Bread connects directly to the bitcoin peer-to-peer network, using simplified payment verification, or SPV. This means Bread users are not reliant on us or our services in order to access their funds. Even if our entire business shuts down tomorrow, users would still have full control over their bitcoin balances.""

&gt; ""One aspect of the SPV protocol is that each time a new type of bitcoin address or signature scheme is introduced, a new chain of addresses must be monitored for transactions belonging to the user. This monitoring is resource intensive, particularly on mobile devices, and introduces long delays during app ""syncing."" To provide our users with the best experience possible, we have commited to aggressively pursuing an implementation of SegWit that is sufficiently mature as to not become obsolete in the foreseeable future.

Until you were fooled into cheering for the sabotaged version and hating the original version instead, due to your extremely perverted vision of what actually happened. 

&gt; then jihad and roger stalled segwit for 9 months. and we were compelled to uasf to get it. this angered me.

Segwit flatly couldn't get actual signalling for activation, period. The only way it got in was bait and switch with hka, nya and segwit2x. And now it's actually there were the scaling problems fixed at all? No. Lightning and segwit are both turning out exactly as the skeptics warned they would.

Luke-jr is probably the single most toxic person in the entire cryptocurrency world, other than perhaps one or two other people that spring to mind. That being the case, you should consider the possibility your defence of him was actually flatly wrong. For example, someone may have pointed out he believed slavery was moral, and you may have responded with the outrage one would assume if you were not aware that was actually true, and that outrage coupled with the fact you were denying a flat out truth may have made it look to a neutral observer that you were just another troll.

Why do we all assume that *another* bullrun is inevitable? Why are down 75%, but people are still somewhat optimistic about things? You don't see people ""buying the dip"" when blood is everywhere, that's a Crypto thing/mentality. 


Why is it? Because I believe that this shit is the future. A decentralized currency is ground-brekaing revolution. The tech, at least Bitcoin, is secure and decentral - no other currencies has these attributes attached to them. That's why I think another bullrun is inevitable. That's why it has always been inevitable for the last 9 years and it's why I think it will continue to rally like it has ( past performance ), it's because the truth is Bitcoin/Altcoin is better than normal money. 


That's why I put my money in. Because I don't want to live in a world, where cash is destroyed and replaced with book money, which tracks every move you make.

After you've read these comments, I recommend taking a step back and realizing that the whataboutism actually started *one level up* in the thread; *as I explicitly predicted*, rather than acknowledging the facts that I have presented, users are trying desperately to change the subject to discuss *mod logs of a different subreddit*.

**Not only** did this make my earlier prediction come true *to the letter*, but it demonstrates a deeper point that I have been making (here, in the two linked comments I just provided, and in a dozen basically-identical threads where this same predictable pattern has played out time and time again): apparently, **no one here is willing to take an honest look at the mod logs that they do have access to**, which speaks absolute *volumes* about the intent behind the incessant demands I keep receiving (despite the fact that these demands are invariably perfect examples of whataboutism that I directly predict, *in advance*, in the very threads in which they occur).

So, you asking the question ""What does the above have to do with what is being discussed?"" **is exactly my point** (or at least one big component thereof). The mod logs of /r/Bitcoin *aren't* relevant to what I was pointing out (and giving proof of)! Not even slightly! So when the (rather transparent) attempt to change the subject is made, and an unreasonable, almost carte blanche demand for unrelated logs is made by an obviously agenda-driven entity (with apparent malicious intent), it should make alarm bells go off in any intelligent observer's head.

That should be plenty of evidence. As you can see, the claims that I have made are all true. Now, since I've granted your request and answered your questions while you try to avoid mine, I believe it is time for some reciprocation. 

1) Do you realize that my initial contribution to this thread was factually true, and that I later proved it so by linking to direct corroboration of the claims therein?

2) Do you realize that I also *explicitly predicted* the whataboutism that you (and many others) are currently trying to perform, by changing the subject to that of the moderation policies/activity of a subreddit other than this one?

3) Do you understand the exchange between Alice and Bob (included in my previous comment as well as this one), and how appropriately it parallels our own conversation?

**Alice:** I have found a bunch of cases where Eve was behaving maliciously, and here is documented proof of her doing so. Despite me having admin privileges and the ability to access all of Carol's logs, I have been unable to find any evidence of Carol behaving maliciously like this.

**Bob:** Where is your evidence of having conducted a cross analysis?

**Alice:** Uh, I just gave it to you.

**Bob:** I am asking you for your evidence. Quit dodging the question.

1: Segwit was one year delayed because some miners blocked to exploit Asic Boost, all the great tech that start to roll out now could be around for a year already.
1: The crash in BTC price around (I think) october last year from 7500 to 5500 was purely because of an attack where the cancellation of 2X, spam on the BTC network, a tsunami of sock puppet shilling on (social) media and a FREAKING FLAW in BCH (EDA) were misused to steel the BTC hashpower. This was done through manipulation and a FLAW, not by free market forces!
3: Bcash proponents been spamming the network for ages and exchanges refused to implement SEGWIT and do batching what today totally cleared up the network.

basically what you're unconsciously doing is the motte and bailey tactic, you're moving the ""random point in time"" from -10 to 0 when the SM finds (and HIDES) a block

this is from the ""human observer"" view (its we call a **false positive**, it's correct when discussing bitcoin, but it can't be ""applied"" to bitcoin (see your ""but in reality"" words), you understand but you've confused yourself, many have), the honest miner doesn't give a shit, he's still working from -10, therefore its +5

plenty more people understand now, just finishing building the tools to help them and others also understand

you can already see the cracks, just like you did when people started to get a clue about Blockstream

"&gt; What about when deep bit at 50% of the mining power? Nothing happened.

The argument that a risky situation occurred and nothing happened is not an argument. I could cross the road with my eyes closed a dozen times without getting knocked down. That wouldn’t mean it was a safe or sensible thing to do.

&gt; I don't think you understand how pools work. Individual miners send their hashing power to pools.

This is the same thing I already told you is nonsense. Most pools, especially the Chinese ones, control large datacenter mining operations. They run a public pool in part so they can mask the amount of hashpower they directly control. Everyone in Bitcoin knows about this right up until the point where it doesn’t fit their narrative. Then suddenly we’re back to having thousands of people with rigs set up in their garages.

&gt; The difference is that Bitmain isn't trying to cripple bitcoin.

Even if I accepts that bitfury wants to cripple their cash-cow, that doesn’t explain why you pretended that they are they only big centralised mining operation. It doesn’t matter whether you consider bitmain or ViaBTC to be benevolent or not, they are *potential* points of failure for someone looking to attack the network.

"Read more about the relationship [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/81xuth/how_bitcoin_core_btc_rbitcoin_extreme_censorship/dv6e5u1) and [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/83byqw/definitive_proof_that_rbtc_doesnt_engage_in/dvj4iai).

After you've read these comments, I recommend taking a step back and realizing that the whataboutism actually started *one level up* in the thread; *as I explicitly predicted*, rather than acknowledging the facts that I have presented, users are trying desperately to change the subject to discuss *mod logs of a different subreddit*.

**Not only** did this make my earlier prediction come true *to the letter*, but it demonstrates a deeper point that I have been making (here, in the two linked comments I just provided, and in a dozen basically-identical threads where this same predictable pattern has played out time and time again): apparently, **no one here is willing to take an honest look at the mod logs that they do have access to**, which speaks absolute *volumes* about the intent behind the incessant demands I keep receiving (despite the fact that these demands are invariably perfect examples of whataboutism that I directly predict, *in advance*, in the very threads in which they occur).

So, you asking the question ""What does the above have to do with what is being discussed?"" **is exactly my point** (or at least one big component thereof). The mod logs of /r/Bitcoin *aren't* relevant to what I was pointing out (and giving proof of)! Not even slightly! So when the (rather transparent) attempt to change the subject is made, and an unreasonable, almost carte blanche demand for unrelated logs is made by an obviously agenda-driven entity (with apparent malicious intent), it should make alarm bells go off in any intelligent observer's head.

By asking the question you just asked, you're actually answering it yourself. You just don't realize it.",1522753476

"It is. But if you use a precompiled binary you can't compare the binary to the original source code. Therefore, you can't know whether the binary you installed was compiled from the same codebase available in the code repo.

Software distribution and trust is a whole different rabbit hole.

Even if you compiled the software, can you trust the compiler you used? The tool chain?

The idea is to have control over as many aspects of the software stack as possible. Thereby removing as much trust as is humanly possible.

By using a binary, you're adding layers of trust. There are ways to help identify issues along the way though.

Did the binary come from a reputable server?

Check the route to the server and do due diligence on the server IP, hostname and servers in between.

Did it get modifed in transit?

Compare the signature hash of the downloaded file vs the signature hash presented along with the download (if its presented at all).

Did they compile from the repo?

Compile the code yourself and compare the binaries (sig hash, blob size, hex compare) to see if they match.

Did they use an unmodified compiler?

If above test shows differences, check the differences. Do they look patched in after compilation time? Do they look malicious? Try different compilers until results match and find out if that compiler is known to be compromised.

If you can't find the same compiler, something is amiss.

Did they use untampered with libraries?

Same as above, but rotate libs instead of compiler.

Its a lot of work, and I've only scratched tje surface, but if you want a totally trustless crypto setup where every aspect is known to you, this is necessary.

"Quora since you cant embed images here, and the fact you suggested Investopedia I assumed you didn't mind non-academic sources. Wasnt going to dig into literature to show something trivial.

The situation where you are correct is when an exchange or site shows the price as the last sold price. Then of course, if theres no trades made this will not change. However, what is common is to show the price as some ratio between the buy orders and the sell orders. So hypothetically say average buy orders are at $5k, and sells are at $10k, what an exchange would do is show the price as some ratio between them (i.e. $7.5k, although it doesnt have to be exactly centred, and would likely be weighted by the number of repetitive ""orders"" placed). What you're saying is if we removed all the buy orders, that the price wouldn't shift towards $0, and that it would stay in place. This would be an extremely silly way of dealing with things. Since you were after better sources [here you go](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1912045), a journal article explaining exactly this in the general case.

Some here do seem to be concerned that under-resourced non-mining full clients are actually a tax or a drain on the network as a whole, but I think this concern has not been substantiated on the BTC chain, where any of the multiple instances when large numbers of spoofed, sock-puppet non-mining full clients were spun up should have dragged down the network if this concern was legitimate.",1522750161
"Gold has been regarded as a store of value for thousands of years. It is somewhat rare and also beautiful for jewellery and decoration, and has technological uses.

Jewellery 87.5 

Technology uses 13.7

Investment 50.2

Banks and Institutions 15.2

The demand for use as Jewellery is impressive.

Crypto could fight to compete, but maybe it will take many many years 10s, 100s ... or never.

"No you can't, a pre-segwit block would allow spending the segwit outputs using the pre-segwit rules, meaning the miner could send all that BTC anywhere they want to without signing. That's due to the anyone can spend soft fork kludge that would not have been necessary if segwit was implemented as a proper hard fork. If a
miner were to try to publish a block with such transactions violating the segwit rules, the other miners would have to reject it (even though it's technically legal) or face massive devaluation of BTC due to people losing every satoshi they had stored in segwit outputs and people consequently losing all faith in BTC",1522749905

The Sybil attack in computer security is an attack wherein a reputation system is subverted by forging identities in peer-to-peer networks. It is named after the subject of the book Sybil, a case study of a woman diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder. The name was suggested in or before 2002 by Brian Zill at Microsoft Research. The term pseudospoofing had previously been coined by L. Detweiler on the Cypherpunks mailing list and used in the literature on peer-to-peer systems for the same class of attacks prior to 2002, but this term did not gain as much influence as ""Sybil attack"".

While it likely doesn't matter or even register on the ""regular bitcoin user"" level there is an extreme amount of politics and underhanded efforts going on behind the scenes to position oneself as a key player in what many believe to be the economic system of the future. It's just natural really since only a small piece of the pie now could possibly develop into a multi billion dollar asset in a few years.

Now apply, *even mediocre and conservative* growth rates to the future and you will end up with a price in the millions, in a time frame of 2-4 years. 


2017 we went from 1k to 7k~, discounting the ATH of 20k. If we have something similar in 2018/2019, as we've had similar years prior to 2017 too, with ceven bigger growth rates, it's very easy to come to these conclusions. 


Bitcoin's price for the end of the year is probably 50k+ ballpark area. 2019 it might be 100/200k. The growth has always been there, we're getting bigger and bigger. It just doesn't feel like that right now, because we're in a correction phase still, everybody is unhappy and so forth.

"BCH is not better. It is not ready for a mass scale adoption yet and will collapse under heavy load if somebody seriously starts using it for payments. The current low volume of transactions can be easily handled by BTC, BCH, DOGE or any other cryptocurrency.

As for the future, BTC and BCH are taking very different approaches to scaling:

 # BTC is going to offload the vast majority of transactions to the second layer (the key word is ""Lightning Network"" to find more information). It's kind of like multiple layers of CPU cache are used by modern processors to reduce the strain on DRAM and improve performance.

 # BCH is going to focus on improving on-chain scaling (the key words are ""gigablock network"", ""graphene"" and others). It's kind of like trying to increase the DRAM clock speed, bus width, the number of channels and implement other tricks.

I'm quite happy that both approaches are being worked on. What I'm not happy about is how both camps are badmouthing each other and intentionally spreading FUD.

As for the progress, the Lightning Network is real, it is being deployed and can be already tested. The gigablock network is supposed to exist as a lab test right now, but nobody can try it yet.

The other difference is handling of instant transactions. In the Lightning Network they are instant and cryptographically secure, but each party needs to periodically check the blockchain for fraud attempts. BCH relies on 0-conf for instant transactions, which have an inherent risk of double spend fraud, with some work being done to reduce the risk (but not eliminate it completely). I would say that the difference is more like old magnetic stripe credit cards vs. chip cards. Both can be used in practice, but they have different limitations.",1522745621

"&gt; CONCLUSION
In this paper, we demonstrated that the strategy is flawed and this form of reasoning is detrimental to the
bitcoin protocol. This is because it can seriously degrade the system security if users can arbitrarily tinker
with the existing controls when they do not understand the nature of the system they seek to alter. Bitcoin has
been approximated to a Poisson process. Nonetheless, even in the ideal case without difficult changes or a
hash rate growth, it is better represented using a negative binomial or Erlang distribution. Reacting to the
distribution of a block makes the distribution conditional. The selfish miner acts after the honest miner; thus,
it is no longer an i.i.d. Poisson process.
Bitcoin mining with a constant hash rate is a zero-sum game. Without increasing the hash rate, miners
cannot earn more than the default honest strategy. At best, they can cause all parties to lose revenue. Revenue 
XX:18CRAIG WRIGHT
ACM Trans. Priv. Sec., Vol. XXXX, No. XXXX, Article XXXX. Publication date: XXXX XXXX.
is not profit; however, even in this instance, we demonstrated that the overall rates of revenue are lowered
and therefore no rational, profit-seeking miner would engage in such a strategy. The rational economic actor
will consider not only their instantaneous revenue turnover and the associated profitability of an individual
transaction or block reward, but also the overall system profitability. When reviewing the cost of attacking
the network, a rational actor needs to consider both the cost invested in the network as well as the expected
additional returns.
It is crucial that scientific papers are based on tested empirical evidence. The selfish mining paper
explored a model based on the false idea of how a network is constructed. In a series of follow-up papers, we
will explore the theoretical game aspects of the protocol and conclusively demonstrate that bitcoin is
optimally incentivized. Then, we will analyze and present empirical evidence of the network to demonstrate
that the mesh-based system used by Ittay and Gün (2013) is flawed with the true form of the system being a
semi-complete ring network with a large node. The behavior of the system at &gt;51% hash power and at
varying difficulties3 (both as a static system and under increasing investment) will also be presented. We will
demonstrate that the gamma in the selfish mining strategy can never deviate far from zero and that this aspect
of the selfish mining strategy is also flawed.",1522744140
"Basically they hate it because they were told to hate it, but you must remember that the fork was extremely heated.

On one side you had core saying that they would solve all scaling problems with their lambo-on-the-moon-with-free-blowjobs-solution.

On the other hand you have chinese miners and libertarians such as Roger Ver. It was easy for core to create a narrative where bitmain = asicboost = chinese guberment takeover. Roger Ver = convicted crazy felon that fled USA. 

Core _wants_ to make the problem ""simple"", because then the above reasoning works. If you start  to dig into it, you realize that Roger Ver is nothing compared to the community around bitcoin. And you realize that mining isnt either. If bitmain does one fishy thing to the chain, they'll kill bitcoin (and their golden goose).

"**Crab mentality**

Crab mentality or crabs in a bucket (also barrel, basket or pot), is a way of thinking best described by the phrase ""if I can't have it, neither can you"". The metaphor refers to a bucket of live crabs, some of which could easily escape, but other crabs pull them back down to prevent any from getting out and ensure the group's collective demise.

The analogy in human behavior is claimed to be that members of a group will attempt to reduce the self-confidence of any member who achieves success beyond the others, out of envy, spite, conspiracy, or competitive feelings, to halt their progress.

"Excerpt: The niche of centralized exchanges comes from blending the functions of a stock market and a bank. A centralized exchange is a marketplace for trading or converting assets through a single location or service. In many ways, it is similar to the New York Stock Exchange. Currencies can be traded and shorted, for example; margin trading, stop loss, and lending are also available. Satoshi did not address the stock-market functions of crypto, which he probably did not foresee. In fairness, Satoshi explicitly referred to Bitcoin as a developing and evolving technology, which was in its infancy.

In other ways, centralized exchanges resemble banks. After purchasing crypto from an exchange, many customers choose to leave their coins in an account rather than transfer them to a private wallet on their own hard drive. The reasons vary: convenience, the comforting similarity to a bank, the ease of converting to fiat, quick trading, and discomfort with the technology required to set up a private wallet. Whatever the reason, centralized exchanges become trusted third parties that endanger the wealth and well-being of individuals. Consider one aspect of the problem. Private keys are the crypto. The coins have no physical presence, only algorithmic ones. When an exchange controls the keys, it owns the coins; the customer has nothing more than a promise of access to them upon demand.

"**Ad hominem**

Ad hominem (Latin for ""to the man"" or ""to the person""), short for argumentum ad hominem, is a fallacious argumentative strategy whereby genuine discussion of the topic at hand is avoided by instead attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument, or persons associated with the argument, rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself.

However, its original meaning was an argument ""calculated to appeal to the person addressed more than to impartial reason"".

Fallacious ad hominem reasoning is categorized as an informal fallacy, more precisely as a genetic fallacy, a subcategory of fallacies of irrelevance.

Once Verge got the money the deal moved forward but doesn’t go through until 4/16/18 and it would be very inappropriate to announce a partnership until everything is in the clear. There have been times where a crypto announced a partnership before everything was official and it blew the partnership.

"BCH is Bitcoin CasH. It is a fork from the original Bitcoin Blockchain, to implement a larger block size.
BTC is BiTcoin Core. It is a fork from the original Bitcoin Blockchain, to implement the Segregated Witness (SEGWIT) algorithm.

The original Bitcoin (you can call it 'bitcoin legacy') blockchain is not being mined anymore, so Bitcoin Core gets the coin 'ticket' BTC to their own coin name.

Anybody can fork a coin (to say the truth, you don't fork 'the coin', you just fork the blockchain that support that coin), throught setting new concensus in a new wallet software and mining a new block with the new concensus that is not being recognized by the forked blockchain software. Then you need to gain traction/adoption, because the forked blockchain need hashrate to start growing. Or perhaps, since you are rewriting the concensus rules, you can set in the new rules that any block 'signed' by you may be put in the blockchain, awarding you with the reward of writing a new block.

Bitcoin Cash born by rewriting the concensus rule, with a new rule named 'emergency dificulty adjust', so if in the last 24h there is less than 3 new blocks, the dificulty is adjusted to a half, and so. This way, after 3 days from the fork, the hashrate that jump in Bitcoin Cash succesfully mined enough blocks to survive. the month after, there were a lot of waves of intense mining and abandon, to allow the 'emergency dificulty adjust' to kick in. There was risky to BCH, but now the hashrate and the exchange rate is stable enough.

When Bitcoin Core releases the SEGWIT-enabled software that changes the concensus rules of the original bitcoin, practically all the hashrate jump-in the new rules, so Bitcoin Legacy was, 'de facto', abandoned.

Bitcoin Legacy, the original Bitcoin/Blockchain is dead. His two better children are Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash. Choose what you want.

"Nothing is 100% secure. Im sure people have come up with solutions that are more secure than a hardware wallet; like m out of n multisig off line paper wallets stored in multiple vaults. But when you actually want access to your crypto from a regular PC, hardware wallets are a superb compromise and far less risky than software only wallets.

"What doesn’t jive is paying *anyone* to promote a cryptocurrency. Advertising in crypto through use of celebrities is one thing but it should be abundantly clear that the celebrity is no more than a spokesman, has no involvement in day-to-day activities, and isn’t expected to have any understanding. But unfortunately every time a celebrity promotes something in the crypto space it’s intentionally done as a way to deceive people into thinking that celebrity is actually interested in the fundamental project behind the crypto.",1522739032
"For the hundredth time, [see this comment](http://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7dlyk4/censorship/duaqgxb) and the OP in that same thread. There are a couple of examples in there, but plenty more exist for anyone who bothers to actually look into the matter themselves.

Of course, me providing sources will not do any good around here; it never does. You'll either stop replying entirely, try to change the subject (usually to talk about a different subreddit or to make an ad hominem), or you'll rationalize the moderation in an irrational and inconsistent way, just like the dozens of predecessors who all chimed in with the mindless ""source?"" response when this uncomfortable truth is pointed out.

Oh, and as always, I'll be downvoted for stating facts and providing proofs. What fun.",1522738950

"Hi, a girl from Holland here 😊. Being a single mom since a few years and last year i found my new hobby besides taking care of my child and working: crypto. I spend lots of time reading on here. I find it very interesting to live in a time like this, and besides i love the technology i want my son to be able to go to college and do everything he loves. I am a long time hodler since trying to increase my crypto by buying low and selling high did not work for me 😉. Do you have any tips, crypto suggestions? Help a girl out 😊! P.S. Like the community so much here.. thanks!",1522738818
