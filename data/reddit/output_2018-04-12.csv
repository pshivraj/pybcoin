"The baker doesn't understand why they should give a shit about crypto, but may be forced to learn. To normies it's a ponzi-like. To governments making a living from subjugation and falsifying data it's a potential threat to their status quo. Normies should look at how governments view it and reappraise the situation.",1523602724
What are the biggest exchanges in which I can purchase crypto w/ fiat (USD) beyond just Coinbase/GDAX and Gemini? Any others?,1523602718

"Anyone with half a brain, not just ""the rich"" would NOT agree to this system. It's broken in several ways.

All it would do is scale the amount of currency based on the amount of people currently alive, the value of said currency per unit would be determined by the free market like any other currency.

All it would really do is make it a little more difficult for you to transfer your wealth to your kids/spouse when you die. Thats not a rich person thing, most decent people care about their kids and want to help them out by giving them their money when they die.

And how would it create more natural competition for jobs and skills or do anything for natural resources? There already is enough competition for jobs and skills. If you have a skill that people consider valuable, you can use it to gain wealth, whether you are gaining dollars or bitcoin or whatever is being used as currency,

There's nothing wrong with wealth being passed down. Its your money, you earned it, and you get to decide what to do with it, that includes what to do with it when you are gone.

Also, if it just ""vanished"", then what happens when someone (randomly or for a legitimate reason) goes broke because their wealth consists mostly of what was created when you were born?

I dont think you thought this through, or understand economics.",1523602677
"&gt;  Bcash is a hard fork of zcash, so it just confuses people. 

Meanwhile, Bitcoin Cash tries to mislead people to believe they are the ""true bitcoin"" and use their ticker for their subreddit.

Inb4 hurr /r/btc is for all kinds of bitcoins, whenever you post positive news about anything that's not Bitcoin Cash you'll get downvoted to hell, creating the same hivemind sub as /r/bitcoin. I've been lurking there for a while hoping that it was true that discussion between BTC, BCH, LTC, etc. was allowed, but 90% of the time it's just onesided.",1523602667

"I think it's a very good investment. FUN has a real use for blockchain and smart contracts, while still being at a relatively low market cap and approaching release.

"&gt; It is not racist if someone raped or killed someone else and you point it out. It is racist when you say that those people do it because they are Muslims but the mass shooters do it because of drugs. It is racist to believe that 1.8 billion people (25% of the world) are violent because of their beliefs. Because simply it is stereotyping. I didn't want to use the term racist until now but yes you are racist and ignorant. You don't know anything about Islam or Muslim people or their history. You keep talking without reading a book. All you know is just some wrong information you have read online.

Again, this has **absolutely nothing** to do with race! Read my other comment in this thread, and watch the two videos, then come with some counterpoints:

https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8bw23x/bitcoin_cash_is_permissible_under_islamic_law/dxadiuk/
 
&gt; Once again, let's stop this. You keep believing in your superior civilized yourself while believing 1.8 billion people are just murderous terrible violent people. And I will keep believing that everyone is just equal and same regardless of their religion.

I never said the whole 1.8 Billion are terrible people, but a **majority** *do* hold views that are incompatible with the western world! These are **facts** as told by actual moderate Muslims! (Seriously, watch to two videos in my other comment.)

&gt; I will not read you next comment. I will not respond to your next comment no matter what you say because I truly believe that it is a waste of time. Have a good life.

"Is it me or does the quality of core trolling feel a little more desperate of late? BTC fees are back, LN not doing too good, Bitcoin Cash accelerating merchant adoption around the world - must be tough.",1523602538
"While what you stated in the first part is true, I'd also like to point out that OP's statement is true, as well.  I would imagine that most people at some (or many) points in their lives have wished there was an easier way to handle money.  Crypto has the potential to fulfill those (sometimes unrealized) wishes.  ",1523602534
"The long term supply is fixed, being able to subdivide the units doesn't make it any less scarce. All new units are unlocked with costly work, so no one can freely or arbitrarily create more bitcoin and devalue the hodlings of others, which is the major problem with centralized fiat money.",1523602475
"hmm... thinking about investing in bitcoin within next 3 years.

"If you asked me couple days ago, I would've said it might be worth it. However, with bitcoin and other alts pumping (some pumping hard), it does seem a bit risky. It's a bit harder for BNB to increase its satoshi levels, since BTC went up. Maybe if you're just adding in fiat I would say it might be ok, but not if you have other crypto....

ANd I'm like 90% in BNB right now too so I do hope for some pump.",1523602422
"Doesn't surprise me that it happened. There was bound to be resistance at some point. This was inevitable. It was only a matter of time. All the weak hands that kept panicking about bitcoin dipping got shaken out. The ones left were the true believers who will never sell for Fiat and the ones who are in it for the long term who probably aren't selling until the next reward halvening.

Doesn't necessarily mean shorting will stop. We're just seeing weak hands being shaken out on both sides. This is essentially starting to feel like one big game of chicken.

"Agree for the safety and hodl principle but disagree about leaving/forgetting them. Crypto moves so fast, there are scams, major news, project crashing, etc. You have to keep up with the news and be ready to act if something comes up.",1523602396

"Solving this problem is sooo simple, just

1) Buy (commodity), then
2) Hodl (store of value), then
3) Spend (medium of exchange).

As more and more people do so, bitcoin will render from commodity to store of value to medium of exchange.  Mission accomplished. When bitcoin reaches its true value imo at least about $500k per BTC, on its way there manipulation will decrease significantly.",1523602132
"I believe that’s correct! The fee is essentially just the Gas price of the transaction. I believe on the initial roll out of the market place (25th) there will be 24 ERC20 pairs. There won’t be fiat/ crypto pairings for the initial release, but they have indicated that is something they would look to develop in the future. What gives the AST token it’s value, is that market makers are required to lock up a set amount of AST for a particular period of time. Utility token value= Total network value/ token velocity. Having the tokens locked up by large market makers will reduce the amount circulating increasing price.",1523602127

"Well BTC has been trading in the $6500 to $7500 range since March 29th, so the $1000 was obvious but I wasn't sure in which direction but the MACD showed signs of bullish momentum even though the RSI was overbought and now it shows it's even more overbought.

What you have is some whale out there pumping this market to squeeze the shorts and boy did they do it.  There also hasn't been any serious selling in 4 days which is something to consider.",1523602016
Making speculators even more keen to jump on it and making it harder for actual users to use bitcoin as it was intended.,1523601955
How is this different from selling your btc for fiat and waiting to buy back at a lower price?,1523601941
"I increased my stack ~40% during the past two weeks because I suspected a short-term recovery was coming.  Q2 is historically very good for BTC and crypto in general.  Plus, we didn't revisit the yearly low during the downtrend and today's spike blew up a lot of bears leveraging shorts.  ",1523601905

"Ho yeah, I agree, there's certainly an increase of interest for blockchain. And some hefty budget for R&amp;D in the field. But that money is not pouring in the crypto market (coins, tokens) we have access to. Like partnerships, the aim here is to investigate the ideas and opportunities of the blockchain technologies.

- allows instant POS payments with crypto (or fiat)
- simple for customer - open app on phone - tap phone on POS - instant payment approval
- complete backend to allow many other applications, can literally replace bank accounts
- can use it with ATMs with zero fees
- no fees with POS either
- merchant reward system 
- artificial intelligence to track global spending patterns with aim to encourage better spending habits helping to eliminate debts
- pilot program already running in canada with over 7000 atm's and all POS 
- pilot in usa starting very soon
- public launch after pilots, expanding to many other countries (europe/australia/etc...)
- destroys competition like tenx bread metalpay
- you also get plastic debit card for free
- integration with many blockchain is in the works

"**Money burning**

Money burning or burning money is the purposeful act of destroying money. In the prototypical example, banknotes are destroyed by literally setting them on fire. Burning money decreases the wealth of the owner without directly enriching any particular party. However, according to the quantity theory of money, because it reduces the supply of money it increases by the same amount the collective wealth of everyone else who owns said money.

"It’s a decentralised exchange. That is it allows individuals to trade peer to peer completely cutting out the typical fees and percentage cuts that traditional exchanges charge. Besides cost savings, there’s an abundance of benefits to using decentralised exchanges (DEX’s). For one, you might have heard of a lot of the exchange hacks that occur, that’s because using a centralised exchange involves third party risk. You have to put your money on a centralised exchange, if it gets hacked, goes down, goes bankrupt, you lose everything. These several DEXs in the market currently looking to gain traction (AirSwap, Kyber, 0x) but what sets AirSwap apart from other DEXs is their focus on providing a platform for institutional investors to use to trade crypto.

The Nayirah testimony was a false testimony given before the Congressional Human Rights Caucus on October 10, 1990, by a 15-year-old girl who provided only her first name, Nayirah. The testimony was widely publicized, and was cited numerous times by United States senators and President George H. W. Bush in their rationale to back Kuwait in the Gulf War. In 1992, it was revealed that Nayirah's last name was al-Ṣabaḥ (Arabic: نيره الصباح‎) and that she was the daughter of Saud Al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti ambassador to the United States. Furthermore, it was revealed that her testimony was organized as part of the Citizens for a Free Kuwait public relations campaign which was run by an American public relations firm Hill &amp; Knowlton for the Kuwaiti government.

"&gt; There's more than one way to shadowban someone. And its not spam, spam is content that is meant to be blasted repeatedly, outside of reposting points that I made that your community vote-brigaded beyond visibility, I rarely if ever post the same content in different threads. That's twice now you've played fast and loose with the definition of terms. FUD was wrong and now spam.

Again total dishonesty from you. I see you doublepost almost every time, some times posts some times comments, but it happens ALOT.

&gt; Again, this is established, verifiable history. You can read the tweets yourself. The fact that you're defending even this makes your motives more clear however. There is nothing that he could say or do that would make you change your mind. I wonder why that is?

What matters are his intentions, something you have zero idea about. You are just speculating and trying to project your personal dislike for the man in a way that is unreasonable.

&gt; No, the numbers used in that column have that restriction, but the report makes clear in several places that RingCT doesn't really mitigate the problem and indeed, monero is still 45% traceable TODAY, RIGHT NOW.

Nope, you are wrong. Those numbers are used with a bunch of attacks to get to the final numbers presented. RingCT and mandatory SA are overlooked in a sensationalist report. It is angeled to make the problem look much worse than it is.

&gt; Source? Even if what you said were true, its not, how does Evan holding the largest amount of Dash hurt Dash? Satoshi holds plenty of bitcoin, Vitalk holds plenty of Eth, so why would this be an issue?

Oh no source needed, it is, in your own words, established, verifiable history. You can read about it yourself. Yes a bunch of people hold a bunch  of coins but they didn't try to mine it behind everyones back only to apply mental gymnastics and make it a ""good thing"" LOL. Lucky for Evan that his following is more of a cult than anything else, critical thinking humans actually laugh quite alot at how brainwashed you people are. And you wonder why Dash has a bad reputation.

&gt; But the fact is that Evan wasn't the only one mining that day and those coins were dumped on exchanges very shortly after the fast-mine for pennies on the dollar. There was no way of knowing Dash would blow up as it has. And finally, the community voted against restarted the network as it would've been unfair to those who already got their coins. Anyway, this is water under the bridge for four years now. It has NO effect on Dash today and it had a POSITIVE effect on Dash back then (much more rapid liquidity/distribution than otherwise). Monero on the other hand, has a flaw that makes its transactions traceable 45% of the time, shouldn't you be worried about that?

Only none of that is true, it is actually ridiculous that someone could even be this brainwashed. It might be water under the bridge for you but to everyone else it is the proof that Dash is and always will be a scam.

&gt; In other words, this paper was rightly shown to be a non-issue. 

Sure you can keep telling yourself that and just ignore that an a paper concluded that Dash was traceable even with darksend, that was what the paper said, even if it was hindered because of obfuscation. You can post answers from Dashforce, but it just shows how dishonest you are since you completely ignore Moneros answer to the analysis on them while all of a sudden dashforcednews is some sort of authority.

The actual report stated """"This is a significant weakness of mixing as an anonymity tech-nique. In this section we provide evidence that Dash, a cryptocurrency designed with mixing in mind, is susceptible to this attack""."" I think I'll believe that rather than Dash's own propaganda machine.

&gt; Monero on the other hand, will never be used as a privacy currency again shortly.

Again, you show your true motives. Keep hoping but don't hold your breath.

&gt; This is only true recently, for the vast majority of monero's history it was use that or use CLI. Monero's user experience is absolutely horrible on the CLI and just bareable with mymonero. 

I have used both so you can't fool me. CLI is not that hard if you have half a brain, but like you say oh Evan stealing half of the supply is ""water under the bridge"" but Monero only having a CLI wallet back in the day is somehow still an issue? There are several GUI wallets today. Even back then there was a pretty decent GUI made by a community member, I tried it, it worked well.

&gt; If it was the lead f@cking developer of Dash it would! Are you freaking serious right now? How far up this man's @nus are you guys willing to go? That's a long way to go for a date my friend...

Fluffy is not the ""lead developer"" he just happens to be a vocal member of the community, I feel your hate for him but please stick to the truth. I would also like to know how often Evan forces you to do wierd shit in your cult ceremonies, because those fantasies you are having about Fluffy seem strange, is that what ""Dashforce"" is?

&gt; Except Monero is a fork of bytecoin and inherited everything about the coin. Saying that it 'has nothing to do with monero' is thus a bit disingenuous don't you think?

Being a fork of something doesn't mean that you inherit everything, stop playing dumb. It was the huge premine of Bytecoin that made it a scam, Monero did not inherit this, just to give an example. Just like PIVX isn't a scam even though it was forked from a coin simililar to Bytecoin with a huge premine, you guessed it, your favorite scam coin, Dash. 

&gt; But the original developers of monero after the fork deliberately released a crippled miner so they could cheat and scam the community. Vitalk did a fascinating write up of it.

And some more lies. Keep them coming, it just shows how desperate you are. Hey I think that I know who you are now, MasterMined710 is that you?

You talk about deliberately releasing a crippled miner, this was the first dev in Bitmonero, he was kicked out and the whole issue was/is communicated openly and is open Monero history, no scam from anyone involved in Monero now. Still compared to what Dash did, this is small potatos, not to mention that one person somehow managed to brainwash the entire community in to thinking it was ""**good** lmfao, you guys kill me with that nonsense. 

Hey atleast Monero admits that Bitmoneros broken Miner was a problem, but they kicked the guy that did it the fk out. Dash on the other hand made the cheater their cult leader.

This says alot about the different mindsets of the projects, in Monero if you scam and cheat, you get kicked out. In Dash you get celebrated. That is forever the face of Dash, greedy selfserving cheaters/scammers.

&gt; What kind of people do you have to be to behave that way? Sure you say its 'just a couple of guys', but I can't find any posts in the monero sub that are the opposite of that. I can find plenty that have that same tenor though. 

You can't find any posts in the Monero sub that are opposite of that? WTF are you talking about? which brings me to your next quote:

&gt; Challenge, show me one post I've made, with quotes that has either a lie or attempted manipulation, let alone either of those in an attempt to shill Dash. My post history is open, go ahead. We've got time. 

Just look right above this quote, you can't find a single post in the Monero forum that isn't on the level of ""impersonating public figures""? That didn't take long, just scan your latest reply to me and you find tons of lies, half truths and manipulation. Most of you Dash people are like politicians, you recon that if you only spin things enough, twist enough words...eventually people will give up.

&gt; Disputed by whom? The monero community who have a vested interest in you not knowing their privacy model doesn't work and NEVER did? Non-peer reviewed?? Its being presented at a conference this July. Competition is fine, you guys have NO PROBLEM criticizing Dash even though you're a 'competing coin'. I guess what's good for the goose is good for the gander, probably shouldn't have based your community around being giant flaming assholes to everyone. That paints a target on your back I guess shrug.

You sound angry I must say. Yes disputed by the people that represent Monero, just as it was made by people who represent ZCash. Competition is fine, who said it isn't? The only one who sounds angry is you. I guess because Dash is widely known to be a scam and isn't evben in said competition, that's what you are angry about?

&gt; In other words, its not the real deal and they couldn't use the technique to deanon ACTUAL privatesend tx'es, so its a non-issue

They didn't try but nowhere does it say that it can not be done. All of these papers are theoretical. They just said: we did it as a test implementation, it was not unproblematic but it worked. If it works in practice remains to be seen. That is what the report said. 

&gt;In monero, however, they can trace the origin of a coin 45 FREAKING PERCENT OF THE TIME. Now that is a problem and indeed does count. You have to be intelligent enough to tell the difference.

Yes when only counting 1 of 3 privacy features. Theoretically, just like the Dash report. You can get 45% of ring signatures figured out, trying to find the origin in practice via this technique is something entirely different.

"&gt; OK. So we both agree that there are 3 miners right now who have the power to simply collectively mine their own chain and control the entire chain.

No, you'd need top 4 miners to get just a little shy of 50% as of current data - ViaBTC 16%, BTC.com 12,5%, AntPool 11%, bitcoin.com 10% (49,5%), so you'd probably need top 5 + SBI crypto, that is 55%.

But if these 5 make an agreement then yes, they would control the chain (if we disregard the fact that these are also pools and would loose non-trivial amount of hash if they did this, likely pushing them under 50% and needing 6+ top miners)

as I said, this is highly unlikely and that security of Bitcoin would be broken if it ever happened.

"You are quite wrong. Your age assessment of me is based on your assessment of the internet culture. Believing it to only be kids that represent the MEME. I also know full well what the MEME represents in Human Existence. I am fully in agreement that it is utilized as a new language. As that age old ""a picture tells a thousand words"" is utilized and recreated over and over to represent much much more in a mere picture, with or without text.


My point was not an issue with the culture. It was with the fact that FINANCE for many that mess with Crypto is suddenly no longer the serious undertaking that it should be. A person should NOT be emotionally influenced when departing with a large sum of money. Yet the MEMES are acting as just that for a large part. For this sign to then utilize those words ""MOFO = FOMO"" is pure emotional strings pulling. For a certain kind of person too. They know full well that a seasoned investor or mature investor wouldn't even know what those acronyms mean! So their target is clearly the young.. hot headed, non rationalizing individual.. who probably doesn't bring that much funds, but they see mass making millions rather than millionaires in masses. This is why I see this as damaging.


It's like for example.. imagine a big bank decides to make a big billboard ad like that on the topic of first home buyer. They seek some marketing catch phrase... because this mental manipulation to make decisions obviously goes wayy back.. So the marketing team gets a little cheeky and comes up with.. ""YOUR DREAM BEACH HOUSE AWAITS, BUY NOW, DON'T BE A BITCH"" attached to a stock image of a house by the beach. Now that's clever, and edgy.. and even utilized a street word for representing a person who is hesitant to make a decision. Yet, it doesn't feel right does it.. or professional... NO! Because we collectively accept and uphold, that this is a serious decision to make in life... for a Bank to treat is in such a manner would not sit right.


This is my point. That it's not the culture that is at fault... OR the participants. After all, we are all following our instincts and those DO come from a place within ourselves where emotion is the primary force. So it's actually EXTRA work to make a rationalization. Many don't.. and so they simply go off the high. That IMPULSE. That is why I see it as so damaging. It's made to be a game. ""Hand over your money and get your moon gifs now... hurry!"" It's an insult to us really that they would utilize this as marketing. Culture is always culture. It changes with time. The intertwining of the two by those who know how Human Mind works and how it can be manipulated so easily.. that's the issue...

"Very fair, and I don’t mean in any way that there should be pettiness or shitting on code itself, I only meant that if the problem was the code, they would be calling out specific problems with the results, not simply repeating the litany of what Core didn’t do (blocksize) and that their main transgressions have been non code related (trolling, shilling, censorship). I actually feel bad if people thought my intent was to say people should shit on others code, it is hard, and I will dig into core and bch code based on what you’ve said.

But speaking to the part about me not being honest saying I’ve not heard positives...what I mean is I’ve heard lots of positives in terms of x is adopting, y is now accepting cash, etc...but these are basically congratulating ourselves for a specific past decision, and then mainly marketing...I have honestly been looking for the positives being put forth on both sides, and the positives, to me, come across as ‘see, the blocksize increase was the right decision’ and that’s the end of it.  Maybe I’m just not seeing more because of so much negativity/backlash that it gets draining slogging through it.

On the btc side, I feel to some extent that they feel as though they’re simply retaliating...bch and btc are a threat to each other for adoption, and because of the shared history and name, but there is just so much potential, on either side, that if either of them raised up above the mud slinging and focused on what they can do as opposed to what the other can’t, I honestly think that’s the coin that is going to move.  There is the obvious argument that they have to defend themselves against the negativity, but if that’s the case, then they need to figure out how to do it with positivity instead of just throwing negativity back the other direction, because it’s just dragging both down. Most of it, by the point, is the community, and the community on reddit isn’t the coin, so hopefully other avenues are less petty and things will play out as they will.

"**Christianity and violence**

Christians have held diverse views towards violence and non-violence through time. Currently and historically there have been four views and practices within Christianity toward violence and war: non-resistance, Christian pacifism, Just war theory, and the Crusade (Holy or preventive war). Concepts such as ""Holy war"", whereby fighting itself might be considered a penitential and spiritually meritorious act, did not emerge before the 11th century. The concept of ""Just war"", whereby limited uses of war were considered acceptable originated with non-Christian Roman and Greek thinkers such Cicero and Plato.

"So, early adopters shouldn't be rewarded because they had the foresight to work on a project that they thought it would be profitable.   Distribution was handled by the early coders that mined bitcoin and all those people transacting with each other even when there was no real use case at the current time.  Every currency ever created is to be made as a store of value.  One of the main reason why current fiat stay consistent is because pulling out of the gold standard and the constant printing.",1523595994
"&gt; Bitcoin was never going to retain &gt;90% dominance.

That may or may not be true. If OPcodes weren't disabled, eth wouldn't have existed. Imagine all of the value of eth in bitcoin (though I'm sure you'd be complete against that haha). There will always be pumps and dumps because of greed.

&gt; But once you exceed a certain threshold, you can't come back.

What kind of things can you not fix?

&gt; So you cannot validate the full UTXO set.

I'm sure someone will figure something out. Adoption brings in more people who will work on the code. 

&gt; At some point Roger said to him becoming PayPal 2.0 is an acceptable risk.

I know this gets thrown around a lot but I see it in the same way that you're okay risking bitcoin becoming MySpace. 

&gt; If one hub tries to enforce AML/KYC or some funny business, you pick a different hub to route your money through! Or you open a channel directly with whoever you want to transact!

Easily said but I think on chain fees will price most people out of the latter option and force people to use AML/KYC hubs.

&gt; Let's not forget that the barriers to entry for a LN hub are pretty low, so opening a ""well funded hub"" is nowhere near as expensive as running a huge mining operation or a bank.

Which is a problem to me. LN turn into the equivalent of PoS running on top of PoW chain that isn't secured enough because LN is sucking up fee value that should be going to miners. When someone has a bigger stake, it's easier to get more. With mining you can always be toppled. Also, I think mining will get decentralized even more for reasons to the post I linked. 

&gt; Maybe you're right... but what if you're not. Again like playing Russian roulette, when it's too late, we can't go back. We fucked up.

I guess I rather go bold than be too cautious. 

&gt; So you're relying on miners to impose fees? Well, if the end state are miner imposed fees, why not have it with a block size limit. 

Because miner decided one is based on operating cost + profit, not an arbitrary limit.

&gt; They provide a service, and get paid for it.

Yes, they are a business, not accountants.

&gt; If miners can determine fees, doesn't that sound a lot like banking to you? Who, after all, determines fees in traditional banking? We'd be at the mercy of the miners, and that's something we should steer away from as hard as possible - Users are in control, not miners. As it should be.

No, because banks have regulations protecting them, preventing more efficient businesses from taking their place. Miners will always have competition so they will be forced to keep fees low. If they try to hold out for high fees, other miners will mine the transactions that are profitable. The fees will be determined by a free market, not a centrally controlled arbitrary limit.

"I highly respect your honesty and humility regarding your level of understanding. That's very refreshing.

Reading code that is contributed to open source projects can be quite intuitive. Typically, most developers include notes in their commits regarding what they've been working on, what their code is built on top of, or what their code modifies in the system. But even with these notes available, understanding the code comes down to your own ability to not only read the language but also piece together what the code does.

Coming back to your reply in earnest, you make a handful of assumptions that are incredibly reaching and are, as I perceive them, off base/out of touch.

In regards to not hearing positivity on both sides, I disagree completely. If you spend a day or two in a forum with a focus leaning towards either BTC or BCH you'll hear news about client development or exciting features in the works. If you're asking for opposing factions to praise the other side, why? Why the desire for everyone to sing kumbaya and hold hands? Are you familiar with the Hong Kong and New York Agreements? The sentimentality you're advocating for led to trepidation over doing what was actually needed: calling Core out on their bullshit. Failing this, our community experienced years of stagnation.

Addressing the point you made regarding, (forgive my paraphrasing): ""if Core's code is actually bad, and no one points it out, that means that there aren't any better developers capable of reviewing it so it must actually be good"". This is an extremely unwise line of thought and I'd encourage you to look a layer deeper moving forward. There are people criticizing Cores code. Hell, the list of people criticizing their work is just as long as the list of people praising it. Computer scientists, professors, coding professionals with credentials on par with any of the Core devs, and on and on. You're claiming you've never read one negative review of anything Core ever produced? I don't believe that for a moment.

So to bring it all together: why, if in fact Core produces terrible code on occasion, do you not hear Devs in BCH putting it down and attempting to humiliate BTC devs for their work, two reasons. 

One: Writing code is very hard. The people who actually give a shit about producing good code efficiently aren't interested in mud slinging and name calling. You'll find the trait your describing most typically in the individuals who claim to be wizards, but in reality, spend far more time trolling than they do producing useful code.

Two: This is open source code development. Anyone can use any code produced for anything at any time without any permission needed from anyone else. If your code is shit, it is self evident. It is on display for everyone to review and use if they choose. Poor work and useless, broken code is disregarded, because in the tech sector, everything moves at lightning speed. If BCH aims to be useable, efficient, and secure, it has no time to waste on the efforts of developers who do not care about their project. Why waste words or time trying to refute it publicly? That knowledge is common amongst devs. Try asking a BCH Dev for yourself regarding their opinion of something like RBF, Segwit, or most anything in the Core code base and see what type of reply you get.

Pettiness shouldn't be so common in code development that people come to expect that behaviour.",1523595247

"I'll let one of the Satoshi's answer that. (edit - mods removed because no NP in source)

&gt; Most folks - even those who have read the Bitcoin white-paper - don't realise that there are two chains within Bitcoin.
&gt; 
&gt; The first is the chain of digital signatures which shows the passage of coin ownership from the coinbase transaction onwards.
&gt; 
&gt; The second is the chain of blocks which lock in the chronological order of events witnessed.
&gt; 
&gt; It appears the folks behind SegWit wish to keep the blockChain and allow the signatureChain to be optionally thrown away.
&gt; 
&gt; This will effectively make Bitcoin-SegWit no-longer a crypto-currency.

"https://btcprivate.org/

Let me quote from this site itself:

&gt;A hard fork is when a single cryptocurrency splits in two. It occurs when a cryptocurrency’s existing code is changed, resulting in both an old and new version. This case is somewhat unique, whereby ZCL and BTC were co-forked into Bitcoin Private (BTCP).",1523593363
"No, I don’t think that at all.  What I do think is that I haven’t heard of anything being done on Bitcoin Cash since the split.  Maybe they’re going crazy with all kinds of great things, but I literally never hear anything ‘good’ about Bitcoin Cash outside of ‘it’s closer to the white paper’,’it has zero fees because it’s blocksize is bigger’,’if anything happens, we can increase the blocksize’, and finally, maybe the only improvement I’ve even heard mentioned, is possibly kind of hacking an existing feature to kind of make colored coins.  This is almost exactly my previous argument that if btc had gone the blocksize route first, everyone would be happy and wouldn’t want to deal with crazy things like segwit and stuff.

Now, colored coins, and they way I’ve heard of them being implemented is both positive from the ‘user ingenuity’ and an almost perfect example of core having a brilliant Dev team and Cash maybe not even having a Dev team? Maybe just an inexperienced or shy one? Literally this one innovation and the way I understand it would be implemented would be to just kind of make it so the clients would use an existing underutilized field and it would work with minimal code? While this could work just fine, it’s close to things I’ve heard from our operations teams, when Dev doesn’t have enough time to actually do something, theyll just start storing this new piece of information in a field that isn’t used for anything else. Maybe ask Dev to change to idled to show up on all their forms.

Now from a development side, if I heard this, I would think they would take that suggestion, laugh at it for a minute, then come up with a similar field they could actually use for the purpose, some helper fields/functions/whatever to avoid the other hacky piece they were going to use to get around that other limitation, maybe give the overall process a referable name, and start coding, testing, recoding, etc.

Bitcoin Cash made it perfectly clear that they weren’t willing to sacrifice inexpensive, on chain transaction.  BTC made it perfectly clear that they were willing to risk those, even suffer through the lack of them.  You can argue against that, I can argue against that, we can both argue for other things.  I am just saying that going for good things is the right direction, but thousands of people seem to disagree and want to boost their coin not by making it better, but mainly through arguing how much the other guys sucks.

Anyther think that comes up regularly is that btc works with low transaction fees when there is low volume, and that’s a legitimate consern.  But was hasn’t been mentioned is that bch may scale better transaction wise with volume, because you can scale the blocksize, but it hasn’t been tested under the other pressures associated with volume, the problems that only show up when the coin is literally attacked, the leader on the mining chain, when you’re worried that its profitable enough that miners start tweaking things in their favor on your coin, what if things ‘do’ start centralizing even after you’ve done you part by waving your hands and saying ‘that probably won’t happen’ and ‘hard drives and bandwidth will increase faster than we have to increase the blocksize and start filling them up.  Are you guys actively working even on the pruning that will be required to make things pseudo-decentralized during the periods when bandwidth needed and bandwidth available to distributed users is out of sync?",1523593294
"As in bought in when BTC was $700, right? I thought about that too, but it makes the story even less likely...

"&gt; You require more effort than a simple ""Stop shilling a shitcoin""

Hahaha, believe it or not I am trying to understand.

&gt; ""Small blockers/Core will never want to increase the block size!""

Yes, I hear that, but they also never say when it will happen. I want to know what the exact criteria is to increase the block size. They also never say how decentralized bitcoin should be. If either of those statements are false please let me know.

&gt; I do support block increases, but NOT before all possible optimizations have been done. Optimizations of txs size

I suppose this is the very core of the issue. Who decides when enough efficiencies have been implemented to raise the block size? I mean, we're going to need bigger blocks anyway so why not a bit now to not lose to altcoins (well tbh, now that there's BCH, I hope BTC doesn't increase the block size until every single small blocker agrees to :p)

I believe we should be fostering adoption while adding those efficiencies.
 
&gt; only once we're all on-board with careful space management

Who decides when ""we're all on-board""?

&gt; Big blocks externalize costs for companies (think about it) - Social costs and private profits?

That's the point of the block reward. It's a subsidy to get the network and ecosystem bootstrapped. Companies get to use the blockchain for cheap to provide additional value to the network/infrastructure. If everyone thought like that, no one would use it, just invest. Just hold and magically wait for everyone to use it ""when it's ready"". No one is going wait for when bitcoin is ""perfect"". It's good enough.

But, thanks to the fork we can do what we think is best. I just think that BCH will win out because we will be working on adoption. By the time all those improvements are ready on BTC, I believe BCH will have more adoption than BTC (that's the goal anyway). It will be less work to copy those improvements to BCH than to move all the BCH users to BTC.

Since it's a fundamental difference in philosophy, I don't think we can convince each other but I really do appreciate the discussion. It's very rare these days. Cheers!

"At the time it was nearing its implementation date, it was closed source and virtually the only thing I heard about it was that it was crashing on their testnet, since it wasn’t published,  no one could review the code to see what was going on, and their main ‘explanation’ was that Core was being malicious and attacking it on their testnet.  Since the patches they were building to fix the issue was closed source, people they wanted to fork off onto this new chain would have basically had to do so blindly, with the assurance that the problem would be fixed in time, and I guess not to worry about it?  The one quote that stuck with me was that, since their patches where closed, someone on Core must have infiltrated their repo to know what to exploit.  That comment alone may have shaded my view of them, but just to imagine, they were saying that to improve this open source software, they wanted to apply some closed source code that was bad enough that if someone saw it, they could do malicious stuff to it...their security was to prevent people from seeing how they were doing things.

You can correct me on specifics if you want, but I wasn’t heavily looking into things at the time, and maybe I was being fed cherry picked explanations, but reading things strictly put out by the group supposedly building the fork, I was horrified to think that it was going to be implemented on the same chain, without doublespend protection...let alone that people were actually going to trust something like bitcoin where patches and a new client were going to closed source.",1523592105

"Build up a PORTFOLIO of semi and ""100% absentee"" businesses and incoming producing assets. A simple example might look something like this: 
*Replace* with anything you want that can make money with and provide *relatively* safe, consistent returns in evergreen markets.
A Convenience store, tattoo parlor, gas station, multiple online businesses, restaurants, car lots- ANYTHING you're interested in. Do extensive due diligence and pick up established businesses that have been around for a GOOD WHILE and fit within your investment parameters. ( I rarely look at anything under 5 years old except for certain industries) 
Rentals, property, precious metals, stocks, crypto, bonds, 
etc..

There are literally MILLIONS of different opportunities outside of the stock and crypto markets, and arguably SAFER at that. ( people will still need to purchase gas, bread, condoms, etc,  when the value of their stock/crypto is at super lows) While simplistic, the basic idea is to make your money work for you, not the other way around. You can spend 40+ years working super hard for someone else and end up with a decent living, or you can build/buy your way to financial freedom in a fraction of that time and build up TRUE retirement plan. Then, if you're successful and set up, just buy a few extra businesses for an additional income stream and offer to help anyone in your life that  wants to build up their OWN set of income producing assets. Create generational wealth that doesn't hinge on the value of one asset alone.

People had positions where they bet on BTC to go down in price, called a short position.  To do this, you borrow someone else's BTC, sell it, and buy it back at a lower price.  However, they expect you to pay back the BTC regardless of what actually happens.  

If BTC got too high you could never afford to buy it back with what's in your account, so there's a threshold where the system will automatically close your position/buy BTC before that happens in order to make the lender whole.  Usually this threshold is some percentage of your overall account.  You typically can't short unless you have other assets.

When a lot of people are shorting like this, a cascade can happen.  When the price gets too high, people will have their positions closed for them and BTC will be purchased automatically with their accounts.  Of course, with the buy, the price gets higher.  This causes more short positions to be closed, causing a higher price, and on and on.

If you're not paying attention, the price can get very high and wipe out a large amount of your account.  It's brutal and savage, and people get rekt.",1523590735

Right now, nothing is priced in bitcoin.  Anywhere. And if it is, it's directly linked to how it's doing against fiat.  For the sake of simplicity lets pretend that I have a widget I can buy for exactly 1 bitcoin based on the current price of bitcoin.  I sell it for 2 bitcoin to customers and people buy it all day long.

That widget might only cost me 1 bitcoin today, but tomorrow the value of bitcoin may go down, so it's going to cost me more than that 1 bitcoin since I'll need to add more bitcoin to cover the difference.

Meanwhile, if I were using dollars.  I wont have that issue at all.   Ever. Unless of course you think the currency is going to collapse and that's incredibly unlikely for the foreseeable future so I'm not going to delve into any arguments that rely on that.

That would be true. The only problem with that statement is that I can't think of any alts that are more useful in exchange than BCH. 

Even Dash is orders of magnitude more expensive than BCH when the transaction counts get high. Monero is the only one that has a really nice advantage going in terms of privacy, but is very slow, expensive, and cumbersome to use.

Greater number of transactions =/= More usable

BCH is after the M1 stock. The best money. I honestly no longer understand what BTC is for anymore. Perhaps you can help me understand that. ",1523586746
"&gt;The urgency I see is bitcoin being overtaken by something else. I guess bitcoin dominance on the downtrend doesn't bother you but it bothers me.

Bitcoin was never going to retain &gt;90% dominance.... that's just not credible. And fees don't have anything to do with it. It's simply that people want different things. Some people were *genuinely* bullish on Bitconnect, and we know how that ended. Look, I tried to talk various people into buying Bitcoin. Three examples of what happened:

""*It's too expensive, and I like to buy integer quantities*"" --&gt; Bought ETH

""*I'll buy a fuckton of XRP, that's what banks use!*"" --&gt; Didn't buy anything

""*I don't know, ETH was supported by Puting.*"" --&gt; Bought ETH, is Russian

Do you know what **NEVER** happened?

""*Naaaaah, I'm not buying Bitcoin, the fees are too high!*""

Never. Ever.

Crypto will change a lot of things in this world, but we'll all chase riches. And SO many people bought shitcoins/ICO scams/fuck all altcoins in the hope of getting ""the next Bitcoin"". That's why Bitcoin lost dominance, not because of fees. (Also, let's not forget that market cap is easily manipulated, and there are incentives to do just that.)


&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I don't know where you're from, but in a lot of cases, it is my country's (US) fault that certain regions are fucked up. I see crypto as a way to take the power to print money and subsidize the wars away from the powerful.

I'm not American, and do agree with this sentiment. But don't beat yourself up, YOU didn't do it. And YOUR generation didn't do it either. And for all those cases where the US did play a role, there are others where it did not. We can't save everyone, and things will improve over time. From a historical perspective, if it takes Venezuela some 5 extra years to get out of the mess, it won't matter very much.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;It is not a problem right now so I'm saying to continue the formula that has been successful for bitcoin before a fee market emerged. 

Problem with this is that it's a very slippery slope... just one more MB, why not. Next thing you know, it's a centralized shitshow all over again. Making ""responsible financial decisions"" is painful, at every level. But once you exceed a certain threshold, you can't come back. One case in point, though not directly related, a country's debt. At some point it's just impossible to go back, and when those cuts are forced on you, it's painful. I say better some pain now that it's all still small than once we have REAL adoption. Then it will be too late.


&gt;To me, forcing a block limit now is going in a direction that hasn't been tested before.

Not just to you... that's 100% correct. But it doesn't mean we shouldn't experiment. Again, on-chain is still available, and always will be. Can we make LN work as designed? Let's try. And as I argued previously, there's no real rush, my mom doesn't even know wtf is Bitcoin!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; If bitcoin's chain gets unmanageably large, a HF could be done where a block N-100000 is effectively the new genesis block of the HF chain.

If only it was that simple in Bitcoin... problem is some coins are sitting still from the very first block! (Satoshi's coins, for example.) So you cannot validate the full UTXO set. Which then makes it all too easy to introduce a trusted set up - Someone tells you that the snapshot they sent you can be trusted. And here goes the trustless nature of the blockchain. Thanks, but no thanks.

if you, or anyone else, could find a way to do proper node pruning, along the lines of ETH, it would be big news! And believe me that block size would not be an issue. (Well, not as big an issue.) Not an easy problem to crack, if it has a solution at all!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The point I'm trying to make is, what is a good enough level of decentralization? I never get a clear answer from small blockers.

Valid point... and I don't know. But I do know that I don't know, so I'm approaching this carefully. Better safe than sorry. 

At some point Roger said to him becoming PayPal 2.0 is an acceptable risk. Could not disagree more. That is NOT a risk we can take, because it's literally like playing Russian roulette - Once you fuck up, it's too late. For bitcoin, it means back to a centrally controlled coin.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; A hub screws you over and you can't settle on chain because you can't afford it.

Let's not forget that the barriers to entry for a LN hub are pretty low, so opening a ""well funded hub"" is nowhere near as expensive as running a huge mining operation or a bank. This means you can expect to have several ""large hubs"". And none of them really knows when you're gonna send the money, nor who the money is going to, etc. And due to competition, some may even offer to settle for you!

I'm not saying there will never ever be a problem, I'm sure there will. But hubs won't be able to target people - If one hub tries to enforce AML/KYC or some funny business, you pick a different hub to route your money through! Or you open a channel directly with whoever you want to transact!

The echo the comment above, this is uncharted territory. But personally, I'm excited to explore it.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I trust miners more than hubs. If a miner wants to not mine my TX, another miner will.

I actually don't. Because there will be many more hubs than miners, see cost of entry above. And if it's easy to set up a hub, competition forces you to be more hones. People only become dis-honest when they have control/monopoly over something.  And miners could be FORCED into a cartel... by worldwide governements! There's no more than ~20 pools right now. Do you really think that's impossible to regulate globally?

And I hope mining gets more decentralized, that's why I'm happy about Halong! But until then, we cannot make plans on wishful thinking.


&amp;nbsp;

&gt;There will always be a backlog of TX because demand for it is infinite but the resources needed to provide that will not.

We're talking about practical ""inifinites"" If you don't limit the block size, then miners most will whatever is most profitable for them. And if that means a huge block, it will be a huge block. We must build a system that is robust in the face of adversities, not rely on good behaviour. Maybe you're right... but what if you're not. Again like playing Russian roulette, when it's too late, we can't go back. We fucked up.

&gt;But as I said in my previous I don't think bitcoin as used worldwide will have an empty mempool because of the fee floor imposed by the costs of mining hardware and operating costs.

So you're relying on miners to impose fees? Well, if the end state are miner imposed fees, why not have it with a block size limit. I want miners out of the equation as much as possible. Miners are ""user's bitches"". They provide a service, and get paid for it. End of story. They are ""crypto accountants"". If miners can determine fees, doesn't that sound a lot like banking to you? Who, after all, determines fees in traditional banking? We'd be at the mercy of the miners, and that's something we should steer away from as hard as possible - Users are in control, not miners. As it should be.


&amp;nbsp;

Will continue with part 2 tomorrow... it's getting late for me!

The idea is that with a higher velocity of money, you need less supply of money to meet demand (for a given amount of economic activity). It's technically true.

"The central issue is how they could possibly identify a transaction as good or as a double spend. Every miner would need to agree on this, otherwise half the network would believe tx A was the good one, while the other half would believe it was tx B. We don't need malicious miners for this to happen. Every miner could be honest and anyone could still break the network in half with 2 versions of the same transaction. This network segmentation already happens with the current first-seen rule. For this to be a feasible solution, we would need everyone converging on the same true state (everyone agreeing tx A is the good one, so dump tx B), which is the definition of consensus. We can't have consensus before a block is mined. Please read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8bsi94/why_the_coingeek_pledge_to_improve_instant/dx9ujpo/).

&gt; A minority miner trying to get blocks with obvious double spends added to the blockchain can be orphaned by the rest

Sorry, but you can't simply start orphaning a block just because this half of the network thinks it includes a double spend. One half of the network would orphan a block from the other half and vice-versa, it would just stall the blockchain.

Please explain me this. Satoshi worked really hard to solve the double spend problem, he knew that the the first-seen rule was not enough and actually proposed solutions to mitigate the risks. If there was such obvious low-hanging fruit like this, do you really believe he just failed to think about it? Or that in his 4 years working in bitcoin he would have thought and discarded any idea like this?",1523582348

&gt; As Sir Ian observed, the 80MM for the team still has not moved. we did not burn any of those... If $7.5M profit in the very first quarter is bad to some people, then I recommend those people to TRY to find other coins. haha

&gt; Your understanding of buy-back is from the stock market. You can't expect everything to work the same way in crypto. Or you might as well just keep trading stocks. You don't pay in stocks for commissions fees, for one.

&gt; Some of you guys need to stop this second-guessing and conspiracy theory stuff, or we may start to ""invite you out of the group"", as it is just generating unnecessary fud, and I have to spend time to respond.

&gt; We fulfilled all our promises from our white-paper, no delays, no adjustments, no excuses

&gt; We obviously collect most of our trading commissions in BNB and most of our other revenue are also only payable in BNB. We could sell them as we collect them, then do ""one-big-buy-wall"" on the market, or we could keep them do one big sell order and then buy it back with one big buy order. Or we could just keep all the BNBs we collect, do one withdraw to a wallet and burn it there. We could do any combination of the above.

&gt; The important thing is, the team portion has never moved. They still sits on the contract creators address. That's our reserve. We did not burn that. The BNB we burned are additional BNB we earned/bought/sold and then bought or however you like to call it. It's pretty simple.

&gt; Regarding the transaction history, we simply process this withdraw from a different cold wallet as the number is rather large. It's a wallet we don't use that often.

&gt; As most of our revenue is in BNB, when we have to spend fiat money, to buy some take outs for example, we could sell BTC or ETH we raised during our ICO, or BNB to BTC to fiat, or BNB to fiat directly on the OTC market, or any combination of the above.

"Most probably they don't relay double-spends, as only Bitcoin XT does it and I'm not aware of any miners running it.

Anyway, double-spend relaying is insufficient to reach consensus on which of 2 versions of a transaction is the first-ever-ever-seen or the double-spend. We can't reach consensus on which transactions are good by just communicating with each other: it took us 30 years to solve the double-spend problem in decentralized digital currencies and it required a true genius to realize proof-of-work and a nash equilibrium could do it. In bitcoin, consensus is reached _because_ of PoW, so only after a block is found. This is the reason a confirmed transactions takes precedence over an unconfirmed tx in the mempool, even if it's a blatant double-spend. To put it in another way: if nodes could reach consensus by just communicating, the mempool could be the definitive ledger and we wouldn't need blocks or miners or PoW.

Double-spend relaying is great for merchants, though. Since they can't know which transaction will effectively be confirmed, they can just bail out of the trade by not delivering their side.",1523578460

"That's a very simple view of the use case of a person getting into crypto today. Are you imagining they just want to get some crypto coins so they can spend it on coffees and t-shirts? And then push for adoption in Starbucks so they can spend it in there and then everywhere and then the coin maybe will be worth more? Because the first wave of Bitcoin adoption actually was not driven by coffee transactions, it was driven by the drugs trade in silk road, and the recent wave last December was driven completely by speculation and getting rich quick - I doubt users even made a wallet on their phone - they just bought and sold on an exchange without even touching any crypto.

LN I see more as an optional (for the user) and workable solution to a scaling debate, that is a solution to taking up space in the blockchain for transactions that don't really need to be on there, that it lowers fees to almost zero as well is just a pleasant side effect. It doesn't really need to function well today as long as it functions 10 years from now and lays the groundwork for people to use if they want to today. It's like asking why Bitcoin was needed 10 years ago if it didn't function well. Improvements in software take long long time, Rome wasn't built in a day.

It may be news to you but newbies don't really go into crypto today to make fast easy payments online or in coffee shops contrary to all the talk in this subreddit, we already have that solved and that is Apple/Android Pay, credit/debit cards, and cash money. Doesn't really matter how usable or faster another altcoin is when Bitcoin has the name recognition and first mover advantage. It's really not a choice that new users make getting into crypto today, they just choose the biggest coin. The removal of dependency of centralized banks is the real goal and shouldn't be overlooked by focusing too much on widespread coffee transactions, sure it would be great and it would increase its value, but never forget the real long term goal of why it exists in the first place.",1523576971

"One of the reasons Bitcoin came to exist was to allow transaction of value free from censorship and from corruption of centralised entities (governments, banks, etc). However, as Bitcoin's blockchain is completely transparent, censorship is possible using powerful data analysis tools. (You probably know all this).

The Monero Project is trying to fix some issues with Bitcoin (mining centralization, fungibility, financial privacy, amomg others).

There is ongoing development of a tool called Kovri which is a C++ I2P based garlic encryption and routing implementation. It will efectively hide your IP and all transaction data and I believe it will do it somewhat better than Tor because the data never leaves the I2P network. It is free and open source and will be integrated directly into the Monero software. IIRC alpha integration is scheduled for Q4 2018.

After this is implemented, there will be no way for ANY entity to track Monero users, miners or nodes. This is power to the people and true decentralization robustness.

Ofc, exchanges may be enforced to ban Monero trading, impairing the ability for people to buy it. This is not such a big problem with the emergence of decentralised exchanges and services that provide fiat-monero direct trading.

TL;DR - Kovri will make Monero impossible to ban. Decentralized exchanges and services will allow fiat onboarding.",1523576298

"I think most people view altcoins as eventual investments into Bitcoin - In which case, satoshi value is all that matters, since you are converting directly into BTC and do not care about the current dollar amount, assuming you will be trading into BTC ""sometime"" in the future, when it is worth more.

However, if you are trading direct into FIAT onramps for &lt;Currency of Choice&gt;, the currency of choice is what you want to look at.

If Bitcoin is going sideways, this can make a difference, because your satoshi value can go down more than the value goes up (Say you had an oversold day where the SAT value dropped 4%, and Bitcoin went up 2% - You would definitely be losing money) - But on days where Bitcoin goes crazy and the alt rises with it, you're still making money.

Now, a lot of people didn't see it (since they weren't around in 2017) but there are exceptions to this as well - When Bitcoin is rising SO much that people are actually selling their alts (Decreasing their sat value) to buy Bitcoin (Increasing Bitcoin's value).

In this scenario, Bitcoin's value goes crazy and alts plummet, because they are being sold off to increase the value of the thing they're trading for, a double whammy.

"
&gt;Your analysis is **only** valid in the extremely atypical case that a user has one and only one channel with outbound capacity, and that channel is public.
&gt;

How, mathematically, is adding another outbound channel going to help?  Another ""pat"" can do the same thing to that channel too (or the same pat can do the same thing to both channels).

Lesson 2 in the first graph theory class in university that anyone takes explains how topolgically adding more parallel links between nodes is the same as just increasing the weight on a single link between those nodes.  Lesson 3 is about how throughput problems that exist on subnets can't be solved in the general case by simply adding more nodes unless you make the graph complete.

The better solution is obviously, as you said, to never route and never make any channels public...but if everyone does that then the ""network"" isn't functional anymore.

&gt;The reason users will have more than one public channel is because they can collect routing fees for doing so. If there are few public channels, fees will be higher. If there are many public channels, fees well be lower.

If routing exposes me to the risk of needing to fund 1 (or 2, or 3 or...) onchain transactions in order to fund the channels that I need to actually spend my money in the way that I want, then my fee will be (estimated fee of those on-chain transactions+the value of my hassle).    If profiting from the fees is the economic incentivr to offset the risk of being compelled to make an on chain transaction, then I MUST charge more than the fee of an on chain transaction in order to not route at a loss.  Nobody will do this.

Besides, having more than two channels open is *currently* unsustainable at scale: from the lightning network whitepaper itself:

&gt;ralized processors.
If all transactions using Bitcoin were conducted inside a network of
micropayment channels, to enable 7 billion people to make two channels
per year with unlimited transactions inside the channel, it would require
133 MB block

Having two or less routed channels open is not only likely, it's the *suggested* operating mode of the network *in the whitepaper*


&gt;As the barrier to entry is extremely low, 

2+potentially N onchain transactions, per channel, per merchant is a very high barrier to entry even when on chain fees are only $0.25.

Plus the barrier to entry from watchdog trust and software usability and adoption, none of which we've touched here.

&gt;there should be nearly perfect competition, keeping fees as low as is sustainable.

As ive pointed out, this scenario means that the cost of an on chain transaction+the value of your time times the liklihood of someone routing through you is a floor on the price that is sustainable.

&gt; and the information about the network nearly perfect

How is information about the network nearly perfect if, as you've already admitted in this thread, there's no incentive to keep your channels public if you actually need to be able to use your money?  Why would anyone share information about their local network topology under those circumstances?  How could information about the network be perfect?  That's even ignoring the fact that there's no mechanism described to disseminate or verify the validity of peer nodes claims reporting on the network topology.

"&gt; it is because satoshi relied upon his work as an inspiration to build bitcoin

Right but not all of it, others are there too.

&gt; he never suggested such a thing. he got pressed by garzik so he said the limit could be lifted ""if needed"". there is an ocean of difference.

Well that's just a matter of point of view. If he did not suggest that then why everyone you support now supported block size increase back then?

&gt; they were not in the consensus, but they were in the software. satoshi made them stronger by adding the limit to the consensus

The numbers say otherwise, all statistics show tremendous fall of bitcoin competitiveness and basically loosing its value to altcoins. I trust those values more than the hype.

&gt; they were not bitcoin devs... beck is not a coder at all... gavin was just the first and he is not the best dev in terms of technical skills.

Right and out of anyone Satoshi chose Gavin.

&gt; free to think that but it really sounds ridiculous when BCH is corporate sponsored by bitmain

First of all BCH has several different implementations and different sponsors. Unlike Core which is monolithic no matter which drapes you choose.

Second of all - yes some corporations and merchants are more for the Bitcoin as it was before 2013 not the mumbo-jumbo it is now.

However it doesn't mean that Bitcoin Cash is bought by Bitmain. Bitcoin Cash is born out of basic necessity, because Bitcoin Core stopped doing anything it was supposed to do as well as its devs.

If it wasn't Bitmain, it would be my corp, or some other. It was just a matter of time. /r/bitcoinfork was there and brewing long before Bitcoin Cash. All other devs tried to do it with consensus from the people who got the power over it but got censored (it was imho a very liberal and bad move).",1523572058

"An important aspect of value is that its relative. A bottle of fine wine could be worth hundreds of dollars for wine gourmets but me as a wine ignoramus wouldn't notice and would trade it for 3 cans of beer. Additionally the value of something depends on the exact circumstances: Pretty much everyone in the world knows what a US Dollar is and agrees that it has some value. But I would have a hard time to find someone in my midsize city in germany where I live when I wanted to buy a can of coke for $10. No one would sell it to me because Euro is the common currency. But back to BTC and its value: I value the 30 Exahashes/sec of security a lot. I value the relative decentralization a lot. I value a lot, that Bitcoin Core devs development is slow and painstaking. I value a lot, that BTC development withstood short term business needs.
And thats what makes BTC valuable _for me_. You may disagree like many in this sub do, but that is expectable because value is relative.",1523571513

The hard part is getting mass adoption, which Bitcoin core has. It's slowly bleeding away but time will tell if that bleeding will stop or just continue.

https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2icma3/to_some_of_us_this_is_christmas_come_early/cl0y27x/

Given last year's bubble I was wrong. I hadn't realised how much the first bubble was only reported and driven in tech circles and so I hadn't realised how much untapped potential there was for the next bubble.

On the other hand I'm not unhappy with my decision. I've never owned bitcoin but have been following it since it was around a dollar. My reddit account isn't that old though so proving I was there further back is more difficult. My reasons for not buying it however haven't changed too much over the years, but I guess most people would consider not buying or mining at least some back when PC mining could still do it to be a sob-story.

By buying alts with BTC, I'm betting on those alts to outperform BTC. So the current rise in fiat % across the board of alts is largely artificial - as few are acting independently from BTC. In order to accumulate more BTC, I should only sell alts that are outperforming BTC (20%+, for examples sake) that I anticipate will soon dip in price.
__________

If an alt's BTC value is even marginally in the green, yet down significantly in fiat - it would signify that the alt is only being propped up by the current increase in value of BTC. Hypothetically, if I anticipated a rise in BTC and the alt to continue to fall, I could sell my alt holdings and have my original BTC investment returned - ignoring the fiat 'loss'. Essentially, breaking even.


In conclusion, I should aim to increase my holdings in alts when BTC is on a downtrend - in those coins/tokens that I believe will remains steady or rise independently.",1523570316

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2icma3/to_some_of_us_this_is_christmas_come_early/cl0y27x/

Given last year's bubble I was wrong. I hadn't realised how much the first bubble was only reported and driven in tech circles and so I hadn't realised how much untapped potential there was for the next bubble.

On the other hand I'm not unhappy with my decision. I've never owned bitcoin but have been following it since it was around a dollar. My reddit account isn't that old though so proving I was there further back is more difficult. My reasons for not buying it however haven't changed too much over the years, but I guess most people would consider not buying or mining at least some back when PC mining could still do it to be a sob-story.

Nick Szabo is only mentioned in the paper. He did not write the paper. And his project failed. Satoshi's project is world renown.

Without Satoshi - Nick Szabo wouldn't be world renown person.

SO we are not discussing whatever the heck Szabo did. It's his problem.

We're discussing what happened on the forums. And what actually happened is that Satoshi set the limit temporarily, otherwise he wouldn't suggest to increase it later. He had no limit in the beginning so we can safely say he was against limits at all, it was a necessarily evil at that moment.

Satoshi disappeared so only thing we can look at is his whitepaper and comments. And truth is in 2013 the whole narrative was different and when everyone put the money in Sidechains where sidechains with all their payment channel mumbo-jumbo and bitcoin was bitcoin and should've stayed that way.

Now it is important that Satoshi didn't choose Szabo or Beck to lead the project. He chose Gavin. And now because of mistakes in giving keys to Van Der Laan we are in this shit. Would he had not any keys Bitcoin would have 32MB blocks by now or maybe even went unlimited.

"I'm a fan of BCH, but you seem to be reversing causality.

In most historical cases, commodities that have been chosen as money do function a  store of value first, and also have other features that make them particularly well-suited to be a medium of exchange and unit of account. That's not the part that the BTC crowd is wrong about.

A house, a piece of gold or silver, salt, diamonds, artwork, fine wine, a pack of cigarettes, a can of sardines and a barrel of oil can all store value (to varying degrees of effectiveness and longevity) even if they are not used as a medium of exchange. 

All these things have a use case other than as money that gives them their value, and therefore, their ability to store value. Some of them have other properties that make them suited to be money, some of them don't.

Bitcoin Cash is unique in that its use value *comes from* its effectiveness as medium of exchange and data transmission. 

And so its value is, in a  sense, *derived from* its use in exchange. (Whether this will allow it to work as a stable store of value remains to be seen. But it's plausible.)

What makes Bitcoin Core unique is that *it has not use case* and therefore *it has no value to store*.

BCH is a GREAT medium of exchange and may or may not become a stable and reliable store of value.

BTC is a TERRIBLE medium of exchange and has no value to store.

BTCers are not wrong that the store of value function *usually* comes before the medium of exchange function, historically speaking. What they are wrong about is that they go on baselessly asserting that their broken token has any use value to store! :) ",1523569586

If a miner starts doing this regularly, other miners and members of the community should publicize that a miner is dishonest and put pressure on them to stop. Orphaning blocks is just one way to try to stop this. Legally, if a miner is engaged in deliberate double spending they are guilty of a crime, and there is signed cryptographic proof of them doing it in the blockchain. That could be one way of discouraging it.

Another incentive is simply what will happen to the price and the network. Doing this hurts the value and usability of bitcoin. I can't imagine anyone who has put millions of dollars into mining equipment is going to hurt their investment like this, over a few measly double spends.

"In Stocks and Cryptos we're comparing apples and Vacuum Cleaners. Neither is comparable to the other in any way other that you can buy them, they serve different purposes entirely. A stock is fully backed by a financial system, pays dividends, and is backed by the company - A crypto is based solely on the blockchain and whatever people perceive as its value. It doesn't have shareholders (Well, most don't) or investors to answer to for token prices.

We'll have to agree to disagree on the approach to take I guess - Not trying to squash the fact you think SUB is not a good project (Trend towards agreeing with you there, anyways) I just think in a wild west market, telling people not to invest tends to have the opposite effect.

I remember a fellow that was trying to tell people that ONT cannot be trusted and gave a full list of why not. I think this was a couple weeks ago.  I mentioned to him this would give people the opposite impression entirely, and that people would instead invest for this exact reason - I was looking for the comment.

"This isn't a traditional loan. The *bank* is giving you a way to access funds you normally wouldn't have. You will pay them back one way or another. The way it benefits you as the trader is if the price dips. They loan you a certain amount of bitcoin and you sell it, with you hoping that you will be able to buy it back cheaper when the price falls. You get to keep the difference in profit and then you return the loaned bitcoin to the bank. If you succeed, the bank loses because the bitcoin is now worth less than when they gave it to you. On the other hand, if you fudge the change in price and it goes up instead of down, you *STILL* have to buy the bitcoin so you can return it to the bank. The difference is that you have to use all of the money you made from selling the bitcoin, plus you have to fork over your own money to buy back all the bitcoin you were loaned to return it to the bank. In this scenario the bank wins and you lose, because they get the bitcoin back and it's now worth more than when they gave it to you.",1523567642

"When you short bitcoin (or any asset for that matter) you borrow bitcoin from the exchange and sell it. You have to repay that borrowed bitcoin eventually, but you hope that you can buy it at a cheaper rate to repay the loan. In a nutshell, you profit based on the amount of the price drop.

If the price rises, it costs more to repay the loan than you borrowed. Example:
- you short 1 BTC @ $7k
- price rises to $7.5k
Now, to repay the loan of 1 BTC, you have to spend $7.5k, but you only got $7k from the short sell. So you take a loss of $500.

If the price keeps rising, you lose even more money. This is what they mean when they say that your losses with shorting can be unlimited. If you short 1 BTC @ $10k &amp; the price jumps to $100k tomorrow, you need to come up with another $90k  to repay the 1 BTC you borrowed.

TL;DR:
So basically person A saw a price jump, and decided to cut their losses. They placed a market buy to recover the bitcoin they owe. This caused the price to increase a bit, and person B ended up in this same scenario due to the price jump caused by person A. Rinse &amp; repeat until there’s no one left with a short position who’s scared of the price jump.",1523566490

Ven's da bomb that's why. U.S. Government might seize it just because they can someday. Crypto is risky. ,1523566246
"Gambling is also about reckless abandon and disrespecting the risk. Good investors know that the most important thing isn't to get rich quick, and taking ridiculous ""high risk, high reward"" approaches. The rich are rich because they don't lose money and they don't lose their head when it comes to their investments. They specifically look out for things and factors that could fuck them up, they ask questions and dig deep looking for any kind of information, especially information about stuff that could undermine their investment. A good, rich investors don't ask first ""how much would I gain from this?"" but instead ask themselves ""What could go wrong? What if I'm wrong? What else I don't know?"" etc. etc. and do everything they can to not lose money first and foremost.

In this regard many crypto speculators fail because they are often afraid of the ""FUD"" and shun away critique or scepticism towards their favorite projects. Regular investors don't do that because they know it is stupid and dangerous to be emotionally invested in something. When you start investing you leave emotions at the door. Fools who literally marry their coins are subjecting themselves to the risk of emotional rollercoasters and are shooting themselves in the foot right from the beggining. Hell, many of them don't even recognize the fact that they're not investing, they're speculating. Currencies aren't investments but they still can be speculated on.

""Take the risk and if it you lose, oh well"" isn't an investment approach. I don't care how long term or short term is the scope of this bet on the bitcoin future. Investing is about mindset. ""go big or go home"" is not an investor mindset. It's a get rich quick yolo gambler mindset and the gutter is full of these fools. And don't get me wrong, there are speculators in this space who know the drill and don't suck whales' dicks whenever they decide to wipe out naive idiots but then again those guys have experience and average ""crypto investor"" is an unsophisticated amateur who starts in the most ravenous, unrestricted and unstable market there is.",1523566233

I dont care if BTC goes down, as long as I'm making good trades to accumulate more BTC.  So at the end of the day, there is enough information in those excel spreadsheets for me. I do agree that they need a way to export all trades as CAD or USD (not just in BTC values), however the entire website is really based in BTC, not fiat.  This is pretty obvious given that in order to purchase BTC using a limit order, you need to ""sell"" CAD, rather than ""buy"" btc, as the pair is CAD/BTC.  It is the same as buying or selling one coin for another.  Most people are used to seeing BTC/CAD ($9690) rather than wrapping their heads around CAD/BTC (0.00010182).  Maybe its the other way around, but you see my point. As someone who wants crypto to succeed, you should be excited at the idea of valuing things against BTC, rather than FIAT.  It would be just as hard to calculate taxes/gains if you were trading stocks and options based on the value of Gold rather than USD/CAD, because we don't pay our taxes in Gold.

"&gt; Okay, so I give you $1 to fund a channel to me with $100, in case somebody wants to give me a tip. And this is done atomically, guaranteeing the channel will be created in exchange for my payment.

I think maybe there was a misunderstanding. You would open a channel with me, pushing $100 worth of Bitcoin to my side. In that same transaction, I would pay you $99 worth of Bitcoin. Or, functionally equivalent, I open a channel with you and fund it with $99 of my BTC, and in that same transaction you pay me $100.

In either case, once the channel is open, I own all the funds in it.

&gt;How do I know that you're actually well connected? What if I pay you, the channel is made, but you're just not connected to the rest of the network well enough that anybody can actually pay me?

Well then I've just got paid $1 to lock up $100 in a useless channel. I can only collect fees if I actually route payments. You can also examine the channel graph to only make this offer to nodes that are well connected enough for your liking.

&gt;What if circumstances change? Eg, what if the people you were connected to go away? You didn't do anything, but now you've been cut off, while our channel is still there.

Same as above. Maybe I'll find new connections, or maybe I'll close my channel with you and you'll find a more well connected node.

&gt;What if you run a rogue node that refuses to forward transactions?

Then everyone else will close their channels with me.

&gt;How do I know you're actually stable? What if you go down for hours periodically? That would make it impossible for me to get paid at those times.

Nobody said you should have one channel and one channel only.

&gt;Do I have any guarantee that you'll actually keep the channel up for the agreed month?

No.

&gt;I would need to hedge my bets by establishing such a relationship with multiple nodes, just to be sure, and keep an eye on the ones that I'm working with to see if they're still performing.

Your node can do all of this automatically.

Particularly if your node has outgoing channels as well, you'll find that other nodes will open channels to you on their own. I have a node that randomly opened a channel with me for the maximum amount possible, 2^24 satoshis, about $1000.",1523565283

"Are you mining or are you not?  I purchased my first S9 and realized there was no way o could run it from the comfort of my own home.  Too loud, too hot and too much electricity.  We had to invest in a facility.  Like me, there are not a lot of people who can help support the mining network,  in their own houses. Therefore, instead of buying a miner and having to worry about its operation, they can pay for a service to support the mining network by having it run at our facility.  A 10% management fee for us to maintain, reboot and cool the miner is all we see in profit.  We also foregoing and investment in the coin.  From a business model standpoint, it helps us by increasing our up front cash flow to pay for utilities, which is why we have made cloud mining available as a product.  The word scam gets tossed around so much in crypto (for legitimate reasons), but people often forget that business models profit by providing value.

The exact same thing is going to happen around the 7700 price level. We're right on the downtrend that has been in place since January. The line is right around 7800. If break through that, stops will get triggered and shorts get liquidated. If we fail to break it, we're going back to $6k. 

I'm currently shorting BTC at 7750. If we close a one hour candle above 7850, I'm going to close my position. I don't think this will happen and I'll ride it down to 6k.

"&gt;How is looking at your post history not verification that a large part of your posts are either praising Dash or fuding Monero? It's just facts there to be seen by anyone.

Because that is not the definition of FUD for one. 

&gt; You were shadowbanned, yet still there you were, posting the same spam on the same account.

There's more than one way to shadowban someone. And its not spam, spam is content that is meant to be blasted repeatedly, outside of reposting points that I made that your community vote-brigaded beyond visibility, I rarely if ever post the same content in different threads. That's twice now you've played fast and loose with the definition of terms. FUD was wrong and now spam.

&gt;There is no proof that Fluffy did anything consciously to make this happen. It's speculation and accusations. Price movement is not proof of your claims.

There is proof that fluffy 

1. preannounced an 'announcement'.

2. LOL'ed when he revealed there was no announcement.

Again, this is established, verifiable history. You can read the tweets yourself. The fact that you're defending even this makes your motives more clear however. There is **nothing** that he could say or do that would make you change your mind. I wonder why that is?

&gt;Yet the numbers used in the research are those based on ""TXOs available, excluding RingCT"".

No, the numbers used **in that column** have that restriction, but the report makes clear in **several places** that RingCT doesn't really mitigate the problem and indeed, monero is still 45% traceable TODAY, RIGHT NOW.

&gt;Oh you mean like the fact that Evan instamined a big part of the supply in Dash

Source? Even if what you said were true, its not, how does Evan holding the largest amount of Dash hurt Dash? Satoshi holds plenty of bitcoin, Vitalk holds plenty of Eth, so why would this be an issue?

But the fact is that Evan wasn't the only one mining that day and those coins were dumped on exchanges very shortly after the fast-mine for pennies on the dollar. There was no way of knowing Dash would blow up as it has. And finally, the community voted against restarted the network as it would've been unfair to those who already got their coins. Anyway, this is water under the bridge for four years now. It has NO effect on Dash today and it had a POSITIVE effect on Dash back then (much more rapid liquidity/distribution than otherwise). Monero on the other hand, has a flaw that makes its transactions traceable 45% of the time, shouldn't you be worried about that?

&gt;challenging being the key word, hardly impossible. Call it what you want to make it sound better, it is still mixing and it completely ignores the conclusion:

Did you not read:

&gt;signicantly hurt the accuracy of the attack in practice. 
?

&gt;
""This is a significant weakness of mixing as an anonymity tech-nique. In this section we provide evidence that Dash, a cryptocurrency designed with mixing in mind, is susceptible to this attack"".

You're just reposting the beginning of the report, but the same report at the end invalidates its own claims by stating clearly that actual practical use **significantly** hinders the attack, of course because the attack DEPENDS on extreme edge case usage. 

https://www.dashforcenews.com/blocksci-paper-highlights-blockchain-traceability-issues-potential-future-risks-dash/

&gt;Such an attack is therefore rendered inaccurate by typical wallet use by having a **balance that was composed of multiple transactions.** Additionally, the study found that analysis was not effective in attempting to **de-anonymize previous transactions**, saying that “Evaluating the attack on **existing PrivateSend transactions is challenging.**”

So the two main flaws with your claim are 

1. Its almost impossible to find someone who uses their wallet for only one transaction, i.e. it never happens. 99.9% of people send/receive multiple transactions per wallet.

2. Even then, the attack ONLY WORKS on privateSend transactions that have just taken place. Previously mixed funds REMAIN unaffected.

In other words, this paper was rightly shown to be a non-issue. Monero on the other hand, will never be used as a privacy currency again shortly.

&gt;And still there are a whole bunch of wallets to chose from, no one is forcing anyone to use that wallet.

This is only true recently, for the vast majority of monero's history it was use that or use CLI. Monero's user experience is absolutely horrible on the CLI and just bareable with mymonero. 

&gt; So some guy makes a ""bad"" wallet for Dash and that is the fault of Dash then? 

If it was the lead f@cking developer of Dash it would! Are you freaking serious right now? How far up this man's @nus are you guys willing to go? That's a long way to go for a date my friend...

&gt;That is your interpretation of it, not any verifiable truth to it. Sounds more like he hurt your feelings since you focus so much on him.

Again, all I've stated is public record.

&gt;Bytecoin is and was a scam, that has nothing to do with Monero. 

Except Monero is a fork of bytecoin and inherited everything about the coin. Saying that it 'has nothing to do with monero' is thus a bit disingenuous don't you think?

&gt;This does not make Monero a scam or in any way mean that ""Monero started from scammers"". 

But the original developers of monero after the fork deliberately released a crippled miner so they could cheat and scam the community. Vitalk did a fascinating write up of it.

&gt;Oh so one or a few members of the community are assholes, what does that even mean?

Idk about you, but the Monero community is the *only community*, especially from that era before ICOs, that I can think of that has ever impersonated a public figure online in an attempt to shill their coin. When you think of PIVX, Dash, BCH, even LTC, you don't think, wow those guys are totally ok with impersonating other people for their own gain, and then defending those who get caught. 

What kind of people do you have to be to behave that way? Sure you say its 'just a couple of guys', but I can't find any posts in the monero sub that are the opposite of that. I can find plenty that have that same tenor though. 

&gt;you lie and manipulate almost every day in an attempt to shill Dash,

Challenge, show me one post I've made, with quotes that has either a lie or attempted manipulation, let alone either of those in an attempt to shill Dash. My post history is open, go ahead. We've got time. 

&gt;Disputed, non peer reviewed research by a competing coin that is backed by government and big data. 

Disputed by whom? The monero community who have a vested interest in you not knowing their privacy model doesn't work and NEVER did? Non-peer reviewed?? Its being presented at a conference this July. Competition is fine, you guys have NO PROBLEM criticizing Dash even though you're a 'competing coin'. I guess what's good for the goose is good for the gander, probably shouldn't have based your community around being giant flaming assholes to everyone. That paints a target on your back I guess *shrug*.

&gt;don't say that Monero is traceable because ""research is out there"" when the same can be said about your favorite coin, only to say ""nah that research doesn't count""

"First,  thank you for taking the time to explain all this. You may want to hire an academic-rambling-to-laymen-terms translater to summarize your articles in the future (with citations to the original proof of course).  I feel &gt;90% of readers in this sub would be instantly lost without it.  A time series animation would be great too.

Why is it necessary for the mempools to be exactly the same? My understanding of bitcoin is that transactions propagate to all miners very quickly so they would be nearly the same. Does coingeek not relay the doublespend? (Because it's a doublespend?)  Relaying the doublespend seems sufficient as a replacement for the missing communication you mentioned.",1523564690

I agree, if someone bought two days ago and sold today they would still see a nice profit even with a short term capital gains tax.

Hopefully, I can hang onto Bitcoin until after there is some sort of capital gains exemption legislation.",1523564658
"Yeah it is, but what’s the little guy going to do about it 😂. I’ve been trading, mining, investing in crypto since 2013 and it happened to me.

""Right, so you have $200 worth of BTC total in cold storage. You want to do a a series of transactions today so you fund your hot wallet with $100. Half way throughout the day, you now want to do a $120BTC. What now?""
Now, this would then go to say LN is the preferred way of transacting between others. Why would you not head in that direction?",1523564574

"I don't think we've reached saturation either. I work with a group of women a bit younger than me (they're all early/mid 20's). A few of them had heard of Bitcoin prior to the December frenzy but had no idea what it was. I consider myself somewhat internet/tech savvy - at least more than the average person and I had no idea what blockchain was. I'd heard of Bitcoin but didn't know hardly anything about it other than a vague understanding of the old Silk Road stuff. I literally had no idea there were even any cryptos OTHER than Bitcoin until December of last year when I first got into this stuff. 

I went to lunch with one of these girls the other day and she asked me ""so how's your internet money doing?"" lol. So yeah.. I think that about sums up the general public's thoughts on cryptos. 

I'm sure many millennials in sort of tech-ish sector professions have heard of cryptos, but I would definitely say the average person - even the average young person - still has no idea about it other than having heard of Bitcoin itself hitting $20k. ",1523564117

In light of that it's actually rather mysterious for me why IOTA has still a pretty low market cap.

"The party sending can fund to open a channel, no need for the receiver to own any BTC beforehand.",1523563699
"Lastly I will say that correlation and causation are very different things, as is correlation and prediction. Knowing two variables correlate does not mean you can predict one from the other, particularly if predicting delta is what is important.

For example, if you have a function which is a moving average of white noise then you will have good correlation at certain lags but your ability to predict x(t+1) relative to x(t) is still zero.

So for example I can predict that tomorrow bitcoin will be between 6k and 9k, and my prediction is made more accurate by knowing today's price. (I would not have made the same prediction a year ago with the price below $1k!), but I cannot predict with any accuracy which direction it will move.

Nobody using the Substratum network will even come in contact with crypto as it is free. Only those hosting on the network and the nodes will ever see the SUB coin.

"It would take much more investigation than I have the time for... but to cause a short squeeze that large, multiple positions got liquidated. The liquidation limit is based on the amount of leverage and the amount in each position. So each position could have a different percent loss before the position gets liquidated. Either a person or a coordinated effort simply had to buy enough to raise the price high enough (My guess is at $7k many positions got liquidated) to start the chain reaction.

"Wrong on many levels.

A transaction does not take 10 minutes, it is posted globally in a few seconds.  It _confirms_ in 10 minutes (assuming next block).  I have never once had a merchant make me wait for a confirmation.  Similarly, when I use a credit card, the merchant doesn't make me wait for that transaction to confirm.  Posting != confirmation.

Current payment systems are centralized, and orders of magnitude slower.  For instance, I can send funds to my friend overseas by only knowing his address.  Through centralized banking or remittance services, that would go through layers of banks and services, each taking a sizeable fee. 

Also, permissionless, decentralized and psuedo-anonymous are all qualities that have value to me that I can't find outside of crypto.

Finally, don't forget that the current fiat system is prone to inflation at the hands of central banks.  With crypto, math governs the rate of inflation (if any) and is known to all.

This caused many that tried to adopt it in 2017 get back out, as well as nearly all merchants that previously accepted BTC.  From the public's eyes, it looks like ""Bitcoin doesn't work.""

"Situation in Zimbabwe is:
There's no real currency in circulation, bond notes are being used (only valid within the country). 
However, the problem with that is Zimbabwe is heavily dependent on imports because most industries closed down or significantly downsized (from food, textiles, electricity, you name it) therefore, there's need for lot of international payments to be made to access basic goods and services... but with what money since the country is not exporting??

Now, had we been exporting as much as we are importing, then it would have sort of balanced out because only then would we have foreign currency.... but as it is, we don't. As a result, USD have been gold.

 So the big deal with this Bitcoin ATM is that it's the only one that has the so much needed USD.

&gt;**Visa – 1,667 transaction per second**

&gt;Visa told MyBroadband in 2016 that VisaNet processes an average of 150 million transaction each day, or around 1,667 transaction per second on average.

&gt;“Based on rigorous testing, we estimate that VisaNet is capable of processing more than 56,000 transaction messages per second,” said Visa.

I sort of take issue with that statement. As far as I can see core has put all the scaling eggs in the LN basket. Making on chain fees prohibitively expensive due to artificial limitations removes choice and is a form of censorship. All of the dust and low balance wallets that can no be consolidated due to them being lower than fee thresholds has been and will again be an issue even if fees are low at the moment. Would it even be possible to get that money onto LN in the first place? (by sweeping a private key directly or something similar?)

"No, banks are dreadfully slow to innovate with all the red tape and government-set hoops they have to jump through. I don’t think banks will be the bane of cryptocurrencies because their time to outcompete has long passed. 

As far as my predictions for crypto in a few years, I think that we’ll start seeing a lot more currencies that improve more on the consumer side of things instead of the tech. A lot of these coins that we see now have pretty outstanding projects but are utterly useless when it comes to what currencies are supposed to be used for, a simple and easy way to exchange value. I think that outside of BTC and ETH, the top 50 coins will be replaced as there’s always a way to build a faster, more efficient coin, and usually as a market matures more talented people enter to create far better projects. 

That being said, I personally don’t invest in the technology as much as I invest in the people behind it. And by that, I don’t mean the amount of ex-Amazon or ex-Google employees a particular team has on their LinkedIn, but the team’s proven ability to adapt in their market. Amazon started as a book store, Google was an open-line search engine, GroupOn was for protests, YouTube started as a dating site, and Facebook was for universities. The thing about all of these companies was that they changed their vision over time because the market started to change as well. For a lot of these companies, they wouldn’t have survived dotcom bubble without those adaptations. In the crypto space, I’ve only seen a few teams that have shown this ability, and all of them have a smaller market cap, but they are definitely my front runners for the long term. Additionally all of my front runners have at least built some sort of Alpha, and the Alpha is usually flawed, but it shows that they are going on the direction of trial and error. Not promise and deliver. Which is what I see in almost all of the coins that are highly shilled now.

"The SEC chairman stated in a Senate hearing that all ICO's/cryptos are securities, not just some.  But, please keep in mind that the f'ing SEC does NOT make law and they don't have the authority to decide that a token or coin is a security. No one in government is stopping them at the moment, however.  Congress has publicly deferred making any decisions on how to treat cryptos which has allowed 11 different gov't. agencies to try to claim cryptos as their territory with SEC leading the pack.  

Existing U.S. securities laws are outdated and extremely cumbersome (1940's era) so there's every reason to believe law makers will make new, streamlined legislation that is suitable for new technology. They are going to want to accommodate innovation to make sure it flourishes in the U.S.  Dragging their feet, though, is allowing the SEC too much leeway ATM. The FBI should be the interim law enforcement IMO. Too many in crypto space are asking ""how high?"" when the SEC says ""jump"". Too many crypto investors are letting their lawyers go running to the SEC crying ""they issued an unregistered security"" if anything goes wrong.  That's not helping.

So, in answer to your question, no true authority out can label a token a security but until all that gets sorted out, use Binance.

How do you short a Bitcoin? Is there a market that does this?,1523559152
"
&gt; Our current system doesn't really allow most people to save up enough money to buy a house without going into debt or waiting for 30 years. With a better form of money like Bitcoin it would take much less time though

you haven't explained why this would be unless you think bitcoin is going to have an indefinitely higher growth rate than any other form of asset.

The S&amp;P 500 has grown 9.8% a year over the last 90 years, which is about the highest rate of return any investment has had over such a long time period. If that wasn't high enough for people to just save for homes instead of borrowing for them, how high do you think bitcoins growth rate is going to be over that kind of time period? 15% a year? 20%? How long do you think it can sustain that growth rate?

&gt;By holding onto your coins you are adding human value to the network and make it a little bit bigger

How does the network know the difference between a coin that is being ""hodled"" and a coin that has just been lost and is never going to be spent? How does a coin doing nothing sitting on a paper wallet somewhere help the network anymore than coins doing nothing because their owners lost them and can't recover them?

&gt;Sure I invest into projects I find valuable like Lightning, is there any reason why you're assuming I just sit on my coins and do nothing with them?

You've talked about ""hodling"" and using bitcoin for savings, and you can't have money in savings and invested in businesses at the same time.  If you had all your bitcoin tied up in investments then you wouldn't have any bitcoins, you'd have % of businesses you bought with bitcoin, and those businesses would then use those bitcoin to grow their business.

If your goal is to help bitcoin and not become rich then you would accomplish that better by investing that money in projects that are trying to make bitcoin more usable than just sitting on coins for years waiting for them to go up in value.

&gt; I never recommend other people to put their entire savings in it, but a small percentage isn't a bad thing.

This contradicts the idea that its not about speculation. ""don't invest more than you can afford to lose"" is how people talk about gambling, not saving. If you're interested in saving you put it in the absolute safest place you can. You must think other things are safer than bitcoin if you think people should only put a small % of their savings in it.",1523559128

"&gt; I am still correct that at 1/3 you still want to mine honestly since you lose money during the initial changing of the difficulty since you mine blocks slower and since you mine blocks at an equal speed after difficulty adjusts with either strat you simply want to avoid the initial slowdown with the selfish strat.

Yes. Glad you did the math, though, for values over 1/3.

&gt; why the math works for SM as well as the topological reasons why it isn't a problem for BCH, but why it could be for BTC

You might want to temper this with the notion that the DAA in BCH adjusts **much, much faster** than BTC, so selfish miners can potentially profit much more quickly in BCH versus BTC, even if gamma is 0.

The nodes don't automatically trust the miners, the nodes have to verify the consensus rules to verify the miners. If the miners want to break the consensus rule, the honest nodes stop the breach from propagating.

Nodes are key to preventing miners from getting out of line. You vote on the consensus rules with your node.

"&gt; It's simply not reflected correctly in the market, as it really never is.

You are misrepresenting the argument of market cap, as they do in the article as well. 

If a 1000 coin OTC market order happens, it's typically because they are buying from someone who hasn't actively been trading their bitcoin. 

If a coin never changes hands, it doesn't actually affect the market price of bitcoin. It's the exact same everywhere - bond markets, equities, coins, CDO's, credit default swaps, and other exotic derivatives. 

This is why when trading stock, for instance, the float of shares outstanding is displayed in nearly every brokerage. It represents the % of shares that are liquid. If 70% of shares are part of the float, and a huge movement occurs in non-liquid shares, it doesn't really matter what someone paid for it, because the shares aren't released onto the market place. 

Same thing here. If a ""whale"" buys 100k coins, but they never enter the market place, and where never in the market place to begin with, the price wouldn't move at all.

"Yeah that was a terrible time to try to transact on the network. I spent over $20 to send some BTC in early December. However, I specifically asked about recent usage. Because here we are second quarter 2018. Yesterday I sent some BTC at the highest priority for $0.10.

Segwit is working as intended and had been adopted by the major exchanges. We'll have to wait until the next bull run to know for sure but I think the network is better equipped than it was at the end of 2017 to handle huge volume.

I'm not opposed to a block size increase. However you just have to look at the stats of BCH and the damn near empty blocks to know what increased blocksize isn't the only answer.

How I feel about people with 0 BTC,1523556366
"It took me a long time to realize that it's a bit more than that. But you're right - it's a science project; so is Bitcoin. Some projects are managed better than others.

It finally dawned on me a few days ago how Lightning fits into the whole narrative that's been evolving over the past five years. It seems like a long time but in retrospect it makes sense; only just now are we seeing the fruits of those plans. Lightning is indeed someone's pet project (maybe a few people) and, like all pet projects, is driven because that someone sees a potential in that project's success.

Most people think ""hurr it'll destroy bitcoin thats why"" and while that may appeal to the base conspiracy theorist in most rational coiners, that's actually dead wrong. You see, there's a key component of the narrative that often gets overlooked and slandered, and is rarely in focus.

That key is **fungibility** and what that means. You see, it's a required quality of a currency for it to be *fungible* - meaning, one unit is always equal to another unit. A dollar is worth any other dollar, so to speak. By that definition, one would say ""well Bitcoin is fungible then."" And you'd be mostly right.

However, the narrative surrounding *fungibility* echoes back to the early creations of altcoins - Monero in particular being originally founded to create a ""truly fungible"" coin in which it is impossible for a third party to determine where a coin's payment originates from. The idea is that since bitcoin is a public pseudonymous ledger, one can trace the movement of coins to their origin and thus identify specific coins as being ""tainted"" and therefore unacceptable for use - a drug dealer's dollar is *not* worth an honest citizen's dollar because it is at risk of being frozen! By this definition, Bitcoin is not fungible, and there were even early attempts by core-aligned individuals at coin blacklisting that never really took off. (See also: bitcoin knots)

So, the epiphany: *Lightning tries to make coins fungible by distributing taint*. The push for Lightning is an attempt to make Bitcoin fungible (by anonymity standards), not an attempt to destroy it. Should Lightning fail to accomplish this task, it will take Bitcoin down along the way. I expect the following videos to cover these topics in detail.",1523556338

"It was a Good exchange to watch, Ver was being professional in light of the failed transaction. Understanding how lightning works is so important for people. I know that most here on this thread probably already know, but for those who don't, it is a layer 2 that is controlled by 1 company blockstream. They have created payment channels that act as a single transaction on the main BTC network when opened. Once that channel is open you have a different address on the LN network in which you can do thousands of transactions, that never are recorded on the blockchain. Also, the transactions are verified/confirmed by a 3rd party blockstream. This is the same thing as having a digital bank. Besides the rules and regs, at the fundamental level, this is comparable to having visa approve my transaction at a grocery store, gas station, etc.. However, to be fair, I am providing the link that explains the lightning network. It is blockstreams video so there is no bias in the video other than their own.

"&gt;Sure does and it is easily verifiable.

This is true, but what you're saying is not verifiable. But again, anyone who looks will know I am correct.

&gt;Because I have been arguing with you regarding a Monero related issue for an entire page, don't act stupid. Anyone can see that you are just making things up here.

Except your posts weren't at all all directed at me.

&gt;Exactly, your post had claims but no verifiable edvidence.

But that's false, it did have verifiable evidence. Click on the links. You're the one who doesn't have any evidence. Gaslighting is a typical NLP technique, they do something to you then accuse you of doing that same thing to them. 

&gt;You claimed that he was doing a pump and dump and somehow I have to prove you wrong, ok typical mental gymnastics to baffle with BS. Your claim, you prove it.

Except there was no 'claim', he pumped the price with a preannouncement, then DUMPED the price with the news. There is nothing to claim, this is verifiable recorded fact.

&gt;Oh ok common knowledge, sounds like baseless accusations to me.

You apparently did not witness the events, what I'm describing is common knowledge to anyone who watched the event go down. Half the r/monero sub called for fluffypony's head for like a month and a half afterwards.

&gt;Yet the numbers are based on ""Monero transaction inputs where the real input can be deduced (1+ mixins,≥ 1000 TXOs available, excluding RingCT)""

No, not all of them, just those. But still, they claim that even with RingCT the original coin can be traced 45% of the time, still, to this day. If you truly cared about privacy, you would be advocating that people stopped using monero until this vulnerability was fixed, instead of trying to cover it up. 

Right? In the open source community, that's how we handle bugs. The whole point of having eyeballs-on-code is to be able to FIX BUGS when they are discovered and to be able to avoid the problematic behavior if necessary. But you guys are not like that, you actively advocate for people to use a privacy currency that YOU KNOW is not private. Why?

&gt;Yet here you are a Dash supporter doing your best to FUD Monero. 

Facts are not FUD, friend. If you have a privacy coin with broken privacy, pointing that out is not FUD, its good stewardship. That's like carlos matos calling reports about bitconnect being a scam 'FUD'. Oh wait, the parallels are striking. 

&gt;I claim that the Monero people are more competent and trustworthy than the ZCash people.

Except it was the ZCash people who brought this info out, not the monero people. So it stands to reason that, at least in analyzing the monero code, the ZCash people are more competent. FluffyPony P&amp;D'ed his own community, so idk, that's not very trustworthy to me. You may like losing thousands of dollars but, other people have different opinions on that matter.

&gt;""It also works against Dash, a prominent privacy-focused altcoin with built-in mixing""

&gt;""Our Bitcoin importer also works on Litecoin and Dash as they use the same format"".

&gt;""This is a signicant weakness of mixing as an anonymity tech-nique. In this section we provide evidence that Dash, a cryptocurrency designed with mixing in mind, is susceptible to this attack"".

&gt;""Dash’s PrivateSend uses CoinJoin-style mixing, whereas Monero uses mixing based on ring signatures and Zcash provides crypto-graphic untraceability, which is a stronger (and provable) anonymity property"".

At the end of their section on Dash:

&gt;In the above **experimental** setup, we started from a **single** premixing
address holding Dash. **In reality, users may obtain Dash
in multiple installments** and hold these coins in their wallet in a
manner **that is not easily linkable to each other** (Oh, REALLY? LOL). Relying on this is
unwise for privacy, as it is a form of security through obscurity ([thethrowaccount21]security through obscurity is called steganography and is perfectly fine to rely on for privacy so this shows a bit of a bias point here);
nevertheless, **it is a factor that will signicantly hurt the accuracy of
the attack in practice**. Evaluating the attack on **existing PrivateSend
transactions is challenging due to the lack of ground truth**, and is a
topic for future work.

In other words, the attack DON'T WORK IN REAL LIFE JACK!

&gt;In other words yes, it obscures the coins origin but it is not impossible to trace with blockchain analysis.

Nice try at poisoning the well, but the fact is the report itself states that the attack is SIGNIFICANTLY hindered by real world use, such as to be a NON-ISSUE. Nobody uses their wallets that way!

&gt;And so I conclude that I trust the people behind Monero alot more than the government/bigdata sponsored people behind Zcash.

Yet Monero's most popular wallet is closed-source on the backend and run by the lead maintainer of monero, fluffypony. Who, might I add, scammed his own community and has participated in unethical behavior several times and abused his position as lead maintainer of Monero. So it makes little sense in my mind to 'trust' them, especially when crypto is about not having to trust. The research is out there, traceability is a serious risk for Monero.",1523555650

"From what I am seeing watching the market and the order books you are leaving out one of the very obvious manipulation tactics that are clearly happening.

I'm not sure if you have noticed but there is definitely an individual or a group acting as a single entity manipulating the price by wash trading. (They are buying their own sell orders and selling their own buy orders to drive up the appearance of trade volume and manipulate the entire market price)
It's very obvious that this is happening on bitfinex by a user who seems to have control of somewhere between 60 and 120 million USD worth of BTC and fiat that is regularly being wash traded to manipulate the entire crypto price.

"At this point I'm going to just assume you are Beggs, as no one defends some else work so vigorously. 

Again, you are failing to see that bitcoin while is a commodity money, it is not just any kind of commodity money. The features that allow for bitcoin and other crypto assests to function over the internet with cryptography protecting it means that it is fundamentally a new kind of commodity-money. It functions on totally different economic axioms than classic commodity monies. 

&gt;How? Explain this in plain terms what exactly we're supposed to be looking forward to. 

We should be looking forward to using this technology to create our own inclusive economic and political syndicates; essentially anarcho-syndicalism via the internet. Through the expropriation of capital itself from the state, through the choice to abandon state fiat money and to use alternatives that are outside of their power, we destroy the very backbone of capitalism itself, while also creating the framework from which we can create a whole new form of politics leveraging the internet. 

It's pretty clear to me that you simply don't want to understand what this technology can do, and you just want to label it as some right-wing conspiracy. You seem to have made up your mind that it is bad, and that's fine, but stop acting like you know what you are talking about. This is a totally new piece of technology that is radically changing the world, and you are far from the first person to say that it is nothing new. They were wrong and so are you. 

&gt;I still don't understand what this means. What am I supposed to take from this?

Try googling bitcoin lightning network and see what you come up with.

&gt;But I will pose a question in turn: what do you have to say to the massive environmental costs of this so-called 'wave of the future'? Why is this ultra-futuristic 'disruptive' technology so addicted to good old fashioned coal for instance? Do you have a meme that explains that too or can you actually discuss corporeal matters?

The environmental cost are a concern and which is why there are other projects like Ethereum, Tezos, EOS, Decred, and many more which are all working on proof-of-stake systems, meaning they don't use electricity in the same way. There is good reason for the need for a proof-of-work system (the system that burns electrical energy to create bitcoin units), but I won't go into that now. [Here](https://btctheory.com/2013/12/28/the-barbarians-of-government/) is a more detailed post discussing some of these points at length.

If you can flaunt it then the other attendees can see that ""*youre* cool- *you* know how to do it. You're so crypto man."" This causes others to want one, even if they didn't before.
- The girls are incented to sell more, so the girls are happy to instruct the paper wallet holders how to download the Bitcoin.com wallet (or any wallet that supports in-wallet BCH purchase so they can get more), sweep the paper wallet, and send the girl the BCH to complete the sale.

just couple of days ago TA specialist mansion that bitcoin passing very crucial time either bitcoin break out either bitcoin break down based on TA looks like bitcoin break out,1523554867
"I can assure you that it becomes super annoying to use when the fees are constantly rising. I was actively using BTC during the late-2017 bullrun. Due to the fact that blocks were full and fees were rising every day, fee estimators in wallets were notoriously unreliable. So, with every transaction I made, I had to carefully check that the fees were appropriate for the current network conditions. Even with my careful manual checking, there were multiple times that I sent transactions with slightly too low of a fee, resulting in long wait times for confirmation. Ultimately, it came down to either significantly overpaying in fees, or risking my transaction being stuck for hours or even days.

The reality is that with full blocks, it's impossible to accurately predict what fee to pay to guarantee inclusion in the next block. You can make a best-guess based on current network conditions, but you cannot predict the future. If a block isn't found for much longer than 10 minutes, or if there is a sudden increase in transaction volume (e.g. due to a price jump), then it's possible for the minimum required fee to rise above whatever you paid. And, if the minimum required fee stays higher than whatever you paid - you're in for a long wait.

This is why BTC's vision of a forcing a fee market due to full blocks is deeply flawed. And every time there is a spike in transaction volume, this flaw will be exposed to all that use it.",1523554842
"Blackcoin (BLK)  $18m  

Blackcoin is basically the Linux of crypto. The perfect Proof of Stake project. Launched in 2014, in such a way that it ensures perfect dispersion, no premine, no ICO and no developer fees chipping away at the wallet distribution which is so essential to make a staking coin work. Every node stakes equal per coin that is owned. No master nodes, no delegates, everything accessible for whoever wants to get in on it. It's 100% community owned, nobody has unfair or undue leverage on this.  

And that's why it's going to excel this year. It's quite clear that there are two things that crypto is getting tired of:  
- Miner shenanigans  
- Teams underdelivering on decadent budgets  

Proof of Stake is the only thing that makes actual sense. The power to control a coin needs to be spread over as many hands as possible. The better it's dispersed the more stable and secure it becomes. Miners are either indifferent (like with BTC) or openly hostile (XVG, Monero) to the coin they're mining and token teams holding all the consensus have shown very little restrain in abusing that power to screw over their user base.   

However, Proof of Stake only makes sense if it's launched properly. If it has had enough entropy at the start and nobody is clinging on to extra power. Power is something that's notoriously hard to let go off in the crypto space. Every coin professing to be 'decentralized' is usually only decentralized on paper, somewhere in the future, unless of course, it is already spread out from the get go, like BLK.   

As for news, whereas Ethereum is trying hard to move to a PoS like model, BLK is working hard on getting their scriptable tokens running on their blockchain. The tokens can already be made by anyone due to a convenient interface option and full token functionality is what follows.

EOS uses Delegated Proof of State (DPoS). There are 21 nodes that confirm blocks - strategically located throughout the world. Since each node is delegated, stake holders (token holders) have the ability to vote in and out nodes. Is this as decentralized as Bitcoin, of course not. But does this greatly reduce the risk of a 51% attack, provide a censorship-proof and secure blockchain that is nearly infinitely scalable with zero transaction fees - YES. And as time has shown, Bitcoin miners continue to consolidate and more and more of the processing power is held in fewer and fewer hands. I personally believe that Delegation is the ONLY long-term solution since it's probably a little too optimistic to believe that millions of people throughout the world will be interested in continuously running their own node for years-on-end. As long as there is transparent blockchain governance that clearly defines how the nodes operate and are voted in and out of power, I simply don't understand the decentralization concern.

Sure does and it is easily verifiable.

&gt; Except every post on the first page of your comment history is about monero with 1 or 2 fudding verge, lmao

Because I have been arguing with you regarding a Monero related issue for an entire page, don't act stupid. Anyone can see that you are just making things up here.

&gt; 'Claims' and 'evidence' are not mutually exclusive, many claims are backed by evidence, many are not. But to dismiss my evidence because it is merely a 'claim' is disingenuous, especially so when I included sources in my post.

Exactly, your post had claims but no verifiable edvidence.

&gt; I don't have to, you have to prove that he didn't. Because if you don't then everyone has to trust not only your word, but that fluffy 'wouldn't do that'. Except he already did...and yet you guys still defend him. Hmmm, defending a scammer. Who does that kind of thing? Hmmm

You claimed that he was doing a pump and dump and somehow I have to prove you wrong, ok typical mental gymnastics to baffle with BS. Your claim, you prove it.

&gt; This is common knowledge. A reporter in the cryptospace posted to twitter that there would be a 'huge' announcement at a conference last year concerning monero. That means fluffy told him about it in advance. That is common knowledge.

Oh ok common knowledge, sounds like baseless accusations to me.

&gt; From their technical report:

Yet the numbers are based on ""Monero transaction inputs where the real input can be deduced (1+ mixins,≥ 1000 TXOs available, excluding RingCT)""

&gt;But Dash is not a competitor with Monero. You consider it to be, but in Dash it is not the same. If you go on the r/dashpay subreddit and search for threads about monero, there will be maybe 5-10x less than if you search for Dash on Monero's sub. Especially before a year or so ago, they really were hating back then. But Dash is for PoS (point of sale), micro,instant transactions with privacy as an additional feature, so you cannot make the claim that my support of Dash has anything to do with this, except for the fact that YOU are openly hostile to that community, and bud, that's definitely a you problem.

Oh trust me, I know. Dash is not a competitor, it's more of a get-rich-scheme if anything, definitely not a competitor to Monero. Yet here you are a Dash supporter doing your best to FUD Monero. contradicting yourself again. I have seen as little about Dash in the Monero sub as the other way around. There are bad feelings both ways, there is no denying it but blaming it on one side is just dishonest. You are proof of that yourself.


&gt; Apparently not if they could miss a fundamental flaw like that! Only Andrew Miller's research group has shown a 90% traceability until last year with a continuing 45% to this day.

Based on your view of who is right. I claim that the Monero people are more competent and trustworthy than the ZCash people.

&gt; Even the researchers who made that paper claim, IN THAT PAPER, that their exploit is unlikely to be deployable in practice because wallet usage patterns preclude it from working. Unlike monero's privacy issue, that was an edge case made on a copy of the dash network (used wrong denominations for starters) not the real one. PrivateSend remains, to this day, unbroken. With monero however, you have a 45% chance of having your coin traced.

Yea, see now you are doing exactly what you claim that the Monero community is doing.

""It also works against Dash, a prominent privacy-focused altcoin with built-in mixing"" 

""Our Bitcoin importer also works on Litecoin and Dash as they use the same format"".

""This is a signicant weakness of mixing as an anonymity tech-nique. In this section we provide evidence that Dash, a cryptocur-rency designed with mixing in mind, is susceptible to this attack"".

""Dash’s PrivateSend uses CoinJoin-style mixing, whereas Monero uses mixing based on ring signatures and Zcash provides crypto-graphic untraceability, which is a stronger (and provable) anonymity property"".


And yes you will point to the lines: 

""Evaluating the attack on existing PrivateSend transactions is challenging due to the lack of ground truth, and is a topic for future work"". This does not mean that it is impossible. The research also says: ""In reality, users may obtain Dash in multiple installments and hold these coins in their wallet in a manner that is not easily linkable to each other. Relying on this is unwise for privacy, as it is a form of security through obscurity;"" 

In other words yes, it obscures the coins origin but it is not impossible to trace with blockchain analysis. 

Pretty much the same result as a Bitcoin mixer would give you. (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.02489.pdf).

&gt; This is word spaghetti

Ok let me clear it up for you. ZCash is a for profit company that talks about tracking users, in bed with government, big data and the Blockchain alliance. Still they claim to be a privacy coin, something that is hard to believe since they work with the people or even are the people with direct interest in de-anonymizing cryptocurrency users. Hence we should not trust what they say. And so I conclude that I trust the academics behind Monero alot more than the government sponsored people behind Zcash.",1523553833

"#Project:

Chimaera - https://chimaera.io/ - hard cap under $30m

#Description:

Chimaera puts video games up to 100% on the blockchain. It facilitates:

* 100% fraud-proof trading and transactions, 
* Secure asset storage, 
* Enables games to create blockchain-based game currencies &amp; assets/items
* Play-to-earn game model with ""Human Mining""
* Original inventors of blockchain gaming - Huntercoin in early 2014
* Long history in crypto
* Solved scalability issues through Game Channels http://www.ledgerjournal.org/ojs/index.php/ledger/article/view/15/64
* You can build OASIS from Ready Player One with it
* Games no longer need servers
* 24/7 uptime
* Provably fair gameplay and items gives game assets real-world value as proven in Huntercoin
* And lots more...

#Why it will excel:

Chimaera is the only project of its kind. Its ability to put games 100% on the blockchain and enable play-to-earn gaming will attract gamers and game developers. 

What Chimaera aims to do simply CANNOT be done without a blockchain. It's not solving a problem that's been solved a thousand times before. 

""Human Mining"" is unique to Chimaera. The principle has been proven in Huntercoin, and earlier experiment designed to test the blockchain with a simple MMO game. 

# News

Chimaera has partnered up with several top game studios. So far 2 have been announced:

* https://chimaera.io/soccer.php
* https://chimaera.io/treat.php

Chimaera recently added Jon NEVERDIE Jacobs and Rudy Koch as advisors. 

It has been featured in numerous articles and languages and consistently rates highly in reviews.

Shorting:


Imagine I borrow your Playstation 4 to play some Last Guardian when the price of a PS4 is $300, but instead of playing games, I immediately sell it on Craigslist for $300. A week later, Sony drops the price to $250. I then buy you a new PS4 for $250, replacing the one I owed you, and pocket $50.


That's shorting in a nutshell. You borrow a stock, commodity or asset, sell it, and agree to give it back at a later date, making money if the price goes down. In this case however - the price went way up, and the Bitcoin exchanges want their Bitcoins back (a 'call'), forcing people to buy a ton at market rate and give them back to the exchange, pumping the price a grand or so.

No, professor Sarin. You've got your facts wrong. The system could work just fine with one miner (although it would never come to that). What would happen if the bitcoin price fell below a miner's cost is that he and others at his budget-level would drop out and the overall mining difficulty level would fall. If it fell far enough, hobbyist-miners who had been priced out would find themselves priced back in. Bitcoin mining would become increasingly decentralized. Fewer big miners = lower difficulty level = more smaller miners. ",1523551866

They then have positions and sell off as needed + profitable.

BCH all of a sudden represented a tangible threat to Core's narrative. At this stage, if you were ant-BCH and wanted to discredit it, how would you do it? Well one potential option was to create a number of other bullshit forks to try and water down the assumed authenticity of BCH by proxy.

How curious that these intentionally shitty forks started cropping up immediately following the creation of BCH.

"What could motivate me? I got into crypt when I bought BTC for $100 years ago. I understand crypto.

They way you and some people shit on IOTA is the way people shit on bitcoin when I first got in. No different. Bitcoin was called a scam incessantly. It used this weird, hard to comprehend innovation called a blockchain. It didn’t work the way people used to older tech expected, so they brutally ridiculed it with their expertise. Same goes these days for IOTA and their Tangle.

But the reality of bitcoin then and IOTA now is that if you take the time to understand the technology, learn how they are intended to work, and the growing ecosystems around them, you realize they are revolutionary and disruptive technology. And like all technologies in the early stages, they are flawed initially. These kinks get worked out. Btc is still battling out its kinks (like the fight over segwit and the blocksize limit).

So consider this advice from somebody who’s been in crypto for a long time... IOTA is not a scam. It is amazing tech with amazing (and everyday more mainstream ) minds building out the tech and infrastructure. IOTA has a strong potential to be the payment and secure communication protocol between the 100 billion IOT devices expected by 2025.

My guess from your writings is that you’ll disregard my advice. My friends disregarded mine when I first got in and laughed when mtgox imploded and blamed transaction malleability, accusing bitcoin of having a fatal flaw. They’re all regretting it now.",1523550513
"&gt; Given the 1MB limit needs to be increased why not do it now, it only gets harder?

Because of the same point I made above

&gt; A simple scaling solution of ""adding another decimal"" would have been easier to roll out... but that keeps **kicking the can down the road** with regards to addressing other issues.

On top of that, trying to incorporate too many changes at once could cause unforeseen harm. Bitcoin, for all it's resilience, is also very fragile too. There are billions of dollars at stake and one mistake could bring it down. And in the grand scheme of things, it's market cap is not very large. Jeff Bezos could theoretically buy all of it... not to mention many governments around the world. That scary.

I agree, a blocksize increase would seem nice. When fees were hitting more than $20 it hurt me, too. But it's easy to be an armchair developer and blocksize advocate from the comfort of our homes while sometimes attending conferences and clapping at things we hear without actually being in the thick of things. To actually make changes, push code out, commit them, and compile new release binaries while ensuring no code bugs and fighting against attackers (hackers, political nut-jobs, governments, etc) is not easy. I'm actually impressed when a project shows such patience. It shows confidence and demonstrates that at least some care and due diligence is being done. Time and time again I keep hearing that ""Core is trying to destroy Bitcoin"". Why would they? There is so much competition out there in the world of cryptocurrencies. To destroy the number 1 project as an insider makes no sense. If they ""control"" Bitcoin, then why not just monopolize it even more and crush Bitcoin Cash and others?

This is more philosophical than I intend to go, but much of what I say is largely a brain dump :-P

&gt; And given there is evidence to support 50 transactions a day on chain for the global population with off the shelf technology why not have LN and unlimited block size compete?

They can, and I personally welcome it. There is already Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, not to mention tons of other forks and competing ideas out there. Check CoinMarketCap. The problem for other projects is Bitcoin has more support. Bitcoin Cash is an underdog but as history has shown, underdogs can rise to dominance just by showing they are better.

&gt; The LN with 1MB blocks is going to take 76 years for the population today to open a single channel each. 

I haven't done the math nor seen that figure, but I will take it on your word the math is correct. But I am thinking this is assuming everyone must do an on-chain transaction first to get a channel.

What if not everyone had to? You could simply download a lightning-only wallet and buy some Bitcoin on the LN just like you can today at BTC ATMs, exchanges, etc? Just thinking off into the future. I don't see that as being outside the realm of possibility.",1523550511

This is how this place works, there is *no* censorship, but they'll discourage any dissident view by downvoting them as fast as possible, even if you bring actual arguments. It's much easier than trying to retort, especially when they have no argument.

"&gt; So why use Bitcoin in the first place if you can just use some shitcoin, open a channel into Lightning (at much cheaper cost), and spend at any LN-accepting merchant?

Because you can't ""just use some shitcoin"".  The value being spent has to come from somewhere, and the value being received also needs to go somewhere.  You have to consider how people are going to store that value in addition to the mechanism they're using for spending it.

If people want to store value in Bitcoin, then exchanging bitcoins to altcoins (or vice versa) will cost them transaction fees anyway, so they might as well open a LN payment channel and eliminate the additional exposure to altcoin volatility.  The same is true for maximalists of any particular altcoin: if you prefer FooCoin as a store of value, then you're better off opening LN channels with your FooCoins than buying BarCoins that have half the transaction fees.  And for fiat users, they're probably better off just storing their fiat in a bank that provides support for sending and receiving payments over LN.

So, in short, I don't think LN offers any adoption advantages to altcoins, and I don't see how it's a threat to Bitcoin's long-term value.",1523550123

Margin trading is very risky because when the market moves in your direction you make more money,  but when it moves against you, you lose more money. 

If you lose so much there is a risk you can't pay back what you borrowed,  the exchange will automatically close your trade at a loss, which is what happened to people trying yo go short this morning.

Can you imagine what will happen to the price when all these large scale organizations load up on this in order to use the platform...

"**Soros and Rockefeller invest in Bitcoin and Co.**

After George Soros described cryptocurrency as a ""bubble"" in January, it has now become known that the legendary hedge fund manager wants to invest in the digital currency.

Soros said at the World Economic Forum in Davos that cryptocurrencies can not function as actual currencies due to their volatility. In the high volatility, however, he seems to see an attractive opportunity to increase his capital. Soros plans to start trading in digital currencies with its $ 26 billion investment vehicle, Bloomberg reports.

The venture capital firm Venrock (combination of ""Venture"" and ""Rockefeller"") is also interested in digital assets. Venrock will cooperate with Coinfund, a group of investors focused exclusively on crypto start-ups.

The attacks by Soros and Rockefeller show that the big investors have not yet written off cryptocurrencies. Maybe even more ""big players"" will follow soon, which could be the starting signal for a new rally.

"I have read the article, and the only reason I can think of for not increasing the blocksize 'before other things' is that, as Bitcoin Cash has shown, once the blocksize increase was put in to fix the network, that is literally the only fix that will ever be utilized.  And while 'a' blocksize increase was considered generally benign and would fix all the problems of the time, an unlimited blocksize increase was not without issue (to say the least), having miners control the blocksize increase added immediate controversy and if anyone says 'changing a single line of code to fix a problem *won't* cause any unexpected problems', I would say they've never fixed a line of code, or are simply poor developers with little to no experience in the cascade of problems that could come from changing almost anything.",1523549299

We can agree that things come up that could have been handled differently, but with so many things to defend against, and all the hoops and sideshows to deal with to try to explain what they wanted to do, and need people to adopt, i'm surprised they have had time to code anything worthwhile.

Whereas in Ripple, you will always be relying on these institutions to do it for you. You call it decentralized in real world, I call it centralized by banks and Ripple. 


You can compare Litecoin to Ripple transactions live on many pages out there. They're both dirty cheap. Blockchain is expensive, but doable and there's always potential for further innovation, whereas Ripple cannot innovate to become decentralized for real. 


Litecoin is also implementing Lightning, on top of already being cheap. They did tests and it ended up costing essentially nothing. That's all of Litecoins value proposition too. Have cheap transactions and in Litecoins case, it's not a scam like BCH and it's not centralized bullshit like Ripple.

So the takeaway from this?  Dont use high margin, know when to look for stop loss hunting (check out wyckoff theory) and if you're confident it's going down, dont use high margin, etc...set your stop loss slightly above resistance (if you're shorting) or slightly below support (if you're longing) so that you have that barrier of protection against the whales, because even if they move the market or force it past a close support/resistance level, they'll likely not push it past major support/resistance and if they do you have your stop loss ready.

People would be fighting for their lives",1523547714
"OK, let me explain leveraged shorts again.

Shorting is in effect borrowing someone else's bitcoin, immediately selling it for cash, then buying it back at a later date (hopefully for cheaper).

To make this kind of trade you need to have collateral on the exchange in case the price of the bitcoin goes up and you need to pay more for it. If I borrow a bitcoin when the value is $7,000 and the price goes up to $8,000, I would need $1000 to cover the amount it's gone up. If I only had $1000 collateral sitting in my account, the exchange would force me to buy back the bitcoin the instant it hit $8K, since I wouldn't be able to cover any further increases to the price. This results in the $1K I had on the exchange being lost and I am ""liquidated"" (forced to spend my cash and left with nothing).

So that's a basic short position. A *leveraged* short position is just adding a multiplier effect to my gains or my losses.

Let's say I'm REALLY confident the price will go down. Instead of borrowing 1 bitcoin and selling it for $7K, I borrow 10 bitcoins and sell them all for $70K. This is called a 10x leverage. The nice thing about doing this is if the price drops to say $6K, I'll make $10,000 ($1,000 profit times 10 borrowed bitcoins), whereas without leverage I'd only make $1,000.

On the flip side though, now my $1000 of collateral doesn't go very far. The price would only need to sneak up to $7100 before I'd be liquidated, since I only have $71,000 in cash but owe 10 bitcoins. If the price hits $7100, the exchange takes all my cash and forced me to buy back all 10 bitcoins at $7100 each, leaving me with nothing.

Many exchanges let people go up to 100x leverage, so you can imagine the stakes for those bets. Many of these guys would also have a significant collateral but are hoping to make huge gains on BTC drops.

So basically, the price just spiked $1000. Pretty much anybody with a highly leveraged short position just got liquidated and lost all their money.",1523547713

How about we focus on increasing the use of and decrease the cost of solar and wind. Let's come up with cheaper energy storage with batteries, and pumped hydro etc.  Can we we collectively decide that maybe it is okay to pay a bit more for solar and wind in the short term as we did with unleaded gas?

"It's simple, market capital is calculated by multiplying the supply by the current going price on the exchange. Here's a hypothetical scenario:

I make a coin called CrackCoin. There's 500 in circulation. I sell you 1 CrackCoin for $1. The market cap is now technically $500. I decide that I'm never selling CrackCoin again for whatever reason. You however do want to sell it and make a profit, so you want to sell 1 CrackCoin for $10. Someone buys this from you and now the market cap of CrackCoin is $5000. Only a fraction of that $5000 has flowed around the market.

Here's another example. Bitcoin is worth $10,000. We create an ICO for CrackCoin at $1 per coin with a 500 maximum supply. All of the CrackCoin is sold for $500 worth of Bitcoin but the price of Bitcoin does not change because Bitcoin was not traded against USD, it was traded for a new coin. So the market cap of Bitcoin stayed the same, yet now you have a new coin called CrackCoin which has an ICO market cap of $500. CrackCoin then gets listed and people decide to sell it for 10x ICO price. The market cap is now $5000 and yet the market cap of Bitcoin remains unchanged from this entire ordeal.

So, if bitcoin replaced all fiat, in 155 years it would be replacing 2.046 Quadrillion in Fiat because of the inflation.  That is assuming no economic growth, which is crazy honestly.

Imagine that several high value individuals invested 10 million usd into Bitcoin on january 1st 2017.  On the last day of 2017, they had 13 times what they started with.  So now they have 130 million dollars.  117 million of that is profit that they need to pay taxes on. 

Being in the highest tax bracket (39.6%) they owe 46.33 million to the IRS on April 17th or they have to pay even more because of penalties.

Simply put, they are cashing out a lot of their Bitcoin to pay those taxes to avoid having to pay even more tax penalties.

When you start selling 46 million worth of Bitcoin, you are going to get less and less for it as you are competing with all the others trying to sell at the same time.  There's nothing they can do about this because they are forced to sell.  They can't just HODL and wait for a higher price.  This drives the price down as we've seen over the last month.

$18m Market Cap
12.5m Supply

**What does Phore stand for?**
The philosophy of the team is to deliver. To date the team has yet to miss a deadline and has a continuous output of technical and corporate development.

**What problems does Phore solve?**
Most cryptocurrencies require a lot of technical knowledge. Its aim is to be easily accessible, so ""even my grandma can use it"" - using it as currency. Phore aims to build a blockchain infrastructure centered around a decentralized marketplace with a growing number of features, like decentralized crowdfunding in Q3.  Phore Labs will become an incubator to create new blockchain technology and advance Phore further. Phore Scholarships, paid scholarships for young blockchain graduates to becoming a Core Developer at Phore.

**Why is Phore a sleeping giant?**
Phore is evolving into one of the most flexible ecosystem with capabilities that will surpass others. The team operates on an aggressive release schedule to deliver updates on time or before it. Phore is a fork of Pivx and will have additional features such as SegWit Integration, Atomic Swaps and Sidechains to allow additional features and dApps. The next feature being worked on is Fundraisers via marketplace.
The team is seasoned as the Phore team emerged from KTK. KTK was the first crypto project to host a decentralized marketplace in 2014. The team works hard and promotes their achievments rather than creating hype. Phore had no ICO or large premine and is self-funded: it operates on a tight monthly budget which is voted upon by Masternode holders.
&gt;**Moonshot (CTO)** *I want Phore to have the best combination of blockchain technology and decentralized applications. I want Phore to be accessible on as many exchanges and fiat gateways and platforms as possible. I also want everyone to know about Phore's benefits and knows how to use it, including people outside of the technical crypto crowd. That takes good marketing, and I'm very proud of the marketing talent we have put together on the Phore team.*

**Why will Phore have a major social impact?**
I will quote the Co-CEO from [this article](https://thefintechtimes.com/phore-bootsrapped-decentrilised-and-community-governed/)
&gt;Through our decentralized marketplace and partnerships with providers, we will bring internet capabilities to unserved and underserved regions, enabling some of the poorest countries in the world to become part of the global economy. Later this year, we will launch a pilot program in an emerging market, giving people with little or no access to the digital economy the ability to buy and sell goods and services.
Just wait for the partnership announcement ;)

**Recent Updates:**
*[Incorporation. Phore Blockchain is now a company](https://medium.com/@phoreblockchain/phore-blockchain-files-to-incorporate-in-gibraltar-90aeb0f4eb3b)

Leverage in trading simply refers to the ability to increase the size of your trade or investment by using credit from a broker. When trading using leverage, you are effectively borrowing from your broker, while the funds in your account act as collateral.

When the price of BTC moves in the opposite direction of your position (i.e. It moves up whilst you're short) then the 'broker' (exchanges in this context) will liquidate your position (funds in your account acting as collateral) which closes your position, and buys BTC (forcing the price up further, liquidating more people and so on and so on)

"&gt;Do you think saving to buy a house in full is a better option and people are just too dumb to realize it? ""they can't because fiat is inflationary"" is not an answer, there are thousands of deflationary assets, and your only previous argument against them was liquidity, which isn't an issue for saving 30 years to buy a house. you buy gold for 30 years then sell it to buy a house.

Our current system doesn't really allow most people to save up enough money to buy a house without going into debt or waiting for 30 years. With a better form of money like Bitcoin it would take much less time though. Gold is better than fiat but still you don't really own it unless you have it physically which is a lot less convenient than owning Bitcoin instead. With Bitcoin you are in complete control of your own money which combined with it being a deflationary asset makes it perfect for me. It's also young and has much more potential for growth, albeit also more volatile due to this. I don't think it's for everyone right now, but as it grows and develops and becomes more stable it will become more attractive for more people I believe. I never recommend other people to put their entire savings in it, but a small percentage isn't a bad thing. I put in a lot more but that's because it's my passion and my work.

&gt;Are you going to use your bitcoin then to invest in bitcoin based businesses/projects like Lightning? Or are you just going to sit on them and wait for other peoples work to make them more valuable?

Sure I invest into projects I find valuable like Lightning, is there any reason why you're assuming I just sit on my coins and do nothing with them? I certainly will not spend my coins to buy silly things with it, but sure I use some of it for investing purposes. I don't shame people who just hold onto their coins though, I think that's a perfectly legitimate use case. By holding onto your coins you are adding human value to the network and make it a little bit bigger. Just by doing that you already support the entire project and help it grow. Not everyone is a builder or good at investing (look at how many people invest in scammy ICOs), and that's perfectly fine.

&gt;I'm asking you, not Andreas Antonopoulos, I already know what he thinks.

You just said bitcoin was good for saving, if you think its going to be a revolutionary currency you could have said so, but then that might raise awkward questions about how this currency is going to become popular when everyone is hoarding it for ""savings"".

Bitcoin is great for saving, right now however it's not very good for spending. As Lightning develops more and becomes more popular this will change in the future, but right now the blockchain simply doesn't scale well enough for it to become popular as a payment option.

"&gt; Really?

Yup.

&gt;  I find it hard to believe because the point of LN is to be a 2nd layer solution getting transactions off the underlying blockchain. 

It does this by rendering older ""channel states"" (i.e. older unconfirmed transactions) invalid to the Lightning network. They're still valid to Bitcoin, but if you try to broadcast one, your channel partner can broadcast a newer recovery state to claim the entire channel's funds and usurp your attempt to close an invalid state. Bitcoin sees the newer transaction as the valid one by virtue of the time lock, so the fraud attempt will fail assuming the partner or his watchtower broadcast the recovery.

&gt;  If what you say is true, then every LN transaction has an onchain transaction. 

Not quite. As a LN transaction occurs, it updates the state of a channel, rendering the old channel no good - it won't ever be confirmed because a newer one exists to replace it (again, assuming the partner or his watchtower do their part). So if a channel is used many times, all those commercial transactions are aggregated into a single bitcoin transaction.

&gt; This makes no sense to me.

Did that help?",1523544582

There is never any question about the present market demand or cost.

"* What is transaction malleability?

Transaction malleability is the ability for someone to create a clone of a transaction that is functionally identical but has a different TXID.

* Why is it bad?

It's not. It's actually useful for several things. However, some use cases depend on reliable TXID's for unconfirmed transactions, and malleable transactions can't be used for those purposes.

* I heard BCH fixed malleability. Is that true?

Sort of. Third party malleability has been fixed (meaning no *other* person can malleate a transaction) but the person that crafted the transaction always has the ability to malleate his own transaction by crafting a double-spend.

* How?

By requiring all transactions to conform to a specific format. Independently malleated (i.e. not doublespent) versions of a transaction will not follow that format and thus no longer be acceptable to the network.

* Wait, you said I can always malleate my own transaction. How does BTC and Lightning get around that?

It doesn't. BTC transactions are not reliable until confirmed. Lightning requires confirmation before and after use. You can't malleate a transaction unless you have the cooperation of all signatories to the transaction, and Lightning channels can't be malleated at all because they use SegWit and multiple signatories.",1523543672

"Leverage applies to margin trading. Margin trading is trading on the difference between entering and exiting a position. Because you're trading on the difference and not the actual ""commodity"". The margin deposit is a collateral for the broker, who will liquidate you in case the market moves in the opposite direction, because he doesn't want to lose money because of you. 

So let's say I go short on BTC with a leverage of 1 and deposit of $1000. I buy 1 btc from the broker. If the price goes down, I close the position and pocket the difference. If it goes up, it starts eating away my deposit, and once the price goes up by 1000 the broker will be like, dude, you're losing my money. Buys back his bitcoin with what i sold it for when I entered + the deposit. 
Leverage means how much BTC will the broker allow me buy. If I go 100:1, it means I buy 100, and thus every price increase is 100x worse. So even a $10 increase on my 100:1 position means I lose my whole deposit

&gt;I'm also not about to condemn a whole community for the actions of two people who don't hold any sway in the project.

It has nothing to do with the fact that you're a member of that community does it? You know? A little bias?

&gt;My argument was not that the trusted setup compromised anonymity, it was that it makes Zcash trustful, not trustless.

But this argument is irrelevant in relation to ZCash's privacy, which is what we were talking about. You don't have to trust anything about ZCAsh's privacy.

&gt;The value of a token is not indicative of the value the project behind the token. 

Its not a one-to-one correlation but there is definitely a link. 

&gt;I guess we have different definitions of how long ago things are in the cryptosphere. I don't know what you mean by ""you guys"", literally all of the devs were 100% open about the paper and it was fixed.

This is where you guys are lying, it WASN'T FIXED and they were not open about it. They, like you, lied and said it was fixed. But in [the research posted by cryptographers](https://wired.com/story/monero-privacy/) it is clear that the flaw went from tracing coins 90% of the time to tracing them 45% of the time. So no, it was not 'fixed'.

&gt;m claiming that you're a Dash fan who happens to think that optional privacy is just as good as default privacy, which is objectively false.

It is an non-argument because you have to assume that your premise is correct, which it is not. 'Default privacy' is only better than 'optional privacy' because it increases the anonymity set. There is nothing magical about it, it just makes it harder and impractical to perform various analyses. So, if your optional privacy provides a large enough anonymity set then you can have SUPERIOR optional privacy than with 'default privacy'. 

**This is currently the case with PIVX and Dash**. Neither of them has anywhere near a 45% chance of traceability.

&gt;Either optional privacy makes a coin's privacy ""broken"" as you put it and creates linkability, in which case I agree with you. 

Again, this is only assuming that ALL OPTIONAL PRIVACY SCHEMES SUFFER FROM THE SAME FLAWS. Like above, **this is an argument formed from an incorrect premise:** MONERO'S privacy scheme was destroyed by being optional. This is because it made it easy to decrease the size of the anonymity set to the point where you can guess which mixins are the real ones. THAT IS ONLY A FLAW IN MONERO'S OPTIONAL PRIVACY.

That is not an inherent property of optional privacy. That is an inherent flaw of MONERO'S privacy. 

&gt;Please explain how you intend to un-pretzel your inane logic here.

Because your argument was based on a flawed premise that I've explained is incorrect above.

&gt;Monero is more private than PIVX currently, that could change in the future. I'm not going to crap all over PIVX, I like their community for the most part.

No, PIVX demonstrably has a larger anonymity set than Monero. 10% of ALL PIVX held in wallets is sent to the accumulator which means that 10% of all pivx is minted as ZPIV and has no coin history.  Further, Monero is vulnerable to timing attacks such that 45% of the time you can determine the traceability of a coin! PIVX has no such vulnerability. 

&gt;I don't know who Ryan Taylor is or why I should trust him, but you have to understand that everyone who buys Dash is trusting that nothing shady happened during those 48 hours. That's not a good starting point for a decentralized blockchain.

Well, that's a good point. Tell us, how does your community deal with the fact that your coin was started by scammers? The largest portion of your hashrate comes from, get this, minergate which your community admits is SCAMMING unsuspecting users! So I guess your question would best be answered by yourself.

&gt;You mean the Cryptonight bug that the devs fixed as soon as they learned about it and announced it to the community in a completely transparent manner? The bug that anyone with a wallet can confirm was never exploited in Monero? Yeah no one is losing sleep over that bug. That's a perfect example of misinformation.

Right, except the very same thing you guys keep fud'ing the Zcash community over ACTUALLY happened to you too.

&gt;I'm not FUDDING anymore than you are. I'm pointing out bugs that were fixed and so are you. 

The monero 'bug' still isn't fixed, 45% traceability bub. No other coin has that failing.

&gt;1% of Dash addresses own over 70% of the coins. You call that ""well distributed""? 

Compared to? If you don't ask this question, then maybe it is YOU who should spend more time in math class.

&gt;You're embarrassing yourself. I was able to easily dismantle your argument. You made a fatal mistake by talking yourself into a corner by claiming that optional privacy was just as good as default privacy. The only way to argue yourself out of your current position is to completely invalidate your claim that the Monero link paper broke Monero's privacy because the central criticism of that paper is that optional privacy creates linkability between private transactions. I've just hogtied you with your own logic dude, and I haven't even had my morning coffee yet.

I'm sorry to say that, bluster aside time has not been good to your comment. All your talk about 'default privacy' and it turns out your coin can't do better than a coin toss. That's just as bad as bitcoin from a computer science perspective. ",1523543640

Here you are wrong; At any given point in time the cost/reward deman/supply are crystal clear. Just because you dont like the prices doesnt mean they are wrong.

it was clear through most of the bubble that mining work was being vastly overcompensated. So the market started firing back up old obsolete miners and deploying new ones as fast as it could adapt. This takes time. Once it came back down to normal, it is still well compensated, which explains the continuing growth in hashrate. 

You seem obsessed with short term swings, which easily average out compared to the time it takes to build out the infrastructure. This is partially because you are accustomed to the stabilizing effect of denomination: when nearly all prices and contracts are written in dollar terms, it causes a massive attenuation of short term price swings.

4. The driving forces behind Bitcoin adoption has been speculation, the desire to acquire a limited resource, the desire to obfuscate one's financial dealings from the government, self-reliance, facilitate crime, technology interest, desire to be part of something new, and the crypto-anarcho desires to resist / undermine / insulate one's self from current financial system and its masters.

The most notable issue is that Tether is basically acting like a 19th-century wildcat bank--meaning that it's either going to come under regulatory scrutiny very soon, or it's going to be revealed that they don't actually have the $2.28 billion in fiat needed to back every USDT in existence (or both). If that happens, I'd expect to see a major market correction, given that Tether is currently 15th.

If you notice my username ""slvbtc"" (silver,bitcoin), know you are not alone in your decision.

And to answer OP this is my theory:

The Dow is about to break down out of a bear flag, target is 23000, this will trigger the Dow theory sell signal taking US stocks down into offical bear market territory. Powell will then launch QE4 and cut rates. Treasuries will begin to sell off, and China will see this. China will start dumoing their huge position in US bonds and that will push the dollar a lot lower. These events act as a negative feed back loop on stocks and stocks fall further. Then property begins its fall all while bonds are still crashing. Next up global stock markets follow suit making it even worse.

This will be just as bad if not worse than 08'. 

At the same time gold will break out from this $1350 resistance and go straight to $1600 before pausing for breath then making new all time highs.

Bitcoin may or may not sell off initially as people sell it to cover losses in the stock market. But the safe haven trade becomes predominant and banks start failing again like 08' bitcoin will reignite a rally into the hundreds of thousands.

"&gt; Uh, actually if we took your example literally and applied it today with the assumption that only a small niche of people would be interested in bitcoin then bitcoin inflation would be substantial due to the cost of mining and mining reward. Without substantial demand the price can't be sustained because currently miners produce 1800 bitcoins per day and will continue to do so for another 2 years so when they sell and there isn't much demand the price will tend to drop due to monetary inflation.

It might drop, but then it would rise.  There is no scenario in which Bitcoin is not worth $1 million dollars each....eventually.

&gt;Yeah. On that we can agree. And how do you envision the masses of people who don't care about their fiat being subjected to yearly 2% inflation to start caring about it? Fiat is convenient and people don't hold most of their assets in fiat anyway. That slow devaluation doesn't hurt much unless you're storing all your money in mattresses and not invest it in anything.

At any given time 100% of the money is under someone's mattress.

I largely agree with you though, I think that is why fiat has beaten gold--2% loss per year is less than the pain-in-the-ass that gold + cost of securing it is.  Fiat beat gold in the market, and would do so again.  Also the supply of gold is increasing as well, especially when the price goes up and people start mining like crazy.  This is not the case with Bitcoin.

"&gt; the former is inflationary, the latter (perhaps mildly) deflationary... and the former is the relevant figure.

Did you read the article?  It explains why inflation is only a thing because the supply increase is unknown and continues increasing.  Sure if you a holder dumps 1M coins on the market, that has a short term impact, more so because the demand has *decreased* than supply has increased, which....it hasn't really.  There is still the same supply in existence (both mined and unmined) before and after the sale.

&gt;Stuff like ""Segwit will lock in on mainnet before August 1"", ""Craig Wright won't provide signatures using Satoshi's private keys despite his promises to do so"", ""2x won't take over and kill the original chain""

You're really going out on a limb there with those wacky predictions!  How could anyone have known these very obvious things would occur!?  The only one I didn't also ""predict"" is the *timing* of segwit adoption, which was very much dependent on the decisions of a few people whose thinking you could not have fully known, so on this case your ""prediction"" was dependent upon the choices of ONE person.  Even though we predicted the same things, I didn't go on an Attention-Getter proclaiming myself as an economic soothsayer on an internet message board.

&gt;I'm willing to expound thoroughly on my reasoning and logic, discuss and consider opposing perspectives (and explain the specifics of why I ultimately disagree with them), and lay out my thoughts in advance of the event(s) in question. When dozens and dozens of these sorts of arguments have their conclusions proven true over the months and years as virtually none of them are proven false, 

That is *NOT ENOUGH* and that you think it would be sufficient reveals profound ignorance about scientific rigor.  It MAY suggest you have a good understanding of economics, but does not prove causality.  For that, you would need to start isolating variables and statistically normalization and things you probably don't even know how to do. 

&gt;When dozens and dozens of these sorts of arguments have their conclusions proven true over the months and years as virtually none of them are proven false, despite the fact that in every case a significant chunk of people disagreed with me at the time,

How can you think the number of people who disagreed with you is in any way relevant?  This is BITCOIN, the vast majority does not understand what is going on here (hyperbitcoinization) so of course they are going to be very very wrong.  That you are right on some (what I would consider) obvious outcomes does NOT mean you are right about the underlying causes of them, especially considering you admit there are many variables.  For example if the halvening was every 10 years instead, I think we would have still seen a similar rise in bitcoin price, due to its superior monetary properties. 

&gt;Why, exactly, do you think Mercury's transit will have this specific effect on Bitcoin's price? Have you backtested historical market data and found a convincing correlation?

Ok, look, please don't write posts to me which resembles advertisements.  And please avoid using vapid terms like 'digital social contract'.  Rousseau was as wrong about such a thing ever existing in history when he penned those words hundreds of years ago as you are about using the to describe bitcoin.  Speak plainly.    

But at least you admitted what bitcoin is: simply another form of commodity money.

The problem is, money is **not** a commodity.  It is **not** produced for sale in the market.  [Karl Polanyi](https://books.google.ca/books/about/The_Great_Transformation.html?id=xHy8oKa4RikC&amp;redir_esc=y) the visionary Austrian economic history called money a ""fictitious commodity"".

I'm not advocating anything.  I'm telling you how money works in a modern capitalist economy.  And I don't know who this Satoshi Nakamoto is and why I should throw in anyone's lot with someone who writes under a pseudonym and is advocating old right-wing market fundamentalist solutions.

&gt;The state and capitalism have fused into a single object--this potentiality for democracy to bring the beast to heel was liquidated long ago

The state and capitalism have not fused.  Their relationship is more akin to two coiled serpents in an embrace, close but distinct.  Has been from the beginning. But the economic and the political under capitalism are characterized by a relative separation from one another.  Whereas under previous modes of production (feudalism) economic *and* political power were in the hands of the ruling classes (think the opening scene of the Godfather), capitalists have only economic power, and are forced to turn to the state to carry out extra-economic coercion that they need.

&gt;capital reigns supreme and it is the state who makes sure we mind the master. 

This is true.

&gt;Bitcoin is a commodity-money

Ok great.  So again, what is it that the author said that is untrue?  

&gt;but it is not apolitical.

But it is though.  Money making/managing/creation are taken *out* of the hands of public officials (and with them by extension monetary and fiscal policy) and put under the rubric of 'the market'.  That's what apolitical money is.  Money that can be taken out of the hands of politicians who might do all sorts of things with it, from bailing out the banks to forestall and prevent an economic collapse, to spending it into existence to create jobs.  The wet-dream of right-wing market fundamentalists has been to find some way in which money could be put into the market and left to 'regulate itself'.  

But such a thing is not possible.  Never was.  

&gt;No money is apolitical. Even gold was and still is political

You're right.  Money can **never** be apolitical. 

&gt;which is why there was the whole silver democrats movement in the late 19th century, and subsequently the creation of the federal reserve after the panic of 1907. This is not by the failure of gold as a commodity-money, but by the capturing of it and oligopolization of it through the banking system. 

This is completely wrong.  Everything you said here is wrong.  The free silver-movement was primarily supported by rural farmers who were dying (literally) under the deflationary tendencies of the gold standard, an arrangement whereby the state had to limit its supply of money to the gold reserves it had, since it had to honour a conversation between dollars-&gt;gold.  This was the 'sound money policy' and its aim - as always - was to guard the so-called 'integrity' of money, i.e. to prevent at all costs inflation, which hits the rich and those who draw incomes form owning capital first and hardest.  The price was a naturally deflationary system.  To quote Polanyi on the problems with commodity money in an industrial society:

*""A system of commodity money... is incompatible with industrial production. Commodity money is simply a commodity which happens to function as money, and its amount, therefore, cannot, in principle, be increased at all, except by diminishing the amount of the commodities not functioning as money. In practice commodity money is usually gold or silver, the amount of which can be increased, but not by much, within a short time.  The expansion of production and trade unaccompanied by an increase in the amount of money must cause a fall in the price level-precisely the type of ruinous deflation which we have in mind.  Token money was developed at an early date to shelter trade from the enforced deflations that accompanied the use of specie when the volume of business swelled. No market economy was possible without the medium of artificial money.""*

&gt;The later failure we see of fractional banking systems around the world in the 1930s was also not the fault of gold as money, but the banking systems. 

This is literally twisting everything on its head.  Every country that stayed on the gold standard through the Depression suffered worse consequences than ones which jettisoned asinine commodity money in favour of what you call fiat currency, but which today is simply money.  [Professor Mark Blyth](https://books.google.ca/books/about/Austerity.html?id=9lQkpnALnWAC) said of France's defeat (France stayed on the gold standard till the bitter end) at the hands of a Germany for example - which had years earlier repudiated the gold standard - that *""Hitler knew one thing. The franc would be defended at all costs. As for France, that was another matter entirely.""*

The only thing that saved global capitalism in the 1930s was states getting off gold and inflating their economies.  That and the war economy.  

But anyways, I digress.  You see how bitcoin is nothing new?  How in talking about what it supposedly is, we're back to talking about commodity money and gold standards from 150 years ago?

&gt;Yes it is, and because you fail to see this as anything new, you also fail to see how a design like this can enable a totally new money system, and political agreements. Bitcoin is now just one of hundreds of projects built on blockchain technology, which all have various potentials as money, but more importantly social contracts. 

How?   Explain this in plain terms what exactly we're supposed to be looking forward to.

&gt;Real deflation in fractional reserve fiat money systems do hit the poor and working class the hardest. Bitcoin is not a fraction reserve money system, but a commodity-money.

No.  Commodity money which cannot increase in amount to meet an increase in business activity/commodity production means deflation.  The precise advantage of token money is that *it can* and *it does*.  

&gt;If we were going for just bitcoin, perhaps you would be right. But were not. There are now thousands of different crypto assets, all working towards the common goal of creating new forms of social and economic agreements. 

Again, this is great promotional brochure talk, and if I were a fool looking to buy a timeshare or something you might be able to trick me with all this.  But I wish to know specifically - from a left point of view - what it is that bitcoin offers the working class and the poor over the current - terribly imperfect and iniquitous - system of money?

&gt;Do some research on how second layer solutions like the lightning network are solving internal transaction fees, but furthermore this meme explains it better than I can. 

I still don't understand what this means.  What am I supposed to take from this?  But I will pose a question in turn: what do you have to say to the [massive environmental costs](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/17/bitcoin-electricity-usage-huge-climate-cryptocurrency) of this so-called 'wave of the future'?  Why is this ultra-futuristic 'disruptive' technology so [addicted](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-15/turning-coal-into-bitcoin-dirty-secret-of-2017-s-hottest-market) to good old fashioned coal for instance?  Do you have a meme that explains that too or can you actually discuss corporeal matters?

&gt;I plan on writing a detailed response to this piece in my blog, so I'll be able to provide a more in-depth response there. 

I actually look forward to reading it in all seriousness.  Please PM me.  I also encourage you to e-mail a link of it to [Professor Beggs](http://sydney.edu.au/arts/political_economy/staff/profiles/michael.beggs.php).  ",1523542352

"&gt; ""economical value"" - yet another vague concept. $150 billion dollars - what specific connection to the real world does this number have?

&gt; price is the amount i have to pay to purchase single unit of product. circulation is number of units of product on the market. multiplying the two gives you a number that is totally abstract and disconnected from the real world.
&gt; 
&gt; when i go to the store and i see that price of an apple is 5c i can multiply it by 10 to know how much ten apples will cost me.

It's exactly the same for the crypto-currencies, they aren't different (as of their purchase power) just because they are intangibles.

As of today we uses the money (as reference we say the US Dollar) to attribute a value to everything, one day when the national currencies will be (eventually) no more there will be no more comparison between the two, and we'll say ""that thing cost X Bitcoin"", but that day has yet to come and until then we'll continue to talk about ""value in fiat"" and ""market capitalization"" to define the ""power"" (the importance) of a crypto-currency.

Similarly, one can try to say that a government's taxes are not bitcoin's problem. In the abstract, maybe that works. But if you're trying to make an argument that bitcoin needs to be used in the real world — which is the point of the meme — it's crucial to take into account *what it means* to use bitcoin in the real world.

You can pay them, which makes spending bitcoin impractical, or you can ignore them, which incurs risk. Either way, it's not as simple as the ""spend it"" advocates would have you believe.",1523540985

About the second part, I am not sure I understood your point. Let say many people were short selling on a future expiring next week. But the price of BTC shot up, and the same for the future contracts. Then lots of those people position got liquidated today. I don't get how one is related to the other to be honest :(",1523540935
"While vacationing with friends in Buenos Aires last month, Alex Beene, a Tennessee government worker, said the topic of cryptocurrencies briefly came up during a dinner conversation.

The 30-year-old from Nashville told them he had bought bitcoin and litecoin last fall but recently sold most of his holdings. The discussion quickly shifted to another subject.

“Months ago, they would’ve been genuinely interested in how to invest in [cryptocurrencies], how it works, and where I [thought] the price was going,” he said. “Now it’s something that’s the brunt of jokes, like I had invested in comic books or baseball cards.”

After bitcoin’s frenzied rally last year, prices have lost about two-thirds of their value from a December high. The cryptocurrency had been trading around $7,000 in recent days, although a sharp jump Thursday morning briefly lifted the price above $7,900, according to CoinDesk. Nonetheless, in the past few months, bitcoin has faded off the front pages of newspapers and it no longer dominates people’s social-media feeds. Global internet searches for the word “bitcoin” have fallen by over 80% from December, according to Google Trends.


Bitcoin’s average daily trading volume this month is about 70% lower than on the most active days at the end of last year, according to bitcoinity.org. That includes steep declines on some of the biggest U.S. platforms, including Gemini, an exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, and San Francisco-based Coinbase. At one point in December, Coinbase was the most-downloaded free app in Apple Inc.’s App Store. Now, it doesn’t make the top 200.

J.C. Parets, a technical markets analyst in New York, remembers getting multiple phone calls a day about cryptocurrencies late last year. Clients, old high school friends, strangers and even his 88-year-old grandmother were intrigued.


“It wasn’t even like ‘should I buy crypto’ but instead it was ‘which one?’” he said. “Everyone was in on it.”

Four months later, those calls stopped coming.

“Nobody cares anymore,” Mr. Parets said.

To be sure, crypto die-hards are still passionate about digital currencies. But many first-time bitcoin buyers who came into the market in December and January are sitting on losses. Mainstream interest in the cryptocurrency market has diminished.

Regulators in the U.S., South Korea, and India are trying to curb speculative activity. Facebook Inc., Google Inc. and Twitter Inc. are banning advertising related to cryptocurrencies to stop scammers from promoting fraudulent schemes on these social-media platforms.

“All the hype is gone,” said Vijay Boyapati, a software engineer in Seattle who previously worked at Google and a food-delivery startup, and is nevertheless preparing to take a job in the cryptocurrency industry. “I think right now we’re in the boring phase.”

Mr. Boyapati, who bought his first bitcoin in 2012, has been through the market’s boom-and-bust cycles. “Once the crescendo happens, it usually doesn’t come back immediately,” he said.

When the investor frenzy dies down, “that’s when the most value is created,” he added, referring to the industry’s ability to innovate and implement new technological advancements that “will fuel the next boom.”

Among the cadre of investors who still believe in cryptocurrencies are the early adopters—people who bought in years ago and remain optimistic regardless of wild, short-term moves in prices. They buy and HODL—an acronym for “hold on for dear life”—that often epitomizes cryptocurrency enthusiasts.

Bitcoin’s nearly four-month bear market has coincided with slowing growth in the number of people opening new wallets online to store their cryptocurrencies, according to Blockchain.info.

That isn’t a positive indicator for cryptocurrency prices, said Nicholas Colas, a veteran analyst and co-founder of DataTrek Research , a new research firm that analyzes financial markets, including cryptocurrencies.

“The bottom line is that bitcoin is no different from any other emerging technology,” he said in a recent note. “It requires incremental adoption from new users in order to grow in value.”


And the typical mainstream investor like Mr. Beene, who works in the Tennessee Department of Labor and Workforce Development, remains skeptical. Even though he sold out at a profit, he said he believes cryptocurrencies “got too hot too quickly” and he has no plans to return to the market anytime soon.

“Six months ago, crypto was billed as the investment of the century,” he said. “Now it’s become a fading trade that can’t live up to its lofty reputation.”",1523540922

"&gt; That's what you believe but the masses aren't convinced. And the demand is out there but nowhere near the entire world, more like some small parts of every society that include tech enthusiasts, libertarians, criminals, people who disagree with monetary policy and...well, a lot of fomoed speculators who wanted to get rich quick. It's a niche and everyone has different opinion about what it should be, what it is and how it should work. 

Do you think there was ubiquitous demand for Yap stones on the island of Yap?  Is there ubiquitous demand for gold or even fiat currency?  Currencies do not become the dominate currency in their market by everyone suddenly choosing to demand them.  Economic consensus emerges and it looks like that consensus is building around Bitcoin.

Let's suppose that ONLY libertarians, cyberpunks, and criminals were to use bitcoin, and everyone else were to refuse and only use USD.  The libertarian criminal cyberpunks would have an economic advantage over the rest of society, as their money would not devalue due to inflation.  Naturally the value of Bitcoin would continue to grow if for no other reason than that the other currencies fall in value over time.  *Eventually* bitcoin will be wroth $1 million per coin, and knowing this up front would lure people over to jump on the boat, which causes a feedback look as the network size grows.

"&gt; so I refuse to borrow money from a bank to buy a house where I'd be stuck in if the housing market would collapse.

If you save up for 30 years to buy a house and then the housing market collapses, you still lose just as much value. The difference is you'll have to be paying rent for 30 years, on top of the cost of buying the house. 

Loans exist for a reason, because the marginal utility of having an asset now and then paying it off over decades is much higher than the marginal utility of going for decades without that asset and then buying it, especially something like a house which you will have to either rent or buy anyway.

If you get a mortgage for $100,000, you might end up having to pay $130,000 back over 20-30 years, even if there is a house price crash and the house goes down to $70,000, you will still be better off compared to saving because you won't have had to spend $100,000 on rent during that time.

Do you think saving to buy a house in full is a better option and people are just too dumb to realize it? Gold and other appreciating assets can be used for savings. Why hasn't everyone been saving up gold to buy houses?

&gt;I am comfortable where I am now financially and the only thing that truly drives me is building a better future for humanity

How is you holding onto bitcoins building a better future for humanity?

&gt;You just read what you want to read don't you? You've already made your mind up that it must be all about getting super rich.

You said you already have enough money to retire on, but that would be ""boring"". Yet your primary claim has been that bitcoin is about ""savings"" not getting rich quick. What exactly is ""exciting"" about a stable savings account?

This can lead to a situation where one short gets margin called (which increases the price as it buys bitcoin), leading to more shorts getting margin called due to the price increase - essentially causing a price increase avalanche. That may have happened here.",1523540623

"Look at the charts. It was the opposite. It was a huge sell market order that instantly recovered with people believing bear season is over, and continue to rise from there. 

Someone tried to dump the market and people believe the floor is already past us. Then a small semi-FOMO caused a massive spike. Then a small correction as people take profits. 

Where we go from here will be huge. If another run or spike happens, we could see insane FOMO get triggered from all the Tetherbois sitting on the sidelines watching the train leave the station.

Either that or we just bleed back out because crypto is dead.

"I'm just speaking from what I've experienced in crypto so far(keep in mind that isn't much, been in since June of last year). But I repeatedly have watched alts bleed any time btc goes in a uptrend. Until these recent months where we would get alt spikes with btc spikes... the trend before that was always, btc up, alts down. Btc down, alts down... btc stable, alts fly. Too many times have I sat in alts because they were significantly down on the btc ratio... and then they're not even close to the floor and I watch my portfolio btc value dwindle. 

There were several periods of bleeding/gains in alts in the months prior to December, but you still would have got the best price on alts if you bought in the 1st day that btc hit 19k. So in my mind, patience and riding the btc wave has a good chance at getting you closer to the bottom on alts.

"You have $10,000.  You borrow $30,000 from the broker using your $10k as collateral.  You buy 6 bitcoin with this $40,000 ($6666.66 per BTC).

You are hoping the price of bitcoin will go up.   Say it goes up to $8000, you can sell your 6 bitcoin for $48k, pay back the $30k, and are left with $10k + $8000 in profit.  (Compared to not using margin, you buy 1.5 BTC @ $6666 with your $10k and sell for $12,000 (@$8k) and only made $2k.

However, if bitcoin goes down you could be ""liquidated.""  You still owe $30,000 to your broker and have 6 BTC, so if the price drops to $5,000 your 6 BTC will be sold off (liquidated) automatically in order to pay back the $30,000 loan, and you would be left with nothing.

The amount you borrow compared to your start collateral is your Leverage.   10x leverage would be borrowing $100,000 with your $10,000.  This is more risky because you get liquidated sooner.  Same price examples, you buy 16.5 BTC with your $110k @$6666. 
You owe $100k, so your liquidation price is $100k / 16.5 BTC = $6060.   If the price drops by just 10% your position will be liquidated and you get nothing.  Before with the 3x leverage, the price needed to drop $1666 (25%) before you got rekt.

(In this post we are talking about shorts, which is the same thing but backwards.  You are borrowing bitcoin at $6666, selling it, and promising to give back bitcoin in the future.  You are hoping the price will drop so you can buy back the bitcoin at a lower price, give the BTC back, and pocket the difference.   But if the price goes up too much you'll be forced to buy the BTC at the higher price and pay it back immediately.  That's what happened this morning.)",1523539559

"No, I'm not an economist, but I play one on the Internet. I've also worked in the payments industry.

This is not a subreddit full of economists, to assume otherwise is misguided.

The discussion I was engaging in had to do with the realities of Bitcoin being used in the real world as a currency. My main point is that as long as a viable ubiquitous inflationary currency exists, deflationary assets will not have widespread adoption as as currency.

""Seeing no reason why a deflationary paradigm wouldn't work (assuming we started with it)"" is purely hypothetical and doesn't represent the state of our current economic system. I agree that it could work in an environment where a fiat, inflationary currency isn't the established de facto system for settlement, but again, that's not the world we are in.

Given the world we have, as long as the USD or other fiat remains viable and ubiquitous, I don't see a case for adoption of deflationary crypto for mainstream settlement without additional features of the crypto that can bridge this gap. The distributed and privacy features of some coins have caused adoption in some communities (e.g. Monero for use in settlement in illicit transactions) but not for reasons that will appeal to a mainstream audience.",1523539379

"&gt;difference between paying someone every day or when the contract closes

It's about risk for the exchange, not the buyer nor the seller. Let's say you buy at $10,000 and have $2,000 on account. You can cover the losses all the way to $8,000, but not more. So let's say you have a 1 month-out position. In one month, we've seen this many times with Bitcoin, the price can decrease MUCH more than 20%. Let's say that when your contract expires the price is $5,000. You're on the hook for $5,000, but you don't have that money... this leaves the exchange with $3,000 to cover. Sure, they'll start legal proceedings against you and all, and perhaps after 2yrs they'll get your $3,000. But that's costly and a pain in the neck.

How can you prevent this? You settle daily. Every day the price goes down, they take some of your money to cover the losses. Then, when the price hits $8,000, they will issue a ""margin call"" - You either put up more money (margin) to keep your position open, or they will close your position. You could meet the margin call because you think the price will recover, and if it does you're good and don't lose any money. Of course, the price could go down more and you lose more. But one thing is for sure, if you don't put up more money, you WILL lose $2,000 because they will liquidate (close) your position. 

That's the KEY difference between hodling and using futures - If you hodl, you don't incur a fiat loss until you sell, they are paper losses. (Just like they are ""paper gains"" when the price goes up... and also caveat that no one will say ""*Oh, you have 100BTC and paid $1m for it, now it's worth $10,000... but still have 100BTC, so who cares, here's your Lambo!*"") But with futures those paper losses are very real, and can be irreversible if your position gets closed.)

This brings us to the tweets from that bot. The same logic above applies in reverse - If you short Bitcoin. Then you face margin calls when the price goes up. But when the price goes up as violently as it did today, there's simply no time to put up more margin! So the exchange closes your position, and you lose your margin... all of it! If you had more time you could put up more margin and then risk even more by shorting at a higher price, so you add more sell pressure. But when it's this violent, those losses are like a lightning bolt on a clear sky, nothing can save you. 

That bot is monitoring BitMEX for shorts that are being closed. In the case above, the guy was forced to buy $9,984,230 worth of Bitcoin @ $7,650. (At least that's what those numbers mean to me.) But you don't know how much they lost since you'd need to know where they shorted, what was the selling price. But the position is pretty large, so couldn't have been a small loss. ",1523539284
"What I'm saying is:
- if BTC were only held, it's value would be zero;
- if there were no use case except trading, it's value would also go to zero over time. The circle-jerk of futures and shorts would break it, leaving only whales with nowhere to go with their coins.",1523539244

Many federal agencies freely use the term ""currency"" to describe cryptos. 

I have a feeling you are getting confused by tax treatment. For the purposes of taxation Bitcoin is treated like standard property. It does not get **foreign** currency treatment because it is not a **foreign** state issued currency. The only type of currency US tax code grants a special tax allowance to is **foreign** currency. No other types of currency are called out in the IRC thus the rest all get standard treatment.

The fact that bitcoin doesn't qualify as a **foreign** currency doesn't mean the US doesn't recognize it as a form of currency. Every US agency that has issued guidance on cryptos has used the term ""currency.""

"&gt;you know instead of saving for 20-30 years to buy a house, getting no benefit from that money all that time, and having to pay rent all that time, you can just get a mortgage and then immediately own the house and then live in it for the rest of your life while you pay off the mortgage?

You don't get it do you? I don't like the current debt based system so I refuse to borrow money from a bank to buy a house where I'd be stuck in if the housing market would collapse. I stick by my own principals and am not going to the bank to beg for their stinking money. I don't need it anyways.

&gt;you haven't said what its ""game changing"" for except ""savings"" which you can already do with anything that has higher returns than inflation.

price is the amount i have to pay to purchase single unit of product. circulation is number of units of product on the market. multiplying the two gives you a number that is totally abstract and disconnected from the real world.

Sure, there's some medium article here and there announcing some incredible news, like a big industry partnership or some big corporate funds looking to invest in crypto. But once I start looking at the details, I realize that no new money is going to pour into the market we have access to. Token X is partnering with cie Y ? It just means cie Y wants to show its shareholders they're keeping an eye on the blockchain technology, without actually spending money in it. Rumor of a billionaire family investing in bitcoin ? Actually, it's just their venture funds investing in companies that creates coins or token and sell it to the average joes.

"SunContract (SNC) - Energy trading token Competitor to power legder with a market cap of around 23 million. They enable P2P trading of buying and selling electricity. They have a platform launch on April 13th throughout Slovenia and are planning to expand throughout Europe. What I like about this coin is the experience of their team (SONCE group), partnerships with various companies in China and Europe. They have the support of Slovenian government.  This can be an easy 300 million market cap token. They are listed on Okex, Houbi and Kucoin. Feel free to go to their telegram, the admins are active there. 
Considering their experience and the amount of money they raised (2 million USD in ICO), they have done pretty good so far. 
I see people talking about PL, Grid+, Wepower etc in most crypto forms, but no one is closer to releasing the energy trading platform than SunContract. Their approach has always been product first then marketing next. Please have a look at this token when you have time.

"Dude do you know how to read charts? BTC was getting squeezed inside a large symmetric triangle. So it had to break out violently in some direction and it did just that in the upward direction.

This is not market manipulation. Many traders including me had their conditional buy orders set above the breakout zone. Some whale obviously triggered the breakout with the initial push but after that those large number of conditional buy orders executed and this was followed by liquidation of a large number of shorts. Check out BTCUSD Shorts on Bitfinex which just collapsed as many people got margin called. Everything happened in unison and this caused the violent spike.

You have to remember that the liquidity in exchanges is miniscule compared to the circulating supply. So it doesn't require billions of dollars to pump the price by $1k in 30 minutes.",1523537968

"Can you define “manipulation”? Obviously there were some large buys which triggered liquidation’s of shorts and then bots and people buying on the way up which caused even more so. Why is this so unbelievable? Do people forget that BTC reached 20k 5 months ago? 

Not every move is manipulation by one guy smoking a cigar behind a PC laughing at all the plebe. A lot of people called a rally, in fact I did myself yesterday. To be honest this is not that rare in btc in either way. Do you think all the big players in this market have each other on speed dial and coordinate all these moves? ",1523537930

"1. Investing is different than gambling. The chances are much less 50/50 depending on your knowledge of the market and different players in it. 

2. To say that markets don’t repeat themselves is pure stupidity because every single year January has been a bad month in crypto and may has been a good one. I’ll repeat what I said in a different comment, I’m not saying buy right now (although we are clearly reaching lows if we haven’t already) but am saying May could be a pretty great month based off of every year in crypto thus far.",1523537851

Whatever the catalyst is for both January being bad and May being good was just something I briefly tried to analyze. 

I thought it was very interesting a week before the major January crash this year - there was a post from a guy who showed massive sell offs in January every year in crypto and then it repeated the process one week later. I’m not saying buy buy buy if you don’t want to - even though I do think it’s stupid to argue that these aren’t lows in the market because they are, I’m just saying this could be a great month coming up based off of past Mays.",1523537659

I assume you meant statistics, not static. The funny thing is there were hardly any statistics given during this debate, it was purely political. Any time I asked people to give me an analysis of what blocksize would lead to what level of centralization people just ignored it.

Maybe they are right and increasing block size leads to more centralization but it's not a binary switch that flips from decentralized to centralized. Yet no one would provide a solid analysis of what size the block could get to before the level of centralization would be detrimental to the network.

Coinjoin was the original mixing protocol designed by BTC devs. However, there were several flaws with them. PrivateSend **fixed these flaws** using the masternode system such that saying that Dash uses coinjoin is heavily misleading and borders on deliberate lying.

It should be noted that blockchains were **originally designed** for wild and open transparency. One of the biggest purposes of BTC was so that govts didn't have a way to 'disappear' money through black budgets and 'poor accounting' etc. Privacy was actually added to Dash because Evan Duffield, the founder, saw the flaws in having mandatory transparency without optional privacy. And so privateSend was born.

That being said, coinfirm is strictly for public addresses, i.e. they use blockchains the way they were intended to be used. If you do not want your funds to be tracked BY ANYONE, use privateSend. The idea that all transactions should be private is not a founding principal of blockchains, the idea that they should be transparent, however, is.

"&gt; The internet actually works because every ISP is considered to be a good actor, 

That's a faulty assumption. Nowhere is it ever assumed every ISP is considered to be a good actor. In fact, there are a lot of bad actors among ISPs. Not only ISPs but other services as well such as DNS, governments tapping into oceanianic lines, hackers, etc.Then if you get into aditional layers, you start to run into a whole new class of attacks. For example, Tor. Malicious nodes are a great example. On the application layer you have attackers exploiting RCE. XSS, etc. There is a lot of bad out there, but good fundatmental design and security practices can actually mitigate a lot of that. Like with a well-designed VPN, you can actually avoid gov't tapping while in transit. Good endpoint security and you can prevent most attacks from compromising the traffic on either end while also protecting the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (""CIA"") of your data at rest.

A lot of people look at Bitcoin as simple and secure, and generally it is. But on a deeper level it's more complicated than most /r/btc and /r/bitcoin even understand. It's subjkect to a variety of attacks and complex mathematics. Lot of guys around here can argue about hashing power, but how many of them can actually define what information entropy is and why it's important? How many can calculate it? Not many I'd bet.

And, depending on political idealogies some want to make Bitcoin ""even better"". For some, it's LN. And LN addresses some of what they see as areas of improvement (whether others agree or not is irrelevent, since anyone is free to choose or not choose LN). With these ""enhancements"" come other considerations that need to be worked out. One of those being security. Security considerations for off-chain transactions are different than those for on-chain. Not many people understand them, so they dismiss them as overly complex and ""dumb"" But again, look at Bitcoin. When one reads the technical books, papers, etc. and has a real grasp of mathematics and cryptography princples, it's also a very complex solution. Back when Bitcoin was first annouced, it was also dismissed as overly complex and was a solution looking for a problem that didn't exist.

We're almost 10 years out. Bitcoin seems to obvious and simple, right? How many people here heard of BTC and dmissed it 8 years ago? 6 years ago? 5 years ago? Even today, I see a lot of people still dismissing it as a joke.

I'm not defending LN but just trying to open minds. But overly dismissive commets like above (""Is this seriously how it works? If so, how did this idea ever get off the ground? This is just terrible."") sound exactly like the same sorts of commets spouted off in the 80s and 90s when the Internet was gaining traction... and same with Bitcoin.

"Firstly, I can produce an article claiming the world is flat.

Secondly, let's make it clear that you have an agenda that is not truth, so let's identify what and what is not true.

https://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.9.0#rebranding-to-bitcoin-core

The actual project developers - those responsible for Bitcoin, not those who want to profit off the brand like Ver and presumably yourself - are the ones that make the decisions. They decided on Segwit, 80-90% of the community agreed (as per your own article).

Bitcoin Cash is a fork. A hard fork. Sure, you may have stayed close to the original implementation or even arguably the original Satoshi vision (news flash: over time things change, and decade plus old plans may prove inadequate) but you are not the original Bitcoin project and you should just accept that.

The world recognises your project as Bitcoin Cash. Your ticker ID is BCH. That will not change, no matter how much you all cry about it. All you do is fuel the ""toxic"" atmosphere you complain about because you are being toxic yourselves.

I know many of you stand to make insane amounts of money if BCH becomes the official Bitcoin, but that ship has sailed mate. Get over it.",1523535017
A recession is inevitable... but having all your eggs in one basket is always dangerous!  Crypto isn't a silver bullet and it didn't exist in the last crash \- so no telling what is going to happen to prices of crypto in an economic recession...

There's a conspiracy theory claiming that exchanges are unhappy with the volume and are forcing the price down or up to their will in order to increase volume and liquidate margin traders. Bitcoin just went up 1k in an hour. And it will slowly or quickly drop back down over the next few hours. ,1523534930

"There is some bullshit in the video indeed, such as the fork thing. Not that forking from Doge would be worse than what Verge actually is, a copy/paste of multiple other coins such as Novacoin, Peercoin, Bitcoin, Opalcoin, Myriadcoin etc etc.

He also does point out some good info such as the Mcafee incident, the fact that Verge uses false marketing ""the only untraceable cryptocurrency"" when it is know to actually not have a working privacy feature and is by far the worst one out there. His interpretation of the whole fake protocol ""Wraith"" hype was both hilarious and true.

The ip thing might have been a bad example but it still puts focus on the fact that Verge is in every way failed as a privacy coin. I wish he would have gotten the reasons right but still, good that someone is countering the false marketing and the point in the end holds true, Verge is not a privacy coin. TOR-wallet is nothing new, it wasn't invented by Verge and it can be used with pretty much any cryptocurrency.

Also he didn't lie about the funds for the partnership. Perhaps some kind of crowdfunding system already existed but Verge expicitly asked for a certain sum of money to disclose the partnership, only to postpone it, that much is true.
I call bullshjit on the explanation of miscommunication/misunderstanding in your link, it's not the first time Verge uses that excuse to cover up shady practices.
The fact that the link says ""enjoy backing your dying currency Monero"" without any kind of referense, should give a clue that the person who wrote the message isn't being honest and most likely has a stake in Verge.

The ""give us money for some bla bla bla groundbreaking stuff"" is actually spot on for Verge. It is the way Verge creates hype many times. Yet so far Verge has done absolutely nothing with that hype. Verge still does nothing that can't be donewith Bitcoin or any of the other clones out there.

The part of how shady the marketing video is, is also spot on. That is a huge red flag. People putting money in to a box..lol the whole thing ""donate to the cause"", that video was a huge red flag and props to Polk for pointing it out. The prices were also complete bullshit, a mug, a skype call with Justin the criminal stoner dude or a thank you note....

The analysis of both the videos with Sune was also spot on, massive warning sign.

Verge got hacked, that is a fact, it wasn't a 51% attack but does it really matter? The point still stands. It was a massive hack, a disaster and Sune downplayed it and had trouble fixing it so it took a long time. No surprize since Sune has proven time and time again that he can only copy code, he doesn't really understand it very well.

You also hold your own private keys, meaning you have full control of your funds all the time!

It will also introduce a copy-trader system where you can pay (BPT) to follow/copy an experienced trader’s moves and execute them. You can allocate a certain % of your holdings to use.

The Mycelium wallet possibly has the best and most progressive Bitcoin key management system. These highlights must be empowered by going into settings and allowing Expert Mode — yet once switched on, it permits streamlined management of a wide range of Bitcoin addresses.
It’s simple to make another address for personal use, or import existing private keys keeping in mind the end goal to spend Bitcoin from Mycelium. There are a few unique techniques for bringing in keys — Mycelium can scan a QR code, duplicate an address from the device’s clipboard, or import a backup from the ""Bitcoin Wallet"" customer. 
Mycelium still has assistance for Bitcoin watch-only addresses whose balances can be checked, however not spent from. This enables the intriguing capability to “stalk” another person's Bitcoin address, and monitor their money — or basically monitor one’s own particular address without expecting to spend the cash from Mycelium.

"This is why people who are only invested in one asset are poor investors generally -- and why those of us with balanced portfolios typically do well with volatility.

I've been using a ""rebalance without usually selling"" portfolio action for 26 years, including bitcoin since 2012.  I dollar cost average weekly into my portfolio, shoring up whatever is the weakest as a percentage of my portfolio.  In situations where one particular market gets extremely volatile, I will have to sell down that asset to rebalance.

I've only had to sell bitcoin thrice in those 5ish years -- once at $900, once just under $3000, and once at the end of December 2018.  Each time, my crypto 6% position was way over 12%, so I sold down to 6% to rebalance my portfolio and used the profits to shore up other positions.

Naturally I always continue to buy-in weekly (dollar cost average style) and 2018 hasn't really been that bad in crypto to be honest.  Yeah, my 2018 positions are down around 11% right now overall, but that's not really much of a problem because as the price falls (versus my entire portfolio), I buy more crypto during the low points, which has offset some of the earlier losses as a percentage of portfolio growth/loss.

I don't look at my non-fiat positions as money I am owed, until I cash out, which right now is either 20 years away, or whenever some position I have goes too heavy and I liquidate to rebalance.  Which in 5ish years happened just 3 times.

"Firstly I am not affiliated with Bitcoin in any way so don't say I stole anything because I have no say whatsoever and haven't done anything beyond reading about both sides of this debate.

You can't claim Bitcoin Core stole the name from you. You simply tried to fork Bitcoin, and thus created the new currency yourself. You then tried to profit off of it by trying to BE bitcoin when it is not owned by you, you just had the ownership of a few public places. If you owned the Bitcoin name then you would own Bitcoin and your project would be BTC. It isn't. Accept it. Be proud of your fork.",1523534224

This goes against open innovation, plus if we can do atomic swaps it creates a whole new world of possibilities, increases anonimity, etc.

Bitcoin has an advantage because it is the most secure and decentralised coin and Lightning will work best on Bitcoin thanks to that.

"developers cant force changes unto users, but they can disrupt the market. Eg create a hardfork that activates in 6 months with a change some members of the community dont want. 

This could result in a coin split which will cause disruption in the market and a fight over the name 'bitcoin-cash'. One of the forks would need to change address formats and it could generally damage both communities. 

&gt;I doubt that would ever happen. You don't get much relief from statistical variance on a sub 1% pool.

The point i was trying to make was - in the situation where the majority of the hashpower cannot be directly approached scheduling a hardfork and hoping everyone upgrades by a certain date would not be feasible. 

admittedly the old bitcoin DAA made nakamoto activated HF's safe because the rules only change when the majority of the hashpower signaled for the change.  Any minority change would not grow and die off.  

With the new DAA i guess its not so important to activate new rules based on block signaling  - but I think at the very least it would be nice to see how much support there is for the new rules before the fork.",1523532654

"**Scuttlebutt**

Scuttlebutt in slang usage means rumor or gossip, deriving from the nautical term for the cask used to serve water (or, later, a water fountain).

The term corresponds to the colloquial concept of a water cooler in an office setting, which at times becomes the focus of congregation and casual discussion. Water for immediate consumption on a sailing ship was conventionally stored in a scuttled butt: a butt (cask) which had been scuttled by making a hole in it so the water could be withdrawn. Since sailors exchanged gossip when they gathered at the scuttlebutt for a drink of water, scuttlebutt became Navy slang for gossip or rumours.

"&gt; Monero's single point of failure is regulatory moves. 

If that is now a point of failure, than your Ripple might aswell be just as exposed to this failure as Monero/Bitcoin are too. 


When originally however it used to be more of a case that it's irrelevant whether or not a state claims that coin is now illegal, because cryptos shouldn't care about this - because they're decentralized. Ripple abides, Monero just shifts into areas, where it still works. 


Whether that's a different country, or just OTH/blackmarket trades is irrelevant. 


&gt; Meanwhile your coin helps illegal activities.  

So does the computer I use help me find these pages, where I can buy all sorts of drugs I want. So does the electricity support all of my wrongdoings aswell. Monero is just the tool and your argument is now pretty much ""I have nothing to hide - thus privacy is not required"". Dumbest average mindset I've yet to come across, when it comes to privacy. 


&gt; (guess that's why 9 alts out of 10 [...] 

Another questionable argument. Decentralization is a *goal* for many Altcoins, but since many of them are new, it's not yet doable, specially if they're not ASIC resistant. They aim to be decentralized - but are not yet, because they're just too small to be decentralized to begin with. 


The thing is with Ripple, is that Ripple will never even try to be decentralized. That's a totally different thing. 



And why did you dodge the LTC question? I'll give you benefit of doubt and say you overlooked it maybe? If transaction speed and cost are priority, why is Litecoin not as good Ripple? 


&gt; Decentralized systems tend toward centralization naturally overtime 


That's made up science you believe in and came straight out of your ass. Most experts in the field I know would claim bullshit, but I will again give you the benefit of the doubt and if you want you can link me to a source and I'll maybe reevaluate.

Sadly this is more interesting right now than discussing with you. Clearly I mean you no harm. I am not a fan of Ripple as you can tell. 


I've just always asked myself, if people claim cheap tx and speed are so relevant, then why exactly do they use Ripple, BCH, Stellar, if Litecoin does it without being a pile of shit? TX in Moner is high, but you get something in return, which is privacy. If you want cheap TX, Monero is not for you, I totally get it. ",1523532418

But there'll be no need in *bitcoin* either because of Gersham's Law...,1523532114
It's so easy to trash talk Bitcoin Cash. So glad there are people like Craig Wright that are spending every waking moment making BCH more and more powerful.,1523532042
"People are going to liquidate and spend their most Inflationary assets - this has always been the case and I don't see why this would change. As long as an inflationary currency exists and is widely held and accepted, ithe general trend will be spend before a deflationary asset.

There may be periods where this trend attempts to wax and wane, but the inertia of the marketplace to invest in technology to accept multiple currencies will work to prevent this trend.

There's also demand built into the system with a bias towards fiat, as it is required for settling transactions with the government.

The case for spending deflationary assets rests on the relevancy, viability and availability of inflationary currency. Cash is everywhere. The US Government is printing it as fast as possible, which has the effect of making it both ubiquitious and inflationary - at least while inflation isn't in the late stages of exponential growth.

I'm a fan of the idea that the Federal Reserve should issue fiat-backed blockchain cryptodollars, 1-for1, pinned to USD. It would make technology for blockchain settlement of transactions go mainstream, bringing crypto to retail, p2p, and b2b transactions. Other crypto could ride on the coattails of this technology rollout while getting the public familiar with spending with the blockchain. Unfortunately, this would be a direct competitor to entrenched interests (Visa, MC, AmEx), so it isn't going to be allowed to happen.

Regarding your point of a fixed rate issue of currency not necessarily being deflationary, I'd agree. The deflationary nature of an asset in this context is based not just on supply, but also demand. If the perceived long-term trend is supply &lt;&lt; demand, the asset will be treated as deflationary. If fixed supply is much less than demand, inflationary.

I think the a fiat system has the advantage in this situation vs. an algorithmic creation of currency that doesn't actively create a bias for slight inflation. The unfortunate nature of fiat is that the supply is often exploited by the issuing government.

In short, I don't see how a deflationary asset outspends a viable inflationary one. When the viability of the prevailing inflationary currency is challenged though, that can change.

In very short - when USD fails, the largest adopted, least deflationary alternative gets treated as currency.",1523532023
"The sample does not take into consideration the exponential growth of the blockchain since 2013. In November of 2017 a case is made that an investment sold in mid/late January made 2400 % . Notwithstanding the diversity of projects today are more then just clones of bitcoin. The incredible increase mentioned above, although opposite of buying high and hodling, still reflect potential of any coin and the general inclination of large independent growth. 

I am not sure you would be correct even if someone were to buy 10 of the least expensive ETH pairs on Binance today and held for 4 years. Even after sorting out the losers in that time the potential of the few winners is much greater then days gone by. 

A new paradigm exist today that comes with the growth of many new developments in blockchain and the growth of incoming/potential investors. ",1523531999

"**2014 Hong Kong protests**

A series of sit-in street protests, often called the Umbrella Revolution (Chinese: 雨傘革命; Sidney Lau: Yue5saan3 gaak3meng6; pinyin: Yǔsǎn gémìng) and sometimes used interchangeably with Umbrella Movement (Chinese: 雨傘運動; Sidney Lau: Yue5saan3 wan6dung6; pinyin: Yǔsǎn yùndòng), occurred in Hong Kong from 26 September to 15 December 2014. The protests began after the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) issued a decision regarding proposed reforms to the Hong Kong electoral system. The decision was widely seen to be highly restrictive, and tantamount to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)'s pre-screening of the candidates for the leader of Hong Kong.

Students led a strike against the NPCSC's decision beginning on 22 September 2014, and the Hong Kong Federation of Students and Scholarism started protesting outside the government headquarters on 26 September 2014.

most people buy AML/KYC coins ie their outputs have their identify associated with them. Therefore as soon as they make a crypto to crypto txn they have an unrealized gain but pay CGT. If the crypto they bought tanks then then cannot sell it to pay the tax.

"**Global spread of the printing press**

The global spread of the printing press began with the invention of the printing press with movable type by Johannes Gutenberg in Mainz, Germany c. 1439. Western printing technology was adopted in all world regions by the end of the 19th century, displacing the manuscript and block printing.

In the Western world, the operation of a press became synonymous with the enterprise of publishing and lent its name to a new branch of media, the ""press"" (see List of the oldest newspapers).

**History of the Internet**

The history of the Internet begins with the development of electronic computers in the 1950s. Initial concepts of wide area networking originated in several computer science laboratories in the United States, United Kingdom, and France. The US Department of Defense awarded contracts as early as the 1960s, including for the development of the ARPANET project, directed by Robert Taylor and managed by Lawrence Roberts. The first message was sent over the ARPANET in 1969 from computer science Professor Leonard Kleinrock's laboratory at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) to the second network node at Stanford Research Institute (SRI).

"Margin trading is basically loaning you money to trade with. Shorting is betting on an asset to go down in price. I'm not sure how exactly it works because I've never done it, but here's the basics. Let's say you want to short with $100, but on 10x margin. You would basically be playing with $1000. The problem is being liquidated - if price goes in the opposite direction, the exchange forces you to close your position (so the exchange doesn't lose any money themselves, only you. house always wins)

Let's say that BTC is at 7k and you open up a 10x short with $100. You are betting on the price to go down. But if Bitcoin goes up $10, you can get liquidated. How? You're doing 10x margin so every $10 move is like $100, which is the total amount that you put in the game yourself. Meaning, the exchange would liquidate you to save their own ass. You would be out $100.

Needless to say, Margin trading is basically gambling",1523529846

"Good on you mate for coming in here. Hopefully it will stop another newbie from being brainwashed by the Core propaganda. My experience was similar. 

I had a frustrating time trying to transfer Bitcoins at the time. I realized there was a problem with Bitcoin. I read further and found that that was the same frustration and problem that Bitcoin Cash was wanting to solve. So I could see that they had a rational reason to fork because that is the only way they could work with Bitcoin. I read the whitepaper and Satoshi anticipated that Bitcoin will never be captured because as soon as it did so, other people can always fork the coin. Eventually the label Bitcoin goes to the one that most people realize is closer to the real Bitcoin. 

The way pro Core accounts on Twitter and YouTube made Bitcoin Cash to be this evil, yucky thing you shouldn't touch at all just didn't match with what I was reading about the reasons why BCH was actually being forced to split because it wanted to make Bitcoin usable. ",1523529654

"New the Bitcoin world so just getting my head around it and was hoping someone could let me know if what im thinking is right. 

So based on the original whitepaper Bitcoin is a system of electronic cash that allows for peer to peer payments meaning we dont need paypal for example . Its my understanding that the way paypal works or any trusted third party payment provider works is like below 

In a normal situation where two people wish to send money to each other over the internet they use a trusted third party such as PayPal. The reason that they use a trusted third party is to ensure that the money being transferred is actually transferred and received. If we take the example of Alice sending money to Bob Paypal would credit Alices account of they money and then debit it to Bobs account. PayPal creates a record of this process ensuring the neither party can later claim that payment wasn’t sent or received. If PayPal didn’t exist Alice could tell Bob she issued payment without actually having done so or Bob could claim payment was never received. This allows for Alice to double spend the money she owes or for Bob to request double payment. PayPal acts as an intermediator to the transaction charging a fee for the service of providing payment transfer. 

With Bitcoin payments are peer to peer meaning no trusted third party is used. Instead of paypal confirming transactions and creating a record of payment and receipt this is all done in an automated way with transactions being grouped together to form blocks and blocks being linked together in a sequential chain that can only be added to and once added to cant be altered. 

Transactions are confirmed once a block has been created and added to the blockchain. For a block to be created people have to expended computational power looking to solve for a nonce value. The nonce value is a value that gives a blocks header a certain value but im not sure what this value is .

Could someone please explain what a nonce is and tell me if I am on the right track  in terms of paypal versus bitcoin? ",1523529564
"Another point: atomic swaps plus being able to use more than one crypto on lightning effectively eliminates bitcoin's scarcity, because, while the supply of BTC or BCH tokens may be limited, there is no limit to the number of tokens one could exchange on lightning.

"I can echo OP's comments.  I'm also fairly new to the crypto space I was unsure about the fork last year and didn't pay much attention to BCH, keeping my position in BTC.  I kept hearing all the talk about Roger being a criminal scammer and CSW being a fraud.  So I did my research.  And I found out that in my opinion it's pretty unlikely CSW wasn't at least involved in the satoshi crew. I couldn't understand the simplicity of the denial from BTC about him.  He's a fake.  That seems to be the extent of their argument. Oh and because he didn't *proove* it by signing with satoshi keys, he can't have the keys.  Flawed logic.

And I watched videos of Roger - he had a consistent and sensible message.  I wasn't hearing anything but 'we've got the best coders' 'we're the real bitcoin' and they're all scammers from BTC core.  I looked into the LN - it appears to have quite a few issues, mostly usability.  Locking up coins in a channel? Really, who wants to be doing that?

I'm left wondering if there's any end to the warring between BCH and BTC.  It seems like there's too much acrimonious water under the bridge for any kind of real peace.  My suggestion is a truce, given all the bitching is not a good look to outsiders.  And we want outsiders to be drawn in, not put off.  But that seems impossible as egos are quite large in the crypto space.",1523526647

You can either come up with a different way to make your own video codec in the blockchain or you can fork before the codec is implemented in the next hardfork. You cannot patent codes or copyright Bitcoin, but you can patent your method of performing a function which may be very efficient and better than your competitors, forcing them to think of other ways to perform the same function but using different methods. Your worry is irrelevant as the patents don't apply to old BCH versions who doesn't have the same method as stated in the patent. Do some simple googling and read it up.",1523526636

"Without disagreeing with any of your points, it’s still not backwards.  The fact that anything about bitcoin could be decided by 8 miners is a basic flaw of bitcoin itself, and has been wrestled with on both sides.  There are no binding players where an ‘agreement’ should even be a thing except, again, outside of bitcoins core decentralized platform.  Blockstream has a conflict of interest, bitmain has a conflict of interest, I suggest Roger Ver has a conflict of interest...if bitcoin can’t survive conflicts of interest, then it has a problem.

If there’s any problem I have with core, it’s that no one is competition, and big players are treating it as though it’s similar to games they’ve played before.  Instead of treating it as a huge decentralizing, disruptive technology with the potential to be world changing, they’re looking at short and medium term money grabs, with a quick turnaround and small player devs they just give instructions to, a deadline with their list of demands, and a tantrum when they don’t get their way.  What they need to be doing is spending time building teams, building test nets that compete with anyone, not ones designed to convince the next round of shareholders that they’ll get in on the ground floor of the next cash grab, and then off to the next coin when and if this one shows signs of being frustratingly harder to control than they expected.",1523525925

**Decentralized websites using Bitcoin crypto and the BitTorrent network - https://zeronet.io**


**Why?**

* We believe in open, free, and uncensored network and communication.
* No single point of failure: Site remains online so long as at least 1 peer is serving it.
* No hosting costs: Sites are served by visitors.
* Impossible to shut down: It's nowhere because it's everywhere.
* Fast and works offline: You can access the site even if Internet is unavailable.

**Features**

* Real-time updated sites
* Namecoin .bit domains support
* Easy to setup: unpack &amp; run
* Clone websites in one click
* Password-less BIP32 based authorization: Your account is protected by the same cryptography as your Bitcoin wallet
* Built-in SQL server with P2P data synchronization: Allows easier site development and faster page load times
* Anonymity: Full Tor network support with .onion hidden services instead of IPv4 addresses
* TLS encrypted connections
* Automatic uPnP port opening
* Plugin for multiuser (openproxy) support
* Works with any browser/OS

**How does it work?**

* After starting zeronet.py you will be able to visit zeronet sites using http://127.0.0.1:43110/{zeronet_address} (eg. http://127.0.0.1:43110/1HeLLo4uzjaLetFx6NH3PMwFP3qbRbTf3D).
* When you visit a new zeronet site, it tries to find peers using the BitTorrent network so it can download the site files (html, css, js...) from them.
* Each visited site is also served by you.
* Every site contains a content.json file which holds all other files in a sha512 hash and a signature generated using the site's private key.
* If the site owner (who has the private key for the site address) modifies the site, then he/she signs the new content.json and publishes it to the peers. Afterwards, the peers verify the content.json integrity (using the signature), they download the modified files and publish the new content to other peers.

Bitcoin Cash adheres to the white paper more closely, and is better in that respect, but that is at least in part because they didn’t do much.  Other groups who did try doing things along the line of Core did it quickly and poorly.

First of all, the network topology for secure instant (&lt;2 seconds) payments is only incentivized in mined coins. Proof of stake, etc. doesn't result in the all-to-all configurations wth fat pipes. Without this, it takes much longer to determine whether there is a definitive first-seen for a given transaction.

Secondly, BIP70 allows the merchant to be the one to push the transaction to the network, which means an attacking consumer doesn't get the advantage of determining the timing. 

Third, and this is *only* applicable to BCH, the embrace of the original Bitcoin huge blocks vision forces miners to compete fiercely not only on hashpower but also on connectivity and bandwidth. Besides the decentralizing effect of this, it also ensures even faster and more universal determination of definitive first- and second-seen transactions, making instant payments (0-conf) even faster - that is, the merchant need wait even less time before releasing the goods, likely under a second for anything up to the price of a new car.

“In March-April 2013, the value of Bitcoin spiked by almost 700% in Cyprus when capital controls were introduced in the country, limiting the amount which citizens could withdraw from their accounts.” 

So many ask what would happen to crypto if the dollar crashed. I think there would be an inverse relationship between dollar/bitcoin price, as trust would be transferred to the decentralized, global level of security. I’m expecting an economic crash in USA between 1-2 years from now (longest we’ve had without a recession is 10 years; we have one on average every 5 years; we’re going on year 10). My logic is sound. 

I’m investing heavily into cryptocurrency. I think we’ll see an initial drop followed by a massive spike in price in economic crashes, as we’ve seen before in Greece.

"&gt; Can you understand now why to me, just blindly trusting that ""economic incentives will just keep everyone honest"", is simply not enough, in matters that could potentially be fixable at the protocol level?

Yes. I wasn't even arguing against fixing this (though I think we have time still and should be careful), but rather saying this isn't a really *fundamental* problem with Bitcoin.

I was trying to say that ""Selfish mining breaks the 50% assumption of the current implementation"" not ""Selfish mining fundamentally breaks Bitcoin"".



&gt; Of course we need to study all the options and make sure we don't break other things at the same time, but surely a paralising fear of moving a single inch from the original complete incentives scheme shouldn't really be our guiding force. As it shouldn't be mantra. Nor faith.

Tbh, I think there's some inescapable faith involved with Bitcoin. The 50% majority faith is hard to circumvent, but IMO boils down to variants of the usual ""might makes right and it is basically impossible to go squarely againt a majority in nature"" observation about the real world. But to apply that generalization to Bitcoin does require some faith, IMO :)

The thing is about Bitcoin Cash, that there's a very vile stigma attached to it. That comes from a lot of things, which are seen by an outsider/altcoiner like this : 


- BCH hijacked the BTC sub and abuse it. Ver is moderator. 

- BCH is associated with Ver, who sold fireworks and went to jail. Who values a person by how much money they made. 

- BCH is backed by Bitmain. My monero people just did real work and fucked the monopoly pretty much in the ass. 

- fake Satoshi being associated with BCH. 

- then you have threads like this being a real-time example, of how vile BCH people are. You are totally ruffled. Other people in here are ruffled, and whenever people talk about BCH, they immediately proceed to bash Bitcoin and how it sucks, as if their own version couldn't stand on its own merits. Why not just celebrate something good for BCH and leave it at that? Ver got TV time on Bloomberg, that's good right? Why is there so much anger? 



You're really not more but a small piss in the ocean. You don't have to push your political agenda everywhere you go. It makes you a sad person. Just calm down. Time will tell who is right, and if you think BCH will win, then surely you have invested in the correct coin? So why worry?

"This is true.  The simplest possible network is N=2 nodes.  There routing is trivially solved and your confidence that unexpected failures occur drops to 0.

As N gets larger and larger and there are potentially more hops between you and the destination, and especially if there is actual activity on the network (where routes chance due to balances moving back and forth very quickly), the probability of failure increases dramatically.

Ironically Lightning has its own scaling problem just like Bitcoin BTC.  If it actually becomes popular, it will become increasingly unstable and unusable with increasingly high failure rates.  

Bitcoin BTC has the same problem (because blocksize cap).

Lightning has this problem because routing problem is unsolved.

The ""solution"" for the routing problem is to not have it be a mesh network but instead do a hub-and-spoke model where many nodes are connected to highly liquid central hubs (thus routing is trivially easy -- just send to the hub and let the hub take care of it).

"It doesn't work like this, the price movements are driven by the volume. This is true for every coin out there (or the stock market, it's the same): bigger is the volume, harder would be to move the price. Normally the volume is tied to the market capitalization, but it's not always true: if you fork a shitcoin from the Bitcoin, it has the same circulation and market capitalization of the Bitcoin at the fork time, but it goes suddenly to zero, because the low volume will make only few person (traders) to determine the price.

The price of each coin (and the circulation) means nothing, it's merely a divider. What it counts is the market capitalization and the volume: higher the market capitalization is, higher the transaction volumes are, more stable the price will be (because it'll be harder to move it).",1523521282

"&gt; &gt; I suggest you perform a cursory attempt at understanding Lightning before claiming it can't work.

I have.  I've read the whitepaper dozens of times.  I know how payment channels work.   

&gt;  It's no skin off my teeth, but it does make you look like an ignorant fool.

Ad hominums are easy.  Arguments/demonstrations/evidence is  hard.

Lets talk about the scenario given in the video:

Adam has a channel open with WalStore, with 0.1 BTC on adams side.  Adam has a channel open with Pat for 0.1BTC on Pat's side.

Adam has routing enabled, but Pat has only the channel open with Adam, and nobody else. (at least publically).

Pat spends 0.1BTC at WalStore.   It routes through Adam.  Now the balance in pat's channel with adam is still 0.1 but it's on adams side.  However, Adam's channel with WalStore has the 0.1 on WalStore's side.

Adam wants to now spend the 0.1 BTC in his wallet at WalStore.  Let's look at his options.

&gt; You can still send payment from the other channel, 

Okay, Adam tries to spend out of his channel with Pat to WalStore.  However, he can't, because Pat has no public routes to WalStore except going through Adam, and that channel is already filled.  Payment fails.

&gt; if you wanted to, find a route between your two channels and move the funds back.

Again, Pat has no unfilled public routes to anyone, and the only channel to adam is filled, so this doesn't work either. Payment failed.

The only way for Adam to pay is to open an on-chain transaction to fund another channel with WalStore or someone publically connected to WalStore.  

Am I incorrect?  Please explain how. (Try to avoid name-calling if you can, it makes explanations easier to understand).  

If I'm correct, then from Adam's perspective, he needs to open a channel with WalStore on chain and pay the fee and wait.  So he does.  He enables public routing because he wants to be a good citizen of the network.  Then, by the time he gets to the store, because of his good karmic act, he has to fill the channel on-chain.  

So, why am I wrong here?  How would adam fix his problem without using an on-chain channel refill in the topology described?  Can you quote the LN whitepaper?",1523519846

Madoff is an American drama television miniseries, written by Ben Robbins, inspired by Brian Ross' book The Madoff Chronicles, about the Madoff investment scandal. The Madoff investment scandal was a fraud scheme perpetrated by Bernard Madoff, a former stockbroker, investment advisor, and financier. He is the former non-executive chairman of the NASDAQ stock market and the admitted operator of a Ponzi scheme that is considered the largest financial fraud in U.S. history. The miniseries aired over two nights, February 3 and 4, 2016, on ABC.

"So I would consider myself on the ‘core’ side, but see obvious, more immediate benefits with BCH.  I feel pretty open minded, but see way more ‘bashing’ than benefits coming from either side.  With whatever little credibility you can attribute to me, I swear I’m not a troll for anyone.

With that said, my view was that increasing the block-size was a necessary fix on btc around the time of the fork, but one that wasn’t necessary as immediately as ver insisted, and that the conversation and planning for one was sidetracked and ultimately derailed because of the insistence that it be done before segwit, even to the point of forking instead of waiting.

I understand that the general feeling is that Core was entrenched and trolled and censored and generally commandeered discussions, but even at the time, I felt perfectly comfortable discussing the benefits of a reasonable block-size increase, but even I argued against an increase being considered ‘the’ fix.  It’s far too late, but my gut was telling me that, consensus-wise, the direction was segwit, so they could work on sidechain stuff to allow some easing of network stuff that didn’t need to be network stuff, then block-size increase to provide a little breathing room for on chain transactions...basically to allow ‘other’ avenues for bitcoin use while the legitimate blocksize issues were addressed simultaneously.

My take on Ver is, and has always been, that he was interested in bitcoin can do for him ‘now’, not what it could do in the future.  I realize this could be the result of an impassioned supported who simply comes across as a little overzealous, but it’s also how a self interested con man comes across, and I can’t help but feel that people ar glad he’s on their side because he seems to get results even if they’re a little queasy about how he’s getting them.  ‘He’ had a lot riding on immediate bitcoin adoption, even if a more shallow slope would have been smarter, and he bullied and argued anyone who he viewed as getting in his way.  There were many people like him who were impatient for bitcoin to fly, while many other people were convinced we were getting a good running start, but were nowhere the ‘just flip a bit’ for the blocksize increase and ‘trust us, everything will be fine’ state.  Being on the development side of other projects, Ver reminds me of nothing more than a boss who’s over promised and now is telling his guys to ‘ship what they got’ while Core was in the unenviable position of knowing there was more work to do to avoid shipping a product that wasn’t as simple to fix as a quick blocksize increase, having the ‘power’ to say no, and being the only Dev team with enough experience to do the thing right, but not enough charm to explain themselves.

As far as core censorship, I feel a good chunk of that was the fact that most of them are devs, had a plan in mind to solve every problem in the world, but not immediately and not in the order everyone wanted, and their strength was in development, not politics.  I think they, correctly, believed that is they did a blocksize increase first, they would never get buyin for what they believed was more important and, right or wrong, decided their only hope was to push segwit first, but honesty would have worked on a block-size increase after to appease everyone else, and then instead of developing anything, got drug into 9 months of defense against 1 hard fork and at least one, maybe two, threatened ones, so there is literally no way anyone could say one way or another what they would have actually worked on.  Throw in there others members who weren’t any good at politics and probably clung desperately to bad tools of that trade (censorship, trolling, whatever) and we have the shit show mud flinging and two, almost three chains, we have today.",1523519251

But I think it's a different story if someone in 2018 talks about ""You don't need Bitcoin to use Lightning"" because the assumption is completely different. A couple of years ago if someone said that, it would not boe so ""controversial"" per se, because everyone assumed Bitcoin would keep scaling somehow and would remain the most dominant (near 90%) chain.

What about the coverage of Hal Finney on the banking on Bitcoin documtary who interviewed the guy. He seems convinced that he's not. Hal Finney was apparently amused at the idea and what about the exchanges between Hal and Satoshi? Are you saying he was talking to himself all along?,1523518352

We'll get there. Ultimately we cannot go too much lower because anybody with a brain will buy the shit out of 5k btc. After that the best profits will be made in going long. That's where we'll pump. Btc 30k eoy. ",1523518193
"&gt; since people like this guy now openly talks about Lightning without Bitcoin, and Lightning using other protocols than Bitcoin.

Very early on when LN was proposed, they already started openly talking about this idea.

It was one of the points that set off suspicion. LN was put out with the whitepaper basing it on Bitcoin. But then you had these LN advocates (developers) who said it could also be used on other coins.

We pushed them on this question, and got confirmation that LN was going to be essentially agnostic to layer 1.

Then out came the atomic swaps with LTC, VTC, etc. and the spreading of Segwit to as many altcoins as they could muster, with this obvious goal, to be able to support the LN .

So anyone who's been paying attention has seen this coming down the road for the last few years.",1523518157
"This is why crypto can't break the big league.

We are essentially a FINANCE MEME.

Seriously.... the internet culture intertwined too heavily with this crypto thing and now we will come to realize that this will be very difficult to shed. AND shed it we must in order to be the global NEW SYSTEM OF EXCHANGE that this aims (or is pretending) to be.

It's a vicious cycle though. MEMES are funny but also they are a coping mechanism for those who day in and day out live this thing. Just like a bored kid in school... his desk gets more and more scribbles and engravings as the year goes on... ONLY because he/she paid no attention to the actual reason for their existence there repeatedly over that table.

This is us... we miss OUR SHINY THING... 

So... what is my message...
Fcken I don't know... I'm just as lost as you are.
EOS pumped today though and I had a feeling it would so I feel well rewarded now for that feeling... so now I must go and make many EOS MOON memes!! It's the law!!",1523518111
"LOL....Yes, I'm tired of typing it over and over as I move from on Reddit topic to the next. It's easier to just cut-n-paste (with tweaks here and there). What I was referring to by mass adoption with respects to Bitcoin was is how it so many were proclaiming that it was supposedly going to be like Visa motto, ""Everywhere you want to be"" and how that really hasn't manifested into a reality, again due to scalability issues and regulatory compliance.",1523518086
