"I support BCH entirely and even subscribe to the notion that Cash is the original Bitcoin project and chain \(not here to argue about that\), but even I thought this was childish on Roger's part. Many other BCH supporters I think agreed as well which is in part why I think it was changed back to Bitcoin Cash, along with the lawsuit which even if bogus would have been expensive and time consuming to fight. 

I hate that the Bitcoin name got hijacked for Blockstream's frankencoin, but the entire ecosystem calls it Bitcoin and it just is what it is now. Unfortunately they won that fight. It is somewhat deceiving  and confusing to label BCH as just Bitcoin for new users of [Bitcoin.com](https://Bitcoin.com) when the rest of the ecosystem does not subscribe to that idea. He still has BTC listed as Bitcoin Core, which may be still distasteful to some but not technically inaccurate either. BCH already has enough of an identity crisis without this nonsense already between braindead ""bcash"" parrots and other anti\-BCH narratives.

Neither coin deserves to use *Bitcoin* alone to me at least. The chain split, and the name should split in no different a fashion as Debian Linux and Ubuntu Linux. *Bitcoin* is a whitepaper describing a protocol, not a brand name that belongs to anyone as a public property. 

I appreciate Roger's continued fight and passion against the hijacking of BTC by Blockstream \(the BTC he built his business on which Blockstream was threatening, you're damn right he pushed back and still does\), but he's really not doing BCH any favors playing this game. ",1525329616

I acutely disagree that an art or invention or anything anyone cones up with is their intellectual property. There's a reason anarchists have a categorical problem with private property. And come to the third world, we always share our inventions unless first blocked by the west. I truly hope we get back to associating creative property with social movements and times of civilizational progress rather than one persons personal property to do anything with. Its simply not. Everyone has been involved in making everything, and I think if its access is cut off to some people due to geo political reasons they absolutely have every right to access it for free.

"Yes this is sad, but remember that Satoshi did an astonishing job designing the way to bootstrap this revolution. He was well aware that greed would be one of the most powerful drivers for something like this.

"He makes a good point about how he recommends bitcoin cash to newbies because it's so easier to get started.

If you think about this for a sec, this is actually a super powerful feature. Think about the last time you recommended someone to buy BTC. The only reason someone would ever buy BTC is for investment. But this ""investment"" is pretty hard to understand for normal people. For most people it feels like some pyramid scheme (This is the same for BCH as well).

So when you think about recommending someone to try using a crypto, a purely speculative asset like BTC has low viral coefficient. People are not willing to recommend BTC to other normal friends who don't completely understand the value of BTC because they don't want to ruin their friendship.

But when it comes to money that they can immediately use, it's a different story because it's no longer a speculative asset. I feel much more comfortable recommending my friends to try using BCH NOT as an investment vehicle but to actually buy stuff. Once they try using it they will immediately get the value, and then they also will start looking into the speculative investment aspect and of course they will buy more.",1525326793

I originally tried this back in January, though, focusing on hodling, and bought the top alts in small amounts only to see each plummet. Fortunately, with the recent upward movements, I finally got back the ETH I invested in TRON with a 2.2% profit, though over 3 months.

I've got a strategy, been testing it out on small values, and ready to try it out on $100 buys instead of $10 buys, aiming at small gains in short time.",1525326651

A triplestore or RDF store is a purpose-built database for the storage and retrieval of triples through semantic queries. A triple is a data entity composed of subject-predicate-object, like ""Bob is 35"" or ""Bob knows Fred"".

Much like a relational database, one stores information in a triplestore and retrieves it via a query language. Unlike a relational database, a triplestore is optimized for the storage and retrieval of triples.

You're ignoring the fact that there is a wide, wide world of sports out there, and that Bitcoin, *even in a worst case scenario*, will only ever have 21,000,000 whole-units available.

Plus there was the ICO and premine. Things that were highly frowned upon in those days. Counterparty had an ICO but burned all the funds because the thought of a project raising so much money then was something people thought was just plain wrong. EOS is not a scam, nor is it a shady project with ill intentions. It is a different consensus mechanism than what ETH uses. So there is the argument of whether it really is a decentralized platform since it uses the DPOS model. In ETH's current state there is a centralization of power with mining pools so you can make arguments both ways. EOS is not some bitconnect ponzi run off with the funds as some people on here like to make it out to be. I it just a different way of doing things.

The thing is, people still think there will be a one-for-all use case cryptocurrency, where in reality there will likely be currencies and chains for different use cases, like real estate vs micro-payments for ex. 

You likely wont care about speed and &lt;$1 transaction fees when buying real estate, but rather you will want to be secured by a smart contract that is signed by the immutable identity of the previous owner, along with other protections which the blockchain can provide without charging you crazy percentages or commission fees. 

Micro-transactions however, like daily purchases online (and maybe instore) should definitely be instant, free/cheap, and without the need for a bank. Also, keep in mind that products and its parts could likely end up being logged on the blockchain which could verify its existance, origin, etc. so if you were worried about being scammed (just like you are now when buying online and you check the reviews)  you can go through the smart contract and trace back the origin and verify legitimacy prior to purchase, along with reviews. 

A lot of this is far from reality but if you're claiming banks are a better protection for the consumer than the smart economy blockchains, which are trying to solve exactly that problem btw, then you're really not looking much further than one or two years down the road

Will regulation evolve? Yes. Definitely. But currently lawmakers are struggling to classify cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrencies will definitely fall under the definition of a security as the definition is very broad. This attitude was apparent in the recent discussion by the US SEC and other important figures. 

However, for taxation purposes; crypto is currently treated as property, and other than that there is no regulation except for ICOs a little bit. It is definitely not okay for people to be launching scam ICOs under our regulators. This is as far as the current regulation has gone at the moment. But this will change.

"@ 51% - I think I know what you are referring to, but you should just call out the argument directly (and as I wrote, you shouldn't even take anything written online as pseudo-advice... you should take my words as nothing more than just an opinion).

Let me clarify. There are two 51% categories that I see. Weak-form, which is what I would call the Mt. Gox / currency wallet / money management event, where someone who handles currency owned by others could manipulate them because they are a central platform, and strong-form, which is someone literally buying 51% of a crypto to manipulate it.

Weak-form never struck me as a concern because a community is far too aware and self-policing to let that happen. People will act in their own interest to ensure that they do not relinquish enough power to a third party that they could compromise the integrity of their investments by proxy.

Strong-form is the only credible threat to a crypto, but as I explained above the economics of it doesn't make sense.

Weak-form could be done with a few million USD if you were able to get everyone on your platform. Strong-form requires you to actually put up billions of dollars. However, weak-form will naturally be self-policed away, while strong-form there is nothing a community can do to actively block an attack. However, the cost of a strong-form attack is far too high and the risk of instantly losing billions on your investment is far too great.

Thusly any possible form of 51% attack seems very unlikely to be the reason cryptos (or any specific crypto of a notable size) would fail. The challenges for cryptos lie in positive features lining up, not a single disaster negative hole in the concept.",1525318539

"&gt;You cannot equate an investment in both to be the same.    

The goals of an investment, whether it is cash, gold, cryptocurrency, stock, are usually similar. All I am saying is that if I apply the same model of what an investement is worth to both eos and spacex, eos comes out on top for me. Getting caught up in details of profit, revenue etc doesn't matter much but I am more interested in ROI.    

&gt;You don't have the slightest clue which one they are when they are pre-revenue.    

Part of every valuation is a prediction on the future price of that asset - if you put your money into a swiss bank account, you would expect it would be reasonably stable and don't mind that that bank will run a reserve with your money. If you put your money in a Venezuelan bank, you should expect that the goverenment will just steal it from you, hence bank runs. This is the reason why some stocks who have revenue are priced at the same rate as stocks that have no revenue - people believe that the future revenue will be such that it will justify the price. I believe this is the case with eos, but further, I found the fact that op compared to spacex ironic because both are 'pre-profit' (I know profit not the right term for eos).     

&gt;I mean hell, how great an idea was the dollar shave club?    

Completely agree.    

&gt;You cannot compare that to a fucking functional business.    

Yes you can - see above, there will be a certain percentage of pre-profit businesses whose profit eventually exceeds tried and true proven business models. There will also be certain proven models that fail with the passage of time. Its all about risk/reward my friend. In crypto it is a speculation of how many users a platform will have in the future to drive growth in token price, what the use for those tokens are, and other factors like airdrops. When eos takes off, dapps will be hungry for more eos tokens, which will drive deflation of token, which will reward bps more, who will invest in more hardware for processing, which will increase the value of tokens, which will reward dapp developers, who will then reinvest in more dapps. As you can see - eos(if it takes off) is going to be a perfect storm and have a positive feedback loop on the price of a token.

"I'm going to try to keep this as concise as possible.

First, think about your government fiat, like USD, not inherently valuable right? Just a cotton paper composite with a fancy picture. Isn't ""really"" good for anything except that everyone agrees it's useful.

The problem is, there are people in charge of deciding how much gets printed, so today your $1 can buy a burger at a local fast food joint, but literally it is possible that 6 months from now $100 might not get you a burger if the authorities print enough extras of this cotton paper composite. Sure, unlikely, but it has happened all over the world more times than could be counted.

The solution is a system where no one is allowed to print more. There are technical details on why that get pretty hairy pretty fast, but when you own a bitcoin, you can be damn sure that you own a percentage of the pool of total bitcoin and there will NEVER be more added to the pool of total bitcoin.

The next most important concept is that it actually belongs to you. You might think you have $100,000 in the bank, but there could come a day when you go to the bank and say, ""may I please withdrawal my $100k?"" undoubtedly in US they would simply say ""no"", until you proved exactly what you were doing with it. This means YOU DO NOT OWN YOUR MONEY. The bank owns it, and they can dictate when and how much you have access to.

If you are so fortunate to live in the US, then you haven't really realized the pain this can cause. But there may come a time.... With Bitcoin, you ACTUALLY own your bitcoin. You and you alone. Think of it as a ""password"" (your private keys that you need to defend with your life, have backed up securely, etc). This allows you and ONLY you to spend any and ALL of your bitcoin when YOU decide to without asking for permission. This is a basic freedom that US citizens are primarily the only people that enjoy, and even they don't enjoy it fully with fiat. But with bitcoin they can, and so can everyone else. It IS power to the people.",1525317973

"While everything purchased from Blue Frontiers will be in varyon, private businesses on the seastead can use whichever currency they like. I assume bitcoin will thrive there.

The reason why Blue Frontiers had to go the currency route is because of the international nature of the project and with the amount of laws in the various countries about securities and ICOs, raising money through a security was next to impossible at this point in time. Especially in the US. Using varyon for all payments you are roughly getting a piece of the company by owning varyon without needing to go through the process of securities laws.

"Well, most people understand that there is some scaling headroom because the ""Raspberry Pi"" is used as a kind of reference hardware configuration for BTC.

Using an average PC as a reference hardware configuration instead of the Raspberry Pi, we can have roughly one order of magnitude  increase for transactions capacity, that's where BCH is right now (or will be after increasing the block size limit to 32MB).

But the problem is that merely an order of magnitude transactions capacity increase is not good enough for a really large scale adoption. Increasing the block size limit even more is going to make running full nodes prohibitively expensive because that's not something than an average Joe can afford. And this is where we have a fundamental disagreement between BTC and BCH. BCH supporters are convinced that it's alright if only rich corporations can afford running full nodes. This is similar to saying that auditing traditional banks is entirely pointless because auditors are not doing actual money transactions. Today anyone with a Raspberry Pi technically can (but does not have to) audit the BTC network and be sure that the rules are enforced. But tomorrow nobody even with a high end PC will be able to audit the BCH network and this is something that many people don't like about it.",1525317637

So the cost of nearly full buyout of the asset class is max $3.0T Blackrock manages over $6.3T, so a single firm could literally buy out the entire asset class at even the most exhorbitant price and it wouldn't even take up half their AUM.

Totally true but really it doesn't need to replace cash and I don't think the US government would allow it simply because of the way currency and the economy is manipulated. However Bitcoin could replace pretty much everything else. PayPal Visa all of that. All of those companies now become obsolete technology. It seems to me that it would be very easy to have a BTC USD pair that is completely interchangeable with one another through all of the modern exchanges we are likely to see. You could probably even get to the point of using Bitcoin or other contract coins on vendors like eBay. I mention eBay because people or buyers are going to want some kind of reassurance they aren't getting ripped off so all of that again can be worked into the picture.

Goldman Sachs and other large financial firms were essentially the largest catalyst leading up to the 2008 recession. We should not be allowing these actors to influence the crypto markets; especially given the fact that one of the main reasons Bitcoin was created was to help the average retail investor avoid the heavily-manipulated traditional markets.

I want to see crypto help the average joe pay off their student loan debts, car insurance, mortgages, and of course LAMBOs_durrrr.gif.

I don’t want to see institutions making money off of retail investors. If the average retail investor starts taking progressively heavier and heavier losses due to investor exhaustion as a result of high institutional market manipulation, then crypto will slowly bleed off all of the organic growth that it has spent years accumulating.

This is (theoretically) how crypto could slowly be strangled to death by institutional capital. And just like that, the financial “revolution” is over and income inequality continues to widen in the world.

Unless technology advances faster. I agree that side or off chain transactions need to be worked on, but saying that increasing the blocks from 1MB to 8, or even 32 will centralize Bitcoin when storage is by far the cheapest part of a node is absurd.

&gt;This increases centralization by making it essentially impossible for the average user to run a node. 

The average user already can't run a node, nodes require high computational power, I have a powerful PC, able to mine Ethereum at a minimal profit and I can't run a BTC node. Because if you think that any non-mining node makes any difference to the network you're just fooling yourself.

Now in?

some speak from Rana Yared

“I would not describe myself as a true believer who wakes up thinking Bitcoin will take over the world,” Ms. Yared said. “For almost every person involved, there has been personal skepticism brought to the table.”

Ms. Yared said Goldman had concluded that Bitcoin is not a fraud and does not have the characteristics of a currency. But a number of clients wanted to hold it as a valuable commodity, similar to gold, given the limited quantity of Bitcoin that can ever be “mined” in a complex, virtual system.

“It resonates with us when a client says, ‘I want to hold Bitcoin or Bitcoin futures because I think it is an alternate store of value,’” she said.

Since the beginning of the year, the price of Bitcoin has plunged — and recovered significantly — as traders have faced uncertainty about how regulators will deal with virtual currencies.

“It is not a new risk that we don’t understand,” Ms. Yared said. “It is just a heightened risk that we need to be extra aware of here.”

Mr. Schmidt said Goldman’s sophistication was a big part of the reason he was open to the job, despite many other opportunities in the virtual currency world.

“In terms of having a trusted institutional player, it has been something I have been looking for in my own crypto trading — but it didn’t exist,” he said.

"1) the leader is roger ver, famous for being on par with Trump for truthfulness.  To this day, he still carries on with his illogical argument that bcash is the ""real bitcoin"" which does nothing but piss everyone off constantly and hard not only themselves but the entire cryptosystem.  This pisses so many people off that there is a dedicated group that is getting ready to sue Roger if he doesn't quit his bullshit. http://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-lawsuit-bitcoin-com-ceo-roger-ver/

2) started out as a ""big block"" vs ""small block"" debate.  big blockers don't care or don't believe that having a block chain which could exceed multiple TB of disk space per year is a problem and support scaling up this way without regard to efficiency.  Small blockers think that we should be going for efficiency gains before raising the block size. Bcash is a bigblock strategy which most small blockers think is a bad strategy.

3) there are claims that the main reason bitcoin cash didn't want to use segwit is because it breaks the unfair mining shortcuts that the chinese mining cartels use to make their mining cheaper to do then it should be because they found some shortcut in the mining which is fixed with the introduction of segwit.  This argument has largely been silenced since the patent that allowed the unfair mining has now been put out into the open so anyone can use it by another company who also had a patent on the same thing.

4) when bcash first came out, its mining algo was designed (either on purpose or just badly) to cause massive disruption in the block creation times of bitcoin by screwing with the minining difficulty on the bcash chain which went on for months before they finally changed it.  Most people who supported bitcoin saw this as a deliberate attack and further soured the relationship. ",1525312361

"I commented in a post to this article earlier, but...

tldr: To moon, what we need is more direct investment in the underlier and less in derivative instruments.

First things first, this is great news. All around positive for the progress and adoption of both physical and derivative instruments related to crypto.

And with that said, yes, we went live on futures on the CME and CBOE. Sweet. And yes, now GS is going to be offering products derived on the price of Bitcoin. The fact is this, both are derivatives built on the “price” of Bitcoin and do little to directly drive the price of any crypto asset up or down (half true as in given current state open interest is more easily manipulated with the relatively low volume).

For shit to hit the moon, what we need is both Institutional and Wealth businesses directly investing in the underlier. What’s an underlier? Bitcoin, ETH, ELA and NEO are all underliers (obvious shills)...the underlier is the actual coin. Futures and all these derivatives are not “actual” investments creating volume. It’s like the Big Short, a bet, on top of a bet, on top a bet... Not a perfect metaphor, but conceptually close.

You know what would be news, in my mind? An exchange traded fund (ETF) or Mutual Fund. That’s when we’re going to see shit hit the fan...market cap hitting the multi trillions.

Not only do they have the technology and deep pockets but also know how to play this game.   
Just because banking is ""regulated"" does not mean they don't all play hard and dirty against each other.   
Some of the things they have done are, to DDOS attacks to their competitors trading network so they can have an advantage with HFTs. Moved entire office right next to the exchange to have /ms advantage over others.   
Disrupted satellite and laser network signals.    
Colluded in groups to affect one single entity... the lists go on.    
Since crypto is unregulated they will dominate and the average person will lose big time.    
All of which will force governments to knee jerk react and push for very strict tough regulations, which will essentially make cryptos redundant.   

the only people to blame are those who continue to treat cryptos as assets and blindly yell HODL!",1525311442

"Roger, There is one simple argument that is impossible to refute.  

https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf - 1st paragraph abstract. 1st fucking thing out of the white paper besides the title, Defines the valid chain as: ""longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened"".  ""Work"" in this context is defined as: ""proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power."" AKA most hashing power.  This is also the commonly accepted meaning as well so this cant even be argued that its not the common use of the meaning because it is.

Therefore for ""bcash"" to be ""bitcoin"" you would need to have the most work done since the first block to have a valid claim on it.  Since its been over 6 months and that never happened, I would say any claim that you might have been able to make in the past right after the fork shouldn't be carried on any longer.  Its not approperate since your bcash chain didn't overtake bitcoin has has 0 chance of ever happening in terms of mining power.  Had bcash become more valuable then bitcoin, the miners would have flipped to that chain and you would be right.  But that didn't happen and its never going to happen no matter how many people you try and convince.  The longer you carry this campaign at this point, the more harm you do to your selves and the community as a whole.  Keep poking the hornets nest and that group of 1000+ people who is getting donations together to sue you will get a lot bigger and you will get sued.  Count on that.  I have not donated yet but I and many others will if you don't cut this shit out and soon.  Best thing you can do right now is declare victory and say that your no longer going to cause confusion with bitcoin and that you can win on your own merits.  That will end this entire debate.    

I quote from the whitepaper: 

""The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone."" -- Satoshi ",1525310848

A. I'm a retired 22 year old who happens to have already gained the title of crypto millionaire so

B. I don't care what coin gets pumped up to top 10 because it doesn't effect me very much. most of my portfolio is in XRP and XLM and these coins don't really pose a threat to that niche.

I think tron is overvalued because I see it as something that's just had the shit marketed out of it without bringing anything different to the table. the idea of the name tron  Disney movie. they named it tron because they're attempting to make it the currency for digital assets, which is a role that I could literally see 10 other cryptos filling and I don't see any compelling reasons why someone would use tron for its said use case over x, y, or z.


yes the whitepaper plagiarism thing bothers me and especially seeing trons continued price movement, it seems fishy to me. its like when verge had miners minting coins by exploiting the timestamps and then verge saw positive price action and everyone was like ""whaaaaaat"".

yes because the Bitcoin network is a serial ringnet where all the traffic has to pass thru every node and this ensures 100% propagation dependence of every RaspiNode.

"While it's a pragmatic approach in the short to mid term, it's unlikely to be the long term plan.

A bunch of work is being done on better scalability improvements, and that work can be done painlessly since there is no made-up imperative to keep the block size artificially low until they're ready.

However, and most notably, since there isn't a centralized dev team controlling the technical path with an iron fist, it's certainly harder to predict where BCH will end up.

With that said, known works that improves scalability and could end up in BCH include [Graphene Blocks](/r/btc/comments/7b1nrr/graphene_is_a_new_bitcoin_block_propagation/)  and [Bitcoin-NG](http://hackingdistributed.com/2015/10/14/bitcoin-ng/).

More generally, you would probably fit in here just fine. Not everybody agrees with how best to scale BCH in the long run, and that's not just okay, it's desirable. There's no official party line you're expected to parrot or risk getting censored.  
I'm sure there are folks here that think that just naively raising the blocksize forever is fine, and those people don't understand what a O(n^(2)) notation mean. But that's not the whole story by a long shot.",1525310203
"This. 

Obligatory I work at an investment bank in NY and cover futures. 

And tldr: To moon, what we need is more direct investment in the underlier and less in derivative instruments. 

First things first, this is great news. All around positive for the progress and adoption of both physical and derivative instruments related to crypto. 

And with that said, yes, we went live on futures on the CME and CBOE. Sweet. And yes, now GS is going to be offering products derived on the price of Bitcoin. The fact is this, both are derivatives built on the “price” of Bitcoin and do little to directly drive the price of any crypto asset up or down (half true as in given current state open interest is more easily manipulated with the relatively low volume). 

For shit to hit the moon, what we need is both Institutional and Wealth businesses directly investing in the underlier. What’s an underlier? Bitcoin, ETH, ELA and NEO are all underliers (obvious shills)...the underlier is the actual coin. Futures and all these derivatives are not “actual” investments creating volume. It’s like the Big Short, a bet, on top of a bet, on top a bet... Not a perfect metaphor, but conceptually close.

"You are correct.  BCH would have fee problems if it had more users and usage than it can handle.  That has never been disputed - and the model for that how that happens has been observed on BTC.

When people start bidding for blockspace fees rise.  When there is plenty of blockspace then there is no bidding hence the fees will be low.  True, if miners got together and decided to only accept 100 s/byte txs, then yes fees could rise that way as well - but we have not seen this.

What we *have* seen is low fee txs being dropped from the BTC mempool when the backlog was 300MB back in december.

As far as ""fees will be high when the coin price is high"" - well, lets see if its possible to pay $0.01 for a 300-byte tx when BCH is $100K.

Answer: set your fee to 1 sat/30 bytes - problem solved...you are back to $0.01.  So price of coin being high does not necessarily affect the fee because you can adjust the fee to whatever you want.  

Its up to the miners to decide if that fee is big enough or not - and we have not seen miners dropping $0.01 transactions (some do drop zero-fee - cant blame them for that).

&gt; Most institutional investors will not buy Bitcoin at rock bottom but at a more convincing bottom than $5900 (once the $6000 BTC resistance is broken, a new hell will break loose and the whales will be directing that crash course).

Institutional investors are there to make money. 2K, 6K, 10K... it doesn't matter. For those who have access to billions, those prices are peanuts.

But there's one thing institutional investors like, and it's assurances. They like to make sure they will get their profit, one way or another. This is where Bitcoin still could fail.

I agree with you in the sense that Whalers will control the next crash, but in my opinion, the whalers are the institutional investors. In my opinion, they are already in the market, making money and moving their pieces into key places of this massive crypto-game. 

Why am I certain of this? Ask yourself. If institutional investors likes assurances, wouldn't they want to have control of the game? They will do what they have been doing in every market. Controlling it. 

Bitcoin is a scarce currency right? Control a large piece of the currency, and you will control the direction of the market. 

HODLER's don't control shit. They are out of the market. They have no influence on the bitcoin market value. Yes, some of them will probably get rich, but not that many.

&gt; From that point on, Bitcoin will soar to new highs $60k/BTC and a crypto market in the trillions. 

Billions would need to enter the market for that and institutional investors are not there to inject value. They are there to profit. To take value out of the market.

"Fiat is used in every day transactions and business deals. This means that at all the stages of production, a price in dollars was negotiated, meaning that future prices have to be stable. The store owner has to know that the good costs 1 dollar from their seller, and that people are willing to pay 5 dollars for it. For this to work, there has to be a concept of what a dollar is worth. This is done by analyzing the past, and inferring future prices from them. It is this price discovery that leads to price stability. As long as prices dont change that much, the process works, and prices all move in concert.

People who accept cryptocurrency are pricing it in dollars, and then converting it to bitcoin. The dollar amounts are what matters to them, and the bitcoin is mostly liquidated immediately. This means that the concept of how much a bitcoin is worth is irrelevant. Price discovery only occurs when the currency is used in all parts of the business to calculate profit and loss. So, because no price discovery is occurring, the actual price is instead determined on a pseudo stock market, and a small one at that. A million dollars will not move the Dow Jones industrial average, but can move the price of bitcoin mountains. So, given that the Dow Jones is unstable, the bitcoin price is even more unstable.

If he current price of bitcoin reflects anything, it reflects the speculated future price multiplied by the probability of achieving that price. The future price is speculated to be in the millions, and the probability changes in people's heads by orders of magnitude, which is easy because the probability as expressed by the market is around a percentage point. If somebody corrects me about the probability of success or future value, then we are part of the reason the price is so unstable.",1525308337

* The majority of the features of bitcoin are not valuable to the average consumer. Trustlessness is not valuable to most people. Even if it were, it is an empty promise. Trust-based relationships permeate the bitcoin ecosphere (mining pools, currency exchanges, etc.). It makes the trustlessness inherent in blockchain moot.

seems obvious to me.  there's no question it leads to lower fees and no delays.  merchants and users resonate with that.  here's one example just from today:  https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8ghoyp/as_a_startup_focused_on_cryptocurrency_adoption/

read carefully his message.  it's a very practical logical approach that is facilitated by BCH's bigger blocks.

well, it could be just the case with BCH's low fees and no delays.

&gt;runs the risk of increasing operating costs for miner making it less profitable which could lead to less nodes, more centralization. 

adding additional tx's to a block is marginally inexpensive.  and why not if it facilitates worldwide adoption.  the miners supporting BCH are merely following the concepts in the WP; as they should since that is the strategy that has led to where we are today.  a super high price, excitement and innovation we haven't ever seen before in the financial space and ppl talking about it all over the place.  i keep being astounded at how i'm overhearing all these convos about Bitcoin in coffee shops etc.  the space is growing and BCH is taking the lead, no doubt about it.  i don't ever see any new companies announcing over in r/bitcoin anymore compared to r/btc.",1525306717

"I am reading the book ""Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind""
by Yuval Noah Harari that is giving several positive insights about Bitcoin and money in general. I definitely recommend.

Two interesting parts of the book about this money and what it really represent:

""Money *is not coins and banknotes*. Money is anything that people are willing to use in order to represent systematically the value of other things for the purpose of exchanging goods and services. Money enables people to compare quickly and easily the value of different commodities (such as apples, shoes and divorces), to easily exchange one thing for another, and to store wealth conveniently.""

""Money is accordingly a system of mutual trust, and not just any system of mutual trust: *money is the most universal and most efficient system of mutual trust ever devised.*""

The point is, the society is slowly but surely distrusting the bank system and the fact they misused the trust embedded on money. Bitcoin solves exactly this problem, relying trust on math.
The only missing point around Bitcoin is mass acknowledgment and adoption. Eventually, it will be achieved and it will be a point of no return. ",1525305774

herp derp.  lol, wut?  it has to do with everything.  in fact, we're starting to see evidence of this phenomenon as we speak on BCH.  we've seen Memo, Blockpress, Cointext, Yours, etc springing up b/c of the promise onchain scaling bringing in new users.  all b/c of bigger blocks.  i'll bet all of those are running their own full nodes to verify payments. it's the prudent thing to do, not to mention they have a fiduciary responsibility to do so if they are accepting customer money.

Obviously the people that own EOS on average do not think it's overvalued, that's all that matters and that sets the price.

I think Etheruem and Bitcoin is overvalued, but so what right? Who cares what I think when I have no basis for associating a more realistic value to them.

Is EOS overvalued at $20 but not a $10? Overvalued at $10 but not at $1. How so?

In crypto right now there's no fundamental basis for any such valuation other than the market, which assuming it is not being manipulated (which based on EOS trading volumes its not) is the exact and only determining factor for its valuation.

Ergo: EOS is not overvalued because it has a market price. ",1525303229

"here are two back to back quotes from almost exactly 2 years about the shady Larimer Gang.

https://bitcointalk.to/index.php?topic=1466593.msg%msg_id%

""Let's not forget how this is the 3rd (or 4th) thread for this instamined/premined shitcoin which has launched with lies in the OP (calling no premine/instamine) and lack of instructions and wallets so 99% of the people can't mine a coin that is meant for the people (?). They even relaunched once after their miners crashed claiming a bug.

Huge additional red flags that the developers still go on with opening new topics, specially after the 4 week long (extreme short pow) is over now (only 1 out of 21 blocks is a pow block) and they mined 80-90% of the supply, which stakes for them.

Noobs please be aware that if you try and buy this coin on exchanges you will keep getting dumped on (mostly according to the funding needs of the developers since they control most of the supply). If you are really interested, play their game and get it for free on their website, but supporting this is like supporting XPY.

""The way social media is meant to be... decentralized"" yeah, powered by a currency that has been almost exclusively mined by a central authority, the developers in a short period with shady tools to obtain most power. Funny.""

""Yeah, that's the first thing I look for too in a Larimer thread.  ""Is it moderated?""  I guess junior isn't as savvy as Pop Larimer when it comes to pulling the wool over peoples' eyes.

I love how the Larimer Gang launched their new scam.  It's hilarious.  First they attempted to dominate the mining and then when they didn't due to ""technical difficulties"", they invalidated all the previous miners' rewards and relaunched it so they could have a second try at it and they succeeded that time.  What type of a messed up joke is that?  To those of you who were around when the Larimer Gang first entered the crypto scene with Protoshares, you'll remember the Larimers did a similar trick then too.  I mined Protoshares from the first few blocks on the chain.  There were numerous complaints on the PTS/BTS forum about people having connection issues and having their miners getting booted off the network.  All the while, the Larimer Gang was happily mining away and denying that there were any issues.  To this day Stan Larimer (aka Daddy Larimer, aka The Ringleader) claims this isn't true, but anyone around back then knows it to be fact that the Larimer Gang and their Chinese Communist associates were mining the heck out of PTS.

Now, they have this Steem garbage, which is a blatant ripoff of Synereo.  The Larimers don't have an original idea in their body and can only poorly mimic others' creative concepts to hopefully scam a few suckers into giving them their money.  Just like they ripped off NXT's PoS algo and poorly implemented it as DPoS in Bitshares, they are now doing the exact same thing with Synereo.  Heck, they even chose a name that is very similar to Synereo, ""Steem"".  I'm sure they're hoping that people get confused, because they both start with a ""S"" and purchase their poorly implemented scam.""

EOS is just a clone of STEEM which is a clone of BITSHARES which is itself a ripoff of some other coins. They are all dPOS garbage. This is hype and if you buy at these prices and hold past a certain point you are absolutely guaranteed to get dumped on. 

Go for some coins that will actual have some degree of decentralization and censorship resistance, that don't have 5% annual inflation. 

They advertise EOS as ""free"" (free to send tx) but really this isn't true. The inflation puts the transaction cost on EVERYONE holding EOS whether you transact or not. This is clearly inferior to a system like Ethereum where you pay for what you use. EOS is basically just a cash cow for block producers. A way for these block rewards to milk all of the value out of the system over time; to hover up all the money that has been invested.

"&gt; You could also buy channel headroom if you're running out of capacity: rather than make new channels you can buy existing ones - and you can pay for that with LN itself, so it would be instant. 

You can already do that. Say you have two channels, one where you own the entire balance and one where your peer does. Rather than two asymmetrical channels you'd rather have two symmetrical channels. So you find a route between your two channels and make a payment from one to the other, rebalancing both.

There's also something called splicing or reanchoring that will allow you to add or subtract balance to a channel with a single on-chain transaction, without closing it.

I think what you want is not really feasible. In order to securely transfer control over a channel, just as the underlying bitcoin itself, it must be done on-chain. Off-chain channel transfer amounts to private key sharing and is not secure.",1525302026

"The historical context is that the Feds shut down eGold and Paypal had to pivot away from being more of a digital currency toward just being a payment processor for cc's / bank accounts. Bitcoin not having a central authority makes it difficult to shut down and even difficult to figure out who to lean on to shut it down (unless you live in Peter Todd's rich world of fantasy imagination). Somewhere along the line a faction of post-$32 bubble developers perverted this idea into an excuse not to increase transactional capacity, on the basis of a unfalsifiable, non-concrete, highly ideological set of quasi-religious beliefs about centralization that they developed and propagated stroking each other off on IRC.",1525301932

"&gt;Don't think that small programming groups are necessarily a hindrance. We've a saying in programming circles ""what one programmer can do in a month, two can do in two months"" ;)

How about ""it took 9 years for the collective programming genius of the bitcoin community to come up with a 2nd layer beta, which only works as a very complicated and unnecessary P2P gift card system for less than 2000 people"".

Several generations of new coins have been created in that time that all work better than Lightning does and handle more transactions.

Lightning isn't about overcoming any technical limitations or solving any problem, its an article of faith. It's been hyped as a panacea since its inception and used as an excuse and a refuge from tackling the need for protocol changes. Lightning is going to save bitcoin by the radical innovation of amortizing transactions costs over several transactions which is already possible a dozen different ways but lets not think about why merchants don't just use them too hard. With the added bonus of extremely unreliable mesh net routing constrained by peoples finances.

&gt;This setback actually development and adoption a long way because it meant computer scientists who would otherwise be coding, spent an inordinate amount of time writing essays and convening conference discussions.

Segwit is still significantly below 50% adoption, and nowhere near the 95% adoption threshold. If Segwit is vital for Lightning and Lightning is vital for Bitcoin it raises odd questions about why neither are seeing more use, given that apparently millions of people are using Bitcoin and in desperate need of the solutions being worked on.",1525301616

"Not sure what you mean by ""share"".  If your talking about like a block reward, like you get for mining bitcoin, then no there is no reward like that in iota since there are no ""miners"" because the proof of work is done during the transaction of iota. 

People are currently running full nodes to help support the network and community out of good faith, since there is no reward in running a full node. But there is CarrIOTA that has a donation pool that gets divided amongst people running full nodes, but again those are donations from people, not rewards built into iotas architecture. 

However, there are some upcoming projects such as cogniota (which I really don't know much about) that I believe will be rewarding people in iota for allowing them to let other people use part of their comps computational power for data storage or machine learning or something like that",1525301440

"Let me ask you, do you think Microsoft talked this way about Windows in the late 90's - 2000's? I'm sure they also had absolute confidence nobody would never overtake or compete with them because they did everything better too. Then the iPhone arrived. Then AWS arrived. Microsoft were best positioned in the tech industry to capitalize, so why didn't they?

Every altcoin will never do what Bitcoin does out of the gate. But that doesn't mean the project never has no hope to compete or they or the people who support it are stupid or ignorant of monetary economics. It just means they're not Bitcoin.",1525301404

something i don't get about this though is FIAT does not fluctuate in price like bitcoin currently does?  ,1525301307
"I'll also add... If transaction fees are a crypto-leading .1% (not definitive) then on a volume of $10 million each node would generate, not accounting for appreciation of the crypto assets roughly $1000 per year. At $100 million, $10,000, and at $1 billion $100,000.

Considering a daily known volume of roughly 35 billion at an overall crypto marketcap of $440 billion.... and applying, not very accurately given no actual like-kind info, the equity history of 40% of overall trades being done on dark pools, dark pools are doing roughly $20 billion in daily volume today. 

It is not a stretch imo to suggest that Republic can capture a solid percentage of the dark pool market and as the overall marketcap grows so do payouts. 

Its all hypothetical of course, so in the meantime I am just enjoying looking forward to the testnet and mainnet.",1525301282
I don't get why that's a nightmare though. No different that trading stocks which people do all the time. Print out your transaction report and do it yourself or use something like bitcoin tax. ,1525301163

"Very speculative because it won’t be trading in actual bitcoins any time soon - needs regulator approval as it is stated in the article. 

Tittle sounds like they’ll start trading bitcoins while they’ll actually just open up a big gambling table for bitcoin futures, doing a cash settlement and no one ever really touching bitcoins in those deals. Am I wrong?",1525301154

Crypto God:  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯,1525301133
"The irony is strong with this one:
&gt;The devs of the client strictly censor all forums and channels titled ""bitcoin""

Are you saying that the bitcoin developers control rbtc, where this discussion is taking place, or bitcoin.com, the source of the image?

While your obvious strawman is just that, and a poor executed one, it is also irrelevant to the point of this thread and the discussion here, as well as my question.

Nevertheless, I'll entertain the rest of the readers and commenters.

Please, help add to the discussion instead of gaslighting it.
As the OP title says, ""name calling doesn't make the reality go away""

I'm all for comparing the merits of different bitcoin client implementations, like btcd, libbitcoin or core, aka the Satoshi client, and I'm also all for comparing the merits of different blockchains, or coins if you will, like DOGE, LTC, ETH, BCH and of course BTC

But those are different topics, go ahead and start a thread on them and I'll follow with some constructive ideas. Meanwhile, ITT the OP is presenting an image from his commercial website, where he sells *both* those coins, mostly to unsuspected newcomers.

This false representation by the seller, is misleading, intentional, almost borders on malicious. It might surely look like a joke to you, as much as it looks to me, because you know what a blockchain is and what a transaction hash shows, and how to safely sweep a paper wallet. But Vers' average customer doesn't.

That image is the price charts of two distinct blockchains, and he is using the name of one of many different software implementations like the ones I mentioned above [plus many more](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Clients), capable of following the same set of rules on the Bitcoin network, as the name of one of the coins, while he uses the name of a blockchain for the second coin, on top of which many different client implementations like BitcoinABC, BitcoinUnlimited or Parity coexist happily by following the rules of the BCH network. 

The graph should read Bitcoin/BitcoinCash because in OP's image  Bitcoin has an ATH price of $19,346.6, BitcoinCash has an ATH price of 3,715.9, while, and this little piece of intel is missing from all over his commercial site,  [BitcoinCore can be downloaded for free!!!111!!](https://bitcoin.org/en/download)

For free, as in free speech, you know?",1525301127
"1. Possibly a mix of both but certainly leaning heavily towards the latter.
2. This is in the same category with credit card returns. But yes, point taken. The issue with the settlement times is partly due to the amount of controls and risk measures required on a federal level for the banking system. Sure, crypto/BTC can possibly circumvent this system, but you'd be wrong if you think large businesses/enterprises are actually willing to forego that type of safety. And let's not pretend that a majority of transactions are ""business-sized"". When a $4 coffee has the chance to become a $64 coffee due to the means of payment, your system blows. 
3. It's not a matter of banker or not banker... intrinsic value as used in the media is a financial term, subject to interpretation on different methods of valuation. It is especially significant to investors who believe that a certain asset is not appropriately valued, and let's be real, that's 99% of this subreddit so intrinsic value is still extremely meaningful here. Warren Buffett doesn't ""end"" arguments with the argument of intrinsic value, but the average proponents of cryptocurrency certainly don't have any meaningful expertise in the realm of valuing things (or anything in general), which is why the conversation usually stops there. The ""digital gold"" argument is a classic that people can and do use. In your case, you have assigned some type of value to transaction speed, and that's fine. However, whatever strength your argument had is negated by the following drivel that you shat out of your keyboard. 
4. I don't care if you've had 100+ years of experience being Vitalik Buterin. Type something that stupid and you are getting flamed by anyone who isn't a typical cryptotard (Disclaimer: I am in full support of blockchain/crypto but our community is dogshit, inclusive of this post). ",1525301114

"&gt; Sure, currently... What about in the future. it's far easier to determine a Bitcoin was used for an illegal transaction four years ago after finding out a user's address that performed an illegal transaction and finding every single place that Bitcoin went than it is to know which bills were used in an illegal transaction from four years ago.

And? I seriously doubt a merchant is going to reject a bitcoin because it was used to buy drugs four years ago  - would a merchant reject cash because it has a trace about of cocaine on it? If so, they'd have to reject the overwhelming majority of cash.

&gt; Because you can misplace your record of your private key, or just remember it, but then if something happens to you it's gone. Far easier to misplace a ledger with $100m of Bitcoin on it than 4,000 lbs of gold 

Very true when dealing with large amounts, but what about smaller amounts?

I have few KCS but it seems to stagnate, I also believe Kucoin is also owned by the same owners of Binance, so doubt KCS will have room to grow anymore, could be wrong though.

As for coins, I believe 99% of them are *shitcoin* (including few of the top 30 at CMC), only good for volatility short term trading, but for hodl (which is my main interest), more solid coins that currently have a use is a better bet, the crypto market still has room to grow and prosper.

Too many coins focus on being really good in only one small area which will hurt them as a business is not going to want to have to use multiple cryptos for different tasks.

"&gt; Why would you want to buy an active channel rather than open your own?

Because I wouldn't need a main chain transaction.  It's not just a case of saving the fees - it could open up a whole frontier of economic activity.  Eg you could sell something directly for a channel balance.  People could go straight in to LN without having to go via bitcoin.  You could also buy channel headroom if you're running out of capacity:  rather than make new channels you can buy existing ones - and you can do that with LN itself, so it would be instant.  So the network could rebalance itself second by second.

I don't know, maybe this is nonsense or pointless.

Sure, currently... What about in the future. it's far easier to determine a Bitcoin was used for an illegal transaction four years ago after finding out a user's address that performed an illegal transaction and finding every single place that Bitcoin went than it is to know which bills were used in an illegal transaction from four years ago.

&gt;Non-consumable: Gold and Cash physically exist, meaning they can both be misplaced in the physical world with no way of retrieving it. Why isn't this counted against them, if a wrong address is counted against bitcoin?

Because you can misplace your record of your private key, or just remember it, but then if something happens to you it's gone. Far easier to misplace a ledger with $100m of Bitcoin on it than 4,000 lbs of gold

&gt;Predictable supply and value: I notice you counted gold's unpredictable supply against it (you don't really know how much gold there is in the world overall, we don't know when mining asteroids will be a thing, etc) but you didn't count bitcoins predictable supply towards it. Bitcoin has a VERY predictable supply, it is only value that is volatile.

Predictible supply doesn't mean much if the value is changing drastically. This point could easily change in the future if Bitcoin gains adoption and if the price stabalizes a but, but right now if I asked you how many McDonalds hamburgers you could buy in 10 years with $1000, $1000 of gold or $1000 of Bitcoin. The range you would give to be 90% confident is why I ranked these the way I did. If someone gave a range for Bitcoin that wasn't ""somewhere between 0 and 10 million burgers, I'd be surprised.

But it gets even worse for cryptos like Monero, you have to actually check each block in the blockchain as well. So the current Monero height is about 1.5 million, so you're asking for 15 million trillion years to crack a single XMR address when you own only 8 words.

Bitcoin needed the malleability fixes that came with Segwit to make lightning possible and, more importantly, it needed consensus to bring them about.  A lot was learnt along the way as to exactly how (and by whom) that consensus is arrived at.  This setback actually development and adoption a long way because it meant computer scientists who would otherwise be coding, spent an inordinate amount of time writing essays and convening conference discussions.

Don't think that small programming groups are necessarily a hindrance.  We've a saying in programming circles ""what one programmer can do in a month, two can do in two months"" ;)

As with all workgroups, it's nearly all to do with how well the group can work together as a team and how committed they all are to the same plan.

I don't disagree with you that betting on the house is a solid idea, I just wonder if it's something that's going to be wildly profitable as compared to &lt;Exhibit B&gt;, which is any other up and coming coin - Something like [Huobi Token](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/huobi-token/) or [KCS](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kucoin-shares/) - One of which is on the Rise, and another which has bottomed out and is at a better entry point.

All 3 are technically betting on the house, just BNB is betting on the biggest and the best house to succeed - It would be kind of like betting on Coinbase, if Coinbase had a token - Pretty much everyone is already invested in it, and its growth potential is more limited as a result. 

By virtue of being the biggest exchange, it also has the least room to grow, as opposed to the other smaller exchanges. Likewise, it has some of the least risk, since the bigger you are, generally the more stable you are. 

It might just be me, but I think BNB has had its rising and buy chances for a while now -  And if I was a new investor wanting to put money in, I would probably only get a few for trading fees and look for something with the potential for more volatility during a rise.

For instance, if you were looking to get in on a skyrocketing asset that likely hasn't hit the top yet, you could pick up on something like [Loom Network](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/loom-network/) or [Cortex](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cortex/) - Two newer coins that have been making moves and in the event of a rise could possibly double or triple with BTC moving $1000 or so.

I mean, the surprise announcement threw everyone off and that was in the remaining single hour(s) countdown.

I think that is it completely possible that Eterbase could achieve the same thing considering a huge aspect of the exchange is based around compliance. If you follow Cryptocurrency news AT ALL, you will see that todays top exchanges are actively running away from regulations apposed to confronting them head on. If Eterbase follows through with what they say they will do , they will likely be the first exchange in the space to pull this off. Another thing that makes me believe Eterbase will succeed is the uses of their token , ETX. From what i understand it is a membership token you can use to get perks with on your Eterbase Card which you can use the same way as a ""crypto debit card"".

so by definition those are all extrinsic factors.

The code can be exactly the same, it depends entirely on outside factors like how many people are using it, how many people are maintaining code, how many people are mining it etc.

that means if all those things go away, it becomes worthless, ergo it has no intrinsic value.

Gold still has uses no matter how many people are mining it, or trading it, or researching it. That's the kind of thing that is being referred to as ""intrinsic"" value (given that all value is subjective so 'instrinsic' refers only to a subset of subjective values, ones not dependent on extrinsic factors)

&gt;These are defined as ""intangible factors"" wich combined with tangible assets, such as he talks about create intrinsic value

I don't know what you're defining ""intrinsic"" to mean, it doesn't seem any different than any other form of value.

Fiat is valuable because millions of people are trading it and governments regulate it and banks facilitate its payments. Without all those things its worthless, that's why its not considered intrinsically valuable.

The way that segwit was implemented was coercive, and it never would have achieved support via hard fork.

Bitcoin is synonymous with cryptocurrency in the majority of the world's minds. If you pay attention to this sub, BTC is dead and will never have a chance. This is simply not true, the average Joe is going to buy BTC over some alt he has never heard mentioned once on the street.

I am not at all a fan of the direction BTC has gone personally, but it still makes up a good portion of my portfolio. This is partially due to it being what I had the most of for awhile, but also due to the fact that most institutional interest is headed towards BTC (I know other coins have institutional interest also before fanatics start screaming examples of ""their"" coin). It's just smart to have a decent chunk of your investment in BTC. I know many people here are very short term, and yes, it probably won't 10x in a few months but it's still good to have for a long term investment.

That being said, it's not the majority of my portfolio but I will always keep a portion of it in BTC. I'm far from a BTC maximalist (although I kind of used to be). This sub is such an echo chamber that it's easy to believe BTC is dying, but again, that is not true.

I agree on most parts, however even though XLM was given away for free in the beginning, today, people have to buy it, and it is a form of investment. There's a very limited group of people who use Crypto every day for purchases, and I would guess most of these use either BTC, ETH or XMR as they are more known and accepted by stores. 

&gt;you'd have to expect (2) interpretation of 1% inflation pool to be way more important than (4) where clearly xrp has a more centralized promotional apparatus

This is my thoughts as well. It all comes down to how it is interpreted. XLM holders (if any even) don't hold XLM to benefit from the inflation pool. 

The case for XRP is much more advanced, as most investors won't be using their XRP, and it is an investment. The profit does not come directly from a third party, but a third party (Ripple) inviting another third party (FIs) to start using a software utilizing XRP. This third party will then buy XRP for the pure purpose of transfer, not investment like everyday joe. Does this mean that there has to be a different rule set for FIs and Investors?

Bitcoin Cash has larger blocks that don't fill up and fees that don't increase so it can be used for those payments.

Also, it seems weird to use ETH as a comparison... ETH was $15 at one point, but it was also between $11-$15 **for  6 straight months**, allowing anyone to purchase it whenever they wanted to for that price point, so there was plenty of entry points around $15.

Of course, that was in a wildly different crypto culture so there's no real comparing this to Binance Coin - I think my point is that in general, you want to angle for better entry points to reduce the risk of handling hot coins at their highs.

If for some reason BNB went on some sort of historic run, there would be plenty of entry points to FOMO into if you really wanted to along the way, it's not like it would shoot up to $100 overnight, there's a lot of market to move a lot of coins, and you'd have plenty of opportunities.

"Hi! I wanted to pick your brain of what you think of stablecoins. There are a couple based on ethereum smart contracts. The most used one is called DAI made my makerdao. Makerdao.com. For someone getting paid on crypto, I think it’s immensely beneficial. 1 dai = 1 USD enforced by collateral and smart contract magic

Here’s a link to explain how it works on the backend. 

https://medium.com/cryptolinks/maker-for-dummies-a-plain-english-explanation-of-the-dai-stablecoin-e4481d79b90

Dai is an ethereum ERC20 token and the tx fees are cheap as well. It’s easy to store as any ethereum wallet can hold it. In fact, with myetherwallet you can directly exchange for dai without anything leaving your ledger or trezor. 

Anyway - I just think a stable coin probably eliminates the big hurdle of volatility in crypto. The other hurdle is obviously transactions per second and I see the bch is solving that pretty well with the 32 mb blocksize. Ethereum is going go with a few different solutions - vitalik just published a sharding spec which essentially allows the blockchain to work in parallel instead of in sequence. Each shard would have ethereums current transactions per second (its peaked at 1.2 million per day) and the current spec is to have 100 shards which would equal to 1000 tx per second which would be visa level. Other scalability improvements will be plasma, plasma cash, and a form of a lightning network called raiden.

"Still, the best that would give you is the use of ""Bitcoin"" for BCH as a colloquial term in a familiar context, where there's no doubt whatsoever what is being referred to. I mean, show me one Forex site where you can buy ""dollars"" and they don't make it clear whether you get American or Zimbabwean ones.

Names can change, sure, but here it would be the opposite, the name stays the same, but suddenly refers to something else (and for the same target audience).

"Block size has proved to be a remarkably contentious issue throughout the history of bitcoin, keeping Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash enthusiasts at each other's throats. Tribalism aside, both are goofy and outmoded at this point.

Despite the downsides of a larger block size, bitcoin could still have increased it without any real downsides. 8MB might have been a little much, but it was still far preferable to the clogged and useless state of the bitcoin network at the height of December's hype. Bitcoin simply wasn't ready for that level of popularity, which saw it take a step backwards in acceptance. The number of merchants accepting bitcoin actually dropped as it became more popular. Simply raising the block size would have helped enormously, so it's a shame that no consensus could be reached.

At the same time, a bigger block size isn't an actual scaling solution. By itself, it cannot scale to the extent needed, and the downsides make it unsustainable in the long run. But for some reason, the one trick ponies on the Bitcoin Cash development team are at it again.

Bitcoin's own scaling solution, the lightning network, is infinitely more creative, effective and widely applicable than mindlessly bumping up the block size. The only problem is that it's more of a feature for use in specific transaction types than an actual network-wide scaling solution. The only reason it is even being considered as an actual scaling solution is that the inherent deficiencies of bitcoin put more practical solutions out of reach.

So through a friend of mine who mined bitcoin, I decided to buy some directly from him. (He also sold 5,000 bitcoin for a new video card to mine more back in the day KEK)

She found out about it and during mediation exclaimed she wanted half. The mediator was just like, ""What the fuck is this ....bitcorn?"" so I told him it was like internet points. The mediator looked at me like I was a fucking moron. Like, ""Why did you spend your savings on fucking internet points?"" No one took her seriously.

Now don't think I'm rich, I'm not. I have managed to HODL this whole time. I'm happy enough with what I got. The best part is that she totally knows I still have it, and it's too far past the divorce to ever challenge it at this point.

"Block size limits should be similar to how civil engineers plan for extreme events like 50-year storms or 100-year storms. 

Bitcoin Cash needs to decide what trade offs are acceptable in terms of throughput, speed of clearing backlogs, average demand, and a method of determining plausible but historic events that cause lots of transactions. A formula should be made. 

For isntance, Cryptokitties added (at its peak) up to 50,000 extra transactions a day on the Ethereum network. That was a plausible, but historic event that caused a crazy level of transactions. 

Bitcoin Cash wants to be prepared for events like that before they occur so the network doesn't suffer until the next hard fork can happen to increase the block size again. 

Until a proper formula is made, 32mb will probably be good for now. When average block size over a period of a few weeks is 10% of the block limit, then it's likely worth the discussion to bump up the block size again. ",1525292912

"&gt; Is it not likely that BCH will end up suffering the same fate as it gains more users and block space becomes more sparse?

No, because BCH devs are committed to always increasing the block size far ahead of that possibility and the current demands, and because our long-term goal is to actually remove the block cap entirely.

BTC could have prevented that scenario on their own coin from happening, except that the goals of the Core devs was to make it hard/expensive to use on-chain transactions so that people would be forced to use 2nd layer solutions like Lightning, so when fees got high they were happy about this and tried to justify it.

The real reason they want people on 2nd layer solutions is because the Core devs cannot earn a single penny from on-chain transactions, despite controlling the protocol. So they realized that if they move most transactions onto a 2nd layer, they and their allies can earn transaction fees that way, and miners cannot.

In fact you can google ""Blockstream Liquid"" to find the plan for a private side-chain using private mining hardware in which Blockstream / Core would reap all fees on that network. This is the direction they're working towards, and they will likely justify it as an optional service, even when BTC fees are too expensive to do much with.",1525292765
"**Bitcoin Bulls Seek Breakout to $10K or Higher**

https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-bulls-seek-breakout-10k-higher/

Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading in a narrowing price range over the past week, but a bullish breakout is looking likely, the technical charts suggest.

The cryptocurrency created a bearish outside-day candle last Wednesday, signaling the rally from the low of $6,425 had run out of steam. However, the bitcoin bulls ensured there was no negative follow-through on Thursday and defended $8,800 over the weekend.

While a convincing break above $9,500 has remained elusive so far, the charts suggest the bulls have the stronger hand going forward.

View

Bitcoin will likely witness a bull-pennant breakout and rise towards $9,975 (200-day MA) and $10,000 (psychological hurdle).

A daily close (as per UTC) above $10,000 could bring a stronger rally to $11,306 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from $19,891 to $6,000).

A downside break of the pennant pattern would weaken the bulls and expose support lined up at $8,490 and $8,104 (50-day MA).

Only a daily close below $7,823 (April 17 low) would signal bear revival.",1525292759

Currently hold 3 coins and BNB is one of them. I've been invested in this space since ETH was $12 - there's my second coin.

"&gt;When governments increase supply it's a hidden tax which gives the government money by devaluing the money everyone else holds. There's no such core body in Bitcoin who would be able to give themselves more Bitcoin regardless of what other parties want as any such attempt would just result in the formation of a new chain which no one else would want to use.

Bitcoin miners are increasing supply and giving it to themselves, and then selling it on at a huge mark up. This is different only to the extent that theoretically anyone can print bitcoin (anyone with the money to invest in a bunch of ASICs, is a member of a pool that can offset the risk of not being randomly rewarded and has access to cheap electricity - i.e. a tiny percentage of the worlds population). 

That the amount they can mine is limited by a protocol doesn't change that.

If your base problem is with any increase of the money supply for personal gain then already the protocol is broken by allowing individuals to inflate the money supply for their own benefit.

If increasing the number of coins itself isn't a problem, but only it being done in a particular way, then the question is exactly what is going to happen in 122 years that means we will have gone from a state of affairs where inflating the money is beneficial to one where it isn't.

Assuming there's still a need to increase the number of coins now, how can you predict there won't be a need to increase them in future?

&gt;If instead, you decide to increase the supply by increasing the block reward - who would be willing to accept that? Only miners as everyone who is holding Bitcoin would have their holdings diminished. In such a case users would want to stay on the old non-increased supply chain, and you would probably see game theory resulting in it being in the best interests of individual miners to stay on the old chain.

If miners decided to abandon Bitcoin in favor of another crypto with greater block rewards, what would be securing your billions of dollars of immutable value? Users desktop rigs?

It's not ""maths"" securing Bitcoin, its an economic game theory that it will be more profitable for miners to secure the network than to break it. As long as miners are rewarded in Bitcoin then there's a clear incentive not to devalue bitcoin. Once they're only making money from fees then it doesn't matter what the value of bitcoin is, so long as its something, its the % fee that matters, or what else they can make money from their mining rigs (i.e. breaking the network).

Having to increase fees to cover costs of securing the network introduces a direct competitive impediment to mining other coins where they can keep fees low and make money just off rewards.

The more valuable the network becomes to break, and the less profitable the network is to secure, the more likely it becomes for miners to defect and raid the bank they're meant to be guarding.",1525292227

3. Development community size and its activity

We then sent sample transactions to that network and then verified that they were recorded in the blockchain and that the network achieved consensus.

&gt; For the four chains — **ARK, EOS, LISK, and Tendermint** — we used the documentation provided by the project (or code when documentation was not available) to build an automated peer-to-peer network with the ability to execute transactions and elect delegates by vote based on the stakeholders balance. We implemented the same use case on each of the four blockchains.

&gt; Our engineers recorded their analysis of each peer-to-peer network.


&gt; **Based upon our evaluation criteria, EOS is the best fit for the implementation** of WAX while also being one of the most popular platforms with high number of contributors and release frequency. EOS allows WAX DPOS implementation largely through configuration and small code modifications. Also, EOS provides a framework to implement WAX smart contracts and transactions while having existing scaffolding for Wallet and WAX Connect clients.

Here is a link to their analysis of not just EOS but the other platforms they looked at, their evaluation matrix of the platforms is worth taking a look at:

My point is that it is ridiculous for bch to compare themselves to btc and pat themselves on the back for easily explained phenomenon. 

 Litecoin is faster and cheaper than Bitcoin to transact. So is Dodge and so is BCH. So are a hundred other altcoins. The fundamental reason is that all of them have minimal transactions when compared to BTC. You guys pretend that the larger blocks (that you already have difficulty filling) is the reason for fast/cheap txns when most obviously it is not, because both ledgers are public and anybody can see the truth for themselves.

In any case, Bitcoin is addressing this issue which annoys bch no end and the LN attracts a lot of outside hostility. Who cares what outsiders think anyway. My last transaction cost me 26 cents to send $550. I don't think that is outrageous. Possibly you do?

"Rentberry.com launched their token, BERRY, in their $30million ICO earlier this year.  Here's a bit more about them and the innovation they bring to the market:

- Rentberry raised $30,000,000 in their ICO, and $4,000,000 prior to that from investors. This put them as one of the most highly desired and widely adopted ICO’s of 2018 to-date.

- The quality of the Rentberry core team is exceptional compared with a vast majority of other blockchain projects: Their CEO comes from a background of working at Cisco, Deloitte and several investment firms. Prior to this, he led a team that launched and successfully exited another tech startup before Rentberry. Their CTO holds a degree from Stanford in Management Science and Engineering, and has previously worked as an engineer for industry leaders such as Altera and Amazon Music. The rest of their team are roughly 40-strong, and many of which have worked together on projects for a number of years.

- Rentberry has a vibrant and engaged community of participants and supporters - from their 28,000 Twitter followers, to the 15,000+ followers on their Telegram channel.

- Much innovation is built directly into the Rentberry platform - one of the major reasons for the project garnering as much attention as they have. Blockchain tech will allow for high levels of transparency and accountability throughout the life cycles of every tenancy. During the application process, immutable records of all previous interactions of both the renter and landlord will be provided for each and an algorithmic-bidding system will be used by tenants to place bids on properties which they would like to lease.

- One of the core features of the Rentberry platform will be the ability for BERRY token holders to collectively crowdfund the security deposits of tenants - allowing for renters to secure properties without such a high barrier to entry, and earning a passive income of roughly 7% for the lending token holders in the process.

- Rentberry is a respected leader within the blockchain industry - gaining significant media exposure prior to their token offering, and being one of a minority of crypto-startups to launch their ICO with a pre-established platform in place. The Rentberry web app has been live for the past 3 years - and the tech being built into their service only enhances the functionality that already exists.

- Rentberry are expanding internationally late in 2018, and will be offering global users the opportunity to leverage a range of innovative features when renting and leasing properties.
After being caught up in the months-long bear market at the beginning of 2018, many ICO’s participants watched as the value of BERRY moved lower with the rest of the market. 

- A significant majority of those holding BERRY tokens today participated at roughly $0.33 during the ICO, and are avid supporters of the vision and future roadmap of the Rentberry Team. With such support, and after seeing much of the rest of the industry recover in recent weeks, BERRY could likely see a return to their ICO price and higher - meaning about a 5x increase in value compared to today’s price.

- A number of highly anticipated announcements are just over the horizon at Rentberry, including partnership announcements, feature additions to their platform and the completion and launch of their mobile app in the coming months. For updates and direct access to announcements as they are made, one of the admin team on their Telegram channel will be able to direct you to their community announcement page.

- And last but not least, unlike a number of crypto-projects that are here to raise what they can at ICO and then slip into obscurity, along with the hopes and dreams of their participants, the team behind Rentberry have a long-standing and proven track record, and continuously reiterate the importance they place in building quality and value into their platform. 




So that was the long answer - the short answer is that Rentberry have the fundamentals that so many other projects do not. They are here for the long run, and once many other projects have faded, it’s likely that Rentberry will have grown to dominate the long-term rental market in many parts of the world.

"There sure is demand, it is on other blockchains. Unless you just totally don't pay any attention to anything going on in the crypto world, Ethereum and Steem blockchain do more tx per day than Bitcoin and have been doing so for sometime.

When Ethereum upgrades to POS and enables Plasma(chains within chains within chains within chains within chains within chains within chains inifinitely) you will see. All of the developers who are making programs people are going to use, businesses are going to use are on Ethereum. Ethereum is going to have literally infinite capacity due to the Plasma Side Chains. And it onnly takes 1 tx commited to the Ethereum network to be provable for all of the tx done on side chains(and you don't have to be online 24/7 like idiotic Lightning Network needs, nor do you have to lock up coins).

Steem blockchain all tx are free and it does more tx a day than Ethereum does.

So to say ""why raise blocksize without demand"" show how ignorant you are. There is plenty of demand and it went to other places.

Vitalik literally created Ethereum because of how toxic Bitcoin and it's devs are and how they disabled smart contracts and limited blocksize to 1 MB. Now Ethereum has all these huge projects that bitcoin doesn't have due to not being allowed to have smart contracts. Smart contracts ARE EVERYTHING. Bitcoin just sends money from person to person, smart contracts can quite literally become operating systems and the funcitionality that can be programmed on them is endless.

"&gt; I tend to agree, but then the faction that originally proposed SegWit2x as it was structured cannot subsequently claim your position without exposing their own hypocrisy. 

I only care about one metric: what blocks are being extended.

&gt; I suppose we're really considering two different things here, pure Nakamoto Consensus as assessed by the network itself, and Nakamoto Consensus as put forth and understood by factions of the Bitcoin community. If these issues ever reach an arbiter or a courtroom, I contend the latter understanding may have significant sway. 

*You* are the one who cites the whitepaper for this:

&gt; That's just it, if you hold that Nakamoto Consensus ratified SegWit2x at lock-in, then in order for it to continue to be valid from that point, block 494,783 would've needed to be mined with 2x activated for that block chain to remain valid per the white paper

Your argument is simply wrong. You asked to be proven wrong. There you go. Will that change your mind? Of course not, you'll find some other excuse to keep telling yourself that bcash is bitcoin.

&gt; Taking your position, we are simply left with our current situation (will BCH ever achieve market dominance -- if it does, Nakamoto Consensus strikes again),

No. There were two chain at the fork. Bitcoin kept the name, the chain continued. Bcash didn't get the support. And to be honest, you were all (most at least) considering it bitcoin untill 2x failed. Then suddenly you change your mind lol. What a joke. If you can see the logic in this, good for you, but then I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.

&gt; but it's still clear objectively that SegWit1x's inclusion on the BTC block chain has only been achieved by leveraging the communtiy's lack of understanding about strict Nakamoto Consensus.

who the hell cares. Only one thing matters. What blocks are being extented. And I don't think there was ever mined a 2x block even, as the Garzik's fat fingers hit a minus instead of a plus when he wrote the code and all the 2x nodes crashed a block before activation.

&gt; It's a trick that clearly worked this once, but with the precedent notarized by the block chain forever, I'm betting it's not going to work again any time soon. It's also a betrayal that won't soon be forgotten, and that may have long-term implications that are only clear if and when BCH does achieve market dominance.

What trick? Bitcoin Core writes some software. People can decide to run it or not. People didn't want 2x, and didn't run the 2x software. Are people supposed to run some different software just because miners signal that they should? Lol, welcome to a decentralized currency my friend.",1525290060

"I think you're mistaken about the meaning of ""inflation"".  We're not talking about price volatility. 

It has nothing to do with price, 0 to do with price, absolutely unrelated.  

Inflation is about the supply of a certain currency.

Governments print money constantly, that's inflation.  And sometimes there is hyperinflation, when the governments just print money like crazy, devaluing the currency to nothing, because there is more of it.

The bitcoin protocol dictates that every block 12.5 BTC are created \(every 10 minutes\) Since there are already 17 million BTC created already, this year's rate is around 4&amp;#37; inflation. After 2020 the rate will be less than 2&amp;#37;

You're asking the wrong questions, it's more important to ascertain if the bitcoin supply is becoming more distributed or less. The current distribution is interesting but less important than the trend.

Bitcoins supply may be more centrally distributed than ideal, this however doesn't make bitcoin itself centralized.  However, this is also hard to measure since the largest wallets are mostly exchanges where the bitcoin belongs to hundreds of thousands (millions?) of people.

Further, bitcoin is distributed better than pretty much every other crypto and I've yet to see a better way to distribute a decentralized currency.

If VISA was charging your customers massive fees for each transaction you'd just remove them. You wouldn't complain about how you couldn't remove them because they are popular, that would be moronic. So why do it with cryptocurrencies?

If you didn't offer BTC, then your users wouldn't choose it and then they wouldn't leave your platform after being hit with high fees.

"@giacomozucco tweeted:

&gt; 1) Bitcoin is one of the greatest financial opportunities in human history. **If anyone** interested in wealth &amp; **misses it**/fucks up w/ it, **qualifies as** ***stupid***. I get from your other tweets that you're not interested in wealth (I am), so at least this point doesn't really concern you.

I consider this pretty arrogant and ignorant. User @giacomozucco apparently takes it for granted that Bitcoin will succeed, but in fact nothing can be taken for granted, and nothing is 100% certain about the future. This is arrogance. Even though probably around 98% of the bitcoiners are quite convinced about Bictcoin's value proposition and consequently its success and future price increase, this does not have to be true.

From a non bitcoiner's perspective (and yes, there are non-Bitcoiner's on this planet, some simply because they have a non-tech and non-finance background or are busy with other things in their life), the Bitcoin phenomenon still looks like one of these many bubbles that existed in the distant as well as near past, and they are naturally critical.

"&gt; The guy specifically said about creating a Fork from Bitcoin main network, so the whitepaper would be the bitcoin whitepaper, as I'm sure you know it doesn't give specifics of implementation but rather how it should be solved in general.

Who the hell made that rule? You can write whatever you want in a whitepaper - bgold has a whitepaper, and it forked from bitcoin. He specifically wanted to create a coin name Bitcoin Core. If he wants I said he can write a whitepaper and define the name. He can make a blog post saying ""this is the coin Bitcoin Core, heres how it works"". He can go to https://forkgen.tech/ fill out the form and get a binary that he can run lol. Who cares? You just give it a name. Define it somewhere. The client names implementing the protocol has *no bearing on the name of the protocol*. Is that so hard to understand?

&gt; So where is the code that every Bitcoin node should follow for those specifics? up until the Bitcoin Cash fork it was https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin. So it makes sense to say that Bitcoin Core is what defines how Bitcoin should behave, 

No it doesn't. The client Bitcoin Core, when you start it, connect to other peers on the Bitcoin network, which is a set of concensus rules. In order to loosen (for example accept larger blocks) and get have the new concensus rules be called bitcoin you'd have to;

1) kill off the old chain completely (then theres no question)
2) in case you dont (and we have a contentious hardforfork) and have to viable chains, the bitcoin name goes to the chain that has most hasnpower and acceptance with merchants/exchanges.

&gt; sometimes against the definition of Bitcoin in the whitepaper (as is the case with SegWit, which breaks both the definition of transaction and electronic coin presented in the whitepaper, among other things that were broken that have nothing to do with Segwit such as transaction order preference).

First, the whitepaper is not a doctrine. Its a design document to describe the code that was release initially. You can change anything about bitcoin. Change the mining algo. Change if from blockchain to DAG. Who cares. Its what you get concensus for that counts.

Second, segwit breaks nothing in relation to the whitepaper.

&gt; And if you're going down the line of Bitcoin Core is not the definition of Bitcoin, then why Bitcoin Cash is not Bitcoin? Saying that it's not the longest chain does not make it not Bitcoin, it just makes it not the majority decision.

Bcash is not bitcoin because bitcoin is bitcoin. Had you killed off the original chain you forked from then there'd be no question. Instead the original chain lived, with majority hashpower and user adoption. There was no question. Hell, even Bitcoin ABC claims it implements the ""Bitcoin Cash protocol"", so its not even claiming to be bitcoin.

"It's apples and oranges though. You say we can collectively raise the cap on bitcoin, but how would that work exactly? 

When governments increase supply it's a hidden tax which gives the government money by devaluing the money everyone else holds. There's no such core body in Bitcoin who would be able to give themselves more Bitcoin regardless of what other parties want as any such attempt would just result in the formation of a new chain which no one else would want to use. 
 

Taking a different approach then;

Bitcoin's are sub dividable to 100 million Satoshis. If you just increase the number of bitcoins everyone has (say by a factor of 10) it's meaningless as you've just changed things so that Bitcoin are sub dividable to one extra useless digit. 

If instead, you decide to increase the supply by increasing the block reward - who would be willing to accept that? Only miners as everyone who is holding Bitcoin would have their holdings diminished. In such a case users would want to stay on the old non-increased supply chain, and you would probably see game theory resulting in it being in the best interests of individual miners to stay on the old chain.

How I use it: I store my 24 word seed hidden, but its readable and useable if someone finds it. I keep a small amount of BTC on it, and I monitor the balance on it.

"I tend to agree, but then the faction that originally proposed SegWit2x as it was structured can not subsequently claim your position without exposing their own hypocrisy.  

But I suppose we're really considering two different things here, pure Nakamoto Consensus as assessed by the network itself, and Nakamoto Consensus as put forth and understood by factions of the Bitcoin community. If these issues ever reach an arbiter or a courtroom, I contend the latter understanding may have significant sway.  

Taking your position, we are simply left with our current situation (will BCH ever achieve market dominance -- if it does, Nakamoto Consensus strikes again), but it's still clear objectively that SegWit1x's inclusion on the BTC block chain has only been achieved by leveraging the communtiy's lack of understanding about strict Nakamoto Consensus. It's a trick that clearly worked this once, but with the precedent notarized by the block chain forever, I'm betting it's not going to work again any time soon. It's also a betrayal that won't soon be forgotten, and that may have long-term implications that are only clear if and when BCH does achieve market dominance.",1525287221

"&gt; When the forks stop, we can discuss again

Alright!

&gt; If you'd like to make the case that Merkle Tree + Shnorr + CJ transactions aren't sufficiently anonymous, you'll have to make that case specifically..

When these are applied in Bitcoin in a way that renders all Bitcoin equal and impossible to taint/blacklist (thus, fungible), we can discuss again.

&gt; Monero is alpha software...

Interesting! I said that in a comment yesterday. I agree.

&gt; Just because Monero is better than 99% of the shitcoins out there doesn't mean it's a viable alternative to BTC. 

You mean 'alternative' as an option or 'alternative' as it's going to surpass and render Bitcoin obsolete? Monero is the current alternative for people who have high threat models who need absolute privacy. There are multiple cases of people getting busted by Bitcoin ledger analysis. I didn't say it will overcome Bitcoin.

&gt; If BTC fails to achieve cryptocurrency nirvana, how much can you really trust what comes up behind it?

I don't. If BTC fails, in my opinion, pretty much everything else will fail.

&gt; Monero is one of the few altcoins I won't call an outright shitcoin, it's a great development project, but to pretend it's a contender is asinine.

It isn't, not in its current state at least. As I said, it's the alternative for people seeking higher levels of privacy. Not even once I said it's a 'contender' to Bitcoin?

I really don't understand what you're debating here. My first comment is that Monero is a solid project. Then you said it wasn't solid. Then I went to explain why I believe it's a solid project and its differences from Bitcoin, while saying that I respect the different opinions we might have about what makes ""sound money"". I never stated Monero is generally a better option than Bitcoin, but your comment really tries to paint my previous comments as if they came someone who thinks Monero will shit over Bitcoin which is simply not true.",1525286966

This is how dictionaries work. Lexicographers don't analyze the reasons why something is or should be called something. Instead, they look for examples of actual usage by educated persons. As a result, words and phrases change their meanings over time as educated people change their language over time.

I fail to see how the lightening network can be centralised as I am free to open a channel with whomever I see fit (explanation in other comment about how it can be cheap). Yes my salary may come through the same channel but I can use any channel to spend it. At a certain point the lightening network will have a network effect greater than the sum of its main hubs ( these will be present at its inception due to limited adoption). Once this occurs I can receive my salary through 1 channel or 100 simoultaniously (depending on parallel payment development). My employer is no longer required to pay me via the channel with the bank ( whoever their payment processor is with sufficient channel size) and smarter businesses who want to cut costs will go p2p. Think of it when bitcoin was new you had one wallet no exchanges and needed software skills to receive bitcoin.

for services that could almost be free but not quite.

resizeable and you can enter as long of a message as you like.
It's sent directly when it connects. The recipient doubleclicks
on the transaction to see the full message. If someone famous is
getting more e-mail than they can read, but would still like to
have a way for fans to contact them, they could set up Bitcoin and
give out the IP address on their website. ""Send X bitcoins to my
priority hotline at this IP and I'll read the message personally.""

free trial so it doesn't cannibalize subscriptions could charge
bitcoins for the trial.

enough people think the same way, that becomes a self fulfilling
prophecy. Once it **gets bootstrapped,** there are so many
applications if you could effortlessly pay a few cents to a
website as easily as dropping coins in a vending machine.

Honestly though governments must stop fucking with crypto. We dont even know what kind of effect platforms like ETH will have on computing and businesses in the coming years.

We wanted to add a quick note about our other favorite app: Memo.

**It is truly remarkable what the Memo team and community has accomplished and we wanted to congratulate everyone on an amazing platform and community. Congrats!**

This is our attempt at building for the Bitcoin Cash community, because we believe this is the future and truly the best community to be a part of.

We will publish the BlockPress Protocol shortly (we just wanted to get the release out asap!) -- it is a protocol that will allow us to pursue a radical vision for a new type of social network and we felt it was best to stick with the protocol format we came up with to give us flexibility and not cause problems with other networks.

Thanks again and we hope to hear your thoughts!",1525285862
"If it goes up, it's brilliant. If it goes down, it could ruin your life.

Why not look towards saving money on stuff you are wasting money on, and dirverting those savings into crypto?

I.e. not buying a $5 starbucks that you normally buy? Put it in a jar and drain the jar into crypto at the end of the week.

Cut your phonebill? Cut your TV bill? Cutback on eating out? Grow some tomatoes instead of buying them at the store? Track that shit, then spend THAT money.

It's not flashing, but that's how you save/invest without impacting your future, even if this thing all evaporates (obviously I think that's not going to happen or I wouldn't be here, but we should plan for the worst and hope for the best).

Here's a good example... you want even more money?

Live in a city where you can get a rental easy, and you are single? Try renting a van and living in the van for the summer. Sounds insane, but I did that for 6 years after graduating school, and it let me buy my first house with cash from money I saved up. Sure it was a piece of shit house, but I bought it with cash, fixed it up as I lived in it, then flipped it and bought my next house with cash.

Want to know how to ""win life""? Crush down your debt.

Want to get into crypto? Cut bills, crush debt, use that money you saved to invest in your future self.

You can live without ANYTHING for a month. So cut it, try it, and even if it didn't work, bring that thing back and hell, you at least saved 1 month bill of it. If it worked and you can handle the loss of that ""convenience"", then bam, more crypto money.

Sure it may suck to have no Netflix, but how nice is retiring at 40?

I'm pretty extreme in this way, I totally get it. I probably sound nuts to many of you. But nothing sets you up for success in life like keeping the fucking banks hand out of your pocket.

THAT is why I take so naturally to crypto... it's just such a natural fit for me and my life philosophy.",1525285777

"TLDW: This lecture includes a clear explanation of what one would expect to see happen after a contentious hard fork in Bitcoin. This video was published long before Aug. 1, 2017.

In a nutshell, (for part of the video):

""After a hard fork:
If fork was meant to start an altcoin, 
altcoin goes its separate way,
branches coexist nicely

**If fork reflected a fight over future of Bitcoin:
branches fight for market share
branches fight to be seen as ""the real Bitcoin""
probably one branch wins, the other melts away""

""If that's the case then the two branches are rivals. The branches will fight for market share...Each branch will try to get more merchants to accept it. Each branch will try to get more people to buy it...There is a public relations fight between them.""

The lecturer also addresses the huge question of who has the power in the Bitcoin ecosystem:
*Developers? 
*Miners? 
*Investors?
*Merchants and their customers
*Payment services

Spoiler: all of the above, in a messy way.

I have watched this video once before but am planning to rewatch (later - it's long!). Thanks for sharing this.

"Fair point about the life of the channel. I think he was more aiming the point at how it would be impossible for some guy in sub sahara to make a L1 tx when he will only ever have €10 in his account and the fees will be much higher than that (presuming one crypto rules the world). So though technically L1 is censorship resistant, it is only for people who can afford the fees. Is there enough of a gain here for the entire world to switch to that format? The markets will decide.

But one thing worth noting. In the west we all want everything for free now. Telling someone they will have to pay money to move their paycheck to the LN is a risky move (in the EU bank transfers are free for years now); being paid in the LN itself would just bring back centralisation (you would be paid automatically in the LN to avoid charges, which leads to the catch 22 about whether bitcoin is then censorship resistant for the wealthy only).

"&gt; Still, all the agreements going in were so straightforward, I'm confident history, any objective arbiter, or even a courtroom, could make an obvious determination that SegWit2x was promised but never delivered, violating Nakamoto Consensus.

The requirement for a trusted arbiter is a breakdown in the expected qualities of Bitcoin. The voting by majority hash power alone is supposed to be sufficient. I don't think this is a shortcoming intrinsic to Bitcoin itself, rather it is a failure of the chosen signalling mechanism to embed evidence explicitly defining the expectations.

A simple example of how this could have been implemented would be to include the hash of an agreement document in the coinbase inputs. Failure to fulfill the agreement could then be demonstrated to a future observer by providing the original document as evidence of the expectations which had met majority consensus.

A more robust solution would be to define expected behavior using a formally verifiable language, and signalling via inclusion of its hash. This would have the additional advantage of providing testable behavioral conditions while allowing freedom in node implementation, delivering the strong compatibility assurance of a reference implementation without the risk of development capture. Such a solution would provide a truly open and uncensored forum for proposing and voting on rule modifications - the blockchain itself.",1525284503

If you'd like to adhere to the whitepaper definition of Bitcoin instead, *guess what*, it's still the real Bitcoin. Altcoins (like BCH) don't have enough cumulative work to even come *close* to qualifying as actual Bitcoin. The only reason BCH is able to survive is because they introduced *decidedly* non-Bitcoin consensus rules (the EDA) to get around the chain outright disappearing.

"That's a vague non-answer to the fact that something being limited in supply doesn't give it intrinsic value.

If you think it has some intrinsic value why don't you say it instead of dancing around it with ""performs something of value"" and ""[has] any use that otherwise isn't fulfilled elsewhere"".

None of those vague claims require intrinsic value.

Bitcoin doesn't have any intrinsic value as proven by the fact you can copy the code exactly and make 1 meaningless change that doesn't effect its utility at all and fork it and the fork will be worthless even though its functionally identical to bitcoin.

"Bitcoin will likely be #1 in terms of price, but not in terms of % growth when you consider altcoins. I still hold BTC it's a good investment and has upward momentum, but it's good to diversify crypto holdings.

"That's just it, if you hold that Nakamoto Consensus ratified SegWit2x at lock-in, then in order for it to continue to be valid from that point, block 494,783 would've needed to be mined with 2x activated for that block chain to remain valid per the white paper. This is because consensus was already applied previously, at lock-in, expressing *network* approval of the 2x code intent. If a legal body were involved in trying to determine whether BTC or BCH has more legitimacy in claiming the ""Bitcoin"" name, I think this could be a very successful argument.  

However, if you're going to say this form of Nakamoto Consensus ratification of locked-in but not activated code is in itself not a valid extension of Nakamoto Consensus, then any agreement that has the structure of SegWit2x was invalid, and will be invalid in the future. It also means that any previous protocol change that included any form of pre-activation signalling or voting only achieved Nakamoto Consensus basically as a fully independent event (by accident, as it were; the voting/signalling was entirely irrelevant.) Taken to the extreme, it means all signaling going forward will be irrelevant, which is, to me a least, not a very useful precedent. 

I prefer to see it as the highest profile example so far of how careful the community needs to be in implementing contentious changes, and exactly how far is too far in creating a valid consensus agreement that can actually get the Nakamoto Consensus reflective of pre-activation signalling or voting. If SegWit *and* 2x had been coded to activate at the same time in SegWit2x, I think it's likely we would not have this troublesome precedent now.",1525283677

"Just read the article and have to say he sounds like a used car salesman. He hasn't addressed any of the criticisms in the tweets. I'm all for competition but at some point there will be a single protocol that underpins the financial system, I believe this will be bitcoin due to the catch 22 the network is in. If miners leave the network it becomes more decentralised and the protocol will continue in a healthier state, then the network will grow and miners will jump back in.

Addressing his point about access to the base layer in his article. I will admit L2 solutions will never be as secure as L1 however all users of L2 have access to L1 using the Lightning network as an example channel closures are handled by L1 using the most recent reported channel state. If you make 100000 transactions within the life of that channel once the channel is closed all of those transactions are as secure as if they had been done on L1 individually. The only difference is you payed for 2 onchain transactions instead of 100000.

As a explainer everyone expects access to the justice system in western countries (L1) but you don't expect a police officer to follow you 24 hrs a day. If you ring 999, 911 or whatever number you ring in your country you will have access to the justice system.

My personal opinion: I am a Bitcoin maximalist, so the past and future alt-coin ambitions add no value for me, neither. Still many in the community want to claim their ""air-drops"" from fork coins and many others are less maximalist. With the modularization we've been working on for two years, alt-coins will be added with almost no changes to the core app, which makes it very secure for people that don't bother installing those extensions. My take on SegWit you find on the other comments here.

"&gt; Scalability and the never ending onslaught of hard forks is untenable.

Scalability is also a problem in Bitcoin? Lightning Node is also applicable to Monero by the way. Nothing new there.

The 6-month hard fork system is a temporary one so the protocol can keep getting important updates that are being developed quite fast. This is not going to be a ongoing thing forever. Core developers and other community members already stated it. u/smooth_xmr said once (can't find his comment on reddit) that optimally the ""hard fork"" (which is just the technical name for software version upgrade when there's consensus) will happen once every few years, maybe once every 10 years when the protocol gets to its peak performance. So, I agree it's untenable but this is not supposed to keep going _ad infinitum_.

&gt; I'd have to Opt-in to Monero, so I guess by your logic Monero isn't private either?

English is not my first language so I don't understand what you mean. Monero is private by default, you can't just decide your transaction won't use the privacy technologies like stealth addresses, ringCT and ring signatures. This is what makes Monero fungible.

&gt; lol wut? The whole point is that it's trustless. Do you even know what these proposals entail? CoinJoin is nothing like Darksend. If you knew who you were talking to, you'd realize how amusing it is to me that you bring up Darkcoin. I'll just assume you're talking about taint, which is answered by these proposals.

Maybe we can have divergent opinions on this, but I'm not comfortable stating that Bitcoin is fungible if it can be tracked in some form. Unless Bitcoin uses sound technology that will render it obfuscated and private by **default** like Monero (which is a completely different discussion that I would be happy to have), it won't be fungible. And if won't be fungible, it can't become real digital cash -- it can be many valuable things, but not **real** digital cash. But hey, who am I, right? I'm just a random redditor sharing my opinion.

If you visit the darknet markets you will see a lot of people using Monero. Some markets are even Monero-exclusive and won't accept anything else. We may also have different definitions of ""solid"" but in my book that's a solid cryptocurrency that is not vaporware like 99% of the alternatives out there (which has been my point since my first comment).

And never, never forget that I not once said Bitcoin was bad. I'm a privacy advocate so it's just natural that Monero got my attention in a deep way but lord I do love myself some Bitcoin.

"Your transaction will be the same (tiny) burden on the network regardless of how much value you're moving. That's why the fee is often set independent of the value being moved. On Bitcoin Cash, this fee is often set to the minimum supported by most wallets, 1 satoshi per byte (of your transaction's size). Work is being done to support 0.1 satoshi per byte, which is probably rather trivial. The miners get about 12.5 bitcoins per block as well, which halves every 4 years, but the value in other currencies tends to grow far faster than the actual amount halves, so there's little need for fees to cover significant costs any time soon. So far, the fees are simply a token payment to make it bothersome to spam transactions.

That said, the network isn't as vulnerable to spam as some people on r/bitcoin would claim: you can't cause the fees to rise very far by spamming the blockchain full of transactions, as you'll need to pay the same fees. If I'm willing to pay $0.10 per transaction to be included, and you fill up the network with spam paying $0.05 per transaction, my transaction will be included before yours and I won't even notice the effect of your spamming. This effect is amplified by BCH's larger block size, so it costs far more to push fees up to the same level via spam.",1525282738

"VEN marketcap is just over 2.5B, at just under $5 per coin.

EOS marketcap (with zero product, just hype) is 15.4B.

My opinion only, but today you could swap those two and VEN having that marketcap would make more sense than EOS having it. 

At any point, China coming out and being bullish on crypto is going to cause all China coins to surge. There is NO WAY that China (a global superpower) is going to miss out on the crypto tech wave that's coming. So to me that's a 100% probability of occurrence, it's just a question of when.

VEN gaining to the same market cap as EOS, based on the same hype (mainnet launch), but also having dividends by holding coins... just that alone puts VEN at $30. China saying anything bullish about crypto could double the price of Chinese coins, but lets not even consider that. 

Then, consider that I think the overall market is going to grow in the next 4-5 months. I personally think we hit 1T again somewhat soon, by Aug/Sept. Assuming VEN gets at least it's fair share of that increase, you are looking at ~$75 VEN.

So yeah, I think $20-50 is pretty reasonable... $20 if you want to be somewhat conservative (yet optimistic) and closer towards $50 if you think it will go on an EOS like run.

$5 VEN is a joke, and a comically good buy (my own humble opinion of course).",1525282411
"right now, you can say with near 100% certainty that fees on the BCH chain will ~$0.01 or lower tomorrow

fees for the BTC chain could be $10 tomorrow for all we know. They *probably* won't be, but it's happened before and the only thing that has happened that would prevent it from happening again is that people are simply not using BTC as much anymore. As soon as more people want to try to use it again, they'll find it's just as unreliable as it was christmas 2017",1525282386

"&gt;Buffett wrote in his 1996 letter to shareholders. ""If you aren't willing to own a stock for ten years, don't even think about owning it for ten minutes.""

I have invested in the future of our planet and a hope to free people from oppressive corporations (specifically banks) who get all the rules made in their favor.  10 years is nothing compared to the idea that in the future, people can conduct business w/out the blessings of financial monopolies.

&gt; ""[I]f you ban trading in ... bitcoin, which nobody knows exactly what it is, people would say, 'Well why in the world would I buy it?'""

And, there is the rub.  I am investing in the hope that no one will be able to ban bitcoin any more than they could ban the Internet.  There are already programs to enable bitcoin transactions over satellite and other 'out of band' communications mechanisms. Bitcoin is critical to our ability to maintain our freedom of expression (citation: wikileaks).  Bitcoin enables the ""everyman"" to have a form of ""off shore account"" like the rich have enjoyed for decades (centuries?).  Why do they get to secret their money to untraced account, while we are expected to play by the rules that don't apply to them?

Just use electrumX or BWS servers instead of NODE_BLOOM nodes.

"Everyone's seen the hyperinflation pictures at this point.  The wheelbarrows of money and all that.

"You're spouting gibberish. Both are thought-up systems that do not, and will not, exist.

Further, the entire discussion is based on the assumption that 8MB or 32MB will cause significant enough centralization to affect censorship resistance. It's a thought experiment which we've yet to see play out because some are to scared to even try and evolve.

I posit: Let Bitcoin Cash evolve to having a 32MB limit on block size, with average block sizes regularly above 20MB. Let us then look at the data available and discuss that instead of the assumptions of a few self-proclaimed experts whose primary contribution has been to shout ""The sky is falling!"". ",1525281972

"I think I can agree, since that's what it really comes down to. Either you can make legitimate consensus agreements like SegWit2x where things happen at different times, but it still can be fairly ratified by Nakamoto Consensus and held to validity evaluation, or agreements like SegWit2x were invalid from the beginning and can never be expected to hold up. Either way, the faction that put forth the agreement is responsible for the result. They've either made their own block chain forever invalid per the white paper, or they've embedded perhaps their most prominent proof of how duplicitous they are as a failed major fork event on their own block chain.  

Also in either case, SegWit1x's existence on the BTC is invalid (either because it didn't follow Nakamoto Consensus and add 2x as promised, or it was backdoored in by getting improperly packaged into an invalid agreement that could not have been accurately adjudicated by Nakamoto Consensus in the first place).

If you hold the latter, then we're still left with the current situation (seeing if BCH will ever get most cumulative proof-of-work regardless of preceding white paper validity on the BTC block chain), but any future agreements like SegWit2x at least can be judged improper at the outset by the community via this precedent.",1525281848

If BTC existed back then it would not solve the currency's hyperinflation problem.

If BTC existed back then it might shelter individuals from some of the effects, but so did the USD.

There will be a fork and 1 coin will have the BTC name while the other will ends up with something else and there's no guarantee bitcoin core will be able to remain on the BTC side of it...

What would you say then? will BTC still be BTC after the malicious groups takes over and forces a fork? Or will the new coin under bitcoin core's control be the real bitcoin?",1525281765

Also, there is nothing stopping a centralized company from providing this exact service. I believe they currently do this. 

This is driving me crazy. I think blockchain is almost worthless outside Bitcoin.",1525281743
"I like this. If the price ratio between BCH and BTC would get to 1/3 that would be quite something. And if can keep at 1/3 for a couple of months, hash rate will also become 1/3 of BTC.

The day that any other crypto will get 1 to 1 with the BTC price is going to be a historical day. And it's going to be BCH. Because crypto can only go global if there is one that becomes currency. And that can only be BCH. ",1525281738

Presently younger generations are grappling with an old paperbelt world they don't understand and have little interest in getting involved with... since the thought of filling in paperwork and jumping through hoops to move their economic energy around is insanely archaic to them.

When youngsters who grew up as digital natives can invest easily in stocks of companies (and crowdfunds) they believe are making the world a better place, such as Tesla stocks, by simply pushing BTC into those endeavours with a smartphone swipe... we will begin to see a huge shift in capital moving toward more ethical, sustainable businesses.

A year from now that Alt Coin market (which is largely junk) may well look more like the Fortune 500 with *real* businesses (both old world and new) listed alongside their realtime 24/7 crypto stock tickers.  

Boomers need to get to grips with all this too, and there's no reason they won't since all of this is merely an extension of UX principles firmly established by the myriad smartphone apps they're already used of.

...but I was asking curumimxara about his 1% that aren't Bitcoin,1525281357
"&gt; BCH ended up with the new designation but that doesn't mean it's not the original bitcoin.

Actually, that's exactly what it means. The one without changes TO THE CONSENSUS is the ""original bitcoin."" Those with changes are forks. Do you even understand that one of them CHANGED THE CONSENSUS RULES?

It is as absurd as growing a cock on your forehead and claiming that your asshole is actually your mouth, while walking on your hands.

&gt; and as an outsider, from my perspective watching the shit show over the past 2 years saying the current incarnation of BTC is the original bitcoin is just as fraudulent as BCH doing it, they forked because of philosophical differences on how to handle the growth in demand, BCH stuck to the original plan outlined by satoshi while BTC went its own direction (which you're totally allowed to do) but that results in a fork. 

From your description, it's clear that you don't even really understand what happened and have zero awareness of the people behind the forking. Do you think it is some sort of grand coincidence that a massive boatload of b'cash exists from the Gox shit, and Ver lived across the street from Gox? That's literally free money for doing a shitball fork and pumping it with early adopter whale / mining cabal resources. Just a big coincidence that Karpeles is CTO of a company now (CTO... when he literally fucked a website into the ground? LOL. I wouldn't hire him to organize a fucking HTML file) that Ver is associated with via board politics? Mmmmmmm hmmmmmm.

&gt; BCH is the original philosophically

No, it isn't.

And you're omitting where being ""pro BCH"" is just mindlessly parrotting this bullshit over and over and over again. Just stating things tritely and expecting well-measured discourse EVERY. FUCKING. TIME. IT. IS. POSTED.

These discussions were had, the opinions are pretty clear.

Please, point to where EDA and bigger blocks are ""philosophically more pure/correct?"" Neither of them are directly referenced, especially not EDA. And both Hal + Satoshi, as well as Nick were always discussing layer2 as the natural extension... yet there is massive toxicity and false dichotomy about how layer2 is ""bad"" and ""more centralized."" (Ironic coming from the proponents of a coin that is essentially pure centralization).


It's fucking boring at this point, and no hearts and minds EXCEPT FOR THE GULLIBLE AND/OR INEXPERIENCED is being won over. THAT'S why this shilling bullshit has been ousted. Do you even know why reddit, the .com and twitter are the havens? Why /r/btc even started? Why they are literally squatting on the name **AND WERE SQUATTING ON THE NAMES BEFORE THERE WAS EVEN A FORK IN EXISTENCE**

You've got the order all mixed up. You think they developed a fork with these ideas years ago, and then figured out the media strategy? LOL all of the sites CAME FIRST. 

There is so much wrong with b'cash, the bottomline is that it does less fucking volume than a few memecoins and only does that volume due to shilling, deceit and sockpuppetry. 

Why do you not bring up the OTHER altcoins/implementation that FAILED? All with ""bitcoin"" in the name? By the same people?

"The problem with Bitcoin maximalism is that they are mostly right, but maximalism means that they have to be completely right on the claim - all other digital assets are worthless, hold bitcoin at all costs.

This implies that all other digital assets have no value and cannot correctly attain a valuation at a higher % gain than Bitcoin.

This is clearly ridiculous. Especially since something small of value will grow faster % and the odds that no other digital asset holds any value is as likely as Bitcoin having 0 value. Ironically, as a currency, it is this kind of spending that actually increases Bitcoin’s value as trade creates wealth.

The only real defense of maximalism is that it is so early in the game that outpacing hodling is likely to be difficult and that by holding you are providing a great service to bring about the required change for the ultimate goal of Bitcoin. True economic liberation. That said, by increasing and leveling distribution you are also helping.

BTC has failed by putting all their eggs in one basket (lightning network) and shaping their eggs (1MB Block size w/segwit) so that they only fit in that basket.  Unfortunately, the basket (lighting network) is a failure.  Remember how excited everyone was when Lightning Network was going to be launched on mainnet in the summer of 2016?  Oh yeah, that didn't end up happening...delays, ""coming soon"" more delays...and then remember how excited everyone was in january when it was finally launched after all these years of development?  Yep, it'd just be a matter of months as people adopt the new awesomeness... but then...well that isn't happening either.  Adoption of LN has got to be the slowest thing crypto has ever seen.  

Compare LN adoptions to anything in crypto...dogecoin, litecoin, ethereum, ICO's, crypto kitties, new wallets, just about anything.  Heck even memo.cash has more transactions per day than Lightning Network, and Memo is only 2 weeks old!

The only update/new development for BTC/Lightning Network has been a recent proposal that points out flaws in LN that need to be fixed with a soft fork of BTC.  How long is that going to take?!   More problems, more delays while the rest of block chain and crypto keeps on innovating and moving forward.

"**Secure Remote Password protocol**

The Secure Remote Password protocol (SRP) is an augmented password-authenticated key agreement (PAKE) protocol, specifically designed to work around existing patents.

Like all PAKE protocols, an eavesdropper or man in the middle cannot obtain enough information to be able to brute force guess a password without further interactions with the parties for each guess. This means that strong security can be obtained using weak passwords. Furthermore, being an augmented PAKE protocol, the server does not store password-equivalent data.

"You just proved my point. Like Facebook their servers are simply worth what they cost to make. But since they are used to employ facebooks network on they become infinitely more valuable. But it does not have any inherent value so to speak.

Same goes with Bitcoin, it is just like fiat in a way. It has value because we, the network say it has value. And when we compare the two it is very clear what is the best money. Therefore our network will grow, and so will its value.

In truth it is the consensual agreement between the people in the network that gives bitcoin its value. As you probably know a UTXO is simply a piece of data that proves you can make it appear inside a different box essentially.

The same thing goes for a lot of different things too. For example government, there is no inherent value in it. It is the people's coercion or agreement that gives it value. One may have a collective agreement on taxing the people to provide a police force through the government, because the people think that safety is valuable (yet still that too is just an opinion). And some people disagree with the concept other people have of safety, for example is it safety to have a armed guy take plants from people who pose no threat to others, is that valuable? Probably not to the people who just want to be physically safe. But for some reason the police are tasked to do this.

Why? Because a network of people with the power to task them with it, holds the power to say that it is valuable.

Like we hold the power to buy Bitcoin and say it is valuable.",1525280388

People want to pretend that bitcoins supply is secured by ""math"" but its a consensus based protocol which means you can print as many bitcoin as people agree to be printed. Right now the consensus is 21 million, but it could be changed to 21 quadrillion if they wanted.

So the difference is nothing more fundamental than ""yeah but bitcoiners wouldn't want to hyperinflate their currency, but sometimes governments do"", which is a matter of circumstance, not ability.

so far miners and users incentives have been aligned (keep bitcoin going up in price as much as possible), but when mining rewards start to dry up, these incentives will diverge and oppose. Miners will now profit most off maximizing fees and transactions

In theory a bunch of active users can be just as influential as miners and developers, but in practice the latter have much more say over the direction that forks take.

If you look at even soft-forks like Segwit, the average user actually has very little power to influence adoption if big institutional players don't support it.

"I guess this is more a perspective issue. With regard to EOS, there are 21 master nodes - each voted in (""delegated"") by stakeholders (owners of EOS). Each node is independent of one another - both in ownership and geography - so in theory, no single group can control more than 4.8% of the network. And since EOS has programmed in blockchain governance, stakeholders can vote out a master node if they are not behaving in accordance with the preferred direction of the community and/or if they are located in a geo-politically hostile country with regard to decentralization. 

Theoretically, it is not as decentralized as Bitcoin or Ethereum since a single individual can't become a node, but in the case of both, mining is consolidating with some pools representing more than 25% of the network (illustration here: https://i.imgur.com/dFM3U79.jpg). This becomes very concerning with regard to network security and the possibility of a 51% attack. Also, in the long term, what will happen to the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks once all coins are mined and the network has to incentive miners through transaction fees? Will the network remain large and decentralized or will independent nodes drop off since they are no longer mining actual coins?",1525280055

Also the hardware wallet integration might move into a module with SegWit support.

In the immediate future I see these things being worked on:

* performance of the modularized app.
* fixing bugs
* remove module-specific stuff from the core app, making it easier to integrate new modules. The Dash team contributed a lot in that aspect and so far I had far too little time to merge their PRs, as we were pushing for our initial modularization release.

I am not going a mempool analysis before sending every transactions.  I sued to do a quick look at recommended fees website and add 20% on top of that.  But I never used BTC for regular commerce - just to sell it.,1525279510
"why go backwards? 

lte is and always was a joke, no serious bitcoin user cares about it. 

bitcoin users however do care about the whitepaper, which is about bch and not btc",1525279494
Wow behind even bitcoin diamond? Isn't that the one with an anonymous team and no work being done?,1525279452
"I doubt both can thrive. if BTC wants to be bitcoin and bitcoin is a p2p e-cash then btc can't be bitocin.

if btc wants to be a very expensive settlement layer that is slow but everything it does can be done better by bch i don't see hwo thye can co exist",1525279450
"I agree that the market is fluid, but thinking that BCH will ever be able to ""take"" the Bitcoin name away from Bitcoin Core is nonsense. Sure, Facebook was second to MySpace for awhile and eventually won out, but it didn't try to take the name MySpace.

My overall point is that the name war is pointless and BCH should just roll with the BCash name. There are far more important things to do.",1525279443
When will the blocksize be increased? What's the schedule? Because I left BTC after years of not upgrading.,1525279431
"Basically sums up the sentiments of this entire sub.  Ah well, on the bright side, we could be like most of the world and not own any crypto at all.",1525279431
"&gt; Those changes were added following Nakamoto Consensus

No, they explicitly *broke* nakamoto consensus, as defined in the whitepaper.  A minority chain, with minority hashpower, and minority economic support broke multiple Bitcoin Protocol rules, forking themselves onto a new minority chain.  There is no amount of mental gymnastics that can be done to claim that his new minority chain is ""bitcoin"".  Litecoin, Dogecoin, Vertcoin, Decred, and Bitcoin Gold all also implement the Bitcoin Protocol.  They all realize they are minority chains though, and happily accept that they are alternative minority implementations.",1525279399
"But bcash is bitcoin!!! I’m relatively new at bitcoin but I used the btc Reddit never understanding the difference between btc and bch for a while. The more I learned the more BCH followers begun to come off as cultish, irrational, and desperate. 9/10 threads there are some attack on btc. It feels like a stinky hive mind.",1525279364
How does BCH not meet the need with its 0.01$ fees and being identical to BTC in almost every other way?,1525279362
"FT;FU 

Thus by your definition is bitcoin.

Or

Thus by the definition of a small minority of the global population (a majority in this small crypto world) subjectively project BTC is the only bitcoin at this time",1525279350
BTC is bitcoin crippled.,1525279340
"bitcoin was designed to never have full blocks, when btc was taken over and fundamentally changed away from bitocin they chenged this. btc is now nothing like bitcoin",1525279332
"Good read, That’s a problem that needs to be dealt with, some are doing good like TAU. The project is offering Free Transactions, I’m sure a good thing that’ll help people adapt crypto.",1525279326
"Yes, I did in the past in order to buy with fiat and exchange for others.  My fear is that governments will eventually force account registration through exchanges/hubs/merchants in order to buy and sell if it becomes mainstream, and will probably criminalize the private crypto transactions without registered accounts as tax evasion or money laundering.  If you all see a way around this happening then I’m very interested in knowing how it’s possible.",1525279317
"But in the grand scheme of crypto, it's not acceptable what they're doing. Yes I believe people will eventually find out the truth and their propaganda will fail but is just letting them be really the best choice? People need to know the bullshit they pull and get away with. Or so I thought anyways ",1525279316
"I guess.  Given its only 9 months old, BCH is making Bitcoin Core look like a non-perfomer.  In fact a huge part of the reason BCH exists was the complete lack of forward progress of the Bitcoin Core dev team.  For years.  And years.  

At only 9 months BCH is now enabled on over 100,000 merchants through BitPay.  Its a visible payment option on NewEgg.com.  Daily I see new businesses adding support for it.  It really has done more in 9 months than Bitcoin has done in 9 years.

Usage comes much slower.   But give it time.",1525279310
"Buy 1 Bitcoin (BCH) today, and in 20 years if/when nodes are ultra expensive to run because of blocksize and number of transactions, that 1 Bitcoin will afford you the most expensive of nodes to sustain you for the next 100 years. 

This is a win/win bet. If Bitcoin goes through the roof, we’ll need those huge blocks, but you’ll be able to afford the huge node because now you’re a bitcoinaire. 

If it never picks up, transactions will remain low and your 1 btc will still afford you a smaller node for the low-throughout network.

You can’t go wrong! ",1525279303
"For a minority, yes. But the vast majority don’t give a shit about anything you just said and want to get rich quick off crypto",1525279290
"Good solution, but problem is that you can break most sites. For example, single page application (javascript): https://romo.io/crypto/bitcoin-cash/",1525279264
"&gt; The DAA has absolutely nothing to do with validation or consensus

If you truly think that, then you don't understand consensus networks at all.

&gt; What other rules, trollshit?

Are you capable of having a conversation without resorting to petty personal attacks?  It makes your argument look weak.  But other rules that make BCH incompatible with Bitcoin is the change in the tx format and the blocksize limit, all without consensus.  BCH is a minority implementation of the Bitcoin protocol, just like Litecoin, Dogecoin, Vertcoin, Decred, Bitcoin Gold, and others.  All of these altcoins implement the Bitcoin Protocol as described in the whitepaper.  The majority chain is Bitcoin, not BCH.   

Do you have an actual argument, or are you just going to resort to more personal attacks?",1525279261
"Well simply posting here, regardless of whether or not anyone replied, was one of my first attempts to see if it was true if r/bitcoin was really a censor-happy dictatorship :p So far so good...

But you know, it would've been a lot easier if I'd just immediately been banned. Now I actually have to go research shit! Talking to both communities, you both seem super helpful and willing to provide useful information. Very friendly. And you both say the same exact things about each other lol. Main difference, though, is that their front page is filled with lots of attacks on r/bitcoin while r/bitcoin's front page is filled with... bitcoin related posts.

Granted, I do like the cheap fees of BCH (and various other altcoins that have low fees). But this is a whole other level of crazy. I do love a good rabbit hole, though. Thanks a bunch for the info :)",1525279258
"The Bible is already in the Bitcoin blockhain both on BTC and BCH but you need to know where to look. I want to have it so that you can read it thrhough blockchain explorers if really needed. It would be a gimmick but if things ever change, in some countries like China they control infromation very strictly. It would be very hard for humanity to cencor the Bitcoin Blockchain without just destroying the internet. 

Also I believe Revelation 13:16 is related to Bitcoin. ",1525279253
"Just looking for clarification here. What do you mean when you say platform coin?

As an example I would count ETH as a protocol coin, BTC as a transaction coin and would separate platform coins into 2 sub groups closed and open platform cryptos. So Mithril would be a closed platform coin whilst Kin is an open platform coin \(if all goes well\). The difference between the 2 is closed platform coin would be worthless if the ecosystem it was designed for collapses \(Lit app shutdown in the case of Mithril\) as it's only use case is inside the app, whilst open platform coins could be integrated into any ecosystem and that is their goal from the get go.",1525279244

Meanwhile Bitcoin has developed into a cash cow for the largest stakeholders and they're milking it hard. No sensible discussion allowed here lest you be censored.

Add to that all those crypto ""news"" sites constantly linked to. 

Btw: Bitcoin is a kind of fiat money, depending on the definition you use. Only difference is it isn't legal tender. But it isn't inflationary as it is now and the rate of inflation/deflation can't easily be controlled as it can be with government issued fiat.

"Well first of all the Bitcoin protocol is not ""run"" by anyone but it is being developed in a collaborative, open and completely transparent process delivering open source software and it is the users themselves who decide if they want to run it or not.

Second of all Bitcoin is under a massive attack from people who think it is a good idea to centralize the network under their control. That's the big block campaign and you can find evidence that this campaign does not mind centralizing the network (search for 'roger ver paypal 2.0' or watch some videos from the Satoshi-imposter Craig Wright promoting 'banks and corporations' to do the validating for the users).

That camp is smearing Bitcoin with the utmost absurd conspiracy theories about how the Bilderberger and AXA have somehow infiltrated this open source project and how this diverse unorganized group of hundreds of developers have all been corrupted.

In order to see through all this fog you will need to research and learn a lot for yourself. Be warned that this rabbit hole is very deep but once you get to the bottom of it you will be able to see clearly that 'outrageous lies' really are only deployed by the side attacking Bitcoin and not from Bitcoin (Bitcoin as an open source project does not even have the marketing budget the dotcom side has at its disposal).

And please don't fall for the claim that this sub is censored and full of illuminati sockpuppets. I myself have been banned from the fake Bitcoin sub (which uses Bitcoin's ticker symbol but is all about a centralized altcoin that actually has a different ticker symbol) and I have been called a sockpuppet myself multiple times including by a user account that has lateron litererally turned out to be a sockpuppet account of the chief writer of bitcoin dotcom.

Topics discussed included: separation of blockchain &amp; distributed database systems, differences between blockchains and cryptocurrencies or cryptoassets, regulations and protecting unsophisticated investors, blockchain solutions for voting and supply chain auditing.

In my opinion it was a largely fruitless discussion, many key points did not get through to some MPs, and there was some hostility between panel members which derailed or confused some points. There was some contradictions in the recommendations at the end, for example; the business management executive was suggesting that Bitcoin is nearly 10 years old and should have been heavily regulated by now because it allows people to be pseudo-anonymous, and that regulators should not blindly allow innovation. Whereas, others suggested that light-touch regulation is needed so as not to stifle innovation and the development of these use cases.

BTC nodes working ""as usual"" (whatever that means, it's not addressed in the white paper), is irrelevant, because they're no longer validly ""Bitcoin"" per the white paper's Sybil-resistant mechanism for evolution (if they were, they'd have had ""2x"" since 494,783).

"Nice.

A government doesnt have to accept bitcoin in taxes directly. Smart people will hack bitcoin onto the tax department just like they hacked bitcoin onto Amazon through purse.io.

A government will never accept taxes in anything other than their own currency because that would send a huge signal that not even the government wants their own currency. They force fiat for taxes until their fiat experiences a catastrophic collapse in demand, at which point the only revenue source for the government will be crypto! At which point its game over and bitcoin automatically defaults to leagal tender.

But until that time some smart devs will hack it onto the system through other means.

There's also the [BlockSci system](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.02489.pdf) which is used to do analysis in transparent blockchains. They found that for Dash (a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin with a CoinJoin-based mixing service), over half of their test mixed transactions could be traced back with absolute certainty by simply following the transaction amounts.

You either get full privacy by default or it's not private. Unfortunately it's like that. We can argue that privacy is just a ""feature"" or even a ""niche"", which wouldn't be wrong, but you can bet it's kinda dangerous that people don't care at all if they can be surveilled. ",1525277554

"**Gaslighting**

Gaslighting is a form of manipulation that seeks to sow seeds of doubt in a targeted individual or in members of a targeted group, hoping to make them question their own memory, perception, and sanity. Using persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, and lying, it attempts to destabilize the target and delegitimize the target's belief.

Instances may range from the denial by an abuser that previous abusive incidents ever occurred up to the staging of bizarre events by the abuser with the intention of disorienting the victim. The term owes its origin to the 1938 Patrick Hamilton play Gas Light and its 1940 and 1944 film adaptations.

Stupid is a very emotive word and if you have fact and reason on your side as a result of the knowledge you have accrued, there's no excuse for belittling others who haven't learnt as much as you have.  It's like being a school bully taking the piss out of the 'stupid kid' in class who fell behind on her maths problems.

By virtue of us all being here discussing these issues, we are dealing with highly intelligent people.  Sadly, many in this space lack *emotional* intelligence and basic inter-personal skills. 

Whilst it may be fine to call a close friend you know well 'stupid' (with a wry smile and a wink) the impersonal nature of online communication means it's incumbent upon us when discussing highly contentious issues, that we do so courteously and with good grace (it's thought 55% of communication is body language, 38% is the tone of voice, and 7% is the actual words spoken).

In doing so, we often expand our own understanding of the complexity of the issues at, simply from hearing another viewpoint and forging allies on the other 'side' (even if we don't agree)... Clearly, since BCH supporters themselves are concerned by issues such as CSW's patent trolling, there is common ground between us all that calls for calm, rational dialogue.

The core group of Bitcoin aficionados that kickstarted all this didn't get this far by calling classical economists stupid (they are anything but).  Rather, we *all* got here by objectively weighing up arguments on both 'sides' and appealing to common sense and reason.

"The specific consensus agreement that garnered 90%+ hash power support for SegWit inclusion on the BTC block chain required a 2 MB block size limit increase, also known as the ""2x"" portion of the SegWit2x consensus agreement, at a very specific block height in the BTC block chain. That block height came and went, and the ""2x"" component was not added as was required by this consensus agreement due to a variety of factors (e.g. the BTC1 Garzik lead faction backing out just days or weeks before ""2x"" inclusion, and numerous ""bugs"" (perhaps intentionally left) in the BTC1 clients code.  

Since SegWit2x was the only consensus agreement to predict that it would have significantly more than 50%+ of miner hash rate support at activation time (it locked in at well over 90%+), it's the only SegWit proposal that was ever ""voted"" on live on mainnet via Nakamoto Consensus *and that received hash rate approval* (the pre-voting for SegWit1x languished between 30% and 35% of miner support for months, never topping 40%).

"&gt;This is going to be a long answer. It's going to go against most things this sub believe in.

Hey thanks for taking the time to respond! I don't shy away from views I may disagree with. 

&gt;First: I value the decentralized and uncensorable aspect of Bitcoin much more than the ""fast and cheap"". This means that decentralized and uncensorable may be worth to pay more for, if necessary.

Me too!

&gt;Try having that in mind as you read my answer.
&gt;
&gt;0-conf is a totally fine tradeoff, a bit faster for a bit less security. This is actually the same tradeoff that those taking credit cards today make, but I agree it's safer than credit cards. I have nothing against 0-conf. But it will still end up on-chain.

It's also the tradeoff you make when you use Bitcoin at all. People are waiting for many confirmations because each one lessens the chance that chain is replaced by a competing chain with a different version of events. The proof of security is just that this random walk is biased so there's overwhelming odds it's not replaced with enough confirmations. 

&gt;I believe the most important work we do today for scaling is to *limit* the growth of the blockchain. We're still early in cryptocurrency adoption. 

Do you mean the tech in general? Or the data structure itself

&gt; I still believe fast and cheap is a goal, but it doesn't *necessarily* have to be fast and cheap to end up on-chain. It would of course be nice if we could do it and still not go on accordance with the core properties of decentralized and uncensorable, but we can't. 

I might accept that as an argument if it happened from organic demand.

Instead a company claimed Gavin's github account had been hacked, and did not give back the private key of the repository once he proved it had not. 

Given his account wasn't hacked and this company and Gavin's interests do not align, it's very reasonable to state that the primary goal of their actions was obtaining the key and not altruism about the safety of the repository. 

This company then artifically made it slow and expensive by not allowing anyone to change the maximum block size once they had stolen the key. 

It's not ethical to support theft. Nor is this situation natural for bitcoin. When the blocks are not full it is both fast and cheap to make on chain transactions. 

&gt; I will explain: decentralized and uncensorable is not an absolute. It's a scale, from ""totally centrealized and totally censorable"", via ""a bit decentralized and not easily censorable"" to ""decentralized enough"" and ""almost impossible to censor"". I believe it's a goal to end up as close to the best end as possible.

I agree with this. The current monopoly on mining ASICs is not desirable but now that bitmain has shown how profitable the ASICs are, other companies will enter the market and this situation will improve. 

&gt;So, that said, Lightning isn't better than on-chain or zero conf per se, but it allows speed and price to be more unrelated to the price of on-chain transactions. I believe we have to accept the fact that on-chain has a cost to remain decentralized, which means we need to create layers on top that are fast and cheap. 

That cost again is currently very cheap once blockstream is not involved. Bitcoin Cash has shown this. You could argue it's because of the lower transaction volume but if you made BCHs blocks 1kB it would also be slow and expensive. BCH is only fast and cheap because it's not artificially constrained by unethical people. 

&gt; Lightning has extra security mechanisms, hash-time-lock contracts, that makes it safe to *not* submit transactions to the chain. I will not go in-depth in the safety mechanisms of LN itself here.
&gt;
&gt;Now, about the decentralized aspect:
&gt;
&gt;Larger block increases the cost of running a full node. A full node is a necessary component both for mining and for fully validating the chain. It's separate from mining - but here, I realize my view differ from this sub.

Only marginally, we are not storing 32 MB blocks today that's just the upper limit. Moores law cannot continue forever, no exponential can. It will hit a limit.

Not every user needs to run a validating node. It can be businesses who can afford to and have financial interest to rather than a poor farmer with bad Internet who just wants to make a tx.

It's still cheaper for a business to buy hard drives once than give visa 5% on every sale. 

Plus many people are unwittingly using the blocksteam chain from the code in the stolen repository, so BCH storage cost is extremely low right now. It will get higher as more people learn what happened, but it's much easier to keep up with organic growth

&gt; This is one of the crucial disagreements between BTC and BCH believers:
&gt;
&gt;A full node fully validates the chain. *Mining* puts a time-stamp on that validation, it's sort of a signature saying ""I validated *this set of transactions* at this time. But for it to be accepted, someone still need to validate your signature. And only full nodes do this fully. You can do it in a limited way with SPV nodes, and it's a tradeoff that's sensible to take for an individual, but the *total* security of the coin *do* indeed depend upon as many people as possible validating full blocks. And what can they do? They can say ""this isn't bitcoin!"" and drop the block! That's a crucial ability, and a key incentive for miners *not* to skip their job, and *not* change the properties of the coin in a whim.

I have no issues with what you said here, the timestamp server is described in the white paper. Those rules of what is bitcoin can't be set by one company who stole a github repo. They need to be set by the network. Bitcoin Unlimited doesn't mean unlimited block size, it's unlimited configuration. They want you to be able to set different parameters so performance bottlenecks can be identified. It just happens that when you artificially constrain block size it becomes the dominant bottleneck. 

&gt;
&gt;Remember why you're believing in cryptocurrencies as opposed to fiat, again? Yes, it's because we have central entities that in a whim can change the properties of the currency! The more people with the ability to say ""this is not bitcoin!"", the more we differ from fiat in that respect.
&gt;

So you support bitcoin being a consensus among many development teams? Come join the one that all non -blockstream teams joined :D

Blockstream is an unethical central authority who dictates the rules of your money

&gt;So: Making it more demanding to run full nodes will shift the incentives, it will lead to it being more expensive to run full nodes. Now, I happen to think that it'd *probably* be ok to double block size at this time, but it's by *no means* the most important work we do. I put more value in a coin that tries to solve the hard problems of remaining decentralized and uncensorable.
&gt;
&gt;So, I can now try to answer your question:
&gt;LN is not ""better than 0-conf and on-chain scaling"", it's a way to have fast and cheap while accepting the necessity to *limit* on-chain scaling.
&gt;
&gt;That said: LN in itself is pretty neat - but still a bit clunky. We're still early days, there's still a lot of quirks to be ironed out, but we *are* getting there.
&gt;

I dont think lightning will ever be fast without becoming centralized to a hub and spoke model. To have the onion routing, the paths through the network need to be planned by the tx sender. For this they use A*

Unfortunately A* has assumptions that it's the only agent planning a path. Multiple agents is a harder problem because the paths can't collide. If they do, the liquidity in the channel will be used up for one user and the tx will be reversed along the path until the user gets their money back. 

A*'s completeness guarantee (if a path exists it is guaranteed to find it) is only true if it has the full graph state. Otherwise it might not find the path. For example, it could not plan a path from London to Scotland with only a France map. It might happen to find one, but no guarantee. 

In lightning, the graph edges change weight with each tx. Tough for nodes to keep up with those state changes. 

Most multiple agent path planners are much weaker in guarantees than the single agent version. None that I know of have guarantees when the edges constantly change or where the agents only have partial knowledge. 

You know that error you get when it can't make a payment right now? That's A* failing. 

AMP helps a little because the path cost is lighter, but it's just hiding the problem that there's no completeness guarantee. 

Plus identifying which nodes should open a new channel to fix the routing is an even harder problem. 

It will be much easier with hub and spoke, there's only two channels which could cause the payment to fail so state updates are less. 

It would be really exciting if they develop an algorithm with a completeness guarantee for multiple agents on a graph that changes edges. It would literally revolutionize the field. That's a lot to hope for though. A revolutionary new algorithm might not even be mathematically possible. 

There's also the argument that anything lightning does will be faster and cheaper on BCH than the intentionally crippled version of Bitcoin. Time blockstream spends on lightning rather than Bitcoin only helps BCH.

I'm rather discouraged. I got a friend into crypto and told him about everything I know. Dyor etc and showed him how I research projects. Will I went to his house yesterday and asked how he was doing.. He showed me his portfolio and this guy is up like 300+% over about 3 weeks. I asked him what projects he was in and how he decided to get into them. He told me he lets will just randomly buy shit. While I'm over here dedicating a better part of my day (s) researching projects just to have anoob randomly pick projects and 3x his money in 3-4 weeks...,1525275438

I think it would be naive for anyone to say they wouldn't like to become rich from investing into bitcoin or other crypto, but with bitcoin being close to 10K for one coin, an individual in this generation would need hundreds of thousands of dollars at their disposal to buy enough bitcoin \(and hope it appreciates in value\) and make themselves rich quick.

BCH isn't a scam. Now was it started with best intentions maybe not. It is a legitimate coin just not on par of BTC. I agree they don't need to be calling BCH bitcoin because they clearly haven't won the right to the name (if you can even win a right to that). It's not pulling a fast one because it literally goes to the corresponding BTC wallet. BCH uses their own format for wallets now.

Story.  I tried splitting my BTC Private and BTC Diamond with the Electrum Wallet on GitHub without avail.  By inputting my old seeds.  No splitting of the coins. Nothing worked. Noting was working so I enlisted the help of developer Jimmy Song.  I gave him all my old seeds to work on splitting my forks.  

While he was splitting my old seeds I did something REALLY stupid and must have connected my ledger with my BTC into trying to split those coins with BTCPrivate and BTC Diamond into. That didn't seem to work.

Last night I went to bed and had all my BTC on my Ledger.

Woke up this morning and to check my Ledger Balance and ALL of it was gone. I am terrified. I don't know what to do. Please if anyone can help me get my coins back or trace them to the ultimate owner, I would be forever grateful. This is my life savings as I have previously liquidated all of my retirement to place into Bitcoin. Please I'm shaking uncontrollably and need help. Anyone? I'm terrified and about to throw up.

When did I say BCH stands for Bcash?    
I didn't.  
I said Bcash is a naturally easy way to shorten things down for the sake of  simplicity.  It's called an abbreviation.     
Just like T-notes and T-bonds are naturally easy ways to shorten Treasury Notes and Treasury Bonds.    
  

Bcash is not a slur. It's an abbreviation.  
The whole reason Ver cries about Bcash, like the little bitch that he is, is because the plan has always been to shorten Bitcoin Cash down to ""Bitcoin"" so he can confuse newbies who don't know any better.   
When the market shortened it to Bcash before he could slowly socially engineer the moronic masses, like yourself, into calling it Bitcoin he started throwing a soy boy hissy fit.

Just perfectly described the /btc sub, and the brigades shilling for Ver's scam BCH.  ",1525274636
"&gt; the fact that BTC is called Bitcoin on most exchanges.

BCH's biggest obstacle is that this is a gross understatement. BTC is called Bitcoin most everywhere in the world, and in every possible context. It really is BCH enthusiasts vs. the world here.

This naming debacle is virtually the same strategy the network used, only applied to the English language: fork it, effectively change one thing, then spend a whole lot of time and effort trying to explain to the world why they should come around to doing it that way.

The BCH community is incredibly visionary at times, but in my opinion failed to look ahead here. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. To most, ""BTC is not Bitcoin"" is an extraordinary claim, literally equivalent to saying ""Bitcoin is not Bitcoin"". BCH would have taken over already if it was merely exchanges saying and thinking this! There is a world of people who need convincing still.

Given this, the last thing a BCH evangelist should want to say is ""change my mind"". That's confusing which party needs to do the convincing. Only a BTC fan, already aware of the differences, would bother to try. Average Joe and Neutral Neil and Apathetic Andrew aren't going to step up to change your mind.

"In it's current state, XRP is somewhat centralized. This has advantages and disadvantages. Over time this centralized nature of XRP will vanish, when more third party validators join the network. Most people refer to BTC as completely decentralized. It is not. 

XRP does a lot of stuff in a way other cryptos can't seem to get right. Yes, XRP does have a company, Ripple, pushing the technology out there, but the ledger is not controlled fully by Ripple. They own (last time I checked) around 20% of the total nodes in the network. The other nodes have chosen to somewhat follow Ripple's choices, but for the time being, there has not been much conflict on this matter.

Bitcoin was the first crypto, and will always keep some value because of that. It's also used as base trading pair for most exchanges, making it the most traded and well known. It does have something to it, making it a form of digital gold, and I could see that happening. That said, BTC does have higher fees, and slower transaction times than a lot of other available coins.

I feel like every time I try to defend XRP I get stamped with ""XRP holder"" and ""XRP Fanboy"". Yes, I have some XRP. Yes, I have some BTC. Yes, I have some ETH (and a ton of altcoins I don't want to mention for shilling purposes). Am I doing something wrong? Should I just stick to one coin and protect it no matter what?

We are calling the ticker BTC chain Bitcoin BTC, Bitcoin SL or Bitcoin ""Core"", not the other way around if we're being pedantic here. It's a name derived from the client.

&gt;You can say that Bitcoin ABC is a fork of Bitcoin Core

That's a different subject. The client Bitcoin ABC certainly forked from the client Bitcoin Core. Are we talking about clients now? Because all I'm saying is that Bitcoin Core is a common, benevolent, fitting, nickname, for the SegWit+Legacy chain that uses ticker BTC.

"Usually I use Bitcoin (Cash) when implying that a statement applies to both - in this case I ommitted because the essence of determining the fee is still the same in both (although there have been suggestions in the past to make the fee determined in other ways).

Yes, there are some on this sub who refer to Bitcoin Cash simply as Bitcoin - it can be ambiguous and one needs to pay attention to the context - or ask like you did.

The whole debate about names is very contentious at the moment. My view is plain 'Bitcoin' no longer exists, since it split into two competing coins which share the same historical ledger and the same hashpower. BTC also underwent a (soft) fork when it activated Segwit (after the BCH fork happened).

A lot of us feel that Segwit is a step too far removed from the original design, carrying with it a multitude of decisions which we don't see as healthy for Bitcoin. So for us, Bitcoin was what existed before Bitcoin Cash and then Bitcoin (Segwit?) split up.

Others, like Jimmy Song, argue that any coin that hard forks off from Bitcoin is automatically an altcoin. But Bitcoin itself underwent a hardfork in May 2013, and would therefore now be considered an altcoin, the same way that Bitcoin Cash is viewed by them as an altcoin. It's hard to find a consistent viewpoint on this :-)",1525274236

@bitcoin was created a long time ago by someone who lurked and re-activated as a bch user recently. 

/r/btc (if there is now any group that can be said to ""represent"" bitcoin cash) was very ""meh"" towards the mutual agreed upon x2 fork after core showed such blatant disregard for the AGREED UPON compromise ""segwit first, 2mb blocks later"". This was because \r\bitcoin, core developers and blockstream renegaded on the MUTALLY AGREED UPON compromise.

There are no ""fake"" bitcoin wallets being promoted, they are all just as real as any wallet. As long as you consider bitcoin cash to  be bitcoin. Most of them, including the one from https://www.bitcoin.com, lets you use any one of them. You have to be a true retard to be able to confuse the two different currencies inside it. Have you even tried it?

"Nobody has given a thorough answer, so I’ll try:

If there were zero fees, you could simply send millions of transactions back and forth for free and ddos the network. One of the guiding principles of bitcoin has always been that you should be able to run a full node on cheap hardware, and that many transactions would make this impossible. BCH has moved away from this somewhat, saying that as long as enough merchants and power users are running a node, that’s enough. 

The other reason is to incentivize miners to continue to secure the network. At the moment, the mining reward is much higher than the fee reward, but over the next couple of decades that will flip as the reward keeps halving. 

There’s no coin that truly has no fees. They either obfuscate it with inflation ( your transactions appear free, but the supply is inflating and going to validating nodes, paying the nodes) or in cases like nano, the fees are hidden in electricity costs on your wallet, ie small proof of work to send a tx to prevent spam.

Whataboutism (also known as whataboutery) is a variant of the tu quoque logical fallacy that attempts to discredit an opponent's position by charging them with hypocrisy without directly refuting or disproving their argument, which is particularly associated with Soviet and Russian propaganda. When criticisms were leveled at the Soviet Union during the Cold War, the Soviet response would be ""What about..."" followed by an event in the Western world.

The term ""whataboutery"" has been used in Britain and Ireland since the period of the Troubles (conflict) in Northern Ireland. Lexicographers date the first appearance of the variant whataboutism to the 1990s or 1970s, while other historians state that during the Cold War Western officials referred to the Soviet propaganda strategy by that term.

Milton Friedman (; July 31, 1912 – November 16, 2006) was an American economist who received the 1976 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his research on consumption analysis, monetary history and theory, and the complexity of stabilization policy. With George Stigler and others, Friedman was among the intellectual leaders of the second generation of Chicago price theory, a methodological movement at the University of Chicago's Department of Economics, Law School, and Graduate School of Business from the 1940s onward. Several students and young professors that were recruited or mentored by Friedman at Chicago went on to become leading economists; they include Gary Becker, Robert Fogel, Thomas Sowell, and Robert Lucas Jr.

Friedman's challenges to what he later called ""naive Keynesian"" theory began with his 1950s reinterpretation of the consumption function.

"Because now is a worse ICO state than in previous history. It's simply way too easy for people to create some ERC20 and write a whitepaper and market that shit and pump it. 


Whereas it used to be that altcoins actually had to create their own chain, by coding themselves, or by forking. 



___ 


So you have this immense explosion of shitcoins, which are not controlled by anything. People claim shit about some shitcoin, let it be ERC20 forever and pump it and eventually dump it. 


Altcoins are not a new thing. Here's something interesting. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20150906/

Whilst you recognize that some players still exist, the majority has fallen into shitness. 


And sicne back in these days people had to actually work to create a coin, you could argue that they immediately had more value, as they weren't an ERC20. 


Now any shitter can create a coin, thanks to ERC20. 



It's thanks to ERC20, that you see projects like EOS, have a 15 billion valuation, without having a chain at all. 15 billion dollar testnet is what EOS is. 


And EOS isn't even the worst example. 



I also suspect, without being a maximalist and having Altcoins myself, that a flushening of Shitcoins must eventually happen. 


Eventually Shitcoins will dump, because that's what most of them did in the history of Crypto and people lose their money in crazy fashion never seen before. Maybe then Bitcoin becomes more interesting again, as Bitcoin is not a scam. 



I'm not even talking about established main players in the field. Not talking about Ethereum for instance nor do I talk about Litecoin, Monero, good projects really. 



But you have shit like EOS, TRON, Vechain, Verge, those are top 20 coins, which are absolute hype projects, if not scams. 


Then you have Bcash, pretty much a marketing coin that tries to trap people into a centralized version of Bitcoin, which will only ever scale in linear fashion, that project has 20 billion attached to it. 



I'm not even going to bother to mention all the other shitcoins beyond top 30.

There is innovation, yes. Some projects will be successful, yes. But a good portion will simply not deliver. Just because some human claims that their new Blockchain or DAG will innovate blockchain space, that doesn't mean it actually does. 


Careful with the Shitcoins is what I'm saying. ",1525273307

"The question, and perhaps the approach for the solution in the paper is indeed important and interesting. Unfortunately, I think that there are serious downsides to the construction.

My main criticism is the following: it uses a concept which the author calls ""shards"". You should think of shards as quantum money state which can be verified by anyone \(but can be forged by the creator who ""mined"" this shard\). Several shards, together, form a ""qubitcoin"". We will call these set of shards ""meged"" shards. The assumption is that each miner would only create one shard, sell it in the open market, and other agents, which we will call ""mergers"" will ""merge"" shards together to create a qubit\-coin. The first problem is the following: there's nothing stopping a miner from  creating many shards, and sell them all in the open market, to several, innocent ""mergers"". This is a problem in an open system like Bitcoin, which does not rely on trust.  In other words, to the very least, one has to establish trust between the miners and the mergers for this construction to work. This provides an advantage to well established miners, which may lead to centralization. ",1525271994

My argument for XLM being a security is mainly the fact that you can, by simply having a ton of XLM, generate more XLM. So the more the network is used, the more XLM will you in theory generate. This could be compared to the way dividends work if you have stocks. 

Ripple did create XRP, and wants to improve on it, making it the global standard in crypto. That said, if Ripple goes away, the XRP Ledger would still function the same way it does today. Banks can still use it for cross-border transfers the same way they do today. 

You're not providing anything to the discussion, just saying I'm wrong. Come with some solid arguments why XLM is not a security and we can have a civil discussion instead of starting to attack eachother. No need to get personally offended over an investment (or discussion of an investment), and if you do, you might want to take a few steps back and reconsider your values.

"I gave this a shot with a 1-10 scale.

Quality | Gold | USD (cash) | Bitcoin 
:-- | :--: | :--: | :--:
Fungible (one unit is equivalent to any other unit) |10 |9 |7 
Non-consumable (wear and tear/ loss when used and over time) |8 |6 |8 
Portlable (ease of carrying $100M) |2 |5 |9 
Durable (long-term storage and wear and tear if not used) |10 |7 |10 
Divisible |9 |2 |8 
Predictible supply and value |7 |9 |0 
Secure (easy to tell if counterfit) |9 |5 |10
Transactable (can you trade it without relying on anything else) |10 |10 |3 
Sovereign (Government Issued) |No |Yes |No

Reasoning for some items:

Fungability: bitcoin can be traced and blacklisted. Cash potentially could be as well, gold cannot.

Non-consumable: Chemicals can reach gold, money is paper and wears out, Bitcoin has fees and has potential to be sent to the wrong address with no way of recovering it.

Divisible: with accurate enough equipment, gold is near infinitely divisible - even if it would be hard to tell in small quantities. USD go down to cents in physical form and Bitcoin is limited to 1 Satoshi (though a fork could add additional decimals if needed)

Transactable: without internet and power, you have no idea if if you are really getting any amount Bitcoin",1525271168

Bitcoin does not equal coinbase. It would be a large suck on the market value but Bitcoin is antifragile for these scenarios. If you are particularly worried about your Bitcoin it is recommended you learned how to manage your own private keys whether you decide to go with a paper wallet or a cell phone app Wallet or even a PC wallet you may even run your own full node. These are all options for maintaining control of your Bitcoin and all come with their own learning curve,1525271112
"Regarding the lighting network \- no.

Regarding Bitcoin: public quantum money is a \(centralized\) protocol. This protocol allows a \(trusted!\) mint to create quantum money states. \(This is not yet relevant for a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin, since the mint must be trusted. \)

Each quantum money state can be verified by anyone, and cannot be forged by any malicious party \(other than the mint\), under some computational assumptions. This is much better than the cash we use today \(there is no \*fundamental\* reason why a $100 cannot be forged\). The main candidates are Aaronson\-Christiano called quantum money from hidden subspaces scheme [https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.4740](https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.4740) \(which was partially broken [https://hal.inria.fr/hal\-01098223/document](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01098223/document) , fully broken as reported in [https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09047](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09047) , a proposed solution was suggested the previous link, and a full security proof based on quantum\-secure indistguishability\-obfuscation \(IO\) in [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.02276.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.02276.pdf) . It is worth pointing out that there is no candidate construction for quantum\-secure IO, so this is still only hypothetical\), and  Farhi et al., called quantum money from knots [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1004.5127.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1004.5127.pdf) , which relies on beautiful knot theory, but lacks a security proof.

There are several other constructions and several other variants of quantum money \(most notably, private quantum money, in which only the mint can verify the money state, and therefore must take part in every transaction. The main advantage here is that it can be shown to be unconditionally secure, i.e. without any computational assumptions\). ",1525271090

"Fees provide an incentive to maintain the network and protect against corruption. Nano uses DPOS which is not a trust-less system. Fees are not always bad.

"Another cryptocurrency that is growing right now is BERRY, from Rentberry.com.  They're one of the best ICO's of 2018, here's why:

- Rentberry raised $30,000,000 in their ICO, and $4,000,000 prior to that from investors. This put them as one of the most highly desired and widely adopted ICO’s of 2018 to-date.

- The quality of the Rentberry core team is exceptional compared with a vast majority of other blockchain projects: Their CEO comes from a background of working at Cisco, Deloitte and several investment firms. Prior to this, he led a team that launched and successfully exited another tech startup before Rentberry. Their CTO holds a degree from Stanford in Management Science and Engineering, and has previously worked as an engineer for industry leaders such as Altera and Amazon Music. The rest of their team are roughly 40-strong, and many of which have worked together on projects for a number of years.

- Rentberry has a vibrant and engaged community of participants and supporters - from their 28,000 Twitter followers, to the 15,000+ followers on their Telegram channel.

- Much innovation is built directly into the Rentberry platform - one of the major reasons for the project garnering as much attention as they have. Blockchain tech will allow for high levels of transparency and accountability throughout the life cycles of every tenancy. During the application process, immutable records of all previous interactions of both the renter and landlord will be provided for each and an algorithmic-bidding system will be used by tenants to place bids on properties which they would like to lease.

- One of the core features of the Rentberry platform will be the ability for BERRY token holders to collectively crowdfund the security deposits of tenants - allowing for renters to secure properties without such a high barrier to entry, and earning a passive income of roughly 7% for the lending token holders in the process.

- Rentberry is a respected leader within the blockchain industry - gaining significant media exposure prior to their token offering, and being one of a minority of crypto-startups to launch their ICO with a pre-established platform in place. The Rentberry web app has been live for the past 3 years - and the tech being built into their service only enhances the functionality that already exists.

- Rentberry are expanding internationally late in 2018, and will be offering global users the opportunity to leverage a range of innovative features when renting and leasing properties.

- After being caught up in the months-long bear market at the beginning of 2018, many ICO’s participants watched as the value of BERRY moved lower with the rest of the market. 

- A significant majority of those holding BERRY tokens today participated at roughly $0.33 during the ICO, and are avid supporters of the vision and future roadmap of the Rentberry Team. With such support, and after seeing much of the rest of the industry recover in recent weeks, BERRY could likely see a return to their ICO price and higher - meaning about a 5x increase in value compared to today’s price.

- A number of highly anticipated announcements are just over the horizon at Rentberry, including partnership announcements, feature additions to their platform and the completion and launch of their mobile app in the coming months. For updates and direct access to announcements as they are made, one of the admin team on their Telegram channel will be able to direct you to their community announcement page.

- And last but not least, unlike a number of crypto-projects that are here to raise what they can at ICO and then slip into obscurity, along with the hopes and dreams of their participants, the team behind Rentberry have a long-standing and proven track record, and continuously reiterate the importance they place in building quality and value into their platform.

When you remove those properties from a blockchain project, then sure, you may technically still have a blockchain and you may be doing some fancy things with hashing algorithms to provide you with easy validation, but those problems had already been solved. You could easily implement a private blockchain backed by an SQL database, and yes, it has some good properties for some very small use cases, but that's not the reason I fell in love with blockchain.

"Given that almost everybody involved in crypto is investing in projects, rather than accumulating coins for future use, we all seek profit. That means that we want to buy a coin as cheap as possible and sell it as expensive as possible, and try to estimate the growth potential vs. risk for each investment. For most coins and tokens a lot of the current value is based on speculation and the promise of huge demand for the coin once mass adoption is achieved. For coins with a relative low value, the growth potential is huge, but usually the risk is huge as well. For coins with a relative high value, the risk should be lower. Given that EOS is placed in the top 5 of CMC without having a real product released, one could argue that it is overvalued. There is still a risk that the mainnet will never be launched, or that it does not perform as expected. Each investor will need to make his or her own estimate whether that risk is acceptable and worth the potential gains.

"I like Bitcoin.

I'd like Bitcoin more if the community surrounding it wasn't hostile to other crypto.

I'd like Bitcoin even more if the people that are actively maintaining it were open to suggestion and respected the developer-consumer relationship, instead of treating Bitcoin as their personal playground for pet projects and stifling other use cases.

I like Bitcoin Cash more because of these things. But I don't hate Bitcoin. I simply can't use a coin that's being engineered to *not* have room for my activity. And that's where my opinion of BTC ends; but that's not where the story ends.

You see, BTC supporters don't have a similar feeling. They paint BCH as an ""attack"" and ""an attempt to steal the Bitcoin name"" and ""intentionally confusing newcomers"". They claim BCH is fraudulent and levy **personal attacks** against BCH developers, proponents, and users such as myself. These attacks are not as tame as name-calling; they can extend into the real world, having such dire consequences as account locking and law enforcement intervention.

BCH has no such army of miscreants. So when you use the phrase ""without everyone talking shit"", I immediately ask, ""who's the everyone? BCH supporters don't do this"". I have personally suffered on account of BTC-supporter behavior already. I would not have any shit to talk, were my accounts not attacked. I would not have any shit to talk, were my opinions not censored from multiple forums. I would not have any shit to talk, if I never had the experience of being shat upon to speak of in the first place. I have no interest in talking shit, but this situation has brought itself to me and I cannot be honest without talking shit.

So I am talking shit - honest shit - shit that was flung at me personally from BTC supporters and proponents on account of my opposition to the BTC ""road map"" and subsequent support of BCH - because that is *all there is to say* about BTC.",1525269963

"Bitcoin Cash is a great cryptocurrency, nice write-up!  Another great cryptocurrency to keep an eye on is Rentberry.com's BERRY token.  This is why:

- Rentberry raised $30,000,000 in their ICO, and $4,000,000 prior to that from investors. This put them as one of the most highly desired and widely adopted ICO’s of 2018 to-date.

- The quality of the Rentberry core team is exceptional compared with a vast majority of other blockchain projects: Their CEO comes from a background of working at Cisco, Deloitte and several investment firms. Prior to this, he led a team that launched and successfully exited another tech startup before Rentberry. Their CTO holds a degree from Stanford in Management Science and Engineering, and has previously worked as an engineer for industry leaders such as Altera and Amazon Music. The rest of their team are roughly 40-strong, and many of which have worked together on projects for a number of years.

- Rentberry has a vibrant and engaged community of participants and supporters - from their 28,000 Twitter followers, to the 15,000+ followers on their Telegram channel: https://t/me/rentberry/

- Much innovation is built directly into the Rentberry platform - one of the major reasons for the project garnering as much attention as they have. Blockchain tech will allow for high levels of transparency and accountability throughout the life cycles of every tenancy. During the application process, immutable records of all previous interactions of both the renter and landlord will be provided for each and an algorithmic-bidding system will be used by tenants to place bids on properties which they would like to lease.

"You, like everyone else, seem to miss the entire point. 

This is a fork. Every fork of bitcoin is a viable contender for the ***original***. That’s why forks happen. 

You use forks for a reason. Did you know that? The reason for a fork is that a significant quantity of the participants are unhappy with what happened to the ***original*** dev team. The entire purpose... the entire point.... the entire reason for forks… is to reroute the ***original*** down another path.

This is not about what name you want to give it. What name I want to give it. What name it “should or shouldn’t“ be. 

It’s a fork.  It’s name is bitcoin.  While the Market is deciding which one wins, it’s natural to give the fork a differentiating name. But there’s no debate. If the market decides for BCH, BCH is bitcoin. Therefore it makes absolute rational sense to start calling the ***other*** implementation by its specific name as well.

"EOS will always be constrained as it tries to put everything on a single blockchain, but then again it has no alternatives as EOS would not know how to secure the entire network by other means. With proper utilisation of cloud computing aka elastic computing it would even be possible to have high performance on low performance machines as the computing aspect takes place elsewhere which would imply only the input is necessary on any machine. Elastos is a real network operating system that provides the security the internet never has had, but should have had. As a result it can ensure protection against DDOS attacks, malware, viruses, man-in-the-middle attacks. That in itself would be revolutionary to provide such protection and is the reason why for example SAIC Motors (China's largest automaker works with Elastos on self driving cars as only it can ensure these cars cannot be hacked). In short it can provide the network for critical infrastructure of all kinds, especially involving financial and logistics. It furthermore provides for a secure environment for the internet of things. Applications do not have network access with Elastos and this means is that for example a webcam cannot spy on you regardless of whether other parties would like to use it that way. Elastos further allows for digital items to be made scarce and tradable. If you buy a digital item, you currently cannot resell it, but with Elastos digital items sold again (for different prices) and thus allows for items such as games, books, movies to be created in limited quantities and sold and resold as its owners desire. As such a significant part of piracy problems can be solved this way. IP addresses do not exist on Elastos....there will be no websites that mimic other websites (like is commonly the case in crypto). Even the great firewall of China will not be able to stop Elastos. It can go through anything with perfect end to end security. It is a cloud operating system that can run on phones, computers, tablets and all other kinds of IoT devices and can also run on top of existing operating systems. To secure the network Elastos relies on merged mining with Bitcoin to give it the greatest security possible, but it uses a flexible sidechain structure that can run any consensus mechanism possible for dApps. This is the reason why for example Zapya is using it with its new product called Viewchain and its already existing userbase of 500 million people.....enough to run practically all other blockchains into the ground with that kind of userbases. It is the most complex product out there by far with a development time that dwarfs every other project, so it probably will take a lot of time to understand it.

Sure! After all, it's not a technical reason at all.

Bitcoin Cash is the closest to such a thing, so other coin communities relentlessly attack it and its supporters.

"The real question is what do you want from your cryptocurrency. What is the most important thing to you?

Bitcoin supporters value a few things above everything else: *Decentralization* (the Bitcoin network has to be as distributed as possible, live on as many machines as possible)  and *Trustlessness* (you can enter the system without trusting anyone, and you will end up in the correct final state). There are a few more, but let's stick with these.

To achieve these two tasks is not easy. For instance, if you only have, say, 100 server farms globally processing your transactions, this is hardly decentralized - There's many more banks in the world today, and not very many would claim the banking system is decentralized! This also affects trustlessness - If you need to rely on one of these huge farms to feed you correct data about transactions and so on, this is not a trustless system in any sense of the word. 

The price to pay for sustainable *decentralization* and *trustlessness*, i.e. for a system that has these two properties in 50+yrs from now, are high **on chain** fees.

Read that for yourself and get to your own conclusions. (Feel free to ask questions or let me know why you disagree.) 

So from the perspective of Bitcoin supporters Bitcoin Cash ""is no good"" because it leads to a system where very few players run the show - Miners and giant server farms. This is simply not acceptable for Bitcoin supporters.

On the other hand, if you have no problem with a system like this, there's nothing wrong with BCH. You use your own ""light wallet"" (SPV) for transactions and rely on miners to feed you all the data. That's not too different from going to an ATM and getting out cash, with the advantage it can be (relatively) easily deployed across borders, globally.

&amp;nbsp;

So it's really up to you to decide ""Why is Bitcoin Cash so bad"". Think about what you want from your crypto, and that will tell you which coin you'll end up supporting... might be neither Bitcoin nor Bitcoin Cash! (Monero is great for privacy, Litecoin is another possible choice, ...)

BTC does currently serve a purpose as you describe but my issue is that it has not arrived here by strategy or intent. It is simply in the position it is in because of legacy and brand recognition.  It's utility or lack of it are key to being anywhere in the eco system in 2-3 years.  A store of value with no utility will soon become declining value.,1525267679

"Get your facts straight.

FED = The Federal Reserve = The Federal Reserve System, containing, among others, of 12 Federal Reserve banks, amongst which one of them (St. Louis) now said Bitcoin is a currceny. ""The FED"" is shillingly wrong.

""but openly admits that there is no “intrinsic value” to USD or any state sponsored currency.""
Has anyone ever argued, that the intrinsic value of dollar is &gt;0? Since decoupling of gold, it is blatantly obvious that there's no intrinsic value of 2 grams of wool and linen. And even the coupling of dollar to gold is extrinsic. If you take the gold away, the value of dollar is 0 again. How's that intrinsic?

As /u/Thefriendlyfaceplant obviously showed, mining is no intrinsic, but extrinsic value of bitcoin. It takes resources from _outside_ the bitcoin world, processes it and puts it into bitcoin. If that's not the definition of extrinsic, I don't know what is.
""I don’t think we should ban it — the green bills in your pocket don’t have an intrinsic value, either. The value is based on what others think is its value. That’s true of any currency."" - Sheila Bair, former FDIC chair from 2006 to 2011.

Intrisinc value does not come from the relationship of supply and demand or from a finiteness of the resource. We started to value scarce things not based on their practicability, but on its possibility to show value to others. Earlier days was probalby ""it's shiny, that's expensive"".
 Intrinsic value is a vocabulary from financial analysis, where it refers to _fair value_ and that's the only case it should be used. Fair valuation on a free market based on societal ascription is not rational, hence why cornering the silver market with x25 prices was possible. Fair valuation changed as the sentiment changed, as societal ascription of value changed.

If you think a little physophically, you'll quickly see that nothing except for food and water actually has intrinsic value: It keeps us alive. That's no $ amount of intrinsic value, though.
 All the rest, from clothes to gold, has extrinsic value from societal ascription or from processing different resources into a new object e.g. as a form of exhibiting wealth or producing something.

This whole discussion is so utterly unimportant.",1525267574

"I never took any offense to ""bcash"" if used as an _informal nickname without malicious intent_. It's just that it's been used as a smear term in divertion and spam campaigns, to isolate Bitcoin Cash from it's full name, and is actually rather the name for several previously existing projects such as a Brazilian payments company. Hence no longer very useful and hardly if ever used by anyone actually supportive of Bitcoin BCH.

The name ""Core"" taken from the official client is a so called differentiator, used because of the split that happened previous to full SegWit implementation. It lets us know which of [the two (old video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=605&amp;v=IRbgZUGHn9g) competing/complementing chains that originated from the old Bitcoin chain that we are actually talking about.

All of those other forks that you bring up are simply distractions. They were either scam projects, or jokes that were deliberately created to take away credibility from the Cash chain.

I'm not interested in talking about Ver. But Bitcoin ""Cash"" was called ""a Bitcoin"" employing ""a Bitcoin network"" and aiming to become ""the defacto Bitcoin"" from day one. Cash was simply added to the end to avoid having to name it ""B""(get the picture now?) or ""2"" or something similar.

BitcoinABC could not be used as a powerful enough differentiator in the first place, because it wasn't the only developer team building a client for Bitcoin BCH nor is there an official client for it at all.

But businesses cannot just switch to BCH and call it Bitcoin, it just cannot be done. The reason is because they would **all** have to agree to the change, and they don't. Lacking a nearly universal consensus, businesses are liable to face damage claims if customers send Bitcoin buy the business is expecting Bitcoin Cash.

Bitcoin Core is an implementation of bitcoin.

For this reason, it is also known as the Satoshi client. As of 2018, Bitcoin Core repositories are maintained by a team of maintainers, with Wladimir J. van der Laan leading the release process.

**Bitcoin**

Bitcoin (₿) is a cryptocurrency and worldwide payment system. It is the first decentralized digital currency, as the system works without a central bank or single administrator. The network is peer-to-peer and transactions take place between users directly, without an intermediary. These transactions are verified by network nodes through the use of cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain.

The trolls tried to remove Bitcoin from the name to paint BCH as an altcoin, but it's gained enough traction under the name Bitcoin Cash that it seems crazy to me to call it anything else, especially when you consider that most exchanges list it under that name. The last thing anyone wants is for people to accidentally buy BTC when they wanted BCH (or vice versa).

I'm all for promoting the underhanded methods of /r\/Bitcoin and Blockstream, so I'd argue that a more fitting name for BTC would be ""Bitcoin (SegWit)"" to remove the argument of ""It's just the reference client bruh!"" and to remain clear in the fact that BTC is called Bitcoin on most exchanges.

Lastly, don't sweat the name too much. It's the philosophy that's important and that's alive and well in Bitcoin Cash (thanks in large part to people like you and others in this community).

"&gt; We will have a billion people using Bitcoin in a few years. This will mean each person can make 1 transaction approximately every 5 days. To enable such levels of transaction, each full node runner will need to allocate 16TB of data per year.

Bitcoin didn't need to scale to a billion people overnight. Back when we first began hitting the block limit, we didn't even need 8Mb. 2Mb would have massively alleviated fee pressure &amp; given second layer solutions time to develop &amp; mature. Any second layer solution will require a blocksize increase anyway, so why not just get that increase over with now so that the coin isn't hampered in the meantime before those technologies are ready?

And regardless, the actual technical issues are a really on the side anyway. The main concern should be how it has been shown that the community is extremely vulnerable to a certain form of extremely dangerous centralization - developer centralization. By controlling major communications channels (/r/bitcoin, bitcointalk.org, bitcoin.org) and employing developers, a banker sponsored group has been able to politically coopt the entire Bitcoin movement.

"15: Now I'd like to get back to a more general topic. I honestly think it's a clear sing of stupidity to fall for the old, typical, standard, obvious trick of populist conspiracy theories! These theories are all very similar, &amp; they all basically go like this: ""the world would be perfect, everything would come for free, w/o any scarcity, any sacrifice, any trade-offs...if not for an evil minority who creates ARTIFICIAL scarcity ù6 trade-offs, all to get some power over us with extremely complex &amp; not well defined machinations!"". I think only stupid people falls for this kind of cheap rhetoric, but don't get me wrong: that's a lot of people! Most persons are more stupid than the average person, &amp; the average person is indeed very stupid! That's why populist myths are widely used by politicians.

16: While populist conspiracy theories are stupid in and of themselves (15), the particular one used in the ""Bitcoin scalability"" circus is an astonishingly idiotic variation around the basic plot. I really thing only very stupid people could fall for something like this (5). In this case the explanation of the conspiracy is more cumbersome than usual. To begin w/, basically all the cypherpunks that pioneered the discovery of Bitcoin (Back, Szabo, Todd, Finney) inexplicably do agree on the existence of the ""artificial"" trade-off/scarcity. Weird! Then some of those pioneers are even recruited by the usual conspiracy villains (Bilderberg/Rothschild/Whatever) to create a company, Blockstream, committed to destroy Bitcoin through conservation/promotion of the ""artificial"", fake limitations/trade-offs. Wow, much evil! There isn't a very clear explanation of the exact motivation behind the Bilderberg/Rothschild/Whatever evil plan...probably they're just afraid of Bitcoin since they ""control all the banks"" (Duh!). Don't tell anybody but...I think they may even be JEWS!!! Spooky!!! Since dumb conspiracy theories don't have to be consistent, this goal is confused w/ another one, aslo very typical: PROFIT!!! Sooo evil! Apparently, Blockstream ""will make money w/ commercial sidechains, because people will use the Lightning Network due to small blocks!"". Ok, LN isn't really a commercial Sidechain, but an open, permissionless layer on top of Bitcoin, characterized by negligible-to-inexistent fees, developed by many independent company/developers &amp; run by thousands of independent, competing parties. But who cares, right?

17: On logical ground only, we can already say this particular flavour of populist conspiracy theory (16) is so stupid that only very stupid people would fall for it. But it's also based on many factual lies, all actually very easy to debunk: ie the number of Bitcoin Core developers employed by Blockstream, the number of Bitcoin Core developers NOT employed by Blockstream, Lightning Network developers employed by Blockstream, the number of Lightning Network developers NOT employed by Blockstream, and so on. There are also a lot of economical/political misconceptions (about ""censorship"", for example), typically used to promote this idiotic conspiracy theory. I tried to list some of them in this talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwW7XZCKPU …. Only very stupid people would believe this stuff.

18: Simple heuristics aren't just useful to be skeptical about non-sensical conspiracy theories, but also (&amp; especially) to beware clear, obvious, blatant fraudsters/liars. So, the ""big block"" field is now mostly lead/sponsored/pushed by: Craig S. Right, Jihan Wu, Roger Ver. The first is a confirmed con-artist, who tried to impersonate Satoshi Nakamoto w/ false (delirious) claims, fake digital signature, fake pre-dated blogposts &amp; PGP keys. Every single con attempt was publicly debunked. Purpose? Visibility, but also patent-trolling vs Bitcoin. The second is an Asic monopolist (I actually hope not for long), connected w/ the Chinese government, who is playing since years an obvious monopoly troll-game against Bitcoin, completed w/ kill-switches, backdoors &amp; covert optimisations built on stuff sold to other people. The third is a pathological, narcissistic liar, who was caught lying about not using sock-puppets &amp; who spent the last month spreading fake news &amp; FUD vs Bitcoin &amp; using his online channels to defraud newbies, selling them Bcash while they where looking for Bitcoin. There're actually other, embarrassing minor characters in that pathetic circus, one more ethically questionable than the other, from the ""bamboozled"" disgraced former developer Gavin Andresen (who supported the CSW fraud), to academic-plagiarism-hero Emin Gun Sirer, etc. Only someone extremely stupid would think this kind of brigade could really replace Bitcoin as the new private, censorship-resistant, global, sustainable, digital gold standard. To think that Bitcoin could be replaced by an altcoin, for whatever reason, is generally stupid. Even if Bitcoin was really doomed by some convoluted conspiracy (16), any attempt to replace it would fail (6). But EVEN IF one really went down this road, literally ANY other altcoin (maybe ""big-fast-blocks"" LTC?) would have more chances than the embarrassing scam Bcash!

19: For all these reasons, I think you're either stupid or malicious. I hope you don't take this as a personal offence. I don't think stupidity is ""genetic"": I think it's mostly a choice, some kind of intellectual dishonesty/laziness. People can stop being stupid. You should.",1525264230
"I am no /u/kanzure but I'll give this a shot:

Ok, here I am. I'll write down some bullet-points. This isn't a rebuttal of your article (no time for that, at least not now): it's just my own list of arguments about what specifically I think makes you, and every other bcasher who isn't intentionally malicious, stupid.

1: Bitcoin is one of the greatest financial opportunities in human history. If anyone interested in wealth &amp; misses it/fucks up w/ it, qualifies as stupid. I get from your other tweets that you're not interested in wealth (I am), so at least this point doesn't really concern you.
2: Bitcoin is one of the greatest opportunities for the advancement of personal freedom in human history. I think whoever qualifies as a ""libertarian"" in the anglo-saxon ""free market"" tradition (I guess this is the case for you) &amp; misses it/fucks up w/ it, qualifies as stupid.

3: When I say ""misses it/fuck up w/ it"" (1,2) I mean, in a crescendo of stupidity level: 

1. privately dismissing it, publicly dismissing it advising others to do the same
2. publicly &amp; actively attacking it
3. going down in history as an enemy of Bitcoin (zenith of stupidity).

4: Bitcoin is a complex topic: I don't think who don't understand it fully qualifies as stupid just for that, but who, w/o understanding it, voices very strong/controversial opinions about it, taking extreme stances under the effect of his own cognitive dissonance, does qualify.

5: Since Bitcoin is complex (4), I don't think everybody should/could come to understand it deeply, subtile trade-offs included, but I think everybody who isn't stupid can easily use basic heuristics to distinguish/compare other people's expertise, skills, integrity, honesty. Thus, even w/o discussing his ability to master this complex topic directly, whoever systematically, continuously &amp; exclusively conflates experts w/ solid arguments with obvious/blatant scammers, fraudsters, con-men, manipulators &amp; compromised/bad fully qualifies as stupid.

6: Slight change of topic (it will make sense later on): I think I understand Bitcoin enough to say it's very likely an unrepeatable experiment. Altcoins, even if they weren't the scammy, clumsy, useless, inferior Bitcoin clones they all are, are inherently stupid, because:

1. their success would undermine the only thing that make the ""digital gold scarcity"" value proposition possible (focal point around the original issuance)
2. they can't replicate Bitcoin's ""immaculate conception"", they're compromised since day 0, by definition.

So, I think that, while the Bitcoin experiment COULD very well still fail (even if I think &amp; hope w/ all my heart it will succede), altcoins couldn't possible win. I think it's very stupid to bet on the altcoin-takeover or (even worse) on the multicoin-coexistence scenarios.

7: Another slight change of topic: it's obvious to me there is a fundamental problem w/ a global-state network designed in such a way that it will FOREVER require EVERY single node to get &amp; process EVERY single past &amp; present state change. I think only a stupid would disagree. Luckily, I don't think Bitcoin as a whole is doomed to be such a system (even if we could say it has been for a while). There're are several techniques, some already imagined by Satoshi &amp; even by his predecessors, that could at least mitigate this (obvious) inherent problem:

* trusted 3rd parties for little/fast txs, where counterparty risk is minimised anyway, + on-chain settlement (Finney),
* trustless nSequence-based payment channels, + on-chain settlement (Satoshi),
* few big ""masternode"" enabling trustless SPV via fraud-proofs (Satoshi),
* trustless sharding: nodes get/verify only some relevant information, ignoring other parts of the global state (Todd, Maxwell, alt.),
* trustless pruning: nodes get/verify only recent information, discarding all the old information eventually (Todd, Maxwell, alt.).

Unfortunately, not all these theoretical techniques turn out to work in practice: 
* trusted 3rd parties turned out to be a systemic risk
* nSequence channels idea was broken &amp; we had to wait years to be fixed (SegWit+LN channels) &amp; improved (LN trustless onion routing),
* Satoshi's fraud-proofs turned out to be unfeasible, making SPV basically trust-based &amp; the ""few big masternodes"" model easy to censor/attack
* trustless sharding (aka Sidechains???), while being sold as a buzzword by Ethereum scammers, is still a difficult/unproved topic,
* trustless pruning turned out to be unfeasible as well, leaving syncing nodes w/ the need to get/verify ALL the past information, to discard it only after sync to save space.

It takes a stupid to think that difficult problems are magically solved just by some (smart) idea.

8: I think I know Bitcoin enough to say that, as long as the aforementioned fundamental problem (7) still exists (thus excluding future advancement &amp; current off-chain 2nd layers, finally in production), there's a difficult trade-off between easy-validation &amp; easy-transaction. An hypothetical blockchain w/ 200kb blocks every 4hrs would be cheap/fast to validate: we'd run full nodes on our mobiles, orphan-rate would be low &amp; mining decentralized. But only few use-cases (big/slow settlements) would fit on-chain, forcing everything else off-chain. An hypothetical blockchain w/ 10Gb blocks every 2secs would be trivially cheap/fast to use directly for every use-case, including the most stupid ones, but it would be too expensive/slow to validate for anybody, centralizing Bitcoin completely. There's a spectrum in between.

9: While I can accept different opinions about this (w/o necessarily considering stupid who would make the opposite point), I think there're solid arguments hinting at the fact that Bitcoin as-is could be too much shifted into the easy-to-transact extreme of that spectrum (8) just empirically, a lot of people are transacting on-chain (even for very stupid use-cases where you DON'T need censorship resistance at all) while very few people run validating nodes, most relying on centralized 3rd parties that could easily compromised/corrupted/censored.

10:While maybe debatable, the above argument (9) for Bitcoin being, as is, actually too much transaction-friendly (as opposed to validation-friendly), could/should be already pretty concerning already in the current context, that we could/should consider a BEST-case scenario:

* Internet infrastructure is not likely to be partitioned in the next months because of global wars (hopefully), 
* Bitcoin mining isn't (yet) illegal in China, 
* Bitcoin users can sync even without using Tor because Bitcoin is not (yet) fought so hard by government, etc.

But Bitcoin should be able to survive &amp; remain censorship resistant in the WORST case scenario! The same could be said about orphan-rate &amp; mining centralization: arguably too high since years in an overall good case scenario! What could it become in the worst case one?

11: Even if my assessment about the position of Bitcoin as is in that trade-off (9) was wrong (I really think it isn't), I guess it takes a special kind of stupid to ignore the fact that the different failure modes at the 2 extremes are actually NOT SYMMETRICAL at all:while in the ""crippled extreme"" there will ALWAYS be use-cases that will pay/wait enough to be mined, by definition, there are not ways to survive government censorship in the ""centralized extreme"". Given Bitcoin's goals, it's very stupid not to be conservative about this!

12: Regardless of the kind of update/change we are talking about, EVEN if it was super-safe from a validation-costs/mining-centralization point of view, every possible change of rules, good or bad, IS in itself an attack surface that could be used to corrupt/attack the project! This would true ALSO for changes I personally approve, like Segwit (I elaborated further about this very topic in my old ""Split"" article, but it seems to have been taken down by Crypto Insider, i don't know why: https://cryptoinsider.com/split-thoughts-bip148-uasf-segwit-bitcoin-life-universe-everything/ … ...ping @CryptoInsiderCI!!!). 

13: Arguments against contentious ""on-chain scale"" increases (9, 10, 11, 12) are reinforced by the fact that, while for things as fungibility &amp; decentralization it's race against time, for throughput increases THERE IS ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD, there is NO RUSH by definition! Many said we should rush to avoid that ""altcoins will take over"", but this is just logical non-sense. Either my argument about altcoins (6) is true or it's false. If it's true, then altcoins CANNOT take over, because they can't possibly deliver what Bitcoin can deliver. If it's false, then fine: what's the problem in getting financial freedom with one or more altcoins, expecially if we are here for the ideological goal (2) and not for the financial one (1...but even in the case, we can just dump some btc to buy the winner alts). Win win! If that argument is false, there's no need to change Bitcoin in contentious/dangerous way: we can just wait for the ""better altcoins"" (lol). On the other hand, if that argument is true &amp; we DO compromise Bitcoin's security, even just a little, we screwed up our only chance.

14: Even if I was wrong about the current state of Bitcoin (9), the simple fact that there isn't/cannot be ANY RUSH (13) makes obvious the choice to prioritise study/development/adoption of long-term sustainable solutions (off-chain), instead of kicking the can down the road.

While i understand your argument that BCH is surpassing BTC in performance, it remains a coin to stay away from because the territory it is trying gain a market share in is the most highly competative in the crypto space (everyday transaction layer).  BTC does not have to compete with any coin, whereas BCH is competing with the likes of litecoin, ripple, stellar etc... and doesnt even hone the most state of the art protocol.

I could be wrong and i very well might be, however given this approach, it just seems to me that BCH has a tough road ahead, and i believe the only thing keeping it afloat is the fact that people think it has value since it bitcoin in the name.

"It's a bit of both.  It's a legit project with a solid team, that have been working on it for a long time before they ICO'd, and they have the potential to become a major player in the sphere if they keep their promises.  They haven't done any marketing yet, and didn't even list on an exchange themselves, that was all communitydriven.

However, it's also overhyped. Not in terms of price, it's far from the potential mcap it could reach if the team delivers. (and as investors, we invest in future potential as most of this sub keeps forgetting - because anything else is already priced in on ANY project)  What makes it overhyped is some of the excessive shills we've seen in this sub shortly after it went out of ICO, some people apparantly believe it will revolutionize crypto overnight and go 100000000x in the next month.  That's not the case, so it's overhyped because the shills aren't in touch with reality.

That being said, I expect some decent gains on it over the next few months, and it could easily 10x at least...  Think about it as a new Tron of sorts but without Justin Sun, with a bit higher supply. I imagine they will be able to achieve similar marketcaps within 1-2 years at the latest.  I also expect similar amounts of FUD and hate being spread in this sub, but maybe a bit less because the team don't seem to be marketing as aggressively and have a different approach.

Essentially what I'm saying is expect this sub to post alot of shit about, while others will hype it endlessly - and in the end the tokenprice may grow to about 1/3rd of Trons because of the circulating supply, how fast that will happen is a different matter...  Personally I've made it about 5% of my portfolio, and I'll just let it sit for a while...",1525263843

Now it’s almost six months since it was released on mainnet.  Six months ago the new folks who were not around for all the previous broken promises truly believed Lightning Network had arrived and it was just a matter of adoption.

So where is the code that every Bitcoin node should follow for those specifics? up until the Bitcoin Cash fork it was [https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin). So it makes sense to say that Bitcoin Core is what defines how Bitcoin should behave, sometimes against the definition of Bitcoin in the whitepaper \(as is the case with SegWit, which breaks both the definition of transaction and electronic coin presented in the whitepaper, among other things that were broken that have nothing to do with Segwit such as transaction order preference\).

"""manipulation has occurred and will occur"" != ""this is manipulation."" Everything in your video that isn't completely verifiable is complete speculation and frankly seems far fetched. If one exchange wanted to raise the price of Bitcoin it wouldn't look like this at all. The price would rise on that one exchange and as a result the volume on that exchange would fall, then pick up as arbitrage poured in, and then it would deflate slowly. It'd be very easy to spot.

Ever consider this is the result of movement of other cryptocurrencies due to taxation and regulation concerns such as on ETH? How about influx of money away from Gemini due to fees rising? How about new BTC ATMs, vendors, news, algorithmic traders, etc., etc., etc.?

Sure, it could be manipulation. It could be intentional buying at an established support level to increase the price - that could be happening inside or outside an exchange. Or it could be people intentionally colluding to drive up the price. Or whales. Or a school of hammerheads. Or minnows.

What makes it worse is that they seemingly lack any power for self-determination. They lost the social battle to define what bitcoin should be (along with many early devs), and after forking their own version of bitcoin as had been suggested time and again by the small blockers, they are constantly labeled a scam and denied the right to associate with the “bitcoin” idea.

"&gt; Appreciate the basic explanation on how miners and block times work - but it did not answer my two questions. Why is on-chain scaling good? Why is LN bad?

LN is not bad per se, it doesn't solve the problem. It is so complicated for a general user that I don't see any mass scale adoption. So far it has been flimsy and there are bugs to solve, but assume the bugs are all solved. Still you need watch towers, still needs to route too much if there are too many paths, so the convergence is to a few big hubs that need to have huge stakes of BTC for the intended adoption. Routing, amount of funds and potential lock downs due to loss of connectivity are pretty bad.

&gt; The people trying to push the idea that ""only miners need to run full nodes"" really just want the ability to decide the rules of the protocol. 

Not only miners, big businesses would want to directly listen to their Tx in and out. Average joe doesn't really need it, but he *can* anyways. Any consensus will have increasing costs to participate. Validators become lesser in number as the successful ones reinvest their profits in more resources, it is how capitalism works.

&gt; If you only had say, 10 nodes on the network because you only cared about mining nodes, then an attacker could launch a DDoS against 9 of those nodes and publish his (false) version of the consensus.

Each miner effectively runs many nodes. Only taking nodes down doesn't do anything, you need to perform a double spend, that is, you need to replace a Tx with a second version sending funds back you yourself while you effectively gained something out of the first one. So you need to sever the network in two to achieve that and reestablish connection.",1525257115

"&gt; Doesn't more nodes = more decentralization?

No, because nodes are free. You do not even need to run the software itself, just pass the traffic from-to a running node and the network will see you as a legitimate node.

What you want is to have nodes that are politically and economically separate, which is loosely correlated with number. I haven't made my mind on it yet, but casual users are slow to react to threats and are more affected by central distribution channels (repositories, authoritative websites, etc.), so I would group them based on their predicted behavior rather than counting each as disinterested parties.

It is worth mentioning that drowning the network in nodes would not be a successful attack on Bitcoin as a whole precisely because users can always directly connect to miners and circumvent. Which says a lot about what sort of decentralization is a priority. With so much centralization on the mining side, it doesn't even make sense to talk about the number of nodes, IMO.

How to decentralize mining is a whole different debate, which we should have been having all along instead of the node talk. Unfortunately, all solutions required a hard fork, the debate of which then formed the sort of factions we have now.

&gt; bitcoin.com did defraud users by calling Bitcoin Cash (BCH) - bitcoin.

If Bitcoin Core was explicitly not referenced or the tickers were replaced, I would agree with you. As it stands, there is nothing confusing about the ticker symbols and the only thing made deliberate is a political stance. No one is defrauded.

To be frank, the entire debate escalated into a division of the community exactly because Bitcoin Core was declared and upheld as the one true reference client, so if you can not see and understand what Bitcoin Core means, you should not invest in Bitcoin at all. Who is potentially defrauded there is, therefore, moot.

For me, the same rules apply to Bitcoin Cash. If an off-system attack (DoS, patent enforcement, censorship, legal enforcement, etc.) on an alternative upgrade implementation succeeds, it would lose the capacity to be called Bitcoin and should then be labelled as its proper reference implementation. Until then, it can always be legitimately called a continuation of the Bitcoin project by anyone or entity that wishes so.

"&gt; I see your point. Nano was distributed in centralised way so we can't trust devs to not give big share of supply for themself without doing captcha. However unfair distribution apply to almost any cryptocurrency on market. Satoshi mined 1M bitcoins himself, and group of just few people mined another 5M. How this is fair?

It isn't. It's stupid that he holds this amount and still gets celebrated like some kind of god. Satoshi is a bitch that left us hanging and has huge amounts of funds stored somewhere, worth more any greedy dev on a shitcoin can hope to gain. I absoutely agree. 


&gt; If you mean stress test by Brian Pugh, it is true he wasn't been able to get even close to tx/s promised by devs. But bottle neck in his tests was not network capacity, he used single node to send all transactions. If he used multiple nodes running on different machines, I think he could reach numbers close to those declared by devs.


You've obviously done your research on that more than I have, so I will leave you alone. Nano is not bad by itself really, I had a somewhat bad day yesterday and wanted to show you how I can make you hate me. Nano is super cheap and very fast and still under development so it will get better. The captcha thing is weird and nobody knows who owns how much is a problem not only Nano has in Crypto, Monero, my flair, has that too. No hard feelings, just wanted to ruffle you really. 


I use shitcoin, the way a BTC maximalist uses the term. Low market cap, not a scam coin automatically. Low marketcap compared to the established ones. 


&gt; I don't want to argue here. I think Stellar is better than Ripple, but I don't that much.


From what I heard and can tell they do have more humane goals than XRP. Afaik they want to push their currency more to the average consumer rather than straight to banks, which is a concept I admire too. I don't like however that 60% is owned by the devs. 


&gt; No, check my list against. Bitcoin is on it.

My bad, didn't see it in there. 

&gt; IOTA wallet is shit and network is not working reliable yet. But I believe that may be fixed over time.

Same thing with Nano. Again, I hold IOTA aswell, but it has issues right now and I would never claim it's a great innovation. Unless they work around the many problems they have, they will not work. For the moment hype will push them up anyways so we're still both in the clear. I'd advise to not be attached to singular projects and evulate reallocation of your money, as time goes on and you see development happening or not. 


Of course my ear is ringing when I hear them say no blockchain waste of energy and *free* transactions. 


&gt; It is big problem of this market. Exchanges will more likely list ERC20 token or bitcoin clone because it is much easier than integrating innovative project with own code base. Good projects have much harder way than shitcoins in current market.


Exactly. Now the shitty thing about all of this really, I don't quite know what to do, because spreading the good word on Reddit is not going to alter the outcome in any way. I think it's best to accept current situation and be prepared for a bearish market a couple of months, because BTC is unable to recover thanks to infinite shitcoins.

If you genuinely ""know"" that Segwit was a major update making it not Bitcoin anymore, how come you accepted 2010 post-hard fork cryptocurrency system as the ""real bitcoin""? Segwit is like CLTV or CSV updates, which happened prior Segwit. How come CLTV or CSV did not make Bitcoin into Bitcoin-CLTV and Bitcoin-CSV?

&gt;from a technical viewpoint Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin - certainly a lot more than Bitcoin-Segwit is Bitcoin.

Shortly: Untrue. Bitcoin is Bitcoin as is defined by Bitcoin.

&gt;Bitcoin changed from what we both agree was Bitcoin into an entirely different animal.

Bitcoin can be updated. There's no reason to oppose Segwit update, just like there's no reason to oppose e.g. bug patches in any software. (Only people opposing are the ones profiting from said bugs etc.) Well, we all know that BITMAIN has miners which only work on Bcash chain now, as they had hid their use of Asicboost instead of making it overt -- which would've been Segwit-compatible of course. Or in other words, if BITMAIN had announced that their miners are incompatible with Segwit, segwit could've been changed to support their miners. However, BITMAIN didn't want to disclose (instead, they lied that they don't use it) their use of covert asicboost (but which was later revealed by reverse engineering their mining chip), so they made up all these excuse reasons to be against Segwit. In the end, after everybody knew why they really oppose Segwit, Segwit went through just like CLTV and CSV had done.

The speed in which the team develops doesn't seem to match the rest of the market anymore. My prediction is it is not going to be the #1 coin but will still be top 5 in 2020. neo eos and eth I agree with but in no particular order. LTC definitely not as I think other currency coins that are faster and cheaper will take over it in quick order plus I think it will be out of the top 10 this year (already down to 7 where I dont see it pumping up any time soon) I dont know anything about tzero or qash so cant comment.

"&gt;If you attack other people's investment, they hate that shit. Simple stuff, like I'm about to attack your Nano investment.

You can't attack Nano that easy, because it is not shitcoin. Nano has working project and it is useful.

&gt;Did you know how Nano was distributed? People did fucking CAPTCHAS online. That's how you got your Raiblox. There's absolutely no fucking way to know who owns what.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now you can argue that's not much a problem, since the same applies for Monero. But Monero wasn't just given to people that do captchas all day long. How much do the devs own for example, is a question you will never know for sure in Nano.

I see your point. Nano was distributed in centralised way so we can't trust devs to not give big share of supply for themself without doing captcha. However unfair distribution apply to almost any cryptocurrency on market. Satoshi mined 1M bitcoins himself, and group of just few people mined another 5M. How this is fair?

&gt;Another thing with Nano is their claims are far from the truth. Nano has had stress tests, and these tests did reveal drawbacks in that claimed TX/s amount wasn't even close to what was originally claimed. Nano is fast, but not fast enough, really.

If you mean stress test by Brian Pugh, it is true he wasn't been able to get even close to tx/s promised by devs. But bottle neck in his tests was not network capacity, he used single node to send all transactions. If he used multiple nodes running on different machines, I think he could reach numbers close to those declared by devs.

&gt;Use Litecoin, if you want cheap transactions. No captcha bullshit, nothing\- their shit works.

I have nothing against Litecoin, it is solid project.

&gt;Use Nano if you want to speculate and potentially make more money. Litecoin is the safeplayer, where you can transact with 1 cent and it's also very fast. And it's decentralized, which Nano isn't. And it's working, reliably working for years, Nano isn't. And their founder Charlie Lee has no stake in Litecoin, we don't know how much Blox are owned by Blox creator really. You need more? I'm not a fan on Nano either.

I'm saying this again, Nano is not shitcoin, if you are not fan of it, it doesn't make it shitcoin.

&gt;Stellar is the exact same centralized bullshit Ripple is, so I don't see how that's better at all. But again, it's a shitcoin, and shitcoins pump hard, so you will make good money if Bitcoin rises in value. Sure. But is it a good project? Hell fucking no it isn't. 12 billion of coins in circulation currently, are owned by the devs, which is 60&amp;#37;, which is the exact same amount Ripple Labs has frozen in XRP. Same shit.

I don't want to argue here. I think Stellar is better than Ripple, but I don't that much.

&gt;My list is valuable projects is: Ethereum, Nano, Stellar, Bitcoin, Cardano, Monero, IOTA, Binance Coin and Qtum.  
&gt;  
&gt;You do realize that these coins only go up in value and 10x, 15x, 50x, if Bitcoin does well over time and recovers?  
&gt;  
&gt;You know which coin you're not holding at all? The coin responsible for your shitcoins to pump. You're not holding any Bitcoin. You're part of the shitcoin investor problem we have in Crypto and it's a big part why the current bear market might extend for 4\-5 more months.

No, check my list against. Bitcoin is on it.

&gt;It's because everybody wants 10x and nobody wants 30&amp;#37; from Bitcoin, despite Bitcoin being among the only products that actually work and is used in the real world.  
&gt;  
&gt;From top 10, I think Tron, Bitcoin Cash  
&gt;  
&gt;Exactly. Tron, EOS and Bitcoin Cash are the scams in the top 10. Nice spot. Avoid these at all costs, or speculate with them for a short time period to make money ,fine.  
&gt;  
&gt;Even centralized Ripple will work fine as long as Ripple Labs allows it continue working. But Bitcoin Cash? For all I know they might dump that shitcoin any fucking second.  
&gt;  
&gt;You also mentioned IOTA. I have IOTA myself, but purely for speculation, that idiots will buy this trashfire project thinking blockchain is now boring or something. Their shitty software doesn't fucking work mate. They use a coordinator to do snapshots of the network, because they fucking know themselves that it currently doens't work. They have no such thing as a wallet that stores keys. Nothing. You have a CEO who says ""I hate speculators, I hope you're all losing your money, IOTA is backend"".  So is the riota sub mashines now? Are mashines trading your iota on exchanges? Are machines giving your iota trash project value? No it's fucking humans.  
&gt;  
&gt;Have you ever used IOTA yourself? Try it. Try attaching your hard earned money on the shitness that is called tangle. Try it out I beg yoiu and will see yourseflf .

IOTA wallet is shit and network is not working reliable yet. But I believe that may be fixed over time. If they will fix problems over time it will be good project, if not then I lose on this one, simple.

&gt;Again, I have that IOTA ticker on Binance aswell. Speculation.  
&gt;  
&gt;But I'm not bliding myself, saying it's a great project. No. It pumps and then I sell and then I have more coins, which are actually useful and IOTA is not part of those.  
&gt;  
&gt;I totally agree with you  
&gt;  
&gt;You still agree with me? Maybe you understand why I was downvoted. It's because I speak my mind. Not many here dare do it, because you get downvoted.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is also why you see threads predicitng a huge bull marketing the coming months, but you see nothing about the very great potential, that exists, that the bear market will continue for a very long time.  
&gt;  
&gt;You don't see these threads, because they're downvoted. Because people don't like seeing that their crypto is not making them rich as fast as they thought Crypto would.

Groupthink \( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink) \) is strong. That can't be helped.

&gt;Bitcoin has increased in value 9 years, because originalyl shitcoins had to run their own chain or fork. Now all they have to do is create some ERC20 token from ETH, write a whitepaper and done. That coins pumps a lot, so it's interesting to people.

It is big problem of this market. Exchanges will more likely list ERC20 token or bitcoin clone because it is much easier than integrating innovative project with own code base. Good projects have much harder way than shitcoins in current market.

&gt;The market we have right now is simply in a very dire state. Lots and lots of money is still in shitcoins that deserve no value whatsoever, and it hurts Bitcoin a lot.  
&gt;  
&gt;And by the way, our IOTA, your Stellar, my Cardano, will NEVER pump, if Bitcoin doesn't recover. That's the truth. And you don't hold any Bitcoin whatsoever, so you're somewhat part of the problem. You're too greedy.

Can I ask you this:

It seems like many people here are saying a big defining characteristic between /r/btc and /r/bitcoin is the attitude of the mods. If the mods are so impartial and this place has such a good mod setup where they don't ban people etc etc, can you explain why they don't have links to reflect this impartial approach.

For instance: 

- I've found several BCH specific links, that is a site the only mentions BCH.

- I've found zero BTC specific links, that is a site that mentions BTC without mentioning BCH.  The BTC links always also mention BCH. (please show me if there is one)

- I've found zero links about any other fork.

- I've found there is a heavy reliance on bitcoin.com, which is clearly a bch-biased website.

The mods if truly impartial and accepting of all bitcoin discussions could either add more inclusive links to help people access all things bitcoin to make their own decision and contribute to the conversation.... or they could add to the description that this is a pro-bch forum and that the links reflect that.  I don't see the need in being so round-a-bout with it and acting like this forum isn't pro-bch-anti-btc despite the name.

If the mods were not all in agreement with a pro-bch approach the links would definitely reflect that, so I feel like the description could (since the name isn't changing)

I have no issue with this being pro-bch but pretending it isn't, doesn't seem helpful.",1525253922

that you prefer BTC over BCH is your prerogative, but you should keep in mind that there is no ""majority consensus"" about what is bitcoin and what isn't. You could argue most people agree that BTC is bitcoin and you'd likely be right, but as soon as you try to measure ""most people"" you'll fall victim to the same issues that proof of work is meant to solve.

"How can anyone else help, when you've been filled with bad information? You need to do the work here.

I'll shortly address your points anyway.

Bcash is simply a shorter, easier name for Bitcoin Cash. As a bonus, it differentiates it clearly from Bitcoin. Some people started calling it ""derogatory"", because it removes the confusion and clearly marks it as separate from Bitcoin. These are two incompatible systems so it's beneficial to not mix them up. You could argue that you *want* Bcash to be Bitcoin, but that's a totally separate issue and has nothing to do with the fact that two systems should not be called the same. Fact is that Bitcoin is Bitcoin, and Bitcoin Cash is NOT Bitcoin. It can't be twisted in any way to make that fact go away.

FYI, this ""Bcash"" altcoin (https://github.com/bcash-coin/bcash) was made to make up this story of ""Bcash already exists, you can't call Bitcoin Cash bcash!!""). You'd know if you were there, it's hard to dig up discussions of the time, but you can try. The whole point of naming Bitcoin Cash as Bitcoin Cash was to ride on the Bitcoin brand. It's bad to cause confusion. Why do you want to cause confusion by not using a clearly distinct name when referring to Bitcoin Cash aka. Bcash? You could also call it ""Roger Ver's Project"", as RV calls it ""my project"" himself. :)  (Although in reality it's Jihan's project, to make those covert-ab miners have something to mine...)

&gt;Bitcoin Cash actually has a stronger claim to the term 'Bitcoin' than Core's implementation of it

Reality is not changed due to your opinion. All the altcoins and whoever claim that they're more Bitcoin than Bitcoin. All the excuses have been seen. Facts still stand: Bitcoin is Bitcoin. You can use other implementations than Bitcoin Core to use Bitcoin. For example, Bitcoin Knots and Btcd are Bitcoin clients. It looks to me, that you've misunderstood what means ""implementation"" as rBtc is twisting that word heavily, and I suppose that's where you mainly learn your bad information from.

(Btw, My AnduckkBitcoinCoin is THE most nearest to REAL BITCOIN in EVERY way, including code, paper and everything imaginable, but people just refuse to call it Bitcoin like I do... :((  )

Bitcoin is Bitcoin. Think why it is so, and why e.g. Bcash is not Bitcoin and why AnduckkBitcoinCoin is not Bitcoin. In any case, causing confusion by mixing up different incompatible systems names is irresponsible. The only reason Bcash supporters insist being called Bitcoin-something (at least), is to ride on the Bitcoin brand. Btw, in my opinion Bitcoin whitepaper didn't even detail Bitcoin (first code version of it), so it's a super bad argument to say something is closer or further from the original Bitcoin white paper. Also, in reality it doesn't matter shit as facts stand. Bitcoin is Bitcoin. Calling something else Bitcoin will cause confusion. Do you want to cause confusion? Why?

&gt;Perhaps you would prefer that I call Core's implementation of it ""Bitcoin Segwit"" as that is what it forked to?

There's no significant downsides in Segwit update. Why are you not so loud about other updates, like CLTV or CSV? They were applied to Bitcoin just like Segwit. Is it just that you need an excuse why Bitcoin wouldn't be Bitcoin anymore? In any case, that's *your* opinion and no matter what *you* think of it, facts are facts. Bitcoin is Bitcoin.

All in all, these things you must learn yourself. If you genuinely think that Bitcoin is ""crippled"" by some evil actors and that Bitcoin Cash truly is more Bitcoin than Bitcoin, it's hard for others to drive you in the path of facts/reality. Because at this point you've already consumed tons of bad information and most of it is too hard to debunk by others. You have to do the work here.",1525253791

We will have a billion people using Bitcoin in a few years. This will mean each person can make 1 transaction approximately every 5 days.
To enable such levels of transaction, each full node runner will need to allocate 16TB of data per year.

""But we can up the block size"".

Lets increase it so that each user can make 2 transactions per day. Ie, a 10x increase.

Now every node runner needs 160TB of storage per year.

Some of the BCH trolls got burned pretty seriously here in the past month if you didn't noticed, I even blocks a couple of them. As in anything in life, one finds all walks of life.

&gt;/u/rdar1999 : Nope! Only core does everything bad!! They are trolling, harassing, astroturfing, censoring, brigading, fraud, raping, murdering, &lt;insert terrible thing here&gt;! Stuff we definitely don’t do!

&gt;We don’t have any evidence for these crazy claims — besides a couple reddit posts. 

Not true. For me the greatest evidence of BTC being taken over is censorship over the block increase debate plus pathetic deliver of the solutions with many patents around it - LN. There is constant trolling and brigading, and people label you whatever and put you in lists. Also, the vast majority of core people I interact with love to say how stupid and shill I am but most of them have very low IQ. I'm far from being an expert, but geez, the level is really low.

Someone once said that developers are naturally the ones with the least interest in the coin, and there is a high degree of truth in that: their payment is inconsistent, the amount of money flowing around is very high, bribes occur all the time. Hodler devs are very rare.

Thus for me is very clear what happened. Also, I did my research to find out gregmaxwell was involved in litecoin from the beginning. It is just a big pile of crap unfolding the more I dig.

I'm sure the problems surrounding increasing block size are perfectly manageable, the problems with LN are very poorly manageable and it simply doesn't work or replaces on-chain scaling. This is the reason why I support BCH. The beauty of the markets we still have at this point of the crypto history is that I can convert my BCH to BTC or whatever quite easily, so there is no need to ""shill muh bagz"".",1525250870

This is correct.  I've been trying to point this out for years now.

""Fees"" are a total misnomer.  A ""fee"" is a price, usually publicly posted, whose payment guarantees the performance of a service.

[source](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/fee)

&gt; a payment made to a professional person or to a professional or public body in exchange for advice or services

**This is not how Bitcoin ""fees"" work.**

For us, a ""fee"" is an amount attached to a transaction that the sender hopes, but cannot know, will be enough to provide an incentive for the service provider to perform the service.

There is a word for this.  The word is:

**BOUNTY**

We do not have ""transaction fees.""

We have ""transaction bounties.""

I would strongly encourage everyone to start using this terminology and explaining this at every opportunity.  When we start seeing this as a ""bounty market"" then we can finally start making informed decisions.",1525248804

"So, not gonna lie, when Reddit accounts are under a certain age, I always look at the history. I noticed you enjoy the NANO community. Great so do I . Disclosure I own both $NANO and $HOT. Both Long term. I've held nano since mid-December. Haven't sold a single fraction.

Anyways, I noticed this comment by you ""
[–]abl8ed
[-1] 29 points 1 day ago 
The most interesting aspect of the NANO community is the influence that individual community members can have on the code development itself. If I remember correctly, Troy once made a post once that mentioned that they were implementing a new function based on community input, which is awesome.""

Maybe go ask in holo's tech chatroom about their Team's hierarchy and whether they plan to always have a CEO. Ask if individuals from the community contribute to the code. Is anyone free to develop on the platform? Holo is just the flagship dapp on the larger ecosystem, holochain. 

The platform is going to be truly decentralized in an organic way. So you don't like the main core of the community that believes in the project's long term goals?  That's fine actually (though I think you may miss some interesting conversations that might challenge your worldview. Or affirm it, or tweek it. Or maybe it comes out the same), because you don't even need to engage with them, to build a decentralized p2p dapp on their platform. 

You could just engage with the code that's already there on their github and platform and build something decentralized that will scale differently from other crypto projects (the devs argue much more efficient than Ethereum, but I will leave that for people interested in the project to decide for themselves and make informed decisions). 

You could actually build different communities on the DHT network, Holochain that would themselves be decentralized. 

Didn't get to see your main research, whatever it was, because it was removed. 

But I noticed the comments about it being 'literally a cult'. Idk, telegram looks a lot like when NANO was on it's original bull run, all fomo and speculation and misinformation and corrections and clarifications. And  Nano is still at #27 marketcap, showing it's likely here to stay. Free transactions, instant, DAG. 

Colin saw that something wasn't working with blockchain currencies. He decided to approach the same problem from a different angle.
You know what got me excited about Nano? Radically new tech in the space. Not just the same thing, tried a different way. Omg, it's untested though! It could have errors or bugs! So they set up a bug bounty, and kept working on the code. Tirelessly. They wanted to do security audits and make sure they addressed seriously different attack vectors. Fantastic signs of a good project. Nano has tech that could change the game. 

The Holo team has a similar mindset and works tirelessly. They saw that blockchains like ethereum were trying to address a problem that they themselves had been working on (metacurrency project). They saw a  problem with the way it was being attempted and decided to address it a different way, like Colin did. The core members (there were 4 who  worked on project for years in a volunteer capacity, before expanding the team after a very successful initial indiegogo campaign they can tell you about) are geeks and visionaries and they see things differently. That's not a bad thing. It's not a cult. They are welcoming and friendly and invite questions and give real answers. If you look at their documents, they will talk about what they are trying to do and also what they are not trying to do, or even what's not likely the most efficient to put on their system (e.g. video hosting. You could do it, but it wouldn't be efficient). 

At the end of the day. Do your own research. Stop just following articles blindly, shill or FUD. Don't trust, verify. So you have questions and concerns? Does it sound like OP of a FUD or shill article raises good concerns or interesting points or maybe you should stay away or maybe you should FOMO in? Investigate. 


When I found out about the Holo, it was because two people came and shilled it in a discord I was sitting in. I was super critical. I said something along the lines of ""Don't just come here shilling w/e crypto you want"" I say similar things to people who come to places and FUD things. A fair point overall, I think. But I decided to investigate their claims and get to the bottom of it. So I went to their  telegram. I began to ask questions, and I got quick and thoughtful responses. I was fairly skeptical in there. Soon they asked if I could go to their online chatroom in mattermost for some of the more technically inclined stuff I was asking. Turns out some of the founding members were around and happy to answer questions there. They also had a lot of material available to read and videos to watch and the standard things you see with alot of cryptos (roadmap, whitepaper, short one liner of the project, what the aim is, why does it need a token? Why do you an erc20 placeholder token? Why did you need to run an ICO? What were the token metrics? Who are your advisors or investors? Why don't you have advisors (this is interesting)? I spent all night researching their projects and talking in the chatrooms. Then I made a decision to invest.

Yes, I bought the tokens. Yes, I bought a holoport thing and understand what it's for and believe it will actually be useful. No I didn't bet more than I could afford to lose on this. Will I sell some tokens along the way in their journey? Sure. Will I hold some for the mainnet of their dapp even though we really don't know which way the price value will go upon launch (up until project launch it's really speculative). THE TEAM WILL BE THE FIRST TO TELL YOU THEY CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT THE HOLOFUEL WILL BE WORTH IN USD in mainnet or exactly how much cloud computing power you could buy with it from a host with a linux server (holoport or their own rigs). Depends on so many factors because it's an ecosystem. And it's more complex, than just ""this guy has the cheapest electricity, or the most cost efficient machine, or the lowest wattage use, so he will make the most profit."" There's latency, bandwidth, internet speeds, uptime, processing power, harddrive space, probably geography, other factors too. 

The DHT and p2p technology has significant use cases in cloud computing and in smart contract and dapp platforms. Did you initially think this bitcoin thing was weird when you first heard about it on the news and they were FUDing it? Or maybe they had a bitcoin 'fanatic' on to defend it? Did you look at them and go ""what a shill"". 

What about when Ethereum was being created? Did you believe the very early FUDers that said it was a scam and that all the early investors were just doing it to dump on the stupid people who would buy it from for more $$ with BTC? Or did you believe it had a purpose or could do something that BTC wasn't doing? That BTC maybe wasn't meant to do ? Or was at least making a good go at it? 

What about when NANO came out and you heard all the FUD and shilling? 

Did you just ignore all these things? Did you turn a blind eye? Did you just stick with your safe and proven BTC? Or maybe you just sat in your tether and fiat and mocked and trolled the crypto communities that were being built and developed? Or maybe you just stuck with ETH? Maybe you believe it's a zero sum game. One coin to rule them all. I don't know. I have my own thoughts, clearly. Just like you should. But that doesn't mean you should just listen blindly to either side and neither does it mean you should just ignore the opposing side when they have legitimate questions or concerns. Answer transparently if you know that your coin has problems or things it can't solve or isn't mean to solve or needs to be addressed. Be genuine and not just greedy and people will come and build community around your project (devs, talking to you). 

I don't think crypto is a zero sum game. We don't need to be tribal. Just because you own a competitor or what you think is a competitor, doesn't mean you should immediately take a biased stance.

If you invest in a coin, decide if  you truly believe in the long term implementation and success of it, and then decide if it's a  short, mid, or long term hold for you. If you pick mid or long term, really do deep research into everything with the currency. Don't just pick out what you don't like and write a hit piece, because you already put your coins somewhere else. Crypto is still early days. So much more value is coming into the space, so you don't need to go around FUDing or Shilling.  I write mostly about what I like and only invest long term in coins I really do believe in. Doesn't mean you should invest in NANO and HOT/holofuel/Holo like me. And it doesn't mean you shouldn't. 

At the end of the day, if this coin intrigues you, makes you question it, concerns you, go do your damn personal own research. DYOR. Decide for yourself. Make an informed decision for once in your damn crypto life. 

Or don't and just ignore this and go on your own way. 

P.s. OP, I didn't get to see your original thread, can you message it to me, so I can take a look? Thanks! I read through some of your comment history and noticed you are pretty skeptical guy on a lot of stuff, but seems like you like a few coins.

"I like your Porsche 911 analogy. But I think it does not apply to BTC.

A Porsche 911 is a ""sports car"".
Picture this, if Porsche changed the name of the Cayenne to 911 Carrera, that would not be a sports car, and so it won't keep the essence or idea of the original Porsche 911. That's completely different from just ""upgrading"" the 911.

Of course, Porsche is actually a private company and they could really do it if they wanted, they own the name. But they could not say they redefined the sports car or something similar.

Bitcoin is ""A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System"".

I despise bitcoin cash not because of its bigger blocks (which, mind you, I consider an interesting and legitimate approach to scaling), I despise it because it's been hijacked by Roger Ver and his people. Bch's success depends almost entirely on Ver dumping money into promoting it and confusing noobs into thinking bitcoin cash is actually bitcoin.

I am banned from r/bitcoin, I abhor censorship and fanaticism. However, that does not make me turn a blind eye to what Ver, Ayre or Wright are doing.

I agree that mobile phone wallets are an issue with battery life and so on, but they're certainly not the only way that bitcoin can be spent.  I fully expect ""smart cards"" with a payment layer (probably not lightning because of its routing technology concept; but potentially a 3rd layer on top of lightning, if not a second layer along side it) to become a common bitcoin payment method in the future.",1525248164

"&gt; are you telling me you spend basically all fiat to buy bitcoin.

Yes, excluding the automatic payments that I have going out in fiat (such as my rent; but I'll be moving house soon, so will of course discuss the bitcoin option with my new landlord).  I do have some fiat put aside just in case of catastrophic failure of bitcoin, but ""no more than I'm willing to lose"" since I think the catastrophic failure of the euro (my local fiat system) is far more likely than the catastrophic failure of bitcoin.

&gt; from my paycheck i use fiat for rent, food, transportation, bars, diapers, etc.

All of these things (other than rent as mentioned) can be bought with bitcoin easily enough (for me at least).

&gt; and buy bitcoin with what i can save for the future. this is money that i dont plan to use, and if i would need to sell my btc, it is poor financial planning from me.

The way I view it is so: Over time, fiat loses purchasing power on average.  Over time, bitcoin increases in purchasing power on average (although I'll agree the volatility means that over short terms it's simply extraordinarily unpredictable).  Therefore, in the time between me getting money and me spending it on things, *on average* it's better for me to have held that money in bitcoin than in fiat.  My total purchasing power averaged over a multi-year time-span is higher under this method that only using fiat for purchases and holding bitcoin purely as a savings mechanism.

That's not to mention the other advantages such as there not being the option for someone else to say ""no"" when I want to spend what should be my own money.  This happened to me a few months ago with my bank (who refused to believe I wanted to make a €12k euro purchase at Apple) and the time and energy that I wasted fighting that and finally proving that yes, I really do want to spend *my money* on something that *I want to have* is something I want to reduce the risk of ever having to go through again.",1525247989

"\&gt;So the layer 2 system ended up being too easy to control and manipulate and became the cause of the downfall of gold standard. 

Completely wrong. Gold failed because layer 1 was too easy to control and manipulate. It's extremely costly to store, ship, protect, and settle with gold.

"&gt;I pay a set fee on eBay when I sell stuff.  I'm the Bitcoin seller, not the buyer. You are talking about eBay users buying stuff like toasters. Sending Bitcoin is the opposite. No wonder you're confused. Good luck selling that idea to any business. I wandered in here by mistake. Peace out. 

Lmao     

***whoosh***    

You are not grasping the concept of what it means to be charged a fee, vs bidding against another individual to receive a product or service.  

Do you know what bidding is?  
Do you know what it means to bid on something?     


Sending bitcoin is not at all the opposite.   It's literally the same things as bidding on eBay.   
Bidding is bidding. 
You are bidding to have your transaction be part of the blockchain.   
You are bidding for a service.  
You are bidding to have miners exert energy in order to get your transaction into the next block.    
Those who bid the highest receive the service of having their transaction be part of the next block. Those who bid lowest do not get the service of getting into the next block.     
Those who bid the highest on eBay receive a product instead of a service. Those who bid lowest do not receive the product instead of a service.  


Whether you're bidding for a service or a product, the concept of bidding is the same.     


Bitcoin miner fees are determined by you bidding against other individuals,  who are bidding against you. In the exact same way you bid against other people in eBay to receive a product while others his against you.   

Bitcoin miner fees are not the same as a fee being charged by eBay.

"&gt; This is patently false, the EDA was adopted by an overwhelming majority of mining nodes comprising the vast majority of hash rate on the valid Bitcoin Cash network.

You're confused about how the DAA worked and what its function is.  It doesn't matter that it was widely adopted.  It artificially lowered the difficultly requirement, which is the fundamental security model of Bitcoin.  The fact that a lot of miners said ""yeah sure we'll take less difficulty!"" doesn't somehow make that change less of a security concern.

&gt; This is explicitly within Nakamoto Consensus, but it would not qualify as ""Bitcoin"" if BTC at the time (or now) were still a valid chain. Once BTC forfeited its validity, BCH is now Bitcoin per complete white paper Nakamoto Consensus.

Your personal interpretation of ""Nakamoto Consensus"" and how the vaguely outlined rules in the whitepaper ought to be implemented is not a hard objective truth.  You do not get to dictate what is valid for any node except the node you run.  If my node also agrees with your node's rules, the consensus will emerge between our two nodes.

"\&gt;Though once the value transfer nut is cracked you could implement any montary policy you want

You act like it's a given that the ""nut is cracked"" and we should take it for granted. But continued security is not a guarantee. That was the whole point of the Giacomo's argument. It's not enough for Bitcoin to scale transaction throughput. As it's used more, it becomes a bigger target. As it becomes a bigger target, it needs to become \*more\* secure or at the \*very least\* not become more insecure. 

Increasing the cost of validation with bigger blocks makes it more insecure by reducing the number of nodes there would otherwise would be. By trying to make the base layer handle everything transaction wise, you are undeniably hurting its sound money properties. This is an \*undeniable\* tradeoff. Without the foundation of sound money, nothing else matters. 

The common argument that additional mere usage \(via third parties\) counts as ""decentralization"", and therefore node numbers aren't important, is nonsense. You think States won't attack something seriously threatening their hold on monetary policy because lots of people are using it to buy coffee and alpaca socks? If they can they will. And if there's just a small hand full of easily visible super nodes serving the whole network, it will be trivial. It's incredibly naive to think otherwise. 

Sure, the 1MB blocksize is totally arbitrary. It could be 2MB, or 20MB, and maybe even end up surviving and working at those sizes. Who knows? But the point Giacomo makes is precisley that no one knows. So because we don't know, and the risk and stakes are so high, erring on the side of caution and leaving it where it is the only logical and prudent choice. 

We cannot screw this up, especially not to solve a problem so non\-existent it's not even a first world issue that anyone wants a solution for: buying a coffee. ",1525246327

Put another way, method of arriving at pre-chain-fork consensus is irrelevant. Only whether the consensus agreement was implemented validly or not is germane, and this is objectively clear through criteria laid out in the white paper.  

&gt; If it is the case that miners have failed to uphold their consensus by not implementing S2X, the white paper is an insufficient standard against which to demonstrate it.  

Not at all. The white paper only defines what is ""Bitcoin"". Miners using Core to mine blocks after 494,783 without ""2x"" just means they've now created something *else* that is no longer ""Bitcoin"".

"Blockstream is a startup mostly formed by Adam Back \(some idiot ""cypherpunk"" if little note, but mentioned in the whitepaper with an incorrect attribution\) and Greg Maxwell \(Core developer\).

 The largest funding for this came from AXA Strategic Ventures \(part of a massive, global financial conglomerate with Bilderbergers on their board of directors\), and Greyscale which is Barry Silbert's venture cap fund, *who also owns the pro\-Core rag Coindesk among other things.* There are also ties to Bitfinex/Tether as part of a big spiderweb cartel.

Greg Maxwell himself is a serial scumbag, who had previously been kicked out of Wikipedia for being a manipulative, narcissistic bully. BTC's current direction is mostly his own twisted vision. He left Blockstream recently, or at least officially, so who knows where he is slithering about now. 

Originally they seemed friendly and proposed interesting tech like side\-chains. It however became quickly apparent that their goals were to perform a hostile takeover of Bitcoin to either subvert it or kill it.

[His name is ""Theymos"" and he created this sub, and Bitcoin Cash, when he and his other anonymous buddies successfully attacked and divided the BTC community.](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/informative_btc_vs_bch_articles/dl8v4lp/)",1525244838
"&gt; How many does BTC have again?

Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Knots, Btcd, Bcoin, Parity bitcoin etc.

&gt;  just one that has to use censorship


Bitcoin has multiple full node implementations and the alleged censorship is in forums controlled by theymos who isn't a developer. Do note that rbtc also censors posts they don't like even though they advertises themselves as censorship free forum  ( https://gist.github.com/chris-belcher/c9f4b90bec1b2fbf8caaab178719ac24 )

&gt; have not done anything meaningful on BTC for 4 years,

Compact blocks, segwit, assumed valid blocks, bech32 address format, csv, cltv, libsecp256k1 to name a few. I'm not following the developments closely and there's a lot I missed. A bandaid HF blocksize increase isn't the only meaningful development.

&gt; they basically tell you to go fuck yourself if any outsiders submit to their git.

No they don't. Every now and then you can see commits from new people merged. 

Do some research please.",1525244804
"I would agree that Roger isn't helping the cause lately. I agree with the sentiment that Cash is the original Bitcoin project pre\-Blockstream, but the simple reality is that the rest of the ecosystem just calls it Bitcoin and that is just the way it is. It was changed back today to Bitcoin Cash on bitcoin.com, but Bitcoin Core remains which to many of us is fair since the main software running 95&amp;#37; of the BTC network was called Core for many years \(originally Bitcoin\-QT\). Many of us are still plenty bitter at Blockstream and the bought out Core developers for what they did, we still try to fight their hostile takeover, unfortunately that has been showing up where it is least helpful lately.

LN in reality serves a pretty niche use case with some pretty severe technical issues to overcome, like routing. BTC is relying on it to be the big scaling solution, but the problem is LN simply was not created for that. BTC will actually need to have bigger blocks for LN to function correctly, and would actually work far better on BCH. To many Cashers LN is a solution for a problem that Blockstream created, a problem which BCH doesn't have with simple on\-chain scaling. 

It's hard to believe that *all of this* was over literally changing a 1 to a bigger number in the code around 2014.",1525244748
"1) The video was shot long before MtGox broke down, and only covers a part of the operation that had real issues with banking at the time.

2) You seem to be raging as well, and this is the 2nd post that just lists these links and doesn't discuss them.

3) There is nothing wrong with being inclusive and promoting altcoins.

4) so he broke law, boo-hoo. Isn't part of the purpose we built this ecosystem so that unjust and morally despicable rules could get bypassed?

5) A customer accidently got sent a bit over 4 BTC more than intented and refused to return it, this is theft, and is not a $50 issue.

6) I wouldn't support partiotism either, patriotism is stupid.

7) If Ross did indeed kill or try to kill people, then he's a murdurer - but remember that he built a platform to remove violence from illicit trade and acted out of despair due to the legal system exerting threats of, or real, violence against him.

8) Getting denied a VISA isn't particulary newsworthy. You can get denied on grounds of simply thinking differently.

9) Taking an image where he has an emotional outbreak due to trying to articulare the horrors of war and tying it to a price fixation statement, says alot more you **you** than it does about him.

All in all, this post isn't very well-founded, but I encourage people to do read up and get to know all these details anyway; it's good to never forget how things happen and what they mean so you can educate and disregard blatant attacks on ones character - regardless of if you look up to, or down on, that particular character.",1525244722

The world \(including the uninformed\) needs a measure \(like hashrate\) by which they can gauge what the valid Bitcoin is.  Having multiple different opinions on what constitutes as \*valid evolution\* of the white paper is not practical.,1525244512
"I've seen subreddits move, so I thought it was reasonable to move to /r/bch since the top post at /r/bch essentially says ""this subreddit is dead go check out /r/btc"".

"With respect, you guys really need to update your narrative. The last BTC transaction i made cost me pennies, unlike last year. Perhaps it was because it was segwit end to end? I can't remember how long it took because i wasn't anxious about it and didn't bother checking. It was there when i did eventually look, which is all that matters.  If you are going to keep insisting that Bitcoin transactions are slow and expensive in the face of reality you will lose whatever credibility you have now.

That is not to suggest that bch is slow or expensive either, not saying that it is.  Perhaps you guys might concentrate on your own coin instead of wasting time fretting about a crypto you cut away from?

"Your are correct, but it doesn't explain the point pushed by some blockstream supporters that I had the ""pleasure"" to argue with:   

They were saying that the miners themselves are spamming the blocks, to increase fees, and therefore make more money this way.  
This way the spammer wastes no money on the spam.

In this case, the only explanation to the situation is much simpler: there was no spam attack on Bitcoin, otherwise we'd see the same type of attack on all coins. All those transactions were legitimate ones.",1525244408
"I appealed my twitter being locked for 'automated behavior' and said I don't have a phone, my account was deleted a couple of weeks later.  If it weren't for BTC shills, it would happen anyway, they are hitting people randomly to obtain phone numbers.
