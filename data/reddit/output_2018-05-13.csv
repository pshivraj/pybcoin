"Well said and a great job calling out the deluded Novogratz. There is little to nothing unique about BTC (or any other cryptocurency). Either all are or none is, a store of value.

A currency does not need be a store of value. They just need to be able to circulate value. If I want to buy you a beer I may need to send you 10 crypto-units today or maybe 12 or 8 units tomorrow. I don’t need to care about the exact amount, and neither do you, as I won’t acquire (and you won’t sell) the currency until the day the transaction happens. 

This way most users want to hold a small amount of the currency to lessen the inconvenience of acquiring it when needed (which is different from storing value). 

The value comes from a coin’s convenience for remote, permissionless and (pseudo)anonymous use, not from some inherent value or suitability for other purposes (which I believe is extremely limited, or even does not exist).

"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArkEcosystem/comments/7rnsgl/daily_general_discussion_january_20_2018/dsz6a46/

The main ARK network was designed to be a payment layer for the entire ecosystem which is why we are focused so much on keeping it lean. Think about it like this. Say there is a sidechain that provides a service like audible and every month for $15.99 you get 15 ADBL tokens for your membership that can be used to purchase audiobooks. In that sidechain, if it is launched using our Push-Button Blockchain system, the Audible team needs to do absolutely nothing to accept ARK as payment for their service. They will have that ability built into the core layer. They can implement it using pre-built contracts if they implement ARKVM or they can implement it using pre-built Smartbridge Listeners if they don't want full VM (which in their case would just bloat their chain and isn't necessary for their purposes), or they could implement the ARK payment module that we will develop. Using any of those methods, ARK easily and on-deployment becomes a valid payment system for that service or application. Even though that service may use their own token in the app for unlocking features, ARK comes pre-built as a payment layer and requires 0 extra work on the part of the developer.

Now understand that the ARK team is 100% squarely focused on marketing and pushing ARK Blockchain Solutions to developers, start-ups, and enterprises once Push Button is complete as a go-to, simple solution for developing blockchain based projects and every one of those projects comes built in with the ARK payment layer. Could they choose not to accept it? I'm sure their developers could find a way to disable it if they really wanted to and as an open source project, I'm OK with that. But why would you? If ARK has value, liquidity, and is being used by an entire ecosystem, why wouldn't you want to tap into that?

Add to that the idea that every core application that the ARK Team builds will accept ARK natively and that we intend to continue to build out use cases for the payment layer, I hope that you can kind of see where we are taking all of this. Imagine if Bitcoin were really easy to fork and every time someone forked it for their project it had the ability to use BTC in the fork by default for payments without any extra work.",1526279216

You were destroying a worthless network and/or gaining worthless coins. You could do that now with one of the alt coins so its all a self fulfilling prophecy; the ones that succeed are the ones no one destroyed and then question why no one destroyed them! 

Truth is even if a 51% attack were easier to do making any money at all from double spends is still really hard to do once you have the 51%; you have to get something back from one of the spends before either the network reconciles (you fall back under 51% and the legit nodes move the chain forward without the double spend transactions) the network forks (a software change to blacklist those miners and addresses) or the value collapses (once someone realizes there's a 51% attack everyone will lose confidence and Bitcoin drops to zero.)

You're conflating the term banking with currency and liquidity. There was currency before there were banks, many different kinds of it. You're also confusing the ""macroeconomics textbook"" platonic ideal of banking with banks and banksters irl. 

Banks provide liquidity (to some, very conditionally) and do keep money safe (in theory, with the cooperation of a government which can print money at will). Beyond that, banks engage in predatory lending practices, insider information trading with both other major market actors and the government, and are a key pillar of the inflationary federal-bank backed petrodollar system which air-drops currency to privileged actors and manipulates the economy/credit cycle at will. 

Bitcoin does none of that sinister shit. Its inflation rate is hardcoded. It can't be manipulated by the powerful by traditional means. No one can delete your balance because you're a ""bad actor"" in the eyes of the government.

This is (or was)  the culture and the practice of cryptocurrency before all these twee ICOs started coming out promising to bank the unbanked and be exactly like the status quo except plus blockchain. 

So your assertion that banking = the original crypto is wrong on several levels.

"You've never seen an argument against single payer that makes sense???   Wow.  You haven't been paying attention.  

To start just look at Canada and United States.  Many Canadians come to the US for health care, which is regarded to be the best in the world.  No one goes to Canada for health care.   

**I'll also share a personal story.**  I live in a central American country that has both public and private healthcare and hospitals.  

It's a totally private system with zero government involvement or government protections. So malpractice doesn't exist for instant.  

I have the best health care anywhere and it's cheap.  My doctor spends at least an hour with me anytime I want.  That's face to face time with the actual doctor.  Not a nurse or helper.  

I have my doctor's and my dentist's and my kid's doctor's personal cell phones.  I call them anytime I want.  We text photos of the kids if they had a rash.  Many times they give advice and we don't go in.  One time we had to rush to the hospital.  

Public health care is the worst.   Super long waits and the government decides who gets care and who doesn't.  Another major factor that you see huge is connected people, family and friends move to the front of the line in a government health care system.  Abuse is rampant and they have zero competition because many times the government will outlaw private health care. 

So I'd say corruption, long wait times, poor quality of care , and in general the doctors are not as motivated.  Those four reasons but many others.  

And we haven't even gotten into the contracts.  Private hospitals make contracts to save money and get the best.  Governments make deals by who donated to which campaigners and then those guys get to staff the hospitals with their products.  

The list goes on.  I can't believe you're a socialist but into Bitcoin?  Makes zero sense to me.  Bitcoin is best invention of my life specifically because it gives power to the people and way from special interests, the connected, the powerful and the government.

Having $100,000 in cash and putting all your savings into crypto is extremely risky and makes you lose most of your money if your timing is wrong, which is 2 out of 3 times pretty much.

"The problem with your logic is that if it were a plot (by the CIA or anyone else), they could have acquired just as many Bitcoins as Satoshi now possesses (and probably more) without making it clear (as it is now) that all of those coins are controlled by the same entity (which Satoshi has never made any attempt to conceal). There was a time not too long ago in which almost every Bitcoin in existence was acquirable for a fraction of the CIA's yearly budget. 

They could have had their Satoshi persona ""sell off"" his coins to an apparent variety of independent individuals (who would actually all just be them), even running most of the earliest exchanges themselves, and entirely avoided the objection you raise, which they would naturally want to do in order to conceal their overarching plot (unless they're practicing some sort of double reverse psychology 4D chess which anticipates my objection to your objection and accommodates it, which I doubt). They also could have just made it look like multiple entities other than Satoshi were mining in the early days. 

Either way, if Bitcoin is some sort of operation to control an enormous portion of the supply of a popular currency via the Satoshi persona, then it's a quite sloppy one if suspicion is so easily cast upon it by any random redditor. This suggests that it's not, since nothing else about it is as sloppy.",1526277759

"**Deflation**

In economics, deflation is a decrease in the general price level of goods and services. Deflation occurs when the inflation rate falls below 0% (a negative inflation rate). Inflation reduces the value of currency over time, but deflation increases it. This allows one to buy more goods and services than before with the same amount of currency.

"If you agree that blockchain has its benefits, what makes you think Ethereum, with its lead in users and developers, where you can build any blockchain app you dream of, isn’t worth billions? There’s a bit of contradiction there. I could perhaps agree with you on bitcoin or any other currency only crypto, but not with any crypto with a service behind it (other than eth, all of its dapp tokens, siacoin, storj, iota, the list goes on).

The network effect is powerful phenomenon, and Ethereum has a first mover advantage in the field of blockchain apps, not to mentiom its apps span all genres, as opposed to a corporate blockchain that has a limited focus.

If you want a tech story where the underdog beat the established players with innovation that is inherent in newer startups, look no further than the stranglehold that Valve’s Steam platform has on PC gaming. EA, Ubisoft and other large game developers have tried and failed with their own game clients to unseat Steam due to corporate bureaucracy and the network effect.

Most medium sized companies may also find it cost prohibitive to build their own blockchain, but instead build an app on Ethereum with their own token. A parallel to the game industry would be that pretty much all indie to double AA games find themselves on Steam.

Finally I think it is inherent in most people to want to have as much control over their belongings as possible. Ethereum (and other crypto) gives them that, and on top of that there is no central location to hack. All that is needed is a convenient interface so the average person can use the platform (in the financial sector, omisego). And the open ended solidity programming language of Ethereum allows such interfaces for other field tp be built, if not already.

Meanwhile, I find it hard to imagine most corporations will relinquish much control over their blockchains if at all (to the point it isn’t a decentralized blockchain anymore). What’s the point of owning something if someone else has ultimate control over it? Centralization can be hacked. Just look at how many leaks of sensitive data have come from large companies recently.",1526271763

For Bitcoin, it has years of security, network, and many development behind it. It serves as a sound money and pseudo-anonymous currency. 

I can't say much for any other currencies out there. Many either have a use that is inefficient and insecure, or a speculation based on how popular this next crypto will be. It's a one giant speculation bubble for the altcoins.

I do see some use cases for those like Litecoin and Cardano. LTC serves as a alternative to Bitcoin with potentially faster development and more centralization (which is a tradeoff). Cardano aims to solve the insecurity of POS and build a ecosystem behind it.

But ultimately, it's really hard to tell which will succeed and which will fail. I currently see a solid chance for Bitcoin and trailing minor chances for couple other coins. ",1526271327

Once everyone knows its bear market, the reverse will happen, with bulls being downvoted and made fun of. 

1. You cannot trade based on what others are saying they are doing.

2. Market will twist and turn and cause the most pain possible, but the timeframes are weeks to months. There are only a few days in the year where you should buy or sell. Key is spotting when to get in or out. The rest of the days are either so-so or terrible times to trade. Even if you pick a good time, its often that you'll immediately regret it. 

3. Don't forget to take profit.

I sold 70% of my holdings on the 8th when it was apparent this would be a longer term downtrend. I immediately regretted it because the price bounced up. I started to second guess myself, but it's pretty clear now that I was right.

Today the price ran up high and I offloaded the remaining 30%, the price on eth went up another $20 over what I sold at, and I also regretted it, but now we're more than $20 under what I paid.

The thing is, even if I'm right, bounces will happen and I may not have timed it 100%. We could pop up again and head towards $9000 btc. I'm working with a longer timeframe - I expect to be able to buy back in weeks to months, not tomorrow.

The US dollar isn't worth what it is because there is less than 14 trillion of them printed (HA), its valued because we (the people of Earth) believe it has a certain value. If something came along that caused us to lose faith in it, then it could go down just like the Bolivar. No one has any faith in Venezuela's currency. They could stop printing them tomorrow, and the prices would keep going up, because no one would trust them to have actually stopped. Venezuela will have to switch to a new currency at some time, probably after a new regime is chosen. I don't think any country would switch to a crypto currency without a crisis, the only question is, which country will be first.

Planned obsolescence, or built-in obsolescence, in industrial design and economics is a policy of planning or designing a product with an artificially limited useful life, so it will become obsolete (that is, unfashionable or no longer functional) after a certain period of time. The rationale behind the strategy is to generate long-term sales volume by reducing the time between repeat purchases (referred to as ""shortening the replacement cycle"").

Producers that pursue this strategy believe that the additional sales revenue it creates more than offsets the additional costs of research and development, and offsets the opportunity costs of repurposing an existing product line. In a competitive industry, this is a risky policy, because consumers may decide to buy from competitors instead if they notice the strategy.

Real world contracts, loans, commodities, etc. all select a currency to work in to keep things simple, and there are plenty of examples of making a killing in one currency only for the exchange rate to extract most of the profit (and vice versa).

TL;DR: No-one will ever loan ""enough bitcoin to buy an apple"" you'll be on the hook for the entire appreciation (or save the depreciation)",1526267573

"The good thing with Bitcoin and other crypto (decentralized) is that technically one can never be late to buy it, as money represents purchasing power. Those who buy it today paves the road (with higher risks) for a deflationary pricing environment for the future users as we're moving power away from structure systems as central banks and governments. Will it last, yes, but no one can predict where people actually will be holding/trusting their money towards as even banks will start their own crypto currencies in the future to try to compete with the decentralized crypto currencies that already shocked the way of life.

Bitmain is not obligated to make sure small time miners get a huge ROI, Bitmain takes the risk to spend money into R and D to create better miners so they are entitled to it's profits.

"**Deflation**

In economics, deflation is a decrease in the general price level of goods and services. Deflation occurs when the inflation rate falls below 0% (a negative inflation rate). Inflation reduces the value of currency over time, but deflation increases it. This allows one to buy more goods and services than before with the same amount of currency.

My opinion is the BCF is legit as far as organizations of this sort go. The Satoshi's vision networking event was well put together. I don't think the BCF is a good idea because donations are not a sustainable form of funding. At least they are trying to do something. Anyway if you don't like it don't donate. You can't have a permission-less system and at the same time dictate how they spend their donations.  If they just up and exit scammed with 100% of the donations like the litecoin equivalent did it would just be par for the course. I think Roger Ver is doing good enough promoting bitcoin cash that we don't need the BCF. At the same time I don't feel as though the BCF's existence is detrimental to bitcoin cash.,1526266352

It’s okay for good projects, at the beginning, to be focused on the important stuff (aka the function of the product) rather than the advertising side of it.

"Yes, with a hard fork, miners have to agree if they want to stay with the miners that are forking. But in a contentious situation, they have the **option** to decide whether to change their rules to go with the new fork, or to stay with the old chain/rules. 

SegWit, for example, was contentious -- big blockers never wanted SegWit. But it was crafted as a soft fork to eliminate the opportunity for contention.

Mike Hearn wrote some really good blog posts about these issues. 

This one is about the soft/hard fork issue: https://medium.com/@300ff465a65c/c6a050c792e7

This one is more broad about the whole scaling debate, but the most pertinent part is how he describes what happened when he (and a few others) introduced bitcoinXT. BitcoinXT, contrary to common belief, was not attempting to create an altcoin fork. It was a fully compatible bitcoin client that had no real change save one -- it allowed miners to **vote** on whether to raise the block size via a hard fork. It required a 75% majority before it would be activated. The censorship campaign against BitcoinXT was in truth a campaign against even **allowing a vote**, not a campaign against a violent coup as they would have you believe. The campaign was against **allowing the miners to decide**, by 75% majority, whether to raise the block size or not. This fact, when I learned it, was one of the things that made me ""switch sides"".

"Dude, you are so wrong.. sorry for that..

&gt; At least a valid response to these videos which prove LN can never work:

1) Why to build a conclusion on some politician opinion? These videos makes no point from technical viewpoint. I've seen them. Actually, lightning works already, even in ""bleeding edge""  statues. So why you are spreading misinformation that it cant work? Yesterday was last time i made LN tx on BTC network.

&gt; LN with its 4 MB every 10 minutes

2) Khm... LN payments has nothing to do with blocksize. These are off-chain. These payments are instant and almost free. What you mean with 4MB? What you mean with 10 min? Originally i was talking about LTC with 2.5 minutes per block. With LN the network trougput is thousands tps (tx per second). 

&gt; BCH has an actual scaling plan to continue increasing the block size.  

3) BCH with 32MB has about 120 tps, but blocksize is not the only parameter that allows such troughput.. it requires 50 Mbit/s connection between nodes (what is nearly impossible now if we are talking about  for connection world-wide between computers) with very high computational requirements. Technically, 32MB blocks cannot be utilized for now.

4) On the other side, there is a Litecoin, with ~50 tps already, without LN. LN gives it exponential grow possibilities. But for now even 50 tps is more than enough.

Are you buying maximum size hard drives for you computer every time such appears on market, or you add more hdd space when you're existing hdd are almost full?

I'm not attempting to confuse anyone. This is the plain truth of events: BCH modified the difficulty adjustment schedule. There was nothing expected about modifying the difficulty adjustment schedule. Doing so means the moving average adjustment is not consistently calculated over the history of the blockchain. The significance and merit of such an approach are open for debate, but an intellectually honest description of the fork requires acknowledgement that it occurred.

"True, inflation makes it hard to save money and come out ahead. That’s why the most optimal strategy is to keep a few months of cash savings for emergencies and invest the rest in *anything else*.  Putting a house fund in TIPS for example gives the person interest + inflation protection, but given the nonexistence of personal finance classes in school it’s no wonder nobody knows to even consider that. 

While for short term savings goals it really isn’t ideal to keep them in investments due to volatility, I have changed my mind on that one and have moved most of my individual savings to Bitcoin (since it will be a cold day in hell when I convince my wife to move some of our joint savings, despite inflation risk).

RE: disenfranchising holders

Part of the reason the average joe (or anyone) holds crypto is because they believe it will retain value over time. If blockchain adaptation primarily occurs via hardfork of the original blockchain, value will be retained very well and holders can sleep at night even as technology morphs over time. If adaptation occurs via flippenings to brand new coins, holding becomes harder and crypto becomes less valuable.

You order a bunch of parts from a wholesaler, so you have a channel open with them.  They, in turn open channels with parts suppliers, who open channels with parts manufacturers.

"**Sell In May And Go Away**

TLDR: https://i.imgur.com/zW8hsF9.png

Bitcoin has now retraced and declined a Fibonacci 50% of the April Fools' rally from the 01-APR-2018 low to 05-MAY-2018 high.

16 days of gains erased in 6 days: the markets take the stairs up and the elevator down.

The first leg of the decline unfolded in seven waves dropping 10%.

The second leg of the decline thus far has been a single relentless wave dropping over $1000 over the course of a day and half.
Persistence of selling has been attributed to a police raid of UPbit—South Korea’s largest crypto platform.

In regards to wave relationships, the second leg of the decline has thus far been a Fibonacci 1.236% extension of the first.

RSI on the 4-hr is now oversold as can be, dipping below a reading of 20. Barring any wave subdivisions, there appear to be enough waves to suggest a temporal bounce.

The decline from the 05-MAY-2018 high to 12-MAY-2018 low may bounce with the following targets (BITSTAMP):

@8875: 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of 05-MAY-2018 high to 12-MAY-2018 low.

@9080: 50% Fibonacci retracement of 05-MAY-2018 high to 12-MAY-2018 low.

@9140: 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of 01-APR-2018 low to 05-MAY-2018 high

@9285: 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of 05-MAY-2018 high to 12-MAY-2018 low.

9110 (BITSTAMP) is the average of the second and third aforementioned confluence levels.

Should a bounce be underway, it may offer an opportunity to get near as possible to the psychological 10,000 level again to offload HODL positions either at profit or loss. 

From then on, the Sell In May And Go Away decline is expected to resume and retrace at least 78.6% of the April Fools' rally to 7245 (BITSTAMP) at a minimum.

What business is going to accept Facebooks coin as a way to buy things at their store. None of them are because they could just have there own coin.

"In this scenario.... the original terms would have been a loan of the apple. 

Lending a system or object of value with the purpose of obtaining something else would then render the agreement in terms of the value of when the loan was made and the value of the objects being lent. 

In an economy where BTC is hypothetically still as volatile and expanding in value, it would be common knowledge that loan terms would be defined not in being paid back in BTC, but rather in what BTC could buy at the time given its value at the time. So if I borrowed 1 BTC from you in 2009 to buy an apple, you get back the value of the apple in BTC today. Loans can not increase in value except through adjustable interest rates. And no one should be stupid enough to sign a loan in terms saying they’d pay back in BTC. They ought to pay back the value or purchasing power of what the loan was used for. 

Loan for an apple plus 20% in 2009? Ok... you get back what an apple is worth today in BTC plus your 20%. 

Nice try though. 

In the event of a mortgage loan priced in BTC, I wouldn’t pay back the appreciated value of BTC. Instead i’d pay the loan back in terms of what I earn today in relation to the value of the loan of the day I took that loan. 

No system of lending would ever exist where the value of the loan itself increases at the expense of the borrower. The value of the asset that the loan bought could increase, but never the loan itself. ",1526258041

"&gt; Based on my observation the adoption is poor, 

popular operating system repositories has litecoin node and wallet included, there are many merchants accepting litecoin, there are many development libraries available for working with LTC chain. Much more wallet implementations compared to BCH. Such services as open-source BTCPay Server for payment processing are available for accepting litecoins out of box.

&gt; fees are not lower than BCH

they are. i spent today all the day on this subreddit trying to tell folks about LTC. you are third or fourth sayin that fees aren't lower. Where did you get it?

Sample tx: https://chain.so/tx/LTC/a98a95f97d9537e4b123fe11b3c046fca438de2efbdc169e6b3f6cb8ee95c030

Sent $1, paid in fees $0.00036716

LTC fees are lower mathematically for now:

Litecoin: 0.226 kb * 0.00001 LTC/kb * $140 = $0.0003668 in fees

Bitcoin Cash: 226 bytes * 1 sat/byte / 100,000,000 (divide by this to convert satoshis to BCH) * $1460 = $0.0033 in fees

&gt; transactions are not faster than BCH 

LTC has instant 0-conf transactions, but LTC block-time is 2.5 minutes, which is 4x faster than BTC or BCH. When you send LTC to exchange it takes about 15 minutes, while when you send BCH to exchange it takes 60 minutes.

I will stick with a simple payment protocol here, and go with Bitcoin/Litecoin/NANO

The key barrier IMO, is abstraction. 

Just like the internet in 1990, it was not simple to use. You had to work to understand it, it was clunky, and confusing to anyone who wasn't already into it.

That is where cryptocurrencies are right now. You have to know the difference between a public and private key, you have to make sure to keep backups of your wallet files, you have to download many different wallets to use different protocols. And the majority of these wallets/apps are just not user friendly to a non-tech minded person.

My parents still get frustrated and confused with mobile web browsers. So you can imagine how far crypto has to go before people will start trusting their finances to software.

It needs to get to a point where a 60 year old man/woman can click 1, maybe 2 big buttons on their phone, and have funds available to them. Then be able to click a big ""PAY"" link, and have the software fill in the receiving address, and complete the transaction.

But he wasn’t as anti-bitcoin in person—it was more of a don’t invest more than you can afford to lose attitude.

Nope

Litecoin is way more useful than BTC because it's cheaper to use and more secure (no replace by fee).

Bitcoin Cash is even cheaper to use than litecoin and is designed to remain so indefinitely (ceteris paribus). It's also at least as secure as Litecoin and some argue more so. 

Those are the minor reasons though. The most important reason BCH is a better investment is because of it's developers and it's community. They are a group of incredibly diverse idealists who are full of passion and are quickly and sucesfully improving the consensus rules, the web ecosystem, as well as BCH's overall organizational structures.

"The correct term is ""forward compatible"", not ""backward compatible"". After a soft fork, nodes with old code can still process transactions/ locks created by new nodes. That's forward compatibility. Backward compatible is the reverse - new nodes can understand blocks/transactions created by old nodes. Every fork ever, in the history of Bitcoin (there are more than you think) are backward compatible because current BCH nodes and BTC nodes can process the whole chain all the way back to the Genesis block.

So if a soft fork means that old nodes can process new-rules transactions, how exactly is that possible? How can we introduce new consensus protocol rules and old code knows how to process that? It sounds like magic because it is. It's a clever way to add new rules that old code will accept without understanding them. This is one reason I say it's a ""trick"".

You say that a majority of miners have to agree to the soft fork. OK, but what about the other miners that didn't vote or didn't want the change? If they did nothing, the cleverness (and deviousness) of the soft fork technique would mean that their nodes would start accepting the new rules even though they never opted in. This is the other reason I say it's a ""trick"". Miners who disagreed had no way to disagree, they were going to be tricked into accepting SegWit transactions even without upgrading to segwit and without being able to actually validate them correctly. ""Soft forks"" are totally anti-social and have been sold to you as the opposite.

This is also the reason that the BCH hard fork had to happen before SegWit was activated. The original BCH miners were outsmarting the trickery that was trying to force them to accept SegWit without their consent by creating the hard fork themselves so they could opt out.",1526253935

Also, just an FYI, lots of credit card companies and a few major banks are banning the purchase of BTC with their accounts so you may actually not have the option to use a credit/debit card. 

All of these sites take their cut one way or another. I’d generally advise not using a credit/debit card unless it’s absolutely essentially that you have BTC in your account ASAP because you pay dearly for that convenience.

If you’re residing or visiting a country, then that government has authority over you in some capacity.

They can only confiscate the keys sort of speak. I believe that is what people mean when they say Bitcoin is non-confiscatable. ",1526252938
"Dude re-read what the guy said:

&gt; it is assumed that miners will behave in a responsible way and not game the system for greater financial reward.

His point is NOT that an attack by miners is possible; IT IS POSSIBLE. In a decentralized system without Proof of Work and built only on trust it is possible; it's called the Byzantine Generals problem.

His point is much more specific: he says that it is only miners good behavior that is the reason why they are not doing a 51% attack for profit.

This point is WRONG. It is Proof of Work that is stopping them from doing it not just good behavior. Proof of Work is the solution to the Byzantines General problem, Satoshi was the first one to solve it (which is why it's sort of a big deal.)

You do not have to trust miners, that's the whole point. Their behavior is not your concern, that is the whole point. A 51% attack is possible but not in their financial interests, that's the whole point. 

Yes you can perform a 51% attack on Bitcoin, if you have enough money and do not mind spending it all to break Bitcoin go ahead. You won't make money from doing it though. THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT.

"&gt;It makes sense, NOW, to invest in bitcoin

After it lost more than 50% of its value in the last 5 months and shows no sign of any increasing adoption and is in fact being accepted by fewer of the top 500 US retailers now than it was 4 years ago?

Bitcoin cannot see the same gains it already has without requiring several more times than the global GDP. 

&gt; It is a level playing field NOW where people arent paid in monopoly money with crazy debt.

How do you think you, some guy in a village in Mozambique who doesn't have internet access and hasn't even heard of bitcoin, and someone who bought 10,000 bitcoins for 2 pizzas 8 years ago are all at a level playing field?

There are individual owners of bitcoin who have the power to completely crash the value of the currency at will. No other top 10 currency is so poorly distributed that a single person could half its value in minutes.

&gt;Putting my money every week in Bitcoin is the safest and possibly smartest investment currently with major rise still yet to come.

Talk about comparing apples and oranges.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is P2P electronic cash as created with the Genesis block by Satoshi. Low fees, reliable 0-conf transactions, and a fully validating and fully redundant network with massive ongoing future development.

Litecoin is an almost pointless cryptocurrency with protocol-enforced high fees which is generally used as a testnet by Bitcoin Core. I am unaware of any active development outside of merely porting over SegWit/LN.

BCash is a payment processor based in Brazil. I'm not sure if they're publicly traded, how someone would go about investing with them, or why you are asking about centralized payment processors in a crypto sub.

"**Pareidolia**

Pareidolia ( parr-i-DOH-lee-ə) is a psychological phenomenon in which the mind responds to a stimulus, usually an image or a sound, by perceiving a familiar pattern where none exists.

Common examples are perceived images of animals, faces, or objects in cloud formations, the Man in the Moon, the Moon rabbit, hidden messages within recorded music played in reverse or at higher- or lower-than-normal speeds, and hearing indistinct voices in random noise such as that produced by air conditioners or fans.

**Overfitting**

In statistics, overfitting is ""the production of an analysis that corresponds too closely or exactly to a particular set of data, and may therefore fail to fit additional data or predict future observations reliably"". An overfitted model is a statistical model that contains more parameters than can be justified by the data. The essence of overfitting is to have unknowingly extracted some of the residual variation (i.e. the noise) as if that variation represented underlying model structure.

**Motivated reasoning**

Motivated reasoning is an emotion-biased decision-making phenomenon studied in cognitive science and social psychology.

If bitcoin becomes more widely used than fiat, then pricing may start to happen in bitcoin. If let's say hamburgers and man hours started being priced in bitcoin, you could have inflation or deflation, but since bitcoin is capped at 21 million and 99% of that coin supply will have been issued by 2030, inflation is virtually impossible in such a future. Deflation is possible, and indeed likely, considering that more coins will be lost than the newly issued (add on top of that the ever ongoing productivity increases in most forms of production, which is also deflationary).

"The very first Bitcoin client was actually called Bitcoin-QT (because it used the qt graphical framework), which was later renamed to Bitcoin Core in 2011 I believe. 

Bitcoin Core also came to represent the developer group behind this client as well, where a dramatic power shift occurred that effectively pushed out most of the original developers of QT/Core. This software was hijacked by the private startup called Blockstream, founded by these second generation Bitcoin Core developers. (confused yet?). In this development of BTC was effectively centralized by force. 

The Bitcoin Core software comprises about 95% or so of the *Bitcoin* network as well. Therefore, we believe it is completely appropriate to refer to BTC as Bitcoin Core after the fork, as *Bitcoin* stopped existing on August 1st last year.  

Bitcoin Cash was created as an umbrella name for the various compatible large-block clients that came about over the past 4 years like Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic, and the newest of them Bitcoin ABC that actually initiated the Cash hard fork.

Sorry bud you are copping a lot of shade because you have picked two of the scammiest projects in crypto,1526249028
"Max size per transaction 100 kilobytes.

The smallest transaction possible is 1 input 1 output, about 192 bytes.

A standard 1 input 2 output is about  225 bytes.

An extra input takes about  147 bytes while an extra output is about 34 bytes.

So at the extremes you got:

* 677 inputs, 1 output,
* 1 input, 2936 outputs.

Both take close to 100 kilobytes.

And at 1 sat/byte they could fill the block with 80 transactions with the average cost per transaction being 100 000 satoshi per transaction with little or no room for smaller transactions to drag the average down.

The sat/byte would still be 1, that is the only metric that makes sense.

Counting each outputs as a transaction, with maximum outputs would be extremely cheap, just above 15&amp;#37; of a regular 1 input 2 output transaction. The cost per transaction would be just above 34 satoshi.

But the cheapest way to increase both the Median and Average cost per byte per block would be to send 4.1 MB \(16.1MB after Hard Fork\) of 192 bytes transactions with for example 1000 sat/byte per block. It would be impossible to lower the median at all, the average could be lower than the median and the average would at maximum be reduced less than 50&amp;#37; even when filling the rest of the block with 192 byte 1sat/byte transactions. Even filling the rest of the block with 0 sat/byte would have no impact on the median in that scenario.

To increase the median cost per transactions, and have the minimal amount of transactions, 79 100kb transactions, with just enough room 80 for 192 byte transaction with a high sat/byte cost.

To increase the average cost, 80 transactions close to 100kb, then a single 192 byte transaction with extremely high miner fee.

But if the goal is just to increase the average and median cost per byte and set a price floor, then the simplest is just to send more than 8MB per block of whatever the sat/byte the floor would be.

But to bump that floor up 1 sat/byte after the 32 MB limit increase would cost 0.32 Bitcoin Cash per block, 46 Bitcoin Cash per day, to get the often sustained 100 sat per byte from Bitcoin would cost 4600 Bitcoin Cash per day and it would give miners 32 Bitcoin Cash extra per block mined, which would have the unintended consequence of getting more hash power from profit oriented miners.

If they managed to get 1000 sat/byte at 32 MB blocks it would mean that Bitcoin Cash would get the large majority of hash power from profit oriented miners for as long as they could afford to keep it up.",1526249027

"&gt; Why are you acting as if eveyone who operates a node doesn't have to run the newer version of the software that is on a new fork of the original chain?

I have no idea how you got that idea. I have said nothing like that and frankly, it sounds pretty unrelated to the subject anyway.

&gt; It's not like the devs release a patch/update to vertcoin-core and all of a sudden everyone is running the new version

You just argued updating to stay ASIC resistant, but now people have a choice? So you're admitting that in fact the coin was never ASIC resistant in the first place and that the move to temporarily annoy ASICs (to pretend to be ASIC resistant) is actually bad because that would split the community.

&gt; but if forks do occur multiple times successfully it may be a test that the coin is not as decentralized as thought 

So again, the coin is either not ASIC resistant or it's ""not as decentralized"". Exactly like I said.

&gt; It is possible to know if hashrate is constatly monitored, once again,

No. You can't see the difference between more GPU's being added or ASICs being added. Especially if the ASICs are trying to hide it, which just means they will be saving on power and thus still mining more than their fair share.

&gt; If you change the algorithm you are not kicking off the majority of your security

Well it's not like coin-hopping GPU's provide any real security to begin with, which 10x more efficient ASICs (that are unable to jump to another coin) definitely do. But then you kick them off, so you loos 90% of your security right away. Good job.

&gt; they are not selling their miners

Only if they need to hide that fact. If you don't pretend to be ASIC resistant, they don't need to hide and they can sell them to anyone who wants them (i.e. better decentralization).

&gt; I am being realistic and am psoting potential defects, 

Yet refusing to draw the only logical conclusion.

&gt; be simple parameters that can be altered as opposed to algo changing

Read the article I linked, it goes into exactly that (tl;dr it's easy to make an ASIC that is flexible that can simply be re-configured to these changing parameters).

&gt; I was hoping the all knowing super smart /u/coinjaf

Looks like there more than one thing you're not clear on.

&gt; You're really a strange dude by your writing, as if you have the answers to everything but the future is not known.

I like to point out bullshit when I see it. Especially when I see ignorant gullible people dropping money into false technobabble pushed by clear scammers. If my audience doesn't follow my line of thinking then that's clearly my lack of skill in explaining the logic. But then again I'm only trying to warn and nobody is paying me, so in the end: what do I care if they lose their money?

I'm just a road sign along the path towards understanding Bitcoin. A journey everybody, by definition, has to undertake for themselves. I try to warn for cliffs and dangers, while pointing in the general right direction. As opposed to scammers and wannabees that try to confuse and fleece as many passerby's as they can.

In the end all roads end up at either Bitcoin or nocoin. It's just a matter of how many detours people take and many cliffs people fall off before they get there.

"This is a sensible reply. I think this issue is getting blown out of proportion. We all know a huge percentage of XMR transactions are sketchy in nature, and yes, refunding XMR effectively ""launders"" it because of how Monero works. 

Now what do they do with the coins? Do they keep them? Do they burn them? Do they forfeit them to authority? Can we get answers on that please before spreading some ill informed FUD \(to me it looks like this right now\). 

I am open that they may be acting sketchy, but there seems to be a lot of missing information in the thread, information that'd be required before calling anyone an outright SCAMMER. 

Besides, it would probably be a good idea for them to drop XMR all together if they are so uneasy about handling XMR transactions. Note that this seems to only happen with the XMR coin, and if you know a bit how regulations in the US, Canada and EU are becoming tough for crypto, then them doing this kinda make sense. There's a wrong belief in crypto that you can just flip the middle finger and go on with your business without caring about regulations. Well...it certainly is possible for holders/traders if they take care, but for a huge registered business like Changelly, they have no choice but to be very compliant. People saying Shapeshift is not doing this as a proof it is okay not to care about regulations are thinking short\-term. For all we know, they might just start doing this as well whenever law enforcement is going to ask them to do it. You can't be cypherpunk and a big registered company at the same time. Not realistically if you want to survive it the long term.

There are much more developers working on LTC integrations than in BCH.

if Litecoin had zero development, there will be not possible to see:
&gt; popular operating system repositories has litecoin node and wallet included, there are many merchants accepting litecoin, there are many development libraries available for working with LTC chain. Much more wallet implementations compared to BCH. Such services as open-source BTCPay Server for payment processing are available for accepting litecoins out of box.

Sure, that sounds nice, but there are different types of 'paid'. If you pay 1 cent for a million transactions, that's paid, but it makes it easy to DDoS the network. 

&gt; Litecoin gives also possibility for off\-chain transaction. It is lightning compatible 

BCH is too. I have no problems with a good off\-chain solution, but it doesn't seem one will exist anytime soon. Till then I feel like on\-chain is the way to go. BTC is doing no\-chain \- it forbids users to use it. 

&gt;  think we must solve problems when they appear  

Exactly. For BTC the problems appeared, but they didn't increase the cap. LTC is claiming that will follow BTC's footsteps, thus let the blocks get full too. That's a reason to go to BCH for me. 

&gt; many of customers pay with LTC, are accounted instantly \(never had  problems with 0\-conf tx's\), and they can pay for even seconds of using  this service. 

Exactly. 0\-conf is useful and should be used. RBF only makes sense if you're letting the blocks get full.

Also, he assumes things like miners enforcing it and only if inputs and outputs match, and he also stated that all edge cases must be handled (which they haven’t and they won’t, hence why scaling on-chain provides incentive for an ultra-powerful Bitcoin (BCH) infrastructure), this renders 0conf far more superior to you taking an intentionally disabled mechanism and defaulting it.

The adoption rate is much easier to scale than other alts because bitcoin cash can integrate so easily into the bitcoin ecosystem already in place. That’s not the same for these smaller alts. This alone is a reason to hedge. Beyond that, the money and adoption will flow to the coins with the best use cases. At this point the only thing keeping btc afloat are trading pairs, hodlers, and an underwhelming speculative scaling solution in LN. You’re correct that many will find a use case long term, and neither will likely die, but I think BCH has the best shot to challenge long term. It’s the most hated in crypto for this reason alone.

"There isnt anything about that in the whitepaper, as the paper is just a framework and theory. Scaling decisions and insight were not possible until there was real software to test, where you can see Satoshi talked a lot about this after the software was released. 

In regard to removing the artificial 1mb cap-

&gt; It can be phased in, like:
&gt; 
&gt; if (blocknumber &gt; 115000)
&gt;     maxblocksize = largerlimit
&gt; 
&gt; It can start being in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that block number and goes into effect, the older versions that don't have it are already obsolete.
&gt; 
&gt; When we're near the cutoff block number, I can put an alert to old versions to make sure they know they have to upgrade.

More from Mike Hearn's personal account-

&gt; Satoshi said back in 2010 that he intended larger block sizes to be phased in with some simple if (height &gt; flag_day) type logic, theymos has linked to the thread before. I think he would be really amazed at how much debate this thing has become. He never attributed much weight to it, it just didn't seem important to him. And yes, obviously, given the massive forum dramas that have resulted it'd have been nice if he had made the size limit floating from the start like he did with difficulty. However, he didn't and now we have to manage the transition.
&gt; 
&gt; ~ Mike Hearn, on bitcointalk.org, March 07, 2013, 06:15:30 PM

It would seem Satoshi's intention was to scale on chain, [in addition to 2nd layers](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Payment_channels#Nakamoto_high-frequency_transactions).

"As i mentioned in my other answer, i am also relaying on 0-conf on LTC chain while selling cloud-hosting service. Never had any problem. RBF issue is almost same theoretical as making 25MB transaction on BCH32MB chain, which will cause nodes functionality. On one side you are OK relaying on 0-conf tx's, on the other, you ar aware of highly theoretical attacks due to RBF. These are completely rare case which arent appearing actually. So you might be OK with both 0-conf and RBF tx's. Maleability issue, which isnt fixed on BCH chain for now also makes possible attack-vector, but is far away from real cases. Moreover, there are no wallets that allows users to hijack transactions by default, you need qualified engineer to do so. It is reasonable for large sums. But you should never relay on non-confirmed transactions while working with big amount of money. It is also not reasonable. Simple example - if you are selling crypto for large amount of cash, you have to spend more time on counting bills (filling papers), than waiting for confirmation.

When you selling physical items online, you always have time gap before sending item, which allow you to confirm transaction in any way. 

Answering to security issues - it depends on hashrate. All major exchanges require 6 confirmation for both BTC and LTC. There are also issues with block-time regarding to orphaned blocks, but LTC is proven for years and orphaned blocks aren't causing any serious issues. Orphaned blocks may appear as well on BTC/BCH chain. ",1526247010

Thinking you can somehow buy up and ""hodl"" the majority of a currency so that people will have to pay you 10,000x what you paid just for the ability to trade is blatant rent seeking on artificial scarcity. It's no different to any other oligopolistic attempts at buying up a finite resource and then price gouging, no matter how much its dressed up as ""reward for risk taking"".

IMF are the people who give nations loans when no one else in the market will do because they're considered such bad credit risks. They have never tried anything like buying up 80% of a nations currency (let alone the worlds currency), so that they could charge a 100,000x mark up on the remaining 20%.

&gt;Many nations that the IMF gave loans to probably should have gone bankrupt rather than compromise on the services they provide their citizens or privatizing important national resources.

Either you've worked out something that teams of people ambitious and talented enough to run nations who have degrees in economics and politics from top universities haven't, or they're actually getting more out of the deal than they're losing. Which is more likely?",1526246375

"**Nordic model**

The Nordic model (also called Nordic capitalism or Nordic social democracy) refers to the economic and social policies common to the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway, Iceland, the Faroe Islands and Sweden). This includes a combination of free market capitalism with a comprehensive welfare state and collective bargaining at the national level with a high percentage of workers belonging to a labour union; and state provision of free education and free healthcare as well as generous, guaranteed pension payments for retirees funded by taxation. The Nordic model began to earn attention after World War II.

Although there are significant differences among the Nordic countries, they all share some common traits. These include support for a ""universalist"" welfare state aimed specifically at enhancing individual autonomy and promoting social mobility; a corporatist system involving a tripartite arrangement where representatives of labor and employers negotiate wages and labor market policy mediated by the government; and a commitment to widespread private ownership, free markets and free trade.

"For those that haven't read it, that post was inspired by an Astrohacker post that Bitcoin was the Economic Singularity.  And this guy put all his savings into Bitcoin in June 2011:

https://web.archive.org/web/20110608132715/ttp://astrohacker.com/ahc/bitcoin-is-the-economic-singularity

His advice for everyone:

 &gt; How to proceed:

&gt; Since bitcoin appreciates in value very rapidly during the singularity phase, you should convert all of your liquid assets to bitcoin as quickly as possible. Do not keep any cash, savings, or checking beyond what you need to pay for goods and services that cannot yet be paid for with bitcoin. The more things you can buy with bitcoin, the more bitcoin you should keep.

&gt; Stop wasting money on excessively expensive meals, televisions, cars, and anything else that loses value quickly or instantly. Instead, put your money into bitcoin. You will be much richer that way. You may think having less stuff is less fun, but actually the pleasure of financial freedom far, far outweighs any losse

I have done my research and due diligence in understanding how the system is working on the retail side and my conclusion is that it is not good. Financial institutions are lagging behind technology and you will see it slowly move towards the crypto verse because the system is fundamentally built on sound financial code ability. Financial institutions are also not recruiting top talent in tech and that is another hinderance to their future survival. 

Actually, the current system &amp; internet is built on FREE and the fundamentals of crypto is NOT FREE. Crypto allows people to monetize their data, instantly transfer funds and control their finances. THIS is what will draw global usage once people realize how institutions are hiding this from them.

4. Why is their founder a dick. I get that a founder with a vision can get very passionate and sometimes not care about FUDers, but that doesn't make a coin a scam.
5. I looked at their Skycoin subreddit for the last month and couldn't see circle jerk. What are you talking about? [https://www.np.reddit.com/r/skycoin/comments/8d7f92/official\_skyfleet\_community\_video\_contest\_1337/](https://www.np.reddit.com/r/skycoin/comments/8d7f92/official_skyfleet_community_video_contest_1337/) I get that some people were banned, which might have been a bad decision.

"I have, and I run one too. And you're right that it's huge. It's not sustainable.

And that's exactly why BCH's approach is so attractive. Ethereum was incentivized to deviate as much as possible from Bitcoin when they launched, which is why they've built the whole separate state tree into the chain, and that's the unsustainable part.

The difference is the Bitcoin's scaling problem is speculative (No one knows what exactly will happen, which is why I think it's worth a try to go both ways and try the ""big block"" experiment), whereas that of Ethereum is pretty much 100% definite that they can't scale unless they come up with a working solution because of the way they architected themselves. This is a separate problem from simply writing data to the blockchain.

If Bitcoin's scaling problem is like jumping off an airplane with a parachute and you need to figure out carefully how to land, Ethereum's scaling problem is like jumping off an airplane WITHOUT a parachute, making a call to a parachute vendor, getting it delivered while you're falling, and safely landing.

Bot are modified, so it is just as correct to say either one is the ""original"", the other being the ""fork"". There are various other criteria people use to decide for themselves which is the ""original"" -- most accumulated proof of work (BTC), most true to the roadmap laid out in the Bitcoin white paper (BCH), forward-compatible with a particular era of Bitcoin Core reference client versions, I believe 0.12+ (BTC), designed for the low-fee, on-chain, peer-to-peer currency model that used to be central to the whole idea of Bitcoin (BCH).

Ultimately this argument will never be decided because the two sides are using different metrics for determining the truth. Ultimately, the argument is about ""how does one define what 'bitcoin' really means when the actual original Bitcoin protocol/chain doesn't exist any more?""

You have to decide for yourself which metrics you think matter more. For me, I think that neither one is the original, they are both forks, and therefore they are both worthy of the name Bitcoin. BCH adds ""Cash"" to distinguish it as the one that is intended to be used as peer to peer cash.

It is a usability problem that sadly was not addressed before the client was released and there has never been any clear will of the community on how to better address it.

My own proposal is:  make the lowest unit *1 bitcoin* instead of 1 satoshi, and make 100,000,000 BCH = 1 Satoshi (giving the creator a higher honor as the biggest denomination instead of the smallest). This would effectively make the supply cap 21 Quintillion BCH, or 21 Million Satoshi. 

Eliminating the decimals entirely helps because no one wants to buy a fraction of something, and feel somehow cheated doing so. I'd rather buy 100 Bitcoin than .00000100 of a Bitcoin. Id feel like I really got something for my money. We like nice round numbers.

This kind of change would be completely semantic for wallets and others to adopt and doesn't actually change anything about the protocol, it doesn't care about 8 decimals, we do because such small numbers are incomprehensible and difficult to communicate. 

Another issue for the ""cash"" or ""bits"" idea is that using a 100 satoshi standard could quickly become dated and no longer make sense if the fiat price increases drastically, leaving us with the original problem.

"&gt;I think you confuse the word egalitarian with equality.

I think you're the one confused but what the word means:

""believing in or based on the principle that all people are equal and deserve equal rights and opportunities.""

We have radically different ideas of what an ""equal opportunity"" consists of if you think that the opportunity someone has who just heard of bitcoin today (or just got an internet connection), is equal to that of someone who could mine 200 bitcoins on their desktop computer for a few dollars of electricity in a few days.

you're saying two directly contradictory things: one that bitcoin distribution was set up in such a way to ensure equal opportunity to all, that the average person would be able to get their hands on bitcoin, and two that the distribution of bitcoin was also set up so that a tiny number of early adopters would have the opportunity to become a new extremely wealthy elite that only people who got into bitcoin at the start had the opportunity to do.

How exactly is that more egalitarian than just a consistent deflation rate so that someone who gets into bitcoin 20 years from now will stand to gain exactly as much as someone who got into it 10 years ago?

The distribution of bitcoin was designed specifically not to be egalitarian and not to provide equal opportunity. The entire plan to encourage early adoption was to offer inequal opportunity, by promising huge rewards to first comers that would then dwindle down to nothing, causing those who got in earliest to profit massively from those who came in later. There's a name for that kind of distribution. And its not ""egalitarian"".

&gt;If supply was limited from the begining that would have caused much higher prices and left early adopters (average people) with less btc therefore leaving more for corrupt institutions to buy up later with their massive amounts of fiat dollars

The average person has no bitcoins. How many bitcoins do you think are held by hedge funds and venture capitalists? It's millions by the way.

Your claim that this distribution will allow the average person to get bitcoin whilst locking out ""corrupt institutions"" doesn't pass basic reality testing. The complete opposite has happened, the vast majority of bitcoins have gone to a tiny number of people, yet you want to pretend this isn't happening because it sounds bad to acknowledge that you want to be in a tiny rich elite of early adopters, which can only happen if by definition the distribution is not egalitarian and early adopters get a massive advantage on everyone who comes later.

&gt;How would you have done it differently? Give all the bitcoin to the IMF to distribute equally to all citizens and unborn humans??? Because for sure they are trustworthy enough to do that...

If those are the only two options you can think of then no wonder you think Bitcoin is the most egalitarian currency distribution method ever conceived. 

But yes, that would be a more egalitarian option if you could trust them, which you can just as much as you can definitely trust an anonymous fake japanese man not to tank the value of your currency at any moment by moving the million bitcoin he decided to award to himself when printing bitcoin was cheaper than printing dollars.",1526236689

Because this exact time last year I literally told everyone that I firmly believe bitcoin would reach $10k at minimum before the year 2017 ended. And everyone including my own mother looked at me and told me I was ludicrous. I’m not a genius nor am I 100% knowledgeable about cryptocurrencies as a whole. But I simply assessed the benefits of btc and saw what makes it superior to banks/physical cash and wouldn’t be surprised if btc reaches $100k+ in the next decade. I’ve been buying since April 2017.

When you can just hold bitcoin, there is little incentive to invest into new ventures to try to grow your wealth. This would make entrepreneurship far more difficult as they would find it more difficult to access capital because no one would need to take on risk.

""Lastly, can they score a trifecta with security?

Unfortunately this is where QuarkChain exhibits some weakness as adversaries require only 25% of QuarkChain’s total hash power to launch an attack, as opposed to 51% of Bitcoin’s total hash power.

Because of the two layers of blockchains, QuarkChain has designed the network such that the total hash power for the root blockchain maintains roughly 50% of the total networks hash power at all times.

So if malicious miners are able to amass more than 25% of total hash power, they could potentially launch double spend attacks or other such malicious behavior.""

And security is the most difficult problem to solve. Other blockchains can also do very high tps by lowering security so it's not THAT impressive. Not that this is a bad project but people get hung up on tps too much I think.

Cardano has been working very hard to solve security problems with their PoS and recently had a big breakthrough. Their PoS has now near identical properties to PoW. And when security is solved scalibility will come.

Quarkchain has some other problems that need to be solved first as well (see article on hackernoon). And I honestly don't see Quarkchain or other newer blockchain projects solve their problems before Ethereum or Cardano.

"""Gas"" is the name for a special unit used in Ethereum. It measures how much ""work"" an action or set of actions takes to perform: for example, to calculate one Keccak256 cryptographic hash it will take 30 gas each time a hash is calculated, plus a cost of 6 more gas for every 256 bits of data being hashed. Every operation that can be performed by a transaction or contract on the Ethereum platform costs a certain number of gas, with operations that require more computational resources costing more gas than operations that require few computational resources. 
The reason gas is important is that it helps to ensure an appropriate fee is being paid by transactions submitted to the network. By requiring that a transaction pay for each operation it performs (or causes a contract to perform), we ensure that network doesn't become bogged down with performing a lot of intensive work that isn't valuable to anyone. This is a different strategy than the Bitcoin transaction fee, which is based only on the size in kilobytes of a transaction. Since Ethereum allows arbitrarily complex computer code to be run, a short length of code can actually result in a lot of computational work being done. So it's important to measure the work done directly instead of just choosing a fee based on the length of a transaction or contract.

Bitcoin Cash is a cryptocurrency. In mid-2017, the developers not content with the Segregated Witness feature implemented a change to the bitcoin code. The change, called a hard fork, took effect on August 1, 2017. As a result, the bitcoin ledger called the blockchain and the cryptocurrency split in two.

If all the miners collude and generate a 'bad' block that your full node detects, then you just get forked off the network and now you are standing still with your full node as the 'bad' chain continues to grow.  Non-mining nodes are just about worthless in terms of protecting the network.

- you cannot bribe all the miners 

- even if you hacked, the bad branch will get orphaned eventually.  nobody is going to tolerate 100M bitcoin upper limit just because some 16 year old russian kid hacked miners.

- if bad blocks are produced and kept by &gt; 50% of miners - Bitcoin's value would drop *substantially*

"White paper mentioned ENG tokens are used as fees for computations (like gas on Ethereum).

https://www.enigma.co/enigma_full.pdf

7 Incentives

Since Enigma is not a cryptocurrency or a blockchain, the incentive scheme is based on fees rather than mining rewards, where nodes are compensated for providing computational resources. Full nodes are required to provide a security deposit, making malicious behaviour punishable.

7.1 Security Deposits

A possible attack on MPC protocols takes advantage of the lack of guaranteed fairness in the proto- col. Under certain conditions, a malicious party can learn the output and abort the protocol before other parties learn the output as well. While this attack, when carried out by a majority, cannot be prevented, it can be penalized. Using Bitcoin security deposits for punishing malicious nodes in MPC has been investigated by several scholars recently [22, 23]. We use a similar model, and extend it to penalize other malicious behaviors such as breaking correctness, which is validated by the SPDZ protocol (see section 5.1.2).

To participate in the network, store data, perform computations and receive fees, every full-node must first submit a security deposit to a private contract. After each computation is completed, a private contract verifies correctness and fairness were maintained. If a node is found to lie about their outcome or aborts the computation prematurely, it loses the deposit which is split between the other honest nodes. The computation is continued without the malicious node (e.g., by setting its share of the data to 0).

7.2 Computation Fees

Every request in the network for storage, data retrieval, or computation has a fixed price, similar to the concept of Gas in Ethereum. Unlike Ethereum where every computation is run by every node, in Enigma different nodes execute different parts of each computation and need to be compensated according to their contribution, which is measured in rounds. Recall that every function is reduced to a circuit of addition and multiplication gates, each of which takes one or more rounds. A node participating in a computation is paid the weighted sum of the number of rounds it contributed to and the operations it performed (addition, multiplication).

Since the platform is turing-complete the exact cost of a request cannot always be pre-calculated. Therefore, once the computation is finalized, the cost of each request is deducted from an account balance each node maintains. A request will not go through unless the account balance is over a minimum threshold.

7.3 Storage Fees

Fees for data storage are market based and time limited. The hosting contract is automatically renewed using the owner’s account balance. If the balance is too low, access to the data will be restricted and unless additional funds are deposited, the data will be deleted within a certain amount of time.",1526232215

Now regarding gov't/bank etc rigging the price: Keeping the price low would require selling a lot of bitcoin, but once that runs out it's over. I'm sure the gov't has a lot of  btc from the silk road confiscation and buying. But I think the population of civilians hold most.

If the gov't wanted to manipulate the price higher, they could certainly do that, as they can print as much money as needed.

Because bitcoin is a 24/7 Market with very little regulation and barriers to trading it should continue to act as a free market, the price should be reflective of the fair value of what individuals are trading at.

"your posts doesnt make any sense from technical behavior. and i explained pretty detailed why. if you feel you're right - feel free to arguing your position.

1) post about settlement - while you are right what confirmations are, you're talking about instant unconfirmed tx's as it is something unique in BCH network what simply isnt true. unconfirmed tx's are in majority of coins and they cannot be completely trusted. That's what is PoW about in general.
2) post about median fees - poor wallets or stupid usage of technology doesnt make technology itself poor. Same shit happening in BCH network. Anyway 0.0003 or 0.003 or 0.03 or even 0.05-0.15$ (as it is in BTC) fees are affordable for majority of users, if we are talking about the ""daily usage"" for uncensored, international and fast (compared to fiat) transactions. TX price matters when we are talking about automated and microtransaction use-cases. LTC fits better  than BCH these cases for now. There is no black and white. something may be better or not. Thats does not mean that BCH is useless, but you cant argue that its the best alternative out there. 
3) My general point is speed and utility. You are completely missing that ETH is not for payments. 
4) In your comparasion you do not include differences in current load of both LTC and BCH networks, also you dont . At least BCH wallets must be forced to 1 sat/b fees to make your arguments reasonable.
5) I am not arguing block-time decrease to 1 second. I am talking about exact coin - LTC. We can see that this network is working very well at much larger scale then BTC. At current scale there are no problems caused by orphaned blocks in LTC network, so what your point to mention them in our thread context? Sure you can have your own opinion about the block-time, but this is nothing more then your personal opinion. I am arguing with exact facts and numbers, not my opinion. Do you get it?
6) And last, but not least. Why i need to care where your money is? What relation there is between your believes and actual crypto technology? 
7) There are also other alternatives beside LTC and BCH to Bitcoin, but from all of them LTC has best adoption rate (apps, services, development libraries, network decentralization and many more). It also is already tested for years at pretty large scale. You are completely missing this point i think.

All i mentioned forced me to  conclusion that you are not well understanding technology, so why then you use technical terminology? Why you are driving thread to off-topics?",1526230917
"
Turner’s best-known case, the one that put bitcoin on the map, was the prosecution of the founder of Silk Road, the first large-scale “darknet” market to use cryptocurrency. Darknet markets exist on the so-called Dark Web, a section of the internet accessible only with software designed to make users anonymous. Silk Road was an online marketplace that accepted only bitcoin as payment, allowing its vendors and customers to conceal their locations and identities. From 2011 to 2013, more than 100,000 Silk Road users bought and sold over $200 million in drugs and illegal goods, ranging from weapons to forged driver’s licenses, according to prosecutors.

Authorities closed Silk Road in October 2013. Silk Road 2.0 appeared the next month and remained active for about a year before authorities shut it down. Other illicit marketplaces emerged to take its place. The July 2017 takedown of the darknet market AlphaBay involved the cooperation of law-enforcement agencies in more than seven countries. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the site had twice as many users as Silk Road, and from 2015 to 2017, transactions totaled more than $1 billion in bitcoin and other digital currencies.

Headline-grabbing arrests and seizures have done little to slow the flow of money to darknet markets. Last year, $660 million in bitcoin was sent to darknet marketplaces, up from $57 million in 2012, according to Chainalysis.

“It’s kind of like Whac-A-Mole,” says Greg Cipolaro, the chief executive of Digital Asset Research, a cryptocurrency-analysis firm. “Every time they close one down, another one opens.”

One of the largest darknet marketplaces operating today is Dream Market, where, on a recent afternoon, Turkish heroin was advertised as “topquality!” and “Vanilla Kush weed” as “100% organic.” There were weapons for sale—tasers, butterfly knives, a “wallet ninja multi-tool”—along with Nike tracksuits and “lifetime” porn-account subscriptions. A vendor named Bizzey advertised “5x XTC 220mg Donald Trump,” for 0.004038 bitcoin, or $31.68. A photo showed orange tablets resembling children’s multivitamins in the shape of Donald Trump’s head. Bizzey had 4.94 stars and 36 reviews. “Amazing speed and stealth,” read a five-star review. “Even got a freebie. would recommend!”

How criminals cover their tracks
In December, officers led Louis Meza into a Manhattan courtroom, where a clerk informed him that he had been charged with grand larceny, kidnapping, robbery and other crimes. The clerk asked Meza how he would like to plead.

“Not guilty,” Meza said.

During the hearing, Vinocur, the assistant district attorney, said the prosecution’s case was strong, citing the security-camera video and statements Meza made to police.

According to Meza’s lawyer, the case will be uncommonly difficult for the prosecutors. “The burden of proof is on the prosecution to show where the cryptocurrency is, how did it get there and who put it there,” Horn says. “It’s not like walking into a bank vault and saying, ‘There’s the cash.’ ”

The missing ether underscores a larger issue facing law enforcement: the difficulty—and occasionally the impossibility—of investigating and prosecuting crimes involving cryptocurrency. “Prosecutors are always about following the money,” says Scott Christie, a white-collar criminal-defense lawyer at McCarter &amp; English, who previously headed the computer-hacking division at the U.S. attorney’s office in New Jersey. “If you can’t follow the money, you can’t prove your case.”

A number of firms have developed software designed to follow the flow of cryptocurrency transactions. In a financial-technology co-working space in Manhattan, Kim Grauer, a senior economist at Chainalysis, opens a software program called Reactor. “When you go into Reactor, you’re going into the world of bitcoin,” Grauer says. Reactor and other so-called blockchain-analysis programs visually depict the trail of cryptocurrency transactions, allowing law enforcement to see the movement of funds in a way that would be impossible with cash. But these programs have their limits. Many transactions are associated only with anonymous addresses, represented by the “string of numbers and letters” that confounded prosecutors in the Meza case.

To identify an individual associated with one of these addresses, Grauer says, an investigator would look for an “off ramp,” the point where cryptocurrency is converted into fiat, or government-backed, currency. This is typically done through exchanges, websites that let users trade cryptocurrencies and convert them to traditional currency.

Exchanges are the part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem most accessible to law enforcement. If a criminal uses an exchange that collects its customers’ personal information, prosecutors can attach a name to a transaction—provided the exchange cooperates with authorities. But tech-savvy criminals are increasingly opening accounts with fake names at overseas exchanges that don’t comply with U.S. laws.

In June, Kathryn Rodriguez, a former assistant U.S. attorney at the Justice Department in Washington, testified about cryptocurrency in front of a U.S. House of Representatives committee. Rodriguez said subpoenas are ineffective when exchanges don’t require names or identifying documents to open an account. “Even though investigators can follow the funds by analyzing the blockchain, they may not be able to connect those funds to a culprit in the real world,” she said. “We have received ‘Mickey Mouse’ who resides at ‘123 Main Street’ in subpoena returns.”

Noncompliant exchanges are just one of the tools criminals use to evade authorities. “What we’re seeing crooks do now is use a mixer or a tumbler,” says Tom Flattery, a deputy district attorney in the high-tech unit of Santa Clara County’s district attorney’s office. “It’s a service that will mix transactions with several others, moving through multiple accounts and multiple countries. There’s no way for law enforcement to track it.”

One cryptocurrency mixer, Bitcoin Blender, claims to make transactions “100% anonymous.” According to the company’s website, “Bitcoin Blender completely removes any connection you have with the coins you buy or sell, meaning nobody can use Blockchain Analysis to track you down.” Unsurprisingly, Bitcoin Blender could not be reached for comment.

Criminals seeking additional protection have abandoned bitcoin in favor of currencies that offer additional privacy protections. Monero, a currency its website calls “secure” and “untraceable,” uses technology that hides the sender, receiver and amount of transactions. Although recent research has pointed to possible security flaws, a Monero spokesman has said developers have made improvements designed to increase privacy.

Mixers and identity-shielding currencies point to a future where criminals’ financial transactions could be impossible to trace. Large narcotics traffickers and money launderers are hiring increasingly sophisticated technicians to move cryptocurrencies as discreetly as possible, says Jean Walsh, chief of the investigations division at the Bronx district attorney’s office, a trend she expects to continue until cryptocurrency is adequately regulated. “The amount of effort to evade being traced and tracked, both on computers and on electronic transactions—it’s something they spend 24 hours a day concentrating on,” Walsh says. “Once the criminals continue to improve their technology, our fear is that they will be anonymous.”

"The Crypto Crime Wave Is Here
From stickups and drug deals to white-collar scams, cryptocurrency-related crime is soaring—and law enforcement is scrambling to keep up
By Corinne Ramey

On a Saturday afternoon in November, Louis Meza made plans to meet a friend and fellow cryptocurrency enthusiast for drinks at Ruby Tuesday in New York City’s Times Square. “We’re going to have a great time,” Meza said in a text. “And by the way, I’m putting you in an Uber car at the end of the night.”

A former salesman at the food-delivery service Grubhub , Meza is described by friends as gregarious and courteous—a 35-year-old poker buff with an entrepreneurial streak and an appetite for risk. The two men had known each other for about 15 years. They met for drinks and, around 7:40 p.m., Meza’s friend said he was heading to the subway. Meza insisted on an Uber and ushered his friend—listed in court documents as “the victim”—into a gray minivan waiting outside.

According to the Manhattan district attorney’s office, a gunman hiding in the back seat of the van popped up and demanded the victim’s wallet, keys, cellphone and a USB drive, which contained ether, a type of cryptocurrency. The victim handed over everything but the drive, which wasn’t on his person; the gunman pulled a hood over the victim’s head. “Where is your 24-word passphrase?” he demanded again and again.

Newsletter Sign-up

After two hours, the victim managed to escape. He found himself in Harlem, where, according to prosecutors, he called 911 from a deli. The victim had made a “very small investment” in cryptocurrency as early as 2010 that had since mushroomed to $1.8 million. He kept the ether on a USB drive in his apartment, along with a piece of paper containing the passphrase required to access it. By the time he got home, both the drive and the passphrase were gone.

An indictment unsealed in December accuses Meza of robbery, kidnapping and other crimes. Meza pleaded not guilty. But according to prosecutors, security-camera video shows Meza unlocking the victim’s apartment with keys and emerging about a minute later with a small white box, which, according to the victim, held his ether. The day after the theft, Meza transferred $1.8 million in ether to an online account in his own name. “We see the $1.8 million get deposited into that account on the morning of November 5, and then we see it being moved all over the place,” Assistant District Attorney James Vinocur told the judge in the case.

Vinocur told the judge that prosecutors had been able to seize only about $600,000 of the money. “$1.2 million is still outstanding, and we don’t know where it is,” he said. “That is the nature of cryptocurrency, that we can see the address it was sent to. It doesn’t mean much to us. It’s just a string of numbers and letters.”

And what seemed like an open-and-shut robbery case is proving much more complicated.

The Meza case is part of a recent spike in cryptocurrency crime, prompted by the soaring values of digital currencies like bitcoin. Chainalysis Inc., a firm that analyzes cryptocurrency transactions, says reported thefts of bitcoin worldwide increased from $3 million in 2013 to $89 million last year.

For many criminals, cryptocurrency is less cumbersome than cash. Hackers hold computer systems hostage and demand instant, anonymous payment in bitcoin. Drug dealers sell in dark corners of the internet, obscuring their names and locations. Narcotics traffickers move and launder their profits with clicks of a mouse. “The cases have exploded,” says Gabriel Bewley, a special agent in the virtual-currency initiative at the Drug Enforcement Administration.

Blockchain Intelligence Group Inc., which makes software that tracks cryptocurrency use, estimates illegal activity accounts for about 20% of the transactions of five major cryptocurrencies—bitcoin, Monero, Zcash, ether and litecoin—or about $600 million each day. Researchers working at the University of Sydney used artificial intelligence to identify cryptocurrency transactions consistent with criminal behavior and estimated $72 billion of illegal activity last year using bitcoin alone.

What exactly is cryptocurrency?
In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, bitcoin’s anonymous creator published a white paper under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” described the major impetus behind the digital currency: Eliminate the need for third-party financial institutions like banks and brokerages. “A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash,” Nakamoto wrote, “would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another.”

Every bitcoin transaction would be recorded on an encrypted public ledger now known as the blockchain, preventing someone from spending the same bitcoin twice or counterfeiting the currency. And because the blockchain is stored on a decentralized network of computers, the records of these transactions would be theoretically impossible for hackers to corrupt. But removing banks from the equation poses a problem for law enforcement, which relies on financial institutions to provide records needed to secure convictions.

Bitcoin 101: What It Is, How to Invest

Bitcoin is one of about 1,500 cryptocurrencies, all of which exist in a legal and regulatory gray area. The Internal Revenue Service treats cryptocurrency like property—not like a currency or a security but like an asset. The Securities and Exchange Commission, meanwhile, has said that initial coin offerings, or sales of new cryptocurrencies, should be subject to securities laws to protect investors from fraud. In the court system, the definition is similarly ambiguous.

A federal judge in Brooklyn is expected to rule on one issue in the coming months. The case involves a Brooklyn businessman named Maksim Zaslavskiy who, in July and September, launched initial coin offerings for two new cryptocurrencies: REcoin, purportedly backed by real estate, and Diamond Reserve Coin, supposedly backed by diamonds. Federal prosecutors charged Zaslavskiy with fraud, arguing that he sold unregistered securities. Zaslavskiy’s lawyers have asked the judge to dismiss the charges, arguing that cryptocurrencies aren’t securities and therefore aren’t subject to securities laws. “Virtual currencies such as the ones at issue here present regulatory challenges for securities laws that were written in the 1930s—decades before the invention of the computer,” the lawyers, Mildred Whalen and Len Kamdang, wrote in February. Zaslavskiy’s case is pending.

In 2014, Florida state prosecutors charged website designer Michell Espinoza with money laundering after he sold bitcoin to an undercover detective who said he would use the currency to buy stolen credit-card numbers. Espinoza, prosecutors argued, was acting as an unlicensed money-services business and facilitating illegal activity. The judge disagreed. “This Court isn’t an expert in economics,” she wrote. “However, it is very clear, even to someone with limited knowledge in the area, that bitcoin has a long way to go before it is the equivalent of money.” Prosecutors have appealed the ruling.

This legal uncertainty, combined with cryptocurrencies’ volatility, is complicating the prosecution of Louis Meza. The Manhattan district attorney’s office asked to sell the seized ether because prosecutors feared its value would decrease, says Moshe Horn, Meza’s lawyer.

“They wanted to turn it into cash so they couldn’t be blamed,” Horn says. “Then the question becomes, do they have a right to?”

The district attorney’s office ultimately decided not to sell it. The answer to his lawyer’s question is still unclear.

Digital currency’s criminal history
Criminal activity has plagued digital currency since its inception. “Remember E-gold?” says Serrin Turner, a cybersecurity lawyer in New York. E-gold was the name of both a digital-currency service and a currency that was purportedly backed by actual gold. Its founder designed it as a payment system that would allow for the easy, anonymous transfer of funds. This made it popular with criminals, according to federal prosecutors, who claimed E-gold facilitated child exploitation, investment scams and other criminal activities. In 2008, E-gold’s directors pleaded guilty to money-laundering charges. The service subsequently closed, but similar payment systems quickly took its place.

“This notion has been around for a long time,” Turner says. “Digital currency has greased the wheels of the cybercriminal ecosystem.”

Before joining the firm Latham &amp; Watkins, Turner was a prosecutor in the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan, where he prosecuted E-gold successor Liberty Reserve, a Costa Rica-based digital-currency business that enabled anonymous payments. In 2016, Liberty Reserve founder Arthur Budovsky admitted to laundering more than $250 million in criminal proceeds and was sentenced to 20 years in prison.

The theory is that the government can get the best and brightest to organize the society from the top down in a manner that's superior to a society organized from the bottom up by individuals.

That model has been proven deeply flawed by the collapse of socialist societies such as North Korea, Vietnam, The Soviet Union, Cuba, Venezuela, etc.

However, for some reasons humans don't really learn from these things well.  For some reasons the Marxism remains very attractive to roughly 50% of people.

Anyway, Trump is fiscally conservative and therefore believes that government should have the smallest footprint possible with as much of decision making taking place in the hands of the individual.  The conservative belief is that individuals know the details of their circumstances and how to generate value better than an central authority can.  That is why he doesn't believe in government welfare programs, he lowers taxes, he cuts regulations, etc.

8.1.2   Bitcoin Cash \(BCH\) In 2017, Bitcoin users adopted an improvement proposal for Segregated  Witness \(known as SegWit, where transactions are split into two  segments: transactional data, and signature data\) through a soft fork.  SegWit made it possible to store transactional data in a more compact  form while maintaining backwards compatibility.  However, a group of  users had different opinions on how Bitcoin should evolve – and  developed a hard fork of the Bitcoin blockchain titled Bitcoin Cash.  Rather than implementing the SegWit changes, the developers of Bitcoin  Cash decided to simply increase the blocksize. When the hard fork  occurred, people had access to the same amount of coins on Bitcoin and  Bitcoin Cash.",1526227943

The point I’m making is every altcoin I have/had since 2013 still has the same btc value as it did in 2013/2014 with the exception of a few which are a lot higher in value now than it was then. I think the only ones that wasn’t was coinye and bbq but I’m happy to still have that one because it was fun. I feel I did better than if I would have just held btc. This is why I don’t agree with this at all. Any alt that isn’t dead has had huge USD gains but anyone who cashed out to USD regrets it. ,1526226485

"&gt; Who uses Windows encryption? lol

You. You said you used Windows 7 to make the 000000000.000 named encrypted file out of the JPG.

Either way you have used Window's crypto library, which could be compromized. The front -end app that you used just calls the Windows encryption system with an API. Not many encryption tools have all of it standalone, most use the default libraries which could be compromised.

&gt; Why would WD HDD tools take hours to not zero a disc? lol

Well a big disk does take long to erase, but if I remember correctly it only erases it totally if you overwrite it with 7 passes. And it needs to be random bits.

If Window's RNG is compromised, which I guess it could be, and it might not have 7 passes, just 1, then it didn't erased it completely, yet it could still take a lot of time.

When I erased my old hard disk it took me 2 days, it was a 1 TB hard disk and to overwrite it with 7 passes it takes 48 hours straight.

"&gt; It's time for P2P encrypted messaging: operated on a blockchain and not a private service.

Blockchain is not the right solution for every problem. Its immutable nature is good for messages requiring censorship resistance, but less favorable for the bulk of private messages which benefit most from qualities like Forward Secrecy and Deniability. Bitcoin excels at supporting the first category, especially when message content is meant to be accessible. Encrypted messaging usually falls into that second category, where it is preferable that the message fails rather than be read by the wrong party or provide strong evidence of the sender.

Deniable encryption schemes such as Ring Signatures can be implented on top of a blockchain, as is done with Monero. However, when maintaining a decentralized, immutable record is not vital to the underlying use case, it becomes a liability instead of a benefit. Recording such messages on a public chain results in additional metadata which can be used to reduce the overall security of a system. This is especially true against a global adversary.",1526226162

"&gt;Can someone please give me some context.

Since the earliest days of Bitcoin we knew we'd have **decimal** issues. Bitcoins were $2 for a long time. That meant .005 BTC was equal to exactly 1 cent, one penny. Today with a BTC price of say $9,000 that same .005 is worth $45. Big difference! We've seen BTC prices jump all over the place. What if one day a single Bitcoin costs 1 million dollars?? It's not impossible.

Many early adopters, people likely to hang around here are comfortable with math (and computers) so manipulating numbers and decimals is second nature. However, currency is meant for use by everyone, and I've personally got extended family that can't even convert a fraction. 

So there was much discussion on how to make lower decimal amounts more user friendly. After all names are so important some domain names sell for millions of dollars (like Vodka.com), just because humans like names when computers can't care less and prefer IP addresses. I won't go into the microbit, millibit proposals as the price is already so high. We're now contemplating what to call numbers at the farthest decimal right! It became sort of natural that the smallest unit was named one Satoshi. That's .00000001. However, many prices come in fractions: that will be $4.50 ma'am. People seem to handle and not mind no more than two decimal places. So it was proposed to leave the farthest right two numbers as the ""cents"" or fractional part of prices and name the whole unit ""bits"". So a price might be 5,000.25 bits. In whole units today that would be .00500025. So you see which looks better.

The argument now is do we call that ""bits"" or ""cash"" or something else? Personally I've got my preferences, but I won't add them because it makes more noise. I say we just *only* use satoshis. There seems to be most consensus around that. So that example price becomes 500025 satoshis. Simple! ",1526225317

"Increasing total TPS, allowing room for new ideas to grow on chain and providing guarantees to business both big and small that fees will always be low, thereby creating the value proposition that allowed Bitcoin to succeed before the blocks got full. 

Your analogy unfortunately sucks. Because people are using the  road. And there's tons of business opening up along the road.

A better analogy/question would be something along the lines of: 

Why does the local transit authority pay for busses that can seat 100 when they're only only filled with 20-30 people on average at a the time. Shouldn't they just buy can instead? The answer to that is of course no. Because there needs to be room for peak times. Rush hour. Large events being held that require mass transit. As well as population growth within a city.

Bitcoin was above $1,200 a few weeks ago. Today it's worth around $610.Clark Moody
In Bitcoin World, a week can be the equivalent of a decade.
At the start of December, Bitcoin topped out at over $1,200 as e-currency evangelists trumpeted the endless possibilities to be unleashed, comparing it to the breakthroughs not achieved since the start of the internet revolution. Bitcoiners claimed market disruption would bring credit card companies and payment platforms such as Western Union to their knees. Some even claimed that Bitcoin would supplant the U.S. dollar as the new global reserve currency. Adding more helium to the story, the Winklevoss twins of Facebook fame, not being shy about talking up their own book, predicted prices would rise to a staggering $40,000 per coin.

And from January to December 2013, markets obeyed with prices rising over 8,000 percent. In the mist of this hype, it appeared that the Bitcoin Revolution was on its way to transforming the economy, putting central bankers out of work and minting new e-currency millionaires daily. Bitcoin was priced for perfection. This past week, however, the market didn't stick to the script. Instead it began to challenge the rhetoric, knocking prices down as low as $535, a drop of about 55 percent from recent highs. The market has finally realized that hype alone cannot support lofty prices. Bitcoin is not a legitimate currency but simply a risky virtual commodity bet.

Flawed DNA

Since inception, Bitcoin has had a flawed DNA. It was dreamed up in a virtual world -- by computer geeks -- but was to be applied in the real world. Bitcoin is steep in Libertarian and anti-Fed dogma but weak in understanding of how global economics, central banking policies and financial markets function. The lifeblood of the global capital markets is money - greenbacks -- transactional currency that facilitates commerce. Virtual currency can create value and efficiency but it needs to be linked to fiscal and monetary policy. To assume currency can be computer generated, run in a decentralized manner and outside of the central banking system and controls is farcical and economically dangerous.

For currency to be adopted as a medium of exchange there has to be trust in the ability to honor the underlying obligation and the ability for central banking policy to control inflation. Historically the Fed has done a remarkable job maintain an average inflation rate of no greater than 2.5 percent. Given that two-thirds of U.S. GDP is driven by consumption, price stability in currency is essential. Without it, GDP growth is retarded and standard of living shrinks.

Even from a basic operational standpoint there are major flaws in Bitcoin structure. For example, it is assumed that miners will behave in a responsible way and not game the system for greater financial reward. Ignored is the human element and need for controls to keep pace as increases in market prices increase incentives to cheat. Fraud is also on the rise. Recently reported was that $220 million in Bitcoins were stolen and not recovered (Business Insider, 12/4/13).

Meantime, the inherent secrecy of coin ownership decreases the ability to prevent and potentially solve crimes. There is also little legal protection for investors and significant financial risk if an owner's hard drive gets corrupted, the computer is stolen or lost, rendering Bitcoin Wallets permanently lost. Should transfer instructions be incorrect and payments credited to a wrong account, Bitcoin transfers are not easily reversible. Moreover, the Bitcoin authenticity process also takes time which is not conducive to high volume retail sales where customers want to get in, pay for their goods and get out with no delay. In contrast, storeowners will be hesitant to have customers walk out the door with product, especially if authenticity process is not completed.

Unfit as a Currency

Bitcoin lacks the essential attributes that are needed to support a widely recognized transactional currency. If Bitcoin was allowed to proliferate as a currency it would produce greater economic uncertainty, reduced trade and lower individual standard of living.

Bitcoin has not taken off as a transactional currency and is further undermined by the fact that the majority of Bitcoin owners hoard e-coins. The more hoarded the less available to buy goods and services and spur economic growth.

In Bitcoin World it is not uncommon for prices to change by 20 or 30 percent in a given day, making Bitcoin toxic to economic growth. Price swings produce conflicting behavior. Retailers work on tight margins, sometimes as low as 10 percent. Such daily price fluctuations would eliminate all profit and inflict needless losses. Unless retailers want to be in the commodity trading business, they would not be interested in taking Bitcoin risk. At restaurants, Bitcoiners expecting coin values to drop might rush to pay for dinner even before the first entree arrives while restaurateurs would be motivated to delay payment until the drop occurred. If Bitcoin owners believe value would increase, they would hoard more coins and velocity of money would decline, harming economic growth.

In this Bitcoin World of currency uncertainty, guessing and risk, commerce would decline and bartering would increase. Naturally, as Bitcoin price swings increased, the number of businesses willing to accept e-currency risk would decline. This is why in recent weeks, as large price movements have occurred, we have seen more credible retailers saying ""No"" to Bitcoin.

High-Risk Commodity

Bitcoin has been trading like an out-of-control rollercoaster with price movements in 2013 climbing from $13 to $1,200 and then in only a week, careening down to a low of $535. This high-test virtual commodity has 8 times the volatility of the S&amp;P 500 and presents significant liquidity risk. There are now over 12 million Bitcoins outstanding. This volume of ownership has not been bear-market tested and if enough sellers try to run for the door it is not clear that existing infrastructure is capable of executing trade orders without significant time delays and price risk.

The buying and selling of Bitcoin is also controlled by only a handful of exchanges in places like China, Slovenia and Bulgaria. These exchanges are based on a peer-to-peer model and regulation is light with price disparities between exchanges commonplace. Exchange bankruptcies are not uncommon. In November, GBL, a Hong Kong based Bitcoin exchange closed it's doors, costing investors over $4 million. As a virtual commodity, it is a high-risk bet in a wild-west atmosphere, requiring speculators to stay cautiously alert.

China Pricked the Bubble

Every asset bubble has three stages; growth, maturity and pop. Growth started in 2011, followed by the maturity stage in 2013 and now the pop stage. The pin that burst the Bitcoin hyper bubble was China.

Ironically, China, the second largest economy in the world, helped push Bitcoin prices to the clouds and now is pulling prices back to earth. In the last week, China has delivered three knockdown punches. First the central bank forbade its banks from accepting Bitcoin as currency. Then, Baidu, China's Google equivalent, announced it would no longer process Bitcoins. Finally, China banned third-party payment companies from transacting with Bitcoin exchanges. This last announcement significantly weakens market liquidity for BTC China, the largest Bitcoin exchange. By voting ""No"" on Bitcoin, China fueled greater market skepticism. Markets have already responded by lopping off, at the low, $6 billion in Bitcoin investment value.

Other wealthy and powerful countries have taken a similar position, warning against the risks of this wannabe currency. Moves by European Banking Authority representing the largest economy in the world, France, the fifth largest economy and Norway, the wealthiest in Scandinavia all point to a growing number of roadblocks. Last month, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke indicated e-currency ""may have long-term promise"" but his statement was not a ringing endorsement for Bitcoin adoption. To the contrary, as large price swings continue, U.S. and other G20 countries will raise concerns, restrictions and begin clamping down on virtual currencies.

Bitcoin has seen an end to its hyper price run-up and can no longer support being priced for perfection. Unlike gold which has tangible value, Bitcoin is backed by hopes/dreams and only worth what people are willing to pay. As it becomes increasingly evident that Bitcoin will not be the global currency standard, but simply a novel idea that will be improved upon by more nimble competitors such as Litecoin, restrictions and new regulations will be imposed and prices will plummet.

I predict that Bitcoin will trade for under $10 a share by the first half of 2014, single digit pricing reflecting its option value as a pure commodity play. Miners/speculators will be best served to acknowledge the meltdown has begun, act quickly and take fleeting profit off the table.

Hey I'd be happy if it simply *started* thinking to begin with! :)

&gt;&gt;Haha, you're doing it again!

&gt;Ofc, I'm doing that again. Information is not property, it can't be treated like property. 

Again, that is a logical fallacy. Begging the question.

&gt;No one owns information - it's a legal axiom, 

Right, and it's a bad one. We have to evaluate the source of the axiom to see if it is valid and reasonable. You can't just pull an axiom out of your ass and declare it is a valid axiom. That's not how axioms work! :)

&gt;Who owns ""0""? No one

Duh. You can't copyright 0. You can't copyright ""information"" or ""ideas"" either. Only unique works of creative expression.

&gt;Then talking to someone is also a form of censorship cos he can't talk right back at u at the same time and cos he can't with others at the same time.

What? People can talk over each other. 

But if you're saying that a person shouting someone down who is trying to speak, so others can't hear them, is effectively a form of censorship, then yes, yes it is. 

That is correct. It's a very sad reality that is currently occurring on college campuses, and it's dreadful.

&gt;If u expand an abstraction, it becomes meaningless. 

???

&gt;I won't be calling for restricting people's access to Bitcoin in which ledger u put those hashes (at some point likely - complete files). 

I haven't called for that either. I called for people suffering consequences for their actions.

&gt;I'll just kill u, eat emotional cost and move on

This is how I can tell you believe in a right to privacy, and a right to use physical force to control the flow of information in certain cases. In this case, unconsenting videos of your mother in bed.

&gt;No good arguments so far.

That you are stubborn and resistant to confronting your own contradictions doesn't mean the arguments are bad! :)  

&gt;If I presume that information can be owned and I own copies of it, I would have a right to censor public square up to entering people's heads in search for this information. 

Nope! As discussed, you can just take action against those spreading your copyrighted work, of those spreading videos of your mother in bed.

You have already agreed to this. We are now just debating whether only the first party is liable, or if additional parties are *also* liable if they know that the material is copyrighted or is a private moment captured without consent.

&gt;I would have a right to try to destroy Bitcoin if someone would post some information that I presumably own on the ledger. 

I never said that.

&gt;And I would support a construction of totalitarian state which will ensure it

I never suggested that either. You don't need a large state or even a state at all for the above--as yourself indicated with your solution of personally acting against the person who distributed videos of your mother in bed.

I don't know if that's necessarily the most civilized solution, and I'd suggest that voluntary courts of common law would be a step up as a first resort, but those don't require a state at all either.",1526223170

"**English units**

English units are the historical units of measurement used in England up to 1826 (when they were replaced by Imperial units), which evolved as a combination of the Anglo-Saxon and Roman systems of units. Various standards have applied to English units at different times, in different places, and for different applications.

The two main sets of English units were the Winchester Units, in effect from 1495–1587, as reaffirmed by King Henry VII, and the Exchequer Standards, in effect from 1588–1825, as first defined by Queen Elizabeth I.

The units were replaced by Imperial Units in 1824 (effective 1 January 1826) by a Weights and Measures Act, which retained many but not all of the unit names and redefined many of the definitions.

Use of the term ""English units"" is ambiguous, as it is sometimes mistakenly used to refer to the Imperial units used in the UK, or to United States customary units, which retain some unit names of English Units, but has somewhat different definitions.

"""The early investor's interest is piqued when he sees a green candle, regardless of market conditions. Quickly, he logs into his exchange and hurriedly opens his 2FA. He's in. In the back of his mind he knows simply HODLing his projects with good fundamentals is the wisest long term solution to his fitness, but alas, desire can be stronger than logic. He sells at market price, speed is key. Tabbing over to the ShitCoin (SHT) he sees great demand with low supply, conditions are perfect, he believes, this is what he's been waiting for all season. The order book is green, the candles have yet outliers- even on minute-by-minute levels. He buys at market price. He sees now that in the last minute, it seems, he was the outlier. Yes, he was the one that overbought, triggering an onslaught of bot-sells, the price begins to drop now. Racing down below his buy-in, the exchange freezes although he can see the satoshis plummeting in the title of his tab. SHT is falling quicker than it rose, he tries to sell, but there is no demand. He sells at market. Glancing back to his previous tab, his project with great fundamentals is now experiencing a pump of it's own- the FOMO continues, on and on again. He rejoins with a more level head, and 10% less than he started with, but a lesson learned.. only to be repeated.

It amazes me how this trivial issue is getting blown out of proportion. Our take on this:

- We saw Electron cash using it, we thought it was interesting
- Cash sounds friendlier than ""bits"" and we are aiming for people not already in crypto.
- Bits is a measure of bandwith, doesn't sound related to money unless you already used Bitcoin before.

We are not forcing anyone to use it nor spend any time or money promoting it, it's our decision and we've seen an increase in other wallets and devs thinking it might be good to call them ""cash"".

At the end of the day, we think it's not that big of an issue, and we couldn't care less calling it one way or another: if we see a strong pushback or perceive confusion, it takes 2 seconds to call it bits or just remove the different format options altogether and stick just with 0.00000000 BCH.

It's beyond pointless and irrelevant. The guy has never invested in revolutionary tech in his life and, because of it missed out on huge opportunities like Google and Amazon before.

"Im not saying bitcoin will magiclly bring equality to the world. That is impossible whether under capitalism or communism.

Im saying this was the most egalitarian method to introduce a new form of money. If supply was limited from the begining that would have caused much higher prices and left early adopters (average people) with less btc therefore leaving more for corrupt institutions to buy up later with their massive amounts of fiat dollars.

I think you confuse the word egalitarian with equality.

On that note, inflation resistant bitcoin promotes monetary equality over time because it doesnt let prices rise faster than wages like fiat does. If anything, under bitcoin, wages will remain stable and prices will fall allowing people to feel the effect of natural wage increases with employers even raising wages, leaving people far better off over time.

So bitcoin was introduced in the most egalitarian way possible, and will not eliminate inequailty but will greatly reduce inequality over the next 50 years. What is bad about that.",1526220037

An argument from authority, also called an appeal to authority, or argumentum ad verecundiam is a form of defeasible argument in which a claimed authority's support is used as evidence for an argument's conclusion. It is well known as a fallacy, though it is used in a cogent form when all sides of a discussion agree on the reliability of the authority in the given context.

I am a freelancer and got my first ever crypto payment a few days ago. The guy wanted to pay in bitcoin. I wasn't comfortable with it because if I told him my address, he'd be able to see how much I have. So I decided to make a new wallet just for receiving his payment. Then I realized he'll still be able to see my original wallet because I'm going to end up transferring that money to my original address anyway, and all transactions are public.

What I ended up doing was using an exchange to receive his bitcoin, and then exchanging that to monero to hide my money.

Imo cryptocurrencies with public blockhains are stupid. It makes no sense that the whole world can look at your transactions and balance.

This maneuver saves blockspace on the blockchain by offloading complicated apps to developers who can write programs that run them off the blockchain.

"we can't, but Bitcoin Core most definitely could",1526216060
"1/ The main difference is that bitcoin smart contracts don't do loops. (I suppose this is also an answer to number 4.) Loops are a part of programming that allows your program to reuse code you've already used earlier in the program. For example, you might want a contract which has $100 to spend, and it is instructed to that send $10 of that money to someone once a week for ten weeks. In bitcoin you'd have to write a new contract once per week, because bitcoin contracts can't reuse code. In ethereum a single contract could send out that money every week no problem. Internally, ethereum can ""loop back"" to code it has already executed. Bitcoin can't.
2. Script is the language bitcoin uses to execute transactions and smart contracts, and it is also the language those contracts/transactions are written in. Solidity is the equivalent language used by Ethereum and Rootstock (and it has more features than Script because Solidity can do loops). Simplicity is a language that is supposed to be easier to write than Script, but it doesn't work on bitcoin directly; instead, it automatically rewrites every ""finished"" program in the Script language, that way you can write the contract in an easier language and let a machine turn it into the harder language for you.
3/ Bitcoin can do multiple layers but not in the same way. Bitcoin needs to use ""if/then"" commands in its smart contracts and all the layers either need to be run in parallel (if the user sends $10, then follow this set of instructions, or if he sends $100, then follow this other set of instructions) or you can have the first smart contract pass data on to the next smart contract, which is how the lightning network works. So bitcoin can indeed replicate the multiple layers of instructions that ethereum boasts of, but bitcoin does it slightly differently. And it can't do loops so you have to rewrite any code that you want to reuse.",1526215971

"He's been a part of creating something that no one else is anywhere close to having.  It's mind blowing how much of an impact this is going to have.  Sure there are these other attempts at aggregating other exchanges, and that's cool and certainly a good piece of the puzzle, but Liquid is going much much further than that.  With their multi crypto market and FX cross conversion in REAL TIME, and their Direct Market Access (even to smaller local fiats around the world) Liquid is going to be a one stop shop for all things crypto for the ENTIRE WORLD!  

They have also been the most professional and transparent team I have seen in crypto so far.  I know they've had problems and complaints with KYC, withdrawals, and user interface.  But they have addressed all these issues acknowledging completely that they are problems and are working to make the experience better.

UI has greatly improved, and they have admitted they still have further to go with that.  Plus they've hired some UI design guru to really improve this for their upcoming Liquid Platform.  

Their KYC is currently getting more recourses thrown at it right now due to their new one stop shop for ICOs (which is another amazing thing that they have rolled out). 

As far as withdrawals, their COO has publicly come out and said this is unacceptable and is making withdrawal a top Operations priority.  They're increasing their withdrawal frequency this week, and again medium term, and even more going forward long term.

See, most people are used to relatively instant withdrawals, which means those exchanges keep YOUR funds on hot wallets.  Quoine's CEO, Mike Kayamori, had publicly stated that the thing that keeps him up at night is not the progress and future success of the Worldbook, but that it's SECURITY.  Hot wallets are susceptible to hacks a breaches, which has happened with plenty of exchanges (I might be wrong here, but I think every exchange has been hacked except Quoinex or Qryptos).  That being said Quoine keeps your funds very safely in cold storage which means your withdrawals have to be manually executed.  It also means, having your funds in an exchange that strictly follows regulations and is committed through customer service improvements and strictly monitors potential account hacks, that it's safer for you to have and keep your funds with them then keeping them on your own wallet.  

Think about the MEW scams and hacks going on.  Think about how people can lose or damage their Ledgers.  Think about how people can misplace or throw away their paper wallets or forget their hardware wallet passwords.  There is virtually no customer support to resolve any of these issues.  You make one of those mistakes, and that's it, your funds are gone and it's your own fault and it sucks because there is nobody to help you fix your mistake.  I love binance for its ease of use, relatively high volume, and innovative ideas, but I don't feel safe keeping my crypto on their exchange, especially when they're hopping from country to country to avoid regulation which IS coming, so exchanges better be ready for that!  

Quoine is ready, they're more than ready.  In fact, some of there practices keep eventually turning into regulation standards.  I'm sure this will continue to happen too.  See, their team is full of people who have been in traditional finance, so they know what's coming and they know how to be ready for that.  And their product, Liquid, which is coming soon, will poise Quoine to be the leader in the next generation of crypto exchanges, financial services, and distributed ledger technology for both institutional and retail investors.

"I think the tweet is a bit taken out of context. If you read the whole thread, he's talking about how economically the #1 priority of all organizations is to profit for themselves, and how in case of Bitcoin, the only party this works successfully is the miners because the more miners try to profit for themselves the stronger the network becomes, whereas when it comes to non profits, the incentive is not as aligned as the miners. I think he does have a point. 

But that's not saying I don't think Bitcoin Cash fund shouldn't exist. 

I'm just agreeing that at the end of the day, the most ideal party that should fund the developers may be the miners. As can be seen from what happened with BlockStream and Lightning, when the primary party that funds the developers is incentivized to cripple the network because of its business model, crippled it will indeed become. I'm sure Blockstream didn't start out thinking ""Wouldn't it be so awesome if we fucked up Bitcoin network?"", but because of the misalignment in business model, these things manifest themselves eventually.

But then again, this is not absolute, and no one really has any idea how this will all play out, maybe miners paying developers can have another way of screwing up the network via some way we never thought of.

"Hi. Watched your video, it was interesting to hear your reasoning and views.

If I understand you correct, there has never been Communism in the world on any scale larger than small communes, and you view what is called the Communist regimes as State controlled Capitalism.

Most people and most conventional uses of the word communism will refer to what you call State Capitalism.

A person owning a machine and using it for mining means the person is making use of their labor and capital and keeping all the profits after taxation for themselves.

But as soon as someone pays anyone else a fixed salary to maintain the machines, or rents out the machines to others, then it goes from what you describe as Communism to what you describe as Capitalism. Am I understanding it correct?

If three people with different amount of machines works together, they split the profits based on the amount of labor that they do, not the amount of machines that they personally contribute.

Would it be fair to say that Bitcoin Cash offers people the ability to create wealth for themselves by being the owner of the capital (machine) and the provider of labor (maintenance), free from any direct control from corporations and states?

"Calling something insulting to your intellect is not the same thing as saying you are smarter than everyone else. I even said I'm just as failable as anyone else in my previous comment.

Never made that claim.

&gt;It means you took a risk, and anything beyond that is the ego talking and justifying the past.

You can say this for literally any ""speculative"" investment or ""bet"", even stocks.

&gt;I’ve made fantastic gains by playing this market and applying established trading principles to various coins and tokens, but I don’t for moment have the audacity to think that makes me more intelligent than anyone else, OR that I’m a good investor. I’m a lucky gambler, as most others are in this market. 

Do you not see how you are contradicting yourself? In the same breath you say you are using ""established trading principles"" whatever that means, and then you say you are just lucky. Why use any ""trading principles"" if it's just luck?


&gt;I’m a lucky gambler, as most others are in this market. 


So are you saying that currency and security trading (yes there are securities in crypto) is 100% luck simply because it's crypto? But anything in traditional markets is ""legitimate investing""?.

"soft fork:

&gt; A softfork is a change to the bitcoin protocol wherein only previously valid blocks/transactions are made invalid.  
&gt; https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Softfork

Please provide a specific example of a previously **invalid** block that made is **valid** under segwit. That is the only way to prove that segwit is a hard fork. I'll go over your arguments once more:

&gt; 1) Before SegWit activated, any network participant that saw an anyone-can-spend transaction could legitimately spend that transaction and still remain on the same chain as all other clients that agreed to these rules. [...]  If that spend is mined into a subsequent block.

If that spend is mined in a subsequent block, than that block is valid under the old rules, but invalid under the new rules. This perfectly fits the definition of a soft fork. A soft fork is a fork in which only previously valid transactions are made invalid, which is exactly what happens here.

&gt; 2) Prior to SegWit activation, all nodes could fully validate all transactions all the way back to the genesis block. This is the essential capability that allows Bitcoin's trustlessness. If SegWit were truly a soft fork and thus backwards compatible, this capability would remain for legacy nodes after SegWit activation.

Please provide A) an example scenario in which an old node is no longer trustless under segwit. B) use the definition of a soft fork to prove that this means that segwit is not a soft fork.

&gt; 3) SegWit activation redefines what ""blocks"" are (i.e. ""block weight"" and witness data segregation). This is a blatant expansion of previously existing rules, not simply a restriction. Therefore, SegWit is a hard fork. 

Please A) show that this process makes previously invalid blocks valid, thereby proving that segwit is not a soft fork by using the definition. B) explain to me what, from a technical standpoint, is the difference between namecoin merged mining (clearly not a bitcoin hardfork) and segwit (your claimed hardfork). Both processes commit one additional transaction in the bitcoin block, and use a side channel to communicate what the meaning of that data is. Old nodes don't see a difference, but the former is not a fork at all and the latter is a claimed hardfork. What am I missing?

For the record, I don't care whether segwit is a hard fork or a soft fork, but I can't let this amount of logical nonsense go unnoticed. If you think segwit is not a soft fork, use the definition to disprove that. If you merely want to claim that segwit is stupid and ugly, go ahead and claim that, but that doesn't make it a hard fork.",1526209659

R/iamverysmart is that way.

(Bonus question: And would it be ok for others to share it after that? Even if you believe there should be no law, should there be social pressure about such things?)

&gt;US Gov is unable to stop Bitcoin. I'd like to see them try. Popcorn is ready

They don't have to stop Bitcoin though. They can just go after YOU for what you put in the blockchain or how you use it.

This is even easier with public ledgers like Bitcoin, because every transaction is public and recorded forever.

Even if you use a coinmixer, that coinmixer could violate your implied contract to secrecy and then they and others could share all your past transactions, potentially linking it back to your name and making that information publicly available to anyone.

(You seem to be arguing that this would be ok?)

&gt;That's called access. U can have access to things u don't own like access to someone else's body or property on the basis of consent. 

And that's exactly how copyright works! :)

&gt;Property is not information. Information is not property. Apples and oranges

Once again this is a logical fallacy called ""begging the question"". We are arguing over *whether* information can be property. You can't say ""it can't be property because it can't be property."" That's not an argument, silly! :)

Regardless, in copyright you don't own ""information"". You own a unique act of creative expression. ""Information"" *about* that unique act of creative expression can be freely shared.",1526208932

To anyone reading/responding, I apologize if I misunderstand some technical details.  I’m semi-literate in tech and come from traditional investing/trading.  So for what it’s worth, consider this concern an outsider’s concern.

Here it is:

Q: What happens to BTC once the block rewards end? A: It dies a slow death.

Premises:

Almost all the mining is done by a few operators using absurdly expensive equipment.

They’re legendarily inefficient.  They have to buy entire cities-worth of electricity to run their farms and keep them cool.  

They drive the difficulty up to the point where anyone wanting to mine with general purpose hardware may as well throw their computer into an oven.

As a result, hardly anyone mines BTC, nor do they run a full node.  I know I don’t...

Conclusion:

The situation we have now lashes the health and speed of the network to the price of the asset.  These ASIC miners will continue spending the money to buy the energy to mine only so long as the price rises and the BR lasts.  They have no incentive to keep doing it for solely for tx fees if the price stabilizes.  The cost doesn’t justify the paltry gains.  Since few users solo mine or run full nodes, nobody will be able to replace them once they leave, and BTC becomes impossible slow and prohibitively expensive.",1526208707

Or that it had no intrinsic value a ect. And the occasional ""it's too expensive"", at the time it was around $300.  So eventually I just stopped talking about it and went quiet because people just didn't get it or understand. I only managed to convince a handful of people to buy a bit.

"The cringe... This is not a bank. Their core product is not even a banking, but rather lending (which doesn't require a banking licence in the EU). And it feels just sketchy if they advertise for borrowers and lenders on their main page and people taking out a loan pay ""from 1 %"" and people who stake their Bitcoin against a loan earn ""13 %"".

"&gt; Enough time has passed to say with absolute certainty that miners did not agree with BCH rules.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding you but are you saying that it is up to miners to decide on the rules of the game, and the rest of the ecosystem is to buy whatever results from that? I think it is - and should be - the other way around. The ecosystem as a whole decides what it wants through price mechanisms and this dictates what is profitable for miners to mine on. Currently, because BCH has a non-zero price, it is profitable for miners to dedicate some percentage of hash rate to mining on BCH. But, because BTC is valued more by the ecosystem, most of the hash rate is mining on BTC.

If the ecosystem as a whole decides that ""BTG is the true BTC"" (i.e. if price of BTG &gt; price of BTC) then miners will - I assume - dedicate most of their hash rate to BTG. I don't think that in the end miners really care the rules. And that's why I don't like the ""the only full nodes should be miners""-narrative by the way.",1526208066

"That is incorrect. The block size limit was supposed to be a temporary limit whilst bitcoin had zero value to stop a poison block attack , which is where an attacker could create a very large block which would take longer than 10 minutes to verify. Today no miner would allow such a block - it would be orphaned very quickly. There are some who say it was for flood control (ie spam) , this is partially true but again it would quickly become very expensive for an attacker to use this kind of attack vector. The 1MB limit was intended to be temporary , unfortunately BlockstreamCore has used this artifical 'problem' to create a proprietary 'solution'.

 Also, economics is not a hard science like physics, in fact I think they have seen the actual, real, progress in maths / physics / chemistry / engineering, ever since the scientific method came about, and they have tried to 'claim' the same certainty and absolute truthfulness for economics and have created more harm by doing so.

If from this point onwards you do nothing, you pay capital gains tax on that $2000 come 1 July. Even if the value of your crypto drops to $1000.

"Good points. Although in my opinion there won't be a bull run as like in 2017 May, because at that time the price of Bitcoin was increasing already. There was a sell-off at 2017 May 24th, which was probably the old *buy the rumor, sell the news* type of situation.

Overall we are in for a range, based on technicals when these kind of overextended run ups happen (BTC to $20 000, then a slow cool off) there tends to be a low volatility time.

Based on fundamentals, there's possibly *bearish news* as new regulations for coins and ICO's (because it's getting out of control at this point i am starting to see so many damn ads about ICO's) that ensue based on governments decisions. But there is also a lot of *bullish news* with new mainnets launching, new development and integration, new investors coming in. This will bring a sort of feeling that crypto is **definitely** here, but unsure if it increases at this current time, basically - uncertainty. Then uncertainty happens, we go into a range, triangle or huge bart formations, what ever you want to call it.

We accomplished our main goal already within a month after launch date and we are now pushing boundaries to expand our ecosystem of the XSN services and products.

Maybe I wasn't clear enough, but I meant trust in third parties, not trust as a whole since with bitcoin trust lies in the protocol (and the math and cryptography behind it).  
I don't think that what you said there shows that what I said is wrong. There are many ways to remove willingness to fraud, but only one so far that enables that without trust in a central authority.

"**Computer network**

A computer network, or data network, is a digital telecommunications network which allows nodes to share resources. In computer networks, computing devices exchange data with each other using connections between nodes (data links.) These data links are established over cable media such as wires or optic cables, or wireless media such as WiFi.

Network computer devices that originate, route and terminate the data are called network nodes. Nodes can include hosts such as personal computers, phones, servers as well as networking hardware.

"I don’t deny for a second your remarks on lapses in knowledge from previous “experts” about new and innovative technologies/industries, but we both know my post wasn’t meant to be argued against in such a narrow vacuum. Any point starts to crumble when picked at in such a particular way. I was commenting on the hive mind thought patterns, not necessarily trying to do a deeper comparison between the knowledge/sentiments of the people vs. Warren Buffet.

I agree very much with your notion too extrapolating on Thiel’s comment. Innovation paves the way for new geniuses in new industries, but my whole point I made is that the power of the hive mind seems to think they know more than a successful investor with a proven track record just because they speculated bitcoin would go up in price at some point in the future from their purchase date, and that speculation paid off. 

If we look at it through that lens, very few people on reddit are actually “investing” with a sound strategy. Most of what the hive mind does is really “speculation”, and that funnily enough is also a case of Apples and Oranges as you used as well. 

I’m not saying I’d blindly take everything Buffet has to say as gospel, but is it so unwise to think about what he’s saying through his perspective to lend some light as to why he’s making such remarks?

I have profited handsomely by specifically ignoring his straight up advice on Bitcoin. I basically rationalized that he hadn't done is research and that really didn't understand the technology nor that it potentially represents a huge paradigm shift in finance. Bitcoin is a blackswan to not just ordinary people, but also Warren Buffet.

Also he's an investor, not a much of a currency trader. So it's a bit apples to oranges anyways. 


Peter Thiel said ""The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won't make a search engine. And the next Mark Zuckerberg won't create a social network. If you are copying these guys, you aren't learning from them."" and I'll expound on that and say the next Warren Buffet won't be an investor in the traditional finance system.

"&gt; the whole point of bitcoin and crypto is decentralization and removal of trust.

you're wrong here, the whole point of bitcoin is creating an a economic incentive system to remove willingness to fraud the system hence creating a trust in the said decentralized system.  

Satoshi predicted that in this [quote](https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/bitcointalk/188/): 

&gt; The design outlines a lightweight client that does not need the full block chain.  In the design PDF it's called Simplified Payment Verification.  The lightweight client can send and receive transactions, it just can't generate blocks.  It does not need to trust a node to verify payments, it can still verify them itself. 
&gt; 
&gt; The lightweight client is not implemented yet, but the plan is to implement it when it's needed.  For now, everyone just runs a full network node. 
&gt; 
&gt; I anticipate there will never be more than 100K nodes, probably less.  It will reach an equilibrium where it's not worth it for more nodes to join in.  The rest will be lightweight clients, which could be millions.
&gt; 
&gt; At equilibrium size, many nodes will be server farms with one or two network nodes that feed the rest of the farm over a LAN

so your point that he expected everyone to use their mining node he wouldn't have said what I quoted above, therefore your argument is invalid _if_ you chose to use Satoshi's quotes or the whitepaper. 

the full node you're talking about is running a node that downloads the whole blockchain and monitors each block hence why they're maintaining a = 1 MB blocksize. 

SPV is not downloading the whole blockchain, only the headers. from the whitepapre: 

&gt; it is possible to verify payments without running a full network node. A user only needs to keep
&gt; a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying
&gt; network nodes until he's convinced he has the longest chain, and obtain the Merkle branch
&gt; linking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in. ""  
&gt; ",1526203075
"And that's the least of their cognitive dissonance - take for example the supply: it's called ""digital silver"" because it has 4 blocks in 10 minutes with the same block reward instead of X0.25 like it somehow makes it more ""silvery"" to have Bitcoin with four times the supply. Changing the reward like most all of LTC changes aren't for technical reasons but for marketing.",1526203064

However, things are really hard in Iran \(have been for years\), and with the new sanctions coming up, it'll get even harder. That ridiculous regime has a strong bind over the people, not only economically but particularly psychologically as well. Last I checked, Bitcoin was selling for about 1.5x on localbitcoins for Iran. However, you'd have to be pretty savvy with respect to IT because the f'n mulahs have pretty much tried to ban the entire internet to the people.

"You are wrong, my friend!

Since March '18, Litecoin netowrk decreased minimum fee to 1 lite/b (also before the limit was just arbitary). So now it has significally lower fees than BCH. Here you are example of transaction sent via Electrum-LTC (with Loafwallet its same): https://chain.so/tx/LTC/a98a95f97d9537e4b123fe11b3c046fca438de2efbdc169e6b3f6cb8ee95c030

Total fee paid: 0.00000268 LTC or $0.00036716.

And that with fee 2 lites/byte, so it can be 2x more lower. That actually means that that LTC has x10 lower fees than BCH. But LTC also has 4x faster blocks, which is much more suitable for microtransactions.

Same with your math:
Litecoin: 0.226 kb * 0.00001 LTC/kb * $140 = $0.0003668 in fees
Bitcoin Cash: 226 bytes * 1 sat/byte / 100,000,000 (divide by this to convert satoshis to BCH) * $1460 = $0.0033 in fees

"## Pro  &amp; Con Contest 

Greetings everyone and welcome to the first *Pro &amp; Con Contest*, [as announced last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencyMeta/comments/8hqynj/introducing_the_weekly_procon_contest/). In it, contestants will compete against one another to present the best arguments for or against a coin, token, or project. The end goal is to stimulate healthy debate and hopefully learn true knowledge from this evaluation process. 

**General Details**

*  u/CryptoCurrencyMod will officially represent the entire mod team in administering the contest. It will be posted and stickied inside the Skeptics thread so it can thrive off a serious discussion environment which already exists.

* Duration will range from one week to two weeks depending on the topics and how much past participation there is

* Arguments presented in this contest will be considered as material for r/CryptoWikis. Select contestants may also be offered wiki editor or mod positions at r/CryptoWikis.

* As mentioned in the main text of this thread, this is a pilot project so expect the rules, schedule, and format to change over time. If these first and second contests are not successful in terms of participation, either major changes wil be made or the entire project could be canceled.

* Anyone not interested in the contest can just ignore it and use the Skeptics thread as they did before.

**Rules**

* Anyone can enter. This also applies to users who do not meet the karma and age requirements. Arguments/comments submitted by these users will be removed by the AutoModerator until manually approved, depending on what there quality is.

* Arguments must be submitted in response to the correct sub-thread or will not be accepted. 

* Ad hominems, profanity, or abusive language of any kind will disqualify an argument unless the contestant revises it.  This behavior will not be tolerated in the lower-level commentary either.

* Contestants may revise their arguments until the end of the contest, which could be one or two weeks. After this time window has ended, the Skeptics thread will be locked for judging.

* Winners will be awarded and recognized with trophy flairs, such as the ones issued in the banner and theme contests. Contestants who win two or three times will receive a higher trophy, ie silver or gold rather than bronze. Contestants who win over three times, will just have their text flairs updated to show their win score. The trophy flairs are not mandatory. No monetary prizes will be given.

**Topics and Sub-Thread Links**

PhantomMod here. As stated in the title, the topics for this first contest are Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin. Yes, in the announcement thread I said there would only be one topic and it would be EOS. However, due to new ideas I came up with, scheduling issues, etc., I decided to choose multiple coins which were established and in their own competitive category, more or less.  My theory is if we include multiple competing coins in one contest, there could be a greater confluence of opinions which will lead to a richer debate, hopefully not without too much fighting...  That's just one reason but I'll explain my new idea further and propose a future schedule in a meta thread maybe later on today.

So finally without waiting any longer, here are the argument threads:

Bitcoin(BTC):

* Pro-Arguments
* Con-Arguments

Bitcoin Cash(BCH)

* Pro-Arguments
* Con-Arguments

Litecoin(LTC): 

* Pro-Arguments

Moreover, if/when your card expires you can expect a call from your institution asking you for a new number, or your card number might get stolen, leading you to gave to rearrange all your recurring payments, or you might need to switch banks.

"To be more clear, the link I provided gives four clear examples of how it can be easily seen that SegWit is not a soft fork as claimed. In our discussion since, you yourself have provided *two more such examples*. You've not disputed any of these factual points, yet you now just hand wave a vague, incorrect assumption and proclaim SegWit is a soft fork.  

Any BTC user running a non-SegWit client that wants to continue using BTC trustlessly ""cares"", because after SegWit activation they are no longer able to do so (but may not even understand this do to the Anyone Can Spend chicanery). They lost previously existing (and central to Bitcoin) functionality through no changes they made of their own: clear hard fork behavior. Morevover, if they exercise their right to spend a SegWit Anyone Can Spend transaction to any random destination address their choosing (because this behavior is completely allowed under their previously existing consensus rules), the result is block chain fork (again as a result of no changes they made of their own). Therefore, any such result chain fork is the result of SegWit manifesting its hidden hard fork character.",1526201469

Confirmations number is pointless, litecoin offer 4x faster block but for ~~the same~~ equivalents security you still need to wait an hour (equivalent 6conf bitcoin).

Same goes for ETH blocks are even faster, you need much more of them to equal the same security than bitcoin.

&gt;&amp;gt; It is literally why bitcoin has invested in the first exchange value.

&gt;I dont care, exchanges still want 6 conf. An hour! 

As explain above then they will need to wait an hours with liquid too.

Likely (much) more if liquid is supported by less hash power.

&gt;Do you understand how thats a long time when trading something as volatile as bitcoin?

I do.

Though liquidity is already provided by their customers, I do there is much need for liquid.

Spread between exchange mostly come form local difficulty to convert FIAT/cryptocurrencies. Liquid will bring no help for that.

Yes.

"It's easy. Roger has always misunderstood and constantly misrepresents the Austrian Economic theory that he claims to support and has quoted incorrectly on occasion.

Being a proper Store of value was an explicit part of the economic origin of bitcoin. The Austrian theory called Menger's Regression theorem explains precisely  where money comes from, and if you listen to Roger tell the story, he'll say that it's really important for money to be a transactional currency first and foremost, not a store of value. (Paypal is more important than gold.) Sadly for all of us, he's always misunderstood this and no one can tell him otherwise because he literally thinks he's the smartest person around. 

The very Austrian economists he quotes did not agree with him at all... You can read it for yourself here: https://mises.org/library/origin-money-and-its-value (Next to last paragraph, it's clear that money has to be a store of value first and foremost.)

Satoshi and many in bitcoin longer than Roger knew this all along and thankfully the devs realized that bitcoin being a store of value is all-important for its success. Just think about it though; if bitcoin goes to $0, another coin could easily overtake it, or faith in cryptocurrencies as a whole could be lost for decades... But if we just lose the payment rails? That's like switching paypal for amex or something... Very minor in comparison. Consumers won't care if bitcoin gets new payment rails... As long as their value stored in the system is safe.

Now, back on topic. 

Bitcoin Core behaves in ways similar to post-modern totalitarian, technocratic, socio-political agendas, e.g., using censorship, character assassination, and avoiding discussion of science, facts, economic fundamentals, or history. They, like SJWS, are also extremely bigoted. In our case, the chide and smear Bitcoin (BCH) at every turn. They embrace allllll kinds of altcoins and ""blockchain tech"" but not the version of Bitcoin that actually works like Bitcoin, i.e., as money. 

Also like SJWs, Core promotes a fringe interpretation of reality. In the case of Bitcoin Core, they REEEEEEE at the notion that Bitcoin is an electronic cash system. Their actions suggest that they think Bitcoin should be useful, in the present, only on exchanges as a base-pair for trading tokens and then ""in 18 months"" as a settlement layer for banks and a maybe also a payment system for the little guy via a rube goldberg machine ironically called ""Lightning"" that will have very high fees to open and close channels and requires a master's degree and something called a watchtower to operate.

In times of strife rich people usually put more money into gold, or art. Investments they expect to stay stead or even appreciate.

Bookmakers always do well in a recession because you suddenly have more people surviving paycheck to paycheck (if they've even got a job) and they just need that 1 big win to see them alright (the 1 big win never comes, or gets bet again)

Not sure about a specific coin (I guess PWC is Vechain), but Deloitte, KPMG and PWC are certainly moving around and exploring the markets. Guess they see IBM being successful with Stellar and have fomo :-)

In itself I don't think those 'big four' names have much to bring to the table. I've worked with their consultants and mostly they are sharply dressed, 'fast' people, all about looks and shoes and not so much content.

I don't even think they deserve the title 'big four', merely a lot of baked air.

Just like with Moody's and S&amp;P being 'best of class' rating agencies and look where it got us in 2008.

But :

It is how the world (unfortunately) still works. Banks and governments do attach value to big names, fooled by marketing and edgy powerpoint pitches. Reality is not all about merit, it's also about laziness and simply going with a well known 'reputable' name.

So in that sense they do bring value to crypto via adoption and getting their network of big bank and corporate clients onboard the crypto train.",1526197282

"&gt; Tell me exactly why you think it's 'easy peasy' to bribe 1K+ miners? If I spent $20K on my HW I sure wouldn't mess with risking Bitcoin going to $0 value.

""Hey miners. I know a way to get 100k free BTC""

Good security analysis focuses on the ""how"", not the ""why"". Maybe I just hacked some miners with my computer skills. Or china did.

&gt; Also why do you think the word won't get out that there are now more than 21M coins just because everyone runs an SPV node? You don't think there are dozens of watchdogs looking at the network?

Since everybody runs an SPV node, the miners can just refuse to serve you the block(s) that prove their fraud. And even then, what are you going to do? Spend months trying to convince the world they need a different currency? Look at Venezuela and Zimbabwe to see how hard that is.

&gt; Also why do you think if I run a full node I can stop the colluding miners? How exactly do I do that? 

This one is easy. If you run a full node, the above described fraud does not work *on you*. Clearly, if everybody runs a full node, there is no point in attempting the fraud because there are no targets that can be defrauded. But if a large number of users run SPV wallets, than there are tons of targets that the miners can try to defraud. As I said, every additional node improves network security by some degree. Even if the impact of your specific node is unmeasurable, the effects of thousands of nodes are not.",1526197164

If you later sell your etherium for some other currency after etherium has dropped in price... You can offset this against the $2,000.

It's quite important to hurry the fuck up and make a few trades to realise your loss in this tax year if you made some big gains earlier... And see value drop now... Just move from crypto a to b (and back to a if you like).

So I guess, given the fact that Bitcoin uses metric subdivisions anyway, it also makes sense to use metric prefixes for those subdivisions.

First we have the number of people on the planet.  I will call that X. 
Now obviously everyone on the plant can’t invest in crypto.  The people who can’t invest are E. 
So we subtract E from X.  
Now what we are left with S.  

S represents everyone on the planet who possesses the capacity to invest.  

Are more potential investors in or out?
Fearful or Greedy?
I commonly hear people who are invested say, “only 5% of the worlds population are in crypto.

"This is kind of what tether (USDT) is for though. As far as safety, use 2FA and buy a ledger (or similar wallet) if you have coins that you are trading and/or don’t want to take off of the exchange. 
Are you new to crypto? I’m not asking to be disrespectful at all, I’m just trying to get an idea of what you know/don’t know about crypto so I can explain this in a way that’ll make sense. To new people, it’s overwhelming so if you are new I get it. I was in that position 2 years ago. You can also use lite coin (LTC) for transactions instead of btc since it is a bit faster to send/receive. ",1526195010

"Yeah he's all over the place, particularly though on CSW relevant posts, and that's where he's at his most nonsensical. This post has no chance given what are, if I had to guess, many sock puppet accounts all pushing the same ""Peter Rizun is toxic and Bitcoin Unlimited is the next Blockstream, and anyone who doesn't support CSW is either a paid blockstream shill or a paid Bitcoin Unlimited shill"" narrative. It'll be interesting to see if they actually manage to pull off pushing such an absurd narrative without the censorship blockstream had on their side. If they do succeed, it'll be more of a failure of reddit as a platform, I think, than anything else. People are lazy and don't question things near enough, sure, but it seems like reddit almost encourages manipulation...",1526194836
"I get that it technically functions the same, however from my understanding it does alter how the data is interpreted by moving the signature data outside it’s normal position.

&gt;Any supposed change in value of signatures cannot apply uniquely to segwit when the same methods can be used to communicate data about bitcoin transactions without any change to the block structure.

As I’m not totally familiar with this, I need to look further into this statement.",1526194827
