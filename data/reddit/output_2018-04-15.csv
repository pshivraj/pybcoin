"Have you really read it? 

&gt;   Motivation

Satoshi Nakamoto's original Bitcoin implementation provided the nSequence number field in each input to allow replacement of transactions containing that input within the mempool. When receiving replacements, nodes were supposed to replace transactions whose inputs had lower sequence numbers with transactions that had higher sequence numbers.

In that implementation, replacement transactions did not have to pay additional fees, so there was no direct incentive for miners to include the replacement and no built-in rate limiting that prevented overuse of relay node bandwidth. Nakamoto removed replacement from Bitcoin version 0.3.12, leaving only the comment, ""Disable replacement feature for now"".

Replacing transactions with higher-fee transactions provided a way for spenders to align their desires with miners, but by the time a Replace-by-Fee (RBF) patch was available to re-enable replacement, some receivers had begun to expect that the first version of a transaction they saw was highly likely to be the version of the transaction to be confirmed, and so some users advocated that replacement should be disallowed.

To address those concerns, a variation on RBF was created that required that the replacement transaction pay all of same outputs as the original transaction in equal or greater amount. This was called RBF First Seen Safe (RBF-FSS), and the original RBF became known as full-RBF. Although agreeable to recipients who relied on the first-seen version of a transaction, each use of RBF-FSS required adding an extra input to a transaction, resulting in wallets being unable to use it if they had no spare inputs, a loss of privacy when inputs from different origins get used in the same transaction, and a wasteful increase in transaction byte size.

Opt-in full-RBF uses Nakamoto's original semantics (with a slight tweak to allow locktime users to opt-out) to signal that replacement is possible, providing first-seen users with the ability to ignore those transactions while also allowing for the efficiency benefits of full-RBF.

There are no known problematic interactions between opt-in full-RBF and other uses of nSequence. Specifically, opt-in full-RBF is compatible with consensus-enforced locktime as provided in the Bitcoin 0.1 implementation, draft BIP68 (Relative lock-time using consensus-enforced sequence numbers), and draft BIP112 (CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY).

"&gt; The fork is only the BCH chain?

Yes.

&gt; Will I receive an equal amount of BCH on the forked chain? I.e I own 2 BCH, will I get 2 of the new version to? Or will I have to choose which one I want?

You will recieve an equal amount, but it is very likely that the old chain will no longer be mined, have no economic value and that you would have to make a custom wallet yourself to access them.

&gt; Depending on the outcome of question 2. Will it be favorable to Shapeshift my other crypto (BTC, ether etc.) into BCH to capitalize on the fork?

It might be favorable, but for a differe nt reason than the one you assume. After the fork, Bitcoin Cash will have demonstrated, in practice, without doubt, that its community is unified in the direction of larger blocks and that it thus has the capability to HardFork when useful, instead of being limited to SoftForks due to underlying conflicts.

This signals that BitcoinCash will rapidly upgrade as needed to gain the features that the market actually wants, which would bring adoption and long term valuation.

Simply put; we are not forking, we are using a hard fork to perform a hard **upgrade**.",1523861308
"Comment above is deleted, but I assume you mean bitcoin will make loans obsolete.

Even on a personal level there are certain items that generally go *up* in value, such as real estate, and are also rather expensive. Similar to obtaining bitcoin *now*, while it's cheap(er), it is also prudent to buy a house *now*, while it is cheap(er) than it will be in 20 year's time (typically).

"&gt; I don’t understand why you are so vehemently defending the platform and the world of CFDs. Makes me think you are a shareholder or brand ambassador. 

I’m not defending them, I’m explaining why it isn’t a CFD, don’t fucking use etoro, that isn’t my point at all, I lead with that if you bothered to read my first comment. They have awful spreads and don’t let you withdraw your coins. When finance illiterates try to explain stuff they clearly don’t have any experience with, you are stepping out of the world of crypto and into the financial markets when you start talking about brokers like etoro, and just because you understand one doesn’t mean you understand the other. 

In addition to this, you’ve spent this entire time shitting on CFDs because you can’t withdraw stuff but I don’t think you understand the role CFDs actually have, they aren’t some scam, they just serve a more niche role. That role is for leverage and margin trading, very often for specifically daytraders to avoid fees. Just because CFDs aren’t for #hodling doesn’t mean they are scam, hell Bitmex is pretty much the gold standard for crypto traders and they also offer CFDs. This is because people who trade CFDs generally aren’t concerned with withdrawing anything since they aren’t holding for longer than hours or days. You’d be insane to daytrade on etoro due to the spreads, though.

Anyway, I’ll leap around to the comparison I made earlier that you didn’t answer, in hopes that maybe you missed it and aren’t just illiterate in the world of financial trading. If I buy shares in a company through a broker who backs it with the underlying asset, yet doesn’t allow me to withdraw the share myself, am I trading the share or am I trading a contract for the difference in the share value when I decide to sell it? This is the important point, because that is the term you are trying to apply to etoro.

If it isn’t a margin or leverage trade, then 95% of time it isn’t a CFD trade.",1523860677
"I think this is really cool in theory, but ultimately it's going to be hard to convince anyone to use a social network that requires you to spend money. I'm no crypto expert but here is my take on the sort of changes that might make a system like this appealing to normal people. 

The main issue is to disassociate from currency. Many people will be turned off by the idea of spending money to utilize social media, even if it's just tiny amounts many people will feel guilty about it because it feels like wasting money. The solution to this is to make the system not use money- make it have it's own tokens that have such little value they are easy to acquire and people won't feel like  This means not using the BCH blockchain, nor any other cryptocurrency's blockchain. It would need to be it's own blockchain. The tokens should not feel like money, maybe call them 'Contribution Credits' or something like that (this would be a reference to mining which I'll get to in a minute). The next major thing to do would be to discourage the token's use as a currency, to prevent it from gaining a market value which would bring us back to the first issue. Perhaps a good way to go about this would be to make transactions that move credits to a different address require a fee rate 1000x greater, with an exception only for moving tokens freshly acquired by a miner. The exception makes it so that faucets for new users to collect their first tokens from are reasonably possible still.  This also would strongly encourage users to mine their own tokens which brings me to my next item... Significant changes to block reward and blocks. Social media moves fast, it can't wait 10 minutes to confirm. Blocks would need to be much more frequent to keep up with people's need to communicate quickly. This would also have the side effect of giving independent miners more chances to mine a block and make their own tokens- this would reduce the need for mining pools (but I'm sure pools would still be more efficient for most people wanting tokens so they can use the network). Another thing would be to make the block reward somewhat proportionate to the difficulty (higher difficulty = more mining = more adoption = more users that will need tokens to start using the platform). This would also mean removing the cap on the number of tokens created, there is no need for deflation since it shouldn't be treated as a currency. The last thing would be to make it reasonable to run a node without the full chain history. As mentioned in a few places on this page, social media will generate far too much information to reasonably store redundantly across every network node. This would have to be addressed by allowing people to easily run nodes that only keep a specific amount of block history and without having to download the chain from the beginning. Nodes that skipped downloading the chain from the beginning wouldn't be able to fully verify that their chain is authentic, but the operator should be able to tell pretty quickly they're on the right chain when they can write messages and other people see them; since the system isn't a currency verifying the entire chain should be less critical. Obviously there would be *some* nodes that store the full chain for archival purposes, but it would not be very common given the tremendous size the chain would grow to.

There are probably a number of issues with this I'm not really seeing, but this is just my take on what could make a system like this feasible.

TL;DR:  
- Has it's own blockchain  
- Discourage usage as a currency
- High fees for moving tokens to different addresses (except when freshly mined)
- More frequent blocks  
- Block reward proportionate to mining difficulty  
- No token production cap
- Pruned nodes",1523860677

"Lol, probably the most ambitious project in the entire crypto\-sphere, but yeah... it's dead! /s",1523860455
"Yea thats true for purposes of inflation.

But im talking about bank runs.

If I deposit 10k in a bank, they then turn around and lend out 9k of that to someone else. They replace that 9k in my bank account with ""bank credit"". At this point instead of holding 10k in trust for me they owe me 9k. They have at that point turned an asset (my 10k) into a liability (they owe me 9k).

This works fine as long as I dont withdraw more than 10% of my account. If I do then they need to pay out using money sourced from someone elses deposit and they dont make money charging interest this way.

So if I deposit 10k and then send it all to a bitcoin exchange they are then stuck with money tied up in a loan while someone elses deposit has paid me out. This means they are making half of the profit they should be had I just left my money in the bank.

Withdrawing cash affects the banks level of vault cash. But wiring money out of the bank directly affects their profitability. The first scenario (if 10% of their deposit holders withdrew all their cash to buy btc) would cause a bank run and cash withdrawals would be blocked. The second scenario (if 10% of their deposit holders wired all their money out) would cause a loss in profitability and a fall in their share price. 

The second scenario would take 50% of deposit holders removing all their deposits to cause a bank failure. While the first scenario would only require 10% of depositors withdrawing cash to cause a bank failure.

This means that banks operating in cash based societies like india, africa, SE asia etc are more fragile to bitcoin, while western banks have more time but wouldnt be far behind. 

My post is reffering to the majority of the world that operates in a cash based society. This also explains the war on cash. Eliminating cash in commerce reduces the fragility of banks.

I'm unsure of what that is supposed to mean. Monero is fungible because it means that 1 monero will always be 1 monero and there's no way to ""taint"" a monero. There are no blacklisted moneros and people can use it freely without fearing being spied upon.

If Monero may raise flags because it's fungible then using dollar bills may raise flags as well. By the way, the whole idea of Bitcoin is to be censorship resistant, so what ""raise flags"" should even mean?

If being fungible means raising flags, and raising flags means a lost in value as a fungible cryptocurrency, does that mean that we are supposed to advance to the future without having a fungible digital cash? I for one don't think such outcome is good for the world.

The current fragmentation is a huge weakness of the ecosystem, not strength, crypto will never be able to scale to billions in this way.

Exchanges would become legacy, because fragmentation is very very expensive. Pegging would enable closed loops when required, no need for alts. The main challenges are scalling and hooking up big data centers to maintain the infrastructure. If telcos (and banks why not?) enter into mining, then it becomes a serious business. We are speaking about over 50K large data centers that can maintain the infrastructure of a crypto scalled to billions. They can presure governments to open up.

In a populous, pluralistic, expansive country, it becomes a bureaucratic nightmare, easily plagued with demagoguery, party politics, and a lack of fundamental trust in a system that doesn't deserve any. 

What is often underestimated, is how apathetic and illiterate (figuratively) people are, because there are too many things they'd rather take interest in apart from politics. If pushed to politics, they'd prefer to understand it in the simplest way possible, without the nuance or sophistication it will demand from them. Now imagine that with cryptos. You have all these basic bitch normies who can't even operate their computers unless it was significantly dumbed down, what is cryptocurrency that has already been commented upon by people whose opinions many people would adopt as their own rather than forming their own opinions from their personal understanding of the issue? 

The U.S. government has people who are careful of it, yes, but there was also a bill *months* ago designed to combat money laundering and fraud because that's the only thing they saw cryptos (or just bitcoin, at least) as being used for. I don't think they'll change their mind definitively unless everyone and their mothers regularly use cryptocurrency for their intended, legal uses, and this may be hindered by the fact the basic fact of everyone's apathy and actual lack of utility on the developers' side.

"As of now there are not too many exchanges that enable you to buy crypto from fiat, so this is still huge advantage (even though binance will also deploy fiat-to-crypto soon) and will hopefully bring many new customers. The main advantage of Coss for me is that they try to be as compliant as possible when it comes to governmant regulations, so they won't have to suddenly shut down fiat again because the government interferes. I have big hopes for the project long term. Not only will the value of the coin increase with more customers on the exchange, but also will the fee split be much more substantial. You can estimate your expected fee split at pages like http://www.coss-stats.com/ . I think it is a good investment still. If they will really be in the game for long term with a large userbase then having a bag of COSS will return you great rewards over time (think about the compounded interest).

"They aren’t trading the contract anymore, they are selling you the asset based on the cost they are paying for it from an exchange. There is an internal wallet function for these cryptos, they’re just left in storage untill they release a wallet function (I assume they haven’t done this yet for the same reason withdrawals take like 5 days, they still want some control over what goes in and out).

The reason the term matters is because what you say here is patently, and most importantly, legally incorrect

&gt; The ultimate problem I have with eToro is that they fail to explain that you do not as a trader / investor own the underlying asset. That in my eyes is poor trading practise.

You do own the underlying asset, that’s why it is not a CFD, because they’re selling cryptos and not contracts based on cryptos. You not being able to withdraw the asset doesn’t actually mean you don’t own it, although that may seem counter-intuitive.

It’s not uncommon for shares, which is where the practice comes from. Crypto-enthusiasts just tend to have a different relationship to brokers since crypto exchanges work quite differently.

You can’t leverage an etoro crypto trade, unlike their other assets and stocks, so it seems weird to accuse it of being a CFD. That’s like the one reason to use CFDs.",1523858812

"That's actually a valid point.

My reason for being neutral / pro is not that I think it's the best, but at the least it's a pretty solid coin :

---&gt; Subjective, but I find the branding and naming cool. Don't underestimate this aspect; why you pay 50% more for an Apple, mainly branding

---&gt; Positive or negative, the name is out there. Most in crypto heard of Verge and its bumps in the road, but still, brand awareness is pretty high

---&gt; Really fast; don't know that much about specific technicalities but when transferring from exchange to wallet it was hella fast

---&gt; Big supply, good for mainstream adoption, no 10k units which deter regular folks buying them

---&gt; No pre-mine

---&gt; Optional privacy. Yeah I know about all the technical debates and stuff and for sure it can get improved (Ring signatures coming I understood), but still; even in it's current state it does offer something others don't. Yeah, every coin could use Tor, but adoption is also about ease of use and Wraith provides that with the click of a button. And again, Wraith, pretty cool branding.

---&gt; The dev had some minor infractions with the law, but to put him away as one big con artist is jumping to conclusions in my view. Also simply from a 'hunch' watching his youtube videos I think he's a pretty cool guy. Probably not the best coder (going by your link), so being lead dev may be sub-optimal, but the lead of the coin in general seems to be in pretty good hands. Ccommunication could have been better and there are other points of improvement but on te whole he seems like a no bs kinda guy. Could be wrong, but just don't think he's a scammer. If so he probably would have pre-mined a fortune for himself, or would have asked for donations in BTC or Eth, he didn't.

These are some points that pop to mind. So it's not revolutionary or anything, just a pretty solid alt. Nothing close to the Carmageddon and Hitler-level disaster many make it out to be. Not sure why they do; it's almost like some herd mentality, like everyone picking on one guy during school lunch break. Really pathetic.

"Well, Vinyl records are actually superior to both CD's and MP3's which is why the greatest DJ's in clubs still use Technics 1210s.

Do we actually need multiple music platforms delivering the same content?  The whole point of the entire internet re-engineering project neckbeards are calling Web 3.0 is to remove all those gatekeepers that do little but cream off the top.  

The real breakthrough in Bitcoin is not the blockchain technology itself, but the system of consensus based governance behind it that ensures no one person or group of people have the power to corrupt the system.

Development happens more cautiously to ensure no mistakes are made, which in turn means the technology remains robust and anti-fragile.

This is far more about the integrity of the teams of people behind the technology, the trust they have built up over the years with fellow computer scientists, financial incumbents and, mosr importantly, with ordinary users.

Bitcoin is the internet of money.  It is the only base level protocol that is going to be needed (with the exception of a few fringe use cases).  

Any breakthroughs that are made through other initiatives can, if they have merit, be ported to secondary and tertiary layer protocols or even integrated into the base protocol should the BIP pass peer review.

That's a hard pill to swallow for many who see this as a technology war who have invested time and money in competing protocols and ICOs, but it's the truth.

Fortunately many of the bright minds behind those competing ideas will find their expertise will be very much needed on platforms like sidechain elements alpha, where the *real* web 3.0 renaissance can finally begin.

"i don't disagree that scale is a challenge on both.  my point is BTC broke adoption for LN that will *maybe* scale and BCH did not break this adoption.  i also disagree with the digital gold claim some BTC people make as 'digital gold store of value only/first' makes zero economic sense.  however that is kind of the point we are at today, and until LN really chooches and allows BTC to work as currency, i just see it as floundering around.  it doesn't seem to currently be in a state to even achieve the organic actual use it appears to have lost as a result of its high fees.

&gt; Any criticisms of LN are entirely pointless.

&gt; It is coming regardless of what misinformed people think of it. Its use is not mandatory. Anyone is free to do the same.

i don't understand these comments.  rick and others are not arguing ""it's not coming"" they are arguing about how realistic it is to expect it works anywhere near as well as the massive amount of faith that appears to have been placed into it.

&gt; It's nothing more than signal because that's what it is? They don't need 8mb, never mind 32mb. 

it's not just a signal - both of the changes in BTC and BCH have had clear results in their fees and in their adoption.  i don't care how many MB it is - it's a competing crypto currency.  i want to see actual market use and adoption.  that is the only thing that makes a currency actually have value, be stable, compete and last.  not zomg hodl to lambo fomo speculators.

&gt; It doesn't matter to them because their Alibaba nodes are likely run by wealthy early adopters, or nChain, or Bitcoin.com.

and isn't LN likely to be centralized into banks and other large holders?  should i really care about who gets mining reward anyway if my goal is a competing crypto currency?  this sounds akin to someone acting like they are poor because bill gates is rich.

&gt; It is emblematic of everything about BCH, designed purely as a signal with a disregard for long-term sustainability or network health. 

it allowed for continued market and merchant adoption rate while BTC caused the same to decline, do you deny either of these?

it seems at present to be doing better because less activity has been going on in the network.  but have they not for many months now have had negative adoption for actual currency use?  all the articles i used to read about this or that merchant accepting bitcoin have almost entirely changed to simply 'the price of bitcoin is this' and 'bitcoin is/not in a bubble' - any actual currency use appears to be dying.",1523857138

If it were demand for the blockspace itself that gave bitcoin its value it would make sense to cap the blocksize, as unlimited blockspace would mean unlimited supply.

But it's not a limited supply of blockspace that gives bitcoin its value, it's the limited supply of the tokens usable on those blocks, combined with the usefulness of those blocks. Limiting the size of the blocks limits the size of the market BTC tokens provide access to, thus reducing their usefulness.",1523856542

I believe in using blockchain not for the sake of it but when it can a) do something that can't be done with a relational database, and b) actually solves a real problem. For example a legitimate issue with social media is the unfairness of companies like Google and Facebook reaping billions of dollars of economic surplus every year that is created by their users. That could be addressed by new platforms incorporating micro payments to compensate content creators. Doing that without blockchain is extremely inefficient, especially internationally, but with blockchain it's feasible in a way we've never seen before.",1523855418

The concept is cool and i’m sure we will see some amazing stuff that we haven’t even thought of yet.   But let’s be honest,  supporting twitters usage alone requires over 5k transactions per second and a ridiculous storage capacity.   Increasing the block size is not enough to solve all the challenges inherent in something of this scale.    

Lastly, I was under the impression that digital cash is what BCH is all about.   The white paper, which is (overly) quoted as why BCH is the real bitcoin, focuses on a trustless digital cash system that solves the double spend issue without the need for a central authority.

I'm sure others could create post explain why Bitcoin as going down to $3k before it gets any where close to $20k again and everyone that *wants* to see Bitcoin back at those levels will surely take such a post as gospel just as mooners will look at a post like this and claim prophecy.

I didn’t know about that on wraith protocol, all I know it was released, but lack of PR since Justin sucks at it and has gotten better during this run, xvg crashed cause of a bug along with other coins bring better news, it was selling off. Yet during this bear market updates have been made and this “partner” and tokenpay sees value in verge and the wraith protocol over the other privacy coins.


I’m not saying verge is the best, but it’s good to point out facts like the tweet ledger posted saying xvg did contact them and they did give pricing but they updated their platform so you don’t need it.

"&gt; The point is that this is what we’re left with, which is no real choice at all politically. 

There were choices, and while most probably didn't like the choices, I think between the available candidates, the second best choice was made.

The best would've been Ron (didn't even run) or Rand Paul.

Both of the Democrat candidates were absolute garbage. A socialist that would've drove whatever remaining businesses out of the country or more of the Clinton Crime Cartel? No choice there. There was a third, but he didn't even poll.

The choices on the Republican side? It's pretty clear that the establishment on both sides wanted Jeb to be the nominee, to run against Clinton but he didn't even get any traction. America shouldn't have these dynasties with semi-royal historically shady families, that's just absurd.

What about the others? 

Ted Cruz, probably would've been a good number 3 pick, showing support for Audit the Fed legislation, and describing it as a Republican top priority in 2015. Along with wanting to abolish the IRS. But his religious views are a bit too strong to have won the general election.

Marco Rubio, his support for arming the Syrian rebels and his love for the NSA would've been disastrous, along with his opposition to decriminalization of illegal drugs, and the fact that he does not agree with cannabis legalization, are also particularly stupid.

John Kasich, another deep-state scumbag like Rubio. Trying to privatize prisons so judges are able to get kickbacks (which inevitably happens) for convicting innocent people, or automatically giving the longest sentence possible.

&gt;I will say that if you’re going to say Trump is proving to be anywhere close to a legitimate leader than you’re already gone IMO.

The elected leader is the legitimate leader, whether either of us likes it or neither of us likes it.

&gt; The establishment succeeds by giving you no internal electable option to promote true change. 

True change is only possible right now with a Constitutional Convention. Then necessary things like congressional term limits, a balanced budget amendment, and the abolition of corporate lobbying could finally be realized.

&gt; The only real tool we have is our money. Crypto can and should become an integral part of a global paradigm shift.

Globally, yes. 

The US had the keys to freedom in the 1800's, but then things like the IRS and the Fed were introduced in the early 1900's, leading to things like Social Security and Welfare, which should be decided by the individual states, not the Federal government. The bloated bureaucracy we have today is the result of over a century of incrementalism, and it should be clawed back piece by piece, which may take decades.

Forcing governments and politicians to transact on a publicly available ledger would go a long way towards fighting corruption, in addition to reducing the size and scope of the federal government.",1523852415

"The main benefit of bitcoin is that achieves the separation of money from controlling institutions or governments. So the value of it is determined by the successful uses of bitcoin exchanging goods or services.

Also it reduces the possibility of fraud or corruption. If it's used by a government, the public accounts for each senator, or politician can be audited for its transactions. You can know who's financing them, and where the money is going. No more private donations or money used for lobbying and buying politicians. The government can also collect taxes, and people can audit that collection and movement of money. (no more terrorist funding programs disguised as classified operations).

Also the trust provided by the verifications makes commerce safer. A business running a node can verify their transactions and avoid being a victim of fraud. (like credit card fraud or falsified money).",1523850856

"&gt;So, you think smart contracts like in Ethereum have no value at all

Smart contracts work on Bitcoin, too. It doesn't have native Turing expressivity like Ethereum does, but there are (many very valid) reasons why structuring the network such that the complex processing is done ""at the edges, by the parties who care"" rather than ""in the middle, redundantly, by everyone"" could be considered a superior approach. Furthermore, pretty much any halfway-interesting smart contract follows a pattern of: ""depending on external input data, transfer some form of value to a particular destination"" which can be done (arguably much more efficiently, securely, and understandably) with Bitcoin and an oracle (likely using multisignature) than with Ethereum and an oracle. As long as you have an oracle, Bitcoin+multisig works just as well as any fancy contract you could build with Ethereum (which, let's remember, *would still inevitably need an oracle* for that data input).

&gt;Vitalik wanted to add them to bitcoin, but got rejected

That's not true at all. Vitalik never contributed to Bitcoin Core/QT (and never even tried).

He claims he considered trying to implement Ethereum via OP_RETURN, but decided not to when he saw Luke-Jr passionately arguing that non-monetary use cases of Bitcoin's blockchain should be discouraged. Not only is this very likely post hoc rationalization, but even if we take a leap of faith and take Vitalik at his word, he never ""got rejected"" at all, and in fact never tried to contribute anything to Bitcoin protocol development; what you are saying now is a total myth.

&gt;Should he not have done anything in your opinion, since he wasn't allowed to add his features to bitcoin (which would have required a hard fork anyway?)

Again, you're repeating a myth. He never *tried* to add any features to Bitcoin. You can't say he ""wasn't allowed"" because he never even made an attempt.

Also, he claims he was going to try a Counterparty-esque approach, which does not require a hard fork (Counterparty works fine). The much-more-likely reason he didn't take this route is because there was virtually no demand for Counterparty (and essentially there still isn't), and he probably figured an ICO represented a bigger opportunity to make a splash. Which wasn't wrong, but certainly isn't a noble motive worth admiration or anything.",1523849908

Only if the domain name is transferred between Registrars would a record of change be noted and the Creation date remain the same.

&gt; OK, so not only is it evidence-free, it's also 'only about 50% correct'. This is very helpful for the inevitable inconsistencies. It makes it just about completely unfalsifiable.

You'll only find what you're actually searching for.

If you're actively looking for anything which appears to be wrong then that's precisely what you shall find.

If you call evidence actual files dated from 2008-2011 then you would be absolutely correct and there is 0% evidence.

"&gt;""bitcoin couldn't hit a million because Satoshi would be worth over a trillion""

That's like saying ""Tim Berners-Lee couldn't have invented the internet because it he had patented it he world have been 'worth' more than Bill Gates"".  Of course, like Satoshi, Tim didn't patent the internet (even though he knew it would have made him the richest human on earth over night) because he knew it would have lead to a diaspora of corporate internets where no one person had universal access to the truth.

So... since we're fine with psychopaths and dictators we've never met becoming billionaires and wielding unchecked power over governments, we ought be fine with a Satoshi being a trillionaire since he/she/they have a long, auditable history of being someone who cares very deeply about the world and the problems that come with power (hence Satoshi insisted on group concensus).

Further, since bitcoin is just code, there is nothing (at least technically) to suggest the Satoshi coins couldn't be moved to a decentralised global aid fund overseen and governed by the group.

Similar to how dormant bank accounts in the UK have recently had their funds diverted to homeless charities.

Whether there are ethical considerations for setting such a precedent is another matter.

Finally, there exists the very real possibility that Satoshi (and bitcoin) is a product of governments (just as TOR is) and the keys are already in the hands of organisations like the EFF/UN.

There's a good chance that most of the money which has entered the market at some point is money which tends to stick around in some capacity. I imagine many of the people who bought in during December, got burned and made the decision to cash out, are at least curious enough to be watching from the sidelines and are checking back from time-to-time to see what happens to the market. Many will be waiting to buy back in once the market shows strength, or even if they don't intend to right now, they'll be nervously checking the prices every couple of days to make sure they made the right decision. Knowing its history, this is not the kind of market you sleep on. 

I know quite a few people on here have talked about how in December even their grandma was calling them up to ask about Bitcoin, but personally I didn't see it myself. I don't think we quite reached that level of widespread mania yet. Since it made news headlines a lot of people were at least *aware* that Bitcoin exists, but although they may have been curious about it, I don't think it went much further than that for the masses. It may have come up in conversation, but very few people I know expressed actual interest in buying in - actually, I only know one person who did. Also, the masses for the most part are aware of Bitcoin and Bitcoin alone.

You can buy and sell Bitcoin very quickly 24/7/365 once you are setup on an exchange. Many people just buy and hold.

"Yeah, trust me, I understand. What you don't understand is simply hiding shit from the IRS, if it's true all trades are taxable events, doesn't mean you can just cash out crypto and pretend like your two fiat gateway trades are all your records.

But hey, you won't be the first or the last to think they are more clever than government tax authorities ",1523846048
"I feel like the Verge team is going to make an announcement saying they partnered with 1 of 5 or 6 different huge companies, Amazon, Walmart, PornHub, Ebay, PayPal, Target etc. so that it isn't easy to verify it as false, sell all their coins into the incoming droves of buyers and then exit scam once its proven to be untrue with actual BTC, ETH, or other nonverge coins that will have value.

The crypto community is pretty silent right now. This roller coaster better has to slow down and stop making everyone dizzy. ,1523845998
"Banks have a flaw which works against something with a cap, like Bitcoin. And that flaw is in the way interest works. Banks have products, in some ways no different than going to a retailer and buying something off the shelf. What the sell is money, and they only ask that you pay them later instead of right up front.

There is an expectation that you will be able to cover your debt because you are going to be paid by someone who has also barrowed. As a result banks will accumulate wealth and make the resource more rare, increasing its value, and making it less liquid. This was the problem with the gold standard and why governments issue fiat currency.

Lending institutions need to stick with fiat because there needs to be a way to always introduce more currency into the system to suppress that inflation. The federal reserve and international banks set those rates to stimulate circulation.

I think the advantage that cryptocurrencies represent is that we have a way to completely change how things are done. This means that whenever financial institutions try to adopt cryptocurrencies I have to be leary and suspicious of their motives, because their business models don't work with this emerging market and instead we need to implement new tools.",1523845971

"USD Fiat to crypto forces an exchange to be held at a higher standard to back the usd deposits. Once its converted to crypto, there is no recourse. So, this strengthens legitimacy, creates easier access to the whole cryptoverse, not just the few coins something like Coinbase offers, and also benefits the Coss shareholders immensely. 

I’m still picking up more, it’s all relative, if I’m buying Coss at $.30 with ETH and ETH rose 15-20% since 2 weeks ago when I started heavily accumulating Coss at $.16, then I’m still comfortable in the $.30ish range. If ETH was still down but Coss price went up, I would reassess my buys.

"No, dude, you don't get it.

Calculating it, while a headache, isn't complicated. bitcoin.tax makes it easy.

What is fucked up and is stopping people FROM doing their taxes is the IRS wants money from us on coin-to-coin trades where we never see the fucking money on it. 

If i bought $10,000 of bitcoin in January and by December its worth $100,000 and i then trade BTC for ETH, IRS wants to tax me roughly 40% on that $90,000 gain when I've not even seen the fucking money. Its still sitting in ETH. So you either need to sell 40% of your ETH to pay taxes, or you need to have money already set aside to pay the taxes.

Its a broken fucking system. I'm not advocating skipping out on taxes. were all fine paying taxes for what is rightfully owed. However, this is fucking bullshit and I'll not buy into the IRS extorting us to sell our shares.

6 months from now we'll have Substratum running a decentralized internet, sending traffic to decentralized exchanges, where we can do cross-chain atomic swaps with Komodo.

"I don't know enough about EOS to judge, but on the rest:
ETH has so many interesting applications in smart contract software I betting it will remain good long term play. It feels like ETH has much more real value and less of a speculative element because ETH is essentially purchasable network space on a widely adopted blockchain and even if it's not adopted as a currency, it's still a sort of AWS product. ETH is the safest bet in crypto to me, but that's not saying much.
NEO has an interesting design, and is popular with Asian markets, which I think is currently the most important crypto market, so I would rate it second.
As a software developer, WAVES use of Scala kinda concerns me. Folks I've worked with from big silicon valley firms have told me Scala projects tend to slow drastically as they grow, but I've never worked with Scala in a team, so take this all with a grain of salt. I'm inclined to believe them because Scala offers way too many ways to do the same thing, and after a while, things would get confusing if you didn't adhere to a rigorous style guide. I could totally be wrong because this is an opinion, and if you think so, buy WAVES, but I've heard of way too many high profile, large scale Scala applications that appear to be okay then have impossibly complex flaws that appear later.

"He's right to point out this danger: the BCH community is not a random selection of former BTCers. It is a selection of people who thought it's okay/a good idea to go your own way when you reach an impassible disagreement.

I am a pro-secession ancap myself who supports the Nozick-type idea of everyone seceding till they find a level of organization they can happily accept voluntarily, and maybe this is part of why I support BCH.

But we have to be aware of the pitfalls of this mentality, too: there is strength in numbers, especially with something like crypto, which relies on network effects.

Recently I was having a discussion with someone who claimed nChain is ""Blockstream 2.0."" Basically that the exact same thing is happening again. But I don't expect history to repeat itself, at least not exactly. The BCH community is a very different community from the BTC community and may face different dangers.

This is not to say we should drop our guard against groupthink, going along to get along, blind adherence to authority and unwillingness to defy perceived ""consensus."" But we should also be aware of the opposite danger: naturally contrarian types (of which I am one) seeing a new cult leader behind every corner and going their own way until BCH is balkanized down to nothing.

Mike Hearn is right that crypto is a social problem. And solving social problems is quite hard. Sometimes the best way is just to go your own way (as I wish e.g. California and Texas and many other parts of the US would just break up rather than remaining locked in eternal struggle over conflicting visions), but that doesn't mean that's always the best way, either.

"&gt; Blindly supporting anything is bad. Banks have a purpose in creating credit. However they have a monopoly which Bitcoin is countering.

we really don't need to fight because we both agree on this.

&gt; It is good you did your research, but assuming all anti bank people haven't is also wrong.

I didn't assume this about anti-banks people, I just said if you looked harder into the entire history you would get a more complete picture of why we are where we are.

And just to be clear, I myself AM anti-bank. I know it immediately may sounds like I'm some pro-bank bitcoin newbie who just got into Bitcoin a couple of months ago just to make quick bucks, but I am not. It's really hard to come to a bitcoin forum and talk about how banks do provide benefit without sounding like a clueless pro-bank guy, but I hope I am making myself clear: Banks DO have benefits and that's why people use them. All I'm trying to point out is how dangerous it is to just mindlessly think that EVERYTHING about banks is bad and banks are some organizations we need to kill off. Banks are not enemies. They are just a bad system. And like we agree, Bitcoin will solve this because the fundamentally centralized structure won't fix itself.

&gt; Your post is ironic because I bet you haven't even looked at your banks balance sheet because at least I have.

You make accusations about me making assumptions but you're also making assumptions. I have looked at my bank balance sheet. In fact I try my best to remove my dependence on banking and credit system. For example I don't own a credit card and my credit score is shit. But this is what I believe in.

&gt; I for one actually looked at my banks balance sheet ( public records ). What more research does one need...

It's not just about looking at the current situation. My point was that everything exists for a reason. And before you tell me I'm rationalizing why banks are a good thing, again, that's not what I'm saying. If people use Facebook even though they all feel unhappy, there DOES exist a reason why they do so. If people use banks even though they don't like them, there DOES exist a reason for that. And if you just ignore all that and just say ""You're an idiot if you use Facebook"" or ""You're an idiot if you use banks"", you will never see the fundamental problem. And what I'm suggesting is that a thorough study of the entire history is very helpful in understanding these.",1523841863

You're right in saying it's easier to influence the Litecoin market than the Bitcoin market, but that's because Bitcoin has a bigger market cap. This has nothing to do with price though. Price is just market cap divided by some arbitrary constant.

Whatever the model will be, any centralized institution will be flattening out into networks of services. We are already seeing it with UBER, Google, amazon, facebook and air bnb. Those companies are a blend between centralization and networks.

The model of the future is going to be decentralized networks. Why do we need UBER to handle the transactions between user and car in a bitcoin world?

The day bitcoin really is useful for something, getting it at the quantities we do today would be insane. Think of bitcoins as land: was land valuable in America at the beginning? No, because it had no infrastructure, no community no nothing. Land was virtually free and thus people hoarded acres and acres of it. You could not create more land, the same way you can marginally create more bitcoin.

So is the 'bitcoin land' a good land to buy? Well, it has a huge evolving community, awareness, and real iinfrastructure and funding and investment. So I think that bitcoin has the capacity to come coveted land: but in the same measure, lots of land in the us is still pretty much worthless.

The members companies own small portions of the shares in each other's companies, centered on a core bank; this system helps insulate each company from stock market fluctuations and takeover attempts, thus enabling long-term planning in projects.

If you say 1 Sat/B is too high? What is the current fee that will be routed  fine over the network? What does the fee lower to after the May hard fork to multiply the block space by 4?

It's not a problem they can solve. Also on Bitcoin Cash low fee issues would surely be not even 0.001% of the transactions they process. They've made usability on Bitcoin Cash 10x worse and 10x more complicated than they need to be.

Every so often (e.g. weekly) send all the bitcoin to an exchange &amp; sell the BTC for your local fiat currency, then transfer those proceeds back to your bank. KEEP CAREFUL RECORDS OF ALL YOUR CONVERSIONS TO YOU LOCAL CURRENCY. Not all exchanges provide the necessary tax documents.

If you want an added layer of security/privacy, you should change the BTC address you post by the cash register every time someone uses it. If you do this you don’t need to transfer to new addresses every so often like I mentioned above.

"Nobody here said that people can't gamble if they like. The problem is the way you presented this game, talk about winning 2.5-3.5x the amount you bet. This means you could lose 3 times and still be winning. In most scenarios that just wont be happening.

Let's pretend BTC, ETH and LTC have the same odds and amount of bets, which will not be the case since who would bet on LTC when you got BTC?


50 people on each, so pool is 150 ETH and chance to win is 33%. House takes 7.5 USD, so winning pool is 142.5.

You win 2.85 - 1 ETH bet = 1.85.

But you also have 2/3 chance to lose.

So if you play 3 games you will lose 2 ETH. Winnings - losings = 1.85 - 2 = -0.15. Can't say the house always wins, have to say that ETHORSE always wins.

I have no idea how you calculated that people win about 2.5-3.5x but that is just bullshit.



Also you deliberately decided to talk about betting in ETH and winning in USD. Losing and betting 1 ETH is not sounding that bad, when you could win 1k-2k USD every day, and that is a lot of money!

There will never be a single crypto-currency, there will be a dominant crypto-currency and a certain number of specialized coins that will be used for (as the name suggest) less generic usage.

"I will continue laughing at this subreddit because the first rule in stacking money is to always trade hype and go for gains. 
But then again you some of you stupid fucks have been in this game only one year and you probably ""HODL"" (insert stupid spelling) coins because you've somehow convinced yourselves that you are genius investors because you believe in some shit project that has a wallet out..  Lol.
Does this wallet hold money that I can spend on my hobbies, my house or Agent Provocateur for my chicks huge tits?
That's the question.
We do this for gains.
The only thing not ""reckt"" this week is the profits that I cashed out in BTC on coinbase and the stake I upped myself to swing trade more ETH.

Thanks for the hype Verge.

"Just wanted to jump into respond to your remarks. 

First of all, I think it's important to note that many of the behaviors that are tolerated/encouraged and celebrated in crypto are nothing but a form of mass gambling aided/blunted by a reliance on the overall community to engage in/limit the negative consequences of behaviors like: 

1. Buying millions of dollars in tokens from startups that promise investors nothing but a potential increase in token value IF, that token is accepted onto centralized exchanges that are both non-secure and privacy violating 

2. Pushing put the value of other tokens by encouraging others to purchase them in the hopes that mysterious 'partnerships' and other activities will take place, once again pushing up the token value so that others can sell them. 

3. Encouraging others to 'invest' in trustless Pozi schemes like POWH in order to cash out on the last one to participate in the scheme. 

Millions of dollars are sloshing around crypto chasing phantom or dubious projects in the hopes of 'lambo' or moon' 

**Let's not pretend that *anyone* in the crypto space is not gambling** and that because it's accepted by the masses it's anything different. 

People that protest that a Dapp that is clearly and transparently positioning itself as a betting game is some how worse than the gambling activity that goes on in crypto daily are highly hypocritical in my mind. 

Let me get to your points: 

1. I'm not affiliated with the development team and am an investor (and soon to be player in the game). I compared Ethorse to binary options trading to communicate the fact that it requires **more skill** than other forms of betting that are entirely non-skill-based, including rolling the dice and hoping that random numbers land in your favor (there's a popular Dapp that's pulling in millions a day dedicated to that purpose BTW). 

2. My statement re: potential winnings. Didn't you see me mention that this applies to *winnings* and that I accounted for losses in my statement? I'm not saying that people playing the Dapp won't lose. Instead, I'm saying **if you win** you can expect winnings that 2x or 3x your bet. (I've played the game testnet at least 40 times over the last few weeks, this is my experience actually playing the game.)

3. Didn't I add a clearly displayed disclaimer that said **don't bet what you can't afford to lose**? How much clearer can I be that there's risk associated with this activity. 

4. Regarding small cap cryptos, the developers have purposely not included small cap cryptos in the game because of this very reason. It's betting on BTC, LTC and ETH. 

The only ones, manipulating the price of these assets are big institutional investors shaking out the retail investors by triggering stop losses that either cause them to have losses or lower gains than they would have ordinarily. If manipulation's going on, it's not happening because of a Dapp that pulls in pennies compared to the tens of millions being made by big investors daily. Yes, it's true, the only ones who made money during the bear market were either those who understand how the market works and how to make quick trades, big investors, or those who just hold. 

You can accuse me of painting an optimistic picture of the game, but not of lying. After all, when people are told they can win $125 million in the U.S. lottery and line up for hours to purchase a ticket, they're told they're just 'following the dream.' I'm telling you that with a bit of luck and skill you can put some of the ETH you've made to work. What's wrong with that? 

Playing Ethorse is *much* better than throwing it at the random ICO and hoping something (often barely useful) comes out on the other side in my book. Better to throw 5 ETH at Ethorse and see what happens than 'investing' in most ICOs and the majority of tokens on exchanges. 

Thanks for your comments. ",1523835024

This is not good. The 1 sat/byte fee is too high for the current supply of block space. Wallets need to be able to lower their default fee, or at least allow users to set a lower fee, without causing users to get stuck in payment gateways. BIP70 prevents such failures.

&gt; If the user used a bung wallet doing 0 Sat/B or whatever then that's their problem.

No. The user is going to complain to customer support anyway, making it BitPay's problem costing BitPay money.

Users still using a non-BIP70 wallet is their problem...

&gt; BitPay can just monitor for double spends by monitoring a handful of nodes for double spends then BitPay can reject double spent payments.

"Even though I disagree on several points, I think this is overall a well thought-out and articulate position.  Thanks for posting it.

&gt; The ""fee market"" is nonsense because fees are not the commodity. They are what you pay for the commodity. The correct term has to be ""blockspace market"". A place where blockspace is supplied and bought for a price.

&gt; Blockspace is the commodity because it has supply (which has a production cost such as hardware, electricity, orphan risk) and demand (for consumption for the blockchain based economy).

This x100; I strongly agree.  ""Fee market"" is definitely a misnomer, AFAICT.

&gt; BSCores blockspace market is broken because it is subject to a fixed production quota (the blocksize limit) which makes it so that no amount of demand can increase the amount of supply. This situation is known as a market failure.

I'm not quite sure why a fixed supply of something is automatically equivalent to a market failure.  For example, there's a limited amount of land in downtown Toronto, and no matter how high the prices get, there's not going to become more land downtown.

Other things can happen, of course: the increased value will lead people to be willing to pay more for smaller space, and make things like skyscrapers economically viable, since you can fit more value into that land space.  I see this comparable to the work being done on Bitcoin to fit more economic activity into the same amount of blockspace through things like LN, MAST, schnorr, etc.

&gt; This leads to economic friction where the price for the commodity (blockspace) is far too high in periods of high demand, and far too low in periods of slumped demand. Ultimately it limits demand. But since demand for blockspace is generated by the consumption of blockspace (for the blockchain based economy), it limits the size of that economy. I.e. the blockchain based economy cannot grow. That's a failure of adoption.

I think this is somewhat correct, though I'd correct ""failure of adoption"" to ""constraint on adoption"".  (Failure would mean that adoption stops or disappears outright, IMO.)

Adoption has certainly been hampered by the blockspace limitation.  But it's worth noting that there's a reason for that.  I'm sure you will disagree, but the reason many of us are supportive of the current blockspace limitation is because we are confident that increasing it will result in a loss of decentralization that outweights the benefit.

I don't expect you to agree with this point, but I think it's at least worth mentioning, because other than leaving that point out, you've done a great job of characterizing the situation, IMO.

&gt; Fortunately it is only BSCores internal blockspace market that is broken. There exist many providers of blockspace outside of BSCore. If the demand for blockspace cannot be satisified within one (perhaps once preferential) blockchain, that demand simply moves to another blockchain. Valuations and transaction volumes on other blockchains are a reflection of that shift, and for instance Ethereums transaction count is already ~400% of what BSCores is, rising rapidly it is set to go for 1000% and beyond this year.

I think this is also true!  There definitely is available blockspace elsewhere, and there has been and will continue be some movement toward them.

"brokers exist in the stock markets for 2 reasons: to hold your stock (at the DTCC) and trade on your behalf at the stock exchange (NYSE only knows their members /  brokers and they have no idea who sent the order to the broker)

in crypto, neither of these two roles are necessary and therefore there are no brokerages in that sense of the word.

the crypto exchange is taking your orders directly and also ""holding"" your coins until you decide to transfer them back to the blockchain.

whereas in stocks, they are never in ""your"" possession and are always recorded in the broker's name.

"&gt; OK, so if you already knew at the time you posted that chart, that Dell and Valve had stopped accepting Bitcoin in 2017 and that Edeka was only one independent franchise

Moreover, I've included this info directly into the chart. 

&gt;  it seems very disingenuous to still include these companies in your 2018 listing. They are not ""Expected changes in 2018"", they had already changed.

The list for 2017 includes them. The list for 2018 will not. Thus, it's indeed expected changes in 2018. I don't understand how it's disingenuous if I'm openly writing about it in the chart. 

&gt; Edeka should never have been on your list in the first place. 

I think major franchises should be included too, as the growth of acceptance among them is a useful indicator too. I've made a separate category for them to avoid any confusion.

as one of their ""almost any way to pay"" anymore, and can't find any other mention of Bitcoin

"If you're truly interested in this topic, you should graduate from listening only to people like Andreas and really study economics as a whole, from classical to keynesian to austrian. They all have their own valid points, and none of them have been proven wrong. That's the whole point of science. People come up with different theories. Some of them work for certain cases and some other theories work better for interpreting certain other phenomena in the world. That's why we have Newtonian physics but also Einstein's relativity theory, and also quantum physics.

The point I'm trying to make is that most people in the community seem to make decisions based on what they heard from other ""crypto celebrities"" and automatically make decisions on what is good and what is bad. This is antithesis to the whole mantra of ""do your own research and make your own informed decision"".

Studying the entire ""economics"" may sound overwhelming but it's not that hard nowadays if you really put your mind to it, just go read a comprehensive book about history of the world, history of money, economic theories, or even watch some youtube video series on these topics. That will open your mind.

"Look, I follow what you're saying, but your definition of ""realised gains"" is not quite in line with what it has long been understood to be.

With stocks, there is nothing that requires you to trade to fiat first. If you can find somebody (and you probably can if you try hard enough) that's willing to give you AAPL stock directly for GOOG stock, you can make that trade. And when you do, based on laws we've had for decades, at the time of the trade, you've realised your gains on your GOOG stock, and you need to record its fiat market value at the time, and pay tax based on that.

With stocks, you use fiat as a bridge because it makes life easier for everyone. Also, you can't own fractions of a stock, which would make stock-to-stock trading very inconvenient. But if a market is set up where people can list offers for stock-to-stock trades, the tax would work the same as in a crypto-to-crypto market.

For both stocks and crypto, the manner in which most trades happen is just a matter of what's easier logistically. With stocks, going through fiat makes it easier logistically, because you can't own fractions of a stock. With crypto, going direct or via another crypto (like BTC) makes it easier logistically, because it's hard for exchanges to offer a fiat option, so they don't. Despite the technicalities of how those trades happen, they are equivalent on a fundamental level, and there's no reason I can see to tax them differently, except maybe to make record-keeping easier.

&gt; exchanges trading alt coins don't allow you to purchase it with fiat so you have to use btc and realize your gains before you even have the opportunity to set aside any of it for tax purposes

Nothing's stopping you from setting aside some of the BTC you received each time you sold an alt, and cash it out to fiat via the fiat ramp of your choice on a regular basis, so as not to let BTC price fluctuations have too much of an effect. It's not easy, and perhaps exchanges should make it easier, because if they put in the effort, it can be as easy for you as checking a checkbox in your settings.",1523828792
"I can see the volatility or liquidity being an issue if the amount transferred is very big. But then at the same time, the privacy only works if there are loads of transactions using it, but the default transactions are not private, right? So 90% of all the transactions are not with privacy, so the ones that are private are quite easy to single out then, especially in big amounts. So sending BTC from BTC addresses to another, even with WAN, will still be visible to someone who is expecting that to happen between them and is looking at those two BTC addresses.

I have to admit that I still fail to see what is the incentive to use WAN compared to buying XMR for privacy or buying ETH for smart contracts? You still have to pay for gas as a transaction fee, just like you pay BNB or something on an exchange for 0.05%. Is the fee going to be much smaller than that?",1523828778
"Before BTC went off-mission, it was well on it's way to making this sort of adoption happen. The nearly free fees, freedom for The People mission and other advantages of BCH should be enough to garner mass adoption.

"“...the immediate past rapid technological changes, taking place in a mass-producing economy and among a population predominantly propertyless, have always tended to produce economic and social confusion. To deal with confusion, power has been centralized and government control increased. It is probable that all the world’s governments will be more or less completely totalitarian even before the harnessing of atomic energy; that they will be totalitarian during and after the harnessing seems almost certain. Only a large-scale popular movement towards decentralization and selfhelp can arrest the present tendency towards statism. At present there is no sign that such a movement will take place.”

"&gt; wouldnt the value of it stabilize to the point where btc denominated wages are a reality?

No, it would not, as in the long term, Bitcoin can only ever deflate.

And as this deflation is fueled by lost coins, a factor that scales based on usage, it's going to get quite bad.

&gt; why are they absolutely necessary?

To get to the root of the issue, there's two sides here:

1) Saved money is money sitting around, doing nothing, for the sake of the economy, it might as well not exist. This is bad, as the total size of the economy is capped by the amount of money _in circulation_.

2) Saving takes time, and time is not available for a _lot_ of use cases. How are kids supposed to eventually acquire a house? Slave away as child labourers for a pittance? How are businesses going to react to new market opportunities if it takes them a decade to save up the capital themselves? (And no, investment rounds don't count. Investors expect their money back as well, and investment is also disincentivized by deflation)",1523828330

"Wow, what a contentless shitpost. The whole situation is entertaining, but this sub has to be the most entertaining part, and not for the reasons it thinks. If XVG is the weirdo doing an interpretive dance in the townsquare, this sub is the guy standing 25 feet behind him trying to see how much of his own feces he can fit in his ears while screaming about his love of PB&amp;J&amp;C sandwiches (I'll leave you to figure out the 'C').

(Disclaimer: Mined a bit of XVG, but not enough to care if I lose it, so I'm enjoying the drama as much as other folks.)

""Ledger doesn't know about any integration. The sub mod lied!""
 
* Or the mod of a subreddit took a guess and was wrong. For the announcement to be a big deal, I would think it has to be more than getting hardware wallet support, so that clearly isn't ""The Partnership"". I'm totally ready for a let down and got a kick out of the EMC2 announcement pump and dump a few months ago, but this seems like literally nothing. It's a rumor of an assumption of an interpretation of an off-the-cuff remark.

""They moved the coins! Scam!""

 * Seems that it would be a good idea for a partnering company to get some portion of their 'untraceable, anonymous' money before the announcement. Do people think that business partnerships happen entirely AFTER the announcement? No, you lay groundwork, draw up paperwork, talk to legal, etc. first. Astonishingly, some things in life require a down payment. This is the objection that makes me think this sub is populated by 14 year olds.

""Obvious exit scam is obvious.""

* Guys, here's the plan: We start a coin with no pre-mine or ICO. Then we wait for 4 years until the market and our coin value skyrockets, but then wait for it to crash. Now, we make sure that cryptocurrency has become a major financial player that's drastically undervalued, but then, rather than wait for the next big Bitcoin spike that reliably happens at the end of the year, we'll sell everything off on a random day to scam a few million out of the project and community we cultivated. Who's up for making only 5% of our potential profit? Woo! Ransack the town BEFORE burning all the bridges; don't salt the earth if your troops are starving.

""It isn't anonymous!""

* Tor built in is gimmicky - any other wallet could add that as a feature for any other coin. But, it means more Tor traffic which is good for Tor, and it's entirely seamless for the less technical. So, transfer from wallet to exchange, trade for XMR, trade back to XVG, and send back to wallet. That seems pretty anonymous to me. A government level actor could (probably) easily track it with ISP data from you and the exchange, but average Joes wouldn't with a block explorer. Again, anyone could do this with any wallet and any coin, provided they have the technical knowledge to set up Tor (which is really not hard at all). No idea how wraith works, but supposedly it makes it even harder to track.

All in all, this sub (CC) sounds like a bunch of frothing at the mouth, flunky teenagers trying to gain each other's approval by not doing their homework because ""school is stupid"". Where is the real evidence? ""McAfee and the 51% attack, and and and..."" Every time I've pressed, I've gotten zero hard evidence - only memes, mythology (""It was known"", ""Everyone has said"", etc""), and a disturbing lack of knowledge about basic business practices.

On the plus side, it's allowed me to better calibrate the usefulness of Reddit for crypto research. Coin subs are mostly cheerleaders and general subs are echo chambers filled with children.

"Deflationary economy isn't perfect. You can still have a slowdown and people will take a hit to their wage when the currency goes up in value. Loans are simple since you can always have a static value set to pay (shrinking payments) which benefits the loaner for not being affected by inflation and still receiving interest. As the value of bitcoin goes up, everything must go down in value and will cause these crashes as well. However the big difference is the money is safe. Since we hoard the money,  not assets, we will be alright with money still left in our pockets. People will still own the devalued assets but hey you still have money to keep the business going and have to lay off thousands of employees. It won't prevent layoffs however from the losses of assets getting devalued but still is a much better outcome than the entire business going under. ",1523827144

"I wrote down some Verge history in an earlier thread the other day. I'll just repost it here since you seem curiou. Here is a copy of my post:

To understand how Verge works, just look at ""Wraith protocol"" that does not exist, it was just a hypeword for optional stealth adresses from 2014. Something that any coin can use. It's a wallet level feature, not protocol level. They are also worthless for privacy, especially if they are optional.

""So the only difference with stealth addresses is essentially to move the chore of producing a unique address from the server to the client. Indeed, in some ways stealth addresses may be worse, since very few people use them, and if you are known to be one of them, it will be easier to connect stealth transactions with you.

It doesn't provide ""100% anonymity"". The fundamental anonymity weakness of Bitcoin remains - that everyone can follow the chain of payments, and if you know something about one transaction or the parties to it, you can deduce something about where those coins came from or where they went.""

https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/20701/what-is-a-stealth-address

""I was in Verge team when Wraith protocol was ""invented"" by M.Stolaire at those times. The name was intentionally picked to be catchy and proclaimed to be some sort of new tech. Then it was hyped properly. Noobs don't bother what tech it does, McAfee tweets, noobs see price under $, see price of Bitcoin over 15k$ and buy and fomo others. Same now. Xvg net attacked, main dev writes in telegram and other channels its normal and that's it. Fanatic comunity just say nothing happened. Now the hype with partnership is steaming and nobody cares about attack. “ Speculation :that partnership gonna be very probably with German Bank and they will release xvg debit cards. Imagine Verge chain being attacked in future, how you will pay with such card. Useless. And I'm not even talking about that when I was in team dev said xvg will NEVER partnership with bank, ever. Because it is anonymous, decentralized currency.“ W/e. he lies so often, that it does not matter what he says. One of the reason I left team after June, July, August roadmap kept postponing and stayed undelivered without explanation to us as a team or to comunity. ""

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3256693.840

Who is the dev you might wonder?

A guy convicted for numerous crimes and he also does not know how to code. Some examples of what he did include drug charges, multiple traffic violations, trespassing, giving wrong name to an officer, contempt of court, failure to appear in court, violating probation, damaging property.

"&gt; What's the law (or your understanding of it) on that? 

I'm not a legal expert, but I know that you must report any income, just as you would from a job.

&gt; Like if I'm using awesome miner and autocomverting to btc do I have to report each of those conversions to btc as a trade?

I've not used awesome miner so I can only speak from my own experience.   I have mined with NiceHash, STORJ, and Vertcoin.  For NiceHash, while I technically mined many different coins, I only ever received income in BTC.   The latter paid out in their respective coins.  Therefore, I reported income in BTC, STORJ, and VTC.

In my case, I had BTC going straight into a Coinbase account.  If I later decided to move that BTC to Bittrex or cash out to PayPal, then yes, I would have to realize any gain or loss from the time of original receipt.  This sounds a lot like you moving money from your pool account to a wallet.

&gt;Do I just go by market value when I transfer it out of my pool account to my own wallet or do I need to keep up with the price each time the pool credits me?  I don't understand how I could be expected to keep up with all that happens before it's transferred out to my wallet.

If you use software like Bitcoin Tax, they already have the historical pricing data so long as you record the accurate date and time of transactions.  So no, you don't need to keep up with all of that.
",1523826577
"&gt; Unsubstantiated claim

data on chain goes up -&gt; resource usage goes up across all full nodes (cpu/io/ram/network) -&gt; nodes that can't catch up either need to spend extra money on upgrades or go offline -&gt; by going offline they effectively increase ""average node processing power"" across the network, which in turns makes it look like network can take in even more data. end result - only filthy rich will ever be able to afford running a node.

this is all simple fact. the disagreement is purely philosophical - i think commodity hardware should always be able to run a node. whole slew of people on this sub don't. that's why there is bcash.

&gt; Nothing raises the cost of participation as much as transactional friction

you're conflating participation in being part of the network and participation in using the network. the two are very different.

&gt; That doesn't even mean anything.

spam and using blockchain as your personal ""free"" distributed database are trivial examples.

&gt; If you implement a production quota, you don't let the free market discover the right balance between supply and demand and hence the price for the commodity goes completely out of whack.

your assumption (and not only your) is that 1mb limit is nothing else than ""production quota for the sake of production quota"". the other perspective is that bitcoin is a conservative network that values stability over hyping things up and throwing around big numbers - that has value in itself (and market so far agrees).

&gt; Evidently blockspace isn't 1mb... Hence the commodity isn't scarce by nature.

i've already mentioned negative effects of increasing blockspace. true, it's not scarce by nature, it's scarce because we understand that it *must be* for network to remain robust and cheap to participate. that doesn't mean blockspace won't be increased in future, but only if other scalability options are exhausted and/or there is significant certainty that network won't be adversely affected by a particular increase.

&gt; blockspace demand has largely moved everywhere else

sure, cryptokitties moved somewhere else, the blockspace demand that matters has mostly stayed with bitcoin.

&gt; Which is meaningless if nobody can afford to use it

so far absolute majority of cryptocurrency transfer volumes are on bitcoin. hashrate is not meaningless, it is literally the measure of security of the chain.

"Consumption doesnt just decrease indefinitely.

You are parroting a poor understanding of why economists talk about the dangers of deflation and under what conditions deflationary spirals can occur.

Empirically with bitcoin price swings, we actually see wealth effects overpower the propensity to hoard, when the price rises: we see *more* spending.  And if you think bitcoin is a poor currency (or rather, not one at all), you are correct (for now).

Money is neutral in the long run. Frictional problems with deflation have more to do with expectations and institutions built in to the existing system.  Loans are displaced by savings under deflation and wage contracts can be pegged to an deflation index. Free banking and competotive issue of currency accomodate demand to hold.",1523826469

In the U.S., there are many other better angles to sell Bitcoin to regular Joe than trying to convince them banks are evil. It's the last country in the world where that tactic would work, since most fiat money in the world are pegged to USD.

In fact, I even think that one day banks may even blend themselves into the Bitcoin economy and function as a transparent guard of the technology. Everything bad about money starts from the fact that it's not transparent and the government can print money on their own. If everything becomes transparent, governments and banks won't be able to do that easily because everything is visible on the blockchain.",1523826289

"Of course. I'm aware of all that. 

But if you walk into your bank TODAY, and ask for $10 from your account, and they don't give you your money. You can sue them. That's theft.

There's a difference between worst case scenario and everyday scenario. If you try to convince regular joe that ""banks are thieves"", that won't work because there's no alternative. For them it's working just fine. Actually even for myself who knows EVERYTHING about how money works all the way from the top level to the bottom fractional reserve banking system, I still use banks. ""You should use Bitcoin to hedge against banks going bankrupt"" is a terrible way to convince regular users unless they live in corrupt countries (Those who live in corrupt countries don't need convincing anyway) A better way to convince regular people is to focus on what actually sounds reasonable even if they don't understand the entire hierarchy of money system.",1523825399

"I agree, I'd be way happier with a slow steady increase than going parabolic again.

Parabolic is nice, but then you have to time the top, which can be +/- 50% gains in one our then back down. So you ALWAYS feel bad selling early or late. Then it corrects so hard that it takes weeks, months or (historically in a slower market) years to recover.

I'd rather the same growth, but just steady stable adoption, with nice solid slow baseline growth.

Some people love the ""gambling"" aspect and dopamine hits though, so I can definitely understand people that want to ride the parabolic wave then try to time the top and short the recession. I just think if you miss on that you can lose everything. 

Crypto is such a no brainer (long term), that we are all millionaires if this thing just grows in a stable way. I don't need to be a billionaire if it means I can be broke also. I'd rather just take the more known money that's still plenty to retire off of.

"&gt; Bullshit. The server market in particular pushes demand hard now that everything is server based and yet, we are still here.

Where? Like I said, in the server market there are 18 core processors that you can scale up as high as you need to. It's not just demand, but also a lack of competition, AMD doesn't really pose a threat to Intel, and hasn't for awhile.

&gt; This is an issue of “easy gains.” The 90s and 2000s saw a massive burst of CPU performance and performance in most other markets simply because they were new enough to be able to use easy gains. Back then, it was as simple as decreasing the size of your lithography process and you could boost your clock speed and IPC without a problem. These days, the easy gains are over and we have serious difficulty in finding where we can boost performance, without losing the abstraction CPUs are useful for. We are reaching the limits of physics and I am already hella impressed by both AMD and Intel that they managed to push it so far. It will take a serious and drastic discovery, shift in the market, to start this up again.

Yes the ""easy gains"" may very well be over. This doesn't really matter all that much when Bitcoin QT isn't even optimized to use more than 10% of my 5 year old CPU, with no other bottlenecks in RAM or hard drive (SSD).

&gt; Same for hard drive market. First we made each sector smaller. Once we made it small enough to the point where we could count the atoms across each bit area. Then we started cramming platters like hell, bringing us to today, it’s hard to go smaller. The easy gains are over, now each upgrade requires a lot more thought for less gain.

The hard dive market is shifting to SSDs because of this. There's an enterprise 100 TB drive coming out soon, if not out already. But it doesn't matter how much Bitcoin is used, it won't need this amount of storage, as even Satoshi had stated from the beginning:

&gt;Once the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before it can be discarded to save disk space. To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash, transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [7][2][5], with only the root included in the block's hash. Old blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree. The interior hashes do not need to be stored.

&gt;A block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes. If we suppose blocks are generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year. With computer systems typically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of 1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in memory. 

This is how Bitcoin was designed, this is the whole purpose of using Merkle trees!

&gt; For graphics cards however, I see that we are indeed still in the days of easy gains. The market for high performance graphics isn’t as old as the others so it can work out.

Graphics cards aren't necessary for Bitcoin, but there could be ways to use them to compute things in addition to the CPU(s). This is completely unnecessary though.

&gt; Anyways, point is that demand can’t make miracles happen. 

Miracles don't need to happen, that's my point.

&gt;Your business isn’t going to be buying 5 petabytes worth of hard drives daily to keep up with a terabyte block blockchain.

Full 1 TB blocks would be 1 PB of storage per week, not 5 PB per day. Besides the fact that you don't need to store the whole blockchain unless you run a chain explorer or chainalysis company or something. 

I don't think we would ever have usage equivalent to Full 1 TB blocks. Full 1 TB blocks would be about 630 Billion tx per day, or 63 tx per person per day for ten Billion people. I don't know about you, but most people probably average less than 5 tx per day, and most of those in the western world are done on credit, which in the future would probably be a form of layer 2 with the current or new CC equivalent companies.

&gt;Your business could go out and buy a terabyte ram computer just as easily as my small business can buy the Empire State Building - it can’t.

I could have a server with 1 TB of ram, fully configured, with a warranty and everything, in less than a week. Currently around $30,000 with 16 x 64GB sticks. What will it be in 10-30 years, $2,000?

[You can get a 64 GB DIMM for $900 now.](https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=0RN-001J-00B18) What will it be in 10-30 years? $90? $9? What will we have, DDR 6-10, or some new technology?",1523824086

"We live in a world of near total fraud, that's what drew me into cryptocurrency. 

Almost every interaction we have in the real world AND non-crypto virtual world has some component of lies and deception. For example, when someone at a real world store asks you ""can I help you?"", they're usually not trying to help you. They're looking to see if you're up to something suspicious. They're also trained to say ""how are you?"", they don't actually care usually how you're doing, it's what they've been instructed to say. They're trying to not get fired, first and foremost. 

Nothing is real anymore in our society, there is massive isolation and detachment, I saw it earlier at the gym today. People stare at their phones or are listening to music, ""plugged in"" like Mark Zuckerburg was in the 2010 movie ""The Social Network"". 

In terms of fraud, those bankers that caused the 2008-early 2009 financial crisis were never punished. In fact, the banks are even bigger now and taking on even more risk via derivatives. We are all STILL nearly powerless against Goldman Sachs, Google, Facebook, and other massive monopolies.  If those companies don't take our money, then our own government will with taxes. If taxes don't take it, then the high cost of living(particularly where I live in the USA) will.

Cryptocurrency is one of the only ways we can fight back.

Every online site/tv program claims to be trying to service people in some way, but they're really just looking for hits/ratings/likes/attention. They view their ""target demographic"" as their victims, we are the suckers that they've sold their services to. We have gone from a service economy to an attention economy.

Politicians, sports players, people on tv, these people used to care about making change for the better, but now it's evident that they too are mostly just self-interested and just saying the right words in public to fit whatever political agenda they side with(Trump or anti-Trump), then in private they'll go back to doing whatever it takes to fill their own pockets. These celebrities used to be people to look up to, but not anymore. We don't really have role models or legendary figures, besides Satoshi Nakomoto.

Being invested in crypto is in many ways an attack on all institutions, and I'm happy to be part of it now. I wish I had gotten in earlier, I'm sure almost all of us here feel similarly.

(Sorry that was bit of a rant)

Anyone else feel similarly about why they're in cryptocurrency as me?",1523822917

Married with 2 kids combined income of 200k a year. About 530AM EST on Thursday morning  I invested into 1.4 BTC because it looked like it was going to jump and I figured afterwards I would exchange it all for Kin when it was at rock bottom I lost internet service for next 8 hours being in the mountains of Appalachia. When I got back into service I seen it jumped  way more than I ever could have ever imagined literally minutes after I invested. I'm still invested. I called a bull run 2 days before this as well seems as though that prediction was right as well.... I hope everyone here makes all the money they can because this is probably going to last until June...purely speculation though. Good luck all!,1523822849

"not sure what makes me a troll here, just because i question the bcache propaganda? but thank you (anyways) for being open to have normal discussions. 

it took me a minute to setup eclair wallet. the UE is basically the same as with bitcoin.com, or any other wallet for that matter. though i really think bitcoin.com sacrifices a lot of security by not forcing users to backup their seed. this will result in newbies loosing coins. great way of pushing adoption of your coin, frustrating users...  

so how exactly was the possibility of 0-conf removed from bitcoin? nobody will stop you from accepting 0-conf tx. but honestly, would you accept 0-conf payments for anything higher than 50$ on a regular basis? sounds like a bad business decision to make. 

what do you mean LN is not sending real bitcoin? what was i using to fund my channel? to use your words: i have an on-chain bitcoin transaction hash. one time on-chain now enables me to do as many tx i like to pay for small services online, instantly and trustless. ONE on-chain tx, even if that would cost me 35$ once (it didn't, i paid 3sat/byte to get included into the next block), i'd do it as it gives me the ability to forever transact at the cost of single satoshis per tx. why would i want to settle more often than let's say once a year? 

compared to that, BCH tx will look slow and expensive. other coins that implement LN will be able to do cross-chain atomic swaps, eliminating the need to use centralized KYC/AML exchanges to trade. bcache users will be left with these institutions or even more shady options. 

seriously, this is the way forward, away from centralized privacy nightmares like tippr and 0-conf insurances, or goddamn bitcoin.com, spying on its users. 

yes, there will be huge LN nodes with many channels. these will be real businesses with big userbases. of course you don't need such things if nobody uses your coin. 

how far would the internet have gone if infrastructure development had stopped at the base-layer, if all communication would have remained broadcast? what do you think would have happened if the solution to bigger demand of bandwidth would simply have been: add more copper. ",1523822781

"&gt; Why would the amount of currency circulating in the economy have no effect relative on price relative to demand when you've already acknowledged that if money sits in a vault and never moves anywhere it's as good as money that doesn't exist?

You need to understand the importance of the word ""never"".  When in the history of humanity has money sat in a value that remains accessible but persists **NEVER** being used.  If it truly is never used, that is one thing.  If it sits unused for a long time waiting for an opportunity for its holder to spend it, that is a very different situation.

&gt;If someone takes 100,000 bitcoins out of cold storage and puts them on the market, do you think that has no effect on the supply of bitcoins because its only bitcoins created that effect supply?

If the coins are sold, demand is reduced by the amount equal to the person holding 100k BTC but was previously unwilling to sell.  Obviously this would impact DEMAND, but not supply.


&gt;Why is hoarding money good for the economy?

You need to do some thinking on this question for yourself.  The resources are out there.  Try to come up with an answer and let me know if you have more specific questions.

&gt;Money only generates wealth by facilitating wealth generating trade. Money that never changes hands might as well not exist.

Suppose you are a doctor with medical malpractice liability insurance that you pay $300/month for.  Now suppose that you save $250,000.  You may then be able to demonstrate sufficient financial health to self-insure and opt out of the malpractice liability insurance requirement.  This is an example where by money hoarded or not ""changing hands"" has produced a quantifiable economic gain for the holder.

You're welcome.

I don't agree with the OP's potential earnings example because there are too many variables at play.  Depends on the size of the pool, the relative odds on each coin, et cetera.

For the scenario of 100 folks betting BTC (total 100 eth wagered) and 50 folks betting ETH (total 50 eth wagered), I think the maths work as follows:

Total pool:  150 ETH less 5% rake from Ethorse = 142.5 Eth

Winner of the race is BTC.  That means that 142.5 eth will be divided among the 100 folks who bet Eth in whatever % of the pot their bet represented. Assume that each person bet 1ETH, then they get 1.425 back, with .0425 ETH winnings as you point out.

"&gt; But that isn't what's happening. What's happening is, a big rush of small-time investors are treating it like a one-trick pony, and are handicapping both the broader utility and broader adoption in the process.

I think that's the narrative non-believers like to tell themselves, ""it's all dumb money, greedy and gullible fucks buying something they have no idea what is to try to 10x their USD"". I just don't think it's the truth.

Sure, a substantial portion of buyers, when it gets really frothy (as in late 2013 and late 2017) are absolutely these types of people, but I think a lot of them aren’t and for each hype cycle, more people “get it” and become holders longer term and start engaging in learning and building the ecosystem rather than looking at charts.

&gt;Frankly, Bitcoin posts these days are nearly as uninformed and toxic as essential oil or anti-vaxx posts...and they're often being promulgated by the same people.

There is always going to be a lot of price hype, people will celebrate it going up or try to get others to buy in. This is unavoidable. I tend to think the unscientific idiots gravitate to altcoins mostly. Especially the new ones claiming to be Bitcoin 3.0 etc.

&gt;This sub hasn't sunk to those levels, but it's also not exactly a wellspring of balanced thought and enlighted commentary either.

I agree, there are a lot of memes and shitposting here, but I don't think that's systemic to Bitcoin, there is plenty of technical discussion going on if you seek it out (there's a world outside of r/bitcoin). If you are only judging the Bitcoin community from a single subreddit, you won't get a good picture. I personally prefer twitter because I can follow people that have proven to be rational and intelligent (whether I agree with them or not) and if discussion degenerates too much into dumb shit it's easy to curate.

&gt;All your links shows is how the 'fuck you, Imma get mine' attitude has taken over Bitcoin...as an investment. People want to get rich, not establish a new revolutionary means of paying for things.

That's a false dilemma, wanting to increase your own purchasing power is perfectly compatible with wanting to see a monetary revolution. The genius of Bitcoin is that either will do.

&gt;And until they do the second, they're just going to continue to get fleeced by people with the money to manipulate values at will.

Noobs who try to trade this stuff surely will get fleeced. Hopefully they learn from that and stop trying to trade and just hold whatever they can afford to lose. Thankfully, I think most people learn from their mistakes.

&gt;Because while all crypto is still subject to the same market forces that any other currency is subject to, it has none of the regulatory protections that traditional markets have. 

That's the whole idea, Bitcoin is probably the closest thing you can get to an actual free market doing its thing.

&gt;It's a pure recreation of 19th century markets, routine bubbles and all.

Okay. If people worry that we're in a bubble they are probably over levered or buying for the wrong reasons (short term USD speculation).

There's a lot of ""think of the children"" going on with some of these arguments, as if Bitcoin will burglarize people and it's a travesty that they aren't protected. At the end of the day buying Bitcoin is voluntary, I'm a fan of personal responsibility, learning from mistakes and helping spread sound investment advice (with Bitcoin TL;DR: buy only for what you can afford to lose and prepare yourself for volatility).

I do agree that there has been and still is a lot of *really* dumb overly speculative money in this space and it has been healthy with a reality check in the form of a large correction.",1523819876

"I send my BTC to a Wanchain locked Bitcoin account.  The private key to this account is controlled by a network of verification nodes (nodes that run both a Bitcoin node and a Wanchain node on the same server).

The nodes issue me BTC' tokens on Wanchain.  Imagine if Ethereum had BTC-ERC20 tokens that could be trustlessly redeemed for real BTC.  I can trade the BTC' on a DEX, send it to a crowdsale smart contract, deposit it in a lending smart contract, send it through a ring signature transaction.

Now imagine if they connect to more blockchains and you could send BTC-ERC20, NEO-ERC20, XMR-ERC20 through ring signatures or trade them on a DEX like Kyber.  Then anyone can trustlessly redeem the tokens for real BTC, NEO, XMR.",1523819797

"1-volatility. You're wrong. It's volatile because it's in its infancy. If it survives long term it will be less volatile because it will be well established. I don't really consider this debatable either. You could debate it won't survive long enough sure, but to say it will never stop being volatile makes no sense. It either goes to 0 and becomes stable or it goes to an appropriate value and becomes stable.

2-old banks and such will still create lending platforms. There will be crypto insurance. And there will be money loaning. It just won't be free. But that's fine. Pay for the service if you want protection or don't.

3-see 2. Entities will exist that can offer lots of usability at a cost.

4-fair. Most coins aren't fungible. So maybe you could argue some coins won't be able to achieve worldwide adoption but there are fungible coins.

5-agreed. But this is no different then banks. The government can track your bank payments. And again, an entity could easily intermediate to obscure it from your every day Joe if not the government. So it's not different than real currency.

6-yeah garbage block chains won't make it I agree. But good fast block chains will.

7-i kind of think you're just shilling monero now. But to answer it, okay it hasnt been adopted for payments yet. Because btc is a slow expensive archaic block chain. Doesn't mean a better coin won't be adopted in the future.

"&gt; Why would you make a purchase if in 6 months time it will be cheaper? Deflation is a well understood topic and it's mostly negative for an economy.

Somehow I don’t think people in the western world having more buying power will turn us into disciplined savers and grind the economy to a halt. We’ve experienced products falling in value over time in different industries for it to benefit both the industry and the consumer. And there’s also a good argument to be made that inflation distorts the value of investments, causing bubbles like home prices and stock prices by incentivizing undue risk, destabilizing these investments.

But that honestly all doesn’t even matter to the argument here. Even if a deflationary currency was bad for the world economy but good for the individual, individuals would make the selfish choice over the altruistic one. It might just be the “dystopian” (although I think not) reality that we’re hurtling toward.

&gt;The Bitcoin enthusiasts want to not spend it until mainstream adoption which by definition means people spending it like a normally currency; but no one is spending it because they're all worshipping this ""hodl"" meme.

For most in the first world, PayPal or credit cards make more sense for spending for now. But as long as there’s legitimate use cases where bitcoin is better, like remittances or purchasing from companies credit cards refuse to deal with, the price will rise as adoption continues / the supply locks up. Hodling is absolutely a speculation, but its basically a bet that there won’t be something better than bitcoin for those use cases as adoption spreads. Altcoins would be the most obvious threat, but bitcoin has a massive head start with its network effects / larger market cap and liquidity adding stability vs altcoins. 

On the surface bitcoin absolutely seems like a speculative bubble or mania, but when you really dig in, something big is up. Central banks and governments speaking positively about “blockchain technology” (whatever that actually means) and the financial world no longer laughing at, but admitting this seems to be something that’s here to stay, it’s getting hard to write of as fad or tulip mania. 

You don’t have to believe me, or pay any attention if you don’t want to, but I wouldn’t expect it to go away either. It’s either going to be a strange footnote in history or this is the beginning of the internet fundamentally disrupting the financial industry. It’s hard to overstate how big of a deal that might be to society. ",1523819353

"Which is of course exactly what it can be likened to when good ideas start spreading through populaces.  Bitcoin is fascinating in that this is the first time such a revolutionary idea has spread this rapidly and on such a global scale, thanks to that other good idea which freaked incumbents out called ""the internet"".

There's a great piece in Scientific American by Michael Shermer on all this called [When Ideas Have Sex](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/when-ideas-have-sex/)

"Most of you will downvote me for this shilling. WTC is not a shitcoin, and I'm not a whale who will make millions if you

time people were shilling everything. He deleted his post shortly after. It took me few days to scan the WTC and I was in. Mostly because the white paper was 70-80 pages long.

working product, it won't be just crypto project anymore. It will attract standard investors who have more money
than whole current crypto market itself.

Effectivly yes, you will have coins on both sides. Remember that a fork doesn't add more coins, it's only building a different perspective on where those tokens are at. Bch and BTC are sharing the same 21 million tokens, it's just different ledgers. 

For this fork, the old one will not be sticking around like the BTC split. I believe everyone is upgrading to the new software. I personally would recommend exchanging BTC to BCH, but not in Hope of catching coins to short. ",1523818141

All of my crypto friends in my group chat are doing the same as your friends. I educate them on market cycles and they all agree and understand it. They would rather just rack up Hypebeast clothing or credit card bills than invest.

-On average, you can expect race winnings to deliver between 2.5x and 3.5x your initial bet (minimum 0.01 ETH bet).

- If you happen to win sometime, a $525 bet can deliver about $1312,5 to $1837,5 per race. Or  you might lose 525 per race.

-Many people have been playing 3 hourly races per day and 1 24-hour race daily on the testnet (beta platform)

-Your daily winnings could be between -9999 and 525 USD per day for a 30-minute time commitment (the time it takes to study the markets and prepare your bet). (This assumes that you lose most of the races you play).

-Weekly earnings could be in the range of -$179 982-$525 (assuming 1 ETH bets and accounting for lost races)

-ETH is currently about $525 USD, which means you could earn from $9,450 to $18,375 per week but most likely you wont and just holding ETH gives you far more profits.

I don't need to provide all the variables because I don't have them all. But there is more to it than price.

"**Credit default swap**

A credit default swap (CDS) is a financial swap agreement that the seller of the CDS will compensate the buyer (usually the creditor of the reference loan) in the event of a loan default (by the debtor) or other credit event. That is, the seller of the CDS insures the buyer against some reference loan defaulting. The buyer of the CDS makes a series of payments (the CDS ""fee"" or ""spread"") to the seller and, in exchange, receives a payoff if the loan defaults. It was invented by Blythe Masters from JP Morgan in 1994.

Frankly, Bitcoin posts these days are nearly as uninformed and toxic as essential oil or anti-vaxx posts...and they're often being promulgated by the same people. The people on my Facebook that are hot on Bitcoin are the same people who comment on politics via Minions memes, and who post '1 like = 1 prayer' shit entirely without irony. This sub hasn't sunk to those levels, but it's also not exactly a wellspring of balanced thought and enlighted commentary either. 

All your links shows is how the 'fuck you, Imma get mine' attitude has taken over Bitcoin...as an investment. People want to get rich, not establish a new revolutionary means of paying for things. And until they do the second, they're just going to continue to get fleeced by people with the money to manipulate values at will. Because while all crypto is still subject to the same market forces that any other currency is subject to, it has none of the regulatory protections that traditional markets have.

"Your post raises several points that are current issues with current cryptos but I don't see anything that inherently can't be solved and won't allow general payment cryptos to be adopted. I'll go ahead and run through your points here, with my thoughts on each.


1. Cryptos are volatile, but it's also a very new market. This happens with new markets and yes it does suck when you can no longer afford a laptop that you could've had 2 weeks ago, but it won't stay this way forever.


2. Lack of chargebacks: projects like REQ are working on this already.


3. You need to be your own bank, which is part of the appeal to crypto enthusiasts. I've been saying for a while that I don't think crypto is going to replace fiat, and this is a good reason for it. But for millions and millions of tech-savy people who aren't scared of setting up a wallet, this isn't a big issue, which is why I see crypto becoming sort of the currency of the internet, not replacing debit and credit cards completely, but definitely taking a huge bite out of the market share. Remember, if 100 million people worldwide are using crypto regularly, that's still a shit ton of people.


4. Most are not fungible. This is true, but there's no guarantee that it'll stay this way. For all we know, the perfect crypto has yet to be created, so I don't think it's a valid point to bring up fungibility as a reason why crypto will fail as a general payment system when there's nothing inherent about crypto that makes them all non-fungible.


5. As I wrote in the above point, there's nothing that says it MUST be this way, that's just a problem with a lot of the current market leaders.


6. This is an issue specific to Bitcoin, but again it doesn't have to stay this way. I agree that the current use case for most cryptos is primarily speculation, but that doesn't mean it can only be used for that.


7. I agree, I think it is a huge issue that most are deflationary. I firmly believe that an economy needs to be based on an inflationary currency to survive, because capitalism needs to encourage people to spend money. But if we're talking about a group of tech-savy people/nerds from all over the world, even if it is made of tens of millions of people, I suppose it doesn't really NEED to be inflationary, especially if merchants either invest in crypto themselves or are willing to convert to fiat right away. It would encourage hoarding to an extent, but if the entire economy of a country isn't based on it, I don't think this is a big issue. Ideally the deflation would be small enough that speculation would be less rampant than it is now (because if $100 worth of BTC this year is only gonna be worth $102 next year, wouldn't you rather use different vehicles for investment?), or inflationary as you mention. I personally think if we want a single crypto to see truly massive adoption, like VISA-level adoption, then yes it would need to be inflationary, but most people in crypto wouldn't be too happy about that because it likely won't make them lots of money (myself included, if I'm being honest).",1523812421

"A new money will never become SoV, MoE and UoA from day one, it's a lengthy process and Bitcoin has already come far from being a fringe ""fun collectible"" for nerds to being considered judgement and censorship resistant store of value and inflation hedge by a lot of people. 

Digital gold I think is the best analogy of what it is slowly becoming - it's obviously the early days and price volatility is unavoidable. Nothing grows like Bitcoin has grown in a linear fashion, it's simply impossible with human psychology.

People generally think way too much in USD price terms and miss the exciting part: Bitcoins emission curve. 

This is the first ever experiment in practically unstoppable and verifiable, extreme digital scarcity. It's unlike anything we've seen before it, so it is hard to make sense of intuitively. I think if people forgot about the price in USD completely, backed up and tried not to bring their preconceived ideas of money with them, detractors that are honest with themselves would find themselves a lot less cocksure in declaring it an inevitable failure.

This is what I think, I know there are no guarantees in investing or in life in general. I'm not going to try to convince you that Bitcoin can be sound money, it's fine that you disagree. I don't think Bitcoin will become less polarizing anytime soon, but it doesn't really need to be that to succeed. It just need an inflow of people with without deeply entrenched ideas, ask some fundamental questions about money and come to a similar conclusion that many have already, that this is a huge improvement over fiat moneys. The vehement detractors chomping at the bit to call it a failure and declare it dead, has if anything, been very helpful in spreading it due to the Streisand effect.

I'll leave you with an article from early 2014 that counters the ""you need to spend your Bitcoins to help grow the ecosystem, ""hodling""/hoarding it is bad"", it's a fun read, fairly concise and it should at the very least help you understand the logic of ""hodlers of last resort"" and how SoV predates MoE.

"If I want to get paid cash electronically. I have to go through a third party, (bank or some other money processing service). Bitcoin will eliminate this. In seconds I could have my funds 100% secured into my personal wallet and in seconds spend it. 

Why would someone *want* to get paid in BTC? Well if the value is slightly going up, say 2% year, sure I'll take it. If it gives me 100% control sure I'll take it. If it's as easy as, click I made a wallet, now please deposit my money, sure I'll take it - no need to setup a bank account. I can spend it in seconds, convert to other crypto, pay bills more efficiently, just wave my phone over a vending machine with a QR code and buy snacks. Bitcoin will make transacting much easier and efficient. We are living in a digital world, money is inevitably going digital - and decentralized money spent across boarders will be in more demand. 

As of now lots of ideas are being put forth to design systems that make everything simple, safe, efficient. It's not going to happen overnight, and that's why right now its best to invest cause its dirt cheap. If bitcoin hits a very high price, volatility will greatly reduce. If it were to break $1mil a coin I doubt we would see 10% swings a day, more like 0.1% a day, but at that high of a value it would more likely slowly rise than ever drop massively.

Is that a Bitcoin Cash address?,1523808879
If bitcoin hit that alt coins would be worth much more but still lag behind it significantly. It will be interesting to see how Bitcoins role in the crypto market evolves. It is clearly the leader now and if it hit 1 million it would mean that bitcoin stays entrenched as the top coin in the crypto world. My personal opinion is for this to happen bitcoin will need to establish a use beyond speculative investment. As crypto markets mature in general  coins that have no use other then speculation will start to die off. (Probably years away still) So if btc hits a million many alt coins will probably be worth roughly what they are worth today these are ones that haven’t been able to establish wide adoption and have no real use. A select few will be able to establish a foothold in the wider market or have a compelling use these will be the coins that will appreciate with btc. That being said if btc ever hits 1 million I think it will be as much because of the depreciation of the USD as it is the appreciation of bitcoin .,1523808845

"verge is the ONLY privacy coin that gives u access to a choice between public and private coin transfers. Also, verge has a large supply of coins, that makes it easier for mass market adoption. Verge has one of the fastest transfer speeds in all other privacy coins. Verge has one of the lowest fees for transfers. Verge has no central control as it was never premined, never prefunded through ICO. Verge isnt just an idea on a paper(like most coins) , its actually an existing and working product that is constantly getting improved as time goes on. There is a reason behind why verge marketing and pr sucks balls. Thats bcuz non of them are getting paid for what they do. Its a community driven and supported coin hence why the crowdfund. Most alternative coins have central control or have been premined, so ofc they have the funds to hire marketing and pr talents. I for one refuse to believe that The verge team would chose to exit scam at 9cents, when they couldve done so when it was at 30cents. Why would they make a new website, launch a new wallet, get listed on crypto emporium, consistently add new merchants that accept verge as a currency, have tokkenpay donate 90% of the amouny to the crowdfund just to exit scam? It doesnt make fcking sense. Ill agree on a couple things though. 1:verge Pr and marketing team sucks balls and at times are very unprofessional. 2:they never meet their deadlines but they always deliver at the end. 3: the verge community are fanatics.

"Most of these comments are pretty short. I'm interested in reading some stories. So here's mine. 



I missed the ""gold rush"" of the summer of 2011 but started mining on and off when I got my HD 6950. But I didn't expand much because even the most efficient $/MH cards weren't worth the purchase because it would still take 5+ months to pay them off. Started mining litecoin mid-2012 and immediately exchanging it for bitcoin. Was ok for CPU mining back then. I added a Radeon 5830 for 24-h mining on a spare board with the board box as the case. It went down for 2 weeks that December when two Kingston USB sticks failed (my primary and my hot-swap spare) and I decided to study for exams instead of writing BAMT to a new USB. 



I almost spent it all on a laser pointer online at a shop in early 2012 when I still didn't have such confidence in Bitcoin. I wanted to see a store transaction. I went with the wrong company for mining preorder - BFL. With some lucky doubling down, I managed to make all my money back plus a bit. Fun but less effort had I not gotten involved in the first place. 



In early-mid 2013, I mined litecoin with the same video cards as I used to mine Bitcoin. Didn't sell it for Bitcoin. Got in on a small KNC miner with a partner and made a small profit or at least broke even. We ordered another one but it was late. Fortunately, KNC was doing refunds in Bitcoin but denoted in USD. Price went down a bit from purchase date and fortunately managed to make a bit of coin on it.



At some point in 2014 or 2015, I packed my last miner in a box because it was making virtually nothing. The end of Bitcoin accumulation. HODLed by sticking my head in the sand until the most recent bubble.



So I've been HODLing since late 2011. I missed too many opportunities. But I consider myself lucky because at the same time, I made back what I lost from any mistakes (like BFL). The biggest regret, of course, comes from early 2012 after my ""aha"" moment with crypto. Someone suggested I put $1k into it at $4 if I believed in it. I didn't put my money in because I felt invested enough by hobby mining. Having not yet had a full-time job (or even part time much above minimum wage) and not being a person to take risks, it seemed like a lot of money. That could have been 250BTC.



But I am happy to have a position and continue to HODL. I sold a tiny bit near the high in December. These days, selling Bitcoin feels more risky than buying it to me. I will probably always HODL the majority. ",1523807938

"You're a known troll, but I'll respond once anyways:

The total time to send BCH was less than one minute, 10 seconds of that to send, after the other 50 seconds were spent downloading the bitcoin.com app.

Try doing that with the Lightning Network. It would take hours/days to get a new user setup with a full node, then that user would need to connect to a centralized hub. Your LN IOU would artificially send in 1 second, but it's just an IOU, it's not real Bitcoin. That user wouldn't be able to see that transaction on a blockchain anywhere, it's not final until settled. I have an on-chain BCH transaction hash, you don't. 

LN transactions are just IOUs until settled on-chain and sadly, when people actually start using BTC/BitcoinCore the on-chain settlement ends up costing $35-50 or more. You can thank the shitty BitcoinCore developers and their 1mb floppy disk blocksize for that.

I didn't send my friend an IOU, I sent him verifiable Bitcoins (BCH). My friend would not have been interested in BitcoinCore or the long and confusing setup, but right now he's a Bitcoin Cash user.",1523807323
"It's somewhat arbitrary.  Currently, a miner earns a block of 12.5 BTC roughly every 10 minutes.  Not each miner... One in the world.  There are 1440 minutes in the day, so 144*12.5=1800 BTC per day are issued.   Also, roughly every four years, this rate is cut in half, so sometime in 2020, the rate will go to 900/day then in 2024, 450/day, etc.  It is for hopes to earn this reward that people run mining nodes.  A key part of Bitcoin working is that validation of the system is rewarded like this.  The mining work is what gives Bitcoin many of its properties. 

Keep in mind, 1 BTC can be broken into 100 million parts, as a dollar breaks into 100 pennies.  You can transfer amounts of value much smaller than the price of 1 BTC. ",1523807315

"Not having a central bank to manage the monetary supply introduces a different set of issues though. As I understand it, Bitcoin is deflationary by nature. There's a finite amount and that number will slowly decrease as people lose access to their wallets etc. If mass adoption does begin to occur the value of Bitcoin will rise even more. A currency that becomes more valuable as time goes on is not one that people will want to spend which is a massive problem and causes the economy to grind to a halt. The reason central banks exist is to tackle these exact sorts of issues.

And regarding your point of having the same sorts of customer services that we currently have only for Bitcoin rather than fiat currencies, I agree. That in my eyes would be the best outcome but it totally negates several of the benefits the Bitcoin enthusiasts talk about. If we had those services we'd still have longer transaction times for clearing/fraud prevention, possibly extra transaction fees and there'd still be a middle-man you'd have to trust. The only real benefit would be that the supply would not be controlled by a central bank.",1523805220

While some countries have explicitly allowed its use and trade, others have banned or restricted it.

"Nice copy and paste job of a previous post.

I believe you have an agenda as proven by your post history.

Much of that post is no longer relevant as the evidence such as the video was made 6 months ago and many changes have been made during that time. Management has changed. Mistakes have been made and they have been admitted to.

We are not a perfect project. No project is. But I can tell you one thing... We have around 50 team members that work their balls off on this project every day. We have come a long way from a slack with 20 people. Since you claim to have been around for that long I am curious what your slack handle was back then. I was in the slack 2 Under the same name. So perhaps we can chat and you can provide some constructive ways in which you think the project should move.

We are always open to suggestions from the community. As evidence, I submit the recent change to the giveaway that the community did not like so we are switching it to a bounty program.

But all of this constant posting of regurgitated content reeks of an agenda of your own. 

Again much of what is in this post is now largely irrelevant because management and the team has changed so much. We now have branding guidelines. We now have code of conduct. We have a Litany of things we did not have at the time of much of the so called evidence in your post.

"Hi Andrea, 

Thank you for the detailed reply. On reddit, you can reply to parent comments by hitting 'reply' so they remain contextualized, rather than creating a new top-level comment entirely. The nested structure lets the conversation flow logically. 

I really appreciate the summation! It's very gratifying to see the model vindicate ideas that are informally held about bitcoin. 

&gt; One in which the fundamental value of bitcoins is zero. If, however, network trust increases “fast enough” near a price of zero, an equilibrium with a strictly positive price exists. can also be shown to exist if at least some agents in the economy values censorship resistance.

I think this is a tremendously important finding. It has often said that bitcoin works in practice and not in theory. I'm not too familiar with other work on the topic but my understanding is that there are few or no economic models which find a positive value for bitcoin in equilibrium. This is an interesting way to describe the ""trust bootstrapping"" that happened in the early days of bitcoin.

&gt; Perhaps counterintuitively, the price decreases with the marginal cost of mining, which is driven by factors such as electricity costs, due to the reduction in the equilibrium network trust (measured in hashrate), thus reducing the bitcoin valuation.

This makes sense to me. Since Bitcoin is premised on predictability in terms of the cost to mining and the resultant clarity in determining the cost to reverse a transaction, a degradation in that predictability might affect trust in the network. If an ASIC was invented which was a 1000x speedup on latest hardware, accumulated PoW would ""leak"", as those proofs would be cheaper to revert, relative to the cost to have made them in the first place. 

&gt; Thus, high volatility in expectations on network size will translate into high price volatility.

Nice to see this confirmed, makes perfect sense as it is a general feature of asset valuation.

Your comment on price-hashrate spirals in the paper is interesting. It does make intuitive sense that if price and hashrate are tightly interlinked and have a reflexive relationship on the way up (price rises catalyze new hashrate, additional hashrate increases trust which bolsters price), that the same can be true on the way down. I think bitcoin's slow difficulty adjustment helps mollify this. 

This is very exciting to read now that I've understood what the paper does. I'm glad you took the time to communicate the findings, there is often a huge gap between academia and industry, and this kind of discussion, even if it seems informal, is tremendously helpful. ",1523803664

Bitcoin is more a social movement than anything.

People have become too dependent on institutions and this is why the entire economy has gone to shit. People do not know how to have personal responsibility and perpetuating ignorance is...well, ignorant. People are meat computers with the capacity to LEARN. 

I've seen a monkey learn how to make a fire and cook marshmallows on a stick. If a monkey can learn how to do something like that, I don't see why people can't learn how to take control of their own assets/private keys. It's really not that much harder than having a bank account log-in. Copy+paste - there's no need to remember everything like people try to remember their bank accounts.

"Exactly, no one forces a bait and switch on its victims.  Bait and switch is illegal because it's fraudulent behavior.  In the case of Bitcoin Core, the ""bait"" is a revolutionary, disruptive payment architecture.  The ""switch"" is Lightning Network, or bank transfers as you described it, i.e., essentially, the same old managed architecture that is already in existence.   Here are some FTC guidelines for recognizing a bait and switch:

&gt; If the seller does not intend to sell you the “bait,” and does any of the following in the course of selling other merchandise, then it’s probably the “bait and switch”:
&gt;* Disparages the bait or its warranty, credit terms, availability of service, repairs or parts.
&gt;* Employs compensation methods that discourage or penalize sales people for selling the bait.
&gt;* Refuses to take orders for the bait.
&gt;* Refuses to make delivery of the bait within a reasonable time period.
&gt;* Shows you a broken or defective product.
&gt;* Fails to meet anticipated demand for the bait without disclosing the bait’s limited availability in the ad.
&gt;* Fails to stock all outlets with the bait in the quantity specified in the ad.
&gt;

While all of these sound familiar in the context of Bitcoinb Core, a couple in particular stand out:

- Refuses to take orders for the bait.
The transaction rate limit implemented on BTC chain is the refusal to take orders.

- Shows you a broken or defective product.
The mempool under demand having slow, unreliable confirmations and extremely high fees is the defective product that pushes people toward Lightning Network (the ""switch"").

I’m not saying this will happen in the next 6 months, but definitely in our lifetimes. Insane volatility is inherent in low market cap products.

"&gt; A private key is not a seed of any sort, so no, you can't generate an xpub from a private key.

This isn't true. With an Xpub and any single private key descended from it, an attacker can easily derive the rest of the private keys. This is a well-known security weakness with using xpubs. 

From [BIP 32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki): 

&gt; One weakness that may not be immediately obvious, is that knowledge of a parent extended public key plus any non-hardened private key descending from it is equivalent to knowing the parent extended private key (and thus every private and public key descending from it). This means that extended public keys must be treated more carefully than regular public keys. It is also the reason for the existence of hardened keys, and why they are used for the account level in the tree. This way, a leak of account-specific (or below) private key never risks compromising the master or other accounts.

It's been replaced by fiat as a currency due to a couple of your points, it being difficult to transport, secure and verify in everyday transactions.

"@isrly_eder
Thanks! Here is a quick summary of the setup and key findings.

This article provides the first equilibrium framework to address the question of what is the fundamental value of bitcoins. On the demand side, we assume that consumers value the consumption of services in a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) trustless network that has the property of being censorship resistant. On the supply side, the miners, who provide computing resources that affect the network’s trustworthiness (“trust” hereafter) need to be incentivized to do so. In the emerging equilibrium, bitcoins serve two functions: an incentive to miners and a token to conduct exchanges to consumers. The value of the token is the solution of a fixed-point problem that characterize the interaction of miners and consumers. 
We find that two equilibria exist. One in which the fundamental value of bitcoins is zero. If, however, network trust increases “fast enough” near a price of zero, an equilibrium with a strictly positive price exists. can also be shown to exist if at least some agents in the economy values censorship resistance. 
1.	The price increases with the number of network participants and the average censorship aversion value. Furthermore, if consumers expect a higher (lower) network size in the future, the market clearing price increases (decreases) today. 
2.	Thus, high volatility in expectations on network size will translate into high price volatility. 
3.	Equilibrium prices can display (perfectly rational) volatility spirals. 
4.	Perhaps counterintuitively, the price decreases with the marginal cost of mining, which is driven by factors such as electricity costs, due to the reduction in the equilibrium network trust (measured in hashrate), thus reducing the bitcoin valuation. 
6.	The price increases in the number of miners. In the limit, when mining is perfectly competitive, we show that the cost of mining a bitcoin is a constant proportion of the price and that proportion only depends on the curvature of the cost function and not on other supply-side parameters.
7.	Finally, there exists an optimal “monetary policy”. The price is not monotonic in the inflationary reward offered to miners. For small values of the reward, bitcoin injections increase the incentive for miners to provide trust; however, above a given threshold, the effect becomes negative due to the debasing influence of bitcoin inflation. The model thus implies an “optimal monetary policy” regarding an inflation rate that maximizes the market capitalization of Bitcoin. This is relevant for those designing decentralized coin-based ecosystems.

"You have received some troll replies. /u/DeAngeloLT is full of shit; Coinbase is an exchange and you don't 'download' their service to trade with them.


&gt; Can you obtain bitcoin without paying any money? How? 

Sure, the same way you obtain anything else without paying for it. You get it gifted to you.

&gt; How do you convert the bitcoin into real cash/usd?

With an exchange, they are just like any other currency exchange only a bit more accessible to the public. I don't know your locality, so I don't know which exchange will service you best.

&gt;  If I want to gamble with bitcoin, what are reputable online casinos?

Some reputable *non*-crypto sites accept crypto now. You're not likely to find much information about gambling here on Reddit, though.

"I tend to think that we will see periods like this more and more but will continue to have bears in between.

December 2017 changed a lot of stuff for the market with the introduction of newcomers who are treating crypto very differently than it was treated prior to that time.

In my opinion, we’re seeing large amounts of people exit the market after each bull run because they’ve lost hope in crypto. They never imagined they would have to wait this long. The first bear started because mass amounts of newcomers expected to be lambo owners in a single night. When that wasn’t the case, they sold what they invested minus the loss and never planned on coming back. Then you had other people who wanted to but couldn’t because they didn’t want to take a loss on their initial investment. As soon as the market came up by any percentage, they dumped what they had, either taking a smaller loss, a very small profit that was likely lost to fees, or came out even. Now we’re getting to a point where it’s just the hodlers who are still here and not willing to leave yet. The ones who are really in it for the long run, years to decades, and others who are willing to hodl as long as possible until they make a substantial profit.

So the market is able to grow more because we are seeing less people dumping. We will see a bear again very soon, though. There will come a time in this bull run that more of those non-hodlers will see profits of any size and will be ready to exit then and it will cause another crash. May not be a big crash or one that lasts too long, though. Not as long as this last one has been from January to a few days ago in April.

I tend to think you’re right. We’re not out of the woods yet but I am enjoying seeing more green in my portfolio now.",1523800024
"“Bronze swords have thousands of years demonstrating the superiority.” Said the man who was shortly thereafter killed by a steel sword.

Gold is a worthless rock whose properties are shared between a dozen other metals. The only reason gold is a world standard is that everybody accepts it. It’s purely psychological and gold has no actual inherent value outside of electronics use, which again a dozen other metals also share. 

Crypto WILL replace gold, a few years before it replaces fiat currency. Bitcoin is better than gold in several ways where gold is better than bitcoin in one which is worldwide adoption.

- gold is difficult to transport
- gold is difficult to divide
- gold is difficult to verify authenticity/ easy to fake

"OK, so if you already knew at the time you posted that chart, that Dell and Valve had stopped accepting Bitcoin in 2017 and that Edeka was only one independent franchisee, who had also already stopped, then it seems very disingenuous to still include these companies in your 2018 listing. They are not ""Expected changes in 2018"", they had already changed.

And I'd still like some more background on those other listings. As I said, an independent dealer doing his own payments thing does not qualify as ""Company with more than $1 billion in revenue who accept Bitcoin"". For the casual reader of your posts, it paints a wrong picture and I'm pretty sure you know that.

For example, I remember the Braintree announcement a while ago. While that's already a bit of a stretch to just say ""Paypal accepts Bitcoin"", I just had a look at the Braintree site and [don't see Bitcoin as one of their ""almost any way to pay""](https://www.braintreepayments.com/features) anymore, and [can't find any other mention of Bitcoin](https://articles.braintreepayments.com/?q=bitcoin). 

Look, we all want adoption to grow. It might be tempting to cling onto all kinds of inaccurate proxies to show what you want to see. But you don't need questionable estimates where ""no one knows the real figure"" and misleading company listings (what does it even mean for adoption if they accept it and nobody uses it?). There is a much easier way to look at it - the blockchain. Just look at the value in fiat transacted every day over the Bitcoin network, simple as that:

"Bitcoin isn’t about replacing trust in banks, it’s about replacing trust in central banks. There’s no reason you couldn’t have the same consumer protections banks have in bitcoin as the market matures, if you chose to use a custodian for your wallet. 

One of the major advantages of bitcoin is your money doesn’t get inflated out of existence over the long term. And for now the value is rising quickly as adoption is far outpacing the inflation schedule of bitcoin. Meanwhile holding governemnt cureency is a guaranteed 1-3% loss compounding annually.

* sell 100 eth ($100/eth) - **10k loss**

I wish these companies would stop labeling this as being an exchange, it's fairly confusing for the average user.

Totally agree - in that who can challenge low fee's, he is right in that regards.
But, what I'm saying is that once the problems with Bitcoin Core get fixed the fee's will be just as, or even cheaper than Bitcoin Cash and much-much faster tx's, safer and higher volumes of tx's with high granularity + huge potential if coupled with smart contracts.

The high fee's in Core are only a temp problem, and shouldn't be used as the pinnacle argument for Bitcoin Cash.

Just because Bitcoin Core might have issues with LN and payment channels 'today' doesn't mean it will have issues 'tomorrow' - it is only natural obstacles in software development - again shouldn't be used to argue Bitcoin Cash, when they too will have obstacles and from what I can tell even greater obstacles than Bitcoin Core.

"Guys guys guys... I've tried to help you out the last couple days. The market has changed. You are all my crypto brothers, even if you have lost your ways to the darkness.

The bear season lasted 3 months, and you are all waiting for a 2 year bear season. The thing is, adoption has happened slowly, in tiny little pieces since the 2014 crash. Stop trying to use past performance to predict the future. So many people know about crypto now, it's not the same at all. There's so much tether and fiat sitting on exchanges just trying to time the dip. 

That dip was 3 days ago.

Stop looking at spikes and calling organic or inorganic growth. We all have a tendency for recency bias. The market dumped 70-85%, how much further would ""make you happy""? This thing isn't going to zero, no matter how much uncle Heathroy on Facebook tells you it will.

Remember why you joined. You joined to change the world, and be part of the ground floor grass roots movement. That movement is now leaving without you.

Even with recent runs, we're still at the lowest prices we'll ever see. Don't be that guy who doesn't buy $1200 BTC because he's waiting for it to fall back to $500. It never did, and we'll never see $6k BTC ever again.

The difference? Not the spikes up and down... look at the baseline movement. It's almost completely positive. It's positive DESPITE people shorting it and trying to swing it down. It's positive DESPITE people thinking this is a bulltrap and tethering up. Downwards spikes are getting absorbed in 10-20 mins. Sundays aren't blood red anymore. Daily crypto thread comments are 2k by noon. Subscriptions on the sub appears to be rising too. Positive sentiment comments (even as stupid as YAY MOON) are being upvoted. Guys it's ANNOYING but it's EYE OPENING. SENTIMENT HAS CHANGED. 

Try it out... go post in this thread that we're in a bulltrap and see what happens. You will get downvoted to oblivion. If you posted that 3 days ago, you would have been top post in the thread.

As much as that is ""people delusioned that we're in a bull market"" according to the most pessimistic out there, what it really is is an indicator of market sentiment. A weak one, but they are ALL AROUND YOU. Open your eyes, and stop trying to time a floor that isn't coming.

As much as buy buy buy into Dec/Jan was a TERRIBLE decision because FOMO kills, this is the START of a LONG bullrun. Continuing to try to do tether tricks and short the market, time a bottom that never comes... that stuff is going to KILL YOU. 

Now is the time to just get a ticket for the train and start posting Mr Bean train Gifs. The sad times are over. It's time for even the most negative of you out there to wake up, remember why you are here, hop on board, grab a nice coffee, and ENJOY the moonbois, enjoy the hype, enjoy the positivity that will explode throughout this sub in the next 6 months.

I really don't think the spikes are a bad/manipulating thing myself. It's just that big players are trading the markets at the moment with different viewpoints on where the prices are going to go with crypto. Every time an previous resistance is broken there's just an over demand because the one that believe the prices will go up are then buying aggressively because they think this really is a good opportunity to buy while at the same time the shorters are closing their positions because they can't handle the losses anymore or are changing their viewpoint on basis of the recent price development. Just my point of view. Expecting a change in sentiment to go slow and gradually is just not how these markets work.,1523793599

"- bitcoin is in the process of rapid growth in price and value. Volatility will fizzle out when the market cap it larger by several magnitudes from today. 

- Pay with escrow. I'm certain there will be businesses providing these services even for second layer solutions. 
- valid point

- improved by better tech on the base layer and by second layer solutions. Currently for bitcoin still a valid point. Important research area for CCs since current base layer solutions don't scale. 

- You don't have single addresses with current wallets, you have many. Also, there are solutions for that like coin join. 

- Second and third layer solutions fix this.

- The current situation is irrelevant for its future use. The possibility to use it as a payment option together with its other advantages like fixed supply and security is enough to drive its value and with growing saturation people will be more willing to spend the coins instead of hodling them. 

- This point is irrelevant. You might want to have bitcoin even if for some reason it means that the economy as a whole suffers. Prisoners dilemma. That said I'm not so sure whether a deflationary currency is even bad. I'll ponder about it after reading ""the bitcoin standard"", which I'll get at the end of the month. ",1523791811

Capital gains is your initial investment minus your gains which would be $9,000 that you will be taxed on. That is what you have to pay taxes on. Now If you invest that $9,000 into Verge and lose all but $1,000, too bad you still owe taxes on the $9,000. What I am going to do once I make profit (I got in early January before the crash) is If I make $1,000 profit (capital gains) I pull out my tax money which would be $300 (roughly 25% federal and 3% state) and pull it out of crypto into my bank. That way, if my remaining $700 crashes, I don't care as I already payed my taxes on it. You can deduct up to $3,000 a year as losses, but that is the max.

I doubt it's done dumping. Bottom seems to be around 0.05 BTC, but if BCH really drops so low, coins like LTC would take over, and $10 or $2 BCH isn't impossible.

I don't think people will be willing to do that once the LN is big enough, but I would love to be wrong.

&gt; You purchase with FIAT, Coinbase sends funds already in LN to your LN wallet - ZERO on chain TX. The whole point is that funds ""locked"" in LN can be transfered between parties multiple times (like see-saw) whoult on-chain tx.

Why would Coinbase have more BTC in its channel towards me than I originally purchased? They would have to top-up, unless they ""just in case"" pre-funded the channel with 100 BTC on opening, and now are just waiting for additional purchases from me.

"&gt; channel is between LN nodes that route payments: in such case to unbalance a channel fees can be dropped to zero (and even to be negative) for payments in the other direction. This will incentivise network to use this path and re-distribute funds.

You're optimistically assuming people will want to have their nodes at 0 or negative fees.

&gt; channel is between SPV wallet (mobile app) and LN node and LN node has all the funds (no way to pay with this channel from app): in such case user might go to Coinbase (or other exchange), purchase btc with fiat and set it directly to LN channel - this will re-balance it

Just because you're not sending the TX doesn't mean there isn't one.

"Man, I am not from US, but I'm pretty sure the like-kind tax law only applies from 2018. People here trying to scare you into believing IRS will come back to haunt you for past trades are just wrong.

There are easier ways to to this.

A strong pass-phrase, such as ""This is from crypto_m3rchant for little John"" is anyway much easier to type than half a private key.

Keep in mind that if all of your crypto trading was confined to a single financial year, and you cashed out fully at the end, you could use the ""fiat in - fiat out = capital gains"" formula, and it would be the same number that you would get if you did all the record keeping that you're asked' to do. In fact, it would be slightly higher, because you didn't get to deduct things like trade fees, but the IRS is more than happy to have you pay more tax than you owe, so they would have no reason not to accept it.

It's a completely different issue and I think it's important not to conflate the two if we want Bitcoin to really win.

Even if I know I don't own my money when I save it to my bank, I still use them because they're guarding my money, and it works well enough mostly.

Too many self-acclaimed libertarians don't truly understand why we have banks and governments and just mindlessly blame them, and I think that's very counter-productive thing to do.

"Haha, I just yesterday wrote this article: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Nuclear_war_and_Bitcoin . Don't worry, you can keep your BTC safe even if the world is reduced to a smoking ruin!

I didn't include price speculation in that article, but I think that the BTC/USD price would continually go up as war approaches, since BTC would probably be perceived as more resilient if the US government is in danger of being damaged/destroyed/destabilized by war. However, once nuclear war seems downright *likely*, I'd expect the value of both BTC and USD to collapse in real terms. You don't really want imaginary numbers in a ledger/account in the aftermath of a nuclear war; you want water, food, ammunition, and *maybe* precious metals.

Also, I always like to remind people when talking about nuclear war that unless you live in a large city, you very much *can* survive a nuclear war. Don't expect to just immediately be vaporized; more people will probably die from preventable fallout radiation or starvation rather than from the blasts themselves. Amusingly, FEMA just 2 months ago put out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiQ4u5yZHoM) on how to survive a nuclear attack, which is in fact a correct summary of the bare essential knowledge.",1523787543

Put it this way: which world currency would you trust parking $1,000,000 for 50 years for your heirs to eventually enjoy?  

The Euro that is younger than I am?  

The UK pound, which was on the brink of collapse from two world wars just decades ago?  

Perhaps the Kuwaiti Dinar, that has the strongest exchange value in the world!  No chance in hell of collapse there, Saddam.  

Maybe the Chinese RMB?  That was pegged directly to the USD only a few presidents ago, and was toilet paper only a few more presidents ago.  I can't imagine why they all like dollars and bitcoin over there.

In fact, I can't imagine why nobody in any country will turn down the USD.  Personally my choice for a ""strong"" currency would only include the Swiss Franc, because my idea of ""strength"" consists of not just value stability but ""good luck invading it will never happen"" and/or ""good luck invading, we will fucking destroy you"" to ensure continued stability.",1523787465

I just realised my losses, before the end of the tax year.

You've missed the window now, but that's what you should have done too. Even if all you did was trade out to bitcoin, then back to whatever altcoin you had and taken the exchange's fee for it, this would have realised your losses, and you wouldn't have owed anywhere near as much in tax.

Also the comparison to gold is poor, gold has thousands of years demonstrating inherent value through scarcity, chemical stability, divisibility, cosmetic value, and more recently electronics. 

Bitcoin derives its value from speculation that it will be adopted for mainstream use. At that point it will derive it's value from its ability to buy things, just like USD.

Bitcoin will never be as stable as gold, but that shouldn't be a goal anyway, bitcoin doesn't fail if it doesn't replace gold.

Nothing about Bosch is fake. They have done official press releases themselves (not coming from IOTA, coming from Bosch) - just use google. They actually invested by buying the token, as well as partnerning for the technology/use cases.

The Chief Digital Officer of Volkswagen joined the IOTA Foundation.
The Head of Central Europe Fujitsu joined the IOTA Foundation.

These few partnerships/cooperations (and they have many more, such as with Taipei City, DCX, and many others) are GIANT. Between just these 3 (Bosch/VW/Fujitsu) you have pretty much the biggest players in IoT, autonomous driving, technology patents, etc...

All of this you can google and verify with official press releases and multiple sources.

The wallet works just fine. I've used it for many, many months and never had an issue. Any claims to lost funds etc. are because people used ONLINE PASSWORD GENERATORS that those websites then used to login to their seed. So, to put it bluntly: idiot user error.

"Volatility is due to excessive trading activity, once people spend crypto as it's primary usage, speculative trading will be reduced in terms of the overall % economic activity and will have minimal effect.

Businesses will prefer crypto over cards because of no charge backs and zero fees.  As a consumer you will still have rights under your local legal system to a refund if goods are poor quality or do not arrive etc.  Charge back fraud will vanish saving us all money.

Cryptos with limited supply are not the answer because they encourage hoarding, cryptos with unlimited supply do exist, it's the rate of inflation which is strictly controlled.  Gridcoin is an example, the supply is static, so the % of new coins decreases and would be neither inflationary or deflationary.

In terms of someone knowing your address after you send them money, and then knowing your balance.  If you put 10 coins into a wallet, but you put 1 coin into 10 addresses within that wallet, then your total balance is obfuscated.
Privacy coins like Monero will in all likelihood be made illegal.

Assuming governments accept crypto as a legitimate method to make payments, then we could expect to see methods for innocent parties to officially launder coins.  This would be like gun or knife amnesty that often occurs today.  Providing you explain how you innocently received tainted coins, they can be laundered and made good; you probably will have to tell the government the details of the person who paid you the coins though.
We can also expect to see addresses on the OFAC list and payments from those addresses to be locked and reported, or even payments from those addresses not being processed by miners/stakers in the mempool so they never complete.

That speaks volume! i wouldn't call that fake or meaningless. In the end, Bosch and Fujitsu probably have bigger insight and understanding than the two of us. don't you think?

and do you really think that only legit projects have working products? honestly mate, that is stupid. Every product was at some stage just an idea. IOTA is more than an idea though, and is fairly close to launching their product. You have to remember, this is not a stupid fork of BTC or the like. It is revolutionary technology that is build from scratch. It is an investment in the future. It is ok to say that you don't believe in the project, but calling it a scam and claiming that only projects with a working product is legit is outright stupid. Step up your game!

With ~1300 transactions. I tried to day trade on gdax and initially put in maybe $10,000 buying BTC and some ETH and have ~3 bitcoin now. So ~$24,000. I’ve only cashed out ~$2,000 so far (moved it to my bank account). In my actual job I make around $29,000/yr. I can’t possibly have to pay taxes on $8,000,000, right?

"I posted this over in the other subreddit too. In order of what you said:

* Volatility has to go away. I agree. Immediate cashing out to fiat is not a solution. That could happen, it could not. Unknown.

* Chargebacks are a feature that could theoretically exist. They just don't, currently. But there could theoretically be a new crypto-currency that integrates some sort of chargeback functionality. I don't see why you couldn't do some sort of chargeback smart contract on ETH. Or EOS's arbitration functionality. Or there could be replacements, e.g. decentralized per-purchase insurance. The concept of refunds or being able to recover money is not an unsolvable problem. It just doesn't happen to be something anyone seems to be implementing, probably because this is still such a nascent tech sector.

* Your point on being your own bank and its difficulty for tech illiterates and its inherent risk: This is a UI issue primarily. Can and must be solved in the future for mass adoption. As for people losing their keys or wallet access, yes that is an issue. Again though, nothing stopping decentralized options to secure your wealth analogous to the functions banks or insurance now provides.

* Your point on ""fungibility."" Not quite sure how this is an issue. Maybe I'm misunderstanding it. If you sold some drugs and then bought a pizza, the pizza place is in the clear whether its cash or BTC.

* Yes rich lists are an issue with lots of current currency coins. But not something another coin can't fix.

* You have some BTC specific problems, as you note these are BTC specific.

* Deflation: I agree this is an issue. It's my primary concern with Nano, which I believe to otherwise be one of the more promising currency coins due to its speed. There are cryptos that have inflation though, e.g. Stellar. I am not too hot on the pro-deflation economic theorists out there (who are especially popular on crypto subreddits). I don't think inflationary currency is a broken system so why fix something that isn't broken. But a ""time will tell"" issue, possibly.",1523780816

"They already did a blocksize increase with the segwit softfork. So they don't need to hardfork. It's not by my logic. It's by the logic of a hardfork. Once a hardfork occurs there's a new alt coin while the original bitcoin is still there and will always be there. I don't think you grasp that part. They can add as many softforks they want to the original bitcoin. And anyone can hardfork, even you and I can hardfork it if we want to and that's what I'm trying to tell you, a hardfork is just forking it into an alt coin just like the 95% of airdrops from all the worthless hardforks on bitcoin. BCH is the only hardfork that actually gained some kind of traction and that's literally only because of how they were manipulating users with the ""this is the real bitcoin"" crap. BCH is a alt coin. People calling it the original are retarded.  
  
Hardforks are like a way devs can test out how a certain code can work without using it on the original. For example if a dev has a new code he wants to test out, he can simply hardfork bitcoin and use that new code on the alt coin to see how it works. That's what bch basically is, a test dummy to see how bigger blocks work when it's not really neccessary. Bitcoin already added bigger blocks with their softfork.",1523780031

Have *YOU* ever used it? Once a transaction is confirmed, it will stay confirmed for ever, there is no such ""unconfirming"".

&gt; How's the decentralization going?

I see you bringing up the same old argument about the coordinator, which seems to be the most convenient way to fud IOTA. Although I agree that this is not a final solution, the whitepaper by Dr. Popov gives a very detailed description of why there is a need for a coordinator in the early days. The IOTA Foundation has stated that they are already working on decentralizing the coordinator.

IOTA is a completely new technology, that cannot be implemented overnight as opposed to many Bitcoin forks and ERC-20 tokens. However, once the IOTA protocol is production ready (ETA is this year), IOTA will be far superior in terms of decentralization than every blockchain, because due to the lack of miners, IOTA will not just be decentralized, but completely distributed. It's definitely a long-term hold, but if you compare it to Verge, you really should stay away from crypto.",1523779206

What happens when BTC aka Bitcoin Core does a hard fork. It's going to have to in order to upgrade it's block size to allow for LN to truly work, assuming they can fix the routing problem. 

Or should Cobras proposal for a proof of work change, guess what. That's also going to require a hard fork.

It has nothing to do with being ""libertarian"", and keynesian economists are lost in time, no amount of government expenditure is saving dollar from being a fiasco.

Actually, for 99% of the human history, fiat money didn't exist at all. Keynesian economics doesn't work without fiat because the government can't print money to bail out banks or ""warm up"" the economy, which is only another way of saying ""diluting everyone else while preserving the shares of those getting the government newly printed fiat"".

the fact of the matter is, the tax law for crypto didn't change, he should have cashed out enough to at least pay his taxes at the end of the year - he didn't. That's a ""no one's fault but your own"" situation",1523777130

Do the people who invest in these coins actually think the whole world is going to sit up , forget bitcoin and Eth and start using “tron” or “verge” etc.   Get real.    99 % of these projects are fly by night scams.     There are only 3 coins that will stand the test and actually have every day usage.

"That seems to me to be exactly what he said. 

He said the differences between shares and cryptos are:

1. cryptos are new
1. crypto investors are frequently unaware of tax law because they're young and fresh

The conclusion was that normal capital gains tax shouldn't apply to cryptos.

Ignorance of the law is not an excuse for not following the law. Therefore premise 2 can't have lead to the conclusion. 

Therefore premise 1 is what he used to derive the conclusion.

So his argument is:

Cryptos are new, therefore the same tax rules shouldn't apply.

Did I miss something? What else could he possibly be saying?",1523776519
"bch capacity is much higher so it doesn't get ""spammed"" down like BTC.  BTC low capacity means it is extremely easy to ""spam"" the network making it very unreliable/insecure.",1523776434
It is because a person could sell their crypto for a loss and buy it back in the same moment to offset gains. Basically everyone after the crash could sell crypto to themselves for a massive loss and keep the coins at the same time. You can't wash sell stock for a loss. ,1523776429

"Why shouldn't the same tax scheme apply?

&gt; crypto is brand new ... The exact same taxation... is wrong

I'm really not twisting your words or anything. You're saying that since cryptos are new, they shouldn't be treated like other capital gains. As if being new somehow impacts what should and shouldn't be taxed.",1523776297
"Probably yes, but not guaranteed.  Like-kind was ALWAYS supposed to be about real estate and the application to other things (including crypto) was never as firm as people like to think.  Odds are IRS isn't going to go after anyone over it though.",1523776258

"I wouldn't be so polarized in thinking of bitcoin vs ethereum. The smarter investor doesn't care if its potatoes vs tomatoes as long as % gain is better.

Generally, bitcoin leads the market in both up and down, being 42% of the dominance, nothing moves without its approval. Therefore, shedding the emotional ties to either one, it is smarter when the market is turning from bear to bull to turn all assets into BTC and ride the wave up. When Bitcoin starts to plateau, trade it to ethereum and ride that wave. Finally as Eth stagnates trade it into the alt coins for the last bang and cash out to USD.

"Because if I do a trade, and I REALIZE a gain but don't cash out, then the asset drops, welp, I still owe that money.

You forgot to include ""in that tax year"".  Presumably the problem you have is you can lock in losses this year which would erase your gains from last year but the issue is one of timing - it's in this year, so getting a 6 month extension and hoping the markets go up doesn't exactly help you because you could end up triggering more tax to pay if you make more gains.

Everyone trading needs to understand when you go from crypto to crypto at a profit you have to account for tax on that profit (i.e. you should be selling out part of your profits to fiat to pay tax if the market is rising) and put time into understanding your actual position instead of saying ""i'll do cash in cash out"" which won't work. Personally I don't think the IRS will be digging into 2017 trades too much, because there is such widespread misunderstanding... but they could if they wanted to.",1523775927

Yes, there could theoretically be a large disruption that could cripple the bitcoin system. 
But
That would be so hard basically impossible. As long as bitcoin mining remains decentralized it would be hard to destroy everyone’s hardware. In fact, it would just create a massive in-flux of new mining interest because of the bonanza of problems to solve.

"Miners don't have to even mine full blocks if they don't want to, so they don't even need a spam attack to achieve the effect you're referring to.

And, either way, we can see by looking at the total pending transaction fees that the ecosystem proper is running completely on schedule, so we can rest _assured_ that there is no colluding miner attacking the network at this time. And even if there _is_ a spammer trying to, he's learning why spam was never the actual root cause of the problems by the fact that we've cleared out the mempool within a day, and no bitcoin user that isn't also on a forum even knew it was happening!",1523775872
