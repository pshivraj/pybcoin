Biggest battle is being fought at the moment in usability front. Btc can only hodl waiting for holy grail called lightning network that has no chance to work as intended, while bch is gaining all users that actually have plan/vision of using it.

Once people have bought BCH's though, the opportunity is there for them to realise that it is also useful, cheap, fast and easy to use a portion of it as currency instead of just hodling all of it. That is where is, the community can help in their education and awareness by focusing on use and adoption. If we can show them that by actually using 10% or more of their Bitcoin Cashs to buy goods and services, they stimulate more adoption and use for BCH, thereby ensuring that their other 90% of BCH keeps our goes up in value and price.

Keep in mind that what matters to crypto traders isn't necessarily what's good for crypto. Traders love volatility - that's how they make gains (or losses). Exchanges love volatily as well, since volatility brings volume and volume means business and $$$ for the exchange (and Kraken is an exchange).

"&gt; In particular, by the way, anything CT-based will [...] reduce the soundness of the system to the discrete-log problem.

I have some background in quantum computing, and putting the major long-term technical improvements of bitcoin (back) onto hardness of discrete-log is worrying me. OK, quantum computers breaking discrete log may be out a decade or two, but putting new technology on this flawed footing doesn't align with the general risk-averse conservatism I like about bitcoin. Currently, pub-keys are hashed which kills the exponential advantage of quantum computers (or reduces the window of exposure at least) and in any case, ECDSAs can be replaced by existing post-quantum DSAs, if needed. But with all innovations based on more sophisticated properties of EC crypto, how will they be replaced once QCs become a real threat? What's the plan B here? Why doesn't the original research already start at the basics with introducing post-quantum DSAs to bitcoin and then building funky stuff on top of that? If this is not known to be possible, then all this EC magic is just kicking the gas into a dead end road and the mental energy spend should be invested into more wisely elsewhere. If we continue like this, we will have EC magic in 5-10 years usable on bitcoin, then we will enjoy it for 10 years, before we finally hit the wall once a 5-10k qubit quantum computer kills all the new EC features, while we failed for 10 years to find any suitable replacements. Had we only started today with that research.

Fast forward to this summer pump we are heading into, not much has changed. There is still a shortage for exchanges.

I see two main arguments against COSS - DEXs will be better and the Fees are more favorable for bigger spenders (&gt;$4,000). Both of which I do not see as valid points, DEXs can't and will not do FIAT and second, there were A LOT of people jumping into Bitcoin at $16,000 or more, people I know bought .5-1 BTC at those prices because of FOMO.

"&gt;Furthermore, there are other challenges. CT makes transactions larger, slower to verify, and poses a very significant engineering challenge to incorporate into Bitcoin without breaking backward compatibility.

You are right that an ECC break would break Bitcoin's signature algorithm and in general would be very problematic to all cryptocurrencies. Unfortunately you can't really ""remove the signing feature"" as how else are transactions authorized. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will have to move to quantum secure signing operations once/if an ECC break seems imminent/happens. However, there are a few additional issues with confidential transactions: 

1st An ECC break would not be publicly visible. 

2nd If you are able to create silent inflation you can effectively steal from everyone even if their keys are not vulnerable to quantum attacks

3rd If standard peddersen \(perfectly hiding/computationally binding\) commitments are used then a quantum computer can open them to any possible value. Even an honest user can't convince an honest verifier that he committed to some value in a peddersen commitments if quantum computers suddenly exists. So if quantum computers exists there is no way to open the confidential amounts and the whole system breaks down. 

This last point which is the scariest in my opinion can be somewhat mitigated. The idea is something called a switch commitment: [https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/237.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/237.pdf) and we describe in the paper how it can be used with Bulletproofs. ",1524462605

"&gt;  You can run an application on iota for free so nobody has to pay for it!

Are you sure you're not confusing transaction fees with application fees? There is no such thing as free computing power so while iota may be free to send as a currency, running applications(executing smart contracts) on the network will most likely not be. This is also the case with NEO. Free to send, but costs money to run apps. What Vechain has done is simply provided a way for smart contracts to check with multiple parties regarding who is going to pay the fee for executing the smart contract. Current applications force the end user to pay the fee(think crypto kitties). 

So if you moved reddit onto Ethereum as a smart contract, you would be responsible for paying a gas fee to execute the smart contract that uploads your post. Even worse, if there was an ico for a new redditcoin that went along with this blockchain version of reddit then you would need redditcoin AND ethereum to operate the smart contracts since moving ethereum platform coins also requires Ethereum. With Vechain, somebody else will pay on your behalf and you just use the service without thinking about gas prices, contract execution, etc. That's the way it should be. 

To be fair I'm sure Ethereum is working on a way around this since it's an obvious obstacle to adoption and almost feels like low hanging fruit honestly, but the point of this thread is simply that Vechain has already done it. ",1524462377

"&gt;BCH scaling is on-chain scaling, end of story. That's why you split, not for other reasons. And again, maybe you personally have a different idea, but I don't care... you represent the community in this conversation.

BCH is permissionless.

How can someone prevent 2nd layer implementation on BCH?

It is easy to block onchain scaling by limiting block size but how you block 2xlayers?

That the beauty of large block, it allow for all scaling solutions to fairly compete.


&gt;Yes, and you don't seem to understand it. My node won't be working off an invalid UTXO set, because I validated everything. Again, the point was YOU were relying on others to give you the correct UTXO set without validating it, and I Sybil attacked you.

Then what if the sybil attack is done with a **valid** UTXO set?

Say one transactions is missing, your node will accept it, and if the UTXO hash are part of the merkle tree, it take just as much hash power to produce a valid as it is to produce an invalid chain.


If an attacker has enough hash power to produce an alternative chain, the whole bitcoin security break down (that basically a 51% attack).


&gt;All in all, you are not addressing the problem. You are trying to get out of it with mental gymnastics and conversation distractions (SPVs, Sybil attacks on my node, trying to scale off-chain when the mantra is ""on-chain scaling"".). The problem won't go away, we're bound by physical limits.

2nd layer solutions are bound by physical limit too. (If decentralised, they will scale poorly too)

I wasn't implying that the market capital calculations are any different, rather that due to the unregulated nature of crypto and how anyone can just create one at a whim, not to mention the relatively small size of crypto, there are a lot of ""shitcoins"" which are contributing to the total market cap which may have almost never even been traded between anyone but the owners.",1524459617

&gt; Bitcoin was designed by Satoshi with Merkle trees specifically for the type of pruning described in the whitepaper. The way it is described in the whitepaper, you don't need to do an initial chain download, you only need to download the UTXO set and the block headers for a fully functional node.

I always thought the real benefit of using merkle trees was being able to use spv clients. Your claim is rather bold. Where can I read more about it?

Nah, the whitepaper is extremely explicit in saying that a coin is a chain of signatures. There is no easy way of securely bootstraping a new node the way you said. In the dev mailing list there was some recent discussion about a utxo commitment structure, which would make it feasible. The first problem is that the utxo set doesn't store the full transaction, only the outputs. So I can just tell you that I have an outpoint (txid, vout) with given scriptPubKey and amount and you don't have enough data to verify that this utxo in fact is part of the transaction txid present in a past block. I don't need a hash collision for this. I can redistribute ouput amounts between many utxos and you'd not be able to prove it has been tampered. You really need to trace every coin back to a valid coinbase transaction to be sure it is a valid coin.

The 2016 Democratic National Committee email leak is a collection of Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails stolen by Russian intelligence agency hackers and subsequently published (leaked) by DCLeaks in June and July 2016 and by WikiLeaks on July 22, 2016, during the 2016 Democratic National Convention. This collection included 19,252 emails and 8,034 attachments from the DNC, the governing body of the United States' Democratic Party. The leak includes emails from seven key DNC staff members, and date from January 2015 to May 2016. The leaked contents, which suggested the party's leadership had worked to sabotage Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign, prompted the resignation of DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz before the Democratic National Convention.

"Just to play the devil's advocate, and being someone who has lived most of his adult life outside the US and dealt with similar tax situations, it doesn't matter what a Puerto Rican tax attorney says. The only thing that matters is what the IRS says. As far as I know, crypto is already viewed as a commodity by the IRS.

I mean, if what you're saying is true, I could live any number of places outside the US and not pay taxes on crypto. and I'm pretty sure the IRS would dispute that. 

Also, if you're a US citizen and spending more than 30 days/year in the US, you are considered a resident of the US and  are therefore liable for all the taxes you would normally be. In other words, if you're spending more than 30 days/year in the US, you are NOT considered a resident of another country for tax purposes. So Puerto Rico might give you residency with 189 days or whatever, but the US won't let you OUT of residency (and the tax requirements that come with it, or rather the inability to claim exclusion) if you have more than 30 days in the US.

So, in short, I doubt very much that it's as simple as you may think. But I may be wrong! I hope I am! I mean, if we can live outside the US and not pay taxes on crypto, I'm much richer. ",1524457071

"&gt; So it's already implemented and does it automatically?

The current implementation developed by Core is a simple hack, it is nothing like what is mentioned in the whitepaper.

&gt;550 blocks deep? Or is this a manual command you're talking about where there's no existing consensus on how deep the block needs to be?

It's a manual command implemented by Core, it prunes whole blocks beyond a certain age/height.

Bitcoin was designed by Satoshi with Merkle trees specifically for the type of pruning described in the whitepaper. The way it is described in the whitepaper, you don't need to do an initial chain download, you only need to download the UTXO set and the block headers for a fully functional node.

The way it was implemented by Core, you need to download the whole chain to start up a full node, and it will prune whole blocks as you download them.

The big difference with Core's implementation, besides just being a simple hack, is that if you add a private key, you will need to download the whole chain all over again in order to rescan the blockchain.

&gt;...rescans as well as the RPCs importwallet, importaddress, importprivkey are disabled.

&gt;https://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.12.0#wallet-pruning

If you want a better explanation of how Merkle Trees work in Bitcoin, BIP 098 did a pretty good job explaining it.

https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0098.mediawiki

Understand that you would need to find a SHA-256 collision to be able to spoof a bogus transaction into a Merkle Tree. It's estimated that a computer with enough power to find collisions would require more energy than the sun.

I had a big argument with /Designeraccount about it if you want to see what the arguments from that side are:

"We're accepting both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. Here is my thought behind this decision.

In BTC community, using on-chain payments to ""pay for coffee"" is explicitly frowned upon. One of my closest friends is a Bitcoin maximalist. He literally made fun of me when I told him we'd be accepting BTC (along the lines that it would be like ""accepting gold""). It's not a supported use-case, and obviously also not practical given the fees and processing time.

As a merchant, I need Bitcoin to be more like BCH (I am not going into tech or ideological discussions), and I have every incentive to promote it as the ""real"" Bitcoin. That said, in the minds of 90% of people, BTC is Bitcoin. Customers that actually want to pay with crypto are rare enough, and the majority of them want to use BTC. It is confusing for any normal person, including our staff responsible for processing payments, that there's more than one Bitcoin. Simplicity is key. From this perspective, it would be better to only offer BTC for the time being.

Ultimately, we're now accepting both, with BTC being the ""default"" that most people are comfortable with (while encouraging use of BCH or other coins). At the risk of payments going to the wrong wallets.

And yes, if lightning network becomes usable, this would change the situation (by ""usable"" I mean ""I can install an app and it's ready to go, and I don't need to pay fees or lock up funds to use it""). Otherwise, we'll simply move to other coins that are more suitable for payments.

"&gt; International trade is anarchic. Does free trade not occur under this system of no central governing power? Yes or no?

In our current society, international trade is secured by strong militaries, in our case, the US navy.  It's not anarchic either, there are treaties and international law that govern international trade.

&gt;Ancient history is littered with free markets devoid of nation-states entirely.


Please, tell me of ancient history being littered with free markets that were developing and deploying technology.  Sure, barter and trade has existed for a long time but when we talk about ancient cultures in civilization that used technology they are empires like the Egyptians, the Greeks, the Romans, the Sumerians, the Persians, etc.  So be a little more specific with ""ancient history"".

&lt; Bitcoin is currently a free market without central governance. There is no monopoly on Bitcoin creation. There is no issuing authority. Which strong central government controls the Bitcoin market? At most, there exists a federation of individual governments acting upon Bitcoin separately. Hardly a ""strong"" central or federal government.

Those are wonderful attributes of bitcoin, but that doesnt change the fact it wouldnt exist without the underlying technology that enables it being funded by the government.  Those components need to exist for it function.

&gt;You contradict yourself. The moment you acknowledge that another reality is possible is the moment you admit that events could have happened differently. They did not have to happen one particular way. And more importantly, can happen differently in the future.

No, I am not contradicting myself.  We are in this reality, not one of the infinite potential derivations of the multiverse that might or might not exist. Sure, things didnt have to happen the way that they did, but for this reality to even exist they had to occur in exactly the way that they did.

It is YOU that cannot point to any example in the real world of the free market spontaneously existing without a strong government or empire there for it to flourish.  You are the one living in a delusional fantasy that thinks this can happen in the absence of a government.

You are the one that cant answer how property rights are protected and enforced without a government.  You cant point to any concrete examples of this phenomenon existing in reality without making some oblique reference to ""ancient history"".  Tell us more about this mythical place with no government.

However just because Bitcoin is now ready to do 11 million tx a day does not mean it will automatically do 11 million tx a day. Year and years people will have to work hard on adoption, convincing merchants to accept it, spreading the coins around, etc etc etc.

To get back to the peak of Bitcoin-BTC tx of 400 000 a day might take another 5 years. So before we reach 11 million, 10 years or longer might have passed.

It's a temporary cap. Meaning that the blocks will be capped at 32MB but still only be as big as the content within them. Currently the [BCH blocks average](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin%20cash-size.html) is much smaller than the cap.

"Let me preface this post by saying that I don't know exactly what nChain's plans are - if they want to develop their own client with their patented technology, then cool, that's their prerogative. 

That said, I will never ever support a chain that has patented technology in its consensus code. That would be completely contrary to Satoshi's vision, which this community is all about (that's an appeal to authority fallacy though, and not my only point). More importantly, it allows one company complete control of the coin. And unlike with btc, where we have (and took) the option to fork into a coin that suits our values and let the market decide, we would not be legally allowed to do that. If nChain doesn't like what you're doing with the coin, it doesn't happen. I'm sure you can see how that's a big problem. How long until a government infiltrates them? Or legally requires them to perform some censorship? Or they just decide to follow their own interests instead of the interests of the community (which, by the way, is what everyone is supposed to do in an ideal cryptocurrency world)?

I don't believe in the whole blockchain will get too big for hard drives thing because I believe hard drives will scale enormously, but clearly lightning would be more efficient than bigger blocks. Broadcasting to every single node is less efficient than transmitting your payment to one receiver in a channel. I'm sure you're familiar with the tcip comparison. I also spoke to peter todd in person at the latin American blockchain and bitcoin conference about not even using lightning in a few years and using optimal layer one scaling that doesn't involve blocks. I think the paper he referenced was based on this. https://petertodd.org/2017/scalable-single-use-seal-asset-transfer . Why from an engineering standpoint would you be bullish on bcash?

You're just trying to wiggle your way out of something you inherently cannot prove.  A central government is the government of a nation-state and is a characteristic of a unitary state. This is the same thing as a federal government which may have distinct powers at various levels authorized or delegated to it by its member states, though the adjective 'central' is sometimes used to describe it.

I'm so excited about this technology.  They also added decimal places so mSatoshi is possible.  So my fee was like 6000 mSat.  As the lightning network grows the transaction fee on lightning is going to drop.  There's going to be more routes and competition among channels for lowest forwarding fee.  So there's room for bitcoin to grow significantly in price as well as infrastructure while keeping extremely low fees and extremely high transaction throughput.

"&gt;aha! i had one of those but found it extremely concerning b/c of it's centralization and cumbersome platform. i couldn't trust it despite there being 3 locations. no thanks. i'd rather keep my savings on a decentralized blockchain.

Sure, it could potentially be argued that GoldMoney (despite having more than a dozen independent custodial storage locations today) is ""centralized""--but even granting that, the custodial gold storage industry, writ large, is *decentralized*. 

If you don't like GoldMoney (and by extension, Brinks and Loomis) you can exercise some other option.

&gt;they're pulling up new finds all the time, in case you hadn't noticed.

Yes, because the gold price keeps going up relative to energy and labor costs. Imagine how high it would have to go to make *space* mining profitable.

Even still, a ridiculous amount of gold remains on the sea floor today, and I'm not talking shipwrecks.

&gt;unless you're talking about a centralized service like GM, it is NOT easily divisible by the common man. please, let's be real here. there is no question about this. ordinary users cannot go cutting up grains of gold, let alone expect to be able to spend it in their neighborhood stores. you're being very misleading here.

Yes it is. Your grandpa did this all the time using dollar bills, checkbooks and silver coinage. And, as discussed earlier, gold storage and fulfillment, as a competitive category, is effectively *decentralized* through the forces of market competition.

Even if you want further decentralization, it's easy: Save in gold locally and exchange for BCH when needed. Then you get the best of both worlds, right now, without having to wait for Bitcoin to potentially become a store of value in the future. 

&gt;again, this is just not true for the avg gold collector. the cumbersome nature of this makes it impractical for everyday money. which is precisely why it isn't being used today as such.

Clearly you've never weighed or assayed gold.

&gt;you're kidding right? gold has collapsed in relative value compared to Bitcoin and i'm pretty sure there are many more ppl into Bitcoin than gold by sheer numbers alone worldwide.

Rocketing up in price occasionally =/= Storing value.

&gt; GDAX eventually confirmed that there was no indication of wrongdoing or account takeover.

&gt; Instead, the flash crash was the result of someone placing a multi-million-dollar sell order at market price, meaning ETH would change hands at whatever price bidders were currently offering until the entire order was filled ‚Äì no matter how much lower the price was than the current price of ETH.

&gt;&gt; Filling this order caused ETH prices to instantly slip 30% to $224 ‚Äì **which in turn caused 800 stop loss orders and margin liquidations**, which further drove the price down, to as low at $0.10.

Emphasis mine. 

That's stop hunting. GDAX can't prove that there wasn't malicious intent - they can only prove that the account that market sold didn't have orders below the $223 number.

&gt; * infecting computers with mining malware (causing bad coverage in public facing press)

Ok, whoa whoa whoa.

You're seriously mixing up groups of people here, this is a problem with not being specific.

The people who infected computers with mining malware were almost certainly not ""the miners.""  They were blackhat hackers who wanted to make money off of trojans &amp; viruses.  They technically ""became miners"" but your two statements one after the other implied some sort of link between the authors of the software that attempted to steal electricity from millions of people anonymously over the internet and the group of people who secretly built an ASIC.  You said right before that:

&gt; Their actions were as follows

&gt; * the miners were secretly mining on ASICs, stripping coinbases from CPUs and GPUs as was intended (causing grumbles in the community, and massive mining difficulty)

I'm ASSUMING you understand that the two groups of people you're talking about here, while both eventually became ""miners,"" were in no way or shape the same group.  Nor do they share the same ambitions or goals, and in fact that actions of one are antithetical to the other.

Let's back up a moment.  The malware / trojan miner problem is actually an inherent tradeoff in the ASIC versus ASIC-resistant decision a coin makes.  The malware/trojan miner problem long predates the Monero situation.  It actually predates Monero itself.  In early 2013 when ASIC's first hit the scene, it was estimated that malware botnets might make up as much as 10% of the Bitcoin mining network.  I remember seeing someone somewhere estimate nearly 25%, though I doubt I could find the reference after this many years.  It was the asics that finally put an end to that - Until their release, Bitcoin was the easiest and biggest target for the botnets to mine on.  Even though the botnets were mostly on CPU's, they could still compete with GPU's due to their massive scale and ""free"" electricity.  After two generations of asics, it was nearly pointless and they could make 10-100x more money by mining on a different coin, so they did.  As those coins got asics themselves, they switched coins again and again.  They landed on Monero as it is both private/untrackable AND asic resistant - the perfect target for a botnet operator.

This choice had nothing to do with ""The miners"" and everything to do with the Monero communities choice for asic resistance.  Note that I don't begrudge them this choice, I simply [recognize that the asic-resistance choice](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/8a0m2b/lets_discuss_asic_resistance_in_this_week_core/dwvemjh/) has both pros and cons, and botnets are one of the big cons.  Unlike long-investment bound asic miners, or even large scale GPU miners, botnet operators have zero ties to the success or failure of the coin.  They simply want to get their money by stealing electricity from ten thousand people, that's all.

As far as what you specifically said, ""secretly mining on asics"" isn't actually a crime by itself.  The massive mining difficulty increase has a negative effect on other miners, but it has no effect on the non-mining users of the ecosystem.  I'm not saying it isn't bad, it just isn't really an attack on the coin so much as an attack on the other miners.

&gt; * dumping coins on markets as soon as possible (causing constant downward pressure on price). The last point may not necessarily be seen as bad though, i agree.

So this is literally all PoW.  Any proof of work done without rampant inflation will have a saturation point.  As the mining investment reaches the saturation point for that USD exchange rate, nearly all of the coins **must** be sold to cover real world costs.  The only ways to avoid this are essentially switching to PoS.  There's a few complex ways to mitigate it, but they aren't particularly effective nor are the clear and reliable.  Just psychology games versus the miners.

So from your list / example, all that I see that's tied to ""the miners"" and not an inherent part of the coin's own choices is the secret development of asics.   Of course, the development itself wouldn't need to be secret if the community weren't very anti-asic, so that itself is in part a consequence of their choices.  Even disregarding that, it negatively affects other miners much like the second generation of asics in Bitcoin negatively affected the first generation's owners.  I don't see that as an attack on the coin.

&gt; At least you get to the actual point of my question - which you didn't seem to want to answer, so lets step through this slowly.

&gt; &gt; Why would the miners collude?

&gt; Because miner collusion means they can agree on a minimum fee for transaction cost. This increases each and every miners' coinbase, and hence, profitability

Ok, let's jump into this.  **What percentage of miners are colluding in this way?  How large is the average produced blocksize?  What's the maximum blocksize of the network?  What are the colluding miners doing to the non-colluding miners, are they orphaning non-participants?  These are the specifics I'm getting at.**  When we know them we can begin to work out the scenarios.

Lets look at the orphaning versus non-orphaning question.  It obviously makes their attack much stronger if they choose to orphan non-participant miners, but this is a high risk strategy.  The first thing the non-colluding miners are going to do is go to the community / developers and go ""wtf mate, we're getting fucked all of a sudden, what gives?""  If the colluding miners don't admit their intentions right away, and/or if they aren't apparent, it'll be treated as a blacklist/whitelist orphan attack, another very high risk strategy.  That will result in a severe backlash from the community, businesses, exchanges, and developers as it wouldn't be ""fair.""  If the colluding miners simply admit they are orphaning blocks that don't also drive up the minimum fee, that information is going to get out almost immediately and have a similar backlash.  And the developers/community are hardly defenseless here.  They can soft-fork to change the rules against the specific strategy the miners have taken, or they can change PoW, or they can do any number of other things against the cartel's particular strategy.  This reaction is what makes the strategy high risk.

What about a lower risk strategy, a hidden approach of simply trying to drive fees up?  Then it begins to matter a lot about the blocksize avg/maximum differences as well as the percentage of the miners that are colluding.  We can go into that if you want, but it becomes difficult for the miners do significantly drive up fees without detection, and once they are detected we get back into the situation of developers/community/exchanges/businesses versus miners.

Do you see why I'm trying to get specifics?  They matter, they determine a lot about how the ""attack"" might play out or might not.

&gt; It was profitable as the user base faced a situation where the costs of moving to an alternative chain (ie using another coin) were greater than the utility derived from remaining on the chain on which the miners were colluding.

This is not the only choice that users have though.  Power in the Bitcoin world is a confluence of political, developer, business, exchange, merchant, user, and miner choices.  No single entity has control, by design, and if any single entity bucks the rest and tries to seize control, it is going to go very very badly for them.  While miners might decide it is in their best interest to drive up the fees (I doubt this because of other reasons\*), businesses/exchanges/merchants/users are almost certainly going to disagree and attempt to convince developers to change the rules in a way that flips the table on the colluding miners.  And the miners cannot sell their coins to cover costs without businesses/exchanges/users.

\* Miners also prefer bigger blocks currently because their investment is forced to be long term.  The cycle of a mining device reaching ROI takes, generally, almost 2 years now.  Decreases in coin value have the most direct effect on their profits, as it both decreases revenue AND shifts the saturation point.  Miners want the saturation point to be rising, so their best move is to have either a consistently high price or a constantly increasing price during that 2 year cycle.  Taking steps that harm adoption and merchant usability would possibly bite them in the ass before the 2 year cycle is up.  The cycle length for non-asic miners is shorter, and the cycle for botnet operators is essentially just the time it takes to sell the coins and write a software update, so asicminers actually are better in this way.",1524448700

"""It was called gold standard and it was a disaster.""

No. The problem was that it was enforced by the government, right up until they figured out that instead of raising taxes (an unpopular option), they could just debase the currency to pay for their wars. In the case of the U.S., this started with World War I.

No government has ever been able to resist the money-grab for long, so there never really was a gold standard ""disaster."" There were other problems with financial institutions at the time, but they had nothing to do with the gold standard.

Cryptocurrencies are the first form of money other than actual gold or physical valuables that governments cannot debase in this way.

""limit the ability to make these bad transactions.. and their value will disappear""

Except they can't. If they don't know who got what, when they can't tax it and they can't stop it. Governments can and will tax you when you cash out to fiat, but that's it. 


Further, crypto enables transactions that aren't necessarily illegal, but the Payment providers like VISA and pals have decided they won't process. A lot of transactions involving (legal) adult content fall into this category. Crypto makes such transactions possible where they were not possible before.

Credit cards are ~90% of transactions at most merchants, and that comes with 2-4% processing fees.  That is HUGE.

Do you REALLY think the franchisee is opposed to pocketing another $50,000 per location per year?

The problem is **volatility**.  If you can't grasp this concept, consider that **gold** has been around forever and always held value.  Why can't I go buy burgers with gold bullion? Gold might go up 20% by the time the end of the month, or it might go down 20% by the end of the month.  If they operate on 15% margins, they would have been profitable but are now fucked because they essentially gambled by accepting gold.

Now consider that bitcoin can do that by the end of the **day** not month.

No.  Do I pay employees any differently because of that?  No.  Do my beef costs go up? No.  Water? No.  Electricity? No.  Taxes?  No.

They hedge the amount by investing your money margin 3x. so if it goes to 30,000 , they can pay you and the casino wont lose or win. However they will win all the money of losers who selected any other option. They can even win more by the amount BTC increased.

If you bet $100 for BTC to go down, then the casino wont invest your money and will accept the loss, but will pay you much less. Casino wont lose in this case, because they will win by all the losers who bet BTC going up, which will be a lot because they paid more.

The former were essentially built from the ground up after destruction during wars to have Western (i.e., USA-modeled) economic and governmental systems, whereas the others have Russia-modeled facist communist systems.

But the lambo-kids here overwhelmingly just talk about Asian coins like they are all the same.

While their precious NEO sits in the doldrums hardly moving an inch, Asian traders are buying the shit out of EOS sending it to All Time Highs.  Not recovery.  All Time Highs.  EOS is 10xing while NEO goes nowhere.

I said NEO is ill-conceived because it has to be compliant to a fascist communist government that controls everything and is the epitome of centralization -- China has the most centralized government in the entire world.  ICX is completely different except S. Korea is one of the smallest countries and smallest markets in the first world.  Good luck leading crypto through ownership of one of the smallest markets in the world.",1524440758

"No crystal ball, but if you want my guess, in the next day or so we'll correct down to 8400 range for BTC, bounce off of it decisively, and then rocket past it to 10K. What happens after that depends on a few things. One possibility is we smash through 10K as soon as we get to it. I think that would represent full-bore bullish mooning, likely very similar to what we saw at the end of 2017, with the altcoins going nuts and BTC mooning to 20K plus or more.

But here's the alternate, much more bearish scenario - lets say we fail to bounce off the 8400 level and drop back down. In that scenario, we could drop back down to the 6-7K range. Low 6,000 dollar range represents extremely strong support for BTC - that's what TA experts call ""market structure,"" and if we drop decisively below 6K - this whole market will collapse. We're talking 3K BTC or worse, altcoins in a severe depression, could be really, really bad for a good long time after such an event. I think that's unlikely. 

But both the possibility of us failing to bounce off 8400 (unlikely) and the possibility of us dropping below the support line of 6K (extremely unlikely) are there, so we should prepare ourselves for both. 

But lets go with the idea that we'll stay above 8400 (which I think is likely). Let's say we don't break 10K (which is possible). What could happen then? 

I think that might represent another place for BTC to go sideways for the next few months. Bitcoin traders will enjoy that as they'll be able to profit off the up and down movements of BTC (alternately shorting and longing BTC). 

What will that mean for altcoins? Likely continued bullish action, which will be lots and lots of fun. :) :-)",1524440473

"&gt; Now cheapest electricity is from PV (photovoltaics, AKA solar panels). Sure, they can't generate at night, but pumped hydro solves this now and lithium batteries will solve this soon. Also PV can be paired with wind. So no, bitcoin will not cause human extinction.

The cheapest source of electricity is Coal, not solar. Good solar panels are expensive to manufacture and only work when there's day-light.

Hidro-plants cannot be used when some smart-ass wants to, specially during summer and during dry seasons. Most water in dams is used for human consumption and farming.

Wind power plants only work when there's wind in specific conditions and in continued supply. A wind turbine costs energy to be powered up (it sucks energy from the network). To turn them on, the constant wind supply needs to remain for some time, otherwise it will not break-even.

Adoption of a crypto as a outright payment method by the largest porn site on the planet, backed by the largest company in the adult entertainment industry is without a doubt the best possible thing that could be happening right now. It means soon enough the rest of the world will have to awaken to crypto as currency and Verge is now one of the names they'll already know about.

As far as asset classes go. Sure. Bitcoin can stay an asset. Verge can be the currency. The currency is always far more valuable. All the gold in the world is worth around 8-9 trillion dollars. The value of the USD isn't even really measurable since the entire world uses it and values fluctuate constantly. If you want to line it up to the price of gold though, I would definitely say there's way more value than 8-9 trillion in the USD. Quite a bit more actually. So bitcoin can stay an asset class. I'm gonna push XVG as currency instead. Assets are nothing more than speculation for the most part. Currencies are truly valuable based on the value people place in them and their use.

"**Smedley Butler**

Smedley Darlington Butler (July 30, 1881 ‚Äì June 21, 1940) was a United States Marine Corps major general, the highest rank authorized at that time, and at the time of his death the most decorated Marine in U.S. history. During his 34-year career as a Marine, he participated in military actions in the Philippines, China, in Central America and the Caribbean during the Banana Wars, and France in World War I. Butler later became an outspoken critic of U.S. wars and their consequences, as well as exposing the Business Plot, an alleged plan to overthrow the U.S. government.

By the end of his career, Butler had received 16 medals, five for heroism. He is one of 19 men to receive the Medal of Honor twice, one of three to be awarded both the Marine Corps Brevet Medal (along with Wendell Neville and David Porter) and the Medal of Honor, and the only Marine to be awarded the Brevet Medal and two Medals of Honor, all for separate actions.

"&gt;You are now stuck in the past with an obsolete reason for using the symbol.

Nope. The censorship is still happening today. It was a major factor in causing the fork.

&gt; This is not the case today. I have no problem with it existing before the fork when since there was no confusion then. I never denied it existed prior to the fork as its common knowledge and obvious that before the fork- the name was in alignment with its purpose.   

No one cares what you think. You just come here to be annoying and trick newbies

&gt; The -only- legitimate reason for using it today is to steal the brand.

That would be an illegitimate reason to use the sub, not a legitimate one. Also, Bitcoin is a networking protocol not a brand. HTTP is not a brand. 

&gt; No one is stopping bch from switching to an appropriately named sub but you guys will never do it because you use the sub to confuse and convert newbies who don't know any better just like you do with the website.

No we don't hide the truth here. I would tell a newbie why we are btc just like I told you. 

&gt; No one is trying to censor anyone but it's illegitimate to not expect people to find the appropriate information in the correct place.  

There are multiple subs dedicated to tracking censorship. Check out noncensoredbitcoin. Just because you like your horse blinders doesn't mean it's not happening

&gt; It's clear as day. Nobody thinks any different no matter how much you claim otherwise. You can and are free of censorship in any appropriate sub relative to your brand but you want to confuse John Q. Public. Nobody is trying to hide or stifle your message. The equivalent is trying to go to microsofts website and seeing apples homepage. Nobody wants that. But you do. You want to go to /btc and discuss bch. That's the point.  If I was the CEO of the ""company"" bch then I would change this immediately as I believe it's hurts the brand and in obvious ways. I own both coins and I don't follow either particularly closely. I actually prefer a different coin to either one but that's not the point here. It's easy to spot the bs and call it out. Who am I trying to trick and how so? If you notice- I never talk bad about the coin itself. I like both coins. I own both coins. I very much dislike the toxic bch community and the tactics you guys do to try and gain ownership. I personally don't care either way except that I hope I can be holding more of the one that eventually wins. That's the extent of my caring of one or the other. You are maliciously trying to trick people and every day you continue running on this sub then you continue to be complicit in it and that's when I call you out in it. It's bs. You can try to claim I'm shilling for bitcoin or memeing or trolling or whatever but you are wrong. My perspective is my own.  I wish I could get behind the community as I do the coin but it's shady af.  

This feels like a giant novel about how you think Bitcoin is a trademark and you're mad about how people don't buy into that falsehood.

I created a new account recently because I wasnt fond of my previous account name. But I didnt even need to be on reddit to know bitcoin news,1524438426
"What cares what the ""real"" bitcoin is? Just use the chain you like and get on with your life.

It's the longest, most boring and fruitless ""debate"" I've ever seen.",1524438392
"Have you run a business?  Have you tried to accept credit cards online?  Do you know what merchants pay for card-not-present transactions?  Probably not, but if you researched it, and learned a little you would understand that online payments start at 3.5% from the majority of MSP's and 5% from aggregators.  You would also learn that number an go close to 10%.   
  
If you learned a little about bitcoin you would understand that merchants can reduce that digital transaction to 0%.  If you don't think generating 5%-10% more profit is important to a small, mid-sized or large business, well shit.  
   
That is one example.  Another would be the emerging cannabis industry and lack of digital processors to facilitate transactions as cannabis companies are deemed high risk by credit card networks.  Bitcoin is a very good use case in high risk industries.   
   
Would you like to keep going on the merchant side or move to the consumer side, or something different all together, I would love to help clear up your misconceptions and misunderstandings.",1524438380
Or you could just buy bitcoin,1524438322
"Don't know if you all consider it an alt, but Bitcoin Cash for sure is going to continue to rise. With a 32 mb fork coming only more people will use it. 

Memo.cash and purse.io services are being added all the time. I'd say BCH can double what it is now, easy. ",1524438316
If you see a benefit for a business to adopt Bitcoin ask to setup a meeting with the owner over phone or social media - the same way anyone hoping to get a service integrated into a business would. You don't see people advocating a given POS system pushing it through the cashier. It's nonsensical. Cashiers don't keep a tally beside the till of requested payment methods and then float those numbers up to management weekly. The OPs intentions are good but his plan is idiotic.,1524438231

Although I don't have recent figures a few years back 58% of the country lived on less than 3.10 USD a day. There is a middle class who can afford to trade bitcoin but most wouldn't have the spare money to do so.,1524438035

Buy Bitcoin a couple minutes before you jump and hopefully you'll get all your confirmations as you fall. #efficiency ,1524437806
"How is it a valid question to ask ""even if I know they don‚Äôt"" take Bitcoin? It's not being done out of a desire to know the answer, the question exists solely to seek attention when you already know the answer. Instead of sitting the owner down like an adult and explaining the value proposition OP sees in adopting bitcoin for their business, OP would rather take it up with the cashier by asking questions they already know the answer to in the hopes the cashier mentions it is being requested. I.E. for attention. It is unbelievably annoying and I hope no one takes their suggestion.",1524437805

"lol Bitcoin is not dead. It is alive and well. Why am I here? Because I still hodl BCH as a hedge from the fork. Been in this since '13. Just think this sub is not ideal. Of course there is censorship. If someone goes over to BBQ sub and tries to talk about Big Black Queers or something hey they would be censored. Would you yell about that? So some altcoin is trying to usurp the Bitcoin name and you cry about censorship? 

I would so much more pro-BCH is it just was honest about what it was and its advantages. LN could fail and not live up to its hype. Idk? And BCH could be used in the future too. It isn't ""Bitcoin"" however. It's something different and I wish so badly that ppl on this sub and Ver would see that too. Sigh... 

I want all to succeed. Rising tides raise all boats. I'm happy about ETH even though I don't have any stake in it. But I have a stake in BCH and I just hate where this sub is going...well already is honestly. It's worse than /r/politics in terms of hive mind. ",1524437707
"I love that the fight is soon going to pivot to being between LTC and BTC rather than BTC and BCH ....

Hey guys what are the Decentralized cryptos? Just Bitcoin and Litecoin?,1524437649
"I want Bitcoin to be stress tested. Let the FUD, regulation, bans, and all the other things government can throw at it come. Then we'll genuinely see which cryptocurrencies are truly decentralized and censorship-resistant.",1524437633

"I didnt blame anyone but myself when I lost my bank card, but it was comforting to know I could get a new one in 3 days and be reimbursed if somebody used it fraudulently.

I'm not on social media for those very reasons so i'm sorry you wasted your time writing pointless drivel. 

Its not irrelevant if you claim to have hot wallets for daily purchases. Not even the dark web is that into bitcoin these days so I hear.

I just find banks convenient and being able to spend my currency of choice everywhere very useful.",1524437606

If you want to talk to a business owner about the potential for adopting bitcoin in their business make an appointment, you don't press the issue every time you are at the register even when you know the answer is no just to get attention.",1524437401
"As a poor person who has put together enough money to enter the crypto scene, I am looking forwards to the, hopefully, when I don't need a bank to do any banking. I am getting charged to have a bank account. I don't think that's fair. I don't even have any money in that account.",1524437385
"Consider the opposite though, the idea that overall rejection is happening or going to happen.

The people who have already ""adopted"" crypto, probably aren't going anywhere. Are they nerdy? Maybe some. Did they get into it because of speculation? Maybe some. But from a broad, outside perspective, I can see the number of new users growing more over time than people leaving the market for good. Whether that's measured in new coinbase accounts vs. ones that go to $0 or something else, I just don't see anything that will suggest adoption is *decreasing*. Which, given the supply of crypto like bitcoin anyway, implies the increasing demand over time will just continue to drive the price(s) up.",1524437380
Negative.  Although they do have GBTC which is a bitcoin trust..lol..,1524437261
"Asking everywhere you spend fiat to take bitcoin even if you know they won't is evangelizing in the worst way. It's unsolicited, it's selfish (you're doing it despite knowing in some instance the answer is no, so the only thing you're accomplishing is stroking your own ego). Call it being a door to door missionary, call it being a telemarketer - doesn't matter. The employees at these businesses are just trying to do their job and 9/10 interactions you have with fiat will not be made with the business owner directly. Anyone who does what the OP is suggesting is wasting everyones time and making bitcoin supporters everywhere seem more annoying.",1524437229
"It makes no difference because a true hodler doesn't care about the price. I meant hodler as someone who believes in the technology regardless of the price--not a trader interested in converting it back to fiat. 

For those people, it really makes no difference to buy now. They are always buying small amounts to increase their btc holdings--regardless of the price. They were buying at $19k and at $6k. They will hold even if it drops to $100 or $10 or $1. There really are such people. :)",1524437184

"Cash doesn't grow 2000% a year. In fact from the moment you receive it inflation starts eroding its value. FIAT currencies have a 100% failure rate. They all fail eventually. So is FIAT safer than Bitcoin? Absolutely not. 

The best approach is obviously to have both. ",1524437135
"I know what both of those things are, you just can't wrap your head around how brand trust works. Why have I had people with hardly any crypto knowledge ask why there's ""2 versions of bitcoin"" in the top 10 by marketcap? Do you not find it embarrassing that bitcoin cash just looks like a knockoff to any crypto outsider? Probably not because you live in a wee bubble.",1524437133

The unique proposition is a product you can give to anyone, and they could learn and understand what Bitcoin is, what other Cryptocurrency is, and how it can be used safely, and securely. Sure there are many videos on YouTube, but there are no products that gives a clueless person a crash lesson in Cryptocurrency, aside from over priced lessons from well know self procialmed ""Crypto-Experts"" on YouTube which may as well be leveled as Scam-lessons.

In theory, without the product and up until the product is available and tangible it's a scam. But I do know a handful of people who have access already to to product and have used and are testing it and they have proved it is not a scam.

"&gt; what happens if bitcoin scales to visa transactions?

Then it will run at Visa transaction levels.

&gt;Last time i remember reading it would require insane big block sizes

Define ""insane big block sizes"". 

Visa level is 2,000 transactions per second, this could be done with 300 MB blocks.

Even Satoshi said Bitcoin could do ""much larger than"" Visa levels of transaction amounts in 2009, with the hardware available at the time, 9 whole years ago. Here's Satoshi's thoughts on scaling (emphasis mine):

&gt;Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe 
for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for 
double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or 
about 12KB per day. Only people trying to create new coins would need to run 
network nodes. At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the 
network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to 
specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would 
only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with 
that one node.

&gt;The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think. A typical transaction 
would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact). Each transaction has to be 
broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction. Visa processed 37 billion 
transactions in FY2008, or an average of **100 million transactions per day**. 
That many transactions **would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 
2 HD quality movies,** or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.

&gt;**If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, 
sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.** 

&gt;[Satoshi Nakamoto](http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/2/#selection-67.0-107.16)

[Today we have 4K movies, with 8K (2020 Olympics will be broadcast in 8K in Japan. Already testing in many places.) and 16K (???) in the pipeline. Each jump requires 4 times as much bandwidth, assuming the same frame rates. So, continuing his analogy, 200 Million transactions would equal one 4K movie, 800 Million would equal one 8K movie, and 3.2 Billion would equal one 16K movie.]

Also:

&gt;The existing Visa credit card network processes about **15 million Internet purchases per day worldwide.  Bitcoin can already scale much larger than that with existing hardware for a fraction of the cost.  It never really hits a scale ceiling.**  If you're interested, I can go over the ways it would cope with extreme size.

http://plan99.net/~mike/satoshi-emails/thread1.html

&gt;&gt;The final number I'm interested in is the 500kb limit on block sizes.
According to Wikipedia, Visa alone processed 62 billion transactions
in 2009. Dividing through we get an average of 2000 transactions per
second, so peak rate is probably around double that at 4000
transactions/sec. With a ten minute block target, at peak a block
might need to contain 2.4 million transactions, which just won't fit
into 500kb. Is this 500kb a temporary limitation that will be slowly
removed over time from the official client or something more
fundamental?

&gt;**A higher limit can be phased in once we have actual use closer to the limit and make sure it's working OK.**

&gt;Eventually **when we have client-only implementations, the block chain size won't matter much.**  Until then, while all users still have to download the entire block chain to start, it's nice if we can keep it down to a reasonable size.

&gt;**With very high transaction volume, network nodes would consolidate and there would be more pooled mining and GPU farms, and users would run client-only.**  With dev work on optimising and parallelising, it can keep scaling up.

&gt;**Whatever the current capacity of the software is, it automatically grows at the rate of Moore's Law, about 60% per year.**

Also, the amounts we're talking here are embarrassingly small. Because no one is using their network, *(Bitcoin is an order of magnitude over their activity, even hourly)*, they will barely send even one BCH to that address even after a few weeks.

"Hi /r/bitcoin, last week I launched Cointabb and I'm looking for some feedback. The big difference between CMC and Cointabb is that the latter is simpler and cleaner and has some cool features that I feel CMC lacks. Here is a small list of some of the improvements:

* Pages are fast, clean, and easy to read/scan on any device
* The favorite/bookmark feature lets you track coins without requiring login or sign up
* The trending page shows you coins/tokens that are doing well over the last 24 hours
* The filtering feature lets you set custom parameters to find promising coins/tokens etc...
* Platform pages let you view/search/filter tokens on platforms
* The site offers a consistent and clean night mode version for all devices

And a few more things you'll find as you explore the site. Each page also links to CoinMarketCap page so you can be able to use both sites at the same time. Please let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions for improvement.

"Copied and pasted from the Asch subreddit with minor edits:




I present to you Asch (XAS):




XAS also known as ASCH is a chance for a potential moon mission similar in size to ETP, ANT, WTC and OMG.




Unlike most of the Chinese coins in the above list, XAS was actually an insanely hyped and popular project in CHINA that received a lot of support from it‚Äôs community. However due to unfortunate timing its momentum was killed of by the sudden China FUD. I bet most of you are not familiar, but during that time XAS was also branded as the Chinese LISK, and was acknowledged by most to have even superior underlying technology.




Asch (XAS) has already been in development for a while (3 years). XAS had the largest trade volume at jubi.com before the Chinese government ban on ICO, even higher than Neo and WTC combined!




Asch (XAS) is an ethereum like platform that adopts an enhanced DPOS consensus mechanism created to reduce the skill threshold required from developers in creating Dapps. They bridge this gap by adopting JavaScript as an application development language and by supporting RDP (Relational Database) to store the transaction data. More importantly, Asch‚Äôs unique sidechain-as-a-application (SaaA) mode alleviates the blockchain inflation issue, as well as makes dApp much more adjustable and individualized. Asch is a prospective, low-cost, one-stop solution that will become the incubator of next generation decentralized application.




These are the distinctive features of ASCH compared to LISK:




Supporting side-chains (cross-chains). 2.DApp data are stored in the side-chain, so the main chain data will not swell too fast.




The Advantages of Node.JS language.





Saving block data in relational database to reduce the difficulty of dApp development




The speed of block production is rapid. Producing one block per 10 seconds and confirming it fast.




There will be no forking issues.




Safe sandbox isolating mechanism





Asch founder, Qingfeng Zhang, is a well respected figure in the block chain industry. He has worked as a development engineer in Kodak,YunYun and Weibo during his early years. In 2012 he was drawn to bitcoin, in 2013 he built a Ripple gateway and in 2016 he started working full-time to develop ASCH. Qingfeng Zhang is only the tip of the iceberg, they have 7 other core developers of similar reputation.






Asch‚Äôs github¬†https://github.com/AschPlatform/aschhas also been very active and I can see them starting to form a lot of partnerships soon, and make a new push towards rebranding to the western market.




https://www.asch.so





Asch already has several Dapps launched on their platform by developers, unlike some other projects who are only based on hype, some of them are:





CCT- A distributed and decentralized social news sharing and communication platform.





Killing chain- World‚Äôs first multiplayer online battle royal game based on crypto currency made by developers of Bilzzard entertainment and Ubisoft.¬†https://killingchain.com




KM wisdom- A decentralized predictive market application running on blockchain Many more Dapps are in progress, but still not completed, the above are already done and running.



In addition to Dapps on their platform, Asch is also already done with their mobile wallet+ web wallet and are in the final phases of completing their desktop pc wallet.

ETH might even overtake BTC.

There are two different kinds of DApps. First one is with on-chain app storage (ETH, NEO etc.). Which are meant for entirely new projects, like virtually all ICO/TGEs.

Others are off-chain storage like NEM and Valence (dapp platform of NavCoin). These are meant to let existing business models and apps integrate blockchain in their business/software. I think these kind of platforms will be very interesting in the long-term",1524430744
"Fair. I‚Äôll admit I had a bit of a knee-jerk response to a comment painting what bitcoin is now primarily in terms of what Satoshi said its goals were. I don‚Äôt deny that was the hope and that it has had (mixed, albeit mainly due to governments overreacting, all the things that have gone on with fees, and other ease of use factors) success in bringing that.

I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything wrong with selling some for a profit. While it might be secondary it has brought more interest to it. Personally I don‚Äôt really care why people are drawn in if it keeps building a larger user base and use cases. Heck, the broader crypto space is now starting to have effects on the semiconductor and GPU industries to the point that they‚Äôre citing them in their earnings calls and designing related products. The more this happens, the more it‚Äôs a given, the more it is a normal, accepted thing, the better.  Instead of the press taking about dark web using it for drugs primarily, it‚Äôs just another part of the financial ecosystem that isn‚Äôt going anywhere.

Additionally, I sold a bunch of eth last year for an Africa Twin, don‚Äôt regret it one bit :-). At the time, selling gave me some freedom since everything was fluctuating so wildly. Frankly, though I‚Äôd love to have more profits from some crypto, I‚Äôd also like to see it get to be boring so it can be used more as a value transfer system and people can be less worried about how much their assets have fluctuated in value overnight.

"No. No it's not. 

If anything Coinbase is one of the best ways to cement the terms ""fraud"" and ""Ponzi scheme"" into this wonderful technology.

Very unfortunately. somebody online recommended Coinbase to me as a way to get into Bitcoin! It's very possible that the person who recommended it did not know that Coinbase is not able to sell in Canada, so I can only use Coinbase to purchase Bitcoins but not actually use them! But Coinbase would have known that and should have informed me before I installed their software! They were astute enough to let me know immediately... Immediately! ...After I committed money to them!

The $200 I put in that immediately diminished to under $180 because of ""fees"" was not particularly amusing, but, I thought, I guess they have to make some money in the process. Seemed quite high to me, though...

Well I guess that was okay because my goal was not to actually purchase anything using Bitcoin. I was going to make this a small part of Christmas gifts and create paper wallets for family members! Conversation pieces... 

So I attempted to send $20 to a paper wallet for my 81 year old mother. Bitcoin was in the news so I thought it would be an amusing gift... and I also thought it would never be something she would actually use, hence the$20!

The fee would be over $50! (I was notified that it would be free if I sent to somebody on Coinbase! How generous of them! If I get more people wrapped up into their scheme then I can send the money for free! That smells pretty Ponzi scheme to me!)

Now sending money is something that I can do through an e-transfer for free! Coinbase wanted to charge me over $50 for essentially that same action! 

Coinbase, and anybody else that deals in this sort of gouging is what will kill this technology! This is actually what banks used to do 20 years ago! Except I don't think their fees were ever that high! We need to be better than Banks!

I actually do believe it's wonderful technology and has the potential to do amazing things! It's not an investment tool though! Unfortunately that is the way many people are looking at it! 

If it's ever meant to be currency it has to be spendable and it has to be spent! 

As for the money I put in coinbase, I've left it there and watched it dwindle. A reminder of how right everybody was that said don't put more money into Bitcoin than you can afford to lose! 

That's at least one piece of Bitcoin advice I'm glad I listened to!",1524429662

"One trend I really like from that chart:
 * Oct low: ~0.6
 * Dec low: ~0.7
 * Apr low: ~0.9

We seem to have a strongly tested lower bound for the price of BCH in relation to BTC.

In other words: BCH is here to stay. Now let's see how the technology plays out over the coming months as BTC remains restricted in capacity, and BCH grows significantly in capacity and fosters a community that actually plans to use that capacity via merchant adoption and cool apps like Memo.cash.",1524428688

",1524428503
"Here's a big rule that I've learned in crypto. Don't buy things that are promises of something in the future. Buy currencies that you can actually use or do stuff with.

I can buy a lot of shit with BTC, Eth, XMR, even LTC. I like BNB a lot because I believe binance is slated to be the biggest crypto exchange in the short and long term. I use their coin.

And I do invest in some companies that are offering products to industries, where I don't personally use the product but I recognize it's there.

I think all of the cryptos that are more 'investments for a future product' are incredibly sketchy.

Tron, Eos, XVG was even one of those... There are others that I think are more legitimate but also haven't delivered 'products' yet. That I think people should be skeptical of.

If you want a way to 100% avoid that risk, buy cryptos where it feels directly useful to you when you buy it. Find ways to use it in your day to day life. That's going to also help you determine which ones actually have use cases.

A lot of people on this subreddit will link shit talking about something being a 'common use case' try using a crypto the way you're describing it can be used. If it's easy and helpful then use it, and maybe invest in more.",1524428482

"&gt;just because something is ""used by you"" does not mean that it is usable in general, or in anyway correct.

That's true. It is the fact that anyone can use it the same way I do and get the same results I do that means that it is usable in general and that the assertions are correct. 

You can easily verify this for yoursef if you'd like to. The first thing to do is determine the conditions by which this view could be falsified or confirmed. Then, we can gather evidence together. You might, like I did, come to realize that much to your own surprise, gold still functions as well as it ever did as money, even if most people don't use it that way.

That's why I say that gold is the best form of money as of yet *discovered* by man. Not ""invented"" by man.

&gt;i agree with your passion for gold. 

Ironically, I'm not actually that passionate about gold at all. I just have come to understand it.

I mean, sure, it's pretty. But chicks dig it much more than I do. 

I'm much more passionate about cash flowing-businesses, economic principles, sound money, good conversations, art, family and a whole bunch of other things. I don't have a ""passion"" for gold in any sense. I have just come to understand its irrefutable role in the world of economic calculation.

&gt;like i said, i invested in th metals very early on, made a great profit when i sold in exchange for Bitcoin, 

Congrats! I hope that you also sold Bitcoin when it was up, to cash out some of your winnings there, just as I did.

There are times to buy gold and times to sell it, just like with anything else. Recently, I have been cashing out some of my gold winnings into commodities that are even more undervalued than gold.

I also cashed out a lot of my Bitcoin gains (over 2500%) into gold, undervalued commodities and fairly priced foreign stocks and local real estate when the price was between $10k and $20k and it became clear that BTC was broken.

Anyway, I don't consider gold an ""investment"". It's not. It has no yield. It's money. BCH, BTW, is a ""speculation"". A very smart one I think. But it's not an ""investment"" either.

&gt;you must know how impractical it is to transport gold or silver. 

Not really. My GoldMoney account allows me to send it freely and instantly anywhere in the world. Back in the day, your grandfather did the same thing with a newfangled technology called ""dollar bills"" and ""checkbooks"". Today, it's even easier and more efficient.

&gt;that's why we continue to find ships at the bottom of the ocean with treasure chests full of it. 

Yes! And often, it's unprofitable to try and retrieve it, and they're right here on earth ;)

Interestingly, this also proves that gold retains its value over hundreds of years, even when the power goes out, and even when it is flooded and sunken, and even when the average person thinks is ""barbaric"" and silly to buy.

&gt;all those properties you listed above really don't apply today

Yeah they do. For instance:

&gt;it's not divisible for the avg person, 

Yes it is, it's easily divisible down to less than a thousandth of a gram. This is made even easier by services like GoldMoney, or old school tech like dollar bills, checkbooks, and derivative coinage.

&gt;it's really not fungible as tungsten filled bars and coin clipping amply demonstrate, 

Yes it is. It's extremely easy to weigh gold for clipping and do assays on large bars. It's cheap to the point of being negligible. And if you are using custodians or escrow for large purchases, it is entirely unnecessary at point of sale.

&gt;it certainly is not a unit of account, 

Only if you don't use it that way!

&gt;and barely anyone uses it as a MOE except maybe you. 

...And also many other people who are very good investors and long range planners. But if everyone knew what they were doing, everyone would be a better investor. 

Mathematically speaking, not everyone can be in the 1%. But if everyone performed better economic calculation than they do now, they could all be a lot wealthier than they are today.

&gt;you can't send it to japan in an instant for services, you can't chop it up into satoshi size bites and get value for it, 

Yes I can. This was addressed above.

&gt;and you can't verify the supply of it on a public ledger.

Many new projects are working on just that.

&gt;i really don't get why you would be so enamored with it now that Bitcoin has arrived and functioned reasonably well for 9yrs. gold bugs can only deny this for so long and you know what? a great many of them have already capitulated to Bitcoin. 

A great many people recently capitulated out of precious metals and into US stocks because Trump makes them feel warm and fuzzy. Most of these people bought gold when it was high. Word to the wise: Wherever and whenever you see mass capitulation, RUN. (Preferably, in the exact opposite direction.)

&gt;i was one of the very first and have witnessed firsthand this transitions since 2011 when i even predicted this would happen. this discussion i'm having with you today took place many times over way back then. thanks for the walk back in time.

Ok, that's nice. Here we are 9 years later and, objectively speaking, gold is still a better store of value and unit of account than Bitcoin is. What do make of that?",1524428240

"This isnt the thread for this, and No, he's not. But, let's for a minute assume that he is. I'm no Russian tool, and I'm certainly not a fan of the Russian Propaganda bullcrap either and silencing of independent investigative journalists. But, how is it then that him simply criticising and exposing the hypocrisy and foul play in the US system falls into the genre of ""Russian Propaganda Machine"", despite him also leaking documents on Russia aswell? 

Don't you think it's funny that then, the US has degraded it's society so far, that Others like Assange speaking the truth is in itself harmful to US interests? You mentioned Snowden. Well acoording to the Constitution, the US shouldn't even be doing the things Snowden revealed. So despite him breaking rules and ending up in Russia (because lets face it, who else is going to accept him where he can't be used as a bargaining chip), if the US was only fulfilling it's Constitutional Obligations and actually upholding Peace, Liberty and Justice, would the ""Russian Tools"" not have such an easy time simply picking harsh truths that the US preaches far too much more than it a really follows it's own guidlines? And there's plenty of declassified stuff, also including the tracking of those using Bitcoin for example, that prove its abuse and constant disregard for the constitution, that all the trolls have to do is speak the truth and it fools every day Americans into actually believing thay wrong is right only because the enemy is telling the truth. The Truth becomes bad, and the US is no longer capable of criticising itself, and as a result, can never improve, only falling down an infinite rabbit hole of self degradation?

"Let's start over, because there are several conversations here in parallel.

You can't remove the signing ""feature"" without crippling Bitcoin - spending coins is signing.

Key reuse is a concern, but it's an existing one that is based on social conventions. I expect it to be fixed, but it will take time.

An ECC break right now would hurt Bitcoin. It's worsened by key reuse, but that's not all. It for example also affects applications that rely on multisig (as they reveal public keys to eachother). The point I want to make is that we shouldn't feel safe just because our public keys are temporarily hashed.

However, it is likely that if an ECC break happens, we will see it coming years ahead. There will likely be incremental improvements to attack algorithms or technology that reduce the security bound. As long as we only rely on ECC for authorizing spends, we can migrate away from it over time.

With ECC based CT, we inherently must accept at least one extra risk:

* An ECC break means the currency can undetectably be inflated (going forward).
* An ECC break means the ledger's history can retroactively be deanonymized (goin backward).

Both of these are unfortunate, but which is worse depends on how we expect ECC to be broken, in my view. If we expect an ECC break to happen with ample warning, it's perhaps better to accept the inflation risk, because we can again migrate away from it, and at least the historical privacy can be protected. If we expect an ECC break to happen unexpectedly, silent inflation is very scary as it's an existential threat to the currency.

Personally, I think both of these viewpoints are relevant. Unfortunately we can't protect against both (except with slower, larger, more novel non-ECC based methods). Perhaps the solution is to provide both options, but it does become harder to get ecosystem buy-in for, I'm afraid.",1524426582

I feel the same way. That's why I push my opinion on people, accept downvotes from sockpuppets and shills, and just say what I really think, and that's also that VEN and REQ and shilled *for sure*. EOS could be legit, but I still find it suspicious. 

&gt; The very fact you are calling it a 'shitcoin'


Why is that? Cardano for all I know is a shitcoin aswell, because it's not even remotely close to where it plans to be. It's shitcoin-build time status. It's not a real thing yet that works. I don't know. No hard feelings attached to the word, it's just how far we are. EOS is not launched, that alone makes me call it Shitcoin and it has no other reason. 

&gt; System is very similar to STEEM which along with BTS


With all due respect, but you cannot argue Cardano vs EOS, and mention past credentials. Of course Dan is not an idiot, but Cardano is full of people that already were successful in the sphere. The founder is straight Cofounder from Ethereum. A project I need to tell you nothing about- because you know it, because it was that groundbreaking at the time. 


Also STEEM was not only ditched by Daniel, but is pretty much known to be a scam to anyone that looked at how it all works specifically. I can link you to various sites explaining you why they're a scam. Not saying anything bad about BTS, solid project. 


&gt; You sound very bitter towards EOS which seems to be based of being over taken in market cap.


Oh, you mean EOS is over Cardano, that's why I'm bitter? Dude I literally hold both of the coins. Any idiot can make money on hype and that's what I do. EOS makes insane returns and give green highs almsot everyday. That's cool and all, that doesn't mean their project will work. All I say is that I'm careful of mainnet launch. That's it. 



&gt; Decentralisation arguments are complex, is btc or ETH controlled by Chinese miners decentralised?


They're complex to people that do not understand the underlying issue. To others, it's not. To those that actually took the time and actually looked at things a little closer than first look. 


Bitcoin is decentralized. They're not controlled by Bitmain, that's Bitcoin Cash you are talking about. Pools are required for people to lower variance. Segwit was pushed, despite miners wanting not to implement it and thus forked Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin is decentralized and will be the most decentralized for at least another year for sure. 


EOS has 21 superpowers. That's not decentralization at all. That's 21 entities you need to shut down, to kill the network. 


&gt; I like ada but they have achieved no more than eos and have almost the same market cap.


They launched Oroboros so there's that. That's a POS network in action. However it is true that vast amount of features are missing within Cardano. The core, which is Oroborus, stands and works. Not some testnet, not some ERC20 token, it's a real thing. 


&gt; However you won't get numerous airdrops, voting, or alternative chains.


How do you know that? I said I sell before mainnet launch, out of fear of immediate failure. If it works for a year and has a proven record and has not developed into some centralized pile of shit, which is what people expect to happen, then I can still join. My opinion on the thing might change.

"The benefit and point is it prevents fraud and charge backs that hurt the provider. A problem now with the game I play is someone will buy an item from the game shop with a stolen credit card and sell it to another player. There is eventually a charge back which causes a headache for the developer and it forces them to delete the item from the player who thought it was obtained legitimately. If you put the data on a blockchain you can verify it's authenticity and be assured a game master won't take it from you. Another reason why is to give players recourse should a game go down forever. If the game provider goes down you emulate the server and point it at your ""assests"". So in this way it provides some nostalgic value at least. Say for example there was a way to bring my World of Warcraft character back exactly as it was in 2004 on my own private server. I would pay for that. I could try to recreate the data manually, but the blockchain would give me the psychological feeling that it was exactly right. Or maybe a community comes together and emulates a game server using the blockchain database everyone can verify who owned what or did what. When most MMORPGs go down the provider does not give the database to the players. If the database is in a blockchain it is sort of like an assurance to players that their time isn't ""wasted"". It's hard to explain unless you play MMORPGs, but blockchains would complement this particular genre of video game in many ways. I can explain more indepth using recent happenings on private servers of well known games how a blockchain could have made everything more transparent, but it will be a large text wall.

Couple of points; 

System is very similar to STEEM which along with BTS, larmiers last two projects, are both in the top 3 used blockchains ever. It launches in 6 weeks, has the most github commits, testnet not much different from final os software I could go on. The system doesn't exist argument will be gone soon.

As for hype I have honestly never seen any in here. Literally never seen EOS shilling here, feel free to link me up. Only because of last weeks airdrop has interest increased.

Decentralisation arguments are complex, is btc or ETH controlled by Chinese miners decentralised? 

I like ada but they have achieved no more than eos and have almost the same market cap.

"&gt; How did he go from ‚Äúbitcoin jesus‚Äù to this?

He didn't, kind of. BCHBTC is pretty much political. 

He forked and made the main network weaker. Forks don't appear out of thin air, they get their value from the coin they forked from, unless other people actively enter the newly created coin with newly created money. 


You know about consensus within Bitcoin, right? Essentially Segwit was pushed and some people got rustled, but were the minority. So they said fuck consensus, we're doing our own thing now. 


So because not everyone dumps this shit immediately, it holds a value. If it holds a certain value, it incentives miners to participate in the network. 



So people said fuck consensus, we're forking and we take part of your miner/money from you. Money I don't have an issue with, neither miners to be honest. That's both just economics. 


Where shit gets vile is the political hatred, also found in Ver, probably much stronger found within Ver. He owned/owns Bitcoin Twitter and use/d it to for BCH. He also a famous Bitcoin page and uses it to promote BCH. You know the subreddit of rBTC? Guess whose sub that is. I don't see Bitcoin Diamond or Bitcoin Gold hijacking all these things from Bitcoin. He uses these things, to trick new people into buying his coin. That's shady as fuck. 



Then you have a guy called Craight Wrait, who claims to be Satoshi, but has been proven that he's not. He's big buddies with him and uses him to further market his coin - as in even the original creator is part of his fork. 



Then you have BCH related topics. Just look at this thread. It's a total disaster. Everyone is angry over at BCH all the time. They're vile and they're angry. If there's good news for BCH, it's not about how this is good for BCH adoption, it's much more about how this will fuck up Bitcoin. Check it out right now. rBTC, check the main frontthreads and check the comments. You will not see good things about BTC, but if anything advertisement for BCH. You want to tell me, that's not shady as fuck? 


It does give them impression that the coin by itself has no merrit. That it only exists to fight people in Bitcoin. 


There's really two different mindsets. 


1) Bitcoin is concered with raising Blocksize. That Blocksize results in a bigger Blockchain. If Blockchain eventually is too big, only a few will be able to run a full node/aka participate in the network. 

https://www.statista.com/statistics/751847/worldwide-seagate-western-digital-average-hard-drive-capacity/


Bitcoin argues, that harddrive space growth, will heavily outgrow harddrive space increases. As can be seen in the link. So they forced a 1 MB solution, with a technique called Segwit, that compromises data, sort of like WinRAR does for your files. Sadly Segwit means lower fees for miners, so big mining companies started to join BCHs side. They want more fees, so they're with them. I value decentralization and I don't want anyone fucking with that, so I decided to support Segwit/Bitcoin instead. Segwit is also a requirement for Lightning scaling. So with Segwit we keep decentralization, because we limit blocksize to 1MB and we rely on off-chain scaling the future, like Lightning. We're also more open to different off-chain solutions in general, who knows what will be added. 



Essentially that's it. I tried to not be too biased. 




Let me say this. If BCH people are right and harddrive space increases as fast as the Blockchain does, then their solution to the scaling problem is correct. 

https://www.statista.com/statistics/751847/worldwide-seagate-western-digital-average-hard-drive-capacity/


That goes back to this. Personally trust data and have experienced it first hand. Harddrive the last 5 years has hardly increased. It will absolutely never be able to keep up with Blockchain growth, even considering the fact that we intend to scale globally - and assuming we're small right now, the Blockchain is *already* 150GB. 


Everybody says we're in infant stage, yet Bitocins blockchain is already 150GB large. How big do you think it will be in 2-3 years, with an ever increasing adoption? And that 150GB is WITH Segwit and 1MB limit to blocks. 



You see how that affects decentralization? Who can realistically store the Blockchain if it's 200TB in 5 years? ",1524423128

Today with BCH, the innovation, hackathons, projects, the upgrade in May - these are real.  So I think a new floor will be settled.

BCH adoption is going great, but I still can't buy a pizza in my town with BCH as far as I know - so if BCH hits $4,000 - I am thinking its a bubble.

However, I wont be surprised if a new floor of $1,500 is found for BCH (since I think people tend to like round numbers).

Long term - BCH is Bitcoin, BTC has no future.

However, I do hold BTC only because in a world where Trump can be President, ANYTHING is possible.  So if BTC were to win out - I am hedging my bets.

"Abstract: Bitcoin, the arguably most popular cryptocurrency 
to date, allows users to perform transactions using freely
chosen pseudonymous addresses. Previous research, however,
suggests that these pseudonyms can easily be linked, implying
a lower level of privacy than originally expected. To obfuscate
the links between pseudonyms, different mixing methods have
been proposed. One of the first approaches is the CoinJoin
concept, where multiple users merge their transactions into
one larger transaction. In theory, CoinJoin can be used to
mix and transact bitcoins simultaneously, in one step. Yet,
it is expected that differing bitcoin amounts would allow an
attacker to derive the original single transactions. Solutions
based on CoinJoin therefore prescribe the use of fixed bitcoin
amounts and cannot be used to perform arbitrary transactions.


In this paper, we define a model for CoinJoin transactions
and metrics that allow conclusions about the provided
anonymity. We generate and analyze CoinJoin transactions and
show that with differing, representative amounts they generally
do not provide any significant anonymity gains. As a solution
to this problem, we present an output splitting approach that
introduces sufficient ambiguity to effectively prevent linking
in CoinJoin transactions. Furthermore, we discuss how this
approach could be used in Bitcoin today",1524422280

This argument is so biased towards Segwit being a wrong implementation. 


You do realize that you lose decentralization alltogether, if you must have harddrive that requires 1000 TB for a Blockchain? 



BCH people argue that harddrive space just scales infinitely, which is does not. Have you seen fxcards get significantly better the last 5 years? CPUs? 



They get better, but no longer as significantly as say 2000-2008. There's only so much smaller they can do. There's a physical limit in aligning the the stuff. 




BCH just banks on the fact that in 5 years we will have these massive harddrives. Harddrives get better for sure! But they will not be able to keep up with the massive blockchain growth that is upon us. 



Who do you think will grow faster? The blockchain without a limit to Blocksizes? Or the harddrive space? 



You also need to understand that this shit better needs to safe, because if harddrive space doesn't scale as fast as BCH blockchain does, then it's game over for decentralization *forever*. 


That's the issue. That's why Core said fuck you miners, we cannot fucking have this. They did us all a huge fucking favor and kept Bitcoin decentralized, because they saw how this cannot fucking be possible. Bitcoins biggest fucking asset, is not transaction speed or cost, it's security and the fact that it's decentralized. Pools realigned and pushed Segwit through is what happened. It was denied at first and was pushed later on. 


https://www.statista.com/statistics/751847/worldwide-seagate-western-digital-average-hard-drive-capacity/



It's rising, but it's not rising as fast as the Blockchain would rise, if we kept on increasing Blocksize. Would it have been a potential short-term solution to the scaling problem? Yes. 



Does it keep working long-term? Yes, if we give up decentralization.

"Mining contracts are offered to people as a way to mine without actually having to own the equipment or perform any of the work themselves. It essentially allows people to rent a portion of the hash rate of a larger mining operation. 

Mining has a lot of up-front costs in terms of purchasing hardware. A top-of-the-line Antminer will cost you well over $5,000. Also, mining rigs use a lot of energy and produce a good amount of noise and heat. 

So think of it as similar to renting server space. You could take the time to buy all of the server components and go through the technical work of getting it online, or you could just pay someone else to do that dirty work for you in exchange for a fee. 

I‚Äôve never bought into a cloud mining contract. I considered it at one point, but I ultimately decided it wasn‚Äôt a smart decision. I looked at a popular service, and there was wording in the contract that discussed their ability to modify the contract based on market conditions. If they can modify the contract if the price of Bitcoin goes up, then any major upside potential for the end user is virtually eliminated. 

For instance, say Bitcoin sees a remarkable rise and is worth $1 million tomorrow. The company could come back and either change the terms of the contract with you or terminate the contract altogether. From the miners perspective, your contract just became far to lucrative. At that point, it would be far more profitable to use the equipment themselves to mine and collect the rewards. Why would they let some random end user collect massive profits that they could keep for themselves. This is an extreme example, but it illustrates a key point. 

Mining contracts are really a hedging strategy that large mining consortiums use to limit their exposure to the downside potential of price decreases. They will be happy to keep your contract valid if the price goes down, but they will capitalize if there is significant upside price movement. 

My take is that if you want to mine then you should buy the hardware and do it yourself. Another alternative is to invest in proof of stake coins which allow you to earn more of the given currency just by holding. 

An example would be ARK where you simply vote for a delegate for a one-time fee of 1 ARK and then you earn about 8-10% of what you hold annually. Don‚Äôt mean to shill ARK because I do own it, but that‚Äôs just a good example of a working proof of stake project. 

TLDR: If you want to mine, buy the hardware and do it yourself. If you aren‚Äôt dead set on gaining more of a specific crypto, look into projects using proof of stake (POS) algorithms and not proof of work (POW). ",1524421371

Saying this scenario is embarassing would be implying a false equivolency.

Grouping those two groups of people (bitcoin core developers vs BCH ) and acting like the behavior between the two is somehow equal is really absurd.

You have literal scammers/fraudsters (CSW, Calvin Ayre, Roger) who are engaging in the same fraudulent and manipulative behaviors, and then you have a bunch of open source software engineers hard at work with their heads down 24/7.

Cool, so I was right. It's gonna be a shame when the authorities kick down miners doors though.

&gt;What makes you assume that level of functionality wouldn't be accessible to the average consumer at the time TB blocks are actually needed?

The state of broadband in the US is terrible, very little is being invested in improving infrastructure for consumers. Over 10 years the average internet speed in the US increased from 8Mbps to a whopping 18Mbps. With TB blocks you'd need to download 1TB every 10 minutes (potentially 2.5 minutes if some of the people in this space got their way) and then process it. That isn't going to be possible for the average consumer anytime soon.

And this isn't even mentioning 3rd world countries with little to no infrastructure who are completely screwed if blocks got that big.

&gt;If TB blocks are ever needed on BCH it will be long after BTC has been made irrelevant

I remember back then BTC was in range of sub 20k USD and blocks were crammed, everyone was screaming that we need a solution which is instant, free and doesnt require tremendous mining power. Of course then BTC declined everyone forgot this, but wait till BTC will reach 20k range again...

NANO has one very tremendous potential which isn't offered by today's market leaders - it is asynchronous operation protocol, it means that NANO is infinitely scalable. Think about the future where cryptocurrencies are massively adopted and integrated everywhere - for example your phone automatically pays with crypto for calls, data or whatever. Transactions amount may reach billions per day and even more. You wont be able to cover this with limited block size and required waiting time for mining (even if this time is in range of ten seconds). You would need a solution which instant, completely free and infinitely scalable from its core and NANO is going to this direction. This is not your standard LTC or BCH coins with improved blocks and reduced mining times, these standard coins would start to saturate really fast in terms of serious adoption, so why not try to look into better solutions?",1524420391

I don't trade BTC USD except in major bubbles. Leverage on the way up, and leverage on the way down, but only after the first big dead cat bounce. Increased my btc holdings 13% in the bubble to $1100, and more than 25% in the bubble to 19k. Easy money. 

The most success I've had by FAR is with BCH. That's why I have such a love hate relationship with it. When it bubbles to ~25% of the value of Bitcoin, or better almost half the value of Bitcoin, you can be rammed sure it's going to pop. It's just a case of buying in again at the right time and making sure you don't get greedy and make sure you're always roughly 1:1, just in case. 

The same with alts. Easy money. Small cap coins with unique value propositions will always bubble eventually and net you massive profits at somewhat high risk. I don't do this as often. To much time required to navigate FUD and hype.

Well it's worthless and not at all what the Verge team said it would be, as in ""completely anonymous and untraceable crypto"". Stealth adresses are not new, not exclusive to Verge, not even a protocol and definitely not anonymous and untraceable alone without a bunch of other features like in Monero (Ring signatures &amp; RingCT). Also optional stealth adresses are completely worthless, they need to be mandatory to be of any use.

""So the only difference with stealth addresses is essentially to move the chore of producing a unique address from the server to the client. Indeed, in some ways stealth addresses may be worse, since very few people use them, and if you are known to be one of them, it will be easier to connect stealth transactions with you.

It doesn't provide ""100% anonymity"". The fundamental anonymity weakness of Bitcoin remains - that everyone can follow the chain of payments, and if you know something about one transaction or the parties to it, you can deduce something about where those coins came from or where they went.""

https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/20701/what-is-a-stealth-address

So in conclusion: no, ""Wraith protocol"" has not been released and never will be, it was fictional hype nonsense.

""I was in Verge team when Wraith protocol was ""invented"" by M.Stolaire at those times. The name was intentionally picked to be catchy and proclaimed to be some sort of new tech.

Imagine Verge chain being attacked in future, how you will pay with such card. Useless. And I'm not even talking about that when I was in team dev said xvg will NEVER partnership with bank, ever.

Because of this mental manipulation of ""be solidary while I'm dumping shitcoins on you and LN is being built"" you actually grew upset with BCH because you don't have the coins anymore.

"The thing is, all coins based on a blockchain share the same problems. Note - I'm talking specifically about coins based on blockchain, nothing else. So I'm excluding any tangles/next-gen blockchains and what have you.

With this caveat, you get ~98% of all the coins out there, which will share the exact same problems as Bitcoin. Take ETH, for example.  As soon as CryptoKitties took off, txs skyrocketed and so did txs fees. Same basic tech, same problem. And ETH is also looking to scale via payment channels,  Raiden is their LN. Or LTC... yes, it has 4x faster blocks, but then to have the same (PoW) security, you need to wait for 4x as many confirmations. (This can be shown mathematically.) Again, same tech, same problems. 

Have to admit I don't know much/understand well the non-blockchain coins, and those might have a genuine advantage, technologically. Though we don't yet know about their security - That they have never been hacked does not mean they are secure. (Actually, IOTA has been proven to have a fundamental flaw... don't know how that ended up.) I could put up my own web server, and since no one is gonna use it except me and a few chums, it will never get hacked. But trust me when I tell you I have no idea about network security. 

But these non-blockchain coins have other problems, even assuming they are safe. The most fundamental one is lack of any real adoption with associated network effect. Can this be overcome? Sure, but it ain't easy. Not with many other much more well known coins competing. But everybody else is in the same boat.

"This is actually a situation where the limited supply makes BTC less useful. Usually you would issue new money to match the new supply that you need. Since you can't do that in Bitcoin, it would be hard for any country to ""swap"" to BTC in an elegant way. A natural switch would leave bag holders - which would typically be the most vulnerable members of society.  

I think it could be done if someone issued a BTC backed currency. E.g. If we had a ""New Duetchmark"" that was issued and was redeemable for BTC, you could swap from Euro's to ND's at a fixed exchange rate.

I think something like Dai will be more likely to be the world currency than BTC. Being able to expand and contract the money supply is important for having a high quality currency. ",1524417736

Who could ‚Äúcertify‚Äù the paper wallets in a decentralized society?

Bitcoin could be expressed into fractions of Satoshis but do you think the Developers would actually do that?

"&gt; Have you read they only keep 3% of ""our""money in cash?
  
Yes.  And putting it in quotes does not make it any less my money.  Banks are businesses in the end, and all businesses exist to make money.  They do so in this example by storing our money securely and then using it to give loans and collecting interest.  This is an agreement by both parties, not just the bank, and not just the depositor.  If you want to stuff $20,000 into your mattress or move it all to BTC because you are paranoid about the government, that I suppose is your prerogative.  I choose to use something I trust more than my mattress or the volatility of crypto.
  
&gt; Do you feel more or less secure? 
  
More secure.  I have no reliable way to keep the money I have saved more secure than in a bank.  And I am not about to flip all my fiat into BTC because I am not a moron.  Ergo, I use a bank.
  
&gt; Are you sure that banks exist to keep cash secure?
  
Yes.  See point #1.  For people like me, which is the vast majority of the population, they keep my money secure and provide loans if needed.

---------------
  
What really gets me is all the people who call me a sheep because I trust my government and I trust my bank are really good at making wide sweeping statements that come down on both items.  But to date, not a single one of them can provide me with a better solution for managing my finances.  If you DO have a way to keep your savings both secure and yet still accessible when I need it, then by all means, let's hear about it.  And again, moving all my fiat into crypto is bluntly, a really fuking stoopid idea.  BTC is far too volatile and not universally accepted as a currency.

"&gt;It's not the first phone because currency already exists and crypto currencies don't facilitate transactions better. Their currency model has already been used before in a non digital way, it was called gold standard and it was a disaster. A mass adoption of an anonymous crypto currency would probably do more to undermine social and economic stability, weaken democracies, and allow nefarious networks to prosper. You dont want to live in a world where you trade or your wage is paid in a volatile currency free from economic controls that dampen booms and busts. The fact some currencies have founder benefits and early adopter rewards shows how much of a cash grab they are. Tax evasion, extortion, illegal trade, and anonymous political contributions or corporate bribes. It's why drug cartels sit on mountains of cash they can't spend because its hard to launder. I see little benefit of a decentalized crypto currency, limit the ability to make these bad transactions and apply proper taxes and their value will disappear. Governments aren't going to sit by and allow people to avoid taxes and they will never pass the utility threshold on their own without the illicit benefits. It's literally a ponzi scheme that has the illusion of utility, why else is there so many alt coins, the majority don't do anything better than the other it's just early adopters trying to make money off the suckers that buy in later. Maybe there is a greater cause philosophy in an Orwellian dystopia, or maybe crypto currencies are just people trying to cheat to get more for themselves while creating a sense of legitimacy at the expense of social norms.

This was well over a month ago. When someone says they are short and they don't use leverage, that means they probably sold BCH they personally owned with a view to buying back lower. As opposed a short which can mean borrowing an asset you don't own. This was well over a month ago. How can you think i would still have the same position open when ive told you inbetween that time that i bought a load...So I called it dropping from 0.12 to 0.09. I even told you I would start progressively buying from 0.09 unless it doesn't go as expected. Ie I was ready to change my plan. Which I even told you about... i told you I bought a load and then sold it again. How am I meant to be anything other than smug? Which I haven't been.... except when you start trash talking like a stupid kid...



I even told you this as it happened. I told you my 0.12 nearly got hit so I cancelled them planning to sell a little lower if need be, but it shot up instead, so I sold about 25% making a nice little profit. That was at 0.129~ and like I said I still have a 1:1 ratio of btc to BCH pretty much...



Yea, that last one was a taking the piss comment in reply to someone who said LN was like giving up btc altogether when even satoshis envisioned payment channels. Obviously not a serious comment...

I think alot of people are (rightfully so) frustrated with the r/bitcoin moderation policy and percieve it to be opiniated censorship. Andreas is a spokesperson that is very strong in his opinion on censorship; but he does not talk much about it in the r/bitcoin form.

Personally, I don't really care what goes on in r/bitcoin anymore, it's a subreddit, it is owned by people that want it to be in certain ways, and I am free to not take part in it.

I ask because there is some confusion regarding exactly what you are selling. See for example this post on the electrum forum:

And then you just have to look in the mirror and ask yourself if people can have different opinions.  Like, it is your *opinion* that BCH is better than Btc, and many people out there are not so sure, and for different reasons.  You think everyone out there wants something, well others want other things, and that‚Äôs not necessarily censorship but rather a difference of opinion.

Censorship *is* wrong, but blaming Btc for the censorship and pasting it in a bad light because of bad actors in the space, is jumping to a level that doesn‚Äôt relate, except in your mind, which is ‚Äúoutraged.‚Äù

And the highest ever multiple was very briefly 2:1 during the panic event when B2x was suddenly called off.

"&gt;again, why are we having this conversation when it's clear, to me at least, that gold has already lost this battle? 

We are having this conversation because we both continue to engage in it.

And just because something is ""clear to you"" does not mean that it is clear in general, or in anyway correct.

It is perfectly ""clear"" to countless people that fiat dollars function just fine as money. That doesn't make it true.

&gt;no one uses gold for money. they don't even use if for backing anymore. why do you persist with the delusion?

I do. I use gold as an inflation-protected form of cash savings--as an alternative to fiat currency, that allows me to keep high liquidity to buy undervalued investments in the future without taking on long-term currency risk.

I also use it as a unit of account, a medium for comparing the relative price and value of goods over long periods, and an instrument of long-range financial planing.

If you actually study the long term price of other items in gold, you'll quickly realize why it is preferable to dollars to this purposes.
For instance, in very recent years, oil has gone from a low of $30 to a high of $160 in a matter of years. But not long ago, $10 would have been a very high price!

Meanwhile, priced in gold, you can get anywhere from 10-25 barrels an ounce, going back more than 100 years. This is a much smaller and much more stable price fluctuation.

Gold continues to work as money, even when people don't use it as such, because of how well mining costs track real energy costs over time. Try browsing pricedingold.com and see for yourself.

&gt;please clarify if you're referrring to the regression theorum as it relates to real ""goods"" or ""commodities"". i think we agree that Bitcoin's ledger does have real value and utility so let's get rid of the tradional commodity talk.

The word ""commodity"" or ""good"" still applies. Look it up and you'll see why! You can have digital goods and digital commodities. Anyway, this is a semantic argument. I'm talking about the underlying principles. It doesn't matter what words you use to describe them.

&gt;sure, we're speculating as to whether Bitcoin can become a unit of acct and economic calculation. i think it can, it's just too early.

Fair enough. We'll have to wait and see. It's possible. But it has not happened yet, and at present, good works better at this function than either Bitcoin or dollars.

&gt;no one's using gold for anything money related today. 

Again, I do. And it works great! It performs just as it always has.

&gt;wow, i hadn't realized you've planned space projects.

Why would you assume I haven't?

I have been involved in evaluating complex terrestrial mining proposals, and in evaluating the books of companies that are involved in aerospace. They are both complex and costly enough as is, and combining the two together would only complicate it further!

&gt;in any event, you should check out this thread that originated in 2011. all your questions and doubts are answered right in there: https://bitco.in/forum/threads/gold-collapsing-bitcoin-up.16/

That does answer any of my doubts. What I would need to see is:

1) A proposal from a company that can reasonably demonstrate that their cost to mine gold in space could profit me more than mining it here on earth. Then, the proposal would be upgraded to ""speculative"" and potentially worth investing in.

2) We would then need to see this project executed at a profit, and a comparable one to what was advertised at that.

Waving a magic wand and saying ""there's gold in them there asteroids"" does not effect supply and demand in the real world or in space. It doesn't work for terrestrial mining, and it doesn't work for anything else. Believing the tall tales of every speculator will get you killed, financially speaking.

Gold existing, and gold being profitable to extract are two *very* different things. There is a tremendous amount of gold in the deep sea floor right now for instance. The problem is the cost of extracting it, relative to terrestrial mining and relative to demand. So there it stays.",1524414132

"They'll do some kind of media push to get people into Lightning, and it won't be enough. And they'll say next time Lightning will prevent the rush, because we'll make segwit transactions mandatory with a soft-fork in which miners will agree only to process like 25% of blocks as non-segwit transactions and the rest have to wait. So segwit will get a 75% fee reduction and 75% allocated blocks.

They'll keep trying to squeeze out all other approaches until you basically can't do regular on-chain transactions without segwit and then they'll make it more and more expensive even as segwit to try to force people onto 2nd layers.

Including their own 2nd layer called Liquid, which is on their website r/bitcoin doesn't much talk about. Here is the Blockstream website talking about their plans for a Blockstream controlled sidechain tech called Liqdui in which **Blockstream would reap ALL transaction fees**, and for which they envision being used almost like Ripple, for settlement between banks, exchanges, and likely sovereign powers.

https://blockstream.com/liquid/

At some point they begin telling people about their new *optional* service where you sign-up for a Blockstream account and THEY take care of running the Lightning node for you and setting up everything. You just have an account with them, like a checking account, and they do everything from there. And since they will already have accounts with the exchanges and banks by that point, they hope to become the major hub for all bitcoin transactions thereby.

And since it's optional, they can keep claiming they're not destroying trustlessness and decentralization, even though they are.",1524414073

Having said this ..... I also asked him on reddit why he doesn't called out r/bitcoin and he said he doesn't because its the largest platform to reach users and doesn't want to be blackballed.  He did say he didn't support the censorship.  ",1524412960
"&gt; No my only argument was that he wouldn't be running a fully syncing node to avoid censorship. Which he won't.

Aaaaand, *you don't need to* as he had assumed.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;Also, I was at Satoshi's Vision conference in which he revised those numbers after studying his assumptions and, iirc, brings the figure down to about $25,000 a year, rather than what he'd assumed previously.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; It was much higher than that and the new numbers were based on a whole lot of stuff that isn't available to the average person especially on the networking side. The talk is targeted towards companies, it's actually a lot more expensive for the average person.

Regardless, the price keeps coming down, and that price is for TB blocks today, so it's not like we're assuming people would actually ever have to pay that price. What makes you assume that level of functionality wouldn't be accessible to the average consumer at the time TB blocks are actually needed?

If TB blocks are ever needed on BCH it will be long after BTC has been made irrelevant, or has hard-forked to fix the issues we've identified that keep it from scaling, even with Lightning around.


&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;And that's still assuming TB blocks were needed TODAY, which they are not.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Neither is 32mb blocks and yet there is an upcoming hard fork.

You could take the cap off tomorrow and it wouldn't matter. Forking the block-cap upwards is not the same as saying blocks will suddenly become 32mb in size, quite obviously. Increasing capacity is about our commitment as a network of developers to the vision of scaling on-chain, and the block-cap will likely keep increasing for some time now.

The limit only exists to keep trolls from trying to spam literally a TB block today.

"**Laplace's demon**

In the history of science, Laplace's demon was the first published articulation of causal or scientific determinism by Pierre-Simon Laplace in 1814. According to determinism, if someone (the Demon) knows the precise location and momentum of every atom in the universe, their past and future values for any given time are entailed; they can be calculated from the laws of classical mechanics.

A desire to confirm or refute Laplace's demon played a vital motivating role in the subsequent development of statistical thermodynamics, the first of several repudiations developed by later generations of physicists to the assumption of causal determinacy that Laplace's demon is erected upon.

"&gt; Decentralisation prevents centralised entities (2 miners in that scenario) being able to force changes on the network. It is not tangential to decentralisation at all.

Yeah, and what about developer centralization? Core-partisans don't like to even think about that and the fact that Core has completely taken control of BTC's protocol. This is far more dangerous than threats from miner-centralization at this time. You worry about miners forcing any kind of change, but Core devs have already forced all kinds of changes and the refused to change anything ever again after they got their way.

&gt; Your assertion that contentious hard forks are good is subjective,

Never said that. At the very least, I don't believe bitcoin should ""never fork again"" as is the opinion of BTC Core, contentious or not.

I don't think a contentious fork should necessarily go through. But non-contentious ones certainly should. The problem in BTC was that the Core devs never wanted to fork again and THEY created contention when forked neared.

With 2x you have 90%+ miners flagging agreement. There was no contention on the community side, all contention came directly from the Core devs. A group of like 10 people who happen to control the Github repo. If you don't consider that a significant form of centralization of control, then I can't help you.

&gt; I subjectively believe that without overwhelming consensus, the status quo should be preserved. 

But 90% wasn't good enough for you? Come on.

&gt; but let's not pretend your position is more valid. 

My position is more valid even on your own terms. 90% is overwhelming consensus.

&gt; I think there are benefits where a minority cannot ever accept the status quo and start their own little chains, they have already been rejected by the markets and will eventually fall to zero. You fight your corner because you understandably hope that won't be the case. There's also a lot of victim complex and conspiracy from those on the losing side of a contentious fork, which is a shame.

We didn't lose the fork. The only, only reason we are BCH right now and not called BTC is because a Core ally holds the Github repo control. That's literally the only reason. Gavin is a BCH supporter and previously held the Github repo control. Had he stuck around awhile longer, things would be very different. People who now control BTC would've had to fork BTC to get it to be the way it is now, and BCH would be the mainstream direction, the direction that bitcoin had ALWAYS been moving in while Satoshi and Gavin were in control of it.

This isn't ""victim complex"" or conspiracy, this is direct and necessary conclusion from the bald facts of history.",1524412710

Best for him? How is it best for him behind core? I expect he has lost the respect of many/most that support [Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin/) (BCH). If I was him, I know at least part of me would be very disappointed with myself. And that feeling may never go away (unless the switch is made). If he had started support immed. when BCH first came to be like Roger he would have only pissed off the crippled coin sheep. But since he has let it go this long, he is likely now in a lose-lose scenario... short-term.

**But more importantly is the long term.** And in this, I would think he could re-gain (much of anyway) the respect of the Cash community with a heartfelt mea culpa. But the longer he stays planted where he is, the harder the change will become... but maybe not...
______________
**One possibility for why Andreas didn't switch like Roger. **

Even though it was clear that core had hi-jacked bitcoin (even to Andreas-as his earlier comments attest), it very likely had to feel like a HUGE risk/gamble to switch (and in effect-at least to a degree-start over!). Both had dedicated their lives for yrs to bitcoin. And then comes a day where they have to choose... one or the other. Roger made the leap since he KNEW he could no longer support something that was NOT what he had consistently promoted AND believed in! Andreas wasnt strong enough to make the leap then. And now, as each day passes, it likely becomes even harder to make the leap... except it IS easier to switch now! BCH is NOT at the beginning AND has made tremendous strides in a short time! There are people switching everyday. Some have told their stories here! There is a wide range of new/exciting developments. And there are going to be MANY MANY more!

"Im not familiar with vechains consensus model, just following up intertrons argument. 

Decentralization is the key that makes blockchain so unique. It makes it possible to use trust in a system where it couldn't before, the Internet. You know that an entry in the Bitcoin chain for example hasn't been double spent, hasn't been changed after the fact and so on.

If a chain is controlled by a single entity is in control of the chain you trust them to not change transactions after the fact, not print coins for themselves or ""partners"", not stop certain actors from using their platform and so on.

Lets say a government like Russia or USA wants to change the rules on a chain in their favor, or maybe ban an actor that is using the chain. With a central governance model they could use their resources to ultimately get their will.

In a centralized but open source chain (like NEO) the community could at least hard fork away the chain that got corrupted by a state. 

In a decentralized and open source chain (like Ethereum) the attack is extremely unlikely to succeed to begin with, because there is no central point to attack. And if it did, the community could also hard fork.


As i said, I havent looked at vechain enough to know which category they fall in to, but if its centralized I would personally only ride the investment short term. I believe that as more people get the hang on what brings actual value and new possibilities to this world, the centralized chains will die out.",1524412044

"&gt;Bitcoin can be money b/c the market has figured out how to identify exactly what is a good money: divisibility, fungibility, security, and immutability.

You forgot ""store of value"" and ""suitability as a unit of account"" ;)

Money has to have some real utility value to store, so it can reliably and predictably store purchasing power over time relative to other goods, and therefore serve as a unit of account and economic calculation.

Currently, Bitcoin cannot do that last part. Whether it will be able to in the future remains to be seen. Although it may be possible, it is entirely speculative.

&gt;imo, you confuse the issue when you use terms like commodity and good to describe Bitcoin. it is neither of those; it skipped that step and went straight to being a money when 10000BTC were traded for two pizzas.

No, it is not ""confusing"" the issue, but rather ""revealing the underlying reality"".

Bitcoin does have some degree of real utility value: It allows the holder to write data to a secure, decentralized, permanent public ledger.

That's it's utility value. That is what it ""does"". That is why it is worth anything at all.

Scarcity alone cannot create value. If it could, mercurcy would cost as much as silver, rather than orders of magnitude less.

&gt;i totally disagree. i think creating more gold supply by increasing mining is a distinct negative. did it occur to you that 2% annual growth of population and consumption is actually unsustainable as it compounds exponentially? Bitocin's fixed 21M coin supply will level off growth of a fixed resource planet. of course, technology will continue to advance improving all our lives.

No, it did not occur to me that human population growth of 2% is unsustainable, because it's not unsustainable. This ""Malthusian canard"" has been disproven time and time again since the time of Thomas Malthus.

This is because, in addition to compounding population growth, there are also *compounding increases in human productivity*.

The amount of food available to humans, for instance, grows even faster than population does, thanks to human ingenuity. Humankind is not necessarily even confined to this planet over the very long term, as I imagine you might agree, what with your penchant for asteroid mining.

In any event, even if I were wrong, and human population begins to stabilize or decline, then guess what? So would the new gold supply. It is naturally elastic, responding to market demand. That is a feature.

&gt;those asteroids are filled with heavy metal assets lik gold, IOW huge supplies. when those get harvested, the gold price will plummet and there will go your money attribute. gold has already clearly lost. i don't even know why we're talking about this.

Again, you are ignoring the very real energy and other costs of first finding gold in space, then planning a mission, building the equipment, training a crew, acquiring financing, launching a rocket into space, returning a huge asteroid to earth, whether in chunks or all at once, and then processing and refining the resulting ore and bringing it to market.

This costs nearly $1300 an ounce to do right here on earth. In space, it would likely cost considerably more.

You really just aren't thinking through the details of the actual business enterprise of space mining. You have to factor in the effective cost per ounce needed to add to supply. You can't just assume it away, or assume it will be lower than on earth. That seems a bit juvenile, if you'll pardon me, and suggests a lack of familiarity with the reality of planning and executing such projects.",1524411368

"Like I've said in other posts, the segway for Ripple to maximize xRapid adoption and the appreciation of XRP's price will primarily be through their premier blockchain tech solutions: xCurrent or xVia. With xCurrent/xVia FIs are only achieving ~30% in transactional cost savings. Along with xRapid, they can achieve the ~42% in total cost savings Ripple's tech will provide them (See: https://ripple.com/files/xrp_cost_model_paper.pdf Pgs: 7-10). Bankers are capitalistic creatures. It wouldn't make sense for them not to take full advantage of all cost-saving measures available to them. However, you have to crawl before you can walk. When you go to purchase a new car, you don't just randomly pick the first one you see. You test drive it, look at different models, brands, etc. Same thing here, banks are trialing/using the foundational blockchain tech (xCurrent or xVia) first.  It's not that Ripple isn't promoting xRapid, they are (i.e. Western Union, MoneyGram, Cuallix, MercuryFx, IDT, etc.). The primary reasons we have yet to see mainstream adoption and usage of XRP/xRapid among banks/FIs is that the crypto market lacks institutional-grade hedging, custody instruments, and a defined regulatory framework to help them mitigate risk associated with the volatility. Miguel Vias, Head of XRP Markets at Ripple, offered some insights as to Ripple's plans for its XRP holdings for 2018 in the 2017 Q4 XRP Markets Report: ""While customers can use XRP for on-demand liquidity through xRapid, we want to build the necessary market infrastructure for eventual direct usage of XRP by financial institutions. In Q1, we'll begin work towards the launch of institutional hedging instruments and custody solutions. Both of these market components are important to institutional adoption and thus are important components of our 2018 roadmap."" You also have to remember that Ripple's clients (banks, FIs, Central Banks, etc.) are some of the most conservative in the space. Plus, they have to work within the confines of strict regulatory standards (i.e. AML, KYC, CFT). Due to the premature regulatory framework along with the aforementioned liquidity, custody, and hedging issues that exist in the crypto markets, **Ripple had the foresight to know that adoption of XRP/xRapid among their particular clientele would be slow, hence xCurrent and xVia were developed. There is nothing controversial with xCurrent or xVia as they are doing the same thing as SWIFT + their correspondent banking partners by solving the settlement issue (i.e. communication/traceability/accountability/settlement) of FIAT payment transfers between banks, but better, faster, more secure, etc.** The controversial piece for banks is the adoption of Ripple's digital asset (xRapid/XRP) for liquidity. As banks become comfortable with xCurrent and xVia and build services upon these solutions the next logical step is the integration of xRapid/XRP.",1524410821

https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/introducing-the-vechain-multi-party-payment-protocol-525daf1bee7

&gt;Why is this a massive problem for mass adoption of public blockchain?

&gt;In some regards, the solutions put in place by early blockchain models to combat issues of governance and payment, created additional problems. One of the most straightforward issues arisen is the necessity of every transaction to include a network fee paid in cryptocurrency. In this case, enterprises are not able to pay for the fees of their non-asset holding customers and therefore are met with hurdles in regards to proving data ownership and providing value transfer of everyday users. Additionally, there aren‚Äôt real solutions in place by the market to seamlessly integrate these users onto the chain in a meaningful way. Through MPP, we can claim this as a solution to both the integration of new users and multi-party payment procedures removing significant obstacles to public blockchain adoption.

&gt;How does MPP solve issues other public blockchains cannot?

&gt;For the existing blockchain networks such as BitCoin and Ethereum, the answer to multi-party payments is non-existent. This is because whenever we use the blockchain services, whether it is transferring cryptocurrency, upload data, and executing smart contracts, we have to send transactions to the network and pay for the transactions using our own account balances.

&gt;In the VeChainThor Blockchain, we recognize this critical problem and came up with a novel multi-layer payment model, as illustrated in the below figure. It can be seen that a VeChainThor Blockchain transaction can be paid by three different parties. They are the transaction sender, the smart contract which the transaction‚Äôs recipient, or the contract‚Äôs sponsor. 

Contract's sponsor here refers to a 3rd party which handles the crypto side of things and pay in crypto for the normies, and they collect payment in fiat from normies. This isn't possible for Bitcoin or Ethereum in its current state. 

Since the scope of both Vechain and IOTA are each so freaking wide, I see no reason why IOTA can't do the same thing as Vechain in the future. Also, first mover advantage is very important in this space. Vechain did it first and it's doing it with a blockchain, which has transaction fees and is trusted, proven by Bitcoin. So Vechain has solved a critical problem for blockchain here. In addition, it also allows payments to be done in that way, not just for transaction fees. IOTA doesn't have transaction fees altogether but it hasn't solved, AFAIK, the problem of normies being reluctant to buy cryptocurrency for payments. Yet IOTA is doing something so wildly different and radical that it may render all blockchain projects obselete, or they may also fail. It's still very early days for IOTA.

Imagine the dominant bitcoin had 32mb blocks with a fleshed out scaling plan including successful testing of GB+ blocks , support by every major crypto business, project, and service, guaranteed sub-cent fees and a more the merrier growth strategy for true global adoption.

Now imagine some upstart devs forked off and reduced block size to 1mb, heavily restricting transactional capacity to create a fluctuating fee market intended to produce long term fees in excess of $100+ driving users to a second layer system of fee taking government regulated financial intermediaries they call ‚Äúhubs‚Äù.

Would this new high fee coin see any traction whatsoever?

It needs to be understood that the current BTC price is the result of incumbency, not merit. Any suggestion that the market could never come to the realisation that the Blockstream/Core redesign of bitcoin was a mistake is pure cult ideology.

BCH is gaining against BTC for very sound fundamental reasons, rational traders need to position themselves to ideally profit or at minimum protect their holdings in the event of a switch.

Remember that they share miners and unlike BCH, BTC lacks any facility to survive a significant loss of hashrate. If BCH continues its strong push toward price parity then the miners will jump ship and the BTC chain will genuinely cease to function, dropping its worth to $0.

I think a stock sell-off could create some capital to flow here, but I just don't think the infrastructure has improved enough to get fiat into crypto. Plus the exchanges have had a relatively easy time with it but I still don't think they're ready to handle the massive boost in volume that we get with bull runs. Would seem like at this point we're still just going on the day to day manipulation that we've seen for 90% of the last 7-8 months.",1524403740

Why is Bitcoin Cash the only fork which should be able to call itself ""Bitcoin"" and why should supporters of that minority fork be allowed to rename Bitcoin as they see fit?

Some much lower numbers if your account would have 99M.  Unless it would be specific account for ""saving"". I think they offer some decent revenue, like 3% or so with no risk. Or quite a bit higher risks if you want more.

Also for such a big accounts, they usually have pretty special offers and care.

"Again, you haven't addressed the point.  The token is just a method for representing a trade.  Gold works as a token of sorts, but the problem is if the token becomes too valuable it stops being good at representing small trades and becomes a less efficient token.  If you have no other tokens to use, this can slow down trade as the double coincidence of wants comes into play.

If, however, that token can divide infinitely, it's value can now grow infinitely with no detrimental effect on trade.

Of *course* the number of decimal places is arbitrary.  It's the potential to expand and contract based on the economy's need that makes it better than gold as a commodity-as-a-currency.

My whole point is that the inflation model of the US dollar is an attempt to address this; if the dollar gets too valuable, it stops being useful.  Since our goal is to grow our economy, without inflation this will inevitably happen to the dollar too.  Therefore they need inflation to keep the US dollar from experiencing this problem.  We *want* the US dollar to lose little bits of value over time so it doesn't force an economic contraction due to a loss of liquidity (like we experienced with gold).  Bitcoin doesn't have this problem.

"Pretty much every community you're in in real life is self-moderated.  And the early internet was as well, at least with email discussion groups.  You pay attention to the content you are interested in, and ignore, or even personally censor, content that you are not interested in.  The whole system is censorship free because it's decentralized.  You get to control only what you say and pay attention to, but you don't get to interfere with what anyone else says or gets to hear/see.  That's the only healthy way to have a system, since it removes discrimination by the majority.

This is why Bitcoin was invented.  It's obviously not perfect, and isn't really decentralized, as the developers have the ultimate say in how it works, but the ideology behind Bitcoin is to at least have it be as egalitarian as possible, with the control being open to anyone who wants to participate and has the resources to do so, instead of being governed entirely by corporations.

When some group gets to tell everyone else what they can and can't do, we automatically both miss the chance to use the resources that the repressed individuals have to offer, but we also cause them to act aggressively in retaliation, in some way.  Which is why you see so much spam, trolling, conflict, and generally negative interactions in these kinds of communities.  If you want healthy interactions, you don't start out from the beginning by harming people (using force/violence in some way, physically, emotionally, intellectually, or philosophically to prevent them from doing what they would really like to do).",1524402885

It basically can put those in power in check as well but this cannot happen with a tangible and completely private coin. Trust is removed for it's sake and now have to keep their word. 

Having a trust-less payment system is revolutionary and huge. Having a private coin with the characteristics of physical cash is also huge. Sadly, they are polar opposites. What improves one,  damages the other. Now that we know we can have multiple cryptos, there will be others, like me, will be okay with having both a trust-less currency and a private currency.

Bitcoin Whitepaper: A Beginner‚Äôs Guide
Bitcoin Whitepaper: A Beginner‚Äôs Guide
September 15, 2017

Read an important announcement about Bitcoin from Bitcoin.com

The Bitcoin whitepaper, Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, was published in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto.

Bitcoin is revolutionizing the global payments industry and people around the world are rethinking the meaning of their money. Moreover, the underlying technology and network that process Bitcoin transactions, known as blockchain, is transforming industries as varied as banking, farming, logistics, healthcare, elections and manufacturing, to name a few.

All this is made possible by Satoshi Nakamoto‚Äôs groundbreaking work published in 2008 which outlines what Bitcoin is and how it works. There are many projects now with the word ‚Äúbitcoin‚Äù in them. Most of these are ‚Äúforks‚Äù of the Bitcoin software. There are many properties that seperate these different versions but only one is most inline with the original vision of Bitcoin as presented in the whitepaper. This is Bitcoin Cash. For the remainder of this article, when the term ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äù is used, we are referring to Bitcoin Cash (BCH).

To learn more about the differences between Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin Core (BTC) check out this guide. 

How To Use This Guide
Bitcoin.com offers a simplified explanation of Nakamoto‚Äôs work. We provide annotations for all 10 sections of the whitepaper.

Text in italics is used to provide commentary and to distinguish the author‚Äôs views from those of Satoshi Nakamoto‚Äôs.

1. Introduction
Bitcoin creator, Satoshi Nakamoto discusses the web‚Äôs reliance on trusted third parties such as banks and credit card companies to process electronic payments. The traditional method may work for most transactions but problems do occur when financial institutions facilitate the buying and selling of goods on the internet.

Here are some of the weaknesses of traditional electronic payments involving third parties:

Transactions can be reversed since banks must mediate disputes that inevitably arise.
Think of disputes that routinely take place between merchants, consumers and other parties, such as payment processors, PayPal or tax authorities.

Banks‚Äô intervention (i.e., mediation) increases transaction costs and this also limits the minimum practical transaction size. The reversibility of transactions becomes a problem when a provider has delivered non-reversible services.
Consumers frequently buy low-cost items on the web, such as $5 keychains and $10 eyeglasses. However, bank involvement costs a lot and these costs are passed on to consumers through transaction fees and other charges. Consider all the mediation and litigation expenses that pile up in a given year and you can see that transaction costs can be significant. Moreover, if a provider completes a service he should rightfully get paid. But the current system allows transactions to be reversed, putting a service provider at risk of not getting paid.

The possibility of a transaction‚Äôs reversal hangs over everyone. And that requires people to trust a third party such as banks to resolve payment disputes.
Many merchants and consumers don‚Äôt want to trust a financial institution. They‚Äôre expensive; may not be trustworthy; are frequently hacked; and often give too much information to the government without informing the affected party. All this also create privacy concerns. In this section, Nakamoto outlines the limitations of the traditional payment system, and he is setting up the audience for his proposed solutions.

The system accepts a certain percentage of fraud as unavoidable. Nonetheless, fraud increases everyone‚Äôs cost of doing business. Nakamoto proposes an electronic payment system that is based on cryptographic proof instead of trust.
Cryptography involves the use of codes and protocols to establish secure communications.

Such a system would let two parties transact directly with each other. The new method, namely Bitcoin, features the following:

Peer-to-peer payments over an online network.
The elimination of third parties and replacing trust with verification.
Transactions would be irreversible and Nakamoto argues that irreversibility would protect sellers from fraud. Escrow mechanisms can be implemented to protect buyers.
A peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server would generate mathematical proof of the chronological order of transactions. The system is secure so long as honest participants collectively control more computing power than attackers/hackers.
Nakamoto believes that it‚Äôs better to verify transactions rather than trust an external third party, especially when it comes to something as important as money. The irreversibility of transactions provides confidence that the payment system as a whole is robust. Secondly, irreversibility minimizes fraud, he argues. Decentralized computers would prove the exact order of these irreversible transactions, creating user confidence that the records in the electronic audit trail, the blockchain, are valid and accurate.

2. Transactions
In this section, Nakamoto‚Äôs description of the electronic transaction process, namely the blockchain, gets technical. In simple terms, he defines an electronic ‚Äúcoin‚Äù as a chain of digital signatures. Owners digitally sign a hash of the previous transaction and add a public key of the next owner to the end of the coin. A recipient of the coin, a payee, can verify the signatures in order to verify the chain of ownership.

&gt;A Bitcoin doesn‚Äôt exist anywhere per se, at least not in the traditional sense of physical cash. Rather, Nakamoto‚Äôs concept of an electronic ‚Äúcoin‚Äù is a chronological series of verified digital signatures. 

SegWit breaks the chain of signatures so Bitcoin Segwit is pretty much worthless now the market has yet to realise this however.",1524402512
"Lol, this is right down the street from me. There is always some like lonely CMU school girl there petting cats.

Thais are really into crypto now. There is a BTC ATM in  imman district and even the lady thay does my laundry was checkinf her account the other day.",1524402512
"This is basically the HODL meme, no? If anything this gives whales more power over the price, if it‚Äôs less liquid, think low volume alts, easier to manipulate.

Yes money has been made from that meme mentality, but unless you were straight up an early investor (probably already retired), it‚Äôs a cop out for buying in at the wrong price &amp; hoping it will increase eventually.
If it doesn‚Äôt, then what? Keep on holding ? 

To answer your question, I don‚Äôt think volatility will change until there is a LOT more volume &amp; the exchanges with said volume have regulations being followed with a better system of bodies in place to enforce this. People will disagree but if the average joe doesn‚Äôt have some form of protection from manipulation, insider T etc then this is not ready for complete mainstream adoption. 

For example the short / long squeeze rinse and repeat isn‚Äôt even remotely subtle any more. &amp; this is being run through btc with the highest volume.

"you have answer in your comment, that bitcoin benefits from altcoins more than other away round because these altcoins brought/bring many talents to the crypto space and many top investors (and people) too. If these 100s of different applications didnt come and bitcoin's only use case was the darknets, then it wont even go to $2000-3000, that's my judgement because new people wont try to catch what was already 1000x times, but as you said people now try to catch next ""bitcoin"" which bring new people, so actually it is bitcoin which is benefited more from altcoins than altcoins are benefited from bitcoin.

"It's not crazy tricks. The community split and each side is a chain from the Genesis block. Of course there is drama on who is more legit. BCH believes big blocks and on chain for now. BTC wants sidechains asap. It may be that BCH will require off chain scaling too but the way BTC developers didn't want to make cheap on chain transactions available while still possible is why the split occured. BTC seems to justify this off chain system as ""planning ahead"". BCH will adjust when it has to through community agreement ",1524402407
"This sub has clearly been overrun by bch fanboys and only pro bch arguments get main lined regardless of how ""open"" you claim this thread remains with any opposing views getting brigaded. Just check my karma score for proof. It's certainly -- no longer accurate-- to have /btc be synonymous with bcash (as you would claim) but I get the propaganda perspective to not changing or adapting to current conditions.  Btc is no longer about all of bitcoin and hasn't been in a long time since it has forked into something like 27 alts along with the original btc... but here we are. It's a ""quirk"" as you call it. I call it propaganda. ",1524402390
"Sure lightning network is truly working to get a btc node in every phone. That's totally where its going.

Also there's a higher chance your phone can run the bch blockchain at that time than LN allowing any user to make a channel that's not a huge data center. That's what soft forks upgrades do, take decisions for the top brass and convince the lower levels that the decisions are in their best interests. ",1524402353
Bitcoin is not meant to be a hedge against inflation. Just like by decree fiat broke away from gold. Now fiat is being replaced. This is the transformation period. These old world terms don‚Äôt apply. Don‚Äôt be the last one hodling the paper bag full of paper. Gold will always be a hedge against inflation. In the near term you are not going to see this play out but gold has some upside in the future. Bitcoin is new money. Some other alts will be new money. And once they take hold into the real economies inflation will set in. Remember inflation is increasing the money supply. And this new money will have no debt attached to it. ,1524402352

You're trying to tacke what is considered a ""hard problem"", and it has been both discussed and tried to be solved before.

Don't let that stop you from trying again; if there's anything I've learnt from the ""The Bitcoin Origin Story"" at http://vu.hn/bitcoin%20origins.html it is that people that can look at a problem from a different perspective has a unique position to bring clarity by challenging assumptions.",1524401537
"you are right, though i would rather call it a moral appeal. i try not to get into technicals because most people around here seem to lack basic understanding of how blockchains work and what specific kind of problems they solve. 

for example the whole tipprbot hype completely ignores the fact that they could as well just fund their accounts with wired dollars, dogecoin or amazon giftcards as it is just a centralized database keeping track of their spending. 

anyway, i'm more than happy to debate you on a technical level. and i'd add that nobody looses in a debate if the goal is to gain knowledge and insight. 

first to be clear, when you say ""the fork that took place"" what event are you referencing?

as for the whitepaper: i just fail to see where it tells me to be dogmatic about everything satoshi has written. in fact pretty soon after the initial release other people started contributing to the codebase, up until today with an ever growing number of different developers adding to what has become one of the coolest open source projects in history. since i first heard about bitcoin, hundreds of new developers contributed to bitcoin and i think we should really welcome them, not create a strange kind of founders cult around satoshi, chocking any further innovation that is built on top of the existing tech. 

i just don't understand your appeal to the whitepaper as for me bitcoin is working exactly as it should. as someone who has experienced the feeling of seriously having to consider if downloading a 30mb video file from the internet is really worth it due to bandwidth cost, i can easily see that high fees on bitcoin will be a temporary issue as the infrastructure is being built to enable exponential scaling. looking back it will be the ""old days"" when sending bitcoin used to be very expensive as only broadcast was possible and network throughput was small. now we are entering the age of bitcoin unicast transactions, which will enable true mainstream adoption. ",1524401423
"**Agorism**

Agorism is a libertarian social philosophy that advocates creating a society in which all relations between people are voluntary exchanges by means of counter-economics, thus engaging with aspects of peaceful revolution. It was first proposed by libertarian philosopher Samuel Edward Konkin III at two conferences, CounterCon I in October 1974 and CounterCon II in May 1975, both conferences organized by J. Neil Schulman.

Just an example iota is 2$ and if they achieve their vision it can be 300$ in 5-10 years. Youd have made 150.000-300.000$.

Bitcoin had followed a rather clear path forward for years (raising block sizes and focusing on on-chain transactions) but suddently found itself pushing for an alternate visions; a vision where transaction was supposed to happen off-chain and the chain itself limited.

Alot of people didn't like this idea, tried to compromise and find a way to reconcile these two fundamentally different views, and ultimately failed.

"&gt; It's just so weird to see someone shout ""shitcoin"" and defend centralized bullshit like Ripple in the process. Each to their own.

I wasn't defending Ripple, we were arguing whether LTC has a real use case vs XRP, and frankly I don't see that. Personally, I don't know what are the possible circumstances that would make me use LTC instead of BTC, after LN.

I value decentralization, that's why I'm invested in BTC and can't put anything alongside with it, especially the coins which basically tried to 'pivot' from btc. Once LN goes live, it is basically game-over for most of yall.

I find it pretty hard for BTC to be the first adopted by banks due to regulations, so xrp is basically building the rails for BTC to follow, so that sums up the 'Ripple bringing mainstream..'

As you might know, Ripple also brought the interledger which supports and connects ledgers and blockchains, so that is the main reason why I give respect to them as they are playing a fair game.

"Funny, I was actually thinking about this. Here's one reason most people don't talk about:

He's currently working on a book on Ethereum, about to publish soon. I'm sure that's his primary thing at the moment. And working on this book means:

1. He's very vested into Ethereum's success (He's spent a lot of his resources into working on this book and probably wants to get the same level of respect from ETH developers as he has from the BTC community)
2. While working on this book he's likely to have come to a conclusion that the crypto world will become somewhat of a two-party system (BTC &amp; ETH), which means that Bitcoin will only be used as gold (plus lightning), and all the cool things Bitcoin used to be able to do should be handled by Ethereum (Point 1 probably also contributed to this bias)
3. He probably had reached this conclusion before BCH became a formidable alternative. And add to the fact that he's working on an Ethereum book, and it's probably that he thinks it will be: BTC as gold, ETH as application, and Lightning as actual transaction.

He probably doesn't even realize this himself but there's a subtle conflict of interest here because just looking at what he's been spending his time on, he's been all in on educating Bitcoin, and now wants to become the ""Ethereum guru"" as well, so the best case scenario for him is a world where BTC and ETH coexist. In this view of the world, BCH cannot fit in because BCH is all about on-chain, from payment to store of value to application execution.

That said, I do not think he's being ""shilled"" by Blockstream, etc., it's much more likely that he's come to this conclusion on his own, which is kind of sad because I used to respect this guy. He's also just a human after all so he can't escape the rule of the world.",1524400334

&gt; So again, you're out there shilling LTC, but you actually seem to know there isn't a place where it can fit in the ecosystem, long term. With LN coming out, what is LTC purpose?


Where am I shilling Litecoin? I stating facts. Litecoin is cheap and fast, do you want to argue that? Litecoin is aiming to be decentralized, do you want to argue that? Ripple is never aiming to be decentralized, but cheap and fast, do you want to argue that? Pardon me, but I fail to see where exactly I'm shilling anything. Litecoin is cheap, fast and hopefully decentralized soon. That's facts - not shills.


&gt; why would I need LTC if I can use xrp and my txs are even cheaper and faster?


Because some people think, you may call it insanity, that the real innovation behind cryptocurrencies is decentralization. If the US wants to shut down Ripple, they can. They cannot shut down Litecoin for that matter. 

&gt; But soon enough even LN will do the same.


Exactly, and LN was first tested and can also be used on ... which currency was it again? Think it was Litecoin? Could be wrong here mate! 



That said, if LN is applied on Litecoin, I'm pretty sure that you won't even be able to claim cheaper and faster transactions in Ripple. 


&gt; And I never said xrp is a cryptocurrency, so what is your point?


First I wanted to say ""good, because they're not"". Then I thought our discussion is going for a while and let's see what I can find regarding your own words. 


&gt;  I sometimes decide to follow the money and meantime, you gotta give respect to the team who is trying to go all mainstream on bringing blockchain and cryptos to banks.


That's what you said. So ripple labs is pushing Cryptocurrencies to the banks? I thought they weren't even a Crypto? Whatever.


&gt; But it is funny, a shitcoin like Ripple is even better than your shitcoin ltc.

I'm not even arguing that. It comes with preferance. If you want cheaper and faster *right now*, then yes, Ripple does better. 


If you value decentralization, a key aspect of Crypto, and you assume that LN is not just a theory, but will eventually work, then you have to give credit to Litecoin also, because it will also be implemented onto their chain. 




Think we can end this here.

However money is usually allocated to where it yields most. I have money in Ripple, despite hating Ripple. I know it will pump, that's why I have some money in it. I have money in IOTA, despite them operating under a centralized coordinator and I'm very cautious and will not take the project serious until they start slowly reducing/deleting the coordinator all together. I know why they currently need such an entitity, but I'm careful until they're dependant on him. And I also have EOS and sell prior to network launch, because I don't want to lose money, because their delegated proof of stake doesn't work in the real world. Because of that I'm in for the hype money and that's good enough.

"&gt; Why bring ripple and what I'm subbed on


Because you called Litecoin a shitcoin. I think that's a funny statement from someone who just hopes for Ripple to pump. 


&gt; And I just checked your comments and you're out there bashing Iota like crazy ON ""GOOD LITECOIN"" news.


I own IOTA and speculate with it like many others. I am skeptical about their project, until they can run without a coordinator. Whether or not I hold them is pretty much irrelevant. 


&gt; Actually, it just seems you care about charlie and you don't really have a problem


No, I just happen to be in Crypto for longer than just December. I know these people and I know Roger is scum and Charlie is simply put amazing for the sphere in general. I don't even own Litecoin myself. 


&gt; As per Ripple I like your 'AFAIK', I sometimes decide to follow the money and meantime, you gotta give respect to the team who is trying to go all mainstream on bringing blockchain and cryptos to banks. I don't see litecoin have a future, sorry if thats against your beliefs.


I own Ripple myself. Because they pump like no other. Are they a cryptocurrency? No, they're centralized garbage. Will they pump again? Yes, that's what I think and it's why I hold them right now? 




Just because you can make money with IOTA and Ripple, doesn't mean I have to talk them to heaven right? They currently pump and yield better than most other coins. That's why I'm currently in. 


And I will dump that shit the second I think the pump is over and transfer the money back into real projects/real cryptocurrencies.",1524397072

"&gt;If that were going to happen though it would start out much smaller, build to a certain point slowly, then explode. Hard to say how close we might be to a build up like that. I expect a scenario like that to play out in a country experiencing hyperinflation or capital controls in the next year.

Zimbabwe has had years where their official currency was demonitized and a large variety of other currencies (mainly the USD but also the GBP, the SAR, the JPY and the EUR) were being used instead, and years before that when it was so hyper-inflated it might as well have been demonitized. There has been years for adoption to take off.

The real concerning thing for the bitcoin community is there is no assumed difference between either possibility. There are people who just assume bitcoin is already in use as currency in places like Zimbabwe and Venezuela because of the constant stream of hype articles, and when they find out its not, they revert from ""bitcoin is  being adopted in Zimbabwe/Venezuela"" to ""its still in development, we still need to wait for Lightning/Segwit/etc before people can start using it as a main currency""

They thought Bitcoin was a viable right now, and then immediately switched to saying its not yet viable, meaning they have no idea what it will take for it to be a viable currency.

There is no serious questioning of what its problems are and what it will take to get adoption, its all just deferred to vague hopes of ""price will stabilize when it hits mass adoption"" and ""bitcoin is still a new technology it still has a lot of improvement to do"".",1524396658

There is absolutely no way major worldwide adoption can happen with such major risks hanging over platforms that will run so many daily functions that people use - any major issue/disagreements/mistake will put the whole system to a halt.

In the end, I can see a somewhat compromise where the system is decentralised as much as possible while maintaining some central control to prevent issues I have stated from affecting systems.",1524396628

"&gt; i really need a relaxing reply to calm my nerves a bit.

Rest assured, this was all fully considered years ago.

Most Bitcoin miners already are on fiber internet and have multimillion dollar investments in capital, a few extra hard drives costs them nothing.

Past that, the vision of the network has always been that end users access the blockchain via SPV, which has negligible network requirements:

http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/bitcointalk/287/

&gt; The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  **The design supports letting users just be users.**  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.",1524395324

Also most of the trading prices are not really tied to the projects themselves, but the community behind. Basically no coin except a handful is usable, and this means price changes are more about how bots exploit the small order books and cheat on volatility.

They're no decentralized, and essentially Bitmain cash. Probably the only reason other BTC pools didn't 51% attack Bcash yet, because Bitmain protection. 


So they're not decentralized, but have cheaper transactions than Bitcoin! That's a plus! Except, it isn't. Many coins in the sphere have much cheaper and faster transactions that BCH offers. 



So they're not decentralized, they're not the cheapest nor the fastest, and the personalities that market the coin are absolute scumbags and sometimes even straight con-artists, when you see people like fake Satoshi.

"Cryptomarket is the next evolution of stock, not long before stock trading will go to become cryptos themselves as the blockchain tech is much better suited then whatever the NASDAQ had been doing for so long. It's old shit, it's Satured and over complicated. The fact that normies can't even directly enter the stock market but have to go through crooked banks or Brookers says enough about the stock market. It won't be long before a big overhaul, which is overdue, is coming to the stock market - and it will be inspired by the cryptomarket.

Secondly, renevue reports works exactly the same as deadline of roadmap achievements for crypto. If people expect it will be good, they buy 1 month to two weeks before it comes out, then sell the day before. It's always have been buy the rumour and sell the news. 

Crypto itself is still in its early stage - though I would call it late early by now, slowly making the transition to mid stage were the kinks have been ironed out and it's truly going mainstream (I believe we are at the edge of it right now). There are very promising things coming. 

Another thing is, crypto is live 24/7 and active globally.  
Also it's easier to buy/sell/tether up in crypto then stocks and it's MUCH cheaper too (my broker asks 7 euros just to buy a German stock for example. It ask 50 cents + 0.01 cent for each stock I buy for American stocks, the sell out he ask the same fucking price!). Because crypto is based on tech and the tech won't die if the original team left (enough projects has gotten new devs, Bitcoin has thousands of different devs that's had worked on it), it's hard to fully kill it off. The only way is if the crypto gets delisted in exchanges. Unlike stocks, even if the devs of Bitcoin stopped, Bitcoin still goes through. It's decentralized and Trustless, it's a system not a company.

The problem is that since cryptos are like companies, the most well organized and talented teams will eventually win.

Look what happened to BTC, it was perfect for 2009 but 9 years later there are cracks everywhere (speed, difficulty creating contracts, lack of privacy features etc).

The only cryptos that I see that have a somewhat well structured team are XRP, ETH and ZEC.

"&gt; USD drops out of the calculation for protecting the network against the only viable / useful attack scenario I've found. So no, I'm not in that case.

Ok, so thats your first assumption. Fair enough, i will let you run with it. Even though, in my opinion, theorising miner behaviour withour taking into account proposed USD value is not a correct assumption. The miners have to buy hardware, pay for energy, and potentially pay employees in USD. The exchange rate directly affects the cost/benefit ratio. We saw this in the Monoro example where the POW was ASIC resistant due to a cost/benefit ratio - once the price of Monero went above a certain **USD** value, it all changed. 

&gt; Miners are financially incentivized to act in the best interest of the network. This is the bedrock foundational principle of Bitcoin and all blockchains. Even proof of stake, DAG's and DPOS blockchains are still founded on this principle. The only blockchains not reliant on this principle are the most obviously centralized.

At the moment, this may be the case. However, we are not talking about at the moment. 

I hypothesised a future where there a collective of collusive miners were able to exist. 

They were able to collude, as collective miner action was profitable. It was profitable as the user base faced a situation the costs of moving to an alternative chain (ie using another coin) were greater than the utility derived from remaining on the chain on which the miners were colluding. That was my attack scenario.

However, if you don't want to talk about that, ok - that's your choice. 

But if you do, let's talk about empirical evidence. We can return to the Monero test case. 

Recently Monero forked as they had miners on their chain who were not acting in the best interests of the community, or the token. Their actions were as follows

* the miners were secretly mining on ASICs, stripping coinbases from CPUs and GPUs as was intended (causing grumbles in the community, with massive mining difficulty

* infecting computers with mining malware (causing bad press in public facing press)

* dumping coins on markets as soon as possible (causing constant downward pressure on price). The last point may not necessarily be seen as bad though, i agree.

The Monero community felt the miner behaviour was not in their interests, and forked a POW change, and have indicated that they will again, when needed. 

So your above point in incorrect.

&gt; Therefore, for an attack involving miner behaviour to be successful, enough miners would need to have a larger incentive to act against this best interest rather than for it. 

Again, the attack i put hypothesise as being possible (the colluding miners attack, creating a fee market) is the one i am suggesting you look at. You haven't, but ok. we move on. 

&gt; An extremely well funded group wishes to attempt to open massive leveraged shorts against Bitcoin and then perform a 51% attack and turn a profit.

This is not at all what i suggested. So you are basically putting forward your explanation for a 51% attack, based on leveraged shorts, along with the corresponding maths.

&gt; This calculation resulted in numbers much higher than I could imagine any government justifying for the cost of an attack. If someone wanted to consider government attacks, they'd have to lay out the scenario so the costs &amp; payoffs would be addressed.

when did yo switch to a government attack? At first it was a well funded group with the attack?

&gt; Why would the miners collude? What is the payoff or benefit for them doing so? What costs or sacrifices do they have to make? This is the information that allows the game theory of the attack - and its defenses - to be worked out. Without them, it's just vague descriptions of boogeymen.

At least you get to the actual point of my question - which you didn't seem to want to answer, so lets step through this slowly. 

&gt; Why would the miners collude? 

Because miner collusion means they can agree on a minimum fee for transaction cost. This increases each and every miners coinbase, and hence, profitability

&gt; What is the payoff or benefit for them doing so? 

See above. 

&gt; What costs or sacrifices do they have to make?

The success/failure of the collusion rests on the delicate ratio of increase in coinbase/reduction in transactions due to increased fees. I am sure you will notice this curve can be drawn in economics terms. 

It also rests on the cohesiveness of the collusion pact, and the availability of new entrants coming in with enough hash rate to solve blocks (however, if you talk about this, then address the ASIC manufacturing and distribution issue please, thanks).

You should also be asking what assumptions i am putting this attack vector on. I described that above, but can repeat again. 

**They were able to collude, as collective miner action was profitable. It was profitable as the user base faced a situation the costs of moving to an alternative chain (ie using another coin) were greater than the utility derived from remaining on the chain on which the miners were colluding.**

&gt; Did you mean something else? Get specific please, ""collusion"" is meaningless without discussing the intents / payoffs / costs of the collusion.

Don't insult my intelligence, or waste my time, please. 

I specifically pointed to a collusion attack vector, describing it intentionally about two posts above from yours. I have also described it twice now in this post.

Blockchain seems to be the answer this industry has been searching for and the traction they are getting might help them implement it. My major concern is how pricing would work as photographers are not exactly crypto savvy and from my experience, hesitant when it comes to a new agency. 

I have to ask though - how did a blockchain venture sign all of these advisors? The background of this team is ridiculously impressive.

"Here are three statements from the article:

1. ""Out of these 32 ventures not a single company was licensed to sell securities in the state.""
2. ""These fraud schemes use coins and tokens to refer to digital assets, however, in compliance with the US law tokens are considered as securities.""
3. ""However, there are many inherent risks of cryptocurrencies such as lack of regulatory framework nationally and internationally.""

If #3 is correct, then #2 is incorrect and therefore #1 is not a statement of wrong doing. 

The SEC and state securities regulators, against the recommendation of the U.S. Senate, have declared all cryptos to be securities because they want them to be, not because they are. They think if they repeat the lie often enough, people will believe it and it's working. 

Yes, there are fraudulent crypto projects but there are adequate laws to handle fraud without having to involve securities agencies.  If you buy an oil painting (which can be for investment purposes) and you discover it's a fake, do you call the SEC? If you buy a collectible coin in a shop and then discover it's counterfeit, do you call the SEC? If you don't get a commission check from a multi level marketing operation for what you sold, do you call the SEC?  If you buy a book of ferry tickets for the season and the ferry company tells you they expired mid-season, do you call the SEC?  Tokens and coins have just as much in common with this examples as they do with traditional securities, maybe more.  

Securities laws date from the 1940's and they are not suitable for cryptocurrencies.  That is why Federal law makers have deferred making a judgment as to their applicability to cryptos.  Meanwhile, they don't want to drive innovation and opportunity out of the U.S.  The SEC and state securities agencies don't care.  They only care about exerting their rule over the industry and protecting the legacy system that employs them.  

It would be nice if the authors of all these articles about 'securities violations' would be balanced and disclose the fact that #3 above is the true status of regulation, not #2.  ",1524382745

"What do you guys think about this [comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8801tu/daily_discussion_march_29_2018/dwi16yw/). I'll just quote it below:

&gt; History has shown that once an asset class bubble bursts, it never recovers to become a bubble again ‚Äîthere are rarely any ""second chances"", if any at all.
&gt; 
&gt; Paradoxically, a volatile and rapid appreciation of a currency, is a failed currency. By definition, currencies are supposed to be recognized, accepted and stable mediums of exchange for goods and services ‚Äînot just another speculative boom-bust asset class driven by speculative mania like art.
&gt; 
&gt; Cryptocurrencies can only be considered for adoption once corporations, governments and charities deem the asset class as stable. However, speculators and traders desire anything but stability and thrive on the volatility of 10% intraday price swings ‚Äîthe demographic here are experienced pre-millennial traders from other asset classes, whom quite frankly are careless in regards to the future of cryptocurrencies. So, the demographic 'invested' in cryptocurrencies are the millennials whom have a pseudo-understanding of cryptography and blockchain given their affinity to technology; but with a lack of trading experience and anti-establishment views, they simply adopt a unidirectional mentality, i.e. 'hodl', in the vein that prices will perpetually rocket to the moon.
&gt; 
&gt; Its a classic case of where the millennials know the price of everything, but the value of nothing. Real-world intrinsic value will be set by the 'whale' pre-millennials.
&gt; 
&gt; So who actually has any altruistic concern about the future of cryptocurrencies? Nobody. Hence, the bubble bursts. The ALT/BTC tokens are the epitome of manipulation and fraud.
&gt; 
&gt; Cryptocurrencies are a speculative side implementation of legitimate blockchain technology. Use of blockchain such as distributed ledgers for say the Asset Servicing areas of investment banking are genuine solutions. Once legitimate uses of blockchain are adopted as real-world applications, its then likely a second generation of cryptocurrencies may emerge as stable alternatives to fiat with greater adoption.
&gt; 
&gt; Quite possible that the likes of Google, Microsoft and Amazon lead the way with the next generation cryptocurrencies by acquiring the current players. In comparison to a mobile farm in rural China, cloud mining with say Microsoft's Azure decentralised platform with their vast, secure and robust datacentres is most technically feasible and trustworthy.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄîIf the costs of mining begin to outweigh, then Bitcoin could cease to exist along with the current generation of other cryptocurrencies.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄîNot all speculative asset classes have survived their respective bubble bursts, especially non-tangible ones.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄîTechnology, algorithms, software &amp; hardware are short-cycle lifespan industries, subjected to rapid price depreciation and obsolescence. 
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄîIf Bitcoin does survive, price volatility would have to subside for adoption, and it must begin to behave like a stable currency as opposed to boom-bust cycles akin to a speculative asset class. Therefore, its success as a currency and survival would be paradoxically tied to no further parabolic price appreciation curves. 
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄîCicso, the darling of dotcom stocks, the backbone of the Internet, has yet to recover from its parabolic price collapse 20 years on; chart: https://i.imgur.com/zA1L0pz.png
&gt; 
&gt; Since inception, the price of Bitcoin and mining complexity have been been parabolically twined. 
&gt; However, since late Dec 2017, price has more than halved whilst the difficulty of mining remains increasingly complex.
&gt; Is this divergence between price/complexity sustainable economics, whether altruistic in pursuit or incentivised?
&gt; In other words, would you work harder and for longer whilst your salary decreased? Ask the Virginia coal miners.
&gt; 
&gt; Price: https://i.imgur.com/dkb0Reh.png
&gt;  
&gt; Difficulty: https://i.imgur.com/52I6yOz.png
&gt; 
&gt; Historically, when any asset bubble bursts, the unravelling bear market typically lasts 2 years on average (from peak price to ultimate low); and usually erases approx 90% in value (thebubblebubble.com/historic-crashes).
&gt; 
&gt; Applying the metrics to the cryptocurrency bubble, it would suggest Bitcoin between $850 and $2500 around 2Q2019.

"&gt; concerned

""Concerned"" ? We hear you.

FYI ""concern troll"" is also a kind of troll.

&gt; No. We can't scale to worldwide money with this kind of attitude. Faster? Faster compared to what? Tell me.

You don't know what you are talking about because you weren't here when the ORIGINAL ""fee market"" existed.

It has nothing to do with the current definition of fee market.

At the end of 2014 up to beginning of 2015 you could pay NO FEE AT ALL and get your transaction into block. Of course this would take longer time than normal tx-fee paying transaction, but it would get there and it was certain.

Then came Bitcoin Core and broke it.",1524382574
"You seem to be quite new into the bitcoin space, and some answers haven't been to clear. I'd like to clarify some stuff.

- If only your friend had the private key to those 100 bitcoin, those bitcoin are exactly where they've been for years. No one has touched them, and if your friend doesn't move them, they'll stay there forever.

- If the guy that gave them to your friend kept a copy of the private key, he can move them.

- You'll always be able to deal with the bitcoin as a solo owner of the private key. There's no platform to ""delete your account"" for lack of use or anything. They're there.

- We're talking a million dollars. The guy's a f legend for making a passive search.

Good luck!",1524382556
"When you buy your gold though, as in a physical bar of the different sizes available, how do you know that it is a real gold bar.????
Think I read that even jewellers have received officially stamped gold bars that have been fakes and not gold at all.

BTC can‚Äôt be faked, BTC is in that case better and safer than Gold period.",1524382556
"Bitcoin's main value is storing value securely and cheaply. Conventional assets actually have a considerable amount of cost when storing them securely for a long time. Bitcoin has very low cost for storage, especially at large values.

Bitcoin's transfer characteristics are valueable but less so. We already have Paypal. What does Bitcoin do more than that? Its censorship resistant to a degree.

Now if you want to be a sucker put in more than you can handle losing and expect it not to fluctuate massively short term. The suckers at the people who think they ll get massive short term gains and freak out and sell when they are 50% down a month or two after investing.",1524382337

sorry, I reread my wording, and it is indeed awful.

let me try again.

we started with the premise of TB-sized blocks, which presumes some massive, worldwide tsunami of adoption that would dwarf anything the world has seen

from this assumption you conclude that Bitcoin will fail

therefore, ""everyone using Bitcoin"" = failure

it's a poison-pill ideology.  Keep it in BTC, it has no place in BCH.

Those two things were enough to alienate my (financially poor) family, and enough for them to ask a lot of questions.
