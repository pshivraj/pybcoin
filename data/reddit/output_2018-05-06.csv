"Bitcoin has never recovered this slowly in history, ever. 

You can make these case that it's currently worse than MtGox years. 


That's because vast sums of money are currently allocated into scam projects, that don't bring Crypto any further whatsoever. 


Essentially Bitcoin dominance metric is useful, in that it shows how much crazy money exists in the market. 

Every single shitcoin without exception is currently overvalued. And with Shitcoin I mean the vast majority of coins besides Bitcoin. Besides Litecoin, Monero and maybe Ethereum, every single project currently is heavily overvalued. Espcially the sunshine and promise ICOs currently in top10, without any use whatsoever. 

Dire, dire market state. 


What do you honestly expect to happen? 


There's really two different scenarios.


1) We dip again, and the money gets flushed from Alts. 

2) We stagnate and they explode one after another. 


You're an absolute moron if you think Cryptocurrency and its market dynamics stayed the same, ever since ERC20 creation. 


Nothing significantly bad has happend the past month or even two, yet here we are, still with red faces. 


That's because Bitcoin is unable to push to new highs, making Crypto less and less interesting for new people. 


People start to see, that's no longer free and easy money. Which is true. 


New people entering the scene with their couple dollar, buy trash like Vechain and Request Network, instead of actually holding skin in projects that have real value. 


If you want your money safe, in the current market, you hedge to Fiat or you allocate your money to safe projects, the one where you will bleed the least is obviously Bitcoin. It also happens to be the most used project by far, so you would do something healthy for Crypto and contribute, by moving the market in a rational direction. 


Ultimately this Reddit post means nothing. Money will be list and we are likely to stagnate/dip again, because these shitcoins are still massively overvalued, give nthe fact most of them are useless as of right now.

That case, where Crypto can only increase over time, worked in the past, because whilst Bitcoin was being speculated with, it is also used. And it is also decentralized and what we wished for. It's the main innovation in Cryptocurrency still. 


*It's Blockchain, then Bitcoin* 


No, it's fucking Bitcoin, then whatever rainbow you want to snort.

The paper doesn’t really cover minority forks, expecting them to resolve as miners converge on the chain with the greatest PoW. I don’t think Satoshi considered the need to state that a minority fork with minority hashrate and different rules isn’t Bitcoin, it’s not exactly an economically rational action in the long term to diverge from the money that everyone else is using if you don’t have direct control over the monetary policy.  Think about that for a while and you might find some possibilities of the reasoning for certain entities to support BCH, just a thought...",1525674764

"How, specifically, have those seriously large amounts been lost? 

The same private key that controls a BTC wallet also controls the BCH wallet and vice versa. If someone mistakenly sends the wrong currency, it can easily be retrieved and has been in the cases I'm aware of. Besides, BCH now uses a different address format, so this scenario won't even happen anymore.

If someone mistakenly bought BCH instead of BTC, they would have gained more throughout most of BCH's history. They can flip it back to BTC and have more BTC than if they had bought BTC directly. Nothing lost, gained instead.

"it's not supposed to be 'make you rich hodl til moon/lambo' deflationary, it's supposed to be slow predictable deflationary, as one might hope for with stable steady adoption with no speculation.  of course what we actually have is mostly rampant speculation; which makes it highly deflationary; which makes people unlikely to spend it - the entire point of having a currency and in making a new fully reserved currency to compete with the fractional system.

note a deflationary spiral was a problem during the depression as well - people wouldn't spent, business activity would not occur, gdp would shrink.

part of the reason i like the BCH community is that the BTC community seems full of much more ""investors"" who for all intents and purposes simply treat BTC as if it really is a ponzi.  it should go up in value, as it is adopted, but it's point is to outcompete fractional government fiat - not make you rich.  i like that BCH is more focused on adoption vs. BTC being more focused on HODL.",1525674233
"I agree that nothing should be etched in stone. But at the same time you can not reference one part of the WP and then ignore the other when it no longer fits your definition.  So either we can use the WP as ""Gospel"" and use the quote given or we can make up our own definitions. In the case of the later we have to accept that other people will see it differently as there is no longer a text book definition of what is and isn't. That then comes to the realm of what ""feels"" right which as we all know is not scientific. Which is why I choose the middle ground of everything is bitcoin that starts from the genesis block and in my opinion BCH is the ""better"" bitcoin. I disagree when bch supporters say bch is the REAL bitcoin. But at the same time think btc supporters do not have a leg to stand on when they say bch isnt bitcoin. 

If BTC somehow managed to reach ""community consensus"" and fork to 1 min blocks I would wonder what all the bullshit about the size increase was.. but to your point if it then overtook as the longest chain I would say that yes it is indeed the dominant chain. But I would not change my stance that there is more than one flavor of bitcoin. We have different opinions on I think there is a dominant chain and you think there can be only chain called bitcoin.

"saturday i'm flying in a $15k one way cathay pacific first class suite.  i paid about $80 and some AA frequent flyer miles that were not all that challenging to earn.  i think BTCs claim of digital gold/store of value only or first for a long doesn't make a lot of sense, where i think they are particularly wrong i think is saying it's for larger transactions and not coffee shops.  but coffee shops are easy, simple, riskless, meaningless daily transactions and among the easiest to adopt.  foregoing of any credit card protection or any mileage is most easily done at that level.

people will use cc's for 1% cash back, or a point worth a penny; which just comes out of the processor/bank's 3% or so fees.  i think crypto's win is in discounting the crypto price from cc.  i believe part of the card processing agreement is you cannot offer a cash discount (done in many countries around the world of course - or they just add the processing fee to your bill) - since crypto is volatile though i would think it's way easier to go ahead and get away with something like this.  instead of visa taking 3%, merchant keeps 1.5% and you keep 1.5% - their profit margin is up, and you got more cash than you would have points or USD cash back.",1525673961

Nah it is the best UX you can currently find for crypto. ,1525673584
"if you are in a western society your need for crypto is simply not nearly as strong as elsewhere.

it absolutely must be quick, easy, and cheap to compete - but the current banking system is already competing and trying to improve as well.  what is your case to her really?  what bitcoin is really about is being analogous to gold as money - it's fully reserved banking.  libertarians and some others have been in the US for decades proposing various fiat or gold fully reserved banking solutions, and gotten little traction outside of their circles.  the reality is they do not feel the pain of the currency slips, as gold went from 100% to 0% backing of the dollar.  the state enjoys this as well as it allows them to more easily fund wars and more easily intervene in the economy, and oops make mistakes - like cheap money available for too long fueling a housing bubble - but how many of your average citizens are really aware of this and understand how an alternate system of banking would make more difficult?  your friend just wants to pay for her meal.

so i think in the west, it's libertarian geeks who care about this who will push adoption, and perhaps merchants willing to split the credit card fee between themselves and the customer so that a discount is offered to encourage payment in crypto.

contrast this with money movement to other countries or mismanagement of currency/shitty governments.  remittances sent to mexico or the philippines can more cheaply be done with crypto, full stop.  government imposed currency controls can be escaped and capital can be transferred from one country to another.  rural africa where no banking will be built for people who live on $2 a day can have access to mobile savings.  mismanaged currencies like those in venezuela or argentina can be escaped today, into what should be a store of value as a feature of being a currency, but i would also even consider it an edge case where 'store of value only' digital gold might make a little economic sense, vs. the nonsense i typically think of that claim.

tl; dr:

crypto is a more important tool and an easier thing to adopt when you live under a problematic state.

in a western developed state it's adoption will have to primarily come from merchant adoption based on financial incentives, as libertarians have shown that very little traction can be made trying to educate people on fractional reserve banking and convince them into supporting fully reserved banking.",1525673581

"&gt; True, but so is gold's value.

not really.  gold is a hardcore store of value deeply embedded into the monetary system and functioning essentially as insurance.  old wall street advice used to be to keep x% of it in your portfolio but hope it did nothing - which meant stocks were doing ok.  it was essentially acting as cash or bonds/tips in a portfolio today, because back then, that's basically what it was.  it was there to protect and preserve purchasing power, not gain any.  note this is the opposite of how most people treat bitcoin even if they do claim it is a digital gold store of value - they are expecting it to make them rich, they are not even treating it like a store of value, which has the intent of preservation only.

in any case the gold market is bouncing around with speculation and organic demand just like any market - but much of it is deployed organically for the historic/cultural/monetary reasons, it's not a market of primary speculation like crypto; it's a market of primary use just like USD or EUR.  that use is as insurance or currency of last resort.

do note the argentine central bank last week sold 5 billion USD to purchase and try to prop up their peso.  if they run out of USD, what do they use?  gold, the ultimate currency.

&gt; Yeah, but once inflation starts skyrocketing it's gonna be too late to rescue the value.

the US has not had truly problematic inflation for some time, which was put to rest by the volcker fed.  i don't see any reason to expect in in a bad way in the near future nor does high-er inflation necessarily mean it's inflation that can't be dealt with or contained; ie. even double digit genies can be put back in the bottle, beyond that, not so easy though.

the claims the USD is on the brink of collapse are wildly exaggerated, doing even the most basic research on a currency that has actually collapsed will lead one to see the many apples/oranges comparisons that people who claim this are ignoring.",1525671248

People using the app for Bitcoin-BTC should be as happy as people using the app for Bitcoin-BCH ... and then when the fees go up they will probably automatically stop using Bitcoin-BTC anyways.

Waiting for the other chain to get longer is pointless, it will never happen. Even if BCH becomes completely worthless all it will take is a single CPU miner to keep extending it, BTC will never catch up in block count. That’s an incredibly poor metric to use, but to each their own, I suppose.

"Thank you for the straightforward and explanation of your definition of what you consider to be bitcoin.  Satoshi's "" longest proof-of-work chain"" definition has been somewhat muddled given the start of bch had the mad swings in miner activity giving it the ""longest"" chain while btc maintains the most ""proof of work"". As you said miners will mine whatever makes the most money which is how bitcoin was designed to work. Which in my opinion makes which metric you look at a mater of interpretation. Which is why in my opinion until one coin is able to claim both metrics neither will be the ""dominant"" chain. That being said as long as anyone is mining any fork they are also a version of bitcoin. We will have to just disagree about the definition. There is no longer 1 bitcoin. There is also no longer 1 dominant chain. BTC is unarguably the leader in POW. BCH has the longest chain though I am sure you will disagree with the validity of it. One will eventually claim both. I agree with you that at the end the chain with the most activity will win. I see more potential for that on the BCH chain but only time will tell.

First I was hoping that the NYA would solve the problem for a while. I've always been a big blocker, but I was pretty moderate, not wanting to split the network. In October the whole NO2X nonsense made me reevaluate. The vitriol from that camp made me realize the Bitcoin community is actually deeply divided and that I did not want to associate with people like that, ever.

I still had all my BCH from the split and I decided to sell the majority of my BTC at ~0.06. This has been a pretty good decision for me and I do not regret it in the slightest. I've kept a few Bitcoin and Ethereum that earn money from an investment for me. I use the proceeds from that to automatically buy BCH, so I am buying BCH every day. The only sad thing for me is that I now get less BCH every day :D

This is a slight exaggeration on my part, but if Coinbase decides it might be liable for money laundering because they facilitated a transfer, they would be wise to refuse.

If for example you were sending USD to a known terrorist private bank account, yes. Same concept applies to crypto.

If you do it wallet-to-wallet, no the government may not know, but if you're going through a 3rd party (i.e. an exchange), they're going to care.

&gt;Plenty of exchanges don't KYC, and there's plenty of non-exchange methods to change BTC to ETH, such as Shapeshift.

KYC is just a process. You can KYC with fancy tech and all that, but most of the time exchanges just require a passport. They don't need extensive KYC to know you're an American. Many financial services across the world will flat out refuse service to Americans.

GDAX/Coinbase, for example, refused to open an account for an American friend of mine in Singapore. He found a way around it, but technically, the fact that GDAX opened an account and allowed him to trade ETH through it is illegal. The Monetary Authority in Singapore could shut them down or kick them out of the country for that.",1525668644

"Bitcoin is the chain with the most PoW that started with Satoshi’s genesis block. That’s Bitcoin.

If Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin Pizza overtakes that in a decisive fashion, it’s now Bitcoin.  I suspect that’s unlikely.   But there’s only one chain that is Bitcoin.  If I fork and create my own coin, it’s not Bitcoin either.

That’s why I thought UASF was stupid(SegWit2x got us SegWit, not UASF, we should have done both at the same time cause we got burned on the minimal blocksize increase), it’s why I think all the bitcoin.com drama labeling BCH as Bitcoin is stupid, and it’s why I think forks with obvious lack of majority support like Bitcoin Pizza or Bitcoin Cash are stupid.

Right now hashpower is just following the price and bouncing back and forth between BCH/BTC based on whatever is most profitable. At the end of the day the chain with the most economic activity is going to win, because it will get the most security. I suspect that LN is going to hand that activity to BTC, and BCH will die a centralized death if it ever sees any real volume since it will be expensive to run a node at 32MB blocks in the near future. A centralized blockchain is just a really inefficient database and no longer interesting. If BCH never gets the economic volume, it will just die due to lack of transaction fees to incentivize miners as the reward keeps halving. 

Either way, I’m fairly sure that BCH is fucked in the long run.

I do think that we will eventually have 32MB and larger blocks on Bitcoin(I’d guess in the next 10 years), but that needs to be balanced with advancements in bandwidth, since that’s the true limitation, not disk space as so many useful idiots like to ramble on about around here. ",1525665640
Their game? Cryptocurrency is the future. Bitcoin is allready a worldcurrency and more will come.,1525665625
"Cryptomining is pretty complicated, with a lot of new concept to learn. Especially for new people just starting out.

 I get the strong impression that the writer is not 100% read up on how mining works, and should probably have done more research before publishing this. I found it very confusing, with parts that bring nothing but more questions and doubt. A few examples:

&gt;ASIC GPUs produced by Bitmain

An ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) is not a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit). They are very different, and calling them both GPUs is confusing.

&gt;As we’ve seen with the bitcoin network, ASIC miners control about 38% (https://blockchain.info/pools) of the bitcoin mining network, which starts to centralize the network into the hands of the miners.

There is so much wrong in this quote. 

First, that link just shows the hashrate distribution for BTC pools, not that ""ASIC miners control about 38% of the bitcoin mining network"". Second, where does the 38% number come from and what does it refer to? That AntPool and BTC.com has about 38% of the hashpower? Anyone can mine to those pools with any hardware, just as Bitmain can point their farms to any other pool to hide their hashrates. Why even bring that up?

And  what is meant by ""ASIC miners"" here? I'd be utterly shocked if only 38% of the hashpower for BTC comes from ASICs, it's probably closer to 99% and has been for a long time. 

&gt; With the introduction of these new E3 miners, the network could potentially see a 51% attack if all mining is controlled by these new chips. 

Only if the pool(s) said ASICs mine to participate in the attack, and at that point only hashpower matters not what hardware it comes from, be it ASICs or GPUs. So nothing would change on that front from today, even if the network was 90% E3s. And even today individual miners have the responsibility to make their choice of pool carefully, to avoid unknowingly participating in such a 51% attack.

And even if you had, you're still part of what is evidently a small minority - this is not merely on Reddit by the way. However, while on Reddit, things get downvoted based on merit; choosing to downvote a post into oblivion isn't a circle-jerk, or being against free speech... it's expressing one's opinion, which ultimately adds up.

Shows like Silicon Valley and Westworld are huge on Reddit, as well as in popular culture. They are critically acclaimed and highly rated for a reason. You can sure as hell dislike them (though I believe it's unfair to do so without properly viewing something in its entirety), but if you voice your opinion and get rekt by downvotes, it doesn't mean you should cry about something being a merit-less circle-jerk.

"I think what he is referencing is whether there any *current* use cases that using bitcoin instead of traditional banks provides a tangible benefit over the traditional methods of payment. Either a benefit of: convenience, savings, or some other unknown. The answer is not really but kind of. 

Correct me if I’m wrong, but currently, the big argument is sending money internationally for a low fee. When you factor in exchange fees, and the time/labor required for a person to deal with exchanges and send the money, there’s a small monetary benefit for some transfers. Likely larger transfers or ones where there are no labor costs (personal). Even then, everyday people right now would rather pay a little more for it to be a lot easier than figuring out how to send bitcoin. 

The other big use case is buying drugs/services on the dark web. This is a very real use case that it’s getting used for currently. 

There are lots of potential use cases out there- getting away from the centralized banking system, sending money anywhere for next to nothing (if you can buy a bunch of goods for bitcoin), but currently there’s not a ton of benefit that it offers over the traditional system. Why would a person want to pay with bitcoin right now over fiat (other than to try to make their investment worth more through “adoption”)?",1525663625

## What is a 'Derivative'

A derivative is a financial [security](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp) with a value that is reliant upon or derived from an underlying asset or group of assets. The derivative itself is a contract between two or more parties based upon the asset or assets. Its price is determined by fluctuations in the [underlying asset](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underlying-asset.asp). The most common underlying assets include stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, \(insert Bitcoin here\), interest rates and market indexes.

Ether is to be treated as ""crypto\-fuel"", a token whose purpose is to pay for computation, and is not intended to be used as or considered a currency, asset, share or anything else.There are many ways in which you can use Bitcoins within the Ethereum ecosystem:

* **Trade BTC for ETH:** multiple third\-party companies are working to make the exchanging of ether and bitcoins as easy and seamless as possible. If so desired one could trade bitcoins for ether with the purpose of executing contracts and trade it back immediately in order to keep their value pegged and secured by the bitcoin network. The latest version of the wallet includes an automatic conversion between ether and bitcoin.
* **Use a pegged derivative:** Ethereum is a great tool for creating complex trading between multiple parties. If you have a source for the price of Bitcoin that all parties trust, then it's possible to create an [ethereum based currency](https://www.ethereum.org/token) whose value is pegged to the market value of Bitcoin. This means that you could trade bitcoins to a token that is guaranteed to always trade back to the same amount of bitcoins while still being fully compatible with other ethereum contracts",1525662703

"Exchanges like Coinbase are required to collect that sort of information for KYC (know your customer) and AML (anti money laundering) regulations.

Coinbase is a good starting point for purchasing your first crypto currency because they're easy to use, but make sure to understand my next point.

Custodial wallets, which is to say a service (like Coinbase) that holds your Bitcoin ""for you"" is very convenient to use because you don't have to worry about losing your wallet, forgetting a password, or any such nonsense.  Plus, you can usually access them directly in a browser.  *But there is a danger!* Since these services have control of your private keys, you don't technically own the Bitcoin, you're trusting them to give it to you when you ask for it.  If Coinbase announced it was going out of business tomorrow, were hacked, or any number of other catastrophes happened, you lose the Bitcoin you had stored with them for good.  Look up MtGox to read up on how this happened in the past.

The best thing you can do is purchase your crypto through an exchange, or another service like localbitcoins, and transfer it to a wallet you've set up on your own PC or phone.  I'd recommend Electrum for PC and Samourai for Android.  I don't have iOS, but I think the most popular one for them is Green wallet, or something along those lines.

## What is a 'Derivative'

A derivative is a financial [security](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp) with a value that is reliant upon or derived from an underlying asset or group of assets. The derivative itself is a contract between two or more parties based upon the asset or assets. Its price is determined by fluctuations in the [underlying asset](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underlying-asset.asp). The most common underlying assets include stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, \(insert Bitcoin here\), interest rates and market indexes.

Well, I agree it should be cheaper, but that is the typical price right now because they are expensive and risky.


The machines themselves have a cost.

Accepting cash is risky, and dealing with it challenging. You realize you cant just go deposit it in a bank right ? You have to pay someone to empty out the machine, and you have to find a way to get it on an exchange to replenish the bitcoin you sell. There is also the risk of stealing, theft, loss etc, because a box full of cash attracts thieves.

Next you have various legal compliance issues, reports to follow, lawyers to pay. So you pass all these cost on in the form of higher prices.

If you can get your state to deregulate them, it will be cheaper. If you can get a bank to take large cash deposits it will be even cheaper. Both of these are impossible right now, so its high overhead whenever cash and USD are involved.

"It could be convenient for governments to detach themselves of the production and control of money. Most of the times they're engaging in massive loans, economic adjustments, and always are at loss and at mercy of bank and industrial lobbying. Also they're competing against other currencies, which leaves them vulnerable to crisis if people start moving money away from the country.

Banks will also lose part of their power because there will be no need for most individuals to use bank services. (they will have to go back to the business of lending money or protecting assets for big companies or wealthy people).

Look at the world debt clocks (http://www.usdebtclock.org/world-debt-clock.html), and notice that most countries have the capacity to repay their debt, except for USA, Japan, Greece, Belgium, Portugal and Spain, but Japan is embracing cryptocurrencies (that could mean that they already want to detach from the regulation of the economy).

The problem is that embracing crypto completely, is that implies a huge shift in the way we use money and produce stuff. And that means that the choices of what you're buying should be more conscious and oriented to preserve your wealth on the long term, more than 'luxury' shopping or buying just because there's a sale, since you can't buy things with credit, and poverty under bitcoin will be brutal if there aren't enough jobs or good social security programs. So: No lambos, but better and cheaper cars probably.",1525660083

Great silicon valley team behind it too.  But they're just stepping stones to something much, much grander...

Eventually, we'll likely all be thinking in terms of bits and there will be no need to use fiat on/off ramps or worry about loans - you'll simply crowdfund everything through social capital linked to things like global identity web of trust networks built on tech like blockstack.

The concept of ownership is going to change; the idea of being stuck in the same house or job for twenty years or being tied to material objects will become rather passé for a globally hyper connected generation able to work from anywhere.  People will be free to explore the world, and, later explore inner and outer space.  

The sharing economy will be the backbone of all this.  Using a car, boat or vacant airbnb won't require anything but a smartphone swipe (or facial recognition gesture linked to your Global Blockstack ID).  It would automatically ratify your trust rank, driving credentials etc.

Your friends will all be on a Google map, you'll be able to see them in real-time and, with little to no emphasis on work and timetables, life will become much more fluid; multiple serendipitous moments will be engineered as your friends come and go freely.  You'll meet strangers this way too of course.

That future is a way off (a decade maybe), it comes through lightning and decentralised exchanges, sidechains and a very, very gradual process that will see the internet and then real world retail outlets using dual pricing on items for sale.  

Sounds crazy, but then the internet's only been here a few decades, and smartphones are less than one decade old.

https://yeenot.today/catalog/news/195

in short:
close contact with the AFM (Authority Financial Markets) and DNB (The Dutch Central Bank) to anticipate any changes related to the upcoming regulations.
ARK shares our vision of making blockchain and thereby cryptocurrencies accessible for everyone.
ARK is working on ACES, which is a community project that is creating cross-chain operability protocols. This means that you will be able to transfer value across different blockchains. 
The ACES project could provide us with the ability to react to transactions on a variety of blockchains by exposing an API that allows us to efficiently listen to (transaction) events. 
Although Blockport is based in Amsterdam, cryptocurrencies are cross-border and so are we. This means that we first start with focusing on the European market since there is less competition and the European market needs a proper Euro-to-crypto exchange.
Also, we are most familiar with the regulatory environment in Europe. After we have established ourselves in the European market, we will be targeting other parts of the world as well. We have a lot of people from the U.S. and Asia in our community, and we see a huge demand coming from those parts of the world as well.

"&gt; Running something more toward the original

The original implementation of Satoshi's bitcoin client intentionally permitted transaction replacement even without payment of a higher fee.

&gt; you won't do a perfect job preventing double spends,

The bitcoin protocol has, so far, successfully and consistently solved double spends - every coin spent in transactions sufficiently confirmed on-chain can be agreed to have been spent to a specific output. To achieve this level of reliability, however, requires confirmation. 0-conf transactions once confirmed will ultimately result in a single spend as well. It is only the victim accepting payment without waiting for the system to sufficiently confirm a transaction who is fooled.",1525659199

"Since BCH has committed to scaling on chain, and the BTC side is way more motivated to research all the layer 2 solutions (since they are committed to not scaling on chain and the absolute destiny of BTC relies on off-chain scaling) I think it's more likely that something may come out of the BTC side and BCH can just adopt it if it actually works.",1525659053
Yes so why would you spend crypto instead of cash ?,1525659046
"Please know all this about lightning before getting too excited 

Essentially, lightning only works as a scaling solution when everyone is already using it. It has no way to bridge the gap from no users(where it is starting) to everyone worldwide using it.

If the node you are trying to pay is offline, you simply can't pay. And you still incur fees when you settle your channels on the restricted blocksize chain.

Worse, it has numerous tradeoffs that will discourage the average person from using it. This amplifies the downsides that arise from it not being universally in use instantly, and will prevent it from ever reaching that state. Here are those:

1. You must be online all the time to be paid. And the person you want to pay must be online for you to pay them.

2. If you go offline at the wrong time and aren't using a centralized hub, you can lose money you didn't even knowingly transact with.

3. The solution to #2 is to enlist ""watchers"" to prevent you from losing money. More overhead the average person isn't going to care about or understand, and more fees that have to be paid. Or people will just be forced to use centralized hubs.

4. Two new users to Lightning will not be able to actually pay eachother without using a centralized hub because no one will lock up funds into the opposing side of their channels; No funded channels = can't pay eachother. Hence... Hubs.

5. Using hubs will come with monthly fee; They aren't going to lock up their capital on your behalf for no cost.

6. The entire system is vulnerable to a mass-default attack. Hubs are especially vulnerable.

7. Lightning will not be able to route large payments(no route available).

8. Lightning transactions are larger than normal transactions.

9. Lightning nodes must keep track of the full history of channel states themselves. If they lose this, they are vulnerable to attacks and may lose coins.

10. Attackers may randomly lock up funds anywhere along the chain of channels for extended periods of time(many hours) at no cost to themselves.

11. The network randomly may fail to work for a user under certain circumstances for no discernable reason as far as they can see (no route available). 


And the issues directly related to the not having everyone on the planet on lightning at first:

1. Small payments consolidating into larger ones, such as a retailer who needs to pay vendors, will fail to route on Lightning, and the loop between the source of the payments(end users) and their destinations(retailers) is broken. This means every channel will ""flow"" in one direction, and need to be refilled to resume actually being used.

2. Refilling every channel will be at least one onchain transaction, possibly two. If this happens twice a month, 1mb blocks + segwit will only be able to serve 4 million users. Some estimates are that Bitcoin already has 2-3 million users.

3. Regardless of lightning's offchain use, Bitcoin must still have enough transaction fees to provide for its network security. Except instead of that minimum fee level being shouldered by 1000 - 500000 million transactions, it is only shouldered by ~170 million transactions with segwit 1mb blocks.
That situation doesn't exist in a vacuum. Users will have a choice - They can go through all that, deal with all of those limitations, odd failures &amp; risks and pay the incredibly high fees for getting on lightning in the first place... Or they can just buy Ethereum, use a SPV wallet, and have payments confirmed in 15 seconds for a fraction of the fees. Or roughly the same choice for SPV+BCH.

The choice will be obvious.

My (and many others) opinion is that lighting is not near as good as people think it will be... It just isn't a scaling solution. Lightning is fine for use cases that need to do frequent, small, or predictable payments with few entities. For example, mining pools paying PPLNS miners. Or gamblers making small bets on gambling sites. Or traders making frequent trades on exchanges.

But as a general purpose scaling solution for average people? It sucks, and they are absolutely not going to go through all of that shit just to use crypto, especially not with better, cheaper, more reliable options out there.",1525659032
I can agree with that.  The problem is getting people to use a crypto until it loses its volatility.  They could do what India did and make their old currency worthless if you did not turn it in for the new currency. Now they have banned or are about to ban the banks from doing any transactions for crypto so a lot of cryptos are being purchased before the door shuts.  I think this is a good idea if they can pull it off.  I just see the banks fighting it like they may be doing now. All of a sudden the SEC wants to declare cryptos as securities.  ,1525658990

"Wow, shocked that AMB was mentioned in this thread. AMB is one of the best projects in crypto. Unbelievably undervalued. They just hired the CMO of Versace and once everyone starts to realize that you can potentially make upwards of six figures in passive income with an Atlas masternode, the project is going to rocket. The fact that very few even know about AMB and their masternodes is a testament to how little hype the project has.",1525658463
"I agree with the other poster who said bitcoin is unlikely to completely replace federal cash, though I do think it will give people a better alternative (and I don't think any government can really stop it). Regarding crypto loans, you can actually get those. Look up bitcoin microlending. You sign a contract saying that you'll receive some amount of bitcoins and are legally obligated to pay it back on a certain schedule with interest, and boom, you just entered a bitcoin loan contact. Such contracts are enforced the same way other contracts are -- through the courts. The current bitcoin microlending services will eventually turn into larger services of bitcoin takes over.

Regarding the guy who asked what would happen in a bitcoin economy if there was an economic crash and the government couldn't print money to get out of it -- it is questionable whether printing money is any kind of solution to an economic crash in the first place. In the second place, it is questionable whether it is the government's job to manage the economy. And in the third place, inflation may be a form of theft, and if so, it should never be done, not even if it would make some people happy. One of the best things about bitcoin imo is that it makes inflation impossible (except for mining, which is temporary). Bring on the day when a recession happens and the government can no longer make it worse through the misguided policy of printing money.",1525658456

Segwit had opposition, but we managed to get it through. That was a big win IMO. No2x prevented a contentious HF which was another big win. Now we are seeing LN mature more and more each day.

"Crypto exchanges are a little weird. They operate like a broker/exchange and, to my understanding, they pass orders to the corresponding network. You can think of a multi-asset exchange like NASDAQ as a posting board with the ability to support massive in/out streams of data (over-simplifying). However, the exchange typically doesn't serve as the transacting mechanism.

Beyond core functionality of aggregation and matching, crypto exchanges are substantially behind in terms of security (what government regulators care about), reliability (what banks/funds care about), and speed of market/data access (what consumers should care about). ",1525657933

This is for a number of reasons:

1. They do not provide any specific technical reasons for their hyperbole. Usually its some vague statement about the price movement. No intrinsic value, too fast too quick, bubble, sheeple following sheeple etc.

2. They lump all cryptocurrencies together. As far as they are concerned, Bitcoin and BitConnect are one and the same. There is never any nuanced discussion about whether one has a better probability of success than another.

3. Other than media attention, there is nothing for them to gain by denouncing cryptocurrencies so harshly. They claim they have no short positions so there should be no financial impact to them. So why not just say it is outside your risk limits instead of unnecessarily comparing it to ""rat poison""?

I'd also like to have the ability to buy Amazon gift card credit using BTC \- just send to my Amazon account wallet address. I'd like to be able to pay my bills this way as well, with a BTC wallet for each of my main accounts that I can send to. I'd like someone to give me an easy\-to\-use wallet service that will track my accounts ans transfers, send me reminders of due bills and integrate with tax software so I can pay my tax.

"Bitcoin transactions are not defined by network, but by records of part transactions. Eg: I have 1 bitcoin before the fork, I then then 0.5 Bitcoin. After the fork, I still have 0.5 bitcoin because that's what my balance was. Hence, after the fork, you still have 0.5 Bitcoin because you have spent 0.5 bitcoin out of the original 1 bitcoin that you had. The record is kept and the blockchain integrity is still maintained. Your coins remained the same. Remember, bitcoin is a trustless ledger that keeps track of everybody's transaction and the movement of money. The exact blockchain was duplicates and records were maintained and we just continued from there after August fork. It's exactly the same records but bigger blocks. The reason they create replay protection is to separate BCH from BTC so that people do not use segwit on BCH and people who want to use BTC can continue so. There replay protection helps people to continue to use the original bitcoin on BCH while BTC segwit can go on through the BTC network. You have to separate the network otherwise people will send both bch and btc using the same private key.

BCH was a chance for people who use bitcoin to continue using it, a redemption from segwit.

In fact, BCH is increasingly adding more functions, applications, smart contract, etc. Who do you think wins? Faster, cheaper, multi function, on chain applications and smart contract? Or small expensive blocks when mempool is high? BTC don't even have any functionality, see how fast ethereum catched up to BTC after vitalik went over and did smart contracts.

For price comparison, it's a simple mathematic calculation you can verify yourself. https://youtu.be/oTF5EPDzHFs
Verify and calculate yourself, don't get eaten up by rbitcoin propoganda. They only talk about price and asking people to stop using bitch when mempool is high, nobody is building applications, nobody is building protocol upgrades, nobody is adding functions in rbitcoin. Correct me if the above is wrong and send me proof because I'm really curious on how do you expect to build applications on Bitcoin when 1mb is your maximum block size. In fact, the original whitepaper says there is OP Codes in bitcoin, where you can build fungibility and logics into Bitcoin, something that rbitcoin isn't planning to do in accordance to the original whitepaper.",1525656710

"My best guess is that, because this was early on in Bitcoin's existence, the same way that the 1MB blocksize limit was considered a good idea back then to protect the chain from a poisonous block in its infancy \(when mining a block was no big deal for your average hobbyist\), it also seemed like a good idea to limit the applications for which the Bitcoin blockchain could be used so that the barriers to entry for mining remained small to allow for the initial growth of the network. Satoshi had no way of knowing Bitcoin would become a worldwide phenomenon with the incentives built into the system maturing so quickly.

Or maybe he knew plenty well, but he was just being over\-protective of the network. There had never been a contentious chain split \(and it would be a long time before there was one!\), and the idea of allowing for some types of transactions that some miners wouldn't want to store, which could lead to a chain split, might have been worrisome for Satoshi. I'm sure the idea of a chain split over something like that was something he would want to desperately avoid, maybe even irrationally. \(Of course, as we well know, limiting the functionality of the blockchain is what actually led to the first contentious chain split of Bitcoin into BTC and BCH, which is plenty ironic.\)


\&gt;The networks need to have separate fates.  BitDNS users might be completely liberal about adding any large data features since relatively few domain registrars are needed, while Bitcoin users might get increasingly tyrannical about limiting the size of the chain so it's easy for lots of users and small devices.

This is an interesting statement. Some might use it to support the claim that Satoshi would have been/is a ""small blocker"". But I think it more likely supports the theory above, that Satoshi worried that the financial incentives built into Bitcoin weren't mature enough to handle many different applications being built on its blockchain. It seems reasonable to me to worry that some miners \(who, at the time, were really just hobbyists\) wouldn't be willing to store that kind of data on their hard drives when the Bitcoin they were getting ""paid"" in to do it wasn't worth diddly squat.

It's very clear to me, however, that, now that the ecosystem is infinitely more mature, where mining is a \*\*business\*\* not a \*\*hobby\*\*, we can rely on the financial incentives of the blockchain to work as well as we could ever expect them to, where the currency ""Bitcoin"" is enabled by a distributed timestamp server secured by proof of work \(aka a blockchain\), and that server \(aka blockchain\) can be taken advantage of by anyone, so long as they pay a fee that convinces a miner to add their transaction to the current block candidate.",1525654036

* Universal adoption of account prefixes for every crypto (BTC, ETH, BCH, ...), so your wallet knows exactly what chain an address refers to even if you don't.  Saves on mistakes and hassle.

* Voluntary addition of automatic third party authentication that can be paused so all your wallets freeze and unfreeze if you are ever concerned about their security, and simple way to move all accounts to new key accounts, coordinate all that between wallets.

* Wallets on desktops that are essentially Quickbooks accounting apps, making record keeping a breeze for taxes, managing expenses and other regular accounting that banks normally do for people.

"&gt; Not necessarily - there will always be trade. I believe this to unsubstantiated as I don't think investment ends with bitcoin despite it rewarding you for saving it.

Sure, there will always be trade, but that doesn't mean creating a profit incentive for hoarding money doesn't have a negative effect on trade. Hyper-inflation doesn't stop trade either, but it does fuck it up an awful lot by creating an incentive to spend money far faster than people otherwise would. It's not a black and white binary position, its a sliding scale, the worse deflation/inflation is the more its going to distort an economy.

People forget that you can hoard a currency and still trade by other means, [which is what started to happen during the Great depression when the USD went up 30% in value so people started hoarding money and resorting to barter where possible.](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/imKcjD4yrqY/hqdefault.jpg) Which is why their intuitive sense of ""people will still have to spend money so deflation won't be a problem"" is wrong.

People like to cite infrangibility as the cause of previous deflationary money shortages, but a dollar was still worth less in 1930 than in 1900. It wasn't the indivisibility of a cent that caused people to resort to barter, a cent still bought more in 1900. there were more dollars in 1930 than 1900, they were just changing hands less because of the incentive to hoard.

&gt;If someone has the option to hoard bitcoin and see x% growth per year vs. actually invest that bitcoin and see x% PLUS investment growth per year why is it popular to assume many people would not choose option 2.

If you loan a business 100 units of a currency with 5% annual deflation for one year, just paying you back the original 100 means paying the equivalent of 105, but why would you ever lend them 100 just to get 100 back? If you get paid back 100 you're no better off than when you started, except the other person got the benefit of the 100 for that time, and they might not pay you back.

That means a minimum return on investment is already priced into currency, which means hoarding currency (which creates no wealth) automatically becomes more profitable than low-return investments (which create wealth). 

You need to adjust for deflation for these calculations to make sense, If you have $100,000 and 10% deflation, why build a factory that will return $9,000 of profit a year, when just keeping hold of the $100,000 will net you the equivalent of $10,000? Every year of deflation your factory and the goods it produces will be decreasing 10%. The only way it pays more to hold a $100,000 factory than $100,000 is if the return on the factory is higher than the return on the money.

This is the problem deflationists have of framing things only in terms of benefits of the money holder. If money buys more and more than means whover is receiving the money gets less and less. You can't conjure value from thin air. The only people who benefit from deflation are money holders and they only benefit to the extent others lose out, and since the only purpose of money is to facilitate trade, a currency that punishes trade and rewards hoarding is exactly what you don't want, which is why no nations have deflationary currencies.

Once you factor in the cost of actually arranging the investment and the risks associated, you actually need the investment to do significantly better than the rate of deflation, since there's no point risking a large amount of money just for a .1% return, since the return is not greater than the risk. So if there's 5% deflation, it now only makes sense to invest in things that make at least 6-7%, and many investments just wont provide that level of return. The zero sum answer to this is ""good, that means money will only go to the most profitable things"", but that is not good, because wealth isn't zero sum and profitability is not a measure of how efficient something is. Many of the most efficient businesses have the lowest margins because intense competition drives price down to cost as much as possible. 

&gt;1 - This premise also massively underestimates peoples' ability to blow all of their wealth too. The more you have, the wilder your taste for spending it. On the contrary some wealthy people are generous philanthropists who give all or most of their wealth away. Others will destroy their wealth through extravagance and shitty investments.

&gt;2 - Furthermore, if someone never spends their coins they reduce the supply of coins (just as if they'd lost them), increasing the value of other coins and allowing the economy to redistribute their wealth to all other bitcoin holders.

&gt;3 - Are rent-seekers a bad thing in a sound money economy? As you call it, bitcoin removes much of the incentive by the rich to invest their coins in production capacity. This means that the little guy does not have to compete with as many big corporations and will invest their time and labor into moving up the rung of society until they to have enough to retire on.

1 - This is a side issue at best. There will still be philanthropists and trust fund kids regardless if the money is deflationary, inflationary or neutral. Accumulation of wealth is not the primary problem of deflationary currency. In most cases it makes it worse but you could still redistribute it if it was better in every other way.

2 - See1

3 - Any rent seeking is bad for the economy as it distracts effort and resources away from producing wealth into simply gaining wealth by making other people worse off.

&gt; the banning

What does banning people who discuss big blocks or altcoins in /r/bitcoin have to do with Blockstream controlling bitcoin?

&gt; the smear campaigns

Lmao you cannot be serious. You're smearing Bitcoin Core developers and Blockstream right now.

&gt; said how easy it is to control the narrative as the admin

This is so trivial and irrelevant - what matters is the code and whether you choose to run it or not. Neither Theymos nor Blockstream have control over Bitcoin development.

&gt; This isn't something you can pretend doesn't exist man, there's far too much proof of it. 

Here's the reality: Bitcoin Core is an open source software project. Anyone can contribute. Anyone can jump on the IRC and submit their thoughts/proposals. Anyone can make a pull request on the github. Blockstream has no control over what gets into Bitcoin, and never has.

What really happened is that Roger Ver and a bunch of other businessmen and miners decided they wanted big blocks, and if the community and developers didn't agree then they would fork the coin, confident that they were right. Well evidently they weren't right, judging by the fact that the community have remained with the people who are actually *technically knowledgeable*, instead of following the businessman off a cliff.",1525647471
"You'd rather have a government assault sooner rather than later?  I'm the opposite.  The longer we have to build up public acceptance of crypto the less the government will be able to do about it.  That's part of the reason we need to be focused on adoption now.

I know.  And it is certain that a material government assault will slow or freeze adoption.  Any thinking otherwise is naive. ",1525647354
"&gt;  Calculate how much time

The best way to estimate how much time a transaction will take to validate is by its size. (It's impossible to know how much time a transaction will take to validate until you actually do it; only an estimation can be produced beforehand) A block full of never-before-seen and difficult-to-validate transactions would have to be very large to produce this effect, so a moderate block size limit (in excess of demand, but below the feasibility of this attack) would be the solution.

Today's systems can validate transactions significantly faster than those of early Bitcoin. The required amount of data for such an attack to be effective today is well beyond the capacity limits of 2010 (and even the future capacity limit of Bitcoin Cash).",1525647322

"I am a physicist and I work in condensed matter, so this isn't my exactly my area, but I do have some familiarity with quantum computing. 


A true general quantum computer will mean serious trouble for pretty much all forms of cryptography. To understand why, you have to understand what makes a quantum computer so fearsome.  A classical computer will get a linear increase in processing power with more transistors.  If you have N transistors, you can store and operate on N states that are either 1 or 0.  A quantum computer's processing power increases much faster than any polynomial though; it increases exponentially with the number of qubits used (these are the quantum-equivalent processing units). If you have N qubits, you can store and operate on 2^N states--states could be 1, 0 or some combination.  This is where the crazy scaling comes in.

&gt;Will this break crypto too? Will every coins need a y2k style panic fork against quantum fears.

Every single crypto will need a fork to implement some sort of quantum resistant algorithm for encryption (if they haven't already) to mitigate a quantum computer's vast processing power. 

&gt;Fyi, I don't care if you think quantum computing is viable or really far away. I'm asking if it works there way it should in theory what that means for us.

I am sure it has been said, we are a long way off from a general quantum computer.  There would have be be a bunch of big break through discoveries and engineering triumphs first.  Dephasing/coherence is a big problem to tackle.  Much of the theory is there and well developed and understood, but the implementation is pretty far off. That being said, however....there are commercial, purpose-built quantum computers available now that can solve a certain class of problems (QUBO-problems), and very well I might add. I doubt one could use one of these computers to break encryption since that is a more general problem.

&gt; Mine all remain coins super easily?

A general purpose quantum computer would smoke any computer out there at hashing.  As for the quantum computers we have now, like D-wave, it might be possible to map the hashing problem to a QUBO problem such that it could be solved.  If it is possible, the speed with which it could mine/hash really depends on how many qubits are actually available for processing. It could be faster or it could be slower.",1525647263

"Chris is right that it may be more convenient for filtering. But as always in crypto, there is no straightforward right or wrong answer.  In that spirit, let me balance out chris's point by pointing out one ""advantage"" of the approach taken by blockpress (which couldn't have happened when they used memo.cash's protocol):

Memo.cash uses multiple push datas for the OP_RETURN. But according to the Bitcoin documentation, this is not considered standard: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script#Flow_control

&gt; Currently it is usually considered non-standard (though valid) for a transaction to have more than one OP_RETURN output or an OP_RETURN output with more than one pushdata op.

This means blockpress approach of having a single pushdata is considered ""standard"" while memo.cash is not.

Now, I am not sure what this will mean going forward. Maybe the decision by blockpress will prove to be the right one. Or maybe the memo.cash's approach might be the better design. We never know, just like how there's no 100% straight-forward answer to whether BTC or BCH will absolutely succeed. Each has its pros and cons. And that's what I am talking about. The community shouldn't try to bury one competing protocol just for the sake of making a single ""king"". At the end of the day, all these are all nothing but BCH protocols.

He merely said that it **wouldn't surprise him if he were shot**. Can you honestly not distinguish the difference there? If not, that's seriously alarming and you should seek a basic education to make up for this deficit.

2. Given the number of people he's negatively impacted, **it wouldn't surprise me** if he were physically attacked in some way at some point in time by a member of the aforementioned group.

"&gt; And then proceeds to list 4 elements of trust

4 elements of ""trust"" that are always true and thus require no actual trust.

&gt; And SPV is completely powerless against protocol changes

LOL nope. In fact it's the safest response to protocol changes since it will automatically follow the chain with the most cumulative PoW. You clearly don't understand SPV.

&gt; if full nodes accept a protocol change where the block reward is suddenly 10BTC for ever

That's beyond a 51% attack, that's a 100% attack! Nothing is gonna help you against a 100% attack. I don't understand this strange mania to use pure theoretical and practically impossible attacks to say that SPV is not safe, when a full node is also useless under these conditions...

&gt; an SPV has no idea about the validity of the UTXO set

Yes it does: if a transaction has more than 2 conf it's valid. No miner will mine on top on a block with invalid transactions, because he will get orphaned soon after. SPV doesn't need to check all the transactions ever made, but it knows when a transaction is valid same as full nodes.

&gt; guess how much will he be paid? Exactly zero

Bullshit, there'll always be some buyer. Even if there isn't, a miner can simply mine another coin, there's thousands... Where's the ""cat and mouse game"" here? The miner wins either way.

&gt; Remember S2X/NYA? Some ~85% of hash power was supporting it. It didn't happen.

Exchanges were ready to support, but it didn't happen because miners realized they already had a backup plan: Bitcoin Cash. If Core fails, they'll simply switch to it, no need to create another worse fork with segwit.

&gt; Do you think Greg or Adam spend their time holding me at gunpoint so I run Bitcoin Core instead of some other software?

They don't need a gun, and they already did it: they imposed the ""no block increase"" and treated Bitcoin as a brand they own. As a consequence they also imposed 2dn layers (LN) because no way in hell they'll ever gain adoption with a 2Mb chain.

&gt; not with a ""formalized proof"", but with simple common sense

That's not ""proof"" in any way. In fact ""common sense"" suggests that LN will never scale unless they solve routing or go centralized, let alone be better than on-chain scaling.

&gt; more centralized

That's like saying ""more pregnant"". Decentralization is a binary property, the queen bee either exists or doesn't. 100'000 nodes owned by 1 person is centralized, 1'000 nodes owned by 1'000 people is decenralized. That's also the main reason why they haven't been able to provide any formal proof: they're confusing entropy/Gini coefficient/Lorenz curve, a continuous variable, with decentralization, a binary property. Also, the only nodes that matter for centralization are mining nodes and what matters it's their hashpower and not their numbers, you clearly didn't understand Bitcoin.

&gt; Rick is a politician with zero understanding of ANY engineering

You don't need to be an engineer to notice how Core didn't provide a single formal proof to their claims. Yes, if there was any formal proof you'd need the help of an engineer to understand it, but there isn't... anybody with 2 working neurons and Google can notice it.

&gt; The small blockers are saying we need to improve the aerodynamics, the suspensions, the gears transmissions

LOL nope, small blockers are saying that you need to keep the engine power capped to 2 mph ""because decentralization"", and that we must build a plane on top of the car, attach the two and finally the car will be able to reach 200 mph decades from now, if everything doesn't become a ball of fire. Big blockers are saying ""why don't just remove the limiters on the damn engine and start going to 40 mph right now, while we work on better engine, aerodynamics, suspensions, gears transmissions?"". Yes, it's that simple.

&gt; big blockers don't give a shit about people with shitty connections

Any shitty connection can run SPV. It's small blockers that have a totally unmotivated fear of it, to the point of crippling the chain for everyone.

&gt; He explicitly said ""blocks can be extended for ever""

Yes, and I cleared your misconception by adding that this doesn't cause the blockchain to grow to infinity, since we can easily prune it.

The masses just want convenience, novelty, and the illusion of safety. 
It doesn’t matter who was there first, who has the better product, or who has the best ideals at heart. All that matters is who can bridge the gap between fiat and crypto the best and make mass adoption possible. The fact of the matter is, many more people would be willing to follow a big bank into the crypto world rather than some obscure entities they haven’t heard of or that brings up bad memories.

All of this is to try to find out what block sizes are possible with what technology, finding out the healthy max blocksize at a given time. As computing power continues to increase every year, the blocksize can grow in step with computing power forever.

So what if computing increases are not enough? There are many projects in the works to help deal with large blocks such as

"It does, because at the time of Bitcoin XT (mainly involved the decision to increase blocksize) being debated, the community was largely in favour of it, but Blockstream, who had control of the subreddit (which at the time was one of the main hubs for Bitcoin communities), provably censored and banned XT supporters. They attacked exchanges for accepting it, and DDOS'd miners running XT nodes (this is all provable if you don't believe me).

So by forcing bitcoin to go one way, by censoring the community, I'd say the main community hub had a HUGE impact on what we call Bitcoin today. It is what Blockstream wanted it to become - not what the community (and Gavin, the guy who Satoshi passed lead development down to) wanted.

I very recently got introduced to this information. For that I was strongly anti-BCH, despite not knowing the history. Please, for the sake of fair arguments, don't dismiss because of your opinions. It's all factual and provable. ",1525642969

Part of that is deciding if segwit and other advances are right for your company. All bitcoin tech is opt-in From the bottom up. If you are making those kinds of decisions because it's too much work though, this might be the wrong market for you to be an early adopter at the infrastructure level.

Of course it is, did you see what happened to BTC? The consensus process? But in that instance there is no choice, the blockchain format must be the same for every one.

"If you want peer to peer electronic cash that the masses (not speculators) will use, it’s a crypto that has a set value that doesn’t fluctuate wildly.

They may like that their 50 is now 60 but going the other direction would not be acceptable. 

In this sense, both bitcoin and bch, or any other currency coin has failed. The theory is that the value of these will go up so high that in a few years the fluctuation will be minimal. 

The solution already exists. Dai for example is always worth 1 dollar, or dgx is tied to the price of gold. These have much smaller fluctuations and already work. They are ethereum tokens and have the security of the eth chain. Users can already from their ledger trade any of their tokens for dai without funds ever leaving their wallet. ",1525642031
"As a [federally licensed pyro](https://i.imgur.com/cBtiARw.png), I'll clear up this explosives stuff.

Consumer firecrackers are limited in the amount of explosive composition that they can contain. There is an exemption for agricultural use. So several manufacturers attempted to use this loophole by creating ""overloaded"" firecrackers, generally known as M80s to the public, and sold them as agricultural pest control products. Anyone could purchase these as a grey market item. The loophole was very similar to the herbal fake drugs sold as ""For incense use only. Not for human consumption"" when everyone knew what they were being sold as.

Roger bought a whole lot of them wholesale and was reselling them online. But just as the government laughed at the salvia/Spice loophole, they laughed at this firecracker loophole. Now, as a federal licensed explosive handler, this kind of thing is extremely common, and still happens to this day. The feds picked Roger and made an example out of him. The difference between Roger and the thousands of bootleggers out there is that Roger sold them online and shipped them. The other bootleggers simply sold them face to face.

Assuming you're already saving 20% to traditional strategies and that crypto isn't more than 2% of your savings dollars monthly that means you're saving $2000/mo and $100/mo to crypto. You can probably afford a $100 one time expense.",1525641312

So incidentally, I do call BCH Bitcoin Cash (or I use Falkvinge's Bitcoin BTC and Bitcoin BCH terminology), but the fact is there's less deceit and scamminess going on than you think from the BCH camp because there is a case to be made that BTC stole the Bitcoin name not based on merits but based on a quirk of history. Namely rBitcoin's censorship and disinformation, the irrational impression cryptocurrency speculators had that they needed to appeal to the authority of the Core devs, and that BTC retained the original ticker symbol and consequently was perceived (incorrectly) as the Bitcoin of old and BCH was perceived as the spinoff. 

What conspiracy did I come here with may I ask btw?

&gt;There is no majority support for your narrative. Everyone I talk with think BCH is a shitcoin and that is largely because of its goal of destructing instead of building.

Wait what narrative? That at some point in history most of the Bitcoin community were big blockers? This is obviously true. Nowadays it isn't and I didn't say it was. Also have you even been following BCH? BCH builds things all the time. 

The rate of innovation and things being built on BCH seems way faster than on BTC. BTC's just been experimenting with evolutionary dead-ends like lightning and infinitesimally small space-saving improvements that require changes in user behaviour to be effective like Schnorr and MAST--so Segwit all over again, see 33% Segwit adoption 8 months after it was deployed.

1) Write ""Bitcoin Cash"" instead of ""Bitcoins Cash"" in several places.

2) Remove the ""Amount"" field and just mix whatever the user sends you. This is because of fees, if you want to mix 100% of the crypto you have on an address it's a bother to first needing to calculate the amount to send in order to get 0 change and then paste that amount into your website. It would be more user-friendly if in my wallet I could simply specify the exact amount I know I have and then check the ""Subtract fee from amount""-checkbox and just send without needing to think about exactly how much bitcloak.ru gets. How problematic this can be varies from wallet to wallet.

3) Differentiate more between BTC mode and BCH mode. I actually accidentally first pasted my mixer ID on the BTC page and got ""Error: invalid Mix ID submitted"". I soon realized that I was on the wrong page but just mentioning either (BCH) or (BTC) everywhere would make the user feel safer.

+ It started with me receiving BCH: https://explorer.bitcoin.com/bch/address/bitcoincash:qq024rpszqwaqvz3qmylhas4tvnhsgxlwg6jngtcfn

+ I launched Tor Browser and went to bitcloak.ru

+ I used the menu in the top right corner to change to English and then again to select the BC symbol (for BCH).

+ Now I clicked the red ""Mix my Bitcoins!""-button.

+ I pasted my receive address (""qz20wkqlqg0jgte0vsstedspgrv576eyec23akr0lg"") into the field saying ""Payout Bitcoin Cash Address (CashAddr format"").

+ In ""Amount"" I wrote 0.0109 and in ""Delay (hours)"" I put 3. Note: I was given 0.011 BCH for this experiment but I had to reserve some satoshis for the fee. I used the receive address as change address just for demonstrational purposes (will be easy to compare the timestamps later).

+ Now I pressed the red ""MIX MY BITCOINS CASH!""-button (sic).

+ I got the following message:

+ I receive 0.01059147 BCH on https://explorer.bitcoin.com/bch/address/1EafKAntXNm3cW6U7BpteMZuY34FbbxCwW so the mixer's fee was 0.00030853 (2.83% of the amount I originally sent to bitcloak.ru). It says in the FAQ that the fee is randomized around 2% + 0.00005 BCH. So expect around 3% fee?

+ We can now compare the time stamps on the blockchain since the change address was the same as the receive address. The difference between 19:05:29 and 16:09:58 is just a few minutes over three hours, which is the correct amount of delay I had requested for the transaction.

+ Here is the transaction for my receival: https://explorer.bitcoin.com/bch/tx/574340546219fd29a8605f51ea26863de047fa0c75bc20706a80938d3cbb3434

+ If somebody were to step backwards in order to track me this is the transaction they would arrive at.

+ If I step forward from my own original sent transaction it would appear that the BCH I sent never touch the transaction that I receive. Anonymization was successful!

"&gt; I earned the money myself working retail. Family and friends are all critics, skeptics, or try to explain to me an area which they no little to nothing about.

**Sigh** same &amp; likewise. I've been saving my OJT savings and invested (risked + researched) on an exchange ICO on the month of July 2017. It turns out pretty good and now I'm planning to invest it into another exchange ICO with a passive income dividend. Sadly, my family doesn't Trust The Process nor even trusts my plans. They've been telling me that cryptocurrency is a scam and it's a Ponzi scheme. My father kept telling me that for many years of his own experience, he has been scammed a lot of times. He told me that I should listen to him because he is much more older than me and of course he is my father. Amusingly, I end up playing dumb (pretending) &amp; promised that I would cashed out my crypto holdings then transfer it into a fiat bank deposit on a Bank account. By which I'm buying some time or maybe enough time before I could make this ICO work. I don't want my plans to be jeopardized because of a naive mindset from an old stone age.

He has bent some rules and broken some laws to push BCH in any way he can as he perceives this to be an all out war between decentralised money and a hijacked Bitcoin.      
Now, whether or not his perception of reality is true is open to debate.  But I wouldnt say he is a fraudster either way, just someone who has waded a little out of his depth on the tech side and isnt afraid of breaking rules to achieve what he wants.

"21 million and 8 decimal points was carefully chosen because of amount of precision available in double-precision floating point. Even though integer numbers of satoshis should always be used when dealing with Bitcoin, Satoshi knew that at some point people would screw up and do math in floating point at some point, so this would prevent issues due to loss of precision.

A good explanation is in this article (by none other than Vitalik Buterin) https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/satoshis-genius-unexpected-ways-in-which-bitcoin-dodged-some-cryptographic-bullet-1382996984/

&gt; Thus, all in all, the total number of currency units that will ever exist stands at 2,100,000,000,000,000: 2.1 quadrillion, or about 2**50.899. In choosing this figure, Satoshi was much luckier, or wiser, than most people realize.

&gt; Because many higher-level programming languages (eg. Javascript) do not expose the low-level ""floating point"" and ""integer representations"", instead providing the programmer with only the concept of ""number"" - represented in floating point form, of course. If Satoshi had chosen 210 million instead of 21 million, Bitcoin programming in many languages would be considerably harder than it is today.",1525637727

You might say *yes, but we can just fork again* and this is true but if the spirit of Bitcoin has moved to Bitcoin Cash now, Bitcoin had a huge setback.

Now think about this ... did that ever even make sense? Why then not use Litecoin which has even more room for transactions than BCH. Many alts are even much much better on that front.  

The second possible argument was that Segwit won't work - well, it does, and now you have 4MB effective transaction space. Oh, and then it was ""Lightning Network won't work"". Well, it does too. And it allows you buy your crypto coffee for even less fees than BCH.

Considering that the core devs were proven right, and the BCH devs wrong. And that that the BCH devs screwed up the mining algo, we can now also conclude that technically Bitcoin has the better development, thus better tech.

No other crypto gets me as excited as Cardano. I think their timing in the market is perfect.. there’s a very fine line between being too early and too late when it comes to new industries or technologies. In battle/war terms the first ones through the door get shot and pave the way for the ones that follow. Most of the top internet companies were not first through the door, which is why I think Cardano will ultimately topple ETH. 

The way they set everything up is genius .. academics/offices/devs all over the globe ... how would you legislate that!?  .. leading to a better shot at true decentralization.. 

They are a 3 headed monster withEmurgo/IOHK/and the Cardano foundation. People think they are going slow but they are working on everything at the same time.. while IOHK actually develops the project, Emurgo is simultaneously working on the business end of things.

They will be backwards compatible, basically meaning any erc20 token can seamlessly transfer over from ETH to Cardano.

"Yeah, your definition is the most accurate, but it's a complete mouthful. I only casually follow it, but at the fork not increasing blocksize was what BTC stuck with.  They were the ones that kept the Bitcoin value, where BCH became a different coin with a different value. It doesn't matter that until that point they were identical. I've never heard anyone complain about Bitcoin gold, unlimited, XT etc. Nearly every complaint I hear about BCH is the way it is marketed, and the blatant lies on bitcoin.com. It says that Bitcoin is not a digital currency, and yet only displays BTC chart history.

Bitcoin to refer to the various Satoshi implementations: it's just needlessly confusing. Bitcoin made the decision to do lightning/segwit. I think that Bitcoin Cash just should have chosen a different name. ""Bitcore"" or ""Bitcash"" or ""Bitcoin classic"" like ETH and ETC. It maintains, and demonstrates that it is sticking closer to the original implementations.

"&gt; If all these things I hold for true are indeed true, how can he or anyone else deny that in a decentralized, trustless world, no one should be this influential?

Influence and decentralization are two orthogonal concepts. Roger Ver's relationship with Bitcoin doesn't mean he is the owner and proprietor with the coin. He's simply a social icon connected to it. To say otherwise is false and is an appeal to identity. 

Going further, it is inevitable that within any movement there will be a few influential figures of leadership. That is human nature and is a consequence of not everyone having the same skillset, motivations, etc. As long as these figures retain public good will and take heed of the consensus of the organization, it's a good system.

People need to be incentivized to run LN at present, because the benefits are not immediate and it's not yet as convenient as using plain Bitcoin. If you just scale up the block size people won't bother with LN and will continue using regular Bitcoin transactions.

"Good read - thanks for the write up.  It's a lot to think about, and I'm no economist to bare with me here. 

&gt;For each unit of wealth you produce you need a currency token to represent it, else you will create a perverse incentive not to use currency tokens for trade, but instead to do nothing with them, and wait for other people to produce more wealth so that your tokens increase in value.


Not necessarily - there will always be trade.  I believe this to unsubstantiated as I don't think investment ends with bitcoin despite it rewarding you for saving it.  Many people will always try to use their wealth to increase that production capacity (wealth) .. as you explained.  

If someone has the option to hoard bitcoin and see x% growth per year vs. *actually* invest that bitcoin and see x% PLUS investment growth per year why is it popular to assume many people would not choose option 2.  What you do with it -- in terms of investments -- is going to be determined by what's profitable after risk is accounted for. For people to hoard their wealth you'd have to assume that all investment opportunity has been reduced to zero, after risk is accounted for.

This premise also massively underestimates peoples' ability to blow all of their wealth too. The more you have, the wilder your taste for spending it.  On the contrary some wealthy people are generous philanthropists who give all or most of their wealth away.  Others will destroy their wealth through extravagance and shitty investments.

Furthermore, if someone never spends their coins they reduce the supply of coins (just as if they'd lost them), increasing the value of other coins and allowing the economy to redistribute their wealth to all other bitcoin holders.

Are rent-seekers a bad thing in a sound money economy?  As you call it, bitcoin removes much of the incentive by the rich to invest their coins in production capacity. This means that the little guy does not have to compete with as many big corporations and will invest their time and labor into moving up the rung of society until they to have enough to retire on.



Again,  I'm not an economist, nor am I sure I'm even smart enough on the topic to be having this conversation while remaining consistent and thoughts and understanding of it all, but it's fascinating stuff and I appreciate the dialog.  ",1525632852

"&gt; Fake Bitcoin txs don't exist. Only two metrics: validity and economic feasibility measured by miner

You are missing the point, when a miner signs herself a ton of TX, ignores the mempool, and tries to mine those, she is basically at the same odds  of finding a block as the rest of the network and there is nothing forbidding it (you can't prove the addresses in the Tx belong to the miner).

Hence, those Tx are free to the miner, no matter the fees, can be 1 thousand dollar fee per Tx, it all comes back to the miner anyway.

But the network get screwed over when the miner successfully mines her private block and propagates everything, the other miners will need to download the entire set of ""fake"" tx and will get stuck.

Needless to say: if such thing happens, the other miners can simply start mining on top of the block head that come pretty fast (only 80 bytes) and don't pick any Tx in the mempool (to not risk getting a Tx already mined in the new work), and mine themselves an empty block while they receive and check the Tx incoming from the last block just mined. 

But there is a big risk of a single Tx being invalid and they lose their new work. But also, in that case, the attacker produced a valid PoW with an invalid Tx in her block. That's just a waste of money, they threw away 12.5 BCH+fees to make others lose, it is irrational.",1525632283

There is a silver lining.  The bitcoin cash community has become hardened against social attacks and takeover. This was a huge vulnerability for the original bitcoin. We may have lost time but it wasn’t completely wasted. The social attacks could have happened later and time would have been lost later.  I am just glad that bitcoin cash survived such a huge vulnerability thanks to Bitcoin ABC. It could have been much worse.,1525631044
"I have some C20.  It's basically like a specialised mutual index fund for the crypto markets.  So if you don't think you can beat the markets more than an adjusting top-20 exposure, or you'd just rather keep some in that as more of a safer profit, then go for it for sure.    

I think anyone who thinks it's not a good idea, as long as that's not based on scam concerns or whatever, is vastly overestimating their trading and investing ability, or has access to a lot more info and resources than you or I  ",1525631039
"REQ is going to do well, but it might not do well quickly because the team is quite anti-hype. Hasn't recovered as much as a lot of alts yet (less than 1/4 of fiat ATH), so that's one to hold on to I'd say, lots of good things coming, especially when bitcoin oracle gets integrated. The rest I'm not sufficiently informed on to offer any prognosis - I do have a bag of Bounty as well, but feel less comfortable about that recovering than I feel about REQ doing so.",1525631019

"I don’t think this is a terrible idea, if it helps with mass adoption. 

A lot of people would still like to buy their first crypto as easy as possible. 

And going to your local shop and buy a can of veggies and 0,001 btc on the way is very easy and comfortable.

Baby steps, we need the masses, they will learn afterwards:)

"I don't think Satoshi created the innovation of this decade to never do anything innovative with it the years after. Assuming now what Satoshi would do or not do is ridiculous. He left it to others to maintain so that's really the end of it.  
But yes, very definitely the blocksize on BTC should have been increased somewhat, even besides segwit. If you pretend to be a globally used currency/asset you should not care about some bearded hobo with his raspberry blue pie. The community split up is the worst that could have happend to this community and much of it is to blame on the repository maintainers. I don't really care about blockstream in this whole story. They are not / should not be in any position of power over bitcoin. I do think lightning could be a very good addition to crypto. ",1525630783
"This aside, I can tell you just a few reasons:

1. When regulation storm on all fronts, COSS is ready and will triump while many other exchanges are breaking apart or goin into shadow under DEX.

2. Serious money has not entered Crypto-sphere. Serious money would work with Gemini, and serious money from Asia and Pacific islands would  certainly will work with COSS than with Gemini, but they definitely will not work with Binance – and no bank in the world will except banks in Malta would.

3. COSS is operating in a country which has the most strict laws and regulations, and one of the Asia's most important financial hub, with its government being crypto-friendly. In terms of choosing Gemini or any US based exchanges, the finance institutions and Fintech industries in South East Asia as well as Pacific islands would have more confident in Singapore’s government and its regulations than the US’s, which we have Wall Street’s Sharks calling BTC fraud – never mind how foolish they sound, and that the Wall Street as a whole has their interests to support a regulation and lobbying congress to pass a law which is unfriendly towards crytpocurrency. Also, not to mention having to deal with the IRS of the US – for institutions, corporations and even private companies from those regions, using an exchange under US jurisdiction, having to pay tax to the IRS (the insanely complicated tax laws) of the US would likely keep them at bay as it would require them to find tax professionals and tax lawyers who know the US tax laws.",1525630773

What prevents miners from just 'moving on' to other more fresher cryptos.  For the record I am not a crypto basher.  I think it has interesting aspects and obviously blockchain is a key technology.  It's the commitment to long term mining that I have started to grow concerned about.,1525630679
"Huh? When people jump on the bitcoin to the moon bandwagon, with no idea what cryptocurrency trading is they just whack it into Google. Bitcoin.com and @bitcoin are a front for BCH so its easy for them to get duped into it.

Roger Ver saw through the banksters elite master plan to hijack bitcoin and forked off Bitcoin Cash and listed it as BTC on bitcoin . com !

Dont forget the days when BCH was sold for $5000 - $10000 to noobs, they were told to not worry because its gonna BOUNCE TO THE MOON ANYDAY now and flippening is happening because Roger Ver saved the world after commiting felonies and moving out of USA",1525630412

"semantics. the core group wants Bitcoin to be a valuable asset as opposed to a p2p currency, from what I can tell... which makes it seem like big money has gotten involved and wants to limit trading to largescale investors, meaning that big money is trying to control the space for their own interest as opposed to the good of the community... bitcoin is supposed to bank the unbanked; competitive txn fees and confirmation 'fast lanes' make the currency inherently classist and that doesn't seem to be what nakamoto envisioned afaik.",1525630110

"Huh? Price appreciation didn't pay for anything but a huge influx of miners who are no paying anything like ~$6k-$8k in electricity for one bitcoin.

And if we really want to answer your question, with today's hardware available, bitcoin was most definitely not secure in 2012. Meaning that if we go back to 2012 difficulty, a single last gen miner would dominate the entire chain.",1525629920
"I'd also like to add my two cents. 

&amp;nbsp;

When going through the top 100 coins on CMC, how many of them are tokens representing real consumer apps, offering the end users with real usage for their tokens as opposed to tokens representing infrastructure/ blockchain companies? Close to none. 

&amp;nbsp;

What's my point here?

Kin is the first user - based company that builds its activity on top of the blockchain technology, offering real value to users (being developers or gamers, as an example). 

Why is this difference so important? 

&amp;nbsp;

I agree that Kin is not a well - known token today (and that's why I assume you refer to it as a ""shitcoin""). But the fact that it's the only crypto - project out there that understands that the winner in this game will be the one with the largest amount of users (having nothing to do with the market cap, although that will also change over time, as the user base and number of transactions grow), is what will make Kin a much more successful token than all others. 

&amp;nbsp;

Also, comparing it to ETH or BTC is irrelevant, because there is no real incentive to use them, hence mass - adoption is nowhere near seen. Kin's only purpose and reason if existence is to provide real users with real value.

"&gt;By the end of next week, it is expected that Bitcoin Cash would be aiming at a price of $2300-$2400 - which would bring it back to where it was in early January before the markets crashed.

"You reply can also be written like this: ""I’m not sure why every one loves alt-coins"". They seems like a small, unproven, scam exit and with the regulations coming from countries, it is going to be increasingly difficult to compete with coins like BTC, ETH. And in terms of passive income, there are way better way like mining BTC and ETH"".

"There's a bunch of good info there for beginners, but I think your decision to blend in blockchains might be confusing, as it seems (to me) as if they're on the list of different types of cryptocurrencies.  A method I would suggest for structuring it instead, as well as my contribution to what you missed would look like:    

1: Clarify that all cryptocurrencies run on blockchains, or something similar.  These types of blockchains are:    

-bitcoin blockchain  
-ethereum blockchain (explain that it's a blockchain which allows smart contract execution)  
-main/side chain, like ICX, Elastos etc.  fairly important to know that some blockchains are attempting to be full operating systems or at the very least run separate blockchains that connect back up to them  
-Tangle and Lattice: built to solve blockchain's inherent scalability problems    

Then go into currencies.  The different types:    

Store of value: btc, ethereum (although ethereum can be used for contracts to buy other tokens, but this is mostly just a preference of categorising).  probably chuck a couple more in here like vechain/ambrosus for supply because in your classification system they're stores of value and have specific purposes.    

Privacy  
Utility  
True currency (probably stress the difference between bch/xrp and nano/iota)    

For tokens, find a way to work in decentralised exchanges, they're likely to be a big part in the way crypto goes.  The tokens are used typically for exchange fees I guess.  Substratum also a good one to include here - decentralised internet and the tokens used to pay for accessing websites that can't be censored.    

Sorry, the end is unstructured, basically just mentioned a bunch of stuff that I think is important and different enough in the crypto sphere to warrant a mention, and it will give a beginner a good idea of the sort of stuff that's being worked on

",1525627865
"To me, it seems like too many cryptocurrencies are a solution in search of a problem when it should be the other way around. That is, it should be ""Look at this problem that's difficult to solve. I think blockchain can solve it.""

Instead, cryptos start out with ""We, the developers, want to make a boatload of money by starting our own crypto. Let's pretend there is some sort of problem that only we can fix.""

Good example? ""Let's pretend there's a real difficulty in paying your dentist bill. It's so hard to take a credit card out of your wallet or purse and give it to the receptionist. Much easier to take your fiat, convert it to our crypto, then use our crypto to pay the dentist.""

That limit was removed entirely last year.

However, relatively few nodes are running older versions (a little under 3% of the ""listening network"" at this time), so this feature is relatively esoteric and almost irrelevant by now; for all practical intents and purposes, the 1MB limit is completely gone from modern considerations.

"This is silly and laden with confirmation bias. 

&gt;Your employer is pretty hip and they start paying you in this new cryptocurrency because they see the currency rising so they have transferred all the company's cash assets including payroll into a cryptocurrency. 

If this started gaining any traction the government would move to regulate the area, nevermind that ""hip employers"" receive profits in dollars, pay another company (Coinbase) in dollars, and everyone has to have dollars to pay taxes. If their revenue is crypto, they'll have to pull money out of crypto into fiat to pay taxes, forming a net drain out of the market. 

&gt;But like you, they are having to start transacting more business in cryptocurrency as the world marches toward the brave new world

Banks hate volatility. They're not going to transact business in cryptocurrency. If they accept it, it will be immediately transferred into fiat. 

&gt;settle your debts with them are becoming less and less powerful in terms of how much cryptocurrency those dollars can buy

Which is irrelevant, their entire business and all goods and services are still being transacted in fiat. 

&gt;In real buying power terms, the banks you owe money to start losing buying power when they have to translate dollars they are paid into cryptocurrency, and that is causing the banks to suffer loses to its overall earnings.

They wouldn't transfer stable currency into unstable currency except in a planned, controlled manner (ie. not in a way that will wreak havoc on their bottom line).

Moreover, they could simply make their own cryptocurrency, which people would flock to like moths. GoldmanSachsCoin would be a top 5 currency in days if not hours. 

A more realistic future for cryptocurrency involves a decentralization of the stock market in which you transact shares (coins) of a company on your own terms. None of this great depression garbage.

&gt;along with risk managers in the banks cautioning not to make new loans in crypto because the more the crypto rises in value against existing currencies, the more likely will there be a correction in crypto value that means the crypto collected on the new loans will be worth less than the crypto lent.

It would be insane for a fiat-based bank to offer loans in crypto unless they were pegging it to a subsequent fall in the value of crypto; and these banks have the ability to cause the market to drop like a rock if they so choose. See: manipulation following the futures market opening.

Imagine the first small BTC in the cartoon as year 2011 when the market cap was less than $100million usd &amp; there weren't really any altcoins. Today even though historically speaking the btc dominance is very low the immense amount of interest for altcoins has turned BTC marketcap into a behemoth that cannot be ignored (from $100million to $200billion in 6 years...)  I don't see it necessarily as BTC giving birth (other than to LTC and shitting out BCH) but that XMR &amp; ETH &amp; EOS developed separately &amp; a lot of their capital naturally flowed into BTC.

"&gt;all current encryption will be broken when quantum computing is figured out.

[In theory, yes](https://np.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/8gwfmh/i_know_that_256_bit_security_is_insanely_secure/dyfcbb1/), but some cryptographic algorithms in use are resistant to quantum attacks.

Commonly used public key encryption algorithms are at risk, but symmetric key encryption algos and hash functions are still relatively safe with quantum computing. Unfortunately, the ECDSA used by bitcoin and its clones are vulnerable. If you know the public key, then you'd be able to find the private key and steal coins.

"There's a reason against *ever increasing* block sizes. The reason not to hardfork is that growing the blocks isn't a long term solution, but a short term hack to alleviate the short term problem. A consensus cannot be agreed upon because nobody can agree exactly how big blocks should be and at what rate they should increase. I think most will agree that 1MB is too small, but most will also disagree that we need 32MB blocks at this time, because we're nowhere near needing them.

Making the blocks big now means that we must perpetually carry around large baggage for the lifetime of Bitcoin, because we made a rash decision to grow the blocks before we came to agreement on what the right way of scaling is.

The general consensus in Bitcoin at the moment is that the Lightning Network shows big promise of scaling several orders of magnitude without increasing the block size by any significant amount, and that it's worth trying it out before we jump to the wrong conclusion. There's a minority that thinks ever increasing block sizes are fine, because they think that only miners need to run validating nodes (which means that a only a majority miners decides the *rules* of the protocol). Bitcoiners believe that all merchants in particular, should run their own nodes because it can give them a greater guarantee that they've received payments, on the greatest PoW chain used by the economic majority.

And if we want merchants to run nodes, this does not mean ""only big businesses need to run a node"". A merchant can be a single-person company, or self-employed person. Arguably, it's these who need the guarantee that they've received a payment more than anyone else, because not receiving a payment as a self-employed person might mean they can't pay their bills. A big company not receiving a payment will not suffer to such extent, it will just have a slightly restricted cash-flow.",1525625066

Roger Ver lies more often than he tells the truth. This is not an attack, just an objective observation of the facts.

""Mt. Gox is totally fine."" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP1YsMlrfF0) ... shortly thereafter Mt. Gox implodes ... ""I am here to 'apologize'. Even though everything I said when I told you 'Mt. Gox is fine' was true, I am sorry that some of you lost money when it collapsed. Buy ether.""

""I am banned from posting in /r/Bitcoin"" ... accidentally posts to /r/Bitcoin ... ""Oops. Now I'll pretend like I never claimed to be banned from /r/Bitcoin, and ignore anyone who asks me about that claim.""

""I've dumped a few hundred BTC for BCC""... 2 weeks later: ""I haven't sold a single Bitcoin for Bitcoin Cash up until yesterday""

He lies about the subreddit he controls. He regularly lies about his holdings. He lied and scammed his way into the bitcoin.com domain, which he uses to push out FUD about Bitcoin and its developers. He lies on agreements he signs (e.g. ""the bitcoin.com pool will mine with NYA/btc1/2x code... whoops just kidding, we're mining bcash instead""). He even had the audacity to lie about what happened in court, when there is a public transcript available which disproves everything he said.

There are more examples of blatant deception that I don't have the time or patience to dig up right now. Make no mistake: the man is, unfortunately, a sociopath.

"You can use Java. There's a Bitcoin implementation called BitcoinJ, which is used on most of the Android based wallets. The main Bitcoin implementation, Bitcoin Core, is written in C++ though (which is more difficult for beginners). As a beginner, you should probably not expect to go directly to working on the protocols, but instead focus on the tooling around Bitcoin, like the user interfaces. For example, there are some FOSS android clients that you could contribute to if you learn Android/Java programming, which will make use of BitcoinJ.

You do need to understand the fundamentals of Bitcoin, so I'd recommend reading *Mastering Bitcoin 2nd Edition* by Andreas Antonopoulos, as well as the Bitcoin wiki at Bitcoin.it. You should also read the BIPs as you gain a better understanding of the protocols, and the BOLTs to understand the details of the Lightning Network.

The main concerns with LN on mobile are that current LN clients require full-node Bitcoin clients, which need 200GB and growing of storage, usually too large for mobile use. There needs to be a way to have lightweight LN nodes, which could make use of SPV wallets for transaction verification, and make use of some third-party watchtowers provider(s) who can monitor for malicious users broadcasting old channel state. All of this needs well-designed and simple to use user interfaces.

Other things you could do is web-based tooling around Bitcoin/LN for online services to accept payments. You don't need to worry as much about running the full node and uptime, as most web servers are always online and storage is not an issue. As an = example, you can use lightning from WooCommerce with a plugin. There are many different/similar open source CMS/ERPs that people use aside from WooCommerce or the other ones already supported, and there's also a variety of languages used to program them (mostly Python, PHP, Java, C# and JavaScript). Creating good UIs for accepting payments on any of these platforms will enable large numbers of people to begin accepting payments on their existing websites. (As a bonus, many of these platforms also have plugin stores, so you could monetize any implementations done on them).

Those programming languages are all very similar and a big part of the skills you learn in one will transfer over to the others, but it would probably be best to focus on the one which is commonly used for the task you want to accomplish, because they tend to have their own isolated ecosystems and they don't mix very well in the same projects. Pick Java (or C#) for Android development, JavaScript and Python for web development, or C++/Qt for desktop development. There's no shortage of resources for learning any of these languages.

In terms of specifics you'll need to learn for Blockchain development, you need to understand basic symmetric and asymmetric cyptography, elliptic curve cryptography and the function and purpose of cryptographic hashes (Bitcoin uses SHA256/RipeMD160 in varous places). These are all explained with examples in Mastering Bitcoin, using Python as the example programming language.",1525623217

Absolutely wrong. Could not be more wrong. And SPV is completely powerless against protocol changes, like an increase in block size. Or an increase in block reward. How will an SPV know what is the correct block reward? It won't... if full nodes accept a protocol change where the block reward is suddenly 10BTC for ever, an SPV has no idea about it.

Also, an SPV has no idea about the validity of the UTXO set. A full node, mining or non-mining, replayed all the transactions since the genesis block and does not need any third party to confirm the validity of the UTXO set - It calculated **the** valid UTXO set.

Yes... and SPV and a full node are in the exact same position.

Is it the hodlers, who are not moving the coins anyway, or is it the miners, who have giant electricity bills? How long can the miners keep mining without being paid? Not very long. The ones with highest cost will be the first to get back to the chain. Others will soon follow.

&gt;**3 LOL nope, a swarm of bees all controlled by the bee queen is still centralized**

Ummm.... and who is the queen bee, imposing on people the software to run? Do you think Greg or Adam spend their time holding me at gunpoint so I run Bitcoin Core instead of some other software? Or is it Elizabeth Stark, coercing me into believing me that LN is what we need??

&gt;To prove this claim they need to do 3 steps

This has been proved so many times it's not even funny to talk about anymore. No, not with a ""formalized proof"", but with simple common sense. And by this sub as well!!! Everyone, including you, understands that huge blocks will not be run on home hardware but will require server farms. Just for the sake of the argument, let's say you end up with 1,000 server farms running full nodes. If you argue that this is not more centralized than 100,000s full nodes ran at home, then you should undergo brain transplant.

&gt;Rick noted 

Rick is a politician with zero understanding of ANY engineering. He demonstrates this plentifully in his videos.

&gt;No it isn't. Said user is deliberately choosing a shitty connection when he could easily upgrade to something of this era.

Who are you to comment on what people do and why they do it. There are places in America where there's nothing else BUT Comcast. Maybe the guy cannot afford anything else. Reality is, guy has Comcast and if you want to build a global network you need to account for people like him as well. Especially when that's the reality in on of the most advanced nations on Earth!

&gt;And no, sorry, I've never heard of an engineer that makes a car with the worst case scenario of ""encountering a velociraptor"" or ""having to change the engine with a steam powered one""; that's because both are part of another era and ""I can't run world-scale services on my shitty Comcast connection, and therefore, the world must suffer for it"" it's a laughable statement for every single engineering product on Earth.

You've never heard from an engineer to begin with, or you'd know how product design works.

Also, to pick on your steam engine example... the big blockers are basically saying that to make the Ford Model T race at 200mph all we need are giant, turbo charged engines. The small blockers are saying we need to improve the aerodynamics, the suspensions, the gears transmissions, ...  In other words, small blockers want a Lambo, not a fucking Model T with turbo-charged engine.

But it's refreshing to see openly admitted that big blockers don't give a shit about people with shitty connections, yet one of the biggest mantras around here is how a fucking Bangladeshi farmer cannot afford txs fees.


&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Extra LOL nope

You should pay more attention on the subtleties of language. Rick didn't say *extremely large* or *for a long time*. He explicitly said ""blocks can be extended for ever"". And I called him out on that.

We'll I'm telling you there is.  I've been to enough of them.  And yes, they're organised through secret and closed Facebook groups as are many activist movements, including a whole bunch of Bitcoin and crypto groups that are closed.  

As for whether that's all being watched, I guess that depends on the members and whether authorities have learnt their lessons from things like the criminal justice bill.  I know of very few well organised secret forest raves that get closed down nowadays.

For the first time, they were actually incentivized to create value, and get paid for their contributions. 

With Kik Points, this was with things like simple stickers and digital art and whatnot.

"Yeah and that is what people said three years ago after Adam said it would take six months only to get discouraged and dump Bitcoin for alts. There are a few reasons why I think that late 2019 is going to be the year of mainstream adoption of lightning.  

1. The routing problem. Even small basic payments are still failing. It is a tough problem to solve. If a node in the middle turns off while it has your money then your money is trapped for a day, there needs to be a solution for that prior to adoption.    

2. Both the sender and recipient have to be online with their own lightning node to send or receive. That isn't a realistic expectation for peer to peer payments.  

3. liquidity requirements to prevent sybil attacks. Right now, the LN graph looks great but it also hasn't been attacked yet. What happens when someone with money \(like Ver\) decides to open up a million channels with each hub and then doesn't send a payment. So there is going to be large liquidity providers however this also requires a lot of trust in the network first. So it will take a lot of time to earn that trust before people put tens of millions into these hubs. Look how slow segwit adoption is. 

None of these problems are backbreaking and will be overcome but it is important to realize that these problems take time and people constantly saying that it is going to be ready in six months for years on end is disheartening for everyone. So yeah, be realistic, this isn't happening any time soon, it will happen but it will take time.",1525622563

## What is a 'Derivative'

A derivative is a financial [security](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp) with a value that is reliant upon or derived from an underlying asset or group of assets. The derivative itself is a contract between two or more parties based upon the asset or assets. Its price is determined by fluctuations in the [underlying asset](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underlying-asset.asp). The most common underlying assets include stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, \(insert Bitcoin here\), interest rates and market indexes. 
[https://www.ethereum.org/ether](https://www.ethereum.org/ether)  Ethereum would never be possible without bitcoin—both the technology and the currency—and we see ourselves not as a competing currency but as complementary within the digital ecosystem. Ether is to be treated as ""crypto\-fuel"", a token whose purpose is to pay for computation, and is not intended to be used as or considered a currency, asset, share or anything else.There are many ways in which you can use Bitcoins within the Ethereum ecosystem:

* **Trade BTC for ETH:** multiple third\-party companies are working to make the exchanging of ether and bitcoins as easy and seamless as possible. If so desired one could trade bitcoins for ether with the purpose of executing contracts and trade it back immediately in order to keep their value pegged and secured by the bitcoin network. The latest version of the wallet includes an automatic conversion between ether and bitcoin.
* **Use a pegged derivative:** Ethereum is a great tool for creating complex trading between multiple parties. If you have a source for the price of Bitcoin that all parties trust, then it's possible to create an [ethereum based currency](https://www.ethereum.org/token) whose value is pegged to the market value of Bitcoin. This means that you could trade bitcoins to a token that is guaranteed to always trade back to the same amount of bitcoins while still being fully compatible with other ethereum contracts.",1525622440

Re: your last paragraph, I was having this conversation with someone further up in this thread.  I'm of the opinion that legit projects are still getting tons of money, more money than they'd get from VCs in traditional markets, so I think they should be ok.  Take for example OriginTrail, relatively unknown, maybe legit.  Marketcap right now is $58 million, and 25% of tokens are reserved for founders and development, so that's $14.5 million, pretty damn good, they've probably converted a few mill to cash.  There are also a lot of traditional VC firms entering the crypto market and funding legit projects as well, so even in a full market crash, it seems like the projects with value will have the same opportunities to raise funds than they would if they weren't involved in a bubble like this",1525622050

Does the incentive to buy Kin outweigh all this cost?",1525621020

Many cryptos inflate. Bitcoin inflates. Ethereum inflates. All mining and staking coins inflate.

The demand for Kin will *far* outweigh the inflation. Again, there are only 6 million active users in crypto. There are 15 million monthly active users in Kik *alone*.

It's insane how such a strong sense of community was completely subverted with the help of a few nutcases, $115M in VC money, and a single forum admin.

&gt; I think LN will take a nice step but the main blockchain will still be open. If you buy from an exchange using LN then the exchange won't be able to see where you bring those coins to even on chain which is a great step up. Exchange should start integrating that ASAP.

If all these things i hold for true are indeed true, how can he or anyone else deny that in a decentralized, trustless world, no one should be this influential?
Sure, he's a succesful entrepreneur and he's free to own whatever twitter handle or domain he can get his hands on. Thats all part of the game.

I'm predicting this to happen over time, you will see more and more of these things explode. 


As long as it's in testnet or not fully working yet, people can argue that usecase will be there in the future.

"&gt; Edit: also there are already blocks larger than 1.7x at 30% adoption of segwit.

You're correct, but with inneficiencies in how the addresses are displaced/referenced in the new system, segwit is not a true 4MB = 4MB expansion.

What the parent was saying is that a full 4MB segwit block has the same storage capacity as a 1.7MB non-segwit block.

This compromise between efficiency and size came because it was the only way to expand block capacity while remaining a soft fork.

Because Bitcoin usage is down from the peak, the network hasn't been entirely saturated, but it's close.

Check [Johoe's mempool](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#1,2h). You can see live mempool data. Bitcoin does frequently saturate capacity for a few hours at a time.

Around 9:30 EDT today, there was a block where the minimum fee to be accepted hit 50 sat/byte.

I'm not going to say that full segwit use or lightning can't solve this... The problem is that full segwit use is still a minor expansion and it can't handle much additional use.

Further, lightning requires nodes to always be on and checking which is getting to the realm of unreasonable. To add to that, it's a very complex system and crypto security is literally tested by time. There is no great guarantee that an exploit isn't months, or days out just because it's so new.

Because of that, lightning growth will likely be somewhat limited.

I'm not saying that increasing blocksize isn't without some drawback. There are certainly latency considerations, but there are some good ethereum blog statistics that show uncling rates for 15sec / 330k blocks based on the miner scale, and it starts to give a picture that it's the miners with slow connectivity that cause most of the problem.

There isn't a large body of evidence that shows the network will be impacted in any significant way by 8MB blocks.

A full 32MB may be rough for some miners early on, but network speeds are increasing. To add to that, miners can select capacity in the new system, 32MB won't actually hit untill the average miner can support the bandwidth.",1525620277

Of course some of it is already in, but yeah I'm pretty comfortable assuming most of it is not.  It's a market traded on a technology that requires additional development and infrastructure, and doesn't have the liquidity that traditional markets have.  Banks need to actually develop a lot in order to be able to trade these markets in anything but an underground capacity (cold storage, exchange APIs are unreliable, justify it to managers and clients etc).  I know for a fact that at least the majority of prominent market making firms in my country don't have trading desks in crypto, and a bunch of my friends who work there have been eyeing the markets and wishing that they could jump in at work with their software because it'd be so much more profitable.",1525619984

This means that each future node connecting to the network would benefit from a size reduction of 99.99% in synchronizing the blockchain.

Next to that, the blockchain doesn't rely on Proof of Work or Proof of Stake but they rely on Proof of State. This means the permission to create new blocks come from participation as a *licensed node. A state can occur at any time and is verified by a trusted actor.""

In that sense there is no need to use bitcoin cash just for payments. There are many coins that have ‘free’ transaction.

As long as you use some data and the hash of the previous block it does not matter which data, when the question is whether it is still a blockchain or not.

Eth will definitely be 100% obsolete in the future as a more streamlined smart contract platform will come out at some point. I'm not shitting on ETH at all. Its developers are doing the necessary legwork to pave the way for the future. There will just be something better later. Not that Eth couldn't adapt somehow, but it just seems unlikely.

If you want BCH to suceed, stop creating confusion by calling Bitcoin whatever you like more. Crypto is a rocket science for normies and adoption would be much harder if they find out that there is drama which they don’t understand.

"&gt;Also, why 21 million? If we started out with 100 BTC block reward, we'd have 42 million, which is such an awesome number. 

Per the emails which Mike Hearn released, we can gain some insight into that particular decision:

&gt; My choice for the number of coins and distribution schedule was an educated guess. It was a difficult choice, because once the network is going it's locked in and we're stuck with it. I wanted to pick something that would make prices similar to existing currencies, but without knowing the future, that's very hard. I ended up picking something in the middle. If Bitcoin remains a small niche, it'll be worth less per unit than existing currencies. If you imagine it being used for some fraction of world commerce, then there's only going to be 21 million coins for the whole world, so it would be worth much more per unit. Values are 64-bit integers with 8 decimal places, so 1 coin is represented internally as 100000000. There's plenty of granularity if typical prices become small. For example, if 0.001 is worth 1 Euro, then it might be easier to change where the decimal point is displayed, so if you had 1 Bitcoin it's now displayed as 1000, and 0.001 is displayed as 1.

Why should we have to take someone, one person's word, on what the true bitcoin is? That in itself, is not what bitcoin is about, and you're centralizing the ideology  and swimming against the tide when clearly over 80% of the combined network hashrate are choosing bitcoin core over bitcoin cash.

I'd rather be a serious company getting quick millions in an irrational bubble than having to work for longer to get it otherwise.  I think the only ones who lose here are going to be people speculating.    

Dunno where my contradiction is.  I'm using IOTA as an example of a project that isn't being put out of business by the irrational markets.  They have been spotted by enough companies who are willing to work with and fund them, and they are working 24/7 regardless of what's going on here.  I daresay they're in a far better position right now because of the ridiculous bubble because they had the initial resources to do so much, and didn't squander it",1525617563
Congratulations. However take a minute and understand what you are doing..... Investing. A lot of crypto investors will get burnt. In fact a lot of investors in general get burnt. Be patient be smart and don't make matters worse. The truth is many people don't know their current credit score. Many people are in Fiat debt. Many people have their credit cards max out. Many people paying 18 - 28 % interest fees. For most people simply paying off their credit cards will show more gains in their bottom line than a coin they bought being shilled by a YouTuber.

I do think it would be hilarious if someone decided to keep mining the BCH8 fork and then they got in a fight over which fork is the ""real"" BCH.",1525617504

"Even as a store of value it’s become a huge risk.

Imagine a scenario where the blocks fill and fees soar. Then the price takes a huge dive. Now the selling frenzy goes even more haywire and people are just throwing money away trying to get their money out before BTC goes any lower.  This drives all miners away, exacerbating transaction issues and causing it all to continue to spiral.  

Meanwhile BCH is going up in price as people fervently switch out their coins to whatever they can via atomic swaps and exchanges.

"
&gt;* A merchant accepting crypto payments.  
&gt;At the moment, paying with crypto does not provide any usabily advantage over paying with fiat that's why no merchant ever had a significan share of their revenues coming from crypto. The UX is trash, and the alternatives' UX has never been better (if you know the three digits at the back of your card you don't even need to pull out your card to pay online if Chrome registered it).

Going ahead of your 'use cases' argument. Well, you just said what the problem is with crypto and there are projects that work on better UX for your average consumers. Also, there are lots of use cases where neither client nor service provider needs to hold any wallet or do transactions. You just narrow cryptos down to payments but that is only the tip of the iceberg. Feel free to ask for some examples. I don't want this to be a shilling post.

&gt;""But muh privacy"", outside of hardcore libertarians, very few people care enough about their privacy to ruin their UX for every online purchase. In this case, crypto **is not** a corner stone, it's just a ""fun to have"".

I agree. However it's the opposite of privacy as every transaction is stored on a public ledger. This is nice for auditing purposes for example. Also, you could trace every transaction for governments available to the public. 

&gt;* A company annoncing a partnership with a crypto  
&gt;First of all a partnership happens when both companies provide ressources towards a common goal. Most crypto ""partnerships"" are actually a company running a Proof of Concept with crypto.  
&gt;You will have adoption when you a company has a successful project **in production** with crypto. Until then, treat it as cheap PR from companies that want to look innovative or sell consulting hours to their clients.

Cryptos are in the early stages. Of course they need a product but it's helpful to have partnerships in advance which shows that big companies have trust in cryptos hence building partnerships.

&gt;* A company talking about future ""use cases"" using crypto.  
&gt;Crypto is still a solution in search of a problem, sometimes companies think they found a future problem.
&gt;Let me tell you something, companies struggle with their *existing* use cases. Finding the best technology for their current needs is a long, arduous process. Anticipating their needs 10 years from now and slamming a crypto tech on top of these needs saying ""this will be the solution"" is at best cheerleading and at worst a proof of crass incompetence (right Bosch ?).

So, I can give you the easiest examples: sending money! It's too slow to send money over the world at the current state. Also, there are fees attached to every transaction. Crypto solves this problem and is a huge improvement for companies. In the end, saving more money is the biggest goal for every company. Of course, this is only an example for money transfers. The use cases of crypto go far beyond that.

&gt;
&gt;* A bank opening a crypto trading desk  
&gt;Banks probably realized that some of their clients have high risk tolerance, and if journeymen traders can make money trading bitcoin, they shouldn't do too bad. It's not adoption, it's validating of crypto as a speculation vehicle.

I don't get that last point maybe due to me not being native in English.

How would bitcoin actually change the position of currency? Wouldnt it be possible for someone to hoard a vast majority of bitcoin and become the top 1% themselves? ,1525617089
"Well stated rebuttal.   Going forward I’m most excited that we will no longer need to engage in these debates about the best way to scale.  The reason these arguments and debates happen is that people have differing views on what is possible and what will happen in the future.  Before August 1st, many argued that BCH would die immediately as it was a faulty and misguided project from the start.  Today, that argument is gone.  

After May 15th there will no longer be debates about the dangers of bigger blocks and enabling op codes.  Those events will be in the past along with arguments against them.  Adoption is happening, development on the BCH block chain is happening.  New applications will roll out that the whole world can see and use themselves without having to trust different opinions on what is possible or not.  

To the trolls, I no longer debate with them.  All I say to hem is “May 15th” Because on that day they can see for themselves how BCH improves upon itself without any of the dire consequences predicted by trolls.  

This is not an emergency fork, nor a political fork away from different views on scaling.  This is a planned upgrade that is the beginning of an exciting future for Bitcoin.  Just the first of the 2 scheduled updates per year.

"As an American, 75% of my holdings are from mining, and my withdrawal technique is based on U.S. tax laws.

When I mine something, I am required to pay income tax on the dollar value of what I mine.  I am then required to pay capital gains taxes on the difference in value when I withdrawal it.

As as result I hold everything I mine for one full year.  Then I withdrawal it paying long term capital gains taxes.  That way my capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.

I could be like some people here and hold for years on end, but I'm very realistic about crypto.  It will never continue to just go up up up.  Eventually coins will die and stabilize.

"Roger, I think you're a good person.  I've followed along ever since I heard about this 'bitcoin jesus' who was another ancap.  A couple things to consider:

Bitcoin isn't about you, regardless of the extent people try to make it so.  To me, this sort of video feeds into the personality politics in a deconstructive way.  The more time spent on this sort of ego saving stuff, the more Bitcoin Cash is hamstrung to this petty narrative. Of course they lie and use character assassination, it's all they have.

Regular people, investors, actual users, exchanges, the whole infrastructure, none of them give a shit about these internal politics.  They don't give a fuck about anyone's feelings.  **There is absolutely nothing to gain by making it about you.**

Let me repeat that.  **There is absolutely nothing to gain from making this about you.**   I know it's affected you.  It would affect me too.  

I think you need to take a deep breath and just reflect on things.  Take some time off.  I mean seriously, take a few months off and enjoy your life.  You don't need to be the official spokesman of a decentralized currency.  You don't need to redeem yourself in the eyes of disingenuous people.

It's probably easier said than done when we're not the ones getting threatened with lawsuits and shit.  But I think you need to give it some time to pare down to being about the coins again.  Not the personalities.  Take care of yourself man.  Let go.  ",1525616989

"your comment doesn't address my absolutely true point - that it would have gone nowhere because there is no need for a store of value only.

your comment is also trying to put bitcoin as equivalent to gold - which is not a seat it has earned.  gold has been money for literally thousands of years, and currently enjoys a special seat as the currency of last resort, which is why central banks are full of it and have been net buyers of it for several years as well.  gold is valued because of human history and its being a part of the money system.  the last time gold was used as currency was the last time central banks bought tons of it to use it as their currency of last resort.

it's certainly on stronger ground than bitcoin - which has too much of it's value on hodl til lambo speculators vs. actual use and transactions.

"**Gaslighting**

Gaslighting is a form of manipulation that seeks to sow seeds of doubt in a targeted individual or in members of a targeted group, hoping to make them question their own memory, perception, and sanity. Using persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, and lying, it attempts to destabilize the target and delegitimize the target's belief.

Instances may range from the denial by an abuser that previous abusive incidents ever occurred up to the staging of bizarre events by the abuser with the intention of disorienting the victim. The term owes its origin to the 1938 Patrick Hamilton play Gas Light and its 1940 and 1944 film adaptations.

"How do you make money as a developer that just created an awesome app? The advertising model is the only option you have, but it only works for monopolies like Facebook and Google, and they are ready to copy and crush you at every turn. Also, advertising is proven to reduce engagement and retention in your app.

Currently, the incentives of developers and users are *misaligned*. The Facebook model is to EXTRACT as much value as possible from their users so they can sell to ad agencies.

Kin is a new monetization model that allows developers to get paid for how much they contribute to the ecosystem. If you adopt Kin in your app (with their 5 minute SDK), you get paid a daily reward from the Kin Rewards Engine based on the transaction volume of Kin in your app. Create inspiring earn and spend opportunities for your users and increase transaction volume, and get paid a larger percent of the daily payout.

Kin earned in one app can be spent in another app in the ecosystem. So for example, Kin is currently publicly patented with Unity to develop an SDK for Unity developers, as well as blackhawk so apps have access to 270+ major brands for gift cards. Imagine kids earning Kin in their Unity based game, and then turning around and spending it on Steam.

The developers gets paid, and the users have better experiences and opportunities to participate in an economy and create value. Everyone wins. This is because now the incentives are aligned.

Kik did an experiment with Kik Points for 2 and a half years, and it did 3-10 times the global transaction volume of Bitcoin.

I disagree. Spam was taken care of by the fee. The fee is set by the size of the transaction and the age of coins. If a miner is willing to accept the transaction then it is not spam. Spam does not exist. A valid transaction is a valid transaction. You do not have to be willing to pay hundreds of dollars in fees for an on chain transaction for it not to be spam. You do not have to use specific optimization methods in order for your transaction to not be spam. When we are accurate about the reasons for the blocksize max we better understand bitcoin. Bitcoin welcomes satoshi dice and memo. Bitcoin wants lots of low fee transaction when the network can handle blocks that size. Spam does not exist with the fees.,1525615304

Or those that have no counterarguments try to hand wave an smokescreen. I'll let readers decide which one you are doing.  

The link I provide gave detailed arguments and examples for three different ways that anyone can clearly understand that SegWit is a disguised hard fork and not a soft fork. You did not dispute any of them here.  

&gt; There are different types of blocks in the btc blockchain, right but that does not matter.  

Oh I see. So you admit SegWit added a ""type of block"" to Bitcoin, but still want to believe that it was only a soft fork, whereby only rules that already existed were to be made more restrictive? How is it possible to add a new block type through a real soft fork, then? What about the new SegWit transaction types?  

More importantly, whenever you see small blockers talk about blocks now, or chains of signatures, and refer to the non-SegWit clients that current clients are supposed to be backwards compatible with, which type of blocks are being discussed? Why is it never made clear?  

If you use the original definition of block that has always existed for Bitcoin and which is officially defined in the white paper, then older clients can no longer verify all transactions all the way back to the Genesis Block since SegWit has been activated. This is a central tenet to making Bitcoin trustless, and you claim ""The data that you use to calculate the hash doesnt matter""?

"I can recommend you ICX. It has several events planned that can give it nice boost plus it is a fundamentally strong coin. between COSS and BNB, I will go with just one of them, one exchange coin is enough and Binance has proven to be the leader. Binance Chain will be a game changer that will affect the whole market and BNB will become even more valuable.

"That conversation has been beaten around so many times you must be living under a rock if you don't know the reason. And no, it's not about Blockstream/AXA/Bilderberg, very shortly, it's to ensure Bitcoin can exist for a long time coming as a decentralised currency.

You are free to buy and use whatever crypto you want, including selling your mom for Bitconnect. That's not the problem. The problem comes when you start attacking Bitcoin throughout the media and more. That's when we fight back.

Lastly, if you paid more fire the fee than the beer, you didn't use Bitcoin in some time. Fees are pretty low now. Too low, actually. I want them to go sky high ASAP, but if your main interest is to buy beer and coffee, you'll never understand why.",1525612937
"All these people saying XBY is a scam. If that were the case, wouldn't it be in the best interest of the devs to pump the price higher than it is now?

They could have done that easily without being on the hook for something like patent pending status for their code.

That's my view of it. Personally, I have a lot of XBY. And IDGAF if it goes to 0 because it was a high risk, high reward gamble anyways; as is with crypto in general. The money I have in, I can afford to lose without blinking an eye.",1525612937
"So it sounds like you have problems that bitcoin couldn’t even help you with. 

As far as middle aged being ignorant that is funny.  I commented because it sounded like you didn’t understand what inflation is. Sorry I tried to cure you ignorance. Yes, not everyone does research but I do and so far Bitcoin appears as valuable as dreams.  All I hear in response as to why it is exists is FUD.

When you ask a basic question about a technology and it can’t be broken down into a simple answer, then somebody either doesn’t understand it enough themselves to explain it or they are scamming you. 

Bitcoin is mainly a technology. The value assigned to the coin is completely arbitrary. When all the bitcoins are mined what will happen?  I can only foresee everyone flocking to “Son of Bitcoin” whatever that is and driving up the value of that. There is no magic to bitcoin.  Just the “Brand recognition” Block chain can be replicated. So the value of coins will fall when the bubble finally bursts and people move on to the next big thing. 

No one has adequately explained the problem bitcoin is trying to solve. And that is the key to any technologies success. Solve a problem more efficiently until a better solution comes along. 

So far, the only problem I see bitcoin solving is possibly cheaper currency exchange. 

It won’t solve inflation, it won’t end banking, it won’t end human misery. 

If you see something else perhaps you can explain in a simple way?

Until then any bitcoins bought should only be purchased for speculation(money you can afford to lose). Don’t put your rent money into it (unless landlord requires payment in it). 

My only concern is not to see you get burned in a  bad investment my friend. It’s very easy to get excited and loose sight of the risks. But if you only play with money you can afford to lose then you may make out. 



",1525612923
"Think that's what Revolut is doing to an extent. Fees are higher than traditional exchanges, but you can get crypto from fiat instantly. Higher cost is leveraged on not having to wait 3 to 5 days waiting for a SEPA transfer to arrive, by which time you have missed a lot of action. Many more banks/companies to enter the fray. OTC in the US soon. ",1525612895

"**Pearson correlation coefficient**

In statistics, the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC, pronounced ), also referred to as Pearson's r, the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (PPMCC) or the bivariate correlation, is a measure of the linear correlation between two variables X and Y. It has a value between +1 and −1, where 1 is total positive linear correlation, 0 is no linear correlation, and −1 is total negative linear correlation. It is widely used in the sciences. It was developed by Karl Pearson from a related idea introduced by Francis Galton in the 1880s.

"Not selling even 10&amp;#37; when you had already achieved 2000&amp;#37; growth was a ridiculously bad idea. Learn from this, and know, that markets don't just go up for infinity. Next ATH for the love of god pull out something you're not trying to impregnate the crypto world with your money. No babies will come out it'll just eat it all up and you'll be broke. The entire thing is likely to fail across the board leaving a few powerful stragglers that will be adopted by the world. Right now is the only time retards can make money with shitcoins\(not saying you're a retard OR that your HODLings are shitcoins, but you get my point\). Good luck sir! 

I invest $800, then sold 10&amp;#37; at ATH, then I bought 4 mining rigs \(3 ETH beasts and 1 LTC antminer\), and I sold 1 of them for more than I paid after mining about $300 with it \(30 days\), and now I have 3 rigs making $600/month at current much lower market prices and way more than $800 in my bank AND 90&amp;#37; of my HODLings. My friend suggested that I actually sell 50&amp;#37; instead of 10, which at the time I didn't know was ATH, but if I had listened this entire story would have x10 by most of the things I said I bought.

"That’s taken from a section on how to use Bitcoin with respect to Ethereum.  Essentially it’s a description of the ability to create a smart contract to peg a token to the price of Bitcoin.  Certainly not an “admission” of anything like what you’re claiming.

Just above that section on the page is the far more pertinent: 

“Ethereum would never be possible without bitcoin—both the technology and the currency—and we see ourselves not as a competing currency but as complementary within the digital ecosystem. Ether is to be treated as ""crypto-fuel"", a token whose purpose is to pay for computation, and is not intended to be used as or considered a currency, asset, share or anything else.”

I would rather give away 1 bitcoin than have to go to Birmingham New Street...,1525612273
No I was correct on short-term time frame.  Alts were the place to be until BTC tried 10k and failed and I made good money.  If you look at my comments later in day I called exactly what we got.  I tether at 9950 and believe we're headed to 9k long term.,1525612273
Yea but whales see this and there's going to be an effect on the market. The same thing happened with tether. So much fud about tether about how they are going to crash bitcoin caused bitcoin to fall,1525612261
"We tried that.  The first client that could accept larger blocks, Bitcoin XT, was deemed an alt-coin by Core, DDOS'd, and was the start of censorship on r/bitcoin.

Coinbase simply stated that they were testing XT, and the Core community got our the pitchforks to attack them.  This prevented any other services from announcing support for big blocks for the remaining years of the debate.

Bitcoin Unlimited supported signaling for larger blocks, and miners could indicate the size they would be willing to accept as well as the size they would create (emergant concensus).  This gained support of 45% of the miners, while 30% signaled for SegWit, and the other miners did not signal either.

These voting ratios did not change until the New York Agreement, where miners agreed to support SegWit only if they would get a block size increase (2x).  Signaling support jumped to over 90%.

Unfortunately, the NYA activated SegWit and then 3 months later the 2x.  Once they got SegWit, the 2x part of the agreement was rejected by the small-block side.  The 2x code didn't even work (intentional or not is highly questionable), and would have failed anyway.  Anyway, they got SegWit.

What they were not counting on was a vocal minority to fork to get larger blocks before SegWit activation.  Thus, Bitcoin Cash was born.

"How does Coinbase (I pick them because of their institution like focus) continue to support Bitcoin Cash. 

I don’t mind forked coins at all and support that. But Bitcoin Cash continually cheating and lying while knowingly tricking people is beyond me. Everyone is aware what they are doing, even at institutional level. 

I enjoy using Coinbase due to its ease and simplicity. However **I’m going to stop using them and find another provider**. 

In many ways Coinbase legitimised BCH by adding them to their exchange while not considering any other fork or coin. We know that was an error and in hindsight they should too. I cannot continue to consider Coinbase a professional business with this mind, not when there are other coins that are legitimate and doing good work. 

Something needs to change and I will be moving from exchanges and not using providers who support BCH due to their known clear manipulation and cons. ",1525612153
crypto shit usually pumps up till the day before or day of.. from what ive seen. one example being verge.,1525612143
What if his research indicates that some other crypto will likely be the leader over BTC and BCH?

This couldn't have happened any better for Bitcoin.  There was **always** going to be a highly contentious fork in the network that would leave 2 or more chains alive, at least for a while.

However once we obtained all the necessary legal documents and submitted them to the Coinbase dropbox via email they stopped communicating with us altogether.  We smell a rat.  We do not have proof but we are thinking that possibly someone at coinbase cashed our one bitcoin when it got up around 20,000 recently thinking nobody was going to claim it since it had been 2 years since our brother passed.  I send a request to them on a daily basis with a copy to the CEO and they completely ignore it.  Like I said we definitely smell a rat and are preparing to contact the California Attorney General's office.   I have no proof that it has been stolen but something is definitely awry. ",1525611778

You’ve hit the nail on the head with what I realised I’ve done. I cashed out ahead in the dip with the plan to buy lower because I was thinking about fiat. Truth is I will have to pay more money now than I paid in the first place just to have the same amount of BTC I started with because I bought lower.

"The mitigation of this ""poison block"" attack, however, must not be arbitrary max block size limits in consensus code, not in a way that castrates economics of monetary system limiting available transaction space.

The mitigation should be in configuration parameters for mining software, so that every miner on his own or in consensus with other miners could configure their software to not build on top of whatever at any given moment they deem as a ""poison block.""

On protocol consensus level there should not be not should ever have been any limit on block size at all. The only real reason for keeping it on protocol level is a power grab and establishing a rent seeking position by an actual attacker using advanced social engineering strategy, that should from now on to be known as a **""Gore Attack""**.

What Gore is enforcing on poor BTC chain is cyanide as cure for a potential headache. The patient is already clearly dying from this ""cure"" but they still insist on continuing taking cyanide pills.

Anyway, probably the most misunderstood feature of Bitcoin is that it can and it will mutate and route around the damage like the one caused by the ""Gore attack"". Bitcoin Cash is a living proof of that.

"There are other potential solutions, such as sidechains, which can enable separate ledgers from the main Bitcoin chain, but share the currency. The big issue with sidechains is that miners could potentially mis-allocate funds when transferring them between chains. Miners who mine the main chain should not need to be concerned with sidechains, but they ultimately need to verify transactions coming from the sidechain back to the main chain, or the miners themselves could misappropriate the funds by sending them to a different address.

There's been a number of ideas to try to prevent this. Perhaps the best so far is Paul Sztorc's Drivechains, where transactions coming back from a sidechain onto the main-chain must undergo a kind of ""race"" towards a goal over a period of 3 months, where miners on the main chain should advance a transaction from a sidechain toward the goal faster than a collaborating group of dishonest miners could push a fake transaction to spend the funds (with the fallback of a UASF before funds are misappropriated, but this itself vulnerable to sybil attacks).

If anyone could *solve* the sidechain problem, it would be technically possible to run any other cryptocurrency technology as a sidechain, such that they share the base currency. (For example, you could have a version of Etherium which exists as a sidechain). Sidechains could have arbitrary rules, because the rules don't touch the main chain. The currency on a sidechain doesn't necessarily need to have the same monetary value as Bitcoin on the main chain either.

LN can arguably achieve the same kind of thing with cross-chain atomic swaps. Since everyone compares the current price of their cryptocurrency to Bitcoin's anyway, Bitcoin would still be the main chain as a kind of global currency standard, with other cyptocurrencies offering what sidechains were posed to offer. This is why most effort has been put towards developing the lightning network over sidechains, under the assumption that other currencies will provide the basic functions needed to do the kind of HTLCs needed for atomic swaps.

LN shouldn't just be considered a ""Bitcoin layer 2"", because it really goes beyond Bitcoin. It will be the primary medium for exchange of cryptocurrencies (since you don't need trust in atomic swaps, as you need on exchanges now).",1525610302

In the 1980s, the Amiga was arguably the best PC/Operating system available, but they didn't manage to keep up with the hardware that became available (80386) like Microsoft, who managed to gain the market majority as PCs became mainstream. Also, even though Linux is successful in that it is installed on far more devices than any other Kernel, a significant portion of those devices are Anrdoid devices, which offers a crippled version of Linux for Google to push their information-harvesting services. I wouldn't necessarily call that a success.

There's the danger that people will just run with ""electronic cash"", and not pay interest to the most important aspects like privacy, censorship-resistance, and trustlessness. If the institutions they already use and ""trust"" offer them ""electronic cash"", and it's convenient for them, they'll just go with it and not be concerned about the things that give Bitcoin its meaningful value.

Honestly, LN needs to be convenient to use, which it isn't at present. This is more important than the implementation details. Ideally we want to preserve all the most important ideas of Bitcoin and be convenient.

For LN to succeed, there must be exchanges that will automatically load up channels with funds for you, there needs to be mobile wallets which don't need to be always online, there needs to be multi-party channels built into it and not just the 2-party channels it offers now, and merchants need to adopt it. All this needs to happen sooner rather than later or Bitcoin will miss out on the incoming masses of users who'll go for something more convenient, where they need to trust 3rd parties, or lose their economic privacy.",1525608715

"&gt;I know how IOTA works. You do not. I'm sorry.

&gt;IOTA requires a PoW when creating a transaction. And for the network to be secure this way, the network has to have sufficient hash power. It does not remove the need for this computation.

Did I in some point claim that IOTA would not require PoW? What I said is that it is not horribly wasteful like Bitcoin and other legacy coins.

The whole point about the solution that IOTA is creating, is that they are coming up with a way where it is not only about who can waste the most computing power.

So yes PoW is included, but at totally different levels compared to for example Bitcoin.

&gt;No, you just don't understand it. It's not trivial. Even PoS-based mechanisms are NOT trivial.

??? I wrote ""just a bit untrivial"" which is a way of saying something is NOT trivial, as in pretty damn impossible.

But this discussion is getting pointless. Relying on enormous waste of computing power to ""secure network"" is a totally boneheaded concept, and it is something that is going away.

"The only way someone could claim this would be if they forked from BCH and then gained most POW. BTC is not bitcoin since it often has high fees, slow confirmations, and lacks censorship resistance, so even though it has most POW, it is not bitcoin by definition... so forking from BTC would not make something bitcoin even if it gained most POW. Bitcoin is a continuous chain of signatures that follows the definition of a bitcoin whose Genesis block was January, 2009. BCH is the only one in which this is true and has the longest POW for whatever coin follows this definition.

Now, to answer your question... if someone forked BCH and then gained most POW, it would then be bitcoin. For example, on May 15, BCH is going to hardfork. When the upgrade chain gains most POW, it will then be bitcoin even if some miner continue mining the rules before the upgrade. The only way it becomes bitcoin is if it originated in January 2009, has the properties of a bitcoin, and the longest POW chain.",1525608527

It got tons of upvotes and when I questioned whether any of its criticisms actually had any merit I got downvoted.  reddit is, sadly, not an intelligent or critical community when it comes to crypto, and this is just another example.  

Oh and another ""reason"" was the Skyminer distribution, where you pay 1BTC for $600 worth of hardware and get the rest in SKY (which you can immediately sell to recoup your costs).

If the encryption is broken, they can switch algos, but all the previous transactions will forever be traceable.

"Hoping some of you guys can share some insight on this.

When I first started crypto, it was all about the $ value, and I'd buy and sell for little profits here and there. As I began to understand the technology, application, and implication of cryptocurrency on the future, I started to focus less on the $ value of my coins and more on accumulating a larger stack of BTC/ETH. 

By setting very conservative buy and sells, I've slowly started to grow my BTC/ETH stack. As crazy as the market is, and after getting burned a couple of times, there are certain patterns that reoccur. By capitalizing on those, I've been able to ever so slowly increase my stack.

I absolutely believe in global adoption of cryptocurrency in the future. I also don't believe that BTC and ETH will be dethroned in the near future \(the remainder of 2018\). However, I do believe that there will be a coin or network somewhere down the line that seriously disrupts the dominance of BTC and ETH.

A growing concern is that BTC/ETH value is heavily tied to the fact that exchanges currently do not offer fiat/alt coin pairings.

I read the daily discussions every so often, and it's clear that a lot of you have also stopped thinking of your coins in $ value and instead in satoshis. 

My question is if there's anything we can do to leverage our BTC/ETH value in the event that something seriously devalues  BTC/ETH \(such as fiat/alt pairings being readily available\).

8)Not exactly. Bitcoin XT did not reach majority support to be activated as Bitcoin upgrade. Neither did other attempts like Bitcoin Classic or Bitcoin Unlimited.

"**TLDR**  (article is bullish)

Crypto **is** the future, but for it to take over, it will have to destroy all the trash that our current financial system has caused. Compare it to a forest fire. It is a natural occurrence and greatly beneficial to the ecosystem. It wipes away a majority of the flora, fauna, etc in order to grow back much better and stronger. In his post, he writes

&gt; At all of these interfaces, the seams were sharp enough to cause a terrible rip in the fabric of the world economy, and winter came in the form of global depressions to wipe away the old leaves and dead wood. Cryptocurrency will be the death knell of the government/military age, because it takes government out of controlling the money. There will be a new money with millions of new overseers and a free market that replaces the dominance of small cabals of government bureaucrats who dictate the terms of commerce in the world.


*We* will be the millions of new overseers after all the dust is settled from the next 'great depression' that crypto causes.


&gt;The best thing about economic depressions is that the greatest transfers of wealth - usually from the haves to the have nots - occur in these times.


*We* will be the ones apart of this massive wealth transfer - it's just going to be a bumpy ride to mass adoption.

You're admitting you don't understand it, yet you claim ""facts"".

The most important part of securing a decentralized cryptocurrency is the ability to write history that cannot be changed. And signatures are not even applied to blocks, not that it is relevant.

If you wanted to change history in Bitcoin you would need mining power close to half of the network hash power. In IOTA you would need hash power comparable with hash power of all nodes making transactions (ie. rate of transactions). IOTA with the current PoW model would need to waste the same resources as Bitcoin to reach similar level of security.

If you do not understand why Bitcoin or IOTA needs this hash power, you should maybe consider not writing posts about it and spread misinformation.",1525605308

Yes, keeping the ""potential pool"", as you say, as wide and as easy accessible as possible is crucial here.

If that possibility is there, big hubs won't have as much (or any) power. It's exactly the same as with the bitcoin protocol itself. No one can censor you, or stop your transaction, if you run your own full node. If you cannot run your full node, you gotta trust some other full node, which then has a certain degree of power over your transactions.",1525605132

"Apologies, I missed that link. So CSW seems to be saying in context  that having businesses and governments and anyone with the financial means to run mining nodes should be encouraged. That is very different than handing over the commit keys to the protocol. I am not sure if that is what you meant but those are 2 different kinds of ""running"" running a node and running the entire show are different. Though realistically if the gov of China or the US or Russia started buying mining equipment in bulk whether it be asics or gpus it wouldnt make any difference in the end game as long as they have the majority of hashing power. Banning ASICS isnt going to change anything in that regard other than limiting the chances of a national take over being fewer countries...if that is your main concern. 

You are correct that the problem I cited was in 2013 while the client was not renamed until 2014. But that does not change my point that even beloved bitcoin had bumps along the way at its start.. some may argue they are not yet finished. 
Colored coins is similar to lightning in that it is a second layer in which micro-transactions could be processed of the main chain for the most part relieving congestion which of course is not an issue for BCH at the moment.
We will just have to agree to disagree that only mining nodes(pools) matter. With EDA a big loss in mining power due to say China cracking down isn't much of an issue with BCH. Though it may result in chain death for BTC so I understand your concerns there. Though as more and more of the economy moves to crypto the chances of a global crack down get smaller.

Yes, the LN path-finding algorithm would automatically seek alternative routes, of which there should be plenty, as the network grows and branches out. Also, you always can manually disconnect from the malicious hub (if you are connected directly), or from its peers, and open new channels to non-malicious nodes.  

I haven't seen any in-depth discussions on that regard yet though. But as long as everyone can run their full node, the network can stay permissionless and censorship resistant. It's the same as in bitcoin, tbh. Not everyone will run a full node, obviously, but the fact that it's possible and the fact that many people do, acts as protection from censorship. ",1525604113

Just wait some days... alts will outgrow btc and eth soon again. ,1525603486

"&gt; Also, while I'm here... I've been asking this around: The curent ETH right now is a fork from ETC, right? How did they earn the ETH name? Why did ETC get to be the one with the extension in the name? How is this fork similar/different to the BTC/BCH fork? [Honestly want to know. I do my own research but as a new comer, it can get really difficult and I feel like getting the answer to this question will help.]

It wasn't widely foreseen or publicly planned (that I knew of) that the non-forked chain would even continue to be mined at all, let alone traded on exchanges. So the exchanges mostly just followed the fork, and continued to call it 'Ethereum'. It was Poloniex, who first listed ETC to the surprise of many people (including me). Others then had to support it, as otherwise their customers would have accused them of stealing their money.

ETC ended up as not much else than a short-lived pump-and-dump, although the ETC/ETH ratio did reach about 0.33 IIRC. It didn't get much support apart from trading and shilling (by Barry Silbert among others). Chandler Guo tried to make it ""the Ethereum for China"", but that didn't work out that well in the end. I think the lack or poor quality of developer support finally sealed the deal for ETC.

BCH seems to have much more continuous and increasing support from the industry, developers and crypto community than ETC. For ETC there were a lot of promises, but it quickly went downhill.",1525603434
This is getting confusing... I'm asking for people to tell me why this video is wrong and you're saying that unless people fully understand lightning network they should not even use BTC?,1525603404
"&gt;Prove it.

You got me, 0.01 of computing power needed is way too much.

Technically what you need is computing needed for applying signatures. Typically Bitcoin uses around 30. A typical desktop CPU can do 100s if not thousands of signature operations per second. 

So 0.01 is in fact way too much.

&gt;Those two thing have nothing in common.

Oh, there are tons of people who say that mining is needed for rarity and thus coin price. I don't surbscribe to that thought, but a lot of people believe in it.

&gt;IOTA is currently secured by a centralized element, so irrelevant. Also they have not yet shown that their network is secure without needing the combined hash power of all nodes being somewhere near Bitcoin mining hash power.

They are also using experimental hash functions, and coordinator is also for corporate use cases.",1525603364

because it is what happened, Bitcoin Cash forked off Bitcoin - i get the point you are trying to make, but your argument is flawed, segwit/LN are a soft fork, a code upgrade within the same development repo/project of BItcoin, if you want to make the argument that it isn't following the whitepaper then sure, I agree that it is more aligned with the whitepaper on the scaling solution with big(ger) blocks - however Bitcoin Cash was a *hard fork* a direct fork of the Bitcoin project into a new development project/repo (i refer to repo since they're both contained with github) called *Bitcoin Cash*, with the aim of keeping with the big(ger) block scaling solution which is different to that of segwit/LN making BCH's scaling solution different than BTC making my point 100% factual and void of opinion. *buuu^u^u^u^t*, just because it may follow the scaling solution closer, it does not make it Bitcoin you still have consensus aswell as the actual act of a hard fork voiding it of being within the original Bitcoin project

i have no issue with Bitcoin Cash and am very interested to see how it plays out as the blocks get bigger and if crypto adoption gets bigger, fuller with tx's - which will tell me if my hesitations about big blocks are true or not. but i do see a fee-less coin system taking the main spot above BTC and BCH in adoption and world use.

"Definitely read the other more detailed answers. Here's a short summary:

The Bitcoin chain split into two in August 2017 - BCH and BTC.

* BTC adds huge illogical changes to the code and totally changes the idea that lead to what Bitcoin has become. BTC is supported by the /r/bitcoin dictators, thus by the newbies that believe their manipulation.

* BCH doesn't change a thing. It makes sure things keep working the way they did before, by letting blocks get bigger, as it has always been.

The best thing about BCH, in my opinion, is that the community is not censored. It probably doesn't seem that important at first glance, but the BTC censorship has lead to horrible outcomes. It's the single thing that let Blockstream use the name Bitcoin BTC for their chain that doesn't represent the Bitcoin idea. I think it's the biggest thread against Bitcoin. ",1525598266
"Most probably not satoshi xDD

The term blockchain is actually not in whitepaper, even tho u imply that.

""Chain of blocks"" is in there once, but you are probably refering to:

""We define an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures. Each owner transfers the coin to the
next by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next owner
and adding these to the end of the coin. A payee can verify the signatures to verify the chain of
ownership.""

This is not defining a blockchain, but basically bitcoin (or electronic coins that work like bitcoin)!

The chain of signatures is what is neccessary to get the current UTXO set and which is basically the information about the funds everyone is able to spend. 

Those signatures were/are saved in the blockchain, which he did not define in the above statement!",1525598264

"**Store of value**

A store of value is the function of an asset that can be saved, retrieved and exchanged at a later time, and be predictably useful when retrieved. More generally, a store of value is anything that retains purchasing power into the future.

The most common store of value in modern times has been money, currency, or a commodity like a precious metal or financial capital. The point of any store of value is risk management due to a stable demand for the underlying asset.

If you want to claim that BTC is the real Bitcoin because BCH forked off in another direction (which is what you seem you want to imply) then no, you are not correct, because the scaling of BCH is exact same as original Bitcoin, which only leaves BTC being the one that forked off in different direction with different scaling option, which started off with SegWit, and now going even further away, with completely different system, which is Lightning.

LTC is not a good coin by any measure. It is a copy of BTC with the same dysfunctional scaling plan. If LTC hits high volumes it will have the same problems BTC has. 0-conf won't work and those 2.5m blocks won't help either. 

BCH though will always have 0-conf, reliable and secure confirmations.

"You are entitled to your opinion.  Personally, I think ""which is the original vision"" is the wrong question.  2nd layer abilities were built into btc from the start, intentionally, as was the ability to increase blocksize.  Nakamoto consensus on the chain accepted segwit, leading the project toward LN.  BCH forked, but only after consensus of blocksize increases were largely ignored.  Some think it was too soon to add a micropayments layer and more time was needed with blocksize increases.  Others believe blocksize increases are secondary to adding the new layer.  This is not as binary an issue as many make it out to be.  The chain that wins will have better scalability and/or security and/or network effect.  Atm, BTC has network effect, which is why it has a larger base supporting it, and a headstart.  As for security and scalability, I've heard arguments for both, and while I have my own assumptions, only time will tell.  Also, Ver and Jihan are pretty scummy, regardless of how one feels about BCH.  BCH would do well to distance itself from those two.

BCH being an altcoin heavily depends on your definition. LTC being a fork of the code is not a fork of the chain, that is clearly an altcoin. BCH being a fork of the original Bitcoin blockchain, sharing most of it's history with BTC, is a *fork* not an altcoin, by my definition.

Also, while I'm here... I've been asking this around: The curent ETH right now is a fork from ETC, right? How did they earn the ETH name? Why did ETC get to be the one with the extension in the name?

The 1MB cap was put in place temporarily because Bitcoin was nearly worthless and mining was done by amateurs thus it was easy for someone with no skin in the game to make a nuisance block, BUT as capacity approaches the cap, the cap itself opens a new attack vector where the attacker can degrade user experience severely by outbidding transactions in already full blocks.

BCH would have to rise from 1.0 to, say, or 1.4 during the difficulty period to start causing problems.

"i've been a casual observer off to the side for a long time but here's how i see it:

1. bitcoin is a crypto currency.  it's not *just* a store of value, and if it was launched that way, would have no traction.  bitcoin achieves store of value as a feature of being used as currency.
2. currencies gain true organic purchasing power by being used for transactions.
3. i'm not sure if wide adoption scaling can be done solely on chain or if it will require an off chain solution.  i do know adoption is where it gets value - not speculative HODLing.
4. BTC seems to have made technical choices and economic ones to try and state, best case, bitcoin is a store of value now, and some day, a medium of exchange.  mostly when LN is ready.
5. this has resulted in the biggest sin i see then - harming adoption.
6. LN itself seems to be complex and have a lot of technical challenges.
7. in the mean time, BCH is chooching along with original plans, and seeking widespread adoption.

so,

if LN became amazeballs tomorrow, i would expect BTC to do well and BCH to crash and burn, the latter offering no superior solution.

however

if it takes LN 2 years before it's ready for 'prime time' - and in particular if it can be easily made to work with BCH anyway - and over those 2 years BTC adoption became stagnant and BCH adoption climbed, then i fully expect BCH to win.

by adoption i mean merchants and peer transactions taking place.  not speculative fomo HODLing.",1525593592

"Bitcoi  transactions are identified by their hash. This is slightly problematic in that in order generate that hash you need to have the full contents of the transaction - including the witness data that can be used to prove the transaction itself to be valid. This is no big deal for fully validating clients who want to share the transactions to other clients as they need the full data anyway, but it is suboptimal for clients who either only want to validate or SPV clients willing to trust the majority hash rate to validate transaction and simply need a reliable way to identify transactions.

Compared to the rest of a transaction, witness data tends to be _big_. By segregation that data, such that it only indirectly contributes to the transaction ID, non-archival and SPV clients are alleviated of the requirement to store or download, respectively, the bulky witness data when it is unnecessary for their chosen security profile. As evidence of the witness data is still included through the witness commitment in the coinbase transaction, miners and other fully validating clients can still ensure that transactions are properly signed.

u/cryprorebel's claim that Segwit only embeds the witness data via reference to it's merkle tree is correct.  However, that's same way witness data is recorded sans Segwit. If we are to believe this invalidates the coins-as-chain-of-digital-signatures concept, then we must acknowledge that bitcoin never fulfilled that concept in the first place. Alternatively, the assertion is built on a false premise, rooted in a misinterpretation of the concept and how it is implented in bitcoin. That is to say, Segwit cannot remove signatures from the chain and replace them with hashes because that's all that ever was recorded in the first place.

I’m concerned that all we’ve done is reinforce the idea to people they should dump BTC at something like $9950,1525591396
"Some people call BTC Bitcoin, and some people call BCH Bitcoin. 

Due to the confusion this can cause, when talking about the two side by side its useful to say Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Cash. ",1525591344
Yeh it’s gonna be very interesting. Create THE shitcoin and sway the public sheep with media and news. Replace empty bank notes with digital bs. Fkn government. BTC should be the currency.,1525591244
"Yes, everything that is not Bitcoin. So for me, Ethereum &amp; Bitcoin Cash are altcoins. ",1525591211
I get paid in btc for managing a crypto discord group. Not much but its a kind gesture from the owner ,1525591134
"mine was in 2013, traded some TF2 items on tremorgames and saw they had BTC.",1525591129
This is the new Vault Logic ATM at the Atlanta Bitcoin Embassy,1525591084
"LTC did not improve anything aside from helping some to avoid high fees on BTC. It’s a transitional coin, BCH is being used currently for the same purpose, but everyday there is more and more adoption and products coming out supporting BCH because of the fact it actually works the way Bitcoin should be working, which isn’t the way BTC is currently operating as ",1525591080

"Well you just proved that your logic is flawed massively.

It is not possible that BCH forked off with its own scaling solution, BCH uses Bitcoin scaling solution. Its the BTC that forked off in different direction.

Sorry but, your logic sucks.",1525590997
Wow hadn't realised BCH had made up so much ground. I have good feelings about Bitcoin Cash - a shame it is taking so long to gain momentum but steady and slow wins the race...,1525590920
What did you enjoy creating more? Bitcoin or Tesla,1525590909
"If you don't see this and you are not Core's minion, I would have to say that you are misguided or if your opinion is not based on someone else's flawed logic or deliberate attempt to create propaganda, which Core and their minions have been doing, then you would have to have flawed logic also. Your flawed logic could be based on lack of full history and understanding of Bitcoin.",1525590900
"Why in earth name do I want to invest in something that needs fraud to brand it self by a name it clearly isent. I dont have a any issues against BCH. I am trader, not a fanboy of any crypto. But trying to claim pepsi is the true cola is just retarded..",1525590866
"The argument is not wether BTC is or is not currently considered the Bitcoin. 

It's weather it **should** be.

* It deviates from the original vision and plan of the Bitcoin in a way that is ad odds with the intended use-cases (peer-to-peer cash).
* It held on to the name due to broken agreements, censorship and misinformation.",1525590863
"BTC dominance is the dumbest measure of bitcoin's success or measure of anything. Of course as new coins enter the market it will reduce BTC's dominance. The more orange juice I pour into my vodka, the less vodka dominance in my screw driver.  

So. Fucking. Stupid.   ",1525590832
Yes that also true. Many institutions will buy privately but not all of them can. Don’t worry crypto will MEWN! But it won’t be mass parabolic like we saw for a while. Eventually it will. ,1525590824

"No BTC developer can even be pinned down to quantify what they mean by a ""block"" on the BTC block chain anymore, and there's a very simple reason for this. If you examine a SegWit ""block"" and compare it with blocks as they've always been in Bitcoin's earlier 8.5 year history, it quickly becomes obvious that SegWit was really a [disguised hard fork](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7tnrvu/nist_report_confirms_bitcoin_is_a_fork_and/dte32ht/), not a soft fork as claimed.

How exactly do these work? Do you give your crypto address &amp; scan your id??,1525590628
"Because ""btc dominance"" is measured by pitting BTC against every other coin which is an asinine comparison. ",1525590620
Yep I understand. I bought the original bitcoin in 2013. Currently it's trading nomenclature is BTC. Right? ,1525590605
"&gt; BCH is BTC

No one thinks that. Bitcoin is an idea that BCH represents the most today. BTC is no longer Bitcoin. BCH doesn't want to be BTC. Exactly the opposite, it wants to be Bitcoin. ",1525590496

I live in a small city in Canada and we have about a dozen or more Bitcoin ATMs.  Definitely not rare in Canada.,1525590381
"This is the consequence of btc failing as a currency. If it was used as a currency, policy makers would see that taxing it and treating it as just an asset is ridiculous. Also if people used it as a currency, govs couldnt take it down easily whereas now they can target exchanges and chashing out points.",1525590381
so BTC is not the ticker for Bitcoin?,1525590357
"&gt; Don't spend Bitcoin, if you want something, just buy it.

With what?  Fiat currency?  Why would I have any of that available when bitcoin is better in every way?",1525590333
You do understand that the name BTC  is just a trading   nomenclature right? It has nothing to do with the technology or the ledger. This seems to be the main point of confusion for a lot of core supporters. They can't differentiate between the actual tech and the trading. ,1525590312
Alts will die before BTC becomes obsolete.,1525590139
