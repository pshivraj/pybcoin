TL;DR: Chief Architect Greg Maxwell pulled out the ""champaign"" to celebrate the robust fee market, just before opining on how to move even more transactions into SegWit and off-chain to support the users:

"It will crash hard most likely just because it's going to moon hard. Like you said it's backed by google so it'll probably 1000X....You can't 1000x without any actual revenues generated. Unless their revnues go up by that much. 

But it'll crash to a level still higher than the original price by far I'm sure. Like how 8000 btc is higher than 1000 last year January. ",1526799542
"Except it isnt a subjective thing. They failed in gaining majority of the consensus, in which they are free to fork off to create their own coin, sure.

But do you think the community hates Bitcoin Cash just because their an altcoin? Why arent all the other currencies and forks getting the same hate? Its simple. The ring leader of Bitcoin Cash has been constantly trying to push people into believing that his coin is Bitcoin. From propaganda on bit.coin.com to the twitter handle, you're tell me that the hate is subjective?

They are one and the same. Some a little bigger then others, but all are forks which failed to get the majority to embrace their changes. ",1526799540
"Dunno if I qualify as an ""old timer"", does 2013 count.  Anyways, I tend to agree that, because of the fork, I no longer worry about which vision for Bitcoin is going to win out and the implications of that for its survival.

I have to take exception to the idea that the Core/Segwit fork has a sole claim to the long track record of Bitcoin.  Both forks have altered Bitcoin and have some claim to that track record, though I do think the BCH changes are more in line with the original system.

Also, I disagree that Bitcoin was designed to incur delays.  The purpose of the system is to move transactions into blocks to secure them.  Having transactions sitting in the mem pool for expended periods is counter to this purpose.

"Also a false dichotomy, costs more to build an iOS app vs Android, yet Apple is worth more? Whilst this may be a factor, it's a minimal one. You can build an app on Neo now, you can't on EOS yet. Given that there are platforms \(including Ethereum\) which have proven that they can support an ecosystem of Dapps, in a more rational market, they would be worth more \(based on the utility of the Dapps\). However crypto is quite irrational in the sense that because there are a limited number of proven cases of mass adoption, most people are still speculating on which ones will gain adoption.

Once we reach the stage where we can measure the utility of a project \(active users, transaction volumes, transaction frequency, ticket sizes etc.\) rather than the trading utility \(exchange volumes etc.\) then we will have more objective measurements.",1526799427

"They're really not the same.

There's been a huge scaling debate within Bitcoin since 2015. I could talk about it at length, but the basic points are: Satoshi put the 1MB blocksize cap just in case someone wanted to spam and bloat the blockchain because transactions were absolutely free. When he gave the project to Gavin, he told him to raise it at some point. Well, he tried with Mike Hearn with Bitcoin XT, and the censorship on /r/bitcoin and shady shit started happening. Long story short, the big blockers were never given a proper platform and were shunned about even discussing their ideas. Segwit2x was the last hope for a compromise between the two camps, and even that failed. Much more detailed summary here: https://hackernoon.com/the-great-bitcoin-scaling-debate-a-timeline-6108081dbada 

Why does the history matter? Because that same hostility against big blockers is STILL happening.

Bitcoin Cash finally split the camps and now there are two different Bitcoins that have different scaling solutions. Saying Diamond and Gold (while still versions of Bitcoin, yes) are the same is just false, look at the community behind Bitcoin Cash and all of the new developments happening. 

The scaling debate is now in the markets. Some people think 'the one true bitcoin' is BTC, others BCH, even some others BTG. It's really just a subjective thing.

"casper is the [most centralized PoS ever](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereumfraud/comments/7djclm/casper_masternode_pos_variant_to_use_70_premined/) possibly, but it's designed by the worst dev team ever in this space so not surprise.

casper weights by wealth rewarding those who premined even further than was enough for past censorship and state edits, punishes honest dissent, makes attacks on dissenting chains trivial, and thanks to pareto will lead to a couple of nodes you can never vote out in control only getting richer.

millions of voters on eos control the network and delegate far more efficiently to more evenly weighted nodes, firing any that misbehave.

there's not a single decentralized aspect to ethereum, and other than using an ico (possibly the most secure ico distribution model ever) has far more decentralized design than is ever possible on centralized eth. dpos is known for inventing dao's, for approval voting, for nearly infinite money at stake for producers, something at stake for voters, for fastest confirms, and for lowest fees.

"It sucks really, because as Satoshi designed BTC, who ever had the largest chain would adopt the BTC name. He was very open to the idea that Bitcoin would continue to change, drastically. Over time The Bitcoin that started would be a faint memory of the much better Bitcoin that is. 

However, BCH, while it was a great change to Bitcoin and actually addressed many of the presenting problems, the figure faces behind BCH made it untrustworthy. So now, instead of Bitcoin adapting it created this 'us vs them' mentality. I don't think Satoshi could have predicted that, but it is human nature and ultimately why Bitcoin will never live up to Satoshis vision.",1526798634

"## Pro &amp; Con Contest 

Greetings everyone and welcome to the first *Pro &amp; Con Contest*. In this contest, participants will compete against one another to present the best arguments for or against a coin, token, or project. The end goal is to stimulate healthy debate and hopefully learn true knowledge from this evaluation process. 

**General Details**

*  u/CryptoCurrencyMod will officially represent the entire mod team in administering the contest. It will be posted and stickied inside the Skeptics thread so it can thrive off a serious discussion environment which already exists.

* Duration will range from one week to several weeks depending on the topics and how much past participation there is.

* Arguments presented in this contest will be considered as material for r/CryptoWikis. Select contestants may also be offered wiki editor or mod positions at r/CryptoWikis.

* As mentioned in the main text of this thread, this is a pilot project so expect the rules, schedule, and format to change over time. If these first and second contests are not successful in terms of participation, either major changes wil be made or the entire project could be canceled.

* Anyone not interested in the contest can just ignore it and use the Skeptics thread as they did before.

**Rules**

* Anyone can enter. This also applies to users who do not meet the karma and age requirements. Arguments/comments submitted by these users will be removed by the AutoModerator until manually approved, depending on what there quality is.

* Arguments must be submitted in response to the correct sub-thread or will not be accepted. 

* Ad hominems, profanity, or abusive language of any kind will disqualify an argument unless the contestant revises it.  This behavior will not be tolerated in the lower-level commentary either.

* Contestants may revise their arguments until the end of the contest, which could be one or two weeks. After this time window has ended, the Skeptics thread will be locked for judging.

* Winners will be awarded and recognized with trophy flairs, such as the ones issued in the banner and theme contests. Contestants who win two or three times will receive a higher trophy, ie silver or gold rather than bronze. Contestants who win over three times, will just have their text flairs updated to show their win score. The trophy flairs are not mandatory. No monetary prizes will be given.

**Topics and Sub-Thread Links**

PhantomMod here. As stated in the title, the topics for this first contest are Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin. Yes, in the [announcement thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencyMeta/comments/8hqynj/introducing_the_weekly_procon_contest/) I said there would only be one topic and it would be EOS. However, due to new ideas I came up with, scheduling issues, etc., I decided to choose multiple coins which were established and in their own competitive category, more or less.  My theory is if we include multiple competing coins in one contest, there could be a greater confluence of opinions which will lead to a richer debate, hopefully without too much fighting...  That's just one reason but I'll explain my new ideas further and propose a future schedule in a meta thread maybe later on today.

So finally without waiting any longer, here are the argument threads:

Bitcoin(BTC):

* [Pro-Arguments](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8j28z2/weekly_skeptics_discussion_may_13_2018_pro_con/dywgmww/)

As long as the market is unregulated they will continue to manipulate to gain as much BTC as they can at the lowest price possible but I can't see it dropping too much more as it is in there best interest for it to stay profitable for miners.

You make it sound like BIP 91 was able to orphan non-Segwit signaling miners prior to being adopted by the network, which isn't possible. It had to be adopted through majority consensus first.

Let’s say that you have qtum and you wanted that to change to ada, if there were a ada or qtum market, the spread would probably be higher than if somebody would just change twice in a btc market.

"Happy to dispute your claims, if not to convince you, then to set the record straight for anyone else reading.

&gt;Flat lie, at lock in, the consensus agreement explicitly required the 2x block size limit increase hard fork to occur at a specified block height. Since that never happened, SegWit on BTC is illegitimate per Nakamoto Consensus from that block height on.


Not at all a 'flat lie', I merely stated facts. I said SegWit was not the same as SegWit2x, that's not an opinion, these were 2 separate proposals, with 2 separate code bases [SW](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki) &amp; [SW2x](https://github.com/segwit2x/segwit2x.github.io) and required 2 separate triggering events based on 2 separate consensus thresholds. SegWit was locked in via [BIP91](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0091.mediawiki) on June 20th, 2017 and activated on August 23rd, 2017.

Where I believe you're mistaken here is by saying the ""consensus agreement explicitly required the 2x..."". That's not how Nakamoto consensus works. The only way to achieve consensus is with significant, sustained hashing power. The agreement you're talking about (the New York Agreement) was just a letter of intent by companies to support the 2x fork.

&gt;In fact, it's the only reason that the farce that was SegWit2x ever got any support over about the 30% - 35% (never over 40%) miner support level. After adding the 2x requirement, total miner support peaked well over 90%, indicating the most important part of the agreement was the ""2x"" component NOT SegWit.


[2x failed](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/now-segwit2x-hard-fork-has-really-failed-activate/), not because of the NYA wasn't followed, but because the intended hashrate that said they were going to support it didn't... and actually they couldn't, because there was a bug in the code that prevented the forked block from being mined.",1526796554

Here a summary of what doesn't work \(I might actually be willing to team up and share my source code on github if people wanna jump in \(e.g. u/thegreatmuffin what about u?\):

I spotted 18 words from the BIP39 list that have an intersection with the orange B \(actually 16 \+ the numbers 3 and 12 which I converted to the words three and twelve\) I looked up the word order of first apearances of those 18 words in the paper \(excluding multiple occurences\). However the checksum of the last word doesn't come up. 

So I took every subset of 12 and 15 words \(respecting the order\) where the checksum for a BIP39 seed summed up. Those where 1214 seeds. none of which produced the address that was provided. 

also checking all permutations of those 18 words won't work since I can only check about 3k permutations per second and there are way too many permutations for this to be reasonable. Also it is not even clear if we are really talking about those 18 words...

"A lot of the projects/coins doing the same thing will probably go under. Bitcoin price will probably go up since it's unlikely google will compete directly with them as a currency. More likely for google to make a platform based type coin so ethereum and EOS may be hurt the most. Depends a bit on how good the product is.

Google will probably make so much money. They start an ICO and rake it in, and their stock also goes up.  Other tech companies follow and we start a new frenzy of bull run. It crashes because it went up too fast and we start the cycle over again.

Or, google will make an internal crypto based on a blockchain that's never sold. They get all the same functionalities and benefits without trading it. This seems more likely to me. The technology is quite great but I don't see why they have to make it publicly traded.  

They don't need money to fund development. I believe Vitalik probably didn't like the idea of mining and ethereum's price being pumped so high. But he was a nobody, he had to start somewhere and the incentives for others to run nodes and developers to be attracted would have to be money.  Google doesn't need that. 

Vitalik has said repeatedly he thinks ethereum is overvalued since around November. He is also transitioning to proof of stake sometime in the next year. Which makes me feel like he knew he had to start with proof of work but now that it's established somewhat he can transition. ",1526795639

Decentralized exchange.   
You hold your keys and coins in your own wallet.   You don’t send them to an exchange that is susceptible to hacks, freezes and really anything else they are becoming subject to as the market evolves.  

Jumblr.    
Built in privacy choice.   You can make your coins anonymous... or not.  It’s up to you.   

dICO platform.    
Instead of running and ICO on a central service susceptible to hacks and manipulation by whales, the dICO is a wallet to wallet transfer of the coins you buy.   This isn’t on Ethereum it’s on a separate blockchain so it won’t have Gas price issues or slow transfers.    

Agama wallet.   
A multicoin wallet that you can keep any coin in that is launched on the Komodo platform.  No more MEW phishing or security certificate hacks.  It also pays you rewards for staking your tokens in the wallet.   

dPoW.  
PoW is how bitcoin works and it’s the most used blockchain which theoretically makes it the most secure.    Every ten minutes, the community voted notary nodes “attach” the data on the Komodo platform to the bitcoin blockchain.  

2017 Fomo.  
Trust him... 2018 is the year of put up or shut up.   Komodo has been running what other tokens are planning to do.  Komodo is putting 5 different coin features in one platform because why do they all need to be separate?    Use case is key and while other platforms are launching test nets for exchanges and their own blockchains, Komodo has been working on their coding for years and their main net has been running for almost 16 months (I think).    


PS smart contracts and cross chain compatibility are almost complete too, two other things that coins base their foundation on, Komodo just adds to their already functioning product.  ",1526794958

Pretending that they are talking about something else and fabricating something else because mean people called you names on the internet is the tactics of a child.

Lightning can do atomic swaps where you can trustlessly swap Bitcoin for Litecoin.  This is possible with any blockchain that has transaction malleability fixes, plus some other specific requirements I'm unable to find right now but many coins meet the criteria and many more could if they wanted to.

I think many alts have interesting value propositions, and some of them even have interesting development happening around them.  With that said, I think any alt whose value proposition is ""Bitcoin but we added/fixed X"" is rather pointless.  Along those same veins, I think people vastly underestimate how powerful Bitcoin really is.  Programmable money, even if it's not Turing complete, is something you can't quite improve upon until you've found its limits and we've not even scratched the surface of those limits.

"Well, maybe we can social engineer the solution or find some clues. 

Looking at the inner white circle, the words ""(see) block chain transaction"" kinda sticks out due to their huge font size (additionally there is an arrow ""&lt;="" pointing at ""chain"")

[Clue #2](https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8kk0pa/1_btc_is_hidden_in_this_puzzle_good_luck/dz91gb5/) and the word combinations ""hashing earlier"" and ""creator checks"" brought me to the idea to check Stackexchange.

Interestingly, there is this question that was asked 4 months ago,
[How to generate a valid hash for a bip39 seed phrase?](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/68605/how-to-generate-a-valid-hash-for-a-bip39-seed-phrase). It already had some helping answers previously, but there was another one that was posted 26 hours ago (2 hours prior the initial transaction of 1BTC to the bounty address). I mean who knows, maybe the author was looking for ways to conceal the answer and wanted to help out the community at the same time.

Furthermore, if you check the authors profile on Stackexchange, you will notice that his avatar is some acryl painting suggesting that this guy is into arts. Now this might be a relevant clue due to the fact that [www.cryptogreetings.com](www.cryptogreetings.com) &lt;-&gt; /u/cryptogreetings , is very related to arts. What also caught my eye was the fact that this guy edited his answer two times during the last 22 hours despite the fact that this question is about 4 months old and was previously answered. It is also mentionable that he has some serious knowledge in terms of crypto [and especially crypto wallets](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/users/10377/skaht?tab=answers&amp;sort=newest), and here you have to remember that someone who invents these riddles knows exactly what and how he is doing it.

If you look further into [this answer](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/75314), you can see that the author is emphasizing the utilization of ""Bitcoin explorer's (subcommand mnemonic-new)"" which correlates with the subliminal message ""(see) block chain transaction"" from the given picture. 

Now from this point, there could be many two (or maybe more) approaches regarding the clue ""hashing earlier"" (Haven't tried to check these yet):

- A combination of BIP39 words could be hashed into a Base16 string that is evenly divisble by 32 bits (requirement for bx mnemonic new) and then be used to create a BIP39 seed (for the bounty address)

- Or you could **somehow** derive a Base16 string from the picture, with the same criteria as mentioned above which could also be used to create a BIP39 seed through (bx mnemonic-new)

Another random thought I came up due to [this comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8kk0pa/1_btc_is_hidden_in_this_puzzle_good_luck/dz99det/) (maybe another clue?), was to check the hex address @00212121 of the original picture, take the next 32 bytes beginning from 00212121&amp;00212120 and use them to create 2 BIP39 seeds. But both of them lead to empty addresses.

Maybe this is way too much overthinking, but it never hurts to try unorthodox approaches.

We still have yet to see the full effect of Brexit on the UK’s economy but things aren’t looking all that stable given the amount of regret going on and the dragging of their feet to fully implement Brexit.


The US has a massive vulnerability with its national debt. Enough that it had its credit rating reduced over political partisanship. That phrase “full faith and credit” of the government is starting to sound a bit hollow.

"&gt;Nano has something called representatives, which vote on forks just like this. The representatives look at both transactions, then vote to decide which one to keep and which one to throw away. Normally, they just pick the first one.

&gt;Every single node on the network is eligible to be a representative, and their vote is calculated by how many Nano is held in their account.

This is PoS right? 

The representative thing and delegation sounds wild. How does the software vote, you said it's usually just the first transaction that gets approved, are there any exceptions? 

How much storage space does running a full node take, since transactions still have to be published to the network? Or are they not stored permanently, only until they are confirmed by representatives? How could I, running a node, check the balance of an account? Or could I not because of the gossiping idea? 

&gt; their vote is calculated by how many nano is in their account 

So I understand that this is probably more of a general PoS question, but doesn't this just reward the rich, creating a class system? There's no guarantee they are good guys right? If I have a bunch of rich friends, couldn't I double spend? How resistant is PoS to 51% attacks? 

&gt;Publishing to the network is just basically spreading gossip

k

&gt;Enjoy your 10 minute block times (source: https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-confirmationtime.html). What does that make, an hour with 6 confirmations?

1: You don't need to source 10 minute block times. It's like that be design and we all know it.

2a: Confirmation security is determined by the likelyhood of reorganization of that specific block over time. This doesn't change with smaller confirmation times, it stays the same and ends up requiring more confirmations for the same security. There's a reason exchanges require many more confirmations for an Ethereum transaction than they do a Bitcoin transaction. Orphan rates are the reason long block times exist.

2b: Etheruem has uncles, with some system that incentivizes miners to include other peoples uncles into blocks, but this doesn't solve the issue with orphans. Not all orphans are uncles, but all uncles are orphans and might have a twin or two that never got uncled. Does that even make sense to you? Orphan rates matter because it skews towards centralization since larger miners can eat the loss of a single block, whereas smaller miners lose a bigger share of their profits when a block they successfully mined is orphaned. You can say that's why pools exist, but this effects pools the same way, smaller pools can't eat those losses, and not everyone wants to trust a pool to run the consensus code they agree with.

Nothing about Tendermint helps Ethereum scale trustlessly, and everything about Tendermint can be applied to Bitcoin in the same ways they can be applied to Ethereum. It's a moot argument.

"&gt; PoS can have a lower barrier to entry than POW and everyone is only as powerful as the coin they’re willing to stake.

False. 

Participation in PoW is *permissionless* as anyone can mine and obtain tokens with no prior participation required.

Participation in PoS is *permissioned* as you always need to obtain your tokens from someone else. Whether that is from the devs, an airdrop, a faucet, or purchased on an exchange: if there's no-one willing to sell, you don't get to participate.

We could go on for days about how it's impossible to fairly distribute tokens without mining, and how PoS will **always** incentivize people to form monopolies and cartels to maintain majority control.

&gt; POW is not very green especially compared to PoS and it’s much less harsh on the environment than POW, which is fact.

And yet mining is merely bound by the world in which it operates. If the world were 100% solar powered, so mining would be too.

Go and look up ""bunker fuel"" and take a look at the thousands of freighters which are used just to transport consumer goods from A to B. Why don't we just stop buying cheap plastic goods from China and save the environment that way, why is crypto-mining the worst thing for the environment?

"And your use of buzzwords doesn’t inherently improve your repetitive argument. 

You’re correct in that your hypothetically hungry poor person is hungry not because there was not a bad harvest. Their hunger lies in the fact that they are poor. They are poor because they do not provide enough value in order to be rich. 

So let’s take a look back at our earlier lessons in economics 101. Your skill, labor, service, whatever the fuck you want to list here, is only worth what people are willing to pay you. That fundamental principal does not change regardless of payment methods. If one crypto coin is equal to one dollar, and your product is worth one dollar, your product is still worth one crypto, or one dollar. 

Now if crypto was easier to acquire than fiat, then your ideology of rainbows, butterfly’s, and world peace would have some basis in reality. However, crypto is not inherently easier to acquire than fiat. You give a hungry kid in Africa a hard drive with a bit coin on it, he will try to eat the hard drive. Now, since you’re so brilliant, and capable of using such impressive buzzwords, you should be fully capable of interpreting that statement.

If there's not cash, you simply can't escape the government, because everything will go through controlled bank accounts.

Cryptocurrencies are here to save us from that socialist dystopia. Bitcoin is a way to fight the government and their control over us, and governments didn't count on the invention of Bitcoin, so we have the ultimate weapon on our side :)

"&gt;Then they formed Blockstream some time later. And brought on hundreds of millions in investors who no doubt wanted a return on their investment.

You are pretty much just assuming this is what happened. Just because investors invest money in a company doesn't mean they have any control unless they own a large piece of the company equity.

This is a very common practice like other companies do with Linux and other open source technologies.

BCH was literally created by a corporation (Bitmain with ViaBTC) with an ultra rich shady businessman (Roger Ver) as the face of the community which is also financially backed by the shady billionaire Calvin Ayre who was once on Americas Top 10 most wanted for fraud and money laundering.

Dash has a game theory problem.

So we have 4 types of people:

 1. Miner Only
 2. Staker Only
 3. Staker + Miner
 4. The public

Imagine you are a miner (1) or staker (2) trying to acquire Dash, your goal is to make profit. If you are a miner you can use some parts of your infrastructure to both host masternodes and miners. Doing this increases your revenue.

If you are bad at staking (2) you lose your position, keeping the people good at staking and the people good at mining. Good miners will likely be good stakers (3) since they can share some infrastructure. These players have more revenue than anyone only staking allowing them to save more and increase their staking nodes. So, we can probably assume the majority of stake is the same as of the majority of the hash power given a bit of time.

At this point very few people are Staking Only (2) or Mining Only (1) because the difficulty is too high and for it to be profitable. This generates lots of conflict of interest. The people that control the network (3). Can agree to stop mining benefiting them all. The reasoning is simple it can can be sold to the public (4) as a necessity due to wasting energy. When really it is in their interest and is costing them money. They could just go 100% proof of stake. I mean it works for everyone else doesn't it?

This happened to Ethereum. The big stakers initially were also miners, they got pushed out, now the people with the biggest stake who are also public figures are advocating for a shift to proof of stake.

If Dash starts to have that discussion they will fall into the same argument and manipulation of public perception. If it ever does occur you probably a get:

 * A Proof of stake chain
 * A Proof of work chain 
  * Bitmain is now producing Ethereum and Dash miners
  * It is likely at too higher difficulty for the small pools, but the dash miners would suddenly become very cheap keeping the chain alive.
 
But both these systems are being tried right now. So what is the point on trying dash now when this is a risk to hold the currency back just as the blocksize debate did. You might as well just migrate your operation to one of the Proof of work or Proof of stake systems that are working today.

"Eth being centralized is standard knowledge among all cryptocurrency developers outside of eth, since it's not even remotely debatable, requires no opinion, literally cannot be proven any better by any sequence of events possible. https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereumfraud/comments/7pe8ot/virtually_all_crypto_devs_and_experts_spoken_out/

it's capable today of doing at least 3k tx/sec as tested globally before, possibly more, which on level of reddit few years back according to the data from back then.

ok, so you agree, but excuse is no good dex's? yes, true, bitshares being by far the best probably, blocknet/barterdex have some probably highest quality tech but very rough around the edges, 

but ethereum isn't capable of dex's or anything decentralized, not even 1 decentralized transaction in its history, and thus no good developers would waste time building on centralized eth or onecoin hence not holding my breath.

&gt;  they made a token on a decentralized platform 

I'm confused, you state it like its not a fact that ethereum being centralized is objective and not only in theory since premine but uniquely proven by publicly verifiable actions.

Ok, so both have the centralized premine issue unlike classic legitimate coins, so eos might be centralized if distribution was gamed in same way eth's could be, but relatively every aspect of it is more decentralized while ethereum developers chose the worst choice every time for decentralization.

First, I already cited my sources of actual verifiable data unlike your random emotion based opinion, but I'll just link another post so I don't repeat myself: https://np.reddit.com/r/eos/comments/8kkxy2/early_days_of_ethereum_vs_eos/dz974ya/

Find 1 thing wrong in the 2nd link. Just 1 incorrect statement that is not objective.

Exactly. Now that we know (like everyone not part of eth scam) that it is centralized and on scale of decentralization vs centralization an absolute 0 and perfect decentralization is not possible, we can only compare relatively.

What funds development on each &amp; can be withheld to force changes:

* eth: only centralized premine and centralized funding through ico
* eos: same as eth but also on-chain DAO (same as on all dan's dpop making them self sustainable and predating eth)

How many entities control each:

* eth: only ethereum foundation - demonstrated when editing state in minutes, otherwise 2 mining operators.
* eos: 15 of 21 equally weighted validators: https://i.imgur.com/rhPiMiG.jpg

Ok, but who chooses those controlling entities:

* eth: foundation chose itself as sole funding source, and miners chosen through delegation to a single pool at a time ([plurality](http://scorevoting.net/BayRegsFig.html)) and later will use worst possible distribution of stake for PoS to make control w/ premine even easier than already demonstrated thanks to classic PoS master node design in Casper ([link](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereumfraud/comments/7djclm/casper_masternode_pos_variant_to_use_70_premined/)). 
* eos: any number of possibly millions or trillions of vested voters with something at stake control the chain: https://i.imgur.com/bf3phzM.png using the best and most resistant model to abuse of approval voting (http://scorevoting.net/BayRegsFig.html)

Ok, but what keeps it secure:

* eth: only trust and hope in foundation's mood. if foundation allows transactions, then virtually no punishments in its PoW and easily returnable video cards, and when casper they will use slashing conditions to punish dissent and make it even easier to attack dissent on forks they disagree with, permanently punish honest players for making accidental mistakes, and force people to pay minimum to validate for higher barrier to entry where more wealth (like from premine) means proportionally more control growing in centralization over time according to pareto and income and less wealth makes you irrelevant and diluted. slashing amounts are completely arbitrary and easily ignored via leverage. also the least ethical and worst development team in crypto that likes to [abuse their role](https://i.imgur.com/i9InG68.png) with [default settings](http://i.imgur.com/IStgCuO.png) in addition to distribution issues. 
* eos: voters have something at stake meaning malicious votes might hurt their value, and producers have their job at stake losing which would lose them, for all purposes, infinite potential income resulting in most cost for not playing honest among all known designs. dao funded projects have to keep performing or lose their income. inflation is minimized thanks to burning 1% of ram trading volume. approval voting removes parties usually permanently so they can't easily try again unlike on some PoW or Casper. In that voting scheme whale with 40% of coins easily kicked out for being malicious from producers by the rest of network with only 41% of coins combined while in casper/pow can stay malicious for long time.

Ok, but PoS platforms must care about wide distribution of coins right?

* eth: doesn't care at all. chose to premine most of supply and use design that makes coin grabs easiest through maximum liquidity. only let people enter for few weeks.
* eos: simulated PoW best they could (citing economies of scale downsides to PoW) for sale to where liqudity on market is small but determines price and thus punishes coin grabs - same way all PoS protects against coin grabs once distributed. gave people entire year to enter and participate in distribution. safer against 3rd party attacks, same issues against attacks from premine group.

by every metric eos and dan's dpos is equal to or better than ethereum's proven 0 decentralization, but then again almost everything is better including dogecoin (better) and onecoin (equal). eth is the best example of censorship on blockchain, best example of centralization on blockchain, and best example of unethical developers &amp; community promoting unsafe practices.

"From what I gather this needs to be taken literally. 

If you want to get 1 bitcoin, how do you get it? 

You have to mine a block. 

What's been shared is analogous to a block. It's a tough problem needing to be solved.

How does a miner solve a problem? It essentially brute forces till it finds a solution.

In this case we aren't expected to brute force, because we can see some clues. White circle, orange outside, orange inside. One clue is throw out more than half the words, maybe the white? Maybe the orange? Probably the orange.

Nakamoto gave us a paper. The words of the paper are in the block. We want to add that to the chain so we want to solve it.

Solving it means going back in time before Nakamoto to see if previous work matches up with his research.

I'd look for white words that occur in all the references + Nakamoto's paper. The seed is probably the 12 words that appear most often in all references.

"I want to play devils advocate and say that I believe the exchanges deserve to be the main winners here.  When people criticize cryptocurrency for being a scam or bubble, people always point to the technology.

This whole thing cant be a bubble when there are multi million dollar mining farms, new startup/partnerships every day, along with countless scientists, programmers and mathematicians putting their careers in this. 

That's what this comes down too. If cryptocurrencies value is not   100&amp;#37; speculation, then its underlying value is held mostly by those who work in that technical industry. One day that may be huge supply chain, data storage, and contract management industries.  But right now, those industries are in their infancy, while the market for exchanges is booming.

I don't have any data on how many people exchanges employ vs. how many people work full time in crypto.  But I don't want this to be a war between them.  My point is that anyone working full time in the crypto space is adding more real world value to the currency than anyone who just buys and holds.

What is the value of a network if people just buy and hold. That is static.  I agree that their power and wealth leads to manipulation of markets. But to me it just makes economical sense that those managing the infrastructure of the market will win bigger than those just participating. 

That happens in all markets, so why complain about it?

Maybe the solution is decentralized exchanged.  I don't know. ",1526779102

"If you're renting your just throwing money away. If you buy a house you are paying of an asset that in gereat goes up in value. If hard times come you can sell the house and basically get back all your money. There is not a financial expert in the planet that says rebtibg long term is better than buying a home.  Not to mention mortgage interest rates are very low right now. So there is no point in saying a house off all at once unless you truly have everything else set (retirement, investments, vehicles, health savings plans, student loans, future kids college fund etc.) 

This has nothing to do with crypto currency. ",1526778861
"&gt;&gt; LN will not replace banks.

&gt; Well yes that's exactly what I said.

What you didn't say was that it would _help_ banks, which I did. Followed by a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYHFrf5ci_g).

&gt; The average person wants government protectionism. And that's fine. But it is no reason to change cryptocurrencies to appease the average person.

The average person wants something that makes their lives better. And that _is_ a valid reason to appease them. Unless you don't want the average person using it, which defeats the entire reason of scaling to millions in the first place.

&gt; Linux wasn't. And yet they are very useful for people who want to use them.

They are useful to a small niche. They are not widely used. And, unlike LN, they work.

&gt; Routing is trivial with semi-centralized directory servers (like, you know, _Tor_).

Lol, I actually laughed at that. The LN routing issue is not trivial. It is completely unsolved. It is also completely different than the internet (which TOR uses to work). The internet has a back end that adheres to the standards set forth by an independent, international organization (ICANN), to insure fairness and prevent bad actors. This is the _only reason_ the internet works; because every player follows these regulations, making the system 100% honest. In effect, they can trust each other. Additionally, unlike TOR, LN users are always moving money into, out of, and through channels, and everyone else is doing it too, making the problem orders of magnitude more complicated. This is only the beginning of LN's problems.

"Your cryptographic method is slightly off. Here is what could be done:

OP writes a text file of instructions on how to decrypt the image. That file is then hashed, and the hash output is posted publicly. 

Using the privkey of the btc address encoded into the picture, OP could then sign a message that reads “I control the private key of address __ADDRESS__, here is the hash of the instructions to decipher the image __HASH__.”

This would allow others to immediately verify that OP controls the address. And then once the funds have been claimed, OP could post the text file to prove the puzzle was authentic (as anyone could hash it to verify it matches the hash OP posted earlier). 

Note that OP could still claim the funds themselves, my method would not stop them rigging the puzzle in that way.

"Him saying ""most people can run nodes on mobile"" is factually incorrect. 

I'm sure the reason he's saying this is because while I'm sure he's one of the smartest developers in crypto, he has no experience actually building and shipping a production mobile app, with real users.

Well I have plenty of experience with that, and I even have built a ""node"" on mobile (both on iOS and Android) and never launched it. The reason: I never see this taking off any time soon with mainstream audience. NOBODY wants to run a p2p node on their phone.

Nobody wants to waste network traffic, storage space, and their device computing power by running a p2p node, when all they want is to send money. Remember, the alternative is apps like venmo and paypal whose app size is in megabytes scale (not gigabytes), and never use unnecessary network traffic just to synchronize (it's all stateless http based). Also on mobile people care a lot about battery, so if you notice, most people don't even want to keep multiple apps running in the background. They manually kill all apps when they're not using just to save battery. And when it comes to Android, this becomes exponentially more severe than on iOS. I'm not even going to go into more details on this because there are many more factors I don't have time to discuss, including user behaviors/expectations, etc. but this is the reality.

Most people will just want a simple light client so they can create transactions, sign, and simply broadcast to trusted nodes. In my experience and point of view, this is more than secure enough. Which is why most people will take this approach.

So, dear Luke Jr.: please go build a mobile app that works as a node, launch it on the app store / play store, and get millions of users, and then come back. Then we can talk. I doubt you can reach even thousands of users with that approach.",1526778743

"&gt; What happened to satoshis vision? You guys said bitcoin was made for on chain transactions only and that anything else is not bitcoin because its not in the whitepaper. Bcash's entire arguement is that big blocks can scale to mass adoption by raising the block size indefinitely.


No. 

Layer two has never been an issue. The problem has always been the limiting of layer one by Bitcoin Core. And the complete refusal to ever expand layer one because of large egos and questionable assumptions about the distant future.

If you think we have a problem with layer two solutions, you are not accurately understanding our position on the matter.  The mantra has always been “both“.

There is also a healthy dose of justified anger about a corporation coming in and killing on-chain, so they can build off-chain products they plan to charge for.  This resulted in a more global rejection of “anything Core” even if they did at some point decide to re-enable Layer 1.  

There are several aspects to what is going on here. But under no circumstances has the war cry been “only on-chain“.",1526778478

REQ has a relatively low cap and will be burning coins. The team has had zero slip ups, they have been very professional, they have met all their deadlines (and have actually met multiple deadlines before expected), they have a fuck ton of partnerships, and they are setting out to solve a REAL problem in crypto that will undeniably benefit the crypto ecosystem. 

You're fucked in the head if you really think REQ is an utter shitcoin or you just haven't done any research at all. I can see how some people have doubts towards the ambition of the project.

2. I want to transfer money to someone on another country. Say, I have a son abroad, and he needs money urgently during a weekend? Right now, the only ways I know of are money wire services, or bank transfers, and both have limited schedules and don't work during weekends. Some countries require extensive paper work for you to even be allowed to transfer money out of the country, and some countries don't allow it at all. So yeh **Permissioneless, and privacy are important too **

I can go on and on about the use cases, such as protection against inflation, transaction fees (which is debatable, but our hope is that one day we'll be able to do micro transactions that cost pennies -- For larger transactions BTC is already superior), total control of your funds, having a trustless system based on consensus rather than fiat money that's backed by goverments which in most cases are corrupt and use the monetary system to enrich the wealthy and empoverish the already poor and middle class, and so on, and so on.

In the US you assume a new cost basis on the day of the transfer.  

So if your bro bought 1 BTC for $6000,  and gifted it to you some time later and on that day BTC was $7,000, YOUR new basis is $7,000.  

Your brother has to count $7,000 against the $14,000 he is allowed to gift to whomever tax free AND your brother would owe short term capital gains tax on $1,000.

"I have been wondering about the Bitcoin Core
Developers recently and how all of them ended up in their roles. Have all of them worked on Bitcoin from the beginning ? Were some chosen or removed by the community? 

One of the biggest arguments the maximalists use is that BTC doesn’t have a figurehead or foundation in charge. So, because Nakamoto is anonymous, all other projects must also have an anonymous creator, or it will never be Bitcoin???

This is the convoluted logic that is being used. Bitcoin did not need someone to pave the way when it was the only crypto around. It could be a community-driven project because it had zero competition. Now, there are a lot of competitors out there, some less “centralized” than others. 

The problem is that Open-source community development is not a competitive strategy. Competition must differentiate themselves quickly while changing often. How are you supposed to do this without a leader or foundation, or some vision of the future? 

Regardless, the argument makes no sense because someone or some group must be in charge or making decisions for BTC. BTC chose inaction over action.  This decision was not made by the community, nor was it made by a robot. It was made by real people who are still playing puppet master with BTC. I have a hard time comprehending how anyone can say that BTC is not being run by anyone because the creator is anonymous. 

BTC purists are anarchists/capitalists, but they are about to get taught a lesson in free-market competition.  ",1526775455

"Meh. I didn't really pay attention to the MSM coverage of consensus, and I too was largely disappointed. It was mostly a lot of talk that we've been hearing for a year now.

The hype from 2017 got ahead of the tech, and now we have to deal with a bit of a hangover. 

In the long run, it doesn't really matter. The tech continues to evolve and improve. Eventually we'll see it deliver. The short term road just may be a little bumpy as the hype runs out of rocket fuel. I guess I'm jaded, but I feel like we pretty much deserved this after 2017 :) Technology continues unabated, relentless in its march - blockchain is a key part of the next steps.",1526775119

"The key difference is the ""blockchain"" part. With Nano, each account creates it's own chain vs a single one that encompasses every single user on the entire network like most other currencies.

It works because each chain publishes a block that interacts with another chain.

---

For example, **account A** might say, ""I'm sending 5 Nano to **account B**."" It gets published to the network and 5 Nano is removed from **account A**.

As soon as **account B** sees that it was sent something, it says, ""I have received 5 Nano from **account A**. He then publishes it to the network and 5 Nano gets added to his account.

Publishing to the network is basically spreading gossip. You tell your friend, he tells his, and so on. Eventually every single person (node) on the world (connected to the network) knows.

But what if some asshole only has 6 Nano in his account, but says the same thing to different people with two different receivers?

---

For example, **account A** (the asshole with 6 Nano) might say ""I just sent 5 Nano to **account B**!"" to James (Node 1) and then immediately say ""I just sent 5 Nano to **account C**!"" to Ben (Node 2).

Nano has something called representatives, which vote on forks just like this. The representatives look at both transactions, then vote to decide which one to keep and which one to throw away. Normally, they just pick the first one.

Every single node on the network is eligible to be a representative, and their vote is calculated by how many Nano is held in their account.

But what about people with Nano who don't run their own node? They delegate their Nano to other representatives who they trust to vote fairly.

For example, **representative A** might only have 10 Nano in his account, but has both **account A** and **account B** delegating their votes to him. **Account A** has 5 Nano in his account, and **account B** has 15. Therefore, **representative A** has a vote of 10 + 5 + 15 = __30 Nano__.

---

There are a few other things an account can do besides send and receive. They can *change* and they can *open*.

*Changing* is just telling the network which representative you want to delegate your balance too. Basically, you're just saying ""I want Joe Schmoe to vote for me.""

*Opening* is when you first tell the network that your account exists. It requires someone to send your account any amount of Nano. You then say something similar to what you would say if you were receiveing it normally, but you would ALSO include who's voting for you, even if it's yourself.

---

This completely eliminates the need for miners. Nobody has to fight over the hash of something published every ten minutes, and that's the main electricity sink of most currencies.

For example, Bitcoin can be described as one governing agency (all the miners) gathering every single transaction that takes place and publishing a newspaper with the updated balance of everyone every couple minutes.

Nano is closer to a Facebook group or subreddit. It's just a bunch of people posting ""I sent this,"" or ""Somebody sent me something,"" or ""Yo, let XYX vote for me, I'm lazy,"" or ""What's up! I'm new here."" Because of it's asynchronous nature, it's effectively instant. As soon as **account B** reads a post made by **account A**, he can post a receive block and then immediately send his new balance to someone else with another post.

---

Of course, Nano has some problems. The biggest one is centralization. Close to half of accounts have the official developer nodes as their representative. This is because most wallets choose one by default, and people are too lazy to find a good community-run one and use that.

Another one is how untested it is. The limiting volume is how fast each node (e.g. person) can download and process transactions (e.g. can read new posts on Facebook/Reddit). In controlled tests by the devs on testnets, it's supposed to be about 10k per second and improve as hard drive speed improves over the years.

In community run tests on the main network, Nano has reached 100's of transactions per second with very few problems. The limiting factor is how fast the tester's can publish them, not the actual network so far.

"&gt;  No no no, it’s not.
You sounded like Carlos Matos there.

Look, yeh, BTC and crypto in general is a great way to transfer value, and it is a great alternative to fiat in many cases. As early adopters we do realize its potential and how it can revolutionize transacting, and money transfers as we know it today. 

But here is the catch:
 
The fact that you realize how much potential the technology has, goes hand in hand with wanting to profit from it.
The fact that we want to profit from it means we acknowledge its value and appeal, and think the more people that learn about it, the higher the demand will be, and so as early adopters we can make money from everyone else who joins the party later. It's kind of an entry fee for everyone who joins after you. The ones who join later get dumped on by the ones who were there early, and now you wait for your turn to dump on the next wave, It's a chain.

We do not know how far this will go, and whether the ""bubble"" will ever pop, or if crypto will become the defacto currency of the world, BUT the fact that we are here means we do believe in the technology, so please spare us these mindless preaching posts.

"Here what i've found:

1) Install node.js from here https://nodejs.org

2) use console (for windows - cmd, for unix it would be terminal emulator (ctr+alt+T etc.)) and navigate to directory where you will manage the problem (where you will create a script and will work with it). Here run in the console the command ""npm install bitcoinjs-lib"" (https://www.npmjs.com/package/bitcoinjs-lib) and then ""npm i bip39"" (https://www.npmjs.com/package/bip39) it will download and install required for the script packages.

3) Create in this directory file with the next content (it would be the working script, assume you will name it as 'script.txt'):
++++++++
var bip39 = require('bip39');
var bitcoin = require('bitcoinjs-lib')

var lineReader = require('readline').createInterface({
  input: require('fs').createReadStream('addresses.txt')
});
var ctr = 1;
lineReader.on('line', function (line) {
    if (ctr%100 == 0) {
        console.log(""Processing #"" + ctr);
    }
    if (bip39.validateMnemonic(line)) {
        var roothex = bip39.mnemonicToSeedHex(line);
        var rootnode = bitcoin.HDNode.fromSeedHex(roothex);
        var basechild = rootnode.deriveHardened(49)
                .deriveHardened(0)
                .deriveHardened(0)
                .derive(0);
        for (var i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {
            var child = basechild.derive(i);
            var keyhash = bitcoin.crypto.hash160(child.getPublicKeyBuffer())
            var scriptSig = bitcoin.script.witnessPubKeyHash.output.encode(keyhash)
            var addressBytes = bitcoin.crypto.hash160(scriptSig)
            var outputScript = bitcoin.script.scriptHash.output.encode(addressBytes)
            var address = bitcoin.address.fromOutputScript(outputScript)
            if (address == ""3CcxyPhyvyc3S9UuPfu42GNZLvVVV11Uk8"") {
                console.log(""Found seed! "" + line)
            }
        }
    }
    ctr++;
});
++++++++

(without +++++++)

4) Create in the same directory file named 'addresses.txt' where each line is the 12 BIP39 words that should be bruteforced.

5) Run in the console this script by: ""node.exe script.txt"" (for windows) or ""node script.txt"" (for unix, maybe in unix it would be different)

That's all i've found. If you will find the file with all BIP39 words, share it please ))) (on pastebin for example)

"You only get a new coin after contentious hard-forks (where there's a disagreement on whether those changes should be made). The May 15th BCH hard-fork wasn't contentious, so no new coin was created. :)

"Honestly I don't mind BCH. they have issues but they are not that bad.

I've helped a friend build a store before that accepts bitcoin but it made little difference whether to accept bitcoin or fiat so only makes sense.

Problem is when people expect wrong level of security because they have been mislead by those seeking profit. There's nothing wrong with taking a calculated risk and dropping the high overhead costs of security. It's really scary when someone is forced to trust some centralized power won't hurt them or won't be used by a 3rd party under legal threat of threat of harm to abuse their position when people didn't even know that was possible.

I'm very curious about BCH large blocks, the other graphene tech, compression, and other tricks they want to try. Like many quality coins it's an experiment in what's possible with different choices in trade offs.

I totally agree converting between crypto is so easy, entire ecosystem basically sidechains right now (unpegged).",1526772918

Coinbase fully cooperates regarding of income disclosure. 

I advice you to report any income earned from digital currency to the IRS and just pay your taxes. If you hold the currency for &gt;1 year, your tax percentage will decrease.

Paying taxes is not that bad, just keep track of how much fiat you spend and how much you pull out.

"&gt;True. But presumably Bitfinex et al sell their crypto on a daily basis because they need fiat for their operations. So they'd have a fair bit saved up and can use it to print Tether.

That would be totally fine if they did that.  The question the OP mentioned would still exist though.  How and who are they selling the coins to?  USDT exists because the exchanges didn't want the trouble of having to deal with cash transactions in exchange for the coins.  

The alternative is that if they aren't selling it all off, they have to be holding it. This would lead to USDT being backed by something like bitcoin.

"I live off bitpay card and I load it regularly b/c I don't need BTC security for small amounts. I used testnet LN pretty easily, but haven't bothered with main net yet. Maybe when more places accept it.

Most people I follow in crypto and even many altcoin developers think bitcoin's approach makes sense, but doesn't stop others from trying their own tech \- variety or different trade offs choices are not bad.

Personally I don't like bitcoin's core usual dislike of drivechain tech \(although it's split\) for sidechains, but I LN fits a nice niche to where you may never want to use layer 1 again, only for emergencies or if you're moving enormous amount of money. And that's efforts of like 5 independent LN teams year ahead of everyone else.

they already have more nodes than most altcoins [https://lnmainnet.gaben.win/](https://lnmainnet.gaben.win/) and it actually provides incentives for even more nodes to come online for l1 just to get some fees from l2 vs for free. 

making a channel to any LN node provides ability to send to any other node on LN \(through any path you want or it can automate it for you\) \- funding a channel is similar to loading bitpay card but might even not be necessary when you are given LN bitcoins to start off with.

it already scaled basically.

it has downsides &amp; new so rough around edges but like any other network you get trade offs.

I ran trading bots on bitshares dex for a year\+ 24/7 and responsible probably for maybe a million transactions alone, all with \~ 1.5 sec confirmations, miniscule fees. It also has issues, but I took the trade off. They also have pretty much the only good stable coins for many years including now and were quite valuable for setting aside specific amounts.

I post on steem's steemit and some dtube stuff also on that network with no fees &amp; 1.5 sec confirms, although not every day.

I don't think they are all same level of decentralized, have issues, nothing can be perfect, but I'd rank them all above 0 that's reserved for the worst and proven worst possible networks like eth/iota/onecoin/bitconnect/neo/qtum/... this list too long to recall.

instead of reducing its own security to scale, bitcoin type tech can also focus on providing layers/sidechains and give people choices of what security/scaling trade offs they want like altcoins provide now and how I use them based on amt sent.

Say you are liquidating crypto to buy a house, if you believe crypto will increase in value more than 5% a year (historically it has) then it’s in your best interest financially to just liquidate enough to cover the deposit, then routinely liquidate some to pay the mortgage repayments.

"I still believe we'll have another bull run one day, but tbh my outlook has never been as bleak as it is now.  Allow me to clarify.

On the one hand I think we've had loads of institutional investors enter the market when Btc was in the 6ks (and maybe more to come if Btc goes lower) and these people will want a significant return on their investment so they'll use all their power and influence to drive up prices and exposure in the media.  

But on the other hand this is indicative of the fact that the market is currently entirely driven by the whales.  There is no new money.  I feel like we currently have mid 2017 volumes on 2018 prices.   A year ago when Eth was under $200, and Neo about $2 (!!!) there was enormous growth potential and you didn't need masses of new money.  But right now we have a market cap 6x what it was a year ago (even after the huge crash) but do we currently have volume 6x as great?  I'm not so sure.  Not only does exponential growth not last forever, but it hits it ceiling a lot quicker than people think.  

Anyway these are just some of the negative thoughts I've been having very recently.   Hopefully I'm completely wrong but Btc looks like absolute dogshit atm and even false whale pumps won't count for much unless a mass of new money floods in on top of it.  ",1526771021

In crypto we have nothing to go back but assessing people's technical merits and code.  So far, VeChain hasn't shown anything.  And I think the language thing is a poor excuse.  Da Hongfei does just fine and shows he's technically competent when he speaks.

Listen to Xinshu Dong, Zilliqa's CEO explain the different implementations of sharding (state vs network) and the challenges that blockhains face in implementing it.   Take a look at some of the team members on Zilliqa who have published research papers on Monero in the past.

VeChain on the other hand are completely lacking technical merit in the blockchain space.  It shows when they speak.  English being a problem is a poor excuse that guys like Justin Sun use.   ",1526770809

"Bullshit. No one who actually runs a node at home would be this clueless about what running a node actually entails. That's hundreds of Gigabytes uploaded every month and the vast majority of home internet connections are asymmetric and have somewhere between a tenth and a fifth of the throughput upstream as compared to downstream. It's also very very common to have bandwidth caps of only a couple hundred GBs per month, I had to stop running a Bitcoin node because I was hitting my bandwidth caps on a 100Mbps plan.

&gt;Not really. I've never even noticed any significant bandwidth usage from those. It's just not that much data.

What the hell do you think uses up hundreds of GB a month? Those two things take up basically all of the bandwidth used by a node. You are just talking out of your ass.

&gt;I have a regular internet connection at 100Mbps. 3-5Mbps isn't even felt. It's nothing. Playing video games takes more.

Completely idiotic and shows that you don't know how much bandwidth Bitcoin actually uses. You're just reading the image and pretending you know what you're talking about. That's the average bandwidth. Bitcoin is very bursty, every 10 minutes it's going to max out anything short of 100Mbps upload. Unless you set up QoS rules to throttle Bitcoin traffic every time a new block is found VoIP calls sound terrible, video calls lag and look like crap, and games start lagging. 3-5 Mbps wouldn't be that bad in terms of affecting everything else if that's all that it was, it's not, it'll use multiple times that much every time a new block is found.

You started out claiming that bandwidth use was nothing more than the equivalent of loading a web page every 10 minutes and now you're trying to claim that ""Oh it's hundreds of gigabytes every month but that's not really a lot"".

They might do account model vs utxo model and more asic resistance maybe but utxo is natively very scalable for batched tx it needs anyway and we had asic resistance for long time before asics came around resulting in a very nice &amp; wide distribution. early advantage could be improved on, but satoshi disappearing fixed it dramatically. none of the ico's today can claim even remotely same level of decentralized distribution of incentive coins as bitcoin enjoyed, much through luck.

I use some of the ultra fast and fee-free or close altcoins for small amounts (&lt;3 sec confirmations, 1 cent or under fees) and bitcoin for large amounts where the fees/speed are great &amp; security takes priority. The smaller the amount the less security you need. LN is still new and provides alternative to altcoins and only been out few months so tools and learning curve improving.

"Nobody wants what happened last year to happen again. But keep in mind all the things that happened during that time. Bitcoin was going through a huge hype cycle with unprecedented new users. Segwit which can offer 60% block size savings was barely adopted yet. (Now at 40% and growing) Coinbase and Bitpay, who are responsible for a huge amount of the transactions werent using Segwit yet, werent batching transactions, and at times were charging 5x what they needed too to get in the next block, causing everyone else to do the same. Also many of the wallet fee estimators were broken causing people to use higher fees than necessary. Also back then BCH was still using the EDA which caused difficulty to go way up and down. Everytime the difficulty dropped it made BCH more profitable to mine which caused part of the BTC hash rate to disappear right after a difficulty adjustment when BTC needed it most. Then of course the mempool was being spammed to make it even worse. Then the cherry on top was that the price quadrupled in under 2 months which basically quadrupled the fees because they are based on satoshis. It was a perfect storm of many issues. Thankfully many of those issues are gone now and Lightning is looking promising. One thing we can probably agree on is that i think a small blocksize increase probably couldn't hurt. I would be OK with a 2 to 4 MB blocksize.",1526768287

"&gt; wait 3 hours for the exchange to credit the deposit to your account, make a trade, wait until 2PM the next day

Time for a better exchange. There is no reason for an exchange to wait 3 hours to credit an account. Most exchanges are fine with ~3-4 confirmations for a major coin such as BTC or BCH, which in most cases takes about 30-40 minutes. Same with withdrawals. Once an exchange has credited your account there should be immediate (or near immed.) withdrawal policy unless some security concern is discovered. Cryptocurrency is about moving money pretty much near instantly, for very low cost, without regard for geography. If exchanges are not optimizing on that, again, time for a better exchange.",1526767452

Initially, the side chain patent owners will encourage adoption by allowing wide spread usage for free.  Like cocaine dealers, they give a little taste for free, then charge a little until they're hooked, then fuck them over big time.",1526767408

"&gt;What is your love affair with **everyone** running a full node

My initial statement:

&gt;No, it's about the ability to run one if you choose. **No one expects their grandma to run one.**

---

&gt;while also being against that same argument when people use it as a defense for big blocks.

If we both drive at the same speed traveling across the country, but I'm 3 days ahead of, you'll never catch up to me.

If I drive slower, you'll **eventually** catch up to me, **assuming nothing goes wrong with your vehicle.**

If I drive at half the speed I was going, it'll take you 3 days to get to where I ***was***, but now I'll still be 1.5 days ahead of you.

If I completely stop, it's still going to take 3 days for you to catch up to me.

Now here's the best part: What if I don't know how fast you're actually traveling? What if your car degrades faster than mine and eventually breaks down?

The analogy ends here. What happens if the technology growth we need doesn't keep up? What if it's an S-Curve? What if nanometers end

There are too many unknowns in this space, and people rushing to make major serious changes that could break the entire thing are getting upset that many others don't want to play this fast and loose.

For lack of a better example, stop trying to save this generations babies at the risk of breaking it and then the next 10 generations after it suffer. If you think a new blockchain can come along and do the same thing Bitcoin did if we do end up messing this up, you're in for a serious surprise when it doesn't happen and a centralized one takes over and doesn't go away.

"You guys are still thinking in crypto currency terms which is not the main directive of IOTA.  While most of the top 10 coins are only there through monetary speculation about who is going to become the most popular (who's got the fastest TPS, which exchange puts them in the top of the trading GUI), IOTA is trying to target the future of IoT.  The currency is merely a feature and not the main game.  Therefore, the incentive in running a node doesn't come from guy in China wanting to make a buck but from real corporations who have a stake in maintaining the network.  Porsche, for example, would absolutely be inclined to run nodes so their cars could feed back critical information to them (health checks, for eg). Then of course you have a myriad of applications around a IoT-enabled car including *truly* autonomous operation including self-recharge (micro payments as the car charges) and of course passengers being able to call the car (GPS position registered on the network) and then hired by passengers (automatic conversion of USD into IOTA and back again with smart contracts).  Of course, all these service providers will have a vested interest in providing many nodes - much like a mobile network provider - to make this happen.  And the technology to do this cheaply has now been developed.

If you are in the mindset of crypto being only applicable to H2H payments then the technology and design of a number of other cutting-edge cryptos targeting the IoT just wont make sense. ",1526767272

If you instead made the claim that early adopters (I'm talking about bitcoin owners, not miners) of Bitcoin will make an enormous profit if Bitcoin is adopted as a world reserve currency, then yes I'd say you are right. But early adopters also took great risk. With great risk comes great reward. Instead of being so jealous of early adopters, you should celebrate them. In terms of your question about 130 years vs. some other number, I don't really know what is more or less egalitarian.

Where to buy this bitcoin cash?,1526765210
"&gt; Do you also realize that smaller blocks can cause real users to stop using the chain? 

Sure, but thats why we're working on LN. This won't actually care how many users are there. In fact, it will only work better the larger it grows.

&gt; And how do big blocks cause centralization? It's not like miners running full nodes can't afford a $60 hard drive every now and then.

Its not about harddisk space. Never was (well, its on the bottom of the list of problems of larger blocks). Centralization happens with the time to validate and propagate blocks. If competing miners have to deal with excessive lag in beginning to mine the next block, the miner, who mined the current block, will be at a ever increasing advantage. This is only exacerbated by nodes being expensive to run. Mining centralization can in the worst case mean censored transactions.

Another huge concern is something as simple as who is going to serve SPV wallets - which scales horribly serverside. The fewer nodes, the more SPV wallets the worse the situation for the remaining nodes who serve SPV wallets. In the end its possible only huge server farms can serve SPV wallets - think you can connect for free? Possibly, but then you pay with your data.

Other concerns are that nodes a very important for developers when working on all kinds of stuff for bitcoin. And I don't mean bitcoin developers. I mean merchants or payments processors or whoever want to make some fun or innovative solution on top of bitcoin. Cant run a node? Sorry!

3) developement centralization? You serious? Try to count the number of devs for all cryptos and compare to how many bitcoin devs there are. Of course, you'll reply with ""they're all paid by blockstream"" no doubt, but in that case, please list who.

&gt; And Core are the ones who want people to stop using the blockchain

First, you're inventing motives here. No one wants people to stop using the blockchain, the problem is right now everyone cant use the blockchain! What the core developers want is to make sure everyone can use it, but not at the cost of centralizing it.

And you know core is a large group of people right?

"This is the Exchange Montreal and they buy and sell Bitcoin in person. Just scan your QR code and done.

They are excellent and its nice to have a face to face encounter, and their fees are cheaper than the ATMS which are all over Montreal now. 

All those screens are price charts or data about the mempool and just general info.

They use Segwit but my BECH 32 address didnt work with them last time I tried....I bet they get BECH 32 ready soon.

This place and the Bitcoin Embassy sort of changed my life, even just the people I meet there helped me learn so much. Im not rich or anything, but I think if it wasnt for the Bitcoin Embassy where you can walk in and ask questions comfortably I wouldnt have gotten my first Satoshi.

They opened right around the same time that the Bitcoin Embassy closed in Montreal, so I suspect its similar management or something. I recognize one staff member from the Bitcoin Embassy. 

Its set up really well. Here is the link, which is useful because you can see what the going rate is to buy or sell.

"&gt; How is that babbling? He’s right. You need to digitize the product before tokenizing it. 

In the Blockchain space, tokenzation is defined as the process of mapping real world assets into a digital token.  As the CEO of the self proclaimed best supply chain crypto, he should at least have an idea of IBM research in this space and how things are defined.  Sunny was asked a question about tokenzation but didn't even understand what that meant and starting saying the asset needed to be digitized first (no, we call that tokenzation) and then it can be tokenized (this is called monetization of the token).  

This is the problem with VeChain.  Sunny Lu talks out his ass and if he doesn't know what he's talking about, there should at least be some technical experts in the blockchain space.

&gt; Any critical thinker can now see that is what the celebration was about. **Fees were enough incentive to miners to secure the network without the block reward.** Especially if you read the tweet it comes from, you can clearly see that is the case. 

Therefore BTC needs high fees like that to secure the network as the block subsidy declines. Since core has made no plans to increase the blocksize even a little in light of this disaster, and instead are focusing on negligible improvements that require changes in user behavior like Schnorr and MAST, no significant on chain capacity improvements will happen to BTC and for BTC to be secure without the blocksize subsidy a handful of users will need to be paying $55 fees.

If the variable was named ""ETH"", then #2 wouldn't be clear because people could think that the actual ETH chain is being called over into the EOS world because that is something that happens.

 a)people/groups buying USDT to send to exchanges to buy other cryptos (which is an awful onramp to the market as it lets literally everybody front-run your order, costing you 10s of millions of $s in slippage)     
b) Tether buying crypto for themselves to sell. Basically stealing. Which is a great idea, it's terribly simple, would net them **billions** and is basically the perfect crime

I assume you are trolling/kidding. Obviously banks have nothing to do with bitcoin cash, or pretty much any cryptocurrency. And if you were referring to the exchanges as banks, well, they are not banks either. They are private companies. Companies listen to their customers if it makes them more money. Additionally, you do not have to use a centralized exchange (company) to do your trading. There are exchanges like Bisq that are completely peer-to-peer, and more in the works.

&gt; even BCH is slow 

BCH is instant with zero conf, with average wait time until first conformation being 5 minutes. Just because an exchange has poor policies doesn't mean it's the coin's fault.

&gt; expensive

Any fee on a BCH transaction, even 1 single satoshi per byte, will guarantee your transaction gets confirmed in the next block. BCH is one of the least expensive coins on the market. You should never pay more than a fraction of a penny for a regular transaction. What the exchanges charge you is completely different. They often charge a withdrawal fee, and some even charge a deposit fee.

&gt;  and unreliable.

Again, your transaction will always go through next block as long as you pay a bare minimum fee. I think you are conflating the coin with the unreliable _exchanges_.",1526762773

I am a software engineer so maybe something obvious to me is not obvious to others.  This is the default for a variable in the code.  It will never go live.  The SYS holder will literally never be affected.  All that matters is that it’s not EOS for clarity to developers and those who want to launch chains.  (And maybe also not BTC or ETH for confusion.). This is a complete non issue.,1526762431

"I don't disagree with supporting platforms that are FOSS, but I think the distinction here is that any platform that wants to legitimately compete with the Facebooks of the world needs to have economic incentives. That's why crypto-based applications hold such promise: they provide access to those incentives without requiring trust between the parties.",1526762397
"Absolutely, this is what adoption looks like. Everyone is welcome to participate in Bitcoin and everyone must adhere to the same consensus rules.",1526762359

"But if that gives them hope and happiness, all the more power to them. 

It may be deluded or misguided, agreed, but at the end of the day it's going to be very difficult, if not impossible, to educate everybody (or even half). 

Crypto will succeed only when people don't have to understand it. When the interface is reduced to null. 

And in the meantime, its better than gambling or playing the lottery as a hope to get rich quick. ",1526762270
"&gt;Miners ability to change protocol came later and was not part of the original design.

Any guess where these quotes are from?

""The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be  subverted by anyone able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote.""

""They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.""

&gt;We shouldn’t just trust miners just like we shouldn’t just trust other nodes. Running your own node let’s you trust no one.

SPV is trustless verification, based on PoW. There is no trust in Bitcoin, just incentives. If you don't think the incentives work, no ""full validating node"" will save you anyway because your chain can just be 51% attavked into oblivion. 51% attack uses *perfectly valid blocks* so validating your own blocks is no help. The key thing is that you can validate your transactions are bscked by sufficient work, and SPV lets you do that equally as well as any node.",1526762253

"You are aware that Bitfinex and Tether are owned by the same people? And noone said Tether are giving it away, if it goes to other exchanges, Tether could just be buying some crypto for themselves to keep/sell/hodl. Free money. You have seen in the news, practically every company that exists has done some dodgy dealings int he past. Why people think tetehr would not just print themselves 3 billion dollars for free is beyond me. Of course they would. When you steal 1 million you go to jail. When you steal 1 billion you become president.",1526762088
"I know altcoiners like this Myspace analogy but it isn't correct for Bitcoin. An analogy which is more correct would be to compare Bitcoin to the internet IP protocol or even to the Linux kernel.

In the best possible way I encourage you to keep reading and learning. A good place to start is to read ""The Internet of Money"" by Andreas M. Antonopoulos. You won't regret it.",1526762076
"This is a very interesting chart. But, keep in mind that this will not be the same in the future. This is when bitcoin was not worth very much, so of course the alt coins would be nowhere near the gains seen in bitcoin. Today, very good projects are coming out against bitcoins current price. So let’s say bitcoin is even only $5k (just to lowball it for stronger point), and a project comes out that is a 10x (like cardano for example since it’s still higher than 10x right now and its ATH was much higher than that), bitcoin would have to be worth $50k to be 0% profit/loss, while cardano holds that same satoshi value the entire time, which isn’t likely to happen at all. I’m not saying that bitcoin won’t be better to hold than many coins, because it will be. But at this point in time, you can gain much higher multipliers against bitcoin, by picking a strong project with a great team, advisors, and roadmap. And it doesn’t hurt if it’s super hyped : )  But again, this was cool to see the original post, to see how far bitcoin has come. ",1526762061

Guess what happens when 1 tether =0.0002 bitcoin on binance and 0.0001 on polonix.....    
Yep, thats right. People start to arbitrage it. People will buy as much USDT as they can on poloniex, bitfinex, kraken, anywhere they can and send it to Binance to make an easy buck. End result? More USDT in the market on Binance and the price settles down at it's equilibrium point, which is historically always around $1 for USDT",1526761535

* LN is not usable enough yet for it to be worthwhile right now IMO.
* The bitcointalk.org payments system is currently based on a *balances model*. In other words, when you pay to the given address, a balance associated with your account is updated, and then the system checks/debits your balance. This makes a lot of sense when using Bitcoin addresses for payments without any intermediary, as bitcointalk.org has always done. However, LN does not work naturally like this, and instead expects the *invoice model*, where users are sent to an invoice page for every logical payment, and they need to take further steps there (think BTCPay/BitPay). To move to the invoices model in order to be compatible with LN, I'd have to completely rewrite the payments system, which I may do eventually, but I'm not very eager to do.",1526760984

I still think that 95%+ out of 1600+ cryptos will fail, and putting money in BTC is much safer than altcoins, but look at BTC dominance chart. BTC lost a lot of market share, down from 75-95% to X-50%, and X has chances to dip below 30 for the first time in history. ETH Flippenning might not occur, since it's competitors will eat away some of it's market cap, but it did get very close in summer 2017, and there was no Bcash back then.

"The reason that people suggest that hardware wallets are safer is because with coinbase (or any exchange), you don't really have whatever asset you think you have... The EXCHANGE has that asset (you hope). What you have is an account with that exchange that SAYS you have that asset, and when you send or receive bitcoin, they're really receiving it and crediting your account. Not unlike a bank, if you don't have cash but you have a balance, you're trusting that the bank will do what you command them to do with your balance when you command them to do it. There's a lot of trust in both... You're trusting Coinbase to send and receive {digital asset} on your behalf when you command them to, just like you trust a bank to do the same (think online banking or wiring money).

The biggest difference is that the bank is answerable to the government and the federal reserve with regard to regulation, and your balance is insured usually up to $250k...

If your bitcoin exchange went bankrupt, your balance usually is forfeit.

"Volume indicates the money that’s being pumped around. Hi volume in combination with price spike indicates bullish behavior. Price spike with no volume increase doesn’t mean a thing.

"Monero is great, but its practicality needs serious work. I wish I could buy it somewhere directly with USD. 

Once it is practical hopefully the anonymity part will become a requirement of any successful crypto. The dark markets bit is holding it back, but it really shouldn't because cash is used by everyone without suffering stigma that reduces its adoption. 

Crypto in general also needs to be easier to use securely. Once any idiot can use crypto it will be adopted.

"" I don't care about it's price"" ""[If BTC is taken from the #1 spot] I will sell all my crypto for fiat and never touch it again"" Pick one.

Crypto is short for cryptocurrency. It has been designed to be a currency since the genesis block. On ETH (and now BCH has the capability) you can tokenize assets, another form of currency.

""Paying by debit card is 100 times easier and less fees than paying with a any cryptocurrency."" 

False. CC's generally charge 2.5% per transaction. The end user does not see this fee because the merchants build it into their prices.

"&gt; I wrote this to another person. What users? Who has even heard of tether, except those using crypto exchanges? And why are these users holding 3 billion dollars worth of assets in tether accounts? Why would they do this?

The same could be said for any crypto coin. Ripple, Tron, Bitconnect etc. Who has heard of those besides crypto users, who are these users that have put billions into those coins, why are they buying it, where did they get the money from, how did they get it, why are they holding it... etc etc. 

&gt; I agree that if USDT has cash backing,

It has cash backing it and it's been that way for over a year and every month people have said its a fraud yet it has maintained its peg.

&gt;  What I find preposterous is that you think tether has 3 billion worth of customer accounts from people who want to transfer money, and are leaving that money in the accounts.

I don't think it's preposterous at all, $3billion is $10,000 on 300,000 users. Binance alone has over a million users. Tether is very useful as a stable coin that users can trade into from any crypto and sit in until the bear market is over.. The alternative is to sell BTC on localbitcoin for cash to deposit back into your bank then spend money/time transfering it back to gdax to buy more BTC. 

&gt; Also the tether 1:1 peg wouldn't work if they had to wait for customer deposits. Look into how china pegs the yuan to the US dollar. It would have to work the same way. If too many people go to buy USDT, they'd absolutely have to issue more on demand otherwise tether would be worth more. This is why tether is issued in bulk when the coin market goes down.

Yes we saw this in the early days of Tether in early 2017 when bitfinex banking went down and btc was trading at a 10% premium. Arbitrators stepped in and were physically moving fiat back and forth between bitfenix and kraken banks in Taiwan. Imagine taking a taxi ride which paid you 10% of your capital each time. 

&gt; This is why tether is issued in bulk when the coin market goes down.

Or... because the market cap goes down, buyers see an opportunity for their cheap ripple or tron to get in and the demand for Tether goes up. 

&gt; This only works if tether is backed 1:1 by dollars.

All stable coins are zero sum. What I said previous will work with any of them. Soon you conspiracy theories will have TUSD where you can have that rubber auditor stamp to say its 1:1 

&gt;  The only way you can raise more money on demand to peg USDT to a dollar is by issuing more when the demand rises.

That's what zero sum implies. As demand rises the supply is increased. We have this in regular finance too, when the banks were going bust in 2007/9 there was demand for dollars and the government stepped in and printed lots through the QE program which prevented a bear market and a decade later the economy is at new ATH

&gt;  You can't wait for customer deposits on their money transfer service, and you couldn't just deflate when money when people cashed out of their tether accounts. 

I don't see any issue. Again it's speculating on what people do with the tether which I don't care for. I care for the macro effects, If users don't want it they don't have to use it, just use localbitcoin or sea shells to sit out of crypto. My original point remains, stable coins are zero sum regardless if you are trading USDT/TUSD/DAi/GdaxUSD/Crypto as long as the USD's remain in crypto bank accounts then the marketcap is constant. Just because there is more sellers one day and the price goes down isn't the important signal, the increase of USD is.

&gt; The problem is you have no understanding of how pegging works.

I absolutely do know how it works, first hand too on some of the premium spikes and the discounts. The problem is that you're blinded by tether conspiracy and don't want to believe the peg can remain. Rest assured it's going to be resolved with TUSD so you can have a suit tell you ""YES the USD is there"".  And then we can get back to my original points. 

&gt; I'm not trying to be mean, but you really should read up on how pegging something to the dollar would have to work.

I'm not trying to be mean but perhaps you should stop listening to conspiracy theorist. 


&gt;  You also don't understand how USDT would have to enter the market.

What??! I know exactly who to contact to get USDT and have received USDT directly. I was approved by pgp long before you was even in crypto, I'm a bitfinex shareholder for crying aloud... Jesus, fucking christ, get the fuk out of here kid. The level of idiocy on here is really a test to someones patients. 


&gt; It doesn't just magically get there. It has to be exchanged, and Tether the company needs to get cash for it or receive some sort of payment for it.

"Disclaimer: I'm a moderator of QRL (The Quantum Resistant Ledger), so take what I say with a grain of salt if you will.

The best paper in this area has been [Quantum Attacks on Bitcoin, and how to protect against them](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10377) (2017-10-28) which models the progress of gate speed, gate fidelity and overall qubits to make the statement: ""On the other hand, the elliptic curve signature scheme used by Bitcoin is much more at risk, and could be completely broken by a quantum computer as early as 2027, by the most optimistic estimates"".

I'm not going to lie, 9 years seems like a long ways away, but cryptographers work with generally long timelines, which why [they're standardizing now](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Post-Quantum-Cryptography/Round-1-Submissions) and have been [talking about it in an organized fashion for a long time, ~2006](https://pqcrypto.org/). It's also why [google has been experimenting with PQ Crypto since 2016 in Google chrome](https://security.googleblog.com/2016/07/experimenting-with-post-quantum.html).

What I'm getting at is preparations for both centralized and decentralized systems need to start now or soon, and decentralized systems even earlier. While 5 years does seem unrealistic, this isn't something that I think bitcoin should be waiting *until* it's a problem, especially as it approaches a trillion dollar marketcap (speculation, but this year?). To put another way, the chance of a black swan event might be low, but the severity would be very high. I wont get into difficulties of migration to a Post-Quantum scheme.

I guess, I use BTC day to day (or at least week to week) and would like to see a *precautionary* approach rather than a reactionary one.

"What do you mean by currency risk? Volatility? The gambler buys FUN with Fiat, and plays with the FUN. The FUN will always be in his possession, he will never give it to the casino. 

He will however stake fun in the state channel, which he opens together with the casino, and the casino will stake a much higher amount of fun, about 100x, in the state channel. So if the player wins a large bet, there is enough casino fun in the state channel to cover the winnings. At the end, when closing the state channel, the state channel 'decides' how much fun goes to the gambler and what goes back to the casino. At that point the gambler could convert back to Fiat.

At the moment there is of course a risk that the FUN could be worth more or less after the session.

"There's a lot going on here. We don't and probably never will have a full understanding of what entities control what amount of hashpower.

What we do know is there are groups that control large amounts, groups that control small amounts, and most of them aggregate into pools.

The issue is we have some pools that are primarily composed of ""single miners"". The entire pool could be a single miner, or a single miner could split themselves up into multiple pools,  but masquerade as not related.

For example, Bitmain's mining operation is a ""single miner"". They could split their hash up however they want into whatever pools they want, and they can mine alternative chains.

We're already seeing that now. Bitmain is essentially keeping Bitcoin Cash alive while everyone is mislead *(or pretends)* there are a lot of miners mining it, but they *(Bitmain)* mostly still mine Bitcoin.

So which one are they really ""voting"" for?

There is some variance in mining, but there's also variance in how much hashpower Bitmain dedicates to Bitcoin Cash. They added an easy visual toggle on their website for miners to ""actively switch chains"", but with that chaotic EDA BCH through in removed, there's no drastic variance like there used to be so there's no real incentive to switch back and forth.

Most of that variance comes from hardware going on and off, however distributed or centralized that hardware is. Operations lose power, upgrade sections of their infrastructure, relocate, etc.

&gt;It seems to me that no crypto can really claim to own hashrate

This is true. Hashrate isn't owned by a decentralized network. I think what we'll see over time though, is the incentive to play hashrate ""games"" like this will be severely diminished, and all will aggregate towards a single coin.

Choosing to use your hash on a different chain is the same thing as choosing to use your manufacturing plants to create ASICs for coin XYZ instead of ASICS for sha256 (Bitcoin). It's just a business decision that will generally follow the perceived value of mining whatever coin with whatever hash.

I say perceived because there are other factors at play. Bitmain doesn't sell most of the BCH they mine. If they did the price would crumble. They're betting on two things:

1. The price pumps and they get more bang for their buck.
2. It succeeds.

I think 1 is very likely, and 2 is very unlikely.

As for remaining profitable, Bitmain is mining BCH at a loss currently, and selling it would be even more of a loss by knocking the price down even further, so clearly they have other intentions and it isn't *just* the price that motivates miners behavior.

Again I think this behavior is less likely to occur over time, and I also think the only future risk after this is put in the past are governments seizing hash control and doing what they want with it.

When you're the money makers, ***the real money makers***, you aren't interested in Bitcoin mining profits, you're interested in stopping and or controlling the protocol, so assuming the incentives are always in line ""because profits"" isn't the best way to go.[**Honesty doesn't exist.**](https://twitter.com/StopAndDecrypt/status/992196408441802753)",1526758142

I'm genuinely curious. Bitcoin isn't the first deflationary currency and the blockchain isn't the first digital database. Both things fit in fine with my ideas. A currency deflation has happened before and it's not good for the economy. Digital databases have been used for years and the blockchain is a laughably stupid example of it.

"Yes reduced spending and a reduction in jobs would follow. 

Better is entirely subjective because what is ""good"" or ""right"" is entirely subjective. Anyone who understands the consequences and how they align with their beliefs are perfectly qualified to say what is ""better""

So yes the end result a deflationary currency would have on society would certainly be ""better"" in my opinion.

I also highly question your assumption that ""If financial experts knew it was better, that's what governments would be doing."" ; in fact I believe assumption this to be dangerously naive. ""Better"" is subjective and it is naive to believe that governments will do what is in the best interests of those they govern. From both a historical and modern standpoint it would be far more rational to assume that governments will do what is in the best interests of themselves and their acquaintances. Sometimes that aligns with the interests of the governed; often it does not.

Yes; what other people care about impacts me; but their beliefs in no way impact my beliefs or understanding. I'm not interested in ""pitching"" Bitcoin to anyone who doesn't care in decentralization or deflationary currency/assets. In fact I hope those people who don't care about these properties stay away from Bitcoin for as long as possible.

Bitcoins revolutionary breakthrough is not about ""instant transactions"" or free payments. We already have that with fiat. Paying by credit card is a superior user experience and will be for some time. People are not converting to Bitcoin because their CC isn't convenient.

Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a theory in psychology proposed by Abraham Maslow in his 1943 paper “A Theory of Human Motivation” in Psychological Review. Maslow subsequently extended the idea to include his observations of humans' innate curiosity. His theories parallel many other theories of human developmental psychology, some of which focus on describing the stages of growth in humans. Maslow used the terms ""physiological"", ""safety"", ""belonging and love"", ""esteem"", ""self-actualization"", and ""self-transcendence"" to describe the pattern that human motivations generally move through.

"Hi, I’ve seen some good comments from you before..

Quick question on this topic.  When you and others say that BCH has centralized mining and doesn’t have the infrastructure; what about the shared mining pool?  I watch fork.lol from time to time and see the hashrate on both chains experiencing variance as miners move from block chain to block chain chasing profits elsewhere.  

It seems to me that no crypto can really claim to own hashrate, they may just happen to have it at the moment and need to do all they can to remain profitable to the miners.  

Does this make sense to you or am I missing something else on the centralized mining/lack of infrastructure debate?",1526754350
"Story by Jessica Levy   

&gt;What if there was a way to drastically improve the likelihood that breast cancer could be detected early?   
Mammograms are a good start, but even regular mammograms are far from a guarantee. Their false negative rate is alarmingly high; doctors only detect cancer 80 percent of the time, according to the American Cancer Society. That means that, statistically, for every five women screened that have breast cancer, one will go undiagnosed.   
Now, experts are exploring a tool that may help, though it may seem a bit unusual to those who know its history: blockchain technology.   
Blockchain is best known for its use in verifying transactions in Bitcoin, a popular cryptocurrency. However, the new technology's novel approach to security and anonymity is generating quiet excitement and innovation in the health-care industry as well. That's because a secure and anonymous approach to sharing medical information is a researcher's dream come true.   
Here's how it works: A blockchain is a ""database on steroids,"" says Christian Ferri, president and CEO of Blockstar. ""Think of it as a digital ledger where data is recorded not by one centralized entity, but through a consensus mechanism of all the computers that are part of that blockchain. Because of the decentralized nature of this technology, blockchain allows the data recorded to be immutable, visible, and hard to hack.""   
That's because assets on a blockchain cannot be accessed without encryption keys, explains Global Blockchain Technologies Corporation President Shidan Gouran. ""Any information that resides on a blockchain is encrypted, and as such cannot be used by someone with ill intentions,"" Gouran explains.   
It's easy enough to see how, in the case of breast cancer research, increased access to medical information could move the needle in a number of ways. For one thing, it could encourage more people to share their genome data with the scientific community without the risk of the information getting abused. And the more data researchers have, the more likely they are to achieve breakthroughs.   
""Blockchain brings with it great security enhancements, which is very important when you're talking about an individual's genome data,"" explains Alexander Lowry, a finance professor at Gordon College in Massachusetts. ""If you combine blockchain with cloud computing, genome sequencing, artificial intelligence, and big data analytics to medicine, you can accelerate breakthroughs.""   
Genome data has already led to a major achievement in breast cancer treatment, when scientists discovered that there were actually different types of breast cancer. That led researchers to approach their search for a cure differently. That search paid off when just last year, after successful clinical trials, the FDA approved a new treatment for a specific type of the disease known as HER2-positive breast cancer. And this was achieved in the current siloed world of medical research.   
Now imagine a blockchain-backed system that has the capability to create a global medical ledger. Genome data can be stored on that ledger, allowing the information to be widely accessed while at the same time being incredibly difficult to hack. You could also theoretically include a vast trove of mammogram readings from those with cancer in this system. That kind of data could help push forward efforts to use artificial intelligence for breast cancer screenings. Since AI gets smarter and more accurate by ""learning"" from as many data points as possible, more sample readings are critical to improving its capabilities.   
Organizations like BreastWeCan.org, for example, are asking women to donate their mammograms or other breast imaging scans for research purposes, using blockchain to secure millions of scans.   
That could be game-changing. With improved accuracy, artificial intelligence could assist radiologists reviewing each mammogram, flagging potentially cancerous results that may have otherwise been missed for human review. And remember, discovering breast cancer in its earliest stages literally saves lives.   
Using blockchain technology for such purposes may seem like a no-brainer — but the logistics make the move more complicated. The concept of using blockchain for non-financial transactions is a difficult one, largely because it takes a decentralized network of thousands people running powerful software to create and maintain the blockchain. Running that software comes at a cost. And for a medical blockchain, it is unclear who would take on the responsibility and expense of running the software that cryptographically seals the information into a block. (One possible solution: Perhaps medical researchers could run the software as a type of ""payment"" for their access to the anonymous, population-level data that could push their research forward.)   
While the many possibilities that blockchain advances are certainly exciting, experts such as venture capitalist Scott Amyx caution against overselling what blockchain can do. ""Blockchain directly will not detect or prevent cancer,"" he stresses. The technology is fundamentally simply ""a form of cryptography or security that addresses mutual authentication in a trustless, decentralized network.""   
Even as he warns against getting too excited, though, he goes on to list even more possibilities for using blockchain in the fight against breast cancer, or cancer in general. ""Through the use of wearables, medical wearables, diet and fitness apps, and clinically administered data, [blockchain] could authenticate and maintain a ledger of your holistic lifestyle to determine your chances of developing breast cancer,"" Amyx says.   
For the one in eight American women who will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime, and for the 40,000 lives that breast cancer will take this year, even an idea that still has kinks to work out is enough to create hope.   
Blockchain is not a cure, but it has the potential to be an important technological tool in the fight against breast cancer. In the end, it's up to human innovators to put that tool to good use.",1526754349

"Yes everybody knows that cars run on gas or phones have radio frequencies. But that doesnt tell you how it works. Im talking about the detail of how it works. Blockchain can be explained in a general sense like you just explained above about cars and phones.

Or how your phone takes the data you input on a text and breaks into code&gt;Which is then sent to a transmitter&gt; which is then sent to the recipient in code&gt;then the recipients phone takes the code and puts into text.

"&gt;Yes we do know that, maybe the USDT just sits in the users account forever. However from tether expanding we KNOW USD has been committed to crypto until tether deflates.

I wrote this to another person.  What users?  Who has even heard of tether, except those outside of crypto exchanges?  And why are these users holding 3 billion dollars worth of assets in tether accounts?  Why would they do this?

&gt;Irrelevant when the USD in tether remained constant, doesn't matter if someone gets ETH for 1USDT or 1000USDT because that USD will still remain in crypto until USDT deflates.

I agree that if USDT has cash backing, it doesn't matter.  What I find preposterous is that you think tether has 3 billion worth of customer accounts from people who want to transfer money, and are leaving that money in the accounts.  

Also the tether 1:1 peg wouldn't work if they had to wait for customer deposits.  Look into how china pegs the yuan to the US dollar.  It would have to work the same way.  If too many people go to buy USDT, they'd absolutely have to issue more on demand.  This is why tether is issued in bulk when the coin market goes down. 

&gt;It's zero sum just like accounting or even the expansion of the universe. Expand Tether then the whole market inflates, contract tether and the whole market shrinks. you can plot this vs the marketcap.

This only works if tether is backed 1:1 by dollars.  The only way you can raise more money on demand to peg USDT to a dollar is by issuing more when the demand rises.  You can't wait for customer deposits on their money transfer service, and you couldn't just deflate when money when people cashed out of their tether accounts.  Tether the company doesn't even have the tether any more to deflate. The users on the exchange do.  The people on the exchanges who use tether to buy coins with it have the tether.

Think.  In order to deflate tether you have to take someone buying coins with tether, somehow give them those coins and then destroy the tether.  You can't just make tether disappear.

&gt;What? what??!?!?! zero sum doesn't mean unchanged, it means equilibrium. If you don't know these basics then you really shouldn't be commenting...

The problem is you have no understanding of how pegging works.  You don't grasp how deflation and inflation of the tether would have to work.  I'm not trying to be mean, but you really should read up on how pegging something to the dollar would have to work.

cash pool rely order next agree zero modify run race gap early 

problem proof attack since ability end entire know sign post fee find

If we use a 24 word seed, again, using the order in the whitepaper we get these lists (depending on which order you combine the two lists, or just all 24 words in the order in the paper):
 
cash problem proof pool attack rely since ability order next end entire know sign agree post zero modify run fee find race gap early

problem proof attack since ability end entire know sign post fee find cash pool rely order next agree zero modify run race gap early

They claim it is for decentralization but I pose this argument that when Satoshi talked about 'decentralization' he did not involve relay/full/non-mining nodes at all.

---

Decentralization is one of Bitcoin's main selling points. But what does it actually mean? Skip to the end for the tl;dr

**What is centralization**    
As we all know from reading everything Satoshi wrote about his design for Bitcoin from satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org, Bitcoin was finalized and born in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. In this event many normal people lost money while banking executives made more and more. 

**Where does centralization come from**       
These banks, much like the bank you probably use today, are centralized. That is, they alone control everything that happens. There is one database which has everyone's funds, if they decide you are a terrorist or something they can stop you from access your money. They can stop you from making transactions. Even if you have done nothing wrong they can stop payment on your transactions without your consent, lock you out of your funds, and monitor everything you do. 


**What  is decentralization**       
By splitting up the 'power' that a bank has we decentralize it. There is no longer any one single entity that can control txs and funds. This way no one is 'in charge' and no one can give themselves bonuses while other people lose money. This decentralization is a founding point of Bitcoin.

**Where does decentralization come from**       
Instead of one company controlling the database of funds like in the centralized model, in Bitcoin's decentralized model there are many people who can all contribute to the database and transaction processing without any one entity having full control. In Bitcoin and other POW based cryptocurrencies this decentralization is achieved by having a number of *mining nodes* who are not affiliated. As long as no group of miners controls more than 51% of the hashpower, bitcoin remains decentralized.

---


**So only mining nodes contribute to decentralization, then what about non-mining nodes**      
Non-mining nodes, full nodes, relay nodes, or storage nodes are often misunderstood to be part of decentralization. This can be easily cleared up by understanding the above information and then understanding that a non-mining node has no *power* if the majority of hashpower were to do something they didn't like. 

**I thought everyone was supposed to run a full node**      
This is another common misunderstanding, in the very beginning Satoshi did intend for everyone to run a node with 4 functions. He is very clear when he explains how this is not the way for the system to function in the future. The plan of bitcoin is that everyone can make trustless peer-to-peer transactions on a decentralized system. Not that everyone would run a home server with the whole blockchain. The business and bitcoin companies that need to have personal and instant validation of their tx can run a full nodes. Random sampling is a tried and trusted method, those unable to host their own relay node would be easily able to verify their transactions with overwhelming mathematically certainty.

**So who wants to run a full node then**     
Anyone who wants to can, it's like the Olympics, 'anyone can compete but few feel the need to'. There is no reason the network should be ground to a halt and made useless so people who can't afford to make a transaction would be able to run a full node on a 20 year old computer over a dial up connection. Bitcoin was meant to scale with technology, not become left behind. 


**What are the 4 functions that all early nodes did**       
When you read the design of Bitcoin which we all invested into, the design on which so much was built, the one at nakamotoinstitute.org, you see Satoshi mention the word 'node' many times. What we today call a full node or non-mining node usually fulfills one of those functions, that of storing the database. Finding other peers for connecting to is done by full nodes and pool operators. Sending and receiving bitcoin, aka a wallet, was also a function every node had. Finally generating coins by putting new transactions into the blockchain was the 4th thing all nodes used to do. Today these 4 actions are largely compartmentalized, as they should be in any good computer science project.

---


This is Bitcoin, some people are unhappy with the way Bitcoin was designed, well I suppose Bitcoin is simply not for those people and they should maybe find something else to do.


I hope you've all learned something today about how Bitcoin is decentralized, what is means, and how we got there.

tl;dr Banks control all txs and accounts with one database and are centralized, Bitcoin has many miners who perform this actions to make it decentralized. Non-mining nodes don't contribute to decentralization. ",1526752876

"I'll answer your questions. 

what you need to look for when researching cryptos. First of all what is the crypto and the what is it trying to achieve? Who are the developers? Are they experienced or are they new? Do they have a plan? Do they have test nets or a mainnet? Is there a white paper? If there isn't that's ok a white paper isn't going to be the one thing that makes or breaks your investment. Do they have a clear plan on how to achieve their goals? Do they have a Web presence? Is it a private coin? Is there any news regarding the coin? Do they have any major investors? Pretty much every question you ask about a stock investment apply it to crypto. I don't preach the white papers because that's not going to tell you to invest or not. It gives you a general direction of where the crypto is headed and what kind of problems the crypto aims to solve. 

Taxes vary on jurisdiction you have to look into that on your own. 

Your biggest mistake is coming here hoping the ppl here will tell you what to invest in. Here's a hint, nobody knows shit. You'll get a thousand different answers and 99 percent of them are ppl hyping up a shit coin they lost money on and are trying to get enough ppl to buy in for the price to break even. Or the ppl will be telling you biased info about a coin because tribalism is prevalent here and its pathetic.

What I did was I bought eth on coinbase and transferred over to binance where I bought alts with eth. My long term hold is off the exchange but I left some there for day trading which has trippled what I left on binance. Day trading can work if you're not emotional and if you have a plan that you stick to and you have an exit plan if things go sour. 

A safe investment is to buy eth and bitcoin on coinbase and hold those for the long term. Keep in mind though in this environment no investment is safe. It can all come crashing down in 10 minutes and no one would no why. 

Invest what you are comfortable losing and nothing more. If you're ok with losing 2000 put that in. If you're ok with losing 200 put that in. Nothing more than what your comfortable losing. Keep in mind the fees of every transfer.

The biggest piece of advice I can give you is this. Don't listen to any one on reddit or 4chan on what to buy and for fucks sake don't ask us to shill you a coin. Hell don't even listen to my advice if you don't want to. Trust yourself and no one else. If I listened to these ppl I would've stopped day trading months ago and would've missed out on all my profits. Only make moves your comfortable with. And have patience. One of the main problems here is idiots pumping money into a coin hoping it'll moon the next day. Meteoric rises like we saw in December and January probably won't happen ever again and if it does it won't be for a long time. The underlying foundation can't support a growth like that and the consequential crash proved it. Investments in this area are all speculative. No one can really tell you with 100 percent certainty why a coin has a value it has. That's where you do your own research to figure it out yourself. 
Btc and eth are the safest coins to hold but there are others as well that you will find. I've found one that I'm very confident in and am holding for a very long time. It had already increased in price since I bought in and the team is doing incredible things. I won't shill the coin because I have no need too.

Skycoin is not just a  p2p meshnet, is actually a Software Defined Network.

"They claim it is for decentralization but I pose this argument that when Satoshi talked about 'decentralization' he did not involve relay/full/non-mining nodes at all.

---

Decentralization is one of Bitcoin's main selling points. But what does it actually mean? Skip to the end for the tl;dr

**What is centralization**    
As we all know from reading everything Satoshi wrote about his design for Bitcoin from satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org, Bitcoin was finalized and born in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. In this event many normal people lost money while banking executives made more and more. 

**Where does centralization come from**       
These banks, much like the bank you probably use today, are centralized. That is, they alone control everything that happens. There is one database which has everyone's funds, if they decide you are a terrorist or something they can stop you from access your money. They can stop you from making transactions. Even if you have done nothing wrong they can stop payment on your transactions without your consent, lock you out of your funds, and monitor everything you do. 


**What  is decentralization**       
By splitting up the 'power' that a bank has we decentralize it. There is no longer any one single entity that can control txs and funds. This way no one is 'in charge' and no one can give themselves bonuses while other people lose money. This decentralization is a founding point of Bitcoin.

**Where does decentralization come from**       
Instead of one company controlling the database of funds like in the centralized model, in Bitcoin's decentralized model there are many people who can all contribute to the database and transaction processing without any one entity having full control. In Bitcoin and other POW based cryptocurrencies this decentralization is achieved by having a number of *mining nodes* who are not affiliated. As long as no group of miners controls more than 51% of the hashpower, bitcoin remains decentralized.

---


**So only mining nodes contribute to decentralization, then what about non-mining nodes**      
Non-mining nodes, full nodes, relay nodes, or storage nodes are often misunderstood to be part of decentralization. This can be easily cleared up by understanding the above information and then understanding that a non-mining node has no *power* if the majority of hashpower were to do something they didn't like. 

**I thought everyone was supposed to run a full node**      
This is another common misunderstanding, in the very beginning Satoshi did intend for everyone to run a node with 4 functions. He is very clear when he explains how this is not the way for the system to function in the future. The plan of bitcoin is that everyone can make trustless peer-to-peer transactions on a decentralized system. Not that everyone would run a home server with the whole blockchain. The business and bitcoin companies that need to have personal and instant validation of their tx can run a full nodes. Random sampling is a tried and trusted method, those unable to host their own relay node would be easily able to verify their transactions with overwhelming mathematically certainty.

**So who wants to run a full node then**     
Anyone who wants to can, it's like the Olympics, 'anyone can compete but few feel the need to'. There is no reason the network should be ground to a halt and made useless so people who can't afford to make a transaction would be able to run a full node on a 20 year old computer over a dial up connection. Bitcoin was meant to scale with technology, not become left behind. 


**What are the 4 functions that all early nodes did**       
When you read the design of Bitcoin which we all invested into, the design on which so much was built, the one at nakamotoinstitute.org, you see Satoshi mention the word 'node' many times. What we today call a full node or non-mining node usually fulfills one of those functions, that of storing the database. Finding other peers for connecting to is done by full nodes and pool operators. Sending and receiving bitcoin, aka a wallet, was also a function every node had. Finally generating coins by putting new transactions into the blockchain was the 4th thing all nodes used to do. Today these 4 actions are largely compartmentalized, as they should be in any good computer science project.

This is Bitcoin, some people are unhappy with the way Bitcoin was designed, well I suppose Bitcoin is simply not for those people and they should maybe find something else to do.


I hope you've all learned something today about how Bitcoin is decentralized, what is means, and how we got there.

"A seed doesn't ""contain"" keys, it produces them. The creation is done using one way functions, so it is not possible to derive the seed phrase from existing keys, although there are possible ways you could serialize your existing keys using a word dictionary, existing wallets using the BIP-32 and BIP-39 standards create the seed first, then derive the keys.

The seed, created by BIP-39, is made from 128 to 256 bits of random entropy. A checksum of `truncate(sha256(entropy), size(entropy)/32)` is appended to the end, making for example 132 bits, or 264 bits.

This sequence is then broken into 11 bit chunks, and each 11 bits represents an index in a fixed dictionary of words.

So to regenerate the entropy from the words, you find the index of each word in the dictionary, append that index into a sequence of bits, then finally, the size/32 bits should be truncated from the end, as they're the checksum on the entropy. You'd run sha256 on the bit sequence and confirm that the checksum matches the first size/32 bits of the hash.

HMAC-SHA512 is then used with the seed entropy as the key and ""mnemonic&lt;PASSPHRASE&gt;"" as the salt, with ""&lt;PASSPHRASE&gt;"" being determined by the user. The first 256 bits are used as the master private key. The second 256 bits are used as the ""chain code"", for generating further private keys in a deterministic way. Essentially, the master private key is concatenated with an index, in normalized 4-byte form, meaning 2^32 possible child keys, and then HMAC-SHA512 is performed again, using the chain code as the secret. The full process of this is defined in BIP-32, but you can have an arbitrary nested hierarchy of wallets because each HMAC produces another private key and chain code which effectively work as the seed for another possible 2^32 keys.

For detailed reading, you should check out Andreas Antonopoulos's book ""Mastering Bitcoin"", as it has examples of deriving these using Python and libbitcoin. There are several other implementations in different languages. If you check the [BIP](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips) they list various implementations at the end of the document.",1526746735

"&gt; Yes that's how it works and you haven't stated a problem


It means there's active incentive to *not* use your *currency* for anything, but holding it in your wallet. Essentially PoS could all be ERC20 forever, since they're maybe not used for anything ever anyway. 

Now to what degree that incentive will actually play out, I don't know. Goes back to the same shit you asked me. 


&gt;  Can you point to any PoS attacks that have happened?

No I can't. At the same time I do not see any worthwhile PoS coin having taken off, or being used at all, for anything, besides speculation and being an ERC20 shitstain in Crypto. We don't have a PoS coin in the top5, right? EOS is still ERC20, testphase, bullshit, doesn't count. 


Time will tell how much better/worse these coins actually are. I don't see anything promising, besides Oroborous. 


&gt; Again, you just vaguely say it doesn't work. 


No, you misunderstand. I'm a believer too, I have invested lots in Cardano myself. or had. I just want to see some actual work and progress now. 


Everybody is good at screaming how their theory is the best. Let the best one win in practise, is what I'm saying. 


Further I just wanted to mention, that nothing is for free. 

PoS isn't better at everything than PoW, for free. It has to give up certain qualities PoW has, at the same time the most obvious benefit to PoS would be that no mining equipment would be essential. 

Time will tell. I'm not hating on PoS, I was hating on the guy who made the thread, because his video is fucking terrible. 


&gt; How long is the list of 51% attacks on PoW coins?


You tell me, hell, why not link me to something that actually looks at such a statistic? 

Last time I checked, 51% happen so rarely, if ever, because they're not profitable at all. You can rewrite a transactions, better make sure it's a big transaction, and that's it. Why don't you tell me, what coin was 51% attacked? 


Monero had 80% of their hashrate from ASICs. Still, despite annoucing to the world, that they will change algo to become ASIC resistant, the ASICs in Monero still didn't 51% the network. Because they're not one entitiy and because the attack itself is not profitable. 


How did that all play out? ASIC Monero is live. Original real Monero still works as good as before, only now it's GPUs securing the network. 


&gt; So how about PoW that you presumably think is better?

I never said that. I'm not crazy. I'm not Adam Back, or Nick Szabo, and I'm not Vitalik either. I leave that to the people that actually know their shit. 

Until that time some of the PoS-party boys can show me why their system is much better, I will simply be neutral and say PoS is not a real thing yet, because it isn't. It's still nerdtheory and no one project has yet to real proven themselves as secure tech. Bitcoin is secure. Is your PoS shitcoin secure? 


&gt; How did you feel about 80% of the hashpower being controlled by unknown ASICs for up to a year? 


Told you about that already. No 51% attack occured, because they're not profitable. 80% of the network was ASICs, that doesn't mean that *one person* had control to all ASIC nodes at the same time. They're still spread out, ASIC or not. 


&gt; How do you feel that it's extremely wasteful and damaging to the environment?


I don't even filter my trash and honestly couldn't care less about the environment. The last aspect that will be relevant to me, honestly. Sad thing to read for Hippies, but you gotta deal with it. I don't fucking care. Not to mention, all the other shit that costs stuff too. Again, nothing is for free. That PC you're using right now is using electricity to run. Why not stop, and be more green towards environment? Is it solar powered? If it is, why not use the energy in better ways, than waste time on Reddit? See where I'm going? Whether or not you agree is irrelevant, I hope you can somwhat see my point here. You can make waste arguments for literally *everything*. We all have waste. PoS maybe has no real waste, but then again, it's not more than nerd theory at the moment, so the fuck cares?


&gt;  Is it problematic that PoW has screwed up the GPU market and ASIC manufacturing is centralized?

Screwed up GPU market ... how exactly did they do that? Link me to specfic stuff please. Because last time I checked both Nvidia and AMD are having great fucking sales, ever since Crypto. I'm pretty sure both are relatively positive towards Crypto, and it's the sad nerd games, who I don't give no single fuck about, that cry thait some of their high-end GPUs are a couple of bucks more expensive.

ASIC is centralized at the moment. Hopefully that changes. S9 is no longer the only thing on the market is it. There's the Halong miner. Maybe others and hopefully more in the future too, I don't know.

There's 24 words within the border (all of which can be used in the bip39 sys),
here they are listed in the order they appear in the original white paper:

one main still network power come process since size ability paper coin next issue way know model able modify speed help old place want

This didn't work when I tested it though.

Interestingly, all the math formulas in this are in the Whitepaper (last page) and the dates correlate exactly with the years and months of the references at the bottom of the PDF (e.g. ""199905"" = the 2nd reference published May 1999)

I believe all the numbers and equations are a distraction from the real answer, which is a 24 mnemonic code. 

To get access to the wallet / test word orders. You can download the Electrum Wallet and then put in the public address of this account (3CcxyPhyvyc3S9UuPfu42GNZLvVVV11Uk8). 

Then, you can go to https://iancoleman.io/bip39/ to test out your phrases (options for 12 - 24 word mnemonic phrases) which in combination with the public key will give you access to the private key.

Then, you go back to your Electrum wallet, under 'wallet' ---&gt; private keys ---&gt; sweep you can place in the private key and get full access to the wallet and send the 1BTC to yourself :)

If you are broke or living from paycheck to paycheck, or saddled with debt, or have tiny savings for a rainy days (i.e. if you are 99%)a tool that gives you an ability to transfer value will appear irrelevant.

That statement however, has never been true. So what's your point? 


Yea, mining is incentivized, but if it absolutely wasn't, nobody would bother to mine at all. Incentive is not as strong as you make it out to be, since otherwise we'd all be miners, because it would be so profitable. 


&gt; In PoS the coins themselves are effectively mining equipment.

"The celebrating of high transaction fees is something that was taken out of context and used multiple times as propaganda. 

Incentive plays a huge role in bitcoin. Incentive is how bitcoin allows all participants to work and stay honest.

For miners, the block reward is part of their incentive to secure the network. Without that incentive, we would not have bitcoin. Now, eventually the block reward is going to go away.

At that point, the incentive to secure the network for miners comes from collecting transaction fees. 

Any critical thinker can now see that is what the celebration was about. Fees were enough incentive to miners to secure the network without the block reward. Especially if you read the tweet it comes from, you can clearly see that is the case. 

However, that did not stop certain entities from taking the opportunity to run highly effective propaganda. 

The celebration was not ""yes, fees are very high!"", the celebration was ""yes, fees are providing enough incentive to miners to secure the network without the block reward""",1526744026

I think the better criticisms lie with the actual approach and (nonexistant) roadmap. The refusal to hardfork (as has been proven to be completely fucking safe by several other coins at the time) to a larger blocksize (even after many Core developers previously stating and even having such a proposal in the roadmap) produced a contentious hardfork that resulted in two coins (which was the boogeyman bullshit that was used as an excuse of not increasing the base block limit) which has hurt bitcoin overall.

The kicking the can down the road approach is perfectly valid when your 2nd layer is still not yet ready for mainstream use. There is now less utilization of the base layer than before but still extremely fucking terrible user experience with mempool spikes and resultant fees.

No you didn't you were just reading echo chambers infested with clueless people such as this subreddit and crypto telegrams.

&gt;I have really lost my enthusiasm because no matter how good the coin, it's tied to BTC price and will continue to go down with a decline in BTC prices.

This is stupid though, altcoins do not lose value because bitcoin is tanking. If they had any justifyable dollar value, they would keep their dollar value appreciating against bitcoin. They tank with bitcoin because money is moving out of the market as a whole. Ethereum has fiat trading pairs and it still tanks with bitcoin.

&gt;I am just waiting to first get even

Being breakeven or gambling with your profits are just fallacies, if you think crypto will appreciate you hold, if you don't you sell. Your entry point is absolutely irrelevant.

Do yourself a favor and don't invest your own money ever. Do something you understand.

(3) Most Bitcoin wallets WON'T have billions of $$$ worth, so there won't be enough value in the wallet to be worth the cost of an enormous amount of computation power on a QC for a long amount of time required in order to break their key --- Each wallet is a DIFFERENT keypair,   so cracking one wallet or another does not actually break the entire network ---- just the one wallet you managed to crack.

(4)  Quantum Computing is not as big a vulnerability for BTC users -- Most wallets COULD NOT be attacked even by a  Million-Qbit Quantum Computer that could instantly break any keypair ----- knowing the wallet address is Not enough;  that wallet ALSO has to have signed a spend transaction,  revealing the public key that goes with that wallet in the process;  MANY wallets are only used Once and then emptied,  which actually provides one of the strongest possible protection against Quantum Computer Attacks on Symmetric Crypto:   Even the PUBLIC key is kept secret/not revealed to the Bitcoin network  until the wallet makes at least one outgoing transaction ---  MANY of the wallet addresses that contain coins have only  ever  RECEIVED Bitcoins and never spent any  - which means the world knows what the HASH of the Public key is,  but only the owner or person with the wallet seed knows the exact public key.   Quantum Computing  ONLY has an advantage trying to guess the Secret key  when you know the Public Key --- Quantum Computing DOES NOT allow you to effectively figure out a working keypair that  has a certain Bitcoin address,  unless you already know what that public key is:  You would be sadly out of luck,  even with an amazingly large Quantum Computer.

(5) Stealing money from wallets on the Blockchain would reveal that the cryptography has been broken which would reduce the value of  what the CIA developed  -----  The CIA is  MORE likely to use their lab to break asymmetric crypto AND  use the discovery only in their mission of intelligence gathering --  If they develop this capability early,  then it's sure to become a heavily-guarded secret,  and they wouldn't dare  using the capability in a way that risks revealing its existence to their adversaries ----  something so frivolous as stealing Bitcoins  would be just such a frivolous activity.

(6) Even with a non-commercially available quantum computer ---  using that compute power to crack keys not securing interesting communications would be a waste of that QP time which would instead be directed towards things like decrypting  PGP traffic.   Whatever QP is built in a lab  would be very expensive to build, and limited in number,   so naturally every second of time on the QP would need to get justified  --- especially after a lot of high-value jobs come in like breaking the keypairs securing other governments' communications.

"Yes they want to change it into a democratic node voting system instead of a POW system, nChain's paper has a great break down: https://nchain.com/en/blog/proof-work-relates-theory-firm/

&gt; One of the little-known aspects of bitcoin is the nature of the proof of work system. There are many 
people, especially those who support a UASF or PoW change that believe a distributed system should 
be completed as a mesh. In this, they confuse centralised systems with centrality. The truth of the matter, 
no matter which proof of work system is implemented, they all follow a maximal growth curve that 
reflects the nature of the firm as detailed in 1937 by Ronald Coase (1937).  

&gt; The bitcoin White Paper was very specific. users of the system ""vote with their CPU power"" [1]. What 
this means, is that the system was never generated to give one vote per person. It is designed purely 
around economic incentives individuals with more hash power will have provided more investment into 
the system. These individuals who invest more in the system gain more say in the system. At the same 
time, no one or even two individuals can gain complete control of the system. We'll explore the nature 
of cartels in a separately, but these always fail without government intervention. The reason for cartels 
failing comes down to the simple incentivisation of the most efficient member. The strongest cartel 
member always ends up propping up the weakest. This leads to a strategy of defection. 

&gt; No proof of work-based solution ever allows for a scenario where you have one vote to one person. The 
anti-sybiling  functions  of bitcoin  and all  other  related  systems  based  on  proof  of  work or  similar 
derivatives are derived from an investment based strategy. Solutions to the implementation of ASIC 
based systems are constantly proposed as a methodology of limiting the centralisation of proof of work 
systems as it is termed. The truth of the matter is that the mining function within any proof of work 
system naturally aligns to business interests. This leads to corporations running machines within data 
centres. On the way that democracies and republics have migrated away from small groups of people 
individually voting for an outcome towards a vote for a party, the transactional costs associated with 
individual choice naturally leads to corporate solutions. In this, the corporation mirrors a political party. 

&gt; In this paper, we address the issues of using alternate approval work systems with regards to either 
incorporating alternate functions in an extension of simply securing the network against the use of proof 
of work systems to create a one person one vote scenario in place of economic incentivisation. We will 
demonstrate conclusively that all systems migrate to a state of economic efficiency. The consequence 
of this is that systems form into groups designed to maximise returns. The effect is that bitcoin is not 
only incentive compatible but is optimal. No system can efficiently collapse into an order of one vote 
one individual and remain secure. In the firm-based nature of bitcoin, we demonstrate that the inherent 
nature of the firm is reflected within mining pools. Multiple aggregation strategies exist. The strategies 
range from the creation of collective firms where members can easily join or leave (mining pools) 
through to more standard corporate structures",1526741099

You completely missunderstand the threat we talk about. Completely! Sorry.

Someone has already upvoted your nonsense, so education is needed, so let me explain (please read up to the end):

&gt;Here is the reality. This quantum computing attack is no more of a danger than a nuclear attack on the network.

irrelevant rhetoric - ignored.

&gt; Think about this. How much would it cost to build and deploy this on bitcoin. It would cost enormous amounts beyond what IBM has.

pure speculation, and ibm is not the likely attacker. hence irrelevant rhetoric - ignored.

&gt; They maybe able to attack the network in some local locations but not the whole network.

If an attacker cracks a secret key locally and then spends the associated coins on the bitcoin network via broadcast, it has global implications on the *whole* network. So your differentiation betw. local and global (""whole"") makes absolutely no sense at all.

&gt;And breaking the encryption of the network will only allow them to double spend their coins every 10 minutes.

No! This is not the attack we talk about. Quantum computers would crack elliptic curve cryptography, not sha256.  So double spending is not the threat"" Stealing foreign coins is the treat we talk about!

&gt; And seeing this may persist for a few blocks the nodes can identify the attack and reject those blocks. The quantum attack is no greater of an attack than a 51% attack.  

As said, you are completely wrong. Quantum computers cannot 51% attack the network, because they cannot attack sha256, so they cannot mine blocks any faster. (And if they could, the 51% attack would be a major, not minor threat).

Instead, quantum computers can find the secret keys from public keys, thus allowing them to spend bitcoins from addresses that have been spent from already (because spending discloses the input addresse's public key).",1526739439

This is not true, or at least not entirely true. If by commerce you're referring to buying coffee and paying for Steam games, then yes, you're correct, some txs are being priced out. But there's more than that to Bitcoin, and there's healthy economic activity with going on.

&gt;we can sit back and trust that this scheme you're talking about will work

That's exactly what we should do, sit back and relax whilst the network is being built. Test it out here and there, to find bugs and help with the building, but mainly just enjoy the ride.

There's plenty of chains that ""just work"" in the exact same way, from Litecoin to DOGE and Monero. And if you really want to stick to a bitcoin fork, you can just as well use BTG or bitcoin private, alongside BCH. And yes, all these chains are actually relieving pressure from Bitcoin, which is dearly needed whilst the network is being built.

Ironically, the worst possible way to *hurt* Bitcoin right now is to encourage its use, since the network is not ready to sustain huge amounts of txs. But, of course, fees would rise and create a natural barrier to entry, and so relieve pressure... I love the fee market, natural economic self-regulation!!!

And you assumed they create usdt when someone deposits actual usd which I find really difficult to believe. I believe they are inflating the total market cap by printing it out of thin air and giving it out for cryptos like BTC. As long as the crypto values are going up great for everyone. If prices go down and people start converting usdt to usd we are all fucked if they don't have the deposits for the same amount. No liquidity and everything implodes. Nuclear winter for cryptos and idiots will be talking about how they knew bitcoin was a ponzi for years.,1526739035
"Quantum computing is no threat to Bitcoin, that has been debunked many times. When they become available (in a few decades) open source bitcoin will have adjusted its protocol long in advance. Bitcoin is antifragile, the more is attacked, the stronger it gets. And when the age comes where quantum computers ARE a threat, both the bad guys and the good guys, and the average citizen, will have them. It'll be much like it is now. Most progress made in the hardware industry is pretty linear. Worrying about quantum computers right now is certainly a waste of energy, given that quantum computers are still in their infantile stages, and can only operate at absolute zero temperatures. (Hint: It's an extremely difficult job to find a way to bring absolute zero cooling methods to the consumer market.). While ECDSA is indeed not secure under quantum computing, quantum computers don't yet exist and probably won't for a while. The DWAVE system often written about in the press is, even if all their claims are true, not a quantum computer of a kind that could be used for cryptography.
Bitcoin's security, when used properly with a new address on each transaction, depends on more than just ECDSA: Cryptographic hashes are much stronger than ECDSA under QC. Bitcoin's security was designed to be upgraded in a forward compatible way and could be upgraded if this were considered an imminent threat.
See the implications of quantum computers on public key cryptography here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computer#Potential

"Yeah, I don't think there are any situations in life where when receiving a couple of millions of dollars in bitcoin, you can't wait a couple of hours.

The use case for instant zero conf million dollar transactions is quite low, if you ask me. 

The higher the value of a tx the more sense it makes to want more  confirmations. If you do it wrong and you get scammed you will learn quickly and do it right.

That being said even if you do it wrong, it's very hard for attackers to actually attack in this way and make a profit. 

So it's all good. It's not about 100% security. That does not even exist. Even a million confirmations will not save luke-jr from the wrath of God.

Meanwhile all these people are trying to build an ecosystem. Miners take huge risk by investing all this money. Some smart Chinese people see a huge opportunity and start bitmain.

Who took the risks? Not the core devs. Their whole demeanour was basically: this is an experiment for nerds, we don't even want success. Oh and also, Bitcoin can't really work.

Then Bitcoin did get successful. Which pissed them off even more because it hurt their fragile egos. 

So what do they do, these sour people that missed their own boat? Well, they decided to do their best to ruin it for everybody else.

"&gt; Two separate claims here. Regarding DDOS and other technical attacks...I'm pretty sure that any Bitcoin client that is vulnerable will suffer these attacks. You think core is vulnerable but everyone is too nice to attack it? Of course not. It hasn't fallen to such attacks because it is sufficiently secure.

The fuck? Do you even know how DDoS works? It has nothing to do with the client software's security. It's just bringing down people's internet connections, and sometimes, entire local ISPs. Search the /r/bitcoin history from that time in 2015. You'll see exactly what I'm talking about.

&gt; As for the social media claim...this sort of assumes that BCH and the alternatives to the core client are actually a big secret. Everyone in the space knows about BCH, every Bitcoiner on reddit knows about r/btc, and bitcoimdotcom isnt exactly hidden. People are very aware.

So all these accounts that spout a pro-BCH position on Twitter aren't getting mass reported? So the stealing of a mod account and vandalism of /r/btc didn't happen? So the stealing of thousands of dollars of BCH from /u/tippr didn't happen? So the bots that post 'BCASH LOL' on every pro BCH youtuber's videos aren't real?

That's one big rock you're living under.

&gt; You could ask the same question about ciphrex or chaincode labs or bitstamp or bitthumb or dozens of other companies. Do they all simultaneously completely control BTC?

If you have the power to say what does and doesn't get put into the reference client, then yes, you have control. That's literally what control is. Why is this so hard for you to grasp?

&gt; I could ask the same question about Bitmain and BCH. Would that mean Bitmain controls BCH? I'm guessing you'd say no.

As a miner and funder of development teams, yes, Bitmain has some level of control over BCH. But it's only partial. Plus, as a miner, the success of the coin is intimately tied to the success of their business - they have a lot of skin in the game. That's how Satoshi wanted it to be.",1526737714

"First a comment about about ""Core"" and ""centralization of development"". Core is not a static, entrenched group of people but a very dynamic one. Jimmy Song is training more and more devs, in bunches of ~25, and they will most likely end up joining Core. You'll have to prove your technical competence before anyone pays serious attention to your proposals to change the base protocol, but that is only normal - You don't want a random, sub-par coder to start messing with the protocol. 

Point is, ""Core devs"" is a very loosely defined term - Anybody could be a Core dev, if they start contributing to the Core client. 

&amp;nbsp;

Whilst technically true that 

&gt;The Core dev group quite literally controls the BTC protocol now 

that must not be mistaken to mean that they

&gt;can do with it anything they want. And they've been doing so.

The former is true because, by definition, *someone* from Core controls the Github commits, and thus also the commits that would change the Bitcoin protocol. But that doesn't imply the latter. And the reason for that is that no one can force node operators to run software they don't agree with.

For example - Let's say that Core tomorrow decided to decrease the block capacity, from 4MBW to 2MBW. Can they publish the code into the Github? Yes. But no one can force me or the other full nodes to use it. The code is dead in the water. 

Or consider the reverse: Let's say you really dislike the devs who currently control the commits and convince Github to remove their commit rights. The new group of people in charge of the Github ""bitcoin-core"", let's call them ""CoreS2X"", now push a block capacity increase, from 4MBW to 8MBW. Now what? Just like before, no one can force me to run that code, so the code is again dead in the water. 

And whilst the drama of changed protocols unfolds, I'm happily sitting on my current node doing its thing, which is enforcing the current consensus rules, that I agree with. Network unchanged.

If I continue with this, I would expect the code to be forked away and development would continue of a different repo where the devs, ""NewCore"", would work on proposals that reflect the community desires better. 

The conclusion is that Core do ""control"" the Bitcoin protocol, but cannot change it as they wish... because the network of full nodes is decentralized. The only protocol changes will happen if **everyone** agrees to it, or the vast majority anyway. That is, if there is consensus.


&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Their stated aim, via Blockstream, is to figure out how to make profits with off-chain transactions.

&gt;Why do BTC supporters ignore development centralization? Why aren't they concerned by one corporation completely controlling BTC development.


One, [Blockstream =/= Core](https://medium.com/@whalecalls/fud-or-fact-blockstream-inc-is-the-main-force-behind-bitcoin-and-taken-over-160aed93c003)

Two, even if Blockstream really did control the entire development, as explained above, no one could force me to run software I don't agree with.

Three, Blockstream is aiming to make money with off-chain solutions, that's true and they are extremely open about it. Is that conflict of interest? You could say so. But let's look at a different industry... say energy. Solar panel producers are most definitely lobbying against the fossil fuel industry. Or lobbying for a stronger push of renewable energy. Conflict of interest? Just the same. What about the fossil fuel industry? What are they lobbying for? Again a conflict of interest. 

So what should we do? What should **I** do? Well, I'll make my own decision and heat my home exactly the way I want it... which happens to be with solar panels because that reflects **my** view on energy efficiency. Do I care that solar panel producers make money? Not at all, it allows me to express my view on the environment and climate change. You don't agree with me? You'll burn gas. My choice makes money for solar producers, your choice makes money for gas producers.

Back to Blockstream. Whenever there's a conflict of opinions someone is set to lose and someone is set to win. I, personally, want Bitcoin to have small blocks. (Not discussing the reasons at this time.) I run software that enforces my view, i.e. ""small block consensus rules"", and don't care if Blockstream makes money as a result of my views. Especially since I know that no matter what my view is, **someone** will be making money off it. If they are called Blockstream, bitcoin(dot)com, BitMain or nChain, **someone** will be making money off my views. It might as well be Blockstream.

So explain how its more egalitarian to give people 10,000x more bitcoin per block in the first 4 years of bitcoin than in the later years?

How is it more fair for someone to have 10,000x less opportunity to get bitcoin because they were born later?

How is it less egalitarian if everyone just gets the same amount of bitcoin per block?

Or if you can't answer any of those basic questions, at least answer how you think its egalitarian to have exponentially decreasing mining rewards only for 120 years and then none after that. What about only being allowed to mine exponentially decreasing amounts of bitcoin for 140 years is the most egalitarian distribution possible?",1526735335

This site gives a nice update from lightning Network.

Number of open Mainnet Nodes: 2411.
Total of open Channels: 8912.
Total channel Capacity : BTC 21.78848171.

In my Opinion, the total number of open Mainnet Nodes is not so important, you need nodes with open channels.
. 

You have 609 nodes with 0 channels.
That makes than 2411 - 609= 1 802 Nodes.

The 8912 Channels are all channels what you can use for routing. For example, an Eclair channel from the app to a Node is not in this list.

Second important part, is the routing. In how many hops can you reach the complete network. At this time, for some nodes, you need Maximum 6 Hops for reach all the nodes. But most of the nodes do it in 4 hops, where 5 and 6 are an exception.

"&gt; When tether inflates we know USD has been committed for the long run
&gt;&gt; You don't know that

Yes we do know that, maybe the USDT just sits in the users account forever. However from tether expanding we KNOW USD has been committed to crypto until tether deflates.

&gt; You only know that tether was exchanged for something else. They made tether and then traded it for something. That's all you know for sure

Irrelevant when the USD in tether remained constant, doesn't matter if someone gets ETH for 1USDT or 1000USDT because that USD will still remain in crypto until USDT deflates.

&gt; You can't say its zero sum

It's zero sum just like accounting or even the expansion of the universe. Expand Tether then the whole market inflates, contract tether and the whole market shrinks. you can plot this vs the marketcap.

"That appears to be the case.

I don't understand how so much money is flowing into these destined to fail projects. None of these tokens build off the decentralized revolution that Bitcoin kicked off. They are a way for companies to raise money without going through normal securities regulations.

Attempts to create alternative currencies and unlicensed securities sales have been happening for decades and until Bitcoin all have been shut down and destroyed by governments. The only reason Bitcoin has not been shut down is because it cannot be shut down. It can be stifled but not destroyed. Governments look weak when they pass laws that cannot be enforced; so they have not gone after Bitcoin.

Confused and Naive spectators do not know the history of attempts at private, non-state controlled currencies. They see that Bitcoin is allowed to flourish and mistakenly believe that all ""Crypto"" is created equal in technical merit and in the eyes of regulators.

Surely if you don't need the protections (and inefficiency) of decentralization if the State is friendly towards your project ; so I can understand why some of these naive investors feel that centrally controlled projects are technologically ""superior"" to Bitcoin.

However these people either do not understand the history of attempts at private, non-government issued money, or they are making a very high stakes bet that all governments of the world will be friendly towards these centralized projects.

See that is a major difference between decentralized and centralized.

With a truly decentralized project like Bitcoin, it would take the coordinated effort of all governments in the world to shut it down.

With centralized projects it requires that every government in the world consents to giving up some of their power to the CEO's of these projects. 

Centralized projects have leaders who can be corrupted or killed.

Centralized projects have central points of failure and can not effectively resist government intervention.

How many coins/projects would absolutely die if a government decided to arrest the project coordinators? How many coins/projects would survive an attack on their network infrastructure?

Governments will almost certainly crack down on ICO's.

Why should any company go through the expensive and laborious process of complying with SEC and other regulations to sell stock if they can freely raise money with token sales?

ICO's are a direct threat to the stock market. Companies will transition to ICO's over stocks. They'll offer a trade in; and allow shareholders to trade their shares for an equal stake in tokens.

Then once there are no more shareholders, companies will not be obligated or controlled by ""shareholder"" but by general sentiment of tokenholders. No need to worry about SEC or other regulations. Need more money, just issue more tokens.

Why would any company bother with stocks and the SEC if they could get access to the same capital but without regulations?

Its always possible that governing bodies make game-changing decisions like to allow ICO's to continue unfettered ; but in my opinion it is just a matter of time until ICO's are highly regulated. When this happens the whole market will probably take a sharp dive until people understand there is a difference between ICO's and Bitcoin.",1526734742

"This is better then just burning 15% of the fees. 

And also it needs to be something that miners do voluntarily, not forced and not something we would build in to the protocol. 

If we organize as a community, and can create very favourable jobs for devs that will attract devs to our project. 

For instance I know that there are only a handful of people behind BitcoinABC and they can use more funding. 

Miners make a lot of money, and they earned it by talking risks and investing lots of money. But it's in their long term interest that the community has the best devs. 

That being said we don't want devs to be 100% dependable on miners. That's a conflict of intrest. If miners want to pay their share and help the fans and users, that's  great. But devs need to be free and not bound to the preferences of only the miners. 

We need a funding model with a healthy balance between users and miners. 

There does not need to be a power struggle when devs, users and miners all work towards the same goal: turning Bitcoin Cash in to the  first global currency. The standard on the internet for payments. 

Everybody benefits when this happens. And it's the only way to create long term sustainability. When the block reward is gone and the network is not being used globally it won't survive any more because the incentives to run the network will be gone. ",1526734563

"It matters not a jot if Maxwell or other conspirators have slunk off into the sunset with their payouts and left Blockstream - the damage is done.

When it mattered was three years ago when BTC could have continued to scale organically as it had for the previous 5 years uneventfully. 

Since then bitcoin has forked into two versions and the Core chain whilst retaining the brand has become expensive to use and increasingly unpredictable under network load, it's utility has nosedived and now has little appeal other than an investment token. 

The phenomenon of bitcoin developmental capture has been entirely responsible for the amazing innovation and market cap increase of the alts and ultimately it's derailment will result in another cryptocurrency being the first to find mainstream adoption - should any ever achieve that goal.

There is little chance that bitcoin can perform that role at this time. 

We certainly cannot have bitcoin become a peer-to-peer decentralised cash which is borderless, censorship-resistant, accessible to the third world and cheaper than legacy banking institutions!

"It seems you have bought the lame stream media bankster narrative that bitcoin is some kind of 'digital asset' that you buy and sell like stock to increase your fiat wealth.

That narrative is simply untrue.

What scares THEM the most is that bitcoin may actually BECOME the currency that IS the final settlement layer determining the price of ALL currencies. It simply means that THEY can no longer print money out of thin air to throw fake bankster wars.

Bitcoin is leaderless and no, you do NOT NEED a third party to facilitate transactions. That is just part of the growing pains, where we are at now, with many people (but not most) using exchanges to buy bitcoin with fiat.

It is important to be able to transact without a third party so that that third party does NOT have the power to decide who may or may not engage in trade. There is a mountain of info on this everywhere. Look into it, it is the fine line between freedom and self determination and slavery.

Please please please consider this idea and learn to understand history and the true importance of this facility.

My friend, I am already an old man. By the time you crypto warriors and bitcoiners win and bitcoin IS the final settlement layer for ALL value exchange, I'll be long gone.

This really has nothing to do with me, but rather mankind's eternal struggle against the forces seeking to enslave him.
It's about all of our kids, grand kids , great grand kids etc.

As for ME, the increasingly senile old guy, I'm well ahead on any 'investment' I ever made in Bitcoin and anything over $560 is fine by me as it has already multiplied my meager 'retirement income' - that is if you could even call something so meager a retirement income.

Again, I got lucky. One of my grand daughters gifted me some bitcoin a number of years ago. 

But believe me THAT is completely irrelevant in comparison to the idea that because of bitcoin , just maybe, NONE of my descendants will have to live through as many wars as I have had to. ALL if them being fake bankster wars driving humanity further and further into ignorance, stupidity and outright slavery.

This idea keeps me alive. This community overall has more balls than anything I have seen in my lifetime.

There are if course those who are struggling with it internally because the mere existence of an option to exit the fraudulent fiat debt based system forces you to come to terms with what is real and what we've been led to believe.

We are all on this journey together. Thank you so much for humouring this old fella and engaging in proper discussion.

This stability is good for using the currency as intended. If your co\-coin\-users are also interested in high volumes and massive swings, I have bad news for your crypto. 

Your coin needs to create value by solving problems, which I have yet to see in any coin outside of Bitcoin. ",1526731802

Poe's law is an adage of Internet culture stating that, without a clear indicator of the author's intent, it is impossible to create a parody of extreme views so obviously exaggerated that it cannot be mistaken by some readers for a sincere expression of the parodied views.

The original statement of the adage, by Nathan Poe, was:

"There's a general confusion about ""banks"". Banks will do business in whatever currency is most profitable, and if that happens to be bitcoin, they will happily jump on board. They will adapt their business models, but they aren't going away, that you can be sure of. IMO, the killer feature of bitcoin is not that it will kill banks, it won't, but it will weaken the industry, which is good. At some point banks will be more like a cottage industry than a giant behemot no one can touch. And that's good for everyone.",1526731021
Hard to say who will profit most but the fact is it is here to stay. I think we are in very early adoption. I think btc is more comparable to early Christianity than the dot com bubble.

"I actually think ETH is probably the best pay right now. Huge levels of adoption, excellent utility and in my opinion and the pullback has been healthy.

Biggest drawbacks I'd say are:
-Bloated blockchain is risking decentralisation
-Development is too centralised. If Vitalik leaves the project, it's probably all over for ETH
-Solidity is a new programming language and developers have lost a lot of money from mistakes programming with it. Other coins are utilising familiar and arguably more robust languages
-EOS, NEO and even IOTA are now competing on the decentralised apps and smart contract front. Bitcoin could be competing in the not too distant future with RSK.
-Development is now quite slow on Etheriumb compared to newer projects. Proof of stake is taking a very long time to implement (whereas NEO is already using this consensus mechanism) and the Raiden network looks to be lagging a long way behind the lightning network.

All that being said, I'm still bullish on Etherium as I think it has a strong first mover advantage in the smart contract dapps space. But I do see a number of risks emerging which I'll be keeping an eye on, and potentially taking some profits off the table if ETH loses ground to some of these other projects in the near future.",1526730942

You may have companies that set up peer to peer loans, and they view the history and mark your risk accordingly.

Nobody expects you to. If 10 minutes is your content limit or whatever, then be better at deciding what videos are going to be about. Clearly you didn't talk about PoS whatsoever, why include it in the title? Unbiased? Your main point I have taken from your video is that it takes lots of energy to do PoW. That's it.

"Your Bitcoin client is talking to many nodes in the network at any given time. If one or some nodes start reporting an invalid history, your client disconnects from them. Your client then automatically searches for more nodes to connect to. In effect this means it is next to impossible to propagate bad blocks across the network, so the chances of your client actually ever seeing one are close to zero.

I just saw people making an argument ""calling BTC ""Bitcoin Core"" is the same as calling HTTP ""HTTP Chrome"" or something"". Now the same argument can be made about calling BCH ""bcash"".

I don't have an opinion about all these arguments. I call the coins ""BTC"" and ""BCH"" because nobody seems to be against these names. Meanwhile ""Bitcoin"", ""Bitcoin (BTC)"", ""Bitcoin (BCH)"", ""Bitcoin Core"", ""Bitcoin Cash"", ""bcash"" and probably other names are not neutral.

"&gt;First is ""The Core dev group"".  This makes it sound as though all core contributors are a monolith

All contributes that affect the governance are pushed by a monolithic group, the ""dozens of other coders"" are only allowed to push stuff irrelevant to the governance. That's because that small monolithic group has veto power over anything that gets on github. Also ""implemented Segwit"" and ""corrected a variable's name"" are two commits with a very different importance.

&gt;  ""we're going to hardfork so that 10&amp;#37; of all miners' fees go to our own  development fund"", do you think anyone would still run their code? 

Yes they will, of course they will, the last years clearly demonstrated that they will. In this phase of pure speculative bubble for crypto, what matters to investors is the ""Bitcoin"" brand; they dont't care what ""Bitcoin"" is, at all, they only care about the price. Proofs:

* Core decided that they didn't want smart contract and other useful use cases. Investors didn't care.
* Core decided to keep 1Mb blocksize for no logical reason. Investors didn't care.
* Core changed the original project and goals that made Bitcoin great. Investors didn't care.
* In December it has been obvious how Core's decision crippled Bitcoin and made it unusable as P2P electronic cash. Investors didn't care.
* Now Core released banking 2.0, but investors still don't care.

&gt; The only reason that core remains the reference client is because people overwhelmingly choose to use it, of their own volition 

Obviously not of their own volition. It's because Core forced them to, by destoying any other alternative client using censorship, astroturfing and social engineering attacks to rebrand them as ""malicious"", ""not Bitcoin"" and ""frauds"". Investors concerned only about the brand did the rest. There's no ""volition"" when there's only one choice.

"There's a good chance we'll be paying with some form of crypto in 10 years' time, but it won't be BTC. It's slow, expensive \(blocks are still 1 MB and the only reason the mempool is clear is that people stopped transacting\), relies on an overly complex second layer solution to scale, and still has the terrible PoW that's using more power than a small country and is on course to negate all recent advancements in green energy.

At best, Ethereum or some other semi\-known coin moves faster and implements the necessary scaling and PoS.

At worst, none of the coins find any kind of mainstream success as BTC is yesterday's coin and preferences are split among the million other 2nd and 3rd gen coins in circulation, holding up adoption for all of them while banks and tech unicorns continue work on their own digital currencies \(not necessarily ""crypto""\). The day you can pay for your groceries with Amazoncoin is a lot closer than the day you can do it with BTC.

China pays for everything with Alipay, which is already ""money in an app"", it's just tied to the user's bank account in yuan. Once the Chinese government decides to push its own centrally controlled crypto, that's it, mainstream adoption of crypto is achieved.

In the West, Facebook or Amazon may skip the government step and just add a feature to buy, trade and pay with their own credits. That wouldn't be proper crypto either but convenience always wins and people will convert their money into credits at a staggering rate with a giant smile on their woolly face. ""Money in an app"" is all anyone needs, after all.

And as our new global digital currency of the future turns out to be Facebookcoin, the only remaining use case for crypto will be the dark net.

I don't support BCH, but still, thanks very much for setting crypto back two years while showing your hand to people with a thousand times the resources and an incentive to beat your ass, Blockstream.",1526726233

"Whitepaper gives a  17.73523&amp;#37; probability with 30&amp;#37; hash and 5 confirmations, so sounds about right.

**HOWEVER**, his statement is still completely misleading because:

* nobody owns 30&amp;#37; hashpower and ""mining centralization"" is all in his head.
* 13&amp;#37; chance it's still so damn good. It means that the miner, despite throwing away the equivalent of 2 whole block rewards, has a 87&amp;#37; chance of failing. For comparison, today that's 200k USD down the drain for every attempt.
* if someone needs to transact some millions USD, he can fix this by simply requiring more confirmations. This exponentially increases the miner's chance of failing.
* 30&amp;#37; hashpower that switches to mine an orphaned chain will suddenly slow down the main chain and *everyone* will notice that an attack is going on, thus requiring more confirmations.
* The two ""fixes"" above can be implemented by any wallet \(also SPV\), in the form of ""calculate the optimal confirmations considering X USD amount being sent"" and ""increase number of confirmations required if the block time gets suspiciously higher after the transaction is sent""
* \(this is also the conclusion to every ""attack"" that i've read as an argument from this clown\) an successful attack like this will cause a loss in the millions USD that'll get all over the news, thus destroying the confidence in Bitcoin's security and, of course, price and miner's long term profitability. Thus no miner will ever attempt it, and this is a pure theoretical scenario.

bonus for teh lulz 1: this is only valid now. Given that BTC has commited to small blocks and 2nd layers that steal miner's fees, as the coinbase reward halves, the attack becomes more profitable on BTC. Basically, they broke the incentives in Satoshi's original project and apparently luke &amp; co don't even understand Bitcoin's security.

"My crazy belief is that incredibly wealthy people are manipulating many crypto's prices all at once and they can set prices and make the bubbling up happen when they are ready. That said, I think fundamentals, adoption, real-world-use and the dev. community will matter to the price in the long run. I think some (few) coins will become dominant in their use cases. I don't see how miners mining mostly whatever coins are most valued (in fiat) will push the crypto space into the abyss. Miners mostly FOLLOW current coin values to max their profits. I don't think they make the coin values move up and down.

I don't think mining income is crucial to his overall income. Jihan is investing, HODLing, working on manufacturing Crypto Miners and chips for A.I. uses now. I don't think he is ignoring the long term sustainability of his business future. Maybe I did not understand your point about that.

"You are correct. They are doing it slowly, but what I stated is a possibility because of the high chance of success if they want to go all out guns blazing. Jihan himself admit, they are mining BTC to get money, which is very logical since it is at 9k, highest of all coins available.

But do you know, by selling the current available BTC they mine to buy up BCH, they are reducing the available supply of BCH at a ratio of 10:1?

Now that BTC has been bought up by the market while they take cheap BCH from newbs at a ratio of 10:1, there is 10 times lesser BCH compared to BTC in the market. When the flippening comes and they dump BTC, BTC price cannot recover due to the fact that it is 10x easier to pump a $1000 coin then to buy up the supply of a 10k coin. What do you think happens when BTC gets swapped en masse at exchanges? Winklevoss going to buy up 100k more BTC on top of their current holding as the price tanks? JP Morgan pumping in 1 billion USD to save a BTC dumping from going down? No, you get the entire market rushing in to buy BCH as we seen last year during the bull run. You see exchange bots automatically triggered to buy BCH and sell BTC as profitability logic kicks in. Problem is, most BCH has been bought up in the past 5 years. There just isn't enough supply to get BCH. Whales who trade 1000 BCH in exchange? Easily bought up with only 100 BTC.

That said, I feel poor haha, I barely have much BCH myself as I don't earn that much, but whatever may happen in the future, I'm sure people will look back and see how we, the underdogs have fought the good fight ;)",1526724972

In regards to Vitalik. This may be of shock to you but Vitalik was a known scammer before he attempted and succeded at the premine unregulated security scam within the Bitcoin community. He scammed a bunch of  investors into a quantum mining scam.

He also wanted Bitcoin to obviously become what Ethereum is now which is totally ambiguous and a kind of science project where if it goes wrong it doesn't matter because we can just reverse the blockchain and bail everyone out \(as it happened\). The consensus within the Bitcoin community has always been a hypersecurity approach. It's kind of the total opposite of the ambiguity within the Ethereum ecosystem. As an example just ask an Ethereum developer what the maximum supply of Ether is and they give you an answer like ""this is an area of active research"" or something like that.  They don't know if they are a currency unless they are pushing the flippening narrative, when the 3 letter people come knocking they are apparently just gas for contracts, they were supposed to be a ""world replicated virtual computer"" and now they are on the verge of sharding. It's all over the place. There is more to it but you get my drift right ? 

There is consensus within development just as any other area and there is no reason that the entire Ethereum platform cannot be run on a sidechain with the underlying asset as the 21 million Bitcoin that will exist as opposed to the hyperinflating premined Ether and this is with 10x cheaper gas cost and much more efficient contract execution, if you haven't clicked, I've just described RSK.

"Sorry don’t mean to sound harsh but if you’re trading based on Reddit as market indicator you’re not going to do well. The price inevitably will go back up on its own because it’s scarce. You are buying a ticket on the roller coaster. If you want to get off, fine. After enough people get off the ride continues. If 95% of ppl get off, it will still continue because those 5 % have payed and will still ride. Same goes for mining. Difficulty drops and more people get back on. BTC is the first and best proven method of an emergent technology and can’t be killed or go away no matter the opinion on reddit or anywhere else for that matter. I’m from Canada and am in Berlin having this debate with some guys from Russia. They are also trying to convince their friends how incredible this NEW tech is. The point is people are aware of it all over the globe, and yes institutional money is already in it and heavily manipulating the price and will continue to as long as it makes them money.  But consider this: BTC is literally as indestructible as the internet. It could be argued it’s as indestructible as DNA. You can bash it, suppress it, manipulate it, compete with it, copy it, call it rat poison, send 1000000 to a burn address (please do, make it even MORE valuable), chew it up and spit it out, but you cannot destroy it. There will always be a global hardcore group of users that will use it even if it goes back to $100. I kind of hope it does so all the weak whiny non-contributing “traders” and non-hodlers can exit the market and then guess what? Bitcoin will do the same thing any useful, valuable and scarce resource will do. Go up. And if you’re smart you get as much of that shit as you can afford and if it goes to $100 you make sure you put your private keys in your will and hand that shit down to your descendants because BITCOIN IS HERE ...TO ....STAY.

1.) NONE of these attacks actually ever happened on Bitcoin in 9 years. guess why. Those are all theories and remain theories until PROVEN to work in reality. nobody ever proved it.    
2.) Keep in mind - Bitcoin mining is multi million, even a billion dollar industry for some of the participating miners. Mining works, because the incentives work correctly.    
If any Mining Pool (and you need a mining pool for such an attack, you could impossibly manage to aquire that much hash power alone) would perform such an attack,this mining pool would be done.    
They would be rejected from the community. They would be sued from all sides, get into legal trouble.    
Maybe you can perform such an attack once. But not twice.    
and the incentives for honest mining vastly outreach such behaviour in the long run.

"Obviously the difference can't fit into your lamestream programmed brain.

I'll try again.

Hoarding is when you hoard something that you personally value for whatever reason, thinking it will make or keep you rich later on.

HODLing is holding onto Bitcoin specifically because you can see the potential for bitcoin to completely rewrite what we call money and become the final settlement layer for ALL value BECAUSE it is the first leaderless money we have ever had.

If someone is holding bitcoin to get rich, you are correct, that person is also hoarding.

But HODLers hold on so that the incumbent scum can't buy it with their self created fake fiat and screw up that possibility of a thousand years of world peace by selling each other out again and just turn bitcoin into some kind of 'digital asset'.

The HODL is extremely important. 

Bitcoin is spreading out into the hands of normal people world wide through HODLers, while the incumbent fiat hoarders are freaking out.

It seems you may be one of the latter.

"&gt; No, it's dominant because competing clients that did exactly as you suggest were DDoS'd, banned from major forums, attacked relentlessly on social media, and the authors of which were slandered, bullied, and threatened. Look at what happened with XT. It's clear that people are NOT free to fork the codebase.

Incompatible competing clients maybe. You are free to discuss and run bitcoin knots on one of the ""censored"" forums. You are free to fork bitcoin and call it dogecoin or litecoin. You are, understandably, not free to fork bitcoin, attempt change the consensus rules, and pretend it's bitcoin. Just like i'm not free to fork bitcoinABC, merge segwit and reduce the blocksize, and then call it bitcoin cash without getting agreement from the community first.

&gt; Show me one significant change to Bitcoin that Blockstream was not in favor of that got approved and put into the codebase.

Why do you suddenly switch the conversation to blockstream? Blocksteam does not support of reject changes. Individual developers of blockstream, part of the bitcoin core team, do. There have been plenty of changes suggested by blockstream developers that where rejected by the core developers. Just look to lukt-jr's crazy BIP's. 

Show me one significant change to bitcoinABC that nChain was not in favor of. Wait. Why? That doesn't make any sense. What does that prove? Nothing.

&gt; Again, you're ignoring history. Core is the reference client because any alternatives that seek to undermine that position are attacked relentlessly, barred from all communication channels, and illegally cyberattacked to kick them off the network. Core literally attacked valid Bitcoin nodes for daring to run an alternative client that was outside their control.

Is bitcoin knots rentlessly attacked? No. Is bitcore rentlessly attacked? No. btcd then? No. Alternatives to bitcoin core are never attacked. Alternatives that seek to change the consensus rules without consensus are attacked. And not by core, by the community. This is a discussion about developers, not about the community.

Please show proof that ""Core literally attacked valid Bitcoin nodes"". By the way, I would be honored if people spent time to attack my software. If my software can't handle that, then it's clear that I'm at fault. I should give them a bug bounty.

&gt; Nobody gives a shit about people who contribute some typo fixes in readmes. Core is controlled by Blockstream. No proposals disliked by Blockstream are able to make their way into Core. That's proof enough.

I'm sorry to disappoint but that logic doesn't make any sense. With your standards of ""proof"" I can prove anything. No proposals disliked by bitmain make their way into bitcoinABC. Therefore bitcoinABC is controlled by bitmain.

Come on, I'm replying honestly and politely, there's no need to throw insults at me just because you disagree. We can communicate better than that.

&gt; No, it's dominant because competing clients that did exactly as you suggest were DDoS'd, banned from major forums, attacked relentlessly on social media, and the authors of which were slandered, bullied, and threatened. Look at what happened with XT. It's clear that people are NOT free to fork the codebase.

Two separate claims here. Regarding DDOS and other technical attacks...I'm pretty sure that any Bitcoin client that is vulnerable will suffer these attacks. You think core is vulnerable but everyone is too nice to attack it? Of course not. It hasn't fallen to such attacks because it is sufficiently secure.

As for the social media claim...this sort of assumes that BCH and the alternatives to the core client are actually a big secret. Everyone in the space knows about BCH, every Bitcoiner on reddit knows about r/btc, and bitcoimdotcom isnt exactly hidden.  People are very aware.

&gt; Nobody gives a shit about people who contribute some typo fixes in readmes. Core is controlled by Blockstream. No proposals disliked by Blockstream are able to make their way into Core. That's proof enough.

How is that proof enough?

You could ask the same question about ciphrex or chaincode labs or bitstamp or bitthumb or dozens of other companies.  Do they all simultaneously completely control BTC?

I could ask the same question about Bitmain and BCH. Would that mean Bitmain controls BCH?  I'm guessing you'd say no.

"Concise explanation of how it might happen, by /u/markpsp:

&gt;its simple, instead of dumping it for cash, he can transfer all the BTC to multiple exchanges, swap them at BCH/BTC, crash BTC price while increasing BCH price. This way, there won't be a market crash, instead, only BTC crashes while BCH goes inversely up, riding on the ratio change.

&gt;Based on the amount that Jihan and Roger has, the amount they both hold should be sufficient to crash the entire BTC and suck dry BCH supply in exchanges around the world. The market will not be able to absorb that many BTC at the price of 9k, but with 10:1 ratio, BCH supply will dry up quickly, leading to a flippening. This is compounded by the fact that BTC will not be able to recover hashrate when BCH immediately pumps up. with 50:50 miners mining at the BCH pump, BTC transactions will open the floodgate at 1MB and all hell will break loose. We will see 300MB mempool once again where people are bailing out, running to exchanges to sell off before it goes to 0. Not even lightening can save them, remember, lightening is only a tab recording system that shows you how much you owe or how much you are owed. You need to close channels in order for btc to be transacted on chain and finalized. With 300mb, your channel will take forever to close.

&gt;Now you ask, why 5 years? Well, the purpose bitcoin exist was to flip the banks, create a true peer-to-peer currency without intermediary. Once the banks come in, hold on to useless btc shit, thats where you want to flip it. Dont flip when they have 0.01% stake in BTC, you maximize damage by crashing it when they hold 10 - 15% in BTC. Then proceed to throw all your hashrate behind the newly pumped BCH. Other miners will follow soon, this is the economic incentive that was designed by Satoshi in Bitcoin's whitepaper. This is how you maximize damage, this is how you use human greed against greedy centralize bankers and blockstream scammers, this is how you educate greedy BTC core shills and BTC trolls.",1526721478

Like they have been for months, I think the manipulators will probably make the value-flippening a slow process so that the overall marketplace will do fine.

"&gt; It only works and is only necessary as a part of Bitcoin

Completely false. A blockchain solves the double spending problem and the Byzantine Generals’ Problem, both of which were previously unsolved theoretical problems. It is also incredibly ignorant to isolate a new emerging technology to one specific use case, eg: Bitcoin. Although bitcoin is a great example of a practical use case for a blockchain, it highly unlikely to be the only one. There are already other practical ones being used (eg: Ethereum).

Another example of this is the laser. When lasers were first invented they had no practical uses. Slowly over time they began to get used in more and more applications and now they appear everywhere.",1526720119

Here is the reality. This quantum computing attack is no more of a danger than a nuclear attack on the network. Think about this. How much would it cost to build and deploy this on bitcoin. It would cost enormous amounts beyond what IBM has. They maybe able to attack the network in some local locations but not the whole network. And breaking the encryption of the network will only allow them to double spend their coins every 10 minutes. And seeing this may persist for a few blocks the nodes can identify the attack and reject those blocks. The quantum attack is no greater of an attack than a 51% attack. ,1526719168

"It was invented to provide USD liquidity between exhanges because money laws are a pain in the pass. People that speculate want a stable currency so they can safeguard their winnings. USD is pretty stable compare to crypto but a bitch to get from one exchange to another.

Tether solves that problem but created two problems in the place.

The first one is that exhanges that run on tether are now extremely useful for laundering fiat money under the cover of ""money won by speculating on crypto"" 
This is why Bitfinex/Tether is doing their best to stay as far away from the USA. But eventually law enforcement is going to crack down, like when their polish banking partner got raided not to long ago. 

The second problem is that Tether is basically fractional reserve  banking in the crytpo exchange ecosystem controlled by one company tether/bitfinex. 

This gives tether/bitfinex an enourmous amount of power.

The price of one  Bitcoin is not 10 000 USD. No ... it's 10 000 of a mix between USD and USDT


This means that if trust in USDT collapses it will bring down the entire market. Because of margin trading with huge rations, trust in USDT collapsing migtht mean we would go back to a total market cap for all crypto of 10 billion dollar instead of 300 billion. 

Eventually Tether is going to fail, but for now it's going strong because EVERYBODY is benefiting. 

However if Tether blows it might mean you wake up one day and the price of Bitcoin is 100 000 USD on the tether exchanges and a 100 dollars on all the other exhanges.

That is the huge risk that comes with the benefits. Nobody asked me if I am okay with those risks, yet I am stuck paying 10 000 USD for a Bitcoin.

This is going to end very badly and an enormous amount of people are going to lose money.  

I don't think Tether was intenteded to be a scam but it has turned in to just another banking pipe dream.

Fractional reserve banking can be pretty stable if you have a goverment behind it. Tether/Bitfinex is not that goverment.

They basically control the entire market. They are stuck with printing these Tethers now to keep the price up. If they stop printing long enough ... the price drops to much. So they print and print and while they print the price of 1 Bitcoin is going down ... but you don't know or see or hear about it because you don't know in that 10 000 USD, what percentage is real USD and what percentage is made up USD. 

But hey, it's not my money. I stopped speculating a long time ago. What's the point of getting rich on other peoples misery? 

And those that have a 100 K in USDT on Tether exchanges, good luck trying to get that money out when everybody else wants to get that money out as well.

Basically the Bitcoin economy now needs to grow exponentially to keep the system stable and that won't happen because it's 99% speculation.

Eventually people are done just playing the speculation game, with prices slowly going back down.

It's only a matter of time before it blows. This should have never happened. If it blows, most altcoins will end right there. And Bitcoin will drop under 1000 USD again. Maybe for 5 years or longer.

"&gt; I'm sure you're aware IBM publicly announced last year they have an operational 50 Qubit Quantum Computer and have a 20 Qubit system available for customers to rent

There's some discontinuity between either.

a) What IBM says (or what people write about them)
b) Current Quantum computing research 
https://phys.org/news/2017-11-physicists-qubit-entanglement.html
Or c) Some other third factor, like a potential lack of understanding of the difference between what IBM is doing and what the resarchers are doing, on my part. I would expect that entanglement is necessary to crack encryption. If you understand the difference here, please let me know.

Pretty sure I read that IBMs public cloud system was only 5 qubit, but even if it is 20, its still tiny. And having a cloud based interface is a far fetch from a product that someone can walk away with. That said, maybe I am looking at that the wrong way. Maybe these systems will always be cloud based and my interpretation of ""commercial use"" is off base.

&gt; I think it foolish to bet everything on the assumption IBM is wrong. I hope they are, but we could do more to be prepared

For data that is encrypted now, that can be captured and archived, and de-crypted later and will still have value when it is eventually de-crypted, sure. With something like BTC, if ECDSA was replaced, I would expect that everything could be re-encrypted or at least made secure enough so that cracking the old encryption didn't matter. So if that is at least partially right, then I don't see those two cases as exactly the same.

"Cool, A reminder will be interesting. 

For the record, I'm not claiming in 5 years we'll have a quantum computer that can crack ECDSA - it is IBM who are now warning this is a possibility and suggesting customers think about their data. Of any company that should know, it is them. But of course they want more projects and sweet software licensing deals.

I'm sure you're aware IBM publicly announced last year they have an operational [50 Qubit Quantum Computer] (https://www.technologyreview.com/s/609451/ibm-raises-the-bar-with-a-50-qubit-quantum-computer/) and have a 20 Qubit system available for customers to rent - in other words 'productized'. Behind the scenes they likely have more and we do not need a productized quantum computer for Bitcoin to get rekt - a fleeting PoC in a lab that produces just one of Satoshi's or a large exchange's private keys would be enough. Confidence would be ruined and the project over.

"&gt; users will not even touch the Bitcoin layer for most purposes, and will be dealing mostly with LN channels.

And since LN is not user-friendly in any way, shape, or form, what logical conclusion does that lead us to..?

&gt; For example, exchanges will be able to load money directly into existing LN channels, or open up the LN channel to a user. Users will just need to run the software and copy/paste their node ID to the exchange.

"Lightning is a smart contract? Dude, it's a tab recording system. It's not even build on-chain. It's a second layer build to keep records of BTC owed by channels and then finalized when closing channels.

Building and development on BTC is not decentralize btw. Everything built in BTC requires permission from blockstream in GitHub otherwise they get demonized. Let me put it this way, if anybody were to suggest any development, nothing gets implemented until blockstream approves it. If I suggest 8mb blocks, they say no, so I'm forcedfork away. But when I fork, I am demonized although it's exactly the same code by with big block size. Instead of acknowledging Bitcoin is open source and decentralize, blockstream has proven that only their permission is considered Bitcoin and anybody who field an open source code is evil so development must be centralized and receive their blessings to be called Bitcoin. Don't go around telling people about BTC being Decentralized, you look stupid and foolish. Linux is Decentralize, you can fork and do whatever you want, you are still Linux but a different flavor. Go learn Decentralization from Linux, not from blockstream.

You talk about sound monetary policy, please clarify, need more context on that. If it's block time, BCH is way much more stable with enhanced DAA stabilizing it at 10 minutes. BTC relies heavily on miners to stabilize it and cannot cope when there are large movements in hashrates.

Your 10 minutes is right, but then so it's every coin in Earth that has a block time. If you demonize BCH for not having sound security, then please, by all means, hack BCH and alter the ledger. Show it, don't just tell me it's lower hashrate. Human greed is what leads the market, all the talk about security and hashrates but nobody attacking cause they want BCH to win, probably because they have some skin in it. Security only fails when it fails, until then, it's all talk but 0 substance. 

Ethereum has 15 seconds block time, why don't BTC attack them as well since their block time is so short, clearly they are having shit Security. /s

Multi sig can be used for smart contracts. It's part of the capability you want to build into a smart contract. Multi sig itself is a function to redeem the coins from a wallet, coupled by an objective and purpose, then it becomes s smart contract.

Also, BTC is on to because it's the main base pairing on exchanges, hence people need to transfer money from one exchange to another using BTC. That's all there is to BTC. Network effect exist because people use it. People use it because it serves a function. The function exist because of the capability built into the coin. If I make a new coin right now, giving it 1mb blocks, 10 minutes block time, does exactly what btc does, when mempool fills up, you need to pay high fees to contend with others to get confirmations, do you want it? I'll call it bytecoin.",1526713359
