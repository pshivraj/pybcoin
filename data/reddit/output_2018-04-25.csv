"This is acctually a good thing. It might positively inspire other government institutions. BY THE WAY, Canada is doing it right to - http://www.cryptovibes.com/crypto-news/government-canada-now-using-ethereum-blockchain/

I am not spaming. I just believe that money in the banks are not OURS. It's their. But I believe, that cryptocurrency we own - is ours only (not talking about precautions it's worth to take).

"Absolutely agree and if I was young free and single I certainly would look at it that way. It's different when you have a job that pays for your 2 children to go to an amazing private school that would cost you 70K to pay for yourself .... got to aim higher just to maintain current situation. Also, don't think there is anything wrong with learning from history and using the fact that crypto goes up and down like (insert joke) to take and reinvest profits at certain milestones. 

Money is not all about Caribbean islands it can be security for you and your extended family.

"Imagine the dominant bitcoin had 32mb blocks with a fleshed out scaling plan including successful testing of GB+ blocks , support by every major crypto business, project, and service, guaranteed sub-cent fees and a more the merrier growth strategy for true global adoption.

Now imagine some upstart devs forked off and reduced block size to 1mb, heavily restricting transactional capacity to create a fluctuating fee market intended to produce long term fees in excess of $100+ driving users to a second layer system of fee taking government regulated financial intermediaries they call ‚Äúhubs‚Äù.

Would this new high fee coin see any traction whatsoever?

It needs to be understood that the current BTC price is the result of incumbency, not merit. Any suggestion that the market could never come to the realisation that the Blockstream/Core redesign of bitcoin was a mistake is pure cult ideology.

BCH is gaining against BTC for very sound fundamental reasons, rational traders need to position themselves to ideally profit or at minimum protect their holdings in the event of a switch.

Besides, BTC did do an increase. But that increase is only limited to Segwit addresses. So for old addresses it's dangerous. But for Segwit addresses it's okay to increase the size somewhat.

My opinion doesn't come from reading Reddit conversations. It's my personal view of my personal analysis of the technologies (including Lightning), developer mindsets and corporate influences. None of your arguments are outside of my considerations.

I'll change the discussion yet again. Bitcoin has its roots in the principles of free market. If blocks get too big for the network to handle then miners and nodes are free to set their own block size limits. The Bitcoin Core devs clearly don't want to give away that control. They're also totalitarian in the way that they're themselves working on Lightning (as opposed to let the market come up with their own 2nd layer solutions) and pushing Lightning as the *single answer* to the scalability problem.

The reality is Blockstream is abusing the block size limit to force their solution.

"The only use cases crypto has demonstrated so far is to bypass govt control, censorship, etc

Bitcoin:

- DarkNetMarkets - buying of drugs, illegal stuff, etc  Bitcoin has been the currency there since it's inception although Monero is gaining some adoption

- Bypassing Capital Controls - in countries like China and other developing countries where you can't freely move money in and out the country.  Hence the exchange ban in China, issues in India, etc

- Cenorship Resistance - Us Escort Ad service bakpage.com used Bitcoin since 2015 after Visa/Mastercard payment networks blocked them.  They made massive money until govt shutdown a week ago.

Also for citizens it allows you to control your own money, store it, move it any way you want to, absolute privacy with some privacy crytpos, easily portable to other countries, remittance to relatives, inheritance, massive volatility but with fiat you have **guaranteed** inflation over the years.  

So you are sacrificing stability for massive volatility but over the long term at least it appears the volatility has been upward movement in value vs devaluation of fiat.  On top of that the argument is as valuation increases, volatility will decrease (remains to be seen)",1524720977
"They're not fundamentals because they don't relate to the function of thing that you're buying and selling; they relate to the buying and selling of the thing.

"If you expect prices to go up then it makes even less sense to continue mining unprofitably. I mean you might be able to make a profit from the price rise but you would make an even bigger profit selling your mining rig and using the money saved on electricity to just buy the currency. After-all, increases in price doesn't necessarily translate into increased profit from mining since the difficulty would also go up.

There are 3 cases where I can see mining unprofitably makes sense:

- when you want to buy a very large amount without disrupting the market. This is no longer a huge concern but with bitcoin in the past mining at a loss resulted in accumulating large amounts where as buying large amounts rapidly pushed up prices. Its also still a strategy for low liquidity altcoins.

- When you want to add security / decentralization to the network even at a loss

- When you dont have any money right now and you are using the ability to mine now pay for the electricity later as a form of credit. 

None of these are really sustainable reasons to mine unprofitably (even mining for security its only needed during an actual attack so you would be better in that case to be buying more hardware for when an attack happens and only switching it on to defend otherwise just run a full but non mining node) ",1524720708

"After Freewallet claimed we posted outdated information in our blog post yesterday and they mentioned that in fact users can change their fees when sending bitcoin. So after we asked where this option was because we couldnt find it anywhere on the app we discovered ourselves (because we never got a response from them) that their desktop website has this feature. This is very  surprising considering the majority of the users don‚Äôt use their desktop wallet, they use the app. Of course the app still does not allow any type of adjustment to the fees they charge to send bitcoin.

Even further once they told us about this feature we made an  attempt to resend the bitcoin that we used for this example yesterday. To no surprise we still couldn't send the bitcoin because their lowest option was still extremely high at 0.0002 btc or $1.80. So really this feature they added to their desktop wallet does nothing and solves nothing as the main issues are still there. As an example the Coinomi Wallet charges $0.04 - $0.08 cents to send users bitcoin and have it confirmed within the next 3 blocks. They even have one cheaper option than that. Coinomi also has real-time fee adjustments in case the bitcoin network gets congested and transaction fees temporarily rise.",1524720261

The reason I'm working for Dash (and not for Bitcoin) is not only because they pay me, but because they are able to pay a whole team of developers (and many other roles, a total of &gt;60 people).

It wonders me that the importance of this is not clear to more people: You need a working team of all kinds of roles and people to build something as huge as we all want to get.

I strongly believe that such projects can't live on a voluntary/donation basis. The group of possible developers who would be able to work this way is just too small.

Example: on 2018-04-22  BTCUSDLONGS closed at 28341.8851 and BTCUSDSHORTS closed at 24171.6528. This tells us that the value of margined longs held at Bitfinex was worth 28341.8851 Bitcoins. You might infer bullish sentiment at that moment because BTCUSDLONGS exceeded BTCUSDSHORTS. But note that the information says nothing about how many traders were involved nor how many longs and shorts. Theoretically, the entire BTCUSDLONGS position (28341.8851 BTC) could be held by just one margin trader, and total longs (ie margined longs + unmargined longs) could be any reasonable number you might imagine. The same conclusions apply to BTCUSDSHORTS.
The misheld belief that longs have to equal shorts is a blowover from futures markets. The concept doesn‚Äôt apply in spot markets. So, even if the misleading names had referred to total longs and shorts, there is no necessity for them to be equal.

I think there is a credible claim to say that BCH is moving towards being an accurate manifestation of what Satoshi first described, but he created a system that was designed to adapt and grow as its collective users directed based on new information and understanding, and I think that's exactly what I've seen happen with BTC.",1524715897

Digital payments like crypro currencies could be a lot cheaper for the business and prevent the worry about fraud or chargebacks but the typing in your wallet address and remembering your address is a real PITA.  Also the volatility makes holding a token for an extended period of time a big gamble.

Ripple with their XRapid/XRP has it going on for their cross-boarder payments with near-instant payments and XRapid can source the XRP from exchanges or liquidity providers to limit the risk of buying and holding a token that could change in value.  Hopefully Ripple's Interledger is the answer to the PITA that is sending crypro to another address and brings crypto payments mainstream.

Bitcoin Cash is a cryptocurrency and worldwide decentralized payment system, meaning that it works without a central bank or government. In mid-2017, the developers not content with the Segregated Witness feature implemented a change to the bitcoin code. The change, called a hard fork, took effect on August 1, 2017. As a result, the bitcoin ledger called the blockchain and the cryptocurrency split in two.

I've looked into and used Nano. I think its tech is interesting, and its community is promising. However, as it exists now, it is not particularly faster than BCH, especially when considering 0-conf, a capability that AFAIK Nano cannot support. Using the native client, it generally takes me almost a minute for a transaction to show up as ""Pending"", and a further 5+ minutes for the ""Pending"" to go away, which I assume means it's ""confirmed"" in one way or another. This doesn't even include considering Nano's clear immaturity (the native client is a UX nightmare), MITM and cold storage deficiencies. Still, I'm intrigued and continue to monitor its development. I also find many things about Byteball interesting, although even when it's fully deployed it will be quite centralized compared to BCH. For now, Byteball is still entirely ""Proof of Tony"".

"BTC was already called Bitcoin before the BCH hard fork. ""Bitcoin Core"" is not a coin, it's a client.

BTC followed a path which you may or may not agree with, but the majority ""voted"" and agreed that that's the right way to go. Just because you don't agree with the decision, it doesn't mean that BTC it's not Bitcoin anymore. Also, people don't write whitepapers every time a new proposal is accepted by the community.

If BCH, a hard fork, has the right to use (""usurp""?) the ""Bitcoin"" name, I'm sure that BTC is also allowed to use that name. As you know, other forks also exist and are just as ""real Bitcoin"" as Bitcoin Cash... they follow the whitepaper but don't claim to be the original Bitcoin.

Regarding the ""common opinion"", if you hangout with BCH supporters, of course you'll have a pro-BCH opinion. Same thing for BTC supporters.

"Incorrect, many of the smaller forks *do* have users claiming their's is the ""one true Bitcoin"". The difference is, everyone can read [the white paper](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin) for themselves and decide which implementation is the closest, and that has legitimately followed the prescribed Nakamoto consensus for protocol evolution. Personally, I think nothing comes close to Bitcoin Cash (BCH) in this regard. If and when BCH's valuation exceeds BTC's, it will satisfy *every* criteria to claim it is the one legitimate ""Bitcoin"" (in my opinion, it already can lay claim to every other criteria.)  

The reason BTC is no longer ""Bitcoin"" in my estimation, is that it is now supported by a monolithic community completely tolerant of a centralized developer cabal that has pointedly and repeatedly subverted the white paper's prescribed Sybil-resistant method for evolving ""Bitcoin"". The clearest example of this is SegWit: the fact that it currently exists on the BTC block chain at all is entirely illegitimate. ""How can you say this?"" you might ask. It's very simple, SegWit1x (SegWit by itself) never exceeded 40% of miner hash rate support. In fact, in languished mostly between 30% and 35% for months on end. The consensus agreement which finally did garner high support, and under which SegWit was to be legitimately added to BTC (following Nakamoto Consensus) was SegWit2x. Well, where is the ""2x"" portion of that consensus agreement now? Since it was never added as promised, the addition of SegWit to BTC is illegitimate. It flouts the white paper on its face. How can such a cryptocurrency still want to claim the name *defined by that very white paper*? And the bigger problem is the entire BTC community is now entirely OK with actions such as censorship, propaganda, astroturfing, gaslighting, DDoS attack, vote brigading, falsely posting negative reviews of products and services that they don't like, organizing ""legal claims"" that have no basis in law, etc., etc. For Bitcoin's first 8.5 years, BTC followed the white paper. Up until August of 2017, the community had the balancing contingent of those that support on-chain scaling, logical consistency, and honesty to balance out the faction led by a vocal and unethical minority. Since then, the on-chain scaling contingent has entirely left for BCH, and the cesspool that remains is now left to stew in its own juices.",1524711377

"**Gaslighting**

Gaslighting is a form of manipulation that seeks to sow seeds of doubt in a targeted individual or in members of a targeted group, hoping to make them question their own memory, perception, and sanity. Using persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, and lying, it attempts to destabilize the target and delegitimize the target's belief.

Instances may range from the denial by an abuser that previous abusive incidents ever occurred up to the staging of bizarre events by the abuser with the intention of disorienting the victim. The term owes its origin to the 1938 Patrick Hamilton play Gas Light and its 1940 and 1944 film adaptations.

Once that happens, you can turn up super nodes while you build up the stake for a full super nodes.

That people want to regulate Bitcoin?  Doesn't sound like that big of a piece of news.,1524710006
"Dang OP, I was working on this topic for our site, but you covered it very well. Many crypto investors don‚Äôt define DCA correctly. I see many in these subs buying more of their coins when prices drop and then call doing that DCA. That isn‚Äôt true DCA. While it lowers your cost basis in a coin, it isn‚Äôt DCA. I‚Äôve also seen people describe tiered or laddered entry into crypto as DCA. While this is a smart strategy that I use often, it isn‚Äôt DCA. 

DCA offers several major benefits for investors. DCA is simply committing to invest a set amount on a set date and time over a long period of time. 

-successful market timing over a long term is nearly impossible. This has been confirmed in many independent academic papers. DCA removes the lure of trying to time the market and takes that variable out. 

-DCA removes investor emotion from the investment process. Is the price too high? Doesn‚Äôt matter, invest at noon on Mondays. Should I buy this dip or wait, I‚Äôm afraid prices will go lower? Doesn‚Äôt matter, buy Monday at noon.

-DCA forces investor discipline. Many people never get ahead of their personal budgets because they fail to save on a regular basis. Setup an automatic transfer, setup the automatic buy, and 5 years from now you will be much better off.

DCA can‚Äôt be looked at as a one time strategy. In other words, you don‚Äôt just decide to commit $1,000 to crypto and then setup 6 buys of $200 per week then stop. You set it up to work over a long period of time. Using short examples of a few weeks or a few months to compare returns isn‚Äôt the point of DCA. It‚Äôs a tool for those who want to increase net worth in 5-10 years, and it works very well for this. No one can successfully time market tops, bottoms, and direction over a 5 year period, and even 1 or 2 small timing mistakes can crush returns.

Smart investors think long term and use DCA as one tool. ",1524709960
"Don‚Äôt mean to break up the incoming nano shill but the average joe isn‚Äôt going to take the time join Coinbase, buy btc/ltc/eth then transfer it to an exchange to buy nano then call their family and teach them how to set up a nano wallet or sign up on an exchange so they can then turn the nano back into btc/ltc/eth so they can sell it for cash. The nano the person receives would be worthless to them since they would not be able to buy anything with it right now.

I could maybe see the person buying btc or ltc and sending it but even that requires multiple hoops for the person on the other end to jump through before they can buy much so it‚Äôs not even worth it right now.

I believe adoption is coming in the future but it‚Äôs not here yet. The average person has no use for nano right now even if it has zero fees because they can‚Äôt buy anything with it.

"The problem is, when BTC artificially hobble itself thinking this helps it be a better store value, you leave the field wide open for a version of Bitcoin that doesn't make that error.

This is how and why Bitcoin attained market value despite being useless at first:

&gt;Investors who invest based on a sound assessment of Bitcoin's future potential serve as a proxy for actual present commercial adoption by boosting the price in the present to a degree commensurate with how likely commercial adoption will be to take hold in the future.

"If Lightning takes off and actually does what it claims it does,  I don't see why Bitcoin Cash would not consider adopting it.

Funny part is Lightning, at some point, is going to require a larger block size hard fork.  I've seen that mentioned quite a number of times on Lightning discussions.  But the roadmap seems to be to get Lightning to a point where it's widely adopted before they choose to go that route.

&gt;As far as I understand it, all you need is some type of maleability fix to use Lightning

Maleability was fixed in BIP-63 and then again in BIP-66, and BIP-141 claims that that their maleability fix fixes a problem with the one in BIP-63.  But there is no technical detail around whether the fix in BIP-141 is only needed by Segwit, or if non-Segwit blockchains will also experience the issue.

Are you a member of this community? The CFTC has a bounty out on PnD groups, if you have access to PnDs in progress or evidence of previous PnDs they have tried to pull you can report to the CFTC and potentially get a 10-30% reward of any monetary sanctions above $1,000,000.

You can go to https://www.whistleblowers.gov if you are interested, they may investigate and if they do end up enforcing monetary sanctions you could be greatly rewarded.

I know people in the cryptocurrency community generally frown on ""snitching"" but PnDs prey on uneducated investors. It hurts crypto as a whole, it's illegal, immoral, and the crypto community needs to work together to enforce these laws as the government does not have the resources to do so. I know the crypto community hates anything government, but at this point there is no self regulatory body that can act with teeth, so this is really one area we should be working with the government to eliminate scammers that hurt cryptocurrencys reputation.",1524707839

Apples to oranges. Segwit and legacy are both ways of transferring Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash is an entirely different, centralised, lower value network.

Also, consider this: most of us (at least myself) didn‚Äôt invest all the fiat I wanted to put in crypto all at once. Instead, you buy here and there, potentially big sums depending on market movements. With DCA, you put the same amount at the same frequency, disregarding market movements.

"Crypto is a long, long game. 

I recently picked up a side job creating content for various blogs - one of them is a crypto blog. As a result, I've had to do a lot of articles about various crypto use cases. 

The TL;DR of all of them is - blockchain is going to solve some major, major problems in some major, major industries. But that's going to take a long, long time. 

Some of the more established industries don't really have an incentive to change yet because no one has realistically challenged them in hundreds of years. Others, like health care, are just intrinsically conservative. I still fill out a paper form on a cliptoard when I go to the doctor.

"Have I unloaded any FUD?  I have not.  I've just watched 3 different YouTube videos abut Lightning and they all said that Lightning without Segwit is ""unsafe"" or ""dangerous"" and they never bothered to explain why.

So, I want to know.  If you don't want to help explain, the move along.  Obviously you don't understand the technical details behind how Bitcoin operates other than parroting ""Segwit good.  Big block bad.""  Well, I actually want to LEARN SOMETHING.  Heaven forbid people have an open mind and try to educate themselves.

Of course the next question is, is the maleability fix introduced in BIP -141 something other cryptos that DO NOT use Segwit such as Bitcoin Cash (or any of the others out there) need to worry about, or is the specific maleability fix in BIP-141 something that is only required because of Lightning.  Other than Segwit, BIP-141 obviously fixes a problem.  But does it fix a problem created by Segwit (which is fine.  Better to fix it at implementation, rather than find out later down the road), or does it fix a problem that currently exists in other blockchains.  If that issue exists in other blockchain, can it be fixed without Segwit?  Meaning is the maleability issue present in other blockchains correctable without implementing Segwit? ",1524706096
"Absolutely. One of the underappreciated aspects of crypto is that it is exposing an entire generation to the mechanics and ideas behind the financial system. How many people learned what ""arbitrage"" means last year :D ",1524706094
"Seeing as the BTC network is acting as a massive R&amp;D platform for (insert block chain buzzword) and is primarily being purchased as a speculative commodity, the fee is cheap. It has far surpassed any expectations of being utilized as a currency whether it's decentralized or not; in terms of border hopping and anonymity. People buy it for potential value. 

BCH has certainly adapted itself to use as a currency for purposes of transacting commodities, but I'd argue that it lacks the draw of a speculative investment in comparison to BTC. 

Anyone putting real money into crypto isn't concerned about paying a fee or the speed of transaction as much as they are the proof of ownership. 

I feel the fork created two separate financial instruments and to compare the two is somewhat of a moot topic. 

Absolutely true that as a system of transaction, BTC fails in comparison to BCH; although as a long term alternative to holding wealth outside of fiat, BTC remains and should likely continue to remain the financial instrument of choice among those more concerned with speculative value. As the first financial instrument of its type, this is inherent for a given period of time; however it will run its course, more than likely once transaction fees equal that of trading fees more commonly associated with traditional stock and bond type financial instruments.

My two cents at least, I hodl both.",1524706092

"You know what? There‚Äôs a greedy little part of me that wants this to play out - regulation be damned.

I mean, don‚Äôt get me wrong: I have my stake in crypto. But, there‚Äôs an anarchist little red devil on my shoulder that wants the world to see what unchecked capitalism does. The beauty of it is, up until now, the one true universal regulation has been Time itself. People could find ways to avoid The Man, but there was never a way to avoid the speed of transactions - the time it takes to move markets. That slow speed of transaction kept the majority of people off the game (along with as much money), and made the wave of ups and downs slow enough to be off the perceptual radar of as many people.

Now we have the internet and computers. Nearly everyone has access, the money to throw around, a continual stream of information coming in, and the ability to perform transactions from the palm of their hand. If a smart kid wanted, they could even make their own trading bots or run a mining rig. That hugely accelerates the movement of transaction time.

So now, when we take away all the man-made regulations, and realize the regulation of Time has also been taken away, we begin to see the markets move around at increasing frequency and volume.

I hope it breaks. Just so people know whether it was right or wrong all this time to be going on about the free market; whether or not we should have regulation in them, etc.

Yea, there are ways to play consumers into believing something is worth more than it is, no doubt.  Beats by Dre are a good example; they take advantage of the perception that heft = quality.

&gt; Regardless, I'm extremely skeptical of BCH's potential to usurp bitcoin.

I agree; the technical merits of a larger blocksize do not outweigh the value of the network effect, especially since Segwit already granted 1/2 the blocksize and LN will make room for even more txns, so BCH's big claim to superiority is not nearly as strong as they make it seem.

This is happening right now, so let's cut the bullshit: some people own BHC and would like it succeed. If you think this is acceptable, well, it's your opinion, but let me tell you that you're wrong if you think that only BTC have people money influencing the development.

"Calling bcash a ""side"" is misleading at best, as it gives the illusion that bitcoin and bcash are equal in sizes.  It is like saying that there are ""sides"" in the discussion of climate change.

"I never said I had a degree.  You don't need a degree to know why you should use Bitcoin over Bitcoin Cash.

The question is do you think Bitcoin should be centrally controlled by a handful of people, or do you think Bitcoin should be as decentralized as humanly possible?  

If you're okay with Bitcoin being centrally controlled then the biggest problem with Bitcoin cash is that the Bitcoin network is significantly stronger.   Like 10% of the bitcoin network could rewrite the entire bitcoin cash chain in a few months.  That's a big risk.  

Covert asic boost is also a very big problem with Bitcoin Cash.   It means that one man has a significant competitive advantage to mining protected by the state through copyright law.  Ever wonder why Bitmain was the only ASIC provider for years?  Now that Segwit pretty much put an end to covert ASIC boost we are starting to see competition?  No, Bitmain wasn't just ""smarter' than the competitors they found a hack and exploited it. 

If you're not okay with Bitcoin being centrally controlled, and you believe that people have a right to participate in their monetary system.  Then you have the problem of block propagation.  It's important that Bitcoin remain lightweight so that it can run over censorship resistant networks like TOR.  It also helps if we can setup Bitcoin nodes over satellite and mesh networks.

Bitcoin is the vanguard ... it's the crypto that takes a beating.  The reason Governments are working with Bitcoin and crypto right now rather than against it is because they can't stop Bitcoin.  They can stop other crypto currencies.  It doesn't help them to do that though if they can't take down Bitcoin first.    ",1524702775

What‚Äôs worse is exchanges don‚Äôt generate on chain transactions when you convert fiat to BTC or when you trade it.  So these increased price doesn‚Äôt mean more transactions on the blockchain directly.  ,1524701227

"the problem with bitcoin is a lot people who dont know how investing works, they expect it to go up or only down, which is not the case in any market, but they don't understand, so when they see it go down a bit everyone panics and what should be a small dip turns into a crash, same thing in other direction, people see it go up and they all jump on because they don't want to miss out. People need to learn that time in the market is much better than timing the market. If you truly believe in what your investing in, then buy it and don't worry about short term numbers",1524700799

The stupid part about all of this is that I'm missing out on these hard dips and could potentially lose a lot of profit depending on how long it takes to fix this. Absolutely ridiculous.

"This is a joke. Compare activity of the dozens of active bitcoin core contributors with those 'multiple team' (of 1/2 Dev). Not to mention there are other implementations of bitcoin full nodes like bcoin, libbitcoin etc.. with just as many Devs as the reference implementation of BCH (ABC).

For most people it seems crazy to throw in with a shady entrepreneur with no coding background over the vast majority of Bitcoin developers. Adhering to the white paper like the Bible over attempting to find ways to solve real scaling problems seems like a weirdly Luddite approach to something as novel as block chain tech. If you weren't as dense as you seem you'd be attempting to illuminate people as to why BCash is technologically Superior to BTC. Something tells me you don't have that info- hence your name calling and general annoying demeanor,1524700514

"Good job mate.  
Unless you are ... rich and $9k isn't a lot of money for you I wouldn't advice into buying all at ones.  
What I mean is, to me personally $9k is quite a lot of money. I understand it isn't to everyone.  
However let's say you have the number X you want to put into crypto - put it gradually, over the course of 2 to 4 weeks.  
If it goes up - it goes up with % of the money you thought to invest so you don't loose much. If it goes down during these 2-4 weeks if you feel good as you are now buying cheaper coins.  
So 1 coin, eh? Where's your second I ask?",1524700462
"Why? This is like 90&amp;#37; of the people dealing in crypto now. You can see this mentality changing on forums and Reddit during the dips, I think it was fantastic.",1524700425
"I think a lot of the frustration BTC supporters have with BCH can be summed up in a first and last name (Roger Ver).  As for tech, while differing views exist, one is clearly called Bitcoin and another, Bitcoin Cash.  If BTC is usurped, we'll all know what Bitcoin is.  As long as BTC leads, it will be called Bitcoin by the majority of people.

&amp;nbsp;

A lot of what Ver has done with the Bitcoin Foundation and Bitcoin.com has been pretty scummy, as it tricks potential crypto investors into buying a product they don't want.  If they were informed, this would be another matter.  Admittedly, BCH has to contend with BTC's hold on the pre-fork brand name, but if BCH can prove more viable, this shouldn't be an issue, and investor manipulation wouldn't be required.",1524700424
"Many can though like xrp (assist fiat), golemn (cloud like computing), storage coins etc. Many coins serve an application purpose. The currency coins like btc or ltc serve as entries and barriers to the market to invest in other coins. Navcoin/navpay can help with low fee transfers to friends.

We dont need to be antifiat entirely for stuff to succeed. What we need is 3-4 years time for alot of cryptos to be fully developed and live. Can't wait for 2021, the year of the sealab",1524700408
"&gt;The problem is that those phrases are intentionally deceptive. ""Bitcoin Core"" is a popular software implementation of the **Bitcoin** protocol.

Yes, it's the MOST popular implementation so far, but using that for any other purpose than to say BTC is more popular than BCH would be an ad-populous fallacy.

&gt; ""Bitcoin Cash"" is the name of an altcoin that was created in August '17 by cloning the Bitcoin transaction history. 

If BTC is an implementation of the Bitcoin protocol, BCH also is. Why calling it an altcoin? If it's the same protocol and the same transaction history it's the same coin, only time will tell which of the two chains wins, it's all very clear on the white paper.

&gt; Commonly referred to as Bcash,

Mostly by trolls, as BCash has several meanings, here in Brazil BCash is a relatively common way to pay for online stuff, much more accepted than BTC, but has nothing to do with crypto currency.

&gt; it is not compatible with Bitcoin in any way.

Why not? The only breaks on transaction backward compatibilities were made to prevent wrong spends from a BTC address to a BCH inicio and vice versa.

&gt; It is entirely separate, and any attempt to associate the two is an attempt to deceive those who aren't able to determine the difference for themselves. 

Except they aren't, same protocol, same technology, same block chain, the paper predicts this sort of works as the way to upgrade the technology, if only one chain remains on the long run that chain becomes Bitcoin, while two exists they're two different Bitcoin implementations. This sort of split also can happen without a fork of the code but by mere chance.

&gt; Bitcoin is Bitcoin. Bcash is Bcash.

And BCore is BCore.",1524700384
"This is why I never buy at one position.  
Firstl - I already have some satoshis.  
So as I am working my way up to the full btc if I have $500 laying around I dont just buy NOW, I buy for $100.  
Then I put another b uy order, limit, with price $200 lower than it is now, and another 3 to follow with $200 lower than the previous.  
This way - if I buy with just 1/5th of my money I still make some profit and if it drops after my initial purchase I am happy it did as I am buying more with the same money! It's a WIN-WIN situation.",1524700310
"I assumed most of these Crypto Influencers sit around the same table, 9 - 5. Lots of them spam lists of top people to follow, and all of them are on the same lists. Usually notable exceptions with huge followings who never make the list, like Philakone etc.

On the flip side I doubt these devices will be perfectly adaptable, which means anyone inclined against them should be able to develop algorithms or mining protocols that are incompatable with these devices. Again, Bitcoin and any customers for this lose out.

What Bitmain must really be terrified about is Nano. It's a direct competitor to bcash as a cash replacement coin, but gets rid of miners entirely.

"I have an idea. First the problem: People basically underappreciate and take advantage of volunteer devs. The Bitcoin Fund, the marketing‚Äã arm, got funded no problem for two reasons. First people understand no money no marketing. That doesn't strictly go for devs, but devs like Amaury, Gavin, Jeff, Mike etc are too nice to erect an ultimatum: pay for my value or get no production. So they just slog along, under paid, best they can. Would you have your Ferrari worked on by a personal mechanic who was malnourished and sick? Or would you make sure their resources were at their best? Devs are not good fundraisers nor beggars, they're good engineers, rare ones at that.

So the idea. Ever wonder why we see all those Dash crypto ads? It's because if I'm not mistaken a marketing budget is built into the coin reward system. The money gets set aside up front. I propose something similar for development. Why do we pay miners a block reward? It's for network security. We don't mind that value being high as we appreciate higher network security. But do they need 100%? How can a network be secure without the mechanics - the good ones - that work on it at a fundamental level?

We're a community that doesn't mind hard fork and it would take one to do this, but we could set aside some small dev budget from block rewards. We could‚Äã add marketing too if desired. My idea is miners in addition to specifying their own reward address, indicate one or two other addresses a small percentage went to. The highest vote getting addresses among miners would win the stipend. Of course addresses would be published by various dev and/or marketing teams. What do you think? Side note: at 1K we have about $1.8M per day in miner security or $657M yearly. Just taking 1% of that, spread among all miners, which would be tiny is $6.5M per year.",1524697487

"&gt; But you could, theoretically, buy a burger with a fraction of a Bitcoin, like a dollar or a pound. That's an important distinction, isn't it? Or is it just because nobody wants to go through the hassle of figuring out burgers to AAPL?

You've hit the crux of the issue.

In the world of finance, you can, in fact, buy stuff with marketable securities. If I want to buy your company, and your company is worth $2M, I can tender you $2M worth of AAPL. Damn straight. Happens all the time. 

&gt; Or is it just because nobody wants to go through the hassle of figuring out burgers to AAPL?

Yes, that is exactly correct. And here is the rub - cryptocurrency, because it is such a total, ongoing clusterfuck - is *much harder to value* and convert to cash in a way that is meaningful for consumer transactions. The cryptocurrency that was used to purchase pizzas, years ago, is now worth insanely large amounts of money. You do *not* want a consumer transactino medium to be so absurdly volatile as crypto-currency. Additionally, the loud, lengthy protestations of cryptofanatics notwithstanding, crypto is a gigantic pain in the ass to transfer compared to cash, or even stocks. For stock - I just call my broker or transfer agent. Done. I can also log in to my handy online portal. For crypto, however, you need a wallet. Second, you want to check if you have been hacked in the last 90 seconds - which, you know, good chance of that. Third, how the fuck do you buy crypto in the first place? I know how - but most people don't. Fourth, are you actually aware of the fact it is remarkably easy to track someone's crypto purchase history? It is basically a public record. Why on earth you would want that is beyond me. 

Crypto is *like* money, but harder and worse. It is subject to all of the rules that make it inconvenient to buy burgers with shares of AAPL and, frankly - I just do not see it being a cash equivalent anytime in the near future. 

&gt; Is that because of some sort of globally agreed-upon law or treaty, or is it just because that's the way it's always been?

Little of both. Here, in the US, if you try to issue a currency, yeah, you will run into legal trouble. Second, internationally, even if you do not break any law - who is going to give a shit? Just ask [Zimbabwe, an actual government, about trying to issue its own currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe). Or [Venezuela](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/03/23/venezuela-hopes-to-tackle-the-worlds-worst-inflation-by-deleting-zeros-from-its-currency/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.eb6668309ac9). Or even fucking Brazil - a real, giant economy that had huge currency problems, hence the [Real](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_real). The problem with doing currency right it is that it is *insanely* hard. *Crypto*currency does not address *any* of those hard parts, as far as I am concerned. So the point is, even the legal issues aside - why should cryptocurrency solve *any* of these problems? It wasn't designed to. Frankly, the central problem of cryptocurrency - double spending - is just like... a non-issue. Sell-side fraud *outrageously* exceeds sell-side fraud. I.e., cryptocurrency (read Nakamoto's whitepaper) was designed to avoid a seller of goods or services from being fleeced. That sort of crime is *so much less prevalent* than people sending money to fraudsters - whether they be securities frauds or scam artists - that it is insane to build an entire currency around. Additionally, all the shit that credit card companies do - like escrows and chargebacks - are actually hugely, hugely complicated, and they are dismissed *in their entirety* as trivial by the Nakamoto white paper. 

But that is the opinion of one man. One man who does this stuff for a living, but one man nonetheless. ",1524694655

&gt; A physical brick and mortar ‚Äúcrypto bank‚Äù can aid in transitioning those more resistant to change.  Beginners will be able to speak face to face with a professional who can guide them through the process

Yeah sure good luck with that. The price fluctuations alone make this an impossible concept until the price stabilizes similar to USD. This is because if last month the price of Bitcoin is 5K, and this month the price is 10K and next month it's 6k, then it's impossible to structure your business to pay your employees because the price is taking wild shifts. Let's say you charge a 5% fee to purchase Bitcoin, that means on the lean months your customer base drops significantly and now you're overstaffed. If it's a high month, then now you're understaffed. Your fee would have to change with the price, so when the price drops, your fees increase to make up the difference.

But then you have to figure out why anyone would want a cryptocurrency bank in the first place. The ""bank"" part is sorely missing since the bank wouldn't even dream of any kind of payment protection or Bitcoin ""accounts"" because that's what wallets are for. Then, you have to wonder who would even go into one? If you are a Bitcoin user already, you will just buy it off of an exchange for less than the brick and mortar ""bank"" and let's be honest, the cost of running a physical bank far exceeds the cost of running a website. If you're not a Bitcoin user, then you might be the target audience...until you discover exchanges where you can drastically lower the fees you pay for Bitcoin. 

What a dumb concept. ",1524693671
"Anyone that bought alt coins in late March/early April is protecting their profits by converting to their mainstay, probably BTC but maybe ETH, and readjusting their portfolios. The most popular trade on Shapeshift for the last 24 or so is BCH to BTC. All the profit has got to go somewhere and I don‚Äôt think it is being converted back to fiat in percentages that will tank the market. It might be, but unless you are a Bcash believer you should be selling for something less volatile, and then reallocating small amounts into other alts that you think have promise. Same goes for EOS, Mithril, and everything else that had a fantastic run these past couple of weeks. That process takes time. If BTC finds support at 9K everything we‚Äôve gained recently is still relatively in place. If BTC heads back down to far (8K?) then people will start to bail on alts and hunker down in BTC until another buy signal emerges. And new fiat will probably enter the market to pick up the relatively cheap BTC, ETH and BCH we all had access to in late March/early April. 

TL;DR If BTC stabilizes above 9K don‚Äôt shit the bed. If it falls to far below 9K expect an alt sell off.

"Having an overly restricted or at-capacity network opens up vulnerabilities as a result of the **free market**. Because there will always be an alternative solution available, your premise is always correct.

If N = the **token cost** to fill the next block to capacity, then BCH is N^8 more resistant to a transaction flooding or ""spam"" attack for each following block as compared to BTC, which when combined with RBF can be an easy way to double-spend without miner collusion; for BCH this value will soon be N^32.

As a result, it is currently ‚àö8 per block less costly to carry out an extended flood campaign against BTC, and as you've pointed out: any large miner can recoup most or all of their own costs with the combination of rising fees and mining their own transactions. However, the longer you want to keep fees rising the more expensive this attack gets over time.

This is all by design. The United States has gone through great lengths to make sure the USD is the defacto currency governments use to trade everything, even *commodities* like oil. The most powerful weapon the United States has in it's arsenal is the USD. Many entities have attempted (and are attempting now) to de-legitimatize the USD but if it didn't happen in 2008 (and more importantly the years afterwards), it will take an apocalyptic event in order to dethrone the USD.

"explaination on what we are doing to followers of mine which holds no

channel that freenode channel is not secured. Anyone would be able to spoof
a nick that is on the invite list to freely enter that channel when the nick is
not in used. I took advantage of that again, to create chaos and leak logs
that I failed in the dump, of which after the dump failed to 170, I drove prices
back up to 190. The purpose of this is crystal clear. I need someone to buy
into my dumps high, while slowly driving prices to 130. To those who are in
the private channel especially ops such as randomclown, Tuxedage,
Sir_Knee_Grows, SuchWow and taner, would have clearly known that 130
will be the bottom price. Taner appeared to be more excited. He had a bet

satoshis will definitely be a rock bottom.

listens to my order to buy or sell are away. And the part that I stated
dogecoin will be trading above 200 once Chinese New Year ends? Yep, you
now you recalled. Well, I orchestrated another plan. Which is to move my
people inside my private channel to UNO/BTC for I saw value in UNO and
were at a good price to buy at. This serves two purposes. If they are out at
160 and bought in UNO heavily, it will be less selling pressure for me to exit
my investors funds. At this point of time, investors holding of doge are not
yet fully sold. To others, it might have appeared that I used my members
into selling DOGE/BTC and UNO/BTC but apparently, it is not the case. I gave
them the chance of buying UNO/BTC at a lower price, having sufficient time
to build up their position for UNO/BTC has much greater potential and
without having worrying that they will be affecting my dumps on DOGE on a
later date. Killing two birds with one stone.

Now, halving date for DOGE is now nearer and nearer. People are gullible and
naive thinking that during halving their doge prices will be worth double of the
280's initial tops. They forgotten that it is us the whales, that drives prices
up. Again, they fell for the deception that I long for. Near halving day, what a
perfect day for my dumps. I will have a lot of people that will actively and
happily buying out whatever I dumped to them. On Feb 12, I dropped the
nuclear warhead. It was what I expected and I managed to exit my position
entirely on DOGE.

engage the opposing force. And to those who loses out in the end are usually

While dogecoin hits 50-70 satoshis, the truth is, I did not owned 10 billion

overstated so as to aid me and mask by exit strategy in the near future.
Now, came the part of Jamaican bobsled team. It was a perfect time for
other whales and myself. We signal through buy/sell walls that we are ready
to move. It was a test pump. We wanted to see if the dogecoin community
were gullible enough to think that it was the Jamaican bobsled publicity that
have drove dogecoin prices up. The bobsled team brought value and publicity
to dogecoin, but people are always confuse with prices and value. Having
value does not mean having a price, and having a high price does not mean it
has value. In the world of manipulation, we used the news, the social
network as our advantage. We were right, by droving prices up, the
community gave credit to the bobsled team for moving dogecoin prices up,
which is what I wanted.

Over a course of a week, I begin appearing frequently on #dogecoin and
#dogecoin-market giving trade calls and announcing pumps. To cut the story
short, I turned aggressive, driving prices up to 280 satoshis where the crowd
bought into my sell walls. I was able to exit near 270 a portion of my
dogecoins. I wasn't done with it. Driving prices higher will put me into a risk
of buying dogecoin high and unable to exit safely.

This is the part where I gave everyone on #dogecoin-market a floor, 160
satoshis. A precise floor that I will support, and 230 as resistance. I moved
prices up and down within this range to gain confidence and support from the
community that I am backing it and able to control doge prices at will. Then
came the part of which I need more faithful followers, who will ride the
waves with me, gurantee a few profits, and act with me. Why? Reason is

"To almost everyone, it is simply just pump and dump. However, the truth is,
there are many stages to make a pump and dump successful. The stages
includes:

1) Position Building
2) Suppressing prices
3) Test Pump
4) Actual Pump
5) Shakeouts
6) Re-allocation and distribution
7) Exiting - The Dump

Position Building
There are multiple ways to build a position. This is the stage where we will
require a significant amount of market share to do pumps. The most
common method will be micro buys. Through placing of buy order in
relatively small amounts, it avoids driving up prices and also masked our
existence. Some alternate coins, however, has really low amount of volume,
and it will take ages to build up our position through micro buys. In such
cases, we will be force to do a pump up, to encourage sellers. Pump waves
will be gradually decreasing, smaller and smaller, forcing out all sellers so that
we can have what we want - market share. This has happened many times
infact to date, such as Doge/BTC, UNO/BTC, Dev/BTC and GLC/BTC.
Suppressing prices

Contradicting isn't it? That we are willing to pump altcoins up a few times of
it's value worth before driving down it prices. And yes, like I have stated
earlier on, prices does not matter to us as long we can sell higher. However,
like every other business on the industry, everyone would want their costs to
be as low as possible. In this very stage, we will pile up whatever we have
bought, to suppress prices as much as possible through sell walls so that we
are able to do our buying cheap. Our sell walls are usually just enough to
appear as though as it's the invisble hands of the market, minor supply over
demand.

Test Pump

"I'd recommend putting in $50-$100 a week and try to time it with a dip. It will slowly keep rising. If you buy for one month let's say 8,900 then the following month you buy at an average of 7,000. When that next pump happens and it jumps back to 8,900 or higher than your already making a profit. I look at is as a savings acct. A very risky one at that. You should have your safe one in a bank, 401k, etc and also have a small side one of crypto. In time it will grow, especially if you keep pumping Fiat into your wallet. It won't hurt and one day you will be surprised how much you've ammassed. It also is an addictive way to put money away and makes you want to save more in life. ",1524690934
"Majority believes that markets move randomly and reflect the collective
wisdom of investors, the truth is quite the opposite. The invisible hand is a
myth. Market prices has always been manipulated by the government's
visible hands through influencing laws and regulation. Insiders control markets
and manipulate them up or down for profit. Manipulation is everywhere,
undeniable and unavoidable. It happens on a very large scale throughout
every single financial markets out there, stock, bonds, commodities,
currencies and so forth. There are other types of manipulation, such as social
and news manipulation, hence I called it: The Game of Deception.
""Whale watching"" is a trading strategy of monitoring the trades of the most
influential or wealthy investors, known as ""whales"". ""Whales"" refers to
traders with significant bankrolls that their actions impact heavily on the
markets. The purpose of this book is to trade in the shadow of the smart
money, understanding how market manipulation works, and become
profitable by understanding.
Most traders do not understand volume implications and how vital it is in
their analysis of any of the markets. Given at any point of time, traders are
constantly long, short, holding, some waiting to get into the market, some
already in profitable positions. ""Long"" means when a trader buys, in this
example: DOGE/BTC hoping that the value of Doge will go up against BTC,
the ""Short"" means the opposite. Whenever a trade is entered, the exchange
will register this as volume on a continuous ongoing basis. Volume represents
activity and it relates to the price bar on your chart. Chart reflects clearly and
is the reason why it is behaving the way it is. ""Whales"" contributes 70-80%
of the volume you see, which is why it is large enough to alter the direction
of a market. I will not go into identifying the traces of a whale activity in book
one, but rather my primary focus would be explaining how manipulation
works, and the thoughts of a market manipulator.

are meticulous in entering a trade, cracking your head whether the price you
are about to buy or sell is too high or low, although some might possess
knowledge of technical analysis, you are still at a loss in the end. This is quite
common, for you have not understand the characteristic of a ""whale"". They
are ruthless, swift, cunning, very very patient and most importantly, they do

"The chart for BCH is wrong, because it does not calculation for what is estimated to be necessary, it's just calculating a mean or average (that currently includes quite a bit of ridiculously high fees paid as a result of bad fee estimating code carried over from BTC wallets). The values from the three BTC fee estimating sites I posted are equivalent to 1 sat/B on the BCH chain in terms of effectiveness. To guarantee a fair comparison, I already increased the BCH requirement unnecessarily by 20%.",1524690835
"**Economic bubble**

An economic bubble or asset bubble (sometimes also referred to as a speculative bubble, a market bubble, a price bubble, a financial bubble, a speculative mania, or a balloon) is trade in an asset at a price or price range that strongly exceeds the asset's intrinsic value. It could also be described as a situation in which asset prices appear to be based on implausible or inconsistent views about the future. Asset bubbles date back as far as the 1600s and are now widely regarded as a recurrent feature of modern economic history. Historically, the Dutch Golden Age's Tulipmania (in the mid-1630s) is often considered the first recorded economic bubble.

But what I still don‚Äôt understand, Roger, is why YOU still like BTC more than BCH? What self-respecting, anarcho-capitalist, rational free actor would hold more of his personal wealth (by a wide margin) in BTC than BCH if he actually thinks BCH is better?

""Building a rules-based marketplace is critical to our mission to build the future of money ‚Äî individuals and institutions need to feel safe and secure when trading. To that end, we are excited to announce that over the coming months we will be implementing Nasdaq‚Äôs SMARTS Market Surveillance technology to monitor our marketplace.

Ôøº

SMARTS Market Surveillance, which is considered the most widely deployed surveillance system in the world, will enable us to monitor across all of our trading pairs, including BTC/USD, ETH/USD and BTC/ETH. Further, SMARTS will surveil our newly launched Gemini Block Trading‚Ñ¢, as well as Gemini Auctions‚Ñ¢, which are used to determine the settlement price for the Bitcoin (USD) Futures Contracts that trade on Cboe‚Äôs CFE Exchange under the ticker symbol ‚ÄúXBT‚Äù (contract specifications | fact sheet).¬†

Adding trade surveillance technology is the most recent development in our efforts to build a rules-based marketplace, which already includes: (i) an Information Sharing Agreement with Cboe Exchange, Inc. allowing for cross-market surveillance, (ii) our internal Trading Policy with respect to material nonpublic information, and (iii) our Marketplace Conduct Rules that apply to all trading on our marketplace.

Our market surveillance team looks forward to using Nasdaq‚Äôs Alerts Development Environment and Alerts Management System to become a market leader in custom surveillance rule creation and alerting for the crypto-asset market. We believe that it is this advanced functionality combined with Nasdaq‚Äôs proven, rule-based approach to traditional financial market surveillance that will allow for the most thorough monitoring of the evolving crypto-asset marketplace, today and into the future.

Gemini looks forward to a long and productive relationship with Nasdaq.

"Yesterday: Crap, I hope I didn't make a mistake selling at $9.6k to take some profits if this keeps running up.

Today: Woohoo, I got a chance to buy some more and increase my bags. Let the good times roll again.

May 4th guess: BTC over $10.4k",1524688719
"Please dont take this personally, although it might be sort of offensive to you anyway:    
you said you only own BTC and no Bitcoin Cash.     
that makes me assume that you aquired BTC after the hard fork in August 2017. Otherwise you would either hold both, BTC &amp; BCH or you sold off your BCH.     
BOth cases lead me to the assumption that you are still somewhat unfamiliar with the deeper mechanics of Bitcoin.     
This being said, lets get to the ""full node"" myth, that seems a constant belief in the BTC ocmmunity:    
The only legitimate full nodes are MINERS.     
**Yes - only miners !**    
you can run full nodes all day, as much as you want - they get fed by miners.    
Miners are the initial instance that dictates what is correct on the blockchain and what is not.    
Every ""full node"" that is not a miner will redirect whatever it gets fed by the miners.    
Thats a fact.    
That counts for BTC, as well as for BCH.    
Bitcoin will only be so much decentralized as mining is decentralized.     
Sure, there are some benefitds of running a full node, this can not be denied. but this another story and i will not go into all the details on this.    
Just so much:    
as a sole individual without any business running on Bitcoin, you dont need a full node ever. you will not benefit from it.
",1524688708
"That increase in cost is what makes it no longer cash and at points in history necessary to update the fees on published transactions using RBF - for some using regular credit card transactions through a third party - so that they could get their transactions processed.

The ""hurry"" you soak speak of had been ongoing for years and then came SegWit. Many considered it clumsy and just another step in breaking the design. The manipulation in social media lead to protests, which were met with more sophisticated successful manipulation. There was pressure put on the dissenters to ""fork and let the market decide or shut up"". Once miners and developers were volunteering to do something it was time to do it. Several attempts were made, one successful minority hard fork.

The community had already largely started to use altcoins - many created in response to the issues with BTC - for transactions instead . This subreddit was already created to get around the overly harsh and biased moderation in r/bitcoin etc. If anything, that had already divided the community.",1524688643
"A protocol is literally a shared set of rules, a consensus. A decentralized protocol is one which has no single point of failure. Taking out one or many participants does not disable the protocol.

Decentralization is not a binary property. Its strengths and weaknesses vary by implementation in protocols and hierarchical models - of which bitcoin is definitively not.  Every node and every hash are equal there is no hierarchy just a division of labor.",1524688634
Bitcoin looks weak as shit trying to maintain that 9k,1524688612

"What is your take on the current situation? Massive volume, rather quick climb all week followed by a massive and extremely quick crash. Just another week in crypto? It feels different though. I'd love to hear your opinions!",1524688520
"&gt; Fees have been next nothing for months now and it hasn't stopped people from mining.

That's because of the coinbase rewards. Once those are gone, fees will be the only thing securing the network. The only possible things that secure the network are fees or inflation. Can't have neither.

&gt; if they're holding large amount of Bitcoin

That might be a big ""if"" sometimes

"Hi all,

So I am trading a bit manually for last couple of months, but I would like to combine two interesting activities which are programming and trading.

I am currently playing with Bittrex and with their API and ""getticker"" call I can get current ""Bid"", ""Ask"" and ""Last"" info; example:

Status of BTC-GNT

Bid: 0.00005818

Ask: 0.00005870

Last: 0.00005817

So my questions are... to make my bot as quick &amp; solid as possible:

 ‚Ä¢ What value should I look to buy some of GNT instantly when it reaches 5900? ""Ask""?

 ‚Ä¢ What value should I look to sell that GNT instantly when it reaches 6000? ""Bid""?

 ‚Ä¢ Should I place a order just after buying or should I wait for i.e. ""Bid"" to reach required point?

Thanks in advance! Any more valid conditions to look at beside those 3 values?

This is exactly why I have always respected Charlie Lee. He was transparent about the project and never let his ego get in the way. The Litecoin project is in my opinion the only legitimate child of Bitcoin.

Completely agree. You have segwit on one hand and you have Litecoin on the other which serve different purposes so if it was about a technical perspective he had two really good choices that we're still true to the original nature of Bitcoin. It's just kind of amazing how much effort he's putting into trying to kill the project and pump himself up. The massive Network spam that did make Bitcoin fees go high a few months ago. The burn pile of bcash going on right now. I mean the only argument I can think of for owning bcash is that you just know this guy is eventually going to put his all in it even if it breaks him and pump that coin as high as he possibly can. I just wonder if he realizes that if he did that it's pretty obvious what would happen next.,1524687400

"Yeah no one is surprised. Doesn't mean its ok. If we ever want the casual investor to feel comfortable putting money in crypto, we can't have this stuff",1524687361
"Yes this is possible. I would not personally participate in this type of activity, I'd be 100% against some exchange like coinbase even allowing this.

The allowance of fractional reserve banking will always be abused because humans are greedy - it's their nature. 

For our sake, it should be barred from crypto otherwise we will fall into the same trap as with fiat 

I'd argue that everyone should store their own bitcoin/crypto.

Your point is pretty moot because you're talking about a technology in its infancy (crypto) whereas were talking about a tried and tested technology that always fails (fiat). We've only been operating on a fiat system since 1971. That is a VERY short time historically. Will Crypto eventually die? Sure. But so will the bloody sun. Is that really relevant to our lives? Or is the fiat currency that effects us within our life times (probably sooner than you expect) something worth worrying about?,1524687345
"Any high dollar value of crypto has the same problems. It's never equivalent to the ""cash value"" of that much of whatever coin. Sure, coins might trade at whatever high price, when few coins are being traded. Try to cash out hundreds or thousands of coins at the same time and watch the market take a shit.",1524687329
WOW.... let me guess... they should all kill them selves and shut Bitcoin down so Bitcoin Cash could assume the name Bitcoin and become the dominant $20k coin that rich people want.... except you get rich in the process instead of the Bitcoin people. Sound about right?,1524687320
Because the crypto isn't getting more centralized only the buying point (if this gets adopted bigtime). The crypto itself is actually decentralizing by bringing it to the masses.,1524687289

paired against btc or not doesn't matter the same principles apply to the scenario I am talking about.,1524687236
"&gt; No. In the specific case of Bitcoin, it is not an investment of money, rather, an exchange of legal tender in one form from another - like exchanging dollars for yen.

That is legal nonsense. It doesn't *mean anything*. 

&gt; In this specific case, no. The Howey Test seems to intend that this interpretation of common enterprise to mean a transaction between an individual investor and the vehicle which is generating the token/stock/bond/digital string/whatever. The implication being that this represents some venture in expectation of returns. In the case of Bitcoin, this is nonsensical. There is no Bitcoin, Inc.

There is a Bitcoin foundation. And Nakamoto himself (or themselves) may be the one on the hook. You do not *need* a corporation to commit securities fraud. There is a very, very good argument that Satoshi committed securities fraud with the initial bitcoin ICO. Think about it - why do you need there to be a legitimately formed corporation as a pre-condition to committing securities fraud? Isn't the whole point of fraud that it is based on a series of lies? That is exactly the case here. Just because bitcoin is getting a pass of sorts does not mean, if the *exact same thing* were to happen today, that it may not be shut down. Additionally, large companies that are trying to trade in bitcoin are, in fact, getting shut down by the SEC. The SEC is not in the habit of going after private investors - they are in the habit of going after issuers and institutional investors. If Satoshi Nakamoto were an identified person, you can bet your bottom dollar the SEC would be all over that person. 

&gt; A transaction of dollars to Bitcoin and classifying it as and investment in common enterprise would be no different than holding ownership of a US dollar is a venture in common enterprise based on the success of the US Government and the US economy, just with a smaller economic backing.

WOoooooow that is a load of bullplop. Reading that gives me a migraine. It has nothing to do with reality. However, very briefly, this:

&gt; holding ownership of a US dollar is a venture in common enterprise based on the success of the US Government and the US economy

Is, in a very real sense, *the exact same thing as owning literally any stock in literally any American company.*

&gt; Again, no, any more than a global campaign to get people to trade Pesos for Euros.
It fails the fucking Howey test. Does that mean all cryuptocurrencies will? FUCK NO. They should all be measured and tested against it.

I cannot begin to explain to you how many ways there are to buy exposure to these currencies, in the form of stocks, on the stock market, as registered securities. 

&gt; Just because you've got that law degree, doesn't mean you're smarter than everyone else, just far better educated.

This is an argument *about education* - I am not saying I am smarter than you, I am saying *I know more than you.* I do this for a living. 

Like I said - I am not interested in arguing this, I am not interested in a lay-person opinion of the application of the howie test. [Read the SEC's position. It is here](https://www.bridgingtheweek.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/SEC%20Opposition%20to%20ZASLAVSKIY%20Motion%20to%20Dismiss.pdf). It will, I am sure, be ruled correct. Actually *read it* - they explain how the howie test actually *works* - not a lay person's idea of it. The way it has been interpreted by the federal courts over decades. Your intuitive reasoning (while admittedly very intuitive indeed) just has nothing to do with the way the law actually works. 

In the meantime, I've set the reminder. In a year, I feel fairly certain that we will see that it has become eminently, elaborately clear that cryptocurrency is, in the vast majority of instances, a security. ",1524687222
"Another problem is that (here in Australia at least but I'm sure it's the same elsewhere) the tax office classes crypto as an asset, which is subject to capital gains taxes.

So if I buy a coffee with BTC, I've created a taxable event and am legally supposed to report any gain/loss I've made.

Crypto will never get adopted as currency as long as that's the case.",1524687200
"Not at all what I'm talking about.

&gt; so we can correct them.

This is what I'm talking about. With bitcoin you have a willingness to see things the other way, to make an attempt to better it, etc. When it comes to something other than bitcoin, your reaction is ""scam"" , ""scammer"", etc.

Take Roger Ver as one example. Everything negative you can possibly find about him you blast in people's faces. You paint him as terrible as you possibly can. However, if you were really ""extremely biased towards the facts"", you _might_ also point out stuff like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89o171/im_mark_karpel%C3%A8s_exceo_of_bankrupt_mtgox_ask_me/dws9z1r/), rather than just giving people the negative video where he says Mt. Gox is fine. You are biased towards bitcoin and you mold everything else to that bias. You are not as intellectually honest as you pretend to be.",1524687188
"Fees have been next nothing for months now and it hasn't stopped people from mining. Also, I'd think that securing the network is in every miner's interest if they're holding large amount of Bitcoin. The flipside is they stop mining, the system is attacked, and their Bitcoin plummets in value.

Assuming Bitcoin ever reaches critical mass, the reason to mine it would be for the sake of your own money and investment. Mining becomes like insurance.",1524687184
"needs more lambos. bitcoin is the future and not physical, its digital. on paper or even a memory card. ",1524687161
"The reason there aren't any Bitcoin Cash (BCH) fee prediction sites is because the mem pool for BCH clears on almost every block. A 1 sat/B transaction is almost guaranteed to get in the next block, even more by 2 blocks, and within six, there's virtually no chance it will have been left behind. I bumped up this value by an additional 20% just to give an unnecessary safety margin to these values.",1524687129
"Ah! They are averaging transaction costs. Which seems valid, but again it is an average. Some people might want to pay a high premium to get there transaction in faster and some transactions have lots of inputs that makes them much more expensive than average. Median values would be more useful than averages.

In my case the $1.3 USD cost per Kb comes from looking up my transaction in a block explorer. The fee rate for **my transaction** was 0.0001509473684210526 BTC per kB \($1.13 USD\)",1524687115
The key is that Bitcoin is limited in supply. Fiat is not limited.,1524687111

"You are incredibly misinformed.  I teach trading, and I've been trading way before crypto was created.  I first bought BTC in 2012, and have been trading it since.  

You might understand how TA works as a tool, but you do not understand how to use that tool.  

TA works BETTER in the crypto-market than in traditional markets.  In traditional markets, your company of choice has taxes, quarterly reports, and a plethora of other solid facts.  In crypto, its pretty much all speculative.  You can estimate how much a stock SHOULD be worth when you know the revenue/expenses of a company in a certain time frame.  In crypto, there's none of that.  Yes, there's a team, there's prior experience, partnerships, etc, but that is not rock solid numbers.  Its all emotions and sentiment in the market.  

TA is not emotion.  TA is how to profit off emotion.  Emotion is crying on the sub to HODL when your portfolio has one red day.  

&gt; Crypto in particular makes it even less effective since the market moves are driven almost entirely by large manipulating groups.

If you think manipulation and whales are *hurting* traders, then you do not anything about trading.  All trades are open for everyone to see.  If you don't know how to swim WITH the whales, then you get run over.  There have been NUMEROUS guides on how to trade and swim with the whales, but most of the ""TA IS FAKE JUST HODL"" people aren't open minded enough to actually read and learn.  They dwell in their own ignorance to accept another viewpoint.  Information, especially in crypto, is never bad. 

I have written guides on this sub.  I even have 3 pages of PM's that I'm still trying to reply to to help a few people that had questions.",1524686920

I'm not talking about lightning or anything in particular, I have no idea what the best long term solution is, it might even be bigger blocks.

"No masternodes are not the same as validators.... validators are more like PoS miners than anything but use Ripples consensus algorithm. Masternodes are nodes full of crypto that are used for things like coinjoin, instant pay and governance. Like I've mentioned before you need to do more research.

&gt;Attach whatever Orwellian name you want, it will still be a masternode. Node system completely centralized,

Mentioning Orwell doesn't make your point more valid it just shows your clutching at straws, I doubt you've even read 1984 your just trying to sound profound.

Fee in satoshis per byte and coinage is what prevents 'spam'. Consider that bitcoin does not not any 'spam prevention' to increase the max blocksize. The only thing that matters is that nodes are expecting and able to handle blocks as large as the max. 
Satoshi implemented the blocksize max and he called it a DoS prevention measure. It was never about Spam.

"Secret splitting is good, but there's a far better way with hardware wallets. It's advised to use a passphrase in addition to the seed, so that even a malicious party discovering your seed cannot do anything constructive with it.

This entirely avoids having to protect the seed in a paranoid way, or worry about losing more than one of three backups.

Oh, and you can use as many passphrases as you want, and they are plausibly deniable, since they are deterministic, and any imaginable passphrase is valid. A wallet with a passphrased compartment and a wallet without one look identical on the surface. Have 10 passphrases and 10 entire hidden wallets inside your seed, if you want.

Think about the power of that setup: even if your government learns your seed by force, and wants to confiscate your money; even if someone holds you at gunpoint and demands you empty your hardware wallet for them; even if they say ""empty the hidden compartment, too, asshole, I know everybody's got one""; with such a setup, you can appear to oblige, surviving these nightmare scenarios without losing even a quarter of your total crypto.",1524686404

"&gt; Most recent exemple? https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8eubao/the_largest_exchange_in_india_is_pushing_bch_hard/ That exchange is not even close to being the largest exchange in India.

agreed, read the thread, searched for ""bitxoxo volume"" could not find it, not listed on coinmarketcap, any comment u/MemoryDealers ?


&gt; This tweet, for obvious reasons: https://twitter.com/rogerkver/status/981908565307764736


agreed Bitcoin Cash is not Bitcoin (Bitcoin Core is Bitcoin ""**currently**"") , ruleset defined by Greatest Proof of Work 


though admittedly my biases lean me toward option 3, as I can imagine a time when Bitcoin Cash with mass adoption overtakes the PoW of the current Bitcoin, if it doesn't manage to scale.


or Worse some other coin comes out of nowhere and dominates, then nobody cares which Bitcoin is Bitcoin, 


&gt; People has lost money over this. One example:


https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/10/16873090/bitcoin-bitcoin-cash-overstock-payment-glitch-cryptocurrency


agreed, though oversights happen, and people can pay dearly for them, overstock got of light. 


I believe user experience (for want of a better term) is continually being improved by highly motivated entities eg Bitpay's implementation of [Cashadress](https://support.bitpay.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004671663-BitPay-s-Adopted-Conventions-for-Bitcoin-Cash-Addresses-URIs-and-Payment-Requests) and [Bip70](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/836m0q/bip70_either_bitpay_get_rid_of_it_or_all_bch/) though admittedly I am not wholly familiar with either.


and of course people sending BCH to Segwit Addresses I am not sure if any have been recovered.


I believe these last points are short term and it's just a matter of time for the wrinkles in new address formats etc are ironed out.

"Tom who?

You'd have a higher chance getting a few bucks investing in BCH at current valuation, before Friday, than you would investing in BTC. ",1524686306
"Someone did this yesterday with Bitcoin for his 2 year old son and posted it. So, the novelty has kind of worn off.  

Why Doge? Or was this supposed to be satire? I don't know. Go crypto!!!",1524686300
"Cryptos big selling point is decentralized, deregulated currency. It's highly volatile, losing nearly 50% of its total value in a month proves this. It's not a ""tested"" market, you don't have decades of data to shovel through, it'll be hard to write algorithms etc. There's a ton of issues, red flags and volatility that will keep the real money out, money that would propel any crypto well over hundreds of thousands per coin. Beating inflation is easy, near brain dead easy especially if you diversify. Just slapping your stocks in any major index does that year over year almost every year, roughly a 6-8% gain. Inflation is 1/3 of that max. The top stock gurus pull a ~30% gain year over year.   

Did I call crypto a sham? Where exactly? I said it's main selling point was unregulated, decentralized currency, which shoving it on any stock index would utterly destroy it's core selling point, making it an extremely shitty investment. It's like taking the engine and transmission out of a new car and trying to get full price for it.",1524686204

"For anyone wondering why the volume is so high right now, as we bounce around $9k... it's because we're pretty much fractured down the middle...

Half the people think BTC is going to 6k, bought in at 8k but didn't REALLY believe and are now ""selling for profit""

Half the people think BTC is going to 10k and past.


So ask yourself what happens when this volume picks up....

The sellers are selling. And they are selling to people buying. 

The people buying believe it's going up. So every second that passes by, BTC is being passed from skeptical hands to sure-hands.

Eventually, everyone who wants off the bus gets off the bus. Everyone on the bus isn't willing to give up their seat.

Guess where the bus goes now? And it's loaded up with believers.


THAT RIGHT THERE is why this volume is a positive sign. And if people say that ""there are buyers and sellers"" in this volume, they are RIGHT. But more importantly they are WRONG. Because their meaning is that the volume doesn't matter.

BUT IT DOES MATTER.

Because the BTC is being transferred from nonbelievers to believers who won't sell.",1524686067

"I'm not sure about that. If crypto acquires massive adaption, and can be used as a currency, then why would I convert it back into fiat? Lets say I bought Nano at $10. 5 years from now, lets say Nano is worth $100, BUT I can actually use Nano as a consumer, just like fiat. Why would I convert it back to fiat, when there's a tax involved in the conversion? ",1524685660

However...


Counting the dollar value of fees is misleading. If the prices were reversed (which is a goal of many people in this sub) the difference would be waaaay less. For example, if BTC was $1k vs BCH @ $10k the feels would be $0.2 Vs $0.03

Your asking about vendor integration of Bitcoin, but why not ask about integration of all Cryptocurrency in general. This is not a problem specific to Bitcoin, when virtually all of Cryptocurrency sees very little adoption, and is mostly a tool for speculation. 

""And here we can see that the whole point of the thing was to avoid centralized authorities.
So, let's solve the cash problem with a solution that has a catchy name, right? How bout Lightning Network, sounds good? Too bad it's all about centralizing the whole thing by subjecting it to the addition of a bunch of tiny cancerous parasites that each act just like a classical bank would.""

Interesting thing about the original Satoshi whitepaper, descentralization is never mentioned once! Descentralization seems to have been a complimentary concept to Bitcoin.

"Dorian is known to have been a mistake. He just happened to be born named Satoshi nakamoto and when the first reporter asked him about Bitcoin he got confused about some work he did with a bank but in reality he knew nothing about Bitcoin or blockchain

The piece that troubles me about the Hal Finney theory is that we have full records of his conversations with Satoshi. Forum posts and emails. He was participating and trying to help at that time. To me, someone at the onset of ALS wouldn't have done such a good job or even put that much effort into faking emails back and forth from Satoshi and pretending to be two ppl at the same time in forums.

The only valid point I see about Hal Finney being Satoshi is that Satoshi disappeared around the same time Finney's ALS started getting worse and it's understandable why people would make the connection.

Personally I think it's just a single coincidence bc there are way more facts that point at Szabo. There are other people who argue that it couldn't have been a single person. Szabo wrote bit gold, he is probably one of the few people who could have improved the few things to make it into Bitcoin. He also is the person who created the idea of smart contracts. Bit Gold -&gt; Bitcoin(?) -&gt; Smart Contracts. He definitely has the proper qualifications to have done it.

I guess in the end we can't know for sure until the truth comes out, we can only make our own conclusions based on the facts. Personally after looking into it a lot, my opinion stands that if it doesn't turn out to be Szabo I'd be extremely surprised",1524685473

"Um... if you can be kicked out, it's literally not decentralized, since a decentralized system is bottom-up, so all the different rules combined are what make the system a system, not some all or nothing contest of wills.

A decentralized system is one where everyone gets to do what they want.  And no one else can order them around.  A centralized system is one where control is... well... centralized, as in one rule for everyone.  That rule comes from some smaller subset of the group, which is the center.  In Bitcoin that's ""Satoshi"", plus the developers, mostly.  With a bit of ""voting"" by the miners, nodes, and users in a hierarchical way.

If there is no hierarchy, no shared rules, then it's decentralized.

Art, for example, is a decentralized system.  Any artist can make anything they want, in any way they want.  And the styles that emerge out of the collective group of ""artists"" becomes the system.  But no artist can tell any other artist what they have to do to make art, nor can any artist kick any other artist out of the system of artists.  There is no hierarchy.  (Note we're not talking about craft and education and selling art, just the making of art.)",1524685438

- There are planned every 6 months to upgrade many things in a clean and predictable way. Not just block size.

- It's good idea to build the infrastructure before it's needed, so that it can accommodate all the volume that can suddenly come one day without warning, like in December, and to make room for the apps that people can now confidently plan to make because there's room for them in the chain. (ETH could have been part of Bitcoin if not for the crippling of several things like OP_RETURN).

- Next fork also restores multiple OP codes that will enable more complex apps to be deployed, and will enable for example to memo.cash to rise the character limit in messages from 75 to 225 bytes.

Also the idea is eventually remove the the blocksize limit completely and let the miners choose their own limit. But i think that wont happen on the November fork either. Maybe next year.

"so let me recap:  
you first started by pushing the meme of how many lightning users compared to bch and I point out why that's a silly analogy and you ignored.  
  
Then you moved on to the blockchain size cap meme and I pointed out why that's a bad attack vector due to math and you changed topic again.  
  
then you change it to the devs being bad and I point out that bch devs haven't done anything but change one variable (which you ignored) and it's the original btc devs that really did all the work...  
  
Then you state that bitcoin doesn't need fixing which doesn't make sense because bitcoin cash would not have forked it ""they"" believed btc didn't need to be fixed. Technically, btc never changed. It's stayed the path it was always on and bch is the one who wanted to adapt to larger block sizes and therefore forked. BTC said they wanted stability and bch said that wanted to adapt and both have valid points, I'll grant you that... but it's false to say btc changed and bch stayed the same. Technically, it didn't even exist. The best you can say is bch wanted to stay true to the original proposals and whitepaper of adapting and this is a valid point if you really believe that this is a current limitation. It's the norm for any (maybe every) successful company to adapt from it's initial focus to adapt into it's current environment so I don't agree that by btc stating they don't want to enlargen the blocksize due to the problems that it can bring is saying that they aren't the true bitcoin. Of course it is. It's a purely false statement to say anything otherwise.  I'm under the opinion that it should have always been a variable number that adapts with the current need and this shouldn't be hard to code which is better than both solutions but what can I say.  I'm not one of the devs and both sides have valid arguments.    
  
Can you stop talking with bs talking point memes and critically think it through and have a real conversation and not just spout terms and 1 liners. I actually like the coin itself. I like both coins as a matter of fact and I own both coins. It's the crowds that are the real problem along with Roger Ver . The lying and toxicity is problematic not just to bch but to the entire crypto community and to the world beyond crypto because it hurts adoption and causes confusion and animosity where there doesn't need to be any. you don't see me going ""best of luck with your bet on Lightning!"" which is a snide remark because you can't rebut any of my statements.

I think all currencies have value, it just 'leaks out' of ordinary fiat, its not nothing, but its not forever, either. I almost see Fiat as a drunk father playing Russian Roulette, and Crypto as a child playing with pretend money, and thinking their scribbles could be real money. As long as daddy doesn't actually blow his own brains out, everything stays the same, but if Capitalism and the Financial System break themselves, then little Timmies play money might just be reality, not because its worth more, but because daddie's gone, and something else is needed to keep the country going. Crypto alone isn't breaking anything, but 2008's happen, and many people, including myself, think it could happen again, and not be fixable by massive Fiat printing next time. So maybe Timmy should have that play money ready, cause daddy looks really drunk now, waving that gun around...",1524684495

It is entirely separate, and any attempt to associate the two is an attempt to deceive those who aren't able to determine the difference for themselves. Bitcoin is Bitcoin.

"&gt;So according to your chart Bitcoin is 3rd overall in confirmed transactions. How is this a counter to what I said, BTC is easily one of the most used cryptos?

It's one of the most used cryptos, yes, but it's far from being THE most used, and it couldn't even get close to XRP's transaction number without experiencing some severe technical difficulties. 

&gt;Also how are you determining that Bitcoin is dead, and has been for a  long time? I find this statement the most puzzling of all as Bitcoin  easily has the greatest trading volume of any Crypto. If people are  massively trading it, then how is it dead? 

Trading volume doesn't mean shit when you HAVE to go through BTC on 80&amp;#37; of exchanges because there's no other pairs. It will sharply decrease once fiat pairings have arrived on the biggest exchanges.

And bitcoin isn't dead because it's traded or not, it's dead because it cannot and will not complete its objectives. It has already failed and there is no redemption to be found. 

&gt;Also what about Sathoshi's whitepaper do you feel has nothing in common with Bitcoin in 2018 

Hmm, let's see...

&gt; Bitcoin: A Peer\-to\-Peer Electronic Cash System 

Oh, yes. The title. ""Cash system"". As far as I know the core fanboys call it a ""store of value"" now. So much for the cash thing. 

I guess that with Roger Ver's bullshit clone, they wouldn't want for anyone to make a mistake. Right? 

&gt; 1. Introduction  
&gt;  
&gt;Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third  parties  to process electronic payments.   While the  system works  well enough for most   transactions,   it   still   suffers   from   the   inherent   weaknesses   of   the   trust   based   model

Oh dang, it was really meant to be used as currency though, it doesn't just say that in the title.

How's the ebay integration going so far? Nope? Amazon ? Craigslist ... ? Nah, it's nowhere to be seen. I guess that the 50$ fees and 3 days waiting times have scared away a lot of people, huh? 

&gt; The problem of course is the payee can't verify that one of the owners did not double\-spend the coin.  A common solution is to introduce a trusted central authority, or mint, that checks every transaction for double spending.  After each transaction, the coin must be returned to the mint to issue a new coin, and only coins issued directly from the mint are trusted not to be double\-spent. The   problem   with   this   solution   is   that   the   fate   of   the   entire   money   system   depends   on   the company running the mint, with every transaction having to go through them, just like a bank.

And here we can see that the whole point of the thing was to avoid centralized authorities. 

So, let's solve the cash problem with a solution that has a catchy name, right? How bout Lightning Network, sounds good? Too bad it's all about centralizing the whole thing by subjecting it to the addition of a bunch of tiny cancerous parasites that each act just like a classical bank would. 

This is why I consider Bitcoin to be a dead coin walking. It only exists today by virtue of being the first, the one that launched the whole ecosystem. And because some people are very emotional about it. But there's absolutely NO reason to use Bitcoin today, everything it set out to do is done better by other coins. NANO for being a currency that's blazing fast and feeless, Monero for being a true replacement of fiat as far as anonymity goes. Among others. 

Then again, it wouldn't be too bad if Bitcoin actually could be reformed so as to get better in one way or the other, but it can't. The changes required are far too substantial, and all of the proposed solutions so far involve abandoning one aspect in favor of the other \(the LN sacrifices decentralization for speed, for example\).

I mean, that's how currency speculation works.  Technically, it's how nearly any investment vehicle works: you put money in, and hope for more money out.  You can't pay for a cheeseburger with a share of Amazon, though.  It's what separates it as a currency, over a security.

"**Dunning‚ÄìKruger effect**

In the field of psychology, the Dunning‚ÄìKruger effect is a cognitive bias wherein people of low ability have illusory superiority, mistakenly assessing their cognitive ability as greater than it is. The cognitive bias of illusory superiority derives from the metacognitive inability of low-ability persons to recognize their own ineptitude; without the self-awareness of metacognition, low-ability people cannot objectively evaluate their actual competence or incompetence.

Conversely, highly competent individuals may erroneously assume that tasks easy for them to perform are also easy for other people to perform, or that other people will have a similar understanding of subjects that they themselves are well-versed in.

"&gt; 1.It is an investment of money

No.  In the specific case of Bitcoin, it is not an investment of money, rather, an exchange of legal tender in one form from another - like exchanging dollars for yen.

&gt; 2.There is an expectation of profits from the investment

 Possibly, in the same way that trading dollars for yen on a foreign currency exchange is expected to return profits.  I am assuming the concept of Japanese legal tender does not fall under classification as a 'security'.
 
&gt; 3.The investment of money is in a common enterprise

In this specific case, no.  The Howey Test seems to intend that this interpretation of common enterprise to mean a transaction between an individual investor and the vehicle which is generating the token/stock/bond/digital string/whatever.  The implication being that this represents some venture in expectation of returns.  In the case of Bitcoin, this is nonsensical.  There is no Bitcoin, Inc.  In US V.

A transaction of dollars to Bitcoin and classifying it as and investment in common enterprise would be no different than holding ownership of a US dollar is a venture in common enterprise based on the success of the US Government and the US economy, just with a smaller economic backing.
 
&gt; 4.Any profit comes from the efforts of a promoter or third party

Again, no, any more than a global campaign to get people to trade Pesos for Euros.  Your previous case example had the investment seller offering REcoins, but these were for all intents and purposes just stocks, rebranded, and so very clearly were securities.  So, tell me, what is the investment a Bitcoin represents, as a vehicle?  It's not a guarantee on any form of annuity or interest.  It's not a share in ownership of anything.  It doesn't represent a lien, title, deed, or certificate in ownership of *anything*, any more than a dollar is a deed for anything.

It fails the fucking Howey test.  Does that mean *all* cryuptocurrencies will?  FUCK NO.  They should all be measured and tested against it.

When it's convenient for you, you blow them off using the ""bitcoin only"" rule. When it's an easy chance to get a dig at alt coins, and promote your investment (BTC), you gladly do it.

Look at EULA's. No one reads them, and not everyone is a lawyer or has enough law knowledge to understand them.  And just because the user ""accepts it"", it doesn't mean that it is legally binding.

work all at once with little coordination. They do not need to be identified, since messages are
not routed to any particular place and only need to be delivered on a best effort basis. Nodes can
leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the proof-of-work chain as proof of what
happened while they were gone. They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of
valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on
them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.""

No

Almost. The bitcoin network itself will do the confirmation. You can look up the address you've given out on a block chain explorer and see the latest payments that have gone to it. The ledger app will spot any payments once you reconnect everything but bitcoin will continue to work regardless of you being around to see it.

Be aware the ledger may empty the address you give out if you spend from it. Don't be alarmed, this is normal and anyone with the address will still be able to send you bitcoin. You'll always get a new receiving address every time you ask for one as well if the old one has been used. Again, normal. 

If you chose to manage your ledger with the electrum wallet (be sure not to download a malicious version) then electrum can export a **public** key. You can scan this into the 'Sentinel' app on android and keep a tab on things on your phone. You can even issue new receiving addresses with this.

* Some genuine BCH fans who have developed an obsession with 8MB will keep mining the old chain (unlikely)

* Pump and dumpers will take any feasible opportunity to split a major coin in the hopes of manipulating the price of the mini-coin to their advantage. (Quite possible)

* Core supporters will take the opportunity to simultaneously undermine the validity of BCH, while also reinforcing their argument that hardforks are always contentious. (Very very likely and probably the same reason ETC exists).

The more rapidly adjusting difficulty algorithm means that the vestigial fork of BCH will be much easier to keep alive than a BTC fork, and the group of people most likely to try to keep the old chain alive are bitcoiners, they already have sha256 mining equipment. They have old ASICs that can‚Äôt mine BTC profitably anymore. Turning those on and burning electricity for a week or two just to fuck with BCH is so ridiculously easy.

So all this marketing crap about rebranding hardforks as ‚Äúupgrades‚Äù is pointless. The only thing it‚Äôs likely to achieve is causing some poorly informed people to not bother ‚Äúupgrading‚Äù on time and ending up on the split chain that is almost certainly going to be there.",1524680708

"Here are a few ways I see crypto really having an impact.

1. I process large but infrequent credit card transactions form my customers. I pay 2.9% fee for that luxery regardless of the amount. I processed a $10,000 payment last week and paid $290 to the processing company for that ability. I also was charged another 2% to convert that from USD to CAD. I also had to wait 5 business days for that to clear to my bank account to become usable. Most small to medium-sized businesses are paying 2-3% to process all those credit card transactions. That either gets eaten by the business owner or rolled into the price. The latter is more likely and the consumer pays for it hidden in the price. Yes, crypto costs a bit to transfer but not 2-3%.

2. I deposit international (and local) cheques all the time. The bank fronts me $2500 and freezes any amount over that until it clears in 3-5 days. This is their workaround for making you feel like it is instant. However, how many times have these cheques bounced? How many people on craigslist get caught up in this type of cheque scam? Crypto is fast and the funds are available immediately.

3. I needed to send some money to my sister in the UK. I sent it via western union and it cost me an arm and a leg to do it. The fee to send, the conversion rate etc are ridiculous.

4. I travelled around South East Asia for a month and everywhere I went, requires cash. I was not going to carry much cash on me at any given time, so I had to withdraw smaller amounts frequently and paying a ton in fees and conversion to do so.

5. My tenants pay me their rent monthly. However, due to their daily limit (that their bank won't increase), they have to send it in two amounts over two days. This takes extra time and costs extra in the transfer fees.

I would also like to add, banks aren't going anywhere, even if we fully adopt crypto. People will still need to store their crypto in an insured bank, take out mortgages and loans, and invest in other traditional vehicles.",1524680660

"&gt;Lol, I‚Äôd rather let the technology speak for itself

What? Big blocks?? LMAO. Come one, let's be serious.

&gt;The scaling debate had been an issue brought up years prior to hitting the ceiling and was ignored by Blockstream.. I guess you most certainly were not in any kind of rush last year, nor this year with the current development.

Was never ignored, it was simply recognized that big blocks were not the answer. They still aren't. And not because I say so, but because any reasonable assessment of the (on-chain) scaling requirements shows you it's not feasible. Well, not feasible if you want a decentralized money. Giant miners and server farms are NOT decentralized. That is SO easy to take over by something like a big international agreement. 

&gt;You mean to tell me the great SN was smart enough to foresee the majority of the more complex issues with BTC to this day, but SN wasn‚Äôt smart enough to foresee the day that the system they built would hit the coin distribution ceiling?

That's exactly right. He never hinted at ""bitcoin instability in the absence of block reward"", he only said that fees would replace the block reward. But he did not foresee how miners could game permanently ""empty"" blocks. This was genuine research published way later, which concludes that you basically have two ways out - (a) the emergence of a fee market or (b) a perpetual coin reward. Pick your poison.

I'll assume you didn't read the paper I'm referring to. You should, would give you a very different perspective on things. And that scenario is not so far in the future... one or two halvenings away. When the block reward is 3.125 BTC, if Bitcoin's value is not ~$1M, it'll be questionable how to sustain the mining. (Mining cost today is ~$8k/coin...) Read the paper.

&gt;This is 100% avoidable if the applications built on top of the protocol are bounded by the foundations of said protocol that do not allow such clusterfuck coding.

You never coded, did you? This sounds like typical ""consultant babble"", much like ""we must leverage"", or ""to take advantage of this/that we must [blah, blah, blah]"". The truth is that 

Turing completeness = Great power = Can of ~~worms~~ bugs.

If what you say was true, code would have no bugs. Yet even the best coders make mistakes all the time. (Not necessarily the best, but I'll remind you of the ""off-by-1"" bug Jeff Garzik managed to squeeze into the S2X code last year....)

As I said, you can keep all that on BCH, for Bitcoin I don't want any of that. But welcome it on RSK, where a bug will not break Bitcoin in any way. (Btw, I note you didn't really take the time to reply to my remarks about RSK... so Bitcoin already has Turing completeness and smart contracts TODAY, on the RSK sidechain. BCH is late to this party.)

&gt;Meaning, Bitcoin is much-much more than just a currency.

Indeed... via sidechains. Not on the main chain.


&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Yet you took the time to reply to everything else, except for what one may argue the meat and potatoes of the original comment.

OK... for the 1 millionth time:

&gt;Let me guess.. limit the potential of layer 1, 

L1 has inherent limits. It is slow, limited and works as a ""broadcast"". This is not efficient at all. In fact, a blockchain is nothing but a ""slow and inefficient database"". (But it can be made useful by being distributed using PoW.) So no, no one limited the potential of L1.

&gt;create a layer 2 to undermine layer 1, 

There is no undermining. If you are referring to ""fees taken from miners"", they will have plenty of fees to collect. I'll remind you that not long ago Greg was pooping champagne. Now I know you think he was doing that to please his AXA/Bilderberg masters, but the reality is that he did that because the block reward essentially doubled to ~25BTC for a few blocks. If miners could collect ~15.5 BTC when the block reward will be ~3.125 BTC, they will be MIGHTY happy to mine BTC. 

No undermining.

&gt;through the use routing that is more complex than unsolved BGP routing, 

True, routing is not a solved issue, but it doesn't have to be fully solved to work properly. And the creation of ""channel factories"" will simplify the problem significantly. Deny it as much as you will, but we do have a working prototype of the LN **today**, with all the problems you imagine. It exists, and it works.


&gt;then move the majority of the very mining fees that create economic incentive to secure the network to that layer 2 

Which majority of fees??? Not too sure what yo're talking about. Opening and closing channels will pay fees, and with more people using it, there will be plenty of fees to collect. Remember 1MB blocks? High fees...

&gt;in the form of hub-and-spoke, 

This is a total misrepresentation, and is intentionally deceiving. There will likely be a hub-and-spoke topology, because it makes everything more efficient. But that's not the point... the point is the I CAN OPEN A CHANNEL AWAY FROM ANY BIG HUB, if I want to. That's the fundamental difference of a permissionless system, I can use ""established"" routes, OR I can set up my own. This second part is the key difference with today's banking system, where you CANNOT sidestep it. 

So even assuming what you like to push, that big hubs will need AML/KYC, which is not at all guaranteed and there are now people lobbying that doesn't make much sense because they have no control of the money, I can completely sidestep those hubs by opening direct channels with whoever I want. And because a LN node is dirt cheap, thanks to small blocks!, running mini-hubs will be extremely popular. Low barrier to entry = great competition. (Guess how much competition will server farms have?)


&gt;effectively creating the federal reserve 2.0.

LMAO. This is the best.. the best for last huh? When you lock up Bitcoin in a channel there is no IOU floating around, nor can you create money out of thin air. The way this works is literally like putting money in a pot and then agreeing how we're going to split that money. So no federal reserve with LN. 

If I look at server farms + giant mining operations, on the other hand... how are you, with your mighty SPV, going to prevent miners from increasing the monetary supply? How are you going to stop them? There's what, 2, 3 miners for BCH today? Let's say you get some more... 10. Do you think they will not collude to do somthing that **benefits all of them**, like increasing the block reward whenever it suits them? You certainly won't be able to stop them. So basically you'll have a cartel that will do what is best for its members. If that doesn't sound like Banking 2.0 to you, you are blind, or intentionally blinding yourself.

"You are thinking about it all wrong.

Blockchain isn't some kind of magical new technology, it's a few cryptography primitives thrown together in order to have an append-only publicly-distributed database.

And the reason that nobody else tossed those primitives together isn't Satoshi Nakamoto being a genius. (They're not, but this thread is not the place to talk about that)

_It's that nobody needed an append-only publicly-distributed database._

DHTs had already existed for years. _And people do not need decentralization_. Centralized control exists for a good reason: _It makes errors far easier and simpler to fix_. (And no, decentralization is not cheaper. You can't get rid of the trusted middleman, remove the payment provider and dispute settlement is simply moved into an escrow service)

The actual value proposition for Blockchains is absurdly overstated, mostly by startup teams who wanted to peddle investors out of some money selling hot air. (See also: Almost every ICO.)


Which brings us to the part that is going to get be flak in this subreddit:

_Cryptocurrencies, as they currently exist, are a complete and utter crapshoot at anything besides peddling a libertarian pipe dream._

People in the cryptocurrency community have these grandiose dreams of a deflationary economy, powered by commodity currencies that cannot be inflated by those damn evil central banks.

The main problem with that dream being: humanity already had them. _For millenia._ Humanity switched to fiat currencies _because commodity ones were shit._

It's not just ""the lack of solutions to the main technical problems of Bitcoin in particular."" that people are annoyed at.

People are annoyed at the fact that the cryptocurrency community _pretty much ignores all economic problems with current cryptocurrencies_.

And there is no interest in fixing these economic problems; Introducing something like long term inflation would pretty much guarantee that the cryptocurrency bubble is going to collapse. Which none of the speculators want to happen.

&gt; To me, they just seem tired of the hype train

This is pretty much the crux of the matter, to continue the train metaphor:

Buttcoiners are those that were on the cryptocurrency train, noticed that one of the traincars was on fire, and when they proposed that the car be extinguished the other occupants of the train shouted them down as idiots because ""look at our train getting attention from those besides the rails!"".

The Bitcoin Core software is a combination Node and Wallet, and *can* also mine, but standard hardware (CPU &amp; GPU) is not cost effective energy wise to mine with. You could connect ASICs to the node and mine, if you wanted. I just use the node &amp; wallet. The Node function contains the ledger and can validate transactions (particularly my incoming transactions without deferring to some other node I don't control). The node also propagates valid blocks to other listening nodes, and provides the entire ledger contents to other nodes catching up with the state of the network. There is no reward  for running a node unless you mine, then you can get block rewards and collect transaction fees. The only incentive for running a non mining node is helping the network, participating in the consensus process and validating your own transactions.

But... I'm going to tease out of that the theory that you have that it's about having a large number of individuals who are participating in the system.  But that seems to be ignoring the fact that any large system has many members.  The US government has many millions of voters, but it's obviously centralized.  The rules are the same for everyone in the US.  The control is in the center (aka., top-down as a hierarchy).  Members can vote, but they aren't able to do what they want.  The central system is where the control is and it moves out to the individuals.  Just like Bitcoin.  Just like the national banking system.  Those at the top get to make the decisions for the most part, and those decisions apply to everyone, or they will be booted out of the system.

In a decentralized system, as systems theory and complexity theory and evolutionary theory all define the concept, control is bottom-up, with everyone making their own decisions, using their own rules, and having emergent behavior in the system as a whole appear unexpectedly and unintentionally.

If you can be kicked out of a system by some (central) authority or rule, then it's a centralized system.  At least if we're talking governance/rules.

Bitcoin is decentralized in it's labor, of course, since anyone who has the resources can mine or run a node or trade Bitcoin.  But the rules are clearly centralized, since, as you say, they can kick you out of the system if you don't obey the central authority of the rules.",1524678450

"It's not DOOMED.  That's a bit gloomy.  It's just that nobody has ever really done this before.  The closest we get was back in the Medieval era with the introduction of guild bank notes as an alternative to paper money, and that's stretching it there a bit.

Bitcoins aren't valuable inherently on their own: they're a *medium FOR value*, like any other currency.  This actually makes Bitcoin really exciting, for completely non-tech reasons.

Blockchain is neato, but it's a mint.  That's all it is.  It is a mint, that makes Bitcoins.  Blockchain does its best to prevent forgery of the currency it makes by having really hard to crack security (like microprint, rag content, reactive ink, and other security measures paper and coin money does).  Let's never talk about the blockchain again, because we've already covered everything that's important about it.

Anywho, why this is exciting.  So, the values of money is, at it's core, are based on what everyone basically agrees the economy of the place that prints it is worth, divided by amount of that money in circulation, and then everyone compares it to competiting economies divided by *their* money.  Take the GDP and estimated growth values of the US, divide it up for each piece dollar, and that's what a dollar is worth: that fraction of the US economy.  Same goes for euros.  You compare values of money by comparing *this* fraction of *this* economy against *that* fraction of *that* economy and come up with an exchange rate.

That's incredibly oversimplified, but it's the gist of it.  Well, Bitcoin is de-centralized, which creates this new problem: What economy do I measure up and then divide into fractions to get the value of Bitcoin?

Well, since it's de-centralized, it (theoretically) touches upon all economies that agree to use it equally - because the only mint that makes the damn things isn't beholden to a government or a single economy, it's just the combined value of all governments, enterprises, businesses, etc. that are willing to do business with Bitcoins as a means of paying off debts (both public and private).

That's a lot, in theory.  In practice, it's just the value of goods and services you can get with companies that take Bitcoin.  It's not much, but you'll see demand and liquidity *skyrocket* the first time any country lets you pay your taxes with them.

Now, there aren't a whole lot of Bitcoins in circulation right now, when compared to other currencies.  The fraction of the pie is a WHOLE LOT bigger, even if the sum total of the pie is smaller.  So, right now, individual Bitcoins *should* be worth quite a bit, with a limited market.  Doing business with whole Bitcoins is kind of like ordering off the value menu and paying with $10,000 bills, so fractionalization is a big deal.  And, since there's a finite ultimate supply, it's going to be rock-solid stable.

And with the backing of the entire global market (eventually), I can see it becoming the new universal standard if it just survives all the tards treating it like stock or pork-bellies.",1524677148

"Fill me in if Im off the Mark here, but there is no reason fractional reserve banking doesn't work in crypto.

Let's say you have a money custodian, coinbase for the sake of example. Coinbase agrees to give you back your Bitcoin when asked (just like a bank). However, since they have a significant amount of Bitcoin, they can reasonably assume that not everyone will request it all back at once. Really they only need to hold onto a fraction of that amount in Bitcoin and the rest they can lend out. By lending out your Bitcoin they can get paid in interest on loans they make, and can even off you an interest rate on your Bitcoin.

Let's say me and 20 others each have 1 Bitcoin and I give it to coinbase to hold on to, and that is the entire Bitcoin money supply. Right then you have a total of 21 Bitcoin. You want Bitcoin as a part of a loan, so you go to coinbase and ask for 5 Bitcoin and agree to pay back 6 Bitcoin in the future. Me and the 20 others still each have 1 Bitcoin each, but now you also have 5 Bitcoin and all of a sudden the money supply was increased.

So yes, a third party can increase the money supply through fractional reserve banking.


One argument against this is, well I would never let coinbase hold onto my Bitcoin! Ok well that is you, and we are expecting worldwide adoption right? My grandmother doesnt know how to log into Facebook. Do you think she will be storing her own private keys? Banks and investment companies don't want and can't afford the level of physical security needed to safely store private keys. All of that money will be looking for a money custodian. And all of the money stored with a custodian could potentially allow for fractional reserve banking",1524676490

"How on earth do you expect crypto to become widely adapted otherwise?  You think the only people in this world that'll use it are the elite?  It will go mainstream, it will get regulated, it will get taxed.  Everything pinned on regular currency will be pinned on crypto, otherwise we'll never get anywhere.

"The main chain isn't maxed out right now. It's averaging around 50-60% of it's capacity. This is also notable because it's about a 1000% increase of bch's blocksize on average over the last month. bchs overall transaction blocksize with exception of a few minor spikes since it started has remained mostly the same - around 50-60k which is tiny. There is only 1 notable timeframe of less than 1 week where the average transaction size was more than 1mb and a few other tiny spikes. So when Roger is praising the use of going to bigger blocks as he is doing again recently- bch doesn't need too. It's marketing.  
  
At any time BTC can increase their chain capacity in the future if really necessary but they don't feel it's worth the burden to the internet (broadband networks will have to maintain parity across all nodes and do you think comcast is going to love the extra bandwidth across their network done in realtime?) and miners to have carry this extra weight.  The lightning network is new so, of course, not a lot of people need it or are using it right now along with the fact that the main network isn't anywhere near capacity so why take the extra step of using the lightning network?  It doesn't make sense.

It seems to be a ever changing and evolving market movement. Pre huge Dec/Jan bullrush to 20k BTC when BTC ran up (pumped) alts would bleed to death and when Bitcoin stopped and went sideways it was alt season and alts would go up. Most recently the run up we have seen seems to be the opposite sorta Bitcoin kinda went up at the same time with alts because it was mostly previous money (from tether) or whatnot re entering the market into their alt positions. You never can tell with market manipulation you just have to keep an eye out for when things start to move out of place for instance I went to USDT last night after BTC pumped up but after the pump and dip on BTC the money did not flow back to alts which immediately triggered in my mind this is a big selloff of recent profits made in the market.

All those insane quotes you hear about btc being $500,000? When they go into detail it actually requires hyperinflation of USD. The purchasing power of 1 dollar decreases therefore the price of commodities increase. An apple will also be $25.

So that 500k actually only has todays purchasing power of lets say 100k. (arbitrary number.) 

If the dollar crashed I would predict btc to behave more like gold during the 2008 crash. It dropped about 30% over 1 year then recovered and then some afterward as people wanted a good place to park their money.

Take a look at the term capital flight. This would occur if USD destabilized. Super rich companies and foreign investment would run away, probably to China. I keep mentioning China for a reason.

I know your mind is in the right place. You're in /r/bitcoin right now. But I don't understand why you think USD is infallable. No economy has ever lasted forever.

A great depression is right around the corner if we stand around and do nothing like we are.

Satoshi Nakamoto recreated gold digitally. This will repair economies over time. I don't even care about the price of btc. After finance school and working in Japan, I decided banks ruined the world by eliminating gold standard and leverging unlimited using your social security dollars etc, so now I work in the crypto space instead. I want to help fix the world economy. This is the goal of crypto.

&gt; so that there is wider feedback, also from the large not-too-technical majority of BCH supporters and users.

Yes, this would be great!!

&gt; Of course, you can make spam transactions and so forth, but isn't the same true with current bitcoinds and nodes spamming them? By implementing ban rules, one can deal with that, and it seems to be sufficient.

I can't think right now of any open attack vector that could compromise your proposal, but history has shown that attackers are always a few steps ahead of us. Ok, what about the honest scenario then: ""What if it's truly successful and there are many many token transactions to validate?"". Like suppose we have gigablocks and you have created the next tether moving millions of USDT back and forth (this would be a true dream for an arbitrageur, believe me!). Miners have the money to validate gigabytes of bch transactions data, but would a SITO validator have as well?

&gt; Yes, and I am not one of the 'give me free shit1!' people.

Oh, I'm not judging, far from it. I just tried to present you another example of a free service that currently works very well without explicit incentives, but might not under future heavier load. If they indeed start charging micropayments, it'll be a great example that incentives are a healthy mechanism to ensure high availability services. IMO this also applies to SITO validators.

&gt; I don't think lots of free transactions will be particularly viable with Bitcoin in the future

It depends on economy of scale. If we manage to get full gigablocks with 1sat/byte fee in 20 years, we have 10bch of fees per block. I guess miners, in their best interest, should play for the long term. If they decide to charge more fees after the next halving, they might cripple the growth of the network and we'll end on a different equilibrium point. The good thing is that the minimum required fee is a nash equilibrium as well: all it takes is one miner to start accepting super low fees transactions and the others will follow. The lower bound is the limit Peter R has been discussing for years, when the marginal revenue fails to compensate for the increased orphaning risk.",1524675116

"Please know all this about lightning before getting too excited 

Essentially, lightning only works as a scaling solution when everyone is already using it. It has no way to bridge the gap from no users(where it is starting) to everyone worldwide using it.

If the node you are trying to pay is offline, you simply can't pay. And you still incur fees when you settle your channels on the restricted blocksize chain.

Worse, it has numerous tradeoffs that will discourage the average person from using it. This amplifies the downsides that arise from it not being universally in use instantly, and will prevent it from ever reaching that state. Here are those:

1. You must be online all the time to be paid. And the person you want to pay must be online for you to pay them.

2. If you go offline at the wrong time and aren't using a centralized hub, you can lose money you didn't even knowingly transact with.

3. The solution to #2 is to enlist ""watchers"" to prevent you from losing money. More overhead the average person isn't going to care about or understand, and more fees that have to be paid. Or people will just be forced to use centralized hubs.

4. Two new users to Lightning will not be able to actually pay eachother without using a centralized hub because no one will lock up funds into the opposing side of their channels; No funded channels = can't pay eachother. Hence... Hubs.

5. Using hubs will come with monthly fee; They aren't going to lock up their capital on your behalf for no cost.

6. The entire system is vulnerable to a mass-default attack. Hubs are especially vulnerable.

7. Lightning will not be able to route large payments(no route available).

8. Lightning transactions are larger than normal transactions.

9. Lightning nodes must keep track of the full history of channel states themselves. If they lose this, they are vulnerable to attacks and may lose coins.

10. Attackers may randomly lock up funds anywhere along the chain of channels for extended periods of time(many hours) at no cost to themselves.

11. The network randomly may fail to work for a user under certain circumstances for no discernable reason as far as they can see (no route available). 


And the issues directly related to the not having everyone on the planet on lightning at first:

1. Small payments consolidating into larger ones, such as a retailer who needs to pay vendors, will fail to route on Lightning, and the loop between the source of the payments(end users) and their destinations(retailers) is broken. This means every channel will ""flow"" in one direction, and need to be refilled to resume actually being used.

2. Refilling every channel will be at least one onchain transaction, possibly two. If this happens twice a month, 1mb blocks + segwit will only be able to serve 4 million users. Some estimates are that Bitcoin already has 2-3 million users.

3. Regardless of lightning's offchain use, Bitcoin must still have enough transaction fees to provide for its network security. Except instead of that minimum fee level being shouldered by 1000 - 500000 million transactions, it is only shouldered by ~170 million transactions with segwit 1mb blocks.
That situation doesn't exist in a vacuum. Users will have a choice - They can go through all that, deal with all of those limitations, odd failures &amp; risks and pay the incredibly high fees for getting on lightning in the first place... Or they can just buy Ethereum, use a SPV wallet, and have payments confirmed in 15 seconds for a fraction of the fees. Or roughly the same choice for SPV+BCH.

The choice will be obvious.

My (and many others) opinion is that lighting is not near as good as people think it will be... It just isn't a scaling solution. Lightning is fine for use cases that need to do frequent, small, or predictable payments with few entities. For example, mining pools paying PPLNS miners. Or gamblers making small bets on gambling sites. Or traders making frequent trades on exchanges.

But as a general purpose scaling solution for average people? It sucks, and they are absolutely not going to go through all of that shit just to use crypto, especially not with better, cheaper, more reliable options out there.",1524674467

also I feel that looking for regular purchasing transactions is the wrong way of looking at it, at least in the short and medium terms. the main draw to Bitcoin isn't that I can buy my coffee with it, fiat works for that just as well, there's no driving ""need"" for that type of accommodation to take place. It's cool and all, but that's not what makes Bitcoin special. 

What makes Bitcoin special is that you can have a reserve of wealth that is unaffected by the fiscal irresponsibility of your countries government and/or banking systems. you can have money outside of their control. this is the main essential Bitcoin is fulfilling and there is no lacking technical that will stop it from happening IMO. 

""Use"" of Bitcoin could very well be masked inside of a load of regular market volume. If your countries economy and subsequent value of its fiat currency was plummeting, the citizens are just buying Bitcoin to preserve their wealth, they aren't buying it to go on trendy shopping sprees to show off their cool new crypto- for anyone essentially NEEDING bitcoin, they're just buying it on the market and tucking it away.

"Today you give custody of your funds to a bank and they can spend those funds as they see fit. Bitcoin isn't like the debt based economy banks work with today. They can't just spend ""imaginary money"" with an IOU to pay it back later. In order to make payments, the bank actually needs custody of the funds, which they never have in the multi-wallet scenario.

With a 2 of 3 multisig wallet, you have funds locked up which need two of three keys to release. You keep one key, you give one key to BankA, and the other key to BankB.

Neither BankA nor BankB can spend your funds without you signing, unless the banks collude to both sign and spend your funds. The way to avoid this is to make sure they are separate entities and have no knowledge of each other. For greater security you can increase the number of entities required to sign things off.

"If you really want to undestand, stop looking at the supply of the currency and start looking at things priced in the currency.  Wealth...you know, ""stuff"", isn't fixed in supply, if I double the amount of stuff for sale in the maket and don't double the amount of money along with it, then the only possible response of the market is that all the stuff must double in price so more wealth can be traded using the same fixed amount of currency.  The amount of wealth (aka stuff) in the world is not fixed in supply and cannot be. Price stability of stuff is achieved by actively managing the supply of money by increasing and decreasing the supply to appropriately match the amount of stuff it's representing, that's something we call the velocity of money.  Since bitcoin's supply cannot be managed, then stuff cannot be kept at the same price over time, it must fluctuate wildly, prices going up drastically anytime more stuff is created and dropping wildly anytime less stuff is created.  Inflation and deflation of the currency supply are how the prices put on stuff are held relatively constant over time.  Bitcoin can't do that and thus can't be a good currency.",1524673826

"Only problem is fundamentally a fork is something a *software implementation* does. You fork the *repo.* For example, with adjustable blocksize caps, what would have been a hardfork for Core in 2016 would not have been any kind of fork for Bitcoin Unlimited. 

In Bitcoin itself there are only *changes in hashpower voting patterns.* 

Hashpower typically votes unanimously on a certain ruleset for a given epoch. On May 15, BCH miners are expected to change their voting pattern *in unison*. That we can call an upgrade. On August 1 of 2017, Bitcoin miners all changed their voting patterns but not in unison, instead bifurcating into two new voting patterns (the Segwit pattern and the 2MB pattern). That we can call a split. 

Glossary:

Upgrade = a unanimous change in the hashpower voting pattern

Split = a non-unanimous change in the hashpower voting pattern

Fork = a change to a given software repository, such as one of the Bitcoin (Cash) implementations (ABC, BU, XT, Bitcrust, Bitprim, Bitcoinj, etc.)

If we don't want to make the Core error of conflating the chain with its dominant implementation, we should probably stop using the term ""fork"" when talking about anything other than specific implementations. ",1524673705

"I've seen chimps who think they're people. Their opinions do not change reality. A chimps DNA is 99% the same as people but that difference prevents fertile intercourse with people. This functional incompatibility is overarching, no matter that both are primates. So it is with BCH. BCH is very similar to BTC, both are viable crypto currencies (primates in this analogy), but BCH is functionally incompatible with the living Bitcoin blockchain created by Satoshi Nakamoto. The opinion of some BCH fans that they are holding real Bitcoins is a cigar smoking chimps delusion, and it's being nurtured by Roger Ver's deceptive behavior. Indulging such fantasy, as you are doing, by not ""deny them agency and the ability to claim they are the real, better vision of bitcoin because they don't need my permission"" might feel unbiased and kind to them, but it's also unfair to the majority of network participants such as node operators, the economic majority of Bitcoin enthusiasts, the developers who've guided the phenomenal growth of Bitcoins value through improvements since Satoshi disappeared, as well as all the businesses who've built their brands on a specific implementation (and reputation) of this years old project, not to mention being rude to the legacy of Satoshi Nakamoto who designed a brilliant system where change depends on consensus.        

&gt; Let's say that some time in the future bitcoin forked again and both chains would be compatible with previous versions. Which one is the real bitcoin in your opinion?

You are describing a contentious hard fork. In such a scenario the two chains would not be compatible with each other, however one (but not both) of those chains would still be compatible with the pre-fork chain. That's exactly what we have with BTC, it's still compatible with older versions while BCH is not. The economic majority might go with either, as we saw with Ethereum, but in that  specific case the new branch was given the old name and the original branch was renamed ""Ethereum Classic"" by, and because there is a leader, Vitalik Buterin to make such decisions on behalf of the community. Bitcoin no longer has such an authority figure, so by default the unchanged branch retains the unchanged name. That's entirely consistent with both the technical functional compatibility I've explained, as well as the traditional naming conventions applied in all opensource software development. Note, my *opinion* on all that is *irrelevant*, just like the beliefs and opinions of cigar smoking chimps.       ",1524672108

&gt; No Bitcoin Core link? First link to a web wallet (urgh).

Yes I tried Bitcoin Core originally. First to be clear, Electrum is officially endorsed by the Bitcoin.org site [here](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) and many other official alt-coin sites (they often use the 'Electrum' suite), so I have a lot of faith in it. Regardless, in Bitcoin Core Wallet, I just found locked away in the ""Help -&gt; Debug window -&gt; Console"" section that you can indeed import and export the raw private key (using the dumpprivkey/importprivkey commands), so in the next update, I might switch over to that.

&gt; Same with ETH, no link to the actual main wallet, first link is a web wallet (that got DNS hijacked yesterday)

First and most importantly, despite that hack (which is fixed now apparently), let me say that if you followed the secure instructions in my spreadsheet, your funds would have been perfectly safe, as it's the offline downloadable GitHub version.  Heck, even with the Easy instructions you would have been safe by using it offline (as suggested).

Anyway, I presume you're referring to the one shown at: https://www.ethereum.org which links to [this](https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases/download/v0.10.0/Ethereum-Wallet-win32-0-10-0.zip). From what I can see, there is no way to export or import the **raw private key** which is what the whole article is about. Instead backing up your account gives a ciphered version (KeyStore) with numerous strings to store. Perhaps more interestingly, it won't let you create your OWN custom private key; you must use the one it creates, so in one way, this makes using MyEtherWallet actually MORE secure. It's also easier/possible to view ERC20 tokens using the MEW software, unlike the ethereum.org software which won't allow you to import a raw private key.

&gt; One of the main XMR devs run's their own webwallet, mymonero.com. might be better to include that than some no name online wallet.

Unfortunately, mymonero.com can only be used online. In fact after clicking ""CREATE A NEW ACCOUNT"", that **very page** suggests: ""*It is recommended that you treat MyMonero as you would treat your actual wallet, and not store very large amounts in it. For long-term storage of Monero you should create a cold wallet using MoneroAddress or similar.*""

Then it links to MoneroAddress.org. And yep, MoneroAddress.org is the site I have on the spreadsheet. For the ""Secure instructions"", I use getmonero.org which is an official site (or at least one of their official sites) and is linked from Wikipedia and Coinmarketcap.com.

&gt; Suggesting web wallets is horribly insecure,

Not if they're downloaded and used offline (on an airgapped computer) as is suggested throughout the whole spreadsheet. And even then, for the secure instructions, it's only as a backup method to ensure the key/address matches.

&gt; Disclosing these details would help people make informed decisions.. as I'm guessing you have used some web wallets a lot (i.e. you trust them)

Without disclosing how much I actually hold (against sub rules I think), many of my altcoins are tiny to small amounts in exchanges, so I may not transfer those just yet, though I would have confidence if I did. Others I've used and trust, and have used my techniques above, but that's no guarantee that they're secure. The ONLY way we can find some semblance of security is by validating the listed sites with reputable and well-established sources as I have done. I'd personally trust all of the links I gave to store funds, but I'm very happy to update the spreadsheet if I come across are even better sources and apps to use.",1524670921

If a sum of money suddenly shows up in your account from an exchange, that will automatically fuck you with the IRS.",1524670587

"Someone explain Tether to me/confirm that I am right/tell me how I am wrong.

Tether is meant to always equal $1.  However, since it is sold on the open market and subject to market forces it can fluctuate just like any other coin.  In order to balance tether at $1, when demand for tether increases past the current supply, more tether are infused into the system and balance at $1 is restored.  Theoretically, if everyone sold their Tether, Bitfinex would need to buy Tether back and take it out of the market to balance at $1.  

So in a non-conspiracy sense, new Tether isn't printed to prop up BTC, it is printed when the price of Tether goes over $1 and needs to be brought back down.

I understand the Bitfinex/Tether conspiracy that Tether is used to pump bitcoin and is not backed by anything, and I do not mean to discount that theory... Maybe its true, maybe not, but I am more interested in how tether would work in the ideal world. 

 I see comments like ""More tether printed to keep BTC from crashing,"" etc... but it would make sense that when the market is going down, Tether is more in demand, so the price increases, so more Tether is necessary to equalize at $1, no?  No conspiracy necessary?

Sadly, I don't think this will come until 2019 at the earliest. Of course I have a little bit in a few alts in hopes they moon, but they can't ALL moon, especially not all the payment/currency coins.

&gt; Can you elaborate on how Satoshi didn't have an insider view? Was it because he was unsure if it would work thus indicating that he didn't have the knowledge of the technical  details behind every aspect that would dictate how the formula would play out? 

I‚Äôm of the opinion that the idea of bitcoin and the societal chess game that is ensuing between the technological anarchists and the global elite, stemming from a system that has been so successful due in large part to the elegance/complexity emergent from the simplicity of the code, could only have come from a true genius. A genius that understood that the dollar comparative to BTC would be so demeaning to it‚Äôs significance that it would act as a trojan horse to deter the establishment from acting against their complacency out of fear of being disrupted. 

That opinion doesn‚Äôt automatically guarantee that the source of that genius must be by definition from ‚Äúthe outside‚Äù, whether you consider that to be outside gender norms or whatever, but I believe it does mean that it could come from anywhere. Just as it‚Äôs unlikely that someone from the outside the typical circles of expertise that could develop an idea that would lead to the backbone of an entirely new economic and governance model, it‚Äôs just as unlikely that someone from the inside reaping the benefits of the old system would intentionally obliterate that. Unless their moral compass was so strong that once they had the idea it needed to be seen through, in which case, again, it could have come from anywhere. 

The facts speak for themselves I think. There are no givens here. The assumptions implicit in just the name ‚Äúsatoshi nakamoto‚Äù must also be in itself misdirection. He or she knew what they were making would threaten the comfort of a lot of seriously powerful people eventually, and doing so publicly would be the gravest mistake one could make. 

&gt; A 50/50 chance is really stretching it, are you willing to put money on that?

BCH did a lot of things that weren't part of the original plan. The emergency difficulty adjustment code that was added specifically broke a rule Satoshi made to help keep the difficulty stable.

I think most people would agree that blindly following the ""original vision"" would be dangerous. For example, Satoshi's original white paper said one CPU one vote. It never even imagined dedicated mining hardware. Things change and the software evolves both when the network grows and when the network is attacked. In fact, Satoshi himself added the 1MB block limit. Who's to say that if he were still around, that he wouldn't still be happy with that limit.


&gt; Why would BTC associate with Bitcoin at all if it doesn't increase block size?

Why? I think that's pretty clear. The 0.10.0 client came out years before any of last year's forks and before segwit was added. I doubt you could find anyone who would argue this wasn't Bitcoin. If you ran that old node now, it would follow right along with the same blockchain as the latest Bitcoin Core node does today. It wouldn't jump to the Bitcoin Cash fork, the Bitcoin Gold fork, or any other Bitcoin fork. You could even send and receive Bitcoin (BTC) with that old client.

I think, technically, it is. And I don't just mean that is BTC the original ticker. The latest core client has come from an unbroken chain of developers working on the original client. Individual developers were removed at times, but there was never a hack that let another group of developers overthrow the current group of developers. Despite all the controversy, it's been a pretty peaceful transition. And yes, some developers have been removed, Gavin Anderson comes to mind for example, but all of them had stopped committing code to Bitcoin at the point where they lost permissions.

The 0.10.0 client came out 3 years before any of last year's forks, and was also before the controversial segwit was added. There was no doubt in anyone's mind that this particular core reference implementation *was* Bitcoin.

If you fired up that node today, it would pick up from where it left off 3 years ago, and follow along with the same blockchain as the latest Bitcoin Core node does today.

However, the overwhelming empirical evidence shows that it doesn't work and that most studies that do favour TA have used weak models to conduct their research. I can guarantee you that institutional investors dont use TA. I understand why people use it and in an unregulated market such as crypto, there is a potential that it works.

"**Argumentum ad populum**

In argumentation theory, an argumentum ad populum (Latin for ""argument to the people"") is a fallacious argument that concludes that a proposition must be true because many or most people believe it, often concisely encapsulated as: ""If many believe so, it is so.""

This type of argument is known by several names, including appeal to the masses, appeal to belief, appeal to the majority, appeal to democracy, appeal to popularity, argument by consensus, consensus fallacy, authority of the many, bandwagon fallacy, vox populi, and in Latin as argumentum ad numerum (""appeal to the number""), fickle crowd syndrome, and consensus gentium (""agreement of the clans""). It is also the basis of a number of social phenomena, including communal reinforcement and the bandwagon effect. The Chinese proverb ""three men make a tiger"" concerns the same idea.

"That's not quite how it works. The current system is rigged to make the rich richer. How else does inflation go up each year *less* than the actual amount of new money issued would indicate?


You think it's an undodgeable tax on wealth? It's not. The ability to make money simply by having money (and being able to better game the system the more money you have) is exactly that. When Uncle Scrooge is invested in a portfolio only available to people with a few million or more to invest, he dodges this tax so much he makes profit. Meanwhile the middle-class who decide to look into the system get the crumbs and still fully dodge it.

The middle-class who don't look into this lose money (difference between inflation rate and savings account interest rate).

The poor can't be part of this system as most entry points have minimums. Unlike everyone else, they can't dodge inflation and are affected the most. By being paid the least, inflation affects them the most until minimum wage increases. Their pay scale doesn't have a built-in barrier by paying them more than they need to live.


&gt;richest 1% will be holding 99% of the bitcoin and you will wish there was inflation from printing bitcoin

This is a misguided statement. The issue isn't the 1% having all the money. The issue is the 1% being in a position of power to get all the money and keep getting it. The issue is the debt-based system hanging over everyone except those in power who make money off of screwing the world. 


Some people being significantly more wealthy than others is only a problem in our current system. It happens in Bitcoin but it is not a *problem* in Bitcoin. At the very least, unarguably, the existence of a wealth gap in Bitcoin isn't and won't be anywhere near as problematic to the less-well-off as it is in the current system.

The ""listed everywhere"" feature does **not** apply to ERC20 tokens.

However, *even if it did*, the assertion would still be blatantly incorrect. Losing 10% of trade volume is *devastating* to an asset's liquidity and market sentiment.

Sure, they'll lose money in the longterm, even if they go 50-50, due to fees. Sure it's a bad idea to daytrade. Doesn't matter, enough people LOVE the gambling aspect.

Myself? I feel I can do a LOT better than just gambling. Invest in solid projects, ignore the shitcoin that went 80% today. Longterm we don't notice when that shitcoin goes -80%, because that's what it was supposed to do. We don't attach much significance to it for that reason. When it pumps, we look at our portfolio and focus on the one that didn't pump and all our attention goes to that. We don't notice the one that went 15% up, because well, that's a good project and we're smart, so of course it did. But that one that went -1% today, and only 2% yesterday, WTF is wrong with that one? 

Zoom out, and they all perform well, if they are good projects. They each get their time in the sun. Just make sure you aren't buying air, and you'll be fine longterm. That's my strategy anyways.

Let the gamblers buy their shitcoins and make their 80% in one day, and lose their 85% the next. Longterm, they make a bunch, lose a bunch more, then quit. That's the gambler way.

"full wikipedia comment:

&gt; TL;DR, for our dear readers who can't make heads or tails of this novelty: Bitcoin is as good as gold, shinier than lead, bubblier than tulips, held deep in the mines, and driving people nuts. Gold has enriched adventurers and bitcoin has held fools to ransom. You may dive in a pool of gold, but lose it all at war. Strangely, while you can still buy gold today and forget about it until your great-grandchildren cash it out, the much-hyped ""future of money"" has turned into the most speculative intangible asset of all time, while proving totally unsuitable as a means of payment. Still, over 2017 at least, bitcoin would have been a better investment than Tesla stock.",1524663962
"For outlaws?

If Bitcoin is meant to lead us to a world where people who screw over others get away scot free, you'll find that not too many people want to be a part of that world.

The foundation of the argument might be weak but the conclusion is still the same. Paypal is irrelevant in crypto land. ",1524663885

Merchants and customers alike will have access to the lowest fees as it is an open source public permission-less network that aims to do away with rent extraction money processors like visa and MasterCard are able to perpetrate. The validators of the network are the token holders and via staking will receive all the network fees generated by every transaction.   ",1524663883

"I actually post here i think more than any other sub. I literally am 100% in love with the concept of cryptocurrency. It has given freedom back and already worked in ways the state cannot stand. 

If you held bitcoin at the time bch forked off, we got the best situation possible looking back at it. We got a hedge. We get an equal amount of each. One group to try to large block scaling, and another to try off chain scaling. We can take what we learn from each and it will benefit each project. 

Now, negativity from this sub is hurting crypto overall. And I post in this sub because it doesn't jive with my mind. We are supposed to be freedom lovers. The undeniable fact is bitcoin cash forked off of bitcoin. It is not a big deal. Love your project and do your best to scale via big blocks. All the effort to claim the name of bitcoin is holding the project back from true adoption. 

Think about it. Real bitcoin has institutional investors, it has futures, etc. It also has 9 years of proven track record of security. 

As a merchant, why would I want to aleniate users of bitcoin, by claiming bitcoin cash is the real bitcoin. 

All I'm saying it is a fight that doesn't have a clear end in sight, or a positive outcome. And for that reason it makes me question the motivations of people like Roger Ver who push this narrative, because they do know better",1524663437

A favicon  (short for favorite icon), also known as a shortcut icon, website icon, tab icon, URL icon, or bookmark icon, is a file containing one or more small icons, associated with a particular website or web page. A web designer can create such an icon and upload it to a website (or web page) by several means, and graphical web browsers will then make use of it. Browsers that provide favicon support typically display a page's favicon in the browser's address bar (sometimes in the history as well) and next to the page's name in a list of bookmarks. Browsers that support a tabbed document interface typically show a page's favicon next to the page's title on the tab, and site-specific browsers use the favicon as a desktop icon.

Losing a hw wallet is not really a big deal, as the backup seed follows [BIP0039](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki) and you can use the seed on any compatible wallet to recover your keys.

I personally know several people who lost money due to sudden reputable (at the time) exchange shutdown and I've read hundreds of horror stories over the last 5 years. I have yet to meet a person who lost money from a hardware wallet. As long as you do a proper seed backup you're very safe.

The only reason I have any bitcoin is because I was paid in it.,1524662748
"Quick breakdown of my thoughts on your links:

1. Seems OK to me. You openly call Bitcoin Cash ""BCash"", no need to be a hypocrite. BTC - Bitcoin Core (BTC) AFAIC. ""*Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Core, LOL*"" ...
2. I've been in agreement with Roger about the blocksize increase, I've agreed with him on how disgusting all the attachers were on XT, BU, Classic. He's a passionate dude, and if he wants to fund projects, fantastic. Don't know how that's a bad thing? I'm also not a maximalist, have no issue with alts. Everything else in WhalePanda's call to arms is subjective and only serves as character assassination. The point of it is?
3. Bitcoin.com pool is separate from other ventures that Roger backs and pays for with BTC. It would be unethical to expect miners using his pool to mine his transactions for free. What a stupid point! I agree that a pay to many transaction could have been used, but would have had privacy implications. Sure, my employer doesn't pay in crypto, but if they did I'd rather my employment transactions not be bundled in with everyone else's for everyone else to see. 
4. Seems to be the same group of posts as yours. 
5. I've seen some of that in real time and agree it's hypocritical. Some of those are also used in that list out of context, but nevertheless, I agree that if you're going to tout censorship-free zones, you should be 100% transparent in all moderation.
6. He didn't openly admit to BCash anything. He openly admitted to promoting Bitcoin Cash as Bitcoin if the NYA failed. While slowly making progress he has been true to his word.
7. He only saw the MtGox bank books and they were OK and solvent. Either way, people who were stuck in MtGox weren't getting out and had already lost their life savings even if he had stayed quiet. Bad PR move on his part, but overblown by people like you with an agenda.
8. Can't be linked to Roger with any objectivity. Moot point.
9. Yeah, ratcliff is a flip-flopping fool who sold almost all his BTC to pay off his credit card debts. That statement is 100% hearsay and isn't proof of anything.
10. Roger called Jamie out on that sockpuppet and made the conversation public. That was pretty transparent on Roger's part and doesn't do anything to prove your case.
11. That happens across the entire crypto space every day. This can't be linked to Roger, as much as you want it to be.
12. Agreed that the move was unethical. Roger admitted to it in the 3rd post in the thread. 
13. That's proof of nothing. There are bots on Twitter trying to push up the price of every coin out there. Claiming Roger is the one paying for those is disingenuous at best.
14. That's not conclusive of anything by any stretch of the imagination. Nice try though.
15. I don't know if their August pay-run runs on the same day as Roger posted. Assuming it does, it was probably exaggerated which is shitty. Assuming it's 2 weeks in arrears and 2 in advance, paid in the middle of the month, the costings are pretty close. Admittedly, he posted on the 2nd of September, so it's a good assumption that they do their pay runs a month in arrears. Therefore, this one is probably him lying.
16. Yeah, I agree. Very unlikely to have paid $600 for a single transaction and he was rightly called out.

So, all in all, that's what, 2 to 3 out of 16 of your points that really have any substance?",1524662695
Who needs sleep when you have crypto,1524662580

Just because something is being created by a Russian team, doesn't make it sketchy. Unknown does not make it sketchy. Guilty until proven innocent? A lot of projects in the crypto space are very risky, therefore you should always DYOR. Because a team has modest means and a modest start, doesn't automatically make it sketchy.

&gt;Any platform that supports smart contracts can support an escrow system.

You can literally say this about a lot ERC20 tokens.

&gt;Any platform that supports smart contracts can support a bounty system.
&gt;Any platform that supports smart contracts can support a messaging system.
&gt;Any platform that supports smart contracts can support a kittens system.
&gt;Any platform that supports smart contracts can support a immutable and secure digital identities system.",1524662507

If both Bitcoin Core and Cash are faulty... and I think they are as well...   What crypto are you arguing for?   Or are you arguing against the whole genre?,1524662342
"It might be an edge, but those worldwide bank payments are feasible only for first world countries. Yes you can transfer between US banks fast and cheap. Yes you can transfer between US and EU.

What about the other parts of the world? Do you know how much are fees and delay times, if your transfer is accepted? Because there's the possibility that you cant even transfer if you want to. Some banks might use SWIFT, some dont. Some banks dont send money to other banks they dont have agreements with.

Not to mention, exposing your bank information to every vendor/employer/freelancer you might.

With Paypal you just give them your email, and everything is between your bank and paypal.

Paypal is a godsend and no crypto can kill it yet.",1524662330

"Also, the speculation is that the move from test net to main net will be smooth. As more and more people start to use it, new issues won't occur. At its current evaluation, people are viewing their test net as a perfect product, when in actuality, there probably will be new issues that the team will have to face after their transition...With that being said, if EOS can deliver what they say with little to no issues, then it should deserve a top spot in the crypto space because it sounds like an awesome project imo",1524662159
Forget those guys who accidentally lost their 10000 BTC wallets. This guy made the biggest mistake in crypto by far. He literally had a money printing machine. He could have been set for life. Even cashing out 1 million dollars a month wouldn't be too suspicious but he blew his load all at once and now his literal unlimited money printing machine is broken. ,1524662113

"I disagree. Our 350-400 billion total market cap is peanuts to these investors. They don't need to get in at the absolute floor to make obscene amounts of money. They can pump this whole market up x5 and then compound that without how much money they will be making. They don't care about us small guys. 

This year is going to make 2017 look like blip on the radar. A lot of people missed the boat, not enough people realized true gains, and there was only a small amount of people in from the beginning of the year. All those people that got missed out or burned are waiting on their chance. Just look at the correction we just had from 6500 BTC. People are literally foaming at the mouth.

Yes it is. Also enabling the LN doesn't change the fact that only Bitcoin has had blocks &gt;1MB.

Bitcoin doesn't have that. 

I can cite the definitions of water and urine used by medical licensing boards that are deferred to by government to prove the difference.

There is no body recognized by the government that can do the same thing as far as defining what fork ""Bitcoin"" applies to. It's a brand term, not a scientifically defined material. The current iteration you think ""bitcoin"" is actually several forks removed from the original. 

Do you really want the US government defining which fork is and isn't afforded brand protections for the term bitcoin? Because if so you just handed the reigns of future development to them!!! YAY",1524661960

"Does anyone else here think that there is potentially still a more secure way to store crypto. Afterall if ledger ever pushes a malicious app or malicious firmware update we are all screwed. We moved from trusting an exchange to trusting ledger. 

Like google solving the problem of search, whoever creates an infallible way to easily secure crypto will become one of the worlds biggest companies.

It comes down to securing the seed and allowing a device to sign transactions without trusting in devs to do the right thing.

Any ideas???

How about a decentralised protocol using IPFS to manage all this through an app? No idea how that might work though..",1524661924

What matters?

Coinbase new registrations are increasing. Binance registrations are increasing. Twitter and Reddit traffic is up. BTC buy order book volume is at recent highs. 92% of executed trades are from the buy order book.

Throw that TA horseshit away. Why not just get a fortune telling or get your palms read.

There is ONE TA pattern that matters in speculative markets and that's the cup and handle, but only when applied properly, over a long timeframe. For example, once BTC hits 20k again, the old 20k and the new 20k will form the edges of the cup. There will be a lot of selloff pressure due to people breaking even or taking profits and playing now with house money (people that bought in the dip).

Those sales will drop price for a bit (this is the handle portion of the cup and handle), after which it breaks out again.

Clients don't really give a fuck if you have issues with Paypal or whatever, they just know they need to pay and they want to do it the fastest and easiest way possible, if I tell them I only accept crypto and that now they need to go and find out how to buy crypto and learn to use wallets etc they won't do it.. Sure you might say well they can just buy crypto and hold it and have it ready for payment, well yeah that's in a perfect world but with the way crypto moves their money might be worth much less/more by the time it's time to pay again, so it's an unnecessary gamble they need to play on their end.",1524661691
no.  this is literally just crypto.  Right now bitcoin is down 1.45% with lots of buy pressure on the exchanges I use.  1.45% might be strong movement when you are talking about traditional securities but this is just another wednesday for bitcoin.  10% isn't even that big of a deal until its day after day.,1524661635

"Yeah... misleading. Not a scam because it's a real coin, but when someone wants to buy bitcoin they ""want the one on the news"", not to buy into some lame argument over scalability. I went to bitcoin.com when I was new, but pretty quickly realized it was bitcoin.org because I knew the symbol of BTC already from years past.  Even without knowing that the page raises other red flags as you go through it.

This is a tough one for me because I don't like ver, but I also don't think we should be so concerned with the ever mentioned ""naive new user"". Everyone has an obligation to their own finances to do their research and select what seems safe... If they throw their money at the first ""buy bitcoin"" page they visit they have much worse things to worry about than buying a fairly stable altcoin instead of BTC. These people will also end up with more computer viruses and malware, falling prey to phishing scams by not checking web / email addresses before paying for items and the list goes on forever. As much as I don't like the bcash crew, people have to be responsible for their actions. I read an article that more than 75% of financial transactions through Nigeria are fraudulent in nature.. Nigeria!! the place where they pump out ""money flip"" scams, ""Nigerian Prince"" emails, and ""your power is being cut"" cold calls..  Not sophisticated bank attacks, just simple ""idiot fishing"" adventures that are landing them huge stats like that. People NEED to be smarter!",1524661559

Just a reminder folks, when BTC goes up like lightning, alts will ALWAYS crash.  Its just the way this shit works.  If you see BTC starting a run, its usually a safe bet to cash out 25-50% of your alts to buy the resulting dip.",1524661391

"&gt; Coinbase founders voluntarily founded a company in that

So what?  They founded a company in the US, and they have to follow US laws.   There's literally no reasonable basis for holding THAT against Coinbase.   You just have ridiculous unreasonable expectations of Coinbase.    The US-based exchanges are still providing a useful service many people need,   and Bitcoin users should still be encouraging newbies to use *ANY* exchange that best meets their needs  and can most easily get them Bitcoins.

Coinbase is absolutely fine providing their main service --- an easy-to-use exchange  and trading platform;  just DONT expect to  Spend directly from your CB wallet.     Users are best served buying BTC on Coinbase, and then immediately transferring crypto to their own private wallets for spending purposes.

Many people exist in that environment,  and many people have a practical use for the services of Coinbase and other exchanges that exist  INSIDE  US jurisdiction,  because exchanges outside US jurisdiction cannot so-easily deal with and take deposits from US sources:   there are also nasty compliance issues for any US citizen wishing to do a significant amount of business with an  outside-jurisdiction exchange;   not to mention US banks restricting the use of international wires,  charging exorbitant fees for them, and freezing accounts that do much movement of funds in and out of jurisdiction.

"I think theres an important differentation to be made. Forking should definitely be encouraged I agree. However, deceptive practices should not. What Ver is doing by calling BCH Bitcoin is an idealistic land grab which is fine imo, if it were the only consequence. He is doing it in a way though which can confuse and mislead people, which some could argue is fraud when he has a personal stake in it's adoption. It's like if someone forked Linux, and stood to make money on each install. If that person called the real Ubuntu something else on their website Ubuntu.com and called their fork ""the real Ubuntu"", people would say it was scammy. Thats my gut reaction to what he is doing by misrepresenting the names without a prominent disclaimer on the site along the lines of ""Most people call BTC the real Bitcoin and BCH Bitcoin Cash, we believe that BCH is the real Bitcoin and BTC is a bankster scam""

I greatly love the idea to stop using paypal and move to strictly crypto, but the issue seems to me, to be adoption of more crypto sales online, and accepting that their coin is a coin, and should be spent.",1524661087

"It is fair to compare BCH to Ripple because BCH is completely centralized. 

Litecoin produces blocks at five times the rate of bitcoin.",1524660926
"We _did_ increase it with segwit, and now we're testing out the biggest scaling upgrade in bitcoin history on the main network. ",1524660900
This is a great indicator to show how strong the Bitcoin BCH community is and the surge of interest in a real peer-to-peer cash system for the world.   There is an overwhelming amount of new projects and excitement within Bitcoin Cash- and we've only just begun. ,1524660896
I will be checking up on it every 6 months and possibly moving it around in different hardware wallets to make sure or even spread the BTC into 1k parts in different wallets ,1524660889

&gt; Whenever you read the comments section of an article, tweet, or Reddit post about \#BitcoinCash, just remember that there is literally an army of paid trolls whose job is to slander BCH 24/7.

&gt; \#BitcoinCash will disrupt many legacy businesses, the pushback is not surprising.

At the end of it, I am no longer Pro-BTC, but Pro-efficiency, and freedom. And I will support whatever chain provides the most of those. Should BCH become tainted, I have no problem jumping ship.

"That's the narrative pushed by Bitcoin maximalists, everything that isn't Bitcoin is basically a scam, especially if it threatens their coin's dominance.

On the other hand, Bitcoin's problems, such as that the network was heavily congested with high fees and in November and December and transactions took hours or even days, or that nobody knows how to scale the Lightning Network to millions of nodes, those problems are brushed under the rug...

"&gt; Certainly not p2p if you don't have fraud proofs or validate your txs

Let's look at worst case scenarios. You could still have this, even if the chain were to become very bloated for regular users, if you are willing to pay the price. 

But let's pretend it wasn't an option. Then you would have a chain where the hashing nodes themselves (pools and solo miners) would be operating as P2P and users strictly speaking would not be. This still leaves the chain as well as wallets open to competition. if one node goes down, it's most likely not a big deal. 

However in the LN network, the one node going down might be critical. The money could be frozen for a long time before transferable to another wallet. 

(Separate note, even worse if the fees on the layer one chain are actually intended to become constantly high, in some developers terminology confusingly labeled ""a fee market"". The still hashing 'Bitcoin' nodes could then be spammed, resulting in delays or attacks on the ""settlement transactions"". Thus exposing LN users to even graver risks)",1524660083

Leaving the gas station, I saw this awesome woman truck driver by the side of the road, on an oily asphalt road in a freezing Canada. 

She kicked the truck‚Äôs tire as she lifted her gear; she just finished fixing whatever it was she was fixing. 

It was a scene to behold, mainly because I don‚Äôt recall ever seeing a movie with a woman truck driver in. And in my personal view*, it absolutely looked better on a woman to tame that huge 18-legged beast than it ever did on a man. 

Everyone should be able to (&amp; enabled to) do what they want, when they want and for any reason they choose; as long as it doesn‚Äôt unfairly step on the wants of others.

This whole push in the media to diminish the social structures which have worked for thousands of years will result in ungodly chaos. There‚Äôs a reason humanity organized into families, clans, tribes, regions, flags, religions, cultural traditions, languages, etc... 

Crypto currency already sets the path in motion for extreme independence and new, uncharted social structures; we need no such manipulation from above anymore. 

Men and women and all living creatures should be equal in anything they as individuals believe should be equal in; not in everything and not nothing by default.

"It's not a particularly shocking conclusion. Basically, they showed that a computer can be coerced into broadcasting various types of electromagnetic signals or sounds if you perform the right operations. These signals could then be received by a nearby receiver.

This way, it is possible for a computer to broadcast data despite not being connected to any type of network. However, since these techniques have a very low effective bandwidth, they're not particularly useful for trying to steal large amounts of data. But a Bitcoin private key is just 256 bits, which can be done quite rapidly.

This form of attack falls in the category of side-channel attacks. They can be hard to properly defend against in some cases, but they're also hard to implement, because they require specific knowledge of the hardware used (for example: one way to perform this attack is by making the hard disk generate specific noises to transmit information, but doing this effectively requires detailed knowledge on which instruction you have to send to the disk in order to generate a specific sound / vibration).

In particular, for private key theft, it's required that the cold wallet machine is infected with malware that is able to execute this attack. If your airgapped machine is clean, then there's no problem.

In addition, executing this attack requires the presence of a receiver close to the airgapped machine.",1524659592

"It's staking, not stalking :)  
The really short explanation is that it is an alternative way to handle transactions for a coin.  
You, as a coin owner, let your PC contribute to the network and in return you receive coins. Unlike bitcoin mining your PC does not have to perform any tasking actions so even an ancient PC or a raspberry PI can be used for staking.  
Staking always works out to a flat % returns based on having your pc on 24/7: for example ARK and NEBL will work out to ~10% coins annually. Stake 10.000 NEBL for a year and you'll have received 1000 NEBL for your contribution.",1524659490

"**Here is an actual panel of Bankers** from various countries during Ripple's Swell conference.  **Their Exact words are** (watch video):

Bankers on the panel:

- Paula Da Silva - Head of Transaction SEB (2nd largest bank in Sweden)

- Hirofumi Aihara - The Bank of Tokyo  (Japan)

- Darmesh Desai - Yes Bank (India)

- Richard Dell- Banco Santander (Largest Spanish Bank, operations all over the world)

Info about the panel @ 4:57



&gt; **There is no demand for XRP** (31m28s)

and 

&gt; **We cannot use XRP** (because of regulations, cross border regulations, lack of demand (liquidity))

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9acCnUSLW7Q#t=31m28s


Because Banks cannot use XRP, Ripple has been ""attempting"" to market itself for Money Transfer companies for ""small"" but ""high volume"" remittance payments.  This is directly from **Ripple itself saying xRapid is not designed for banks**:

&gt; xRapid is our first product that settles with XRP and it's not aimed at banks

https://twitter.com/JoelKatz/status/977752182198910976

&gt;  We felt the best first target was the kind of low-value, high-volume remittance-like payments we could get at companies like our xRapid partners.

https://twitter.com/JoelKatz/status/977749802829062144


*So Banks do not need XRP, they don't want XRP and they cannot use XRP.*  Ripple itself has realized this and is in their words ""ATTEMPTING"" to market differently.  The fact is Ripple shills make it seem like XRP is adopted and being used.  It is not.  It's being used for a bunch of pilot programs.  It there actually was a demand for it, it would not be dumping like every speculative asset in crypto.  

Cuallix a tiny tiny company (if look at its location on Google maps / Street Map it has small back alley locations) is the only one that acutally claims to be using Xrapid. 

So has become Ripple desperate to create demand and tried to buy its way into Coinbase and Gemini:

QuadrigaCX is part of Coinbase and has to be used since Coinbase doesn‚Äôt allow Canadian users to withdraw our worth with them back to fiat(stupid I know)

So being that QuadrigaCX is the only option(again just from what I know) would that make it unreliable as well?

"&gt; Zencash and zcash should both have like a z and a t address for stealth and transparent addresses. I don't think it works exactly the sms but it's pretty much the same idea akaik

Yes they use the same kind of t and z adresses but this is not the same as ""stealth adress"" as the ones used in Monero.

&gt; I thought one had gone to starks now but it was a little hard to see as they both seem to talk about them a lot

Starks are still in development, there is no implementation available and probably won't be for a long time so no coins can use it yet.

&gt; I don't know own where you get that bitcoin private came before anything. It's only like 2 months old. Unless you're saying that just because it's essentially just zclassic. 

Exactly, BTCP is just a re-brand of ZClassic. ZClassic forked from ZCash, Zen forked from ZClassic that then rebranded to BTCP.

&gt; Pivx is still very similar. Yeah pos, masterminds and voting will soon be different, but zerocoin I'd also a coin mixing process. 

Big difference is that Zerocoin is on the protocol level and can not be compared to the kind of non-cryptographic mixing (Coinjoin) that is implemented in Dash. Cryptographic, protocol level mixing is something way more advanced than a simple coin mixer. Zerocoin mathematically breaks links between coins while a mixer only obfuscates the coins origin.

&gt; I get not liking closed source for cloakcoin but was that part of this? Thought it was just security coins and they have a legitimate different method, supposedly anyways

Indeed it is a bit of an apples vs oranges comparison. My point was rather that no one in their right mind should trust a coin, let alone a privacy coin that does not have an open source code. Hence I don't count Cloak as a contender.",1524659011

When he found out how much Paypal charged (international transfer plus currency conversion), he quickly started googling alternatives (and came up with a really good one in Transferwise).

All that said, I have offered numerous clients the chance to pay in crypto but either they didn't really know enough about it or the few who did were paying through their companies rather than personally and the companies didn't have the infrastructure.

We have people like Adam Back (CEO of Blockstream) indicating high fees are great. We have Greg Maxwell (ex Blockstream) celebrating high fees. It is obviously they wanted high fees.

BCH people wants Bitcoin Cash to be Cash for the entire world. And they know to do that, every transaction must have low fees to include everyone, especially the unbanked.

Crypto Buy Signals¬†/¬†15 hours ago
BTC is forming a reversal head and shoulder pattern on daily chart. its testing the neckline (9200$-9300$) levels trying to break out.¬† If the price isnt pushed down we may see it break trough resistance 9400 and 9500. For now RSI indicates that BTC is over bought, but it can stay in this situation for a couple of days. We have to stay alert as we approach friday, this friday is BTC future contracts due. We may see a dip to 8k levels.

The price fluctuated between 11.2k and 9.5k in a matter of a few days. It fully recovered and resumed its ascent.

This general pattern repeated itself several times during the bull run up to 20k. If you are trading, sure, take advantage of the dip, but to anyone thinking this is Mayday, try to put things into perspective, and realize that we can‚Äôt go up daily ad infinitum.

Go through an airport, a dozen airports, a thousand airports and logically you aren't subject to currency import/export rules. Are you bringing any financial instruments anywhere? No. Unless they rewrite the rules to tax anyone who possesses financial instruments just by that person moving then it'll be that way. And when would they do that? They're the rich - they don't want to be taxed like that.

Hypothetically one could say your laptop or phone 'contains' the cryptocurrency but at least they need some reason to look through it and they can't say everyone with a laptop or phone is carrying money.

There has been a hand off - Greg left the front organization.  My guess is the original Bitcoin trolls had to ""train the trainers"" before cashing out.  Now, bankers and governments are running this.  They are more directly plumbed in to reddit and other sites, have better researched psychological techniques, spend more time accumulating lists with identity information, and have direct access to freshly printed USD.

Price is a major factor for the new team and ""rankings"" are everything to them.  These are the psychological trump cards.  At this point I expect _every project_ near the top is targeted for asset acquisition.  We can all see which coins are moving and when.  EOS may be a peer project of ours, whatever you think about the design, Larimer appears to have clean motives, and I am sure that the pedos have been smothering Blacksburg VA lately.

The Craig Wright takedown is significant.  This community complied.  Rick didn't say tar and feather anyone.  Then a few relativists post threads and reply to themselves and r\btc ate it up.  For some reason this community knows all about BTC, LTC, XRP, but completely ignores ETH, despite the fact it's Vitalik continually inserting himself in the Satoshi discussion.  The ego component there is huge - and it's totally lost on r\btc.  I prefer the way Roger approaches the Craig situation.

I've used various store fronts that accept bitcoin via bitpay and it's brilliant - but I can't help but feel longterm it isn't doing anyone any favours in terms of being considered adoption. I see a lot of adoption posts saying ""company X now accepting crypto Y"", only to find when I click through to the post/article, they've simply integrated a cryptocurrency payment processor (i.e. bitpay) as a payment option. I was under the impression that REAL adoption is accepting actual crypto (i.e. I pay for my meal by sending [crypto] from my personal wallet to the restaurants wallet).

In my view, crypto payment processors are not helping with adoption...do you agree/disagree - why?

I also don't see how they have a sustainable (long term) business model - so if you have any insight to that I'd be interested to read on it, I found one other [thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2r91d5/how_the_hell_does_bitpay_profit_or_even_break_even/) around 3 years old that asks the same thing, with no real conclusion - yet bitpay is still around - so they must be doing something right - but I do not believe they make enough with fees.",1524653506

This is discrediting someones arguments based on what other people thought about that person's previous comments in the community, which in r/btc is correlated with how much you support BCH and attack BTC (and respective associates).

I've been downvoted for explaining the problems of the EDA to people and clearing up confusions about how LN works.

Exactly the reason why 3 years back while working at an Indian crypto exchange we built an Autosell feature specifically for freelancers wherein the freelancer could accept Bitcoin payment on his address and it would immediately convert his BTC into INR and put it in his bank account without any manual intervention and at ZERO PERCENT FEE.,1524652674
"&gt; Btrash blocks are bigger. 

Exactly this.  It takes 8 times as many transactions to fill a single block with high fee transactions.  Bitcoin has small blocks so a single block can be filled with spam easily forcing other transactions with lower fees to wait for the next block and the next and so on.   Btrash doesn‚Äôt have this problem because their blocks are too big to fill and even if you did fill them it would cost 8 times as much to do it.  

May 15th it gets even harder as they will use a hard fork to upgrade from 8MB blocks to 32MB blocks.",1524652650

"A Pump‚Äòn‚ÄòDump Group is hinting that a new ZCL fork will be created: 

I quote: 

#############
What I can share right now is the Dev team is based out of a Miami Blockchain incubator. The media production team are ex CNN executives and there are multiple social media and crypto business founders and personalities in the crypto space that are already supporting the project (not publicly yet as we have not formally announced). The website (roadmap, team page, executive summary, method of forking, coins being forked, differentiating factors, etc.) and social media (Discord, Telegram, Twitter, Reddit) will be live next week, following the main announcement.

Our Miami team watched what the BTCP and many other recent forks messed up from delays to exchange listings. We have already solved the issues that plagued prior forks while also deciding on incorporating new features that further differentiate our project. The current forking plan (punny I know) is to fork ZCL (again)‚Ä¶however, each ZCL fork has been worth between $35-$400 with Bitcoin forks worth in excess of $800. This means our current fork of ZCL should be priced by the market between $35-$800 based on market adoption, the team, the tech, etc. Market adoption will be TBD in the future but we will announce a top 5 (likely top 2) exchange listing more than a month from the fork date to alleviate concerns. The coin will be a privacy coin but instead of mimicking BTCP we are adding differentiating features. The most sought features from other coins we are incorporating into our ZCL fork so we are significantly different than BTCP while still having the ZCL privacy features.

I can only share some of the newly planned features with you but unlike BTC, BCH, and BTCP our privacy coin when held in our wallet will provide a daily return based on how long you‚Äôve held the coin (more details to come soon). This will limit trading supply while simultaneously increasing demand by providing compensation to long term holders. Being able to receive a return on your holding, privacy features, a team that on paper will blow away any curious investor, technology that will impress the crypto community, and a website that will make the entire process simple are just some of the reasons our forked coin will be so valuable.

Verge should not be mentioned among privacycoins as it is just a copy of wallet-features already available for Bitcoin + clones of Bitcoin.

Cloakcoin is closed source last time I checked so it kind of falls outside the category as well.

At some point, a better crypto breaks out and just eats the entire market.

This doesn't matter(stolen , lost or damaged HW wallets) as the 12 or 24 word backup restores all your txs and btc and HW wallets have pins that delay access exponentially with every wrong attempt.

&gt;So what's so wrong with storing it on coinbase,

Bitcoin is P2P currency. Storing bitcoins on exchanges, banks or web wallets makes you insecure and makes the whole ecosystem insecure indirectly by centralizing bitcoin. 

Bitcoin is a bearer asset with ~immutable txs unlike fiat. This means that internal or external thieves  prefer to target what they can take and won't be reversed like digital fiat. Having centralized exchanges and banks store BTC makes it a desirable target for these attacks. 


There are privacy concerns with storing your bitcoins with third parties

You are exposed to tax theft, asset forfeiture theft , civil theft 

You are exposed to exit theft 

You are exposed to the exchange refusing to support a split asset where they steal it , throw it away, or delaying a payout causing you to lose opportunity costs and profit

**Never store your bitcoins in a web wallet or exchange . You own 0 bitcoins if you do not control your private keys.**

The Rio PMP300 is one of the first portable consumer MP3 digital audio players, and the first commercially successful one. Produced by Diamond Multimedia, it was introduced September 15, 1998 as the first in the ""Rio"" series of digital audio players, and it shipped later that year.

"I have to say the Napster analogy is probably the BEST analogy I have heard about this situation! So very, very, very, fucking true!


And to continue with your idea; I remember when we first started selling MP3 players in major computer stores (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_PMP300). Myself and the tech manager were wondering if it would be legal or not. They were selling for $300, and there was only one make/model/brand. We were both sure the device would be pulled within a few months.

But less than a year later, there were a couple more MP3 players on the shelf (around the same price point) and that's when we knew the dam had been broken. They couldn't ban MP3s. The file size was ideal, the transfer was great, they did everything a cassette tape, or compact disc (red book) could do, with greater efficiency, and **ALMOST** decentralized. People wanted MP3's because they give the customer what they want. Small space, ease of use, transferability (sound a bit like Bitcoin?)


I've always been a nethead. Not much of a hacker (perhaps a skript kiddie during *those* days) but I love reading about tech, and experimenting. I see the same thing happening with Bitcoin, as has happened with MP3s, torrents, BBS's, AOL, Google, etc.


People want what works best, for them, in the environment they're using it. Natural selection here. No point in sending a check through the mail anymore, when a debit card number will do. No point in debit/credit numbers, when bitcoin will do. No point in a bank, when a wallet will suffice. Why should I buy a $30 CD, install a $400 stereo system in my car, when a $40 USB drive and a subscription to iTunes works? Why buy movies, when NetFlix scratches that same itch for 1/10th the cost?

"Exactly.

The Ethereum community had collectively decided to call the hard fork ""Ethereum"". In a software sense, Ethereum classic follows the original pre-fork protocol. Whether the name change is right or wrong is a matter of opinion. But Ethereum classic is not so much a debate about technology, but rather policy. And this is one of the reasons why I am still a proponent of Bitcoin. And that is, Ethereum classic stands for immutability for morally questionable centralized governance. In Ethereum, decentralization lost and became Ethereum classic. In Bitcoin, decentralization is still winning.

The fact that Ethereum changed in order to ""rob"" (or in their opinion, ""fix"") a person's balance, tells me everything I need to know about their fundamental beliefs. I am not interested in a system that isn't bound by both immutable mathematics and by immutable wallet balances.

What's the point of someday, either a central power or a collective power decides, ""meh, I don't like you. I'm going to make your bank balance $0.""?

Your coin is exactly the same as Verge, TOR + Stealth adresses = useless. You need cryptographic ledger privacy to even be considered a privacy coin. TOR hides your ip, cool but that can be done with any coin + a TOR wallet. SA is weak privacy and also a wallet level feature that any Bitcoin close can implement in a wallet. That is what you have right now.

From the whitepaper:  DeepSend is currently planned to be a CoinJoin/Mixer technology. In other words as of now you have nothing but a Verge clone but you are planning to implement a mixer-feature.

"&gt; Nonsense. If you defraud someone by promising bitcoin but delivering btrash, then it's simple fraud and you are liable.

This is an interesting question. If such issue ever were presented in court I wonder what the judge would do. Let's say that person A says it was offered a bitcoin on some website and paid for it and got bcash instead. Is that a fraud?
First you'd have to have an absolute definition of bitcoin. BCH crew disagrees with the current paradigm and claims their coin is closer to the true bitcoin vision. BTC crew says their arguments are horseshit. And portion of community agrees and another disagrees.

So what would judge do if there is no real brand protection in this space, there are regular forks everywhere and depending on personal definition and individually chosen specific criteria bcash can be real bitcoin or btc can be real bitcoin in many people's eyes. For people ideologically rooted in one or another this is unacceptable that both could be it but the judge doesn't care about personal opinions, biases, preferences and ideological differences, he has a to make a ruling based on something tangible.

So in my opinion judge will tacke this issue from another angle. Because he sees both groups shouting ""no u!"" he abandons that route and instead asks how the transaction looked like exactly.

Example 1: person A paid person B 9k for 1 btc. Got 1 bch instead. You cannot argue that person B acted in good faith here even if they're ideologically inclined to claim or believe that bitcoin cash is real bitcoin. Person A clearly paid a price very close to the current volatile rate of exchange of the btc coin but got bch coin instead. Clear fraud.

Example 2: person A paid person B 1.4k for 1 bitcoin. Person A says they were cheated and they wanted ""real"" bitcoin. Person B says in their opinion bitcoin cash is real bitcoin because (litany of reasons). This is where the whole thing gets muddy. Is the person A aware that btc goes for 9k and they were possibly buying something else? Did person B tried to trick person A into buying bch instead of btc or simply honestly acted in good faith because they truly believe that bch is the real bitcoin? Did person A specifically requested btc coin or just ""bitcoin"" in general? Is person A just trying to be cute and bully person B to give them 1 btc for a huge discount using the court? In my opinion the judge will try to gauge the motives of both parties and whether someone was trying to trick the other person. What if the person selling bcash bought it from someone else claiming it was bitcoin and was sure they own bitcoin and was selling it in good faith? The list of possible angles goes on and on but I don't think in this case it will be declared a fraud at all. A fraud is a wrongful or criminal deception intended to result in financial or personal gain. If you paid 1.4k and got a coin that is worth 1.4k then there is no real financial gain here tbf. Judge will probably just think it was a mistake or bad communication because cryptospace is batshit crazy and rife with ideological differences.

&gt;If you publish false misleading information publicly, them you could be sued.

"No, every other crypto currency does not try to steal the name. Ethereum is not ""Bitcoin Ether"" and Litecoin is not ""Bitcoin Lite"". That's what makes ""Bitcoin Cash"" a phishing scheme, and deliberately trying to take the name itself.

The congestion you talk about would exist in every cryptocurrency, but only Bitcoin has the transaction volume to be affected by it. And it's blazing new trails in that sense. The others will need to solve the problem someday, but because very few people use them today, they haven't hit that issue. But when they do, they will likely COPY exactly what Bitcoin did to solve the problem.

In that sense, Bitcoin is technically superior because it's solving problems that all others will only have in the future. From a technology stand-point, the race isn't even a close one. ",1524643921
"This is what disturbs me about the BCH community... it has a ton of smart people in it, but in order to make sense in their arguments they have to resort to conspiracy theories with no evidence behind them to patch up holes in their arguments against Bitcoin. For example, what power would blockstream have to get Bitcoin users to use their hub to collect fees? Not to mention, routing on LN uses the path that costs the least amount to the users.  So it's completely free market, meaning transaction fees will likely always stay at 1 satoshi (if not free)

Not only that, if money is the sole motivator, miners are always going to make more money than hub operators. People think that because BCH is so cheap, Bitcoin miners are always going to make more in fees. This is complete nonsense. If BCH ever gets any type of real adoption, the blocksizes could be literally a million times bigger than the average Bitcoin block. 2 cents x 1,000,000 transactions means a block reward for transactions alone equaling $20,000. Compare that to Bitcoin, where the average fee would have to be ~$10 to make up the difference. Not only is 2 cents EXTREMELY conservative as an average fee for BCH transactions in the future (Roger says a fee market is coming eventually), Bitcoin transactions will never get to $10/transaction over a long period once LN is fully functioning and all upgrades, such as Schnorr signatures, are implemented. Segwit is already a big help.",1524643900
"Crypto is a huge thread against PayPal. Denial will be their downfall. They choose the strategy offence as their defense strategy. Which will eliminate them in the long run..

"Or doesn't want the money, or keeps it in bitcoin as a show of faith in the currency. I think that's what I gathered from researching about the genesis block",1524643839
"Totally supply indicates a coins potential, low market cap and a low total supply means 1 coin has the capability of rising much higher than a high total supply coin.   
   
E.G. Eth has 99,034,611 total supply.   
Ripple has 99,992,334,929 total supply.  
Now if we take the market cap for bitcoin which is currently $159,708,351,172 we can figure out a coins potential worth if it where to match bitcoins current market cap.
$159,708,351,172 / 99,034,611 = $1612.65, this is the ""potential"" of 1 eth.  
$159,708,351,172 / 99,992,334,929 = $1.59, this is the ""potential"" of 1 ripple.  
  
So basically it's a technique to figure out what your coin could be worth, using the above example it would be pretty silly to buy 1 ripple and expect it to ever be huge profit. However with eth it is possible to buy 1 coin and see a relatively big profit in the future because the supply is much lower. Neither is better than the other (in terms of buying low supply/high supply coins) just note that if you buy into a coin with 1B tokens instead of 100M tokens that you need to own a lot more of them to see the bigger gains (but there also much cheaper so it works out evenly).",1524643801

I don't quite know if I trust in bitcoin anymore. 
In my own opinion it gained it's initial value in being a functional and fast way to send money for dirt cheap. Once it picked up people looked at it as a get rich quick scheme and it blew up. With it congested slow and expensive what gives it value as a currency now? I know about the lightning network but it's fairly complex and optional. I can't see how the vast majority of users can adopt such a complicated system, especially the users who'd be getting mixed up on which bitcoin is which.

"The multi-algo approach of DGB is interesting and something I've mentioned myself in the past as a possibility, however it requires far more from the human beings involved than the ""Bitcoin"" design does and will most likely tend to become just as internally competitive and hierarchical as Bitcoin Cash in the long run.

Nice hash isnt really mining. Your selling your hashing power to buyers. And your not directly selling to Bitcoin miners (SHA256 algo) rather alts' algos to respective buyers. Youd make more mining on a pool, direct bypassing nice hash, for a particular alt based on your hardware. But nice hash will work as you describe. Watch your temps. Dont use their web wallet. Use bitcoin core v0.16 and let it sync with network to the full 165+gb for full blockchain. Make a ""receive"" btc address and use that for nicehash. Try to only use that address for nicehash. If another ""hack"" happens, bail and never look back. The i7 should do well mining monero. Not sure gtx1080tis best route without nicehash but if you try the legacy version of nice hash it should tell you what algo your gpu does best on after benchmark. If you leave bitcoin core up after its fully synced youll also run a full node (as long as your routers firewall port 8333 is open) helping the network. We got less full nodes online than dollars in btcs current price. 1 per IP. And if you got no btc in wallet it really doesnt help at all.

Also, in view of those articles saying Malta is slowly becoming the crypto-capital of the world; guess who's already on Malta ...ICONOMI!

They are far ahead of anyone else looking to do something similar. Maybe the reason why they are not so popular yet is because their trading platform - in it's current form - is not yet allowed in US. But imho you want to have ICN *before* they get onto the US market.

Gnt just released. One of the first ICOs and it has released its beta. Essentially you can rent cloud computing and lend your cpu to work for tokens. You can download the client now and some people have gotten a few jobs per day but this crypto stuff is so new that it‚Äôs still not populating that many tasks. 

There‚Äôs ethereum gambling sites and you can try out funfairs beta with state channels and it just feels like you‚Äôre playing one of those video games at a bar but for real money.

The dai system is cool because you can take a loan out on your own crypto to create dai. It only takes eth as collateral, you put up your eth and you can withdraw dai. After withdrawal, you can use to buy other crypto (essentially on margin) and when you pay back your dai, your eth is unlocked. All this is a smart contract system too so no ID required or account made. Just lock and receive in your own wallet. The spend dai as you want. 

Here‚Äôs my question to you tho - if eth scales with one of its many scaling solutions in the pipeline: raiden, plasma, plasma cash, sharding, and dai remains successful, where is the value of nano or bitcoin or bitcoin cash?

Almost. I'm simply not denying the BCH community the ability to claim that their vision is better representation of bitcoin (as most people in this sub do but some agreed with me) even though personally I'm not convinced and often their tactics are horseshit.

"&gt; When presented with multiple choices, a market with rational actors chooses the best solution, not the ""best solution given the creation constraints"". So, in my humble view, selecting a proposal just because of the fewer changes required is unreasonable.

Fair point. I just think the risk that comes with any protocol change should never be underestimated. I look forward to the May HF while doing nail-biting!

&gt; Your proposal doesn't require any changes to the network rules, which by itself is a great advantage, but as a result it comes with many limitations. It makes perfect sense to try to sell it to the token interested community to see whether it fits their needs or not.

Yes, and that was my intention. Just the simplest thing that could possibly work. I was more interested in extending the potential modes of discussion here. I still think that anything that does involve protocol changes should argue why it is strictly better (and how much) than the status quo.

I am actually one of the conservative status quo folks, so this is why I was also furious at the deliberate rewriting of history regarding on-chain scaling.

But, of course, I am not a Core dev of the recalcitrant variant who's against changes just so that he can stroke his ego. I just think a wider discussion should happen regarding tokens and potential approaches.

I think I got enough people familiar with tokens, more familiar than I am, to at least think about this, like yourself. But I suspect it would make sense to develop this until it can actually be used in some experimental pre-alpha Electron Cash branch or so.

&gt; Counterparty is incredibly simple. If you only consider token issuance and transfer, it's really close to your proposal. If you are interested, it takes 5 mins to read the sections 'Transactions' and 'Send' here.

Thanks, I'll look deeper into this.


&gt; But what happens if malicious actors manage to somehow overload the validators? What if it's truly successful and there are many many token transactions to validate? For no reward, some of the validators might just quit and leave the burden to the rest, until no one is left validating.

Hmm, I still don't get that. The validation rules of my proposal are still tied to proof of work, by embedding everything into BCH transactions and demanding there validity as well. Of course, you can make spam transactions and so forth, but isn't the same true with current bitcoinds and nodes spamming them? By implementing ban rules, one can deal with that, and it seems to be sufficient.

&gt; As a side note, I saw you use Electron cash. Running an ElectrumX server is much more expensive than running a bch/btc node and we simply take it for granted. They have no incentive for that and they are extremely important to support further adoption. What if we really manage to bring 1 billion people to use bch everyday with SPV wallets? 

Yes, and I am not one of the 'give me free shit1!' people.

ElectrumX is written by kyuupichan, correct? I am pretty sure I remember him saying to me in person that he's perfectly fine with some sort of microtransactions / pay for service scheme regarding wallet servers.

And I am as well. Which isn't to say that it is great that folks run them for free now, and obviously, there's quite some work to do to integrate payment channels and / or subscriptions into Electrum servers. Same goes for other servers serving SPV wallets.

Along these lines, I have also stated that I don't think lots of free transactions will be particularly viable with Bitcoin in the future, because why should miners do them forever. I was arguing that fees in the 1..5 $-ct range of purchasing power are likely fine for now and in the foreseeable future. But who knows, I can also imagine them coming down further with data-center-scale full nodes and more technological progress.

&gt; I like it. You've just solved the side chain distribution issue. If you further decide that you don't need the whole transaction structure just to store the token transfer data, you might converge to counterparty.

I have got some more  reading to do :)

"At the height of the last peak ethereum had the highest number of transactions dwarfing every other crypto.

The smart contracts of eth are yielding some cool products. Dai, a stablecoin pegged to 1 USD is available. Throughout the boom and the dip, dai has stayed stable and shown that it works. Dai is essentially a decentralized tether and can be stored in your wallet like any other ethereum token. As a reminder, every erc20 token transfer requires a little bit of eth.

"Interesting quote, thanks.  I don't see how Satoshi explaining we would end up with big server farms necessarily means we need a bigger block-size.  Actually Andreas Antonopoulos makes a very direct argument against increasing the block-size and letting technology catch up with the demand rather than getting caught with our pants down in 5 years committed to an unnecessarily-adapted inefficiency and an uninspiring altcoin that can't even improve on Litecoin at all.

I honestly see the criticisms of Bcash as entirely appropriate and likely not harsh enough.  We're all biased but having a shitcoin named bitcoin while using Bitcoin.com to fool new users with no clue is incredibly reprehensible. 

I don't necessarily agree with the pro-regulation crowd, I think the time will come when people get mad and Bcash goes down but not before movies and documentaries come out profiling the biggest scam in history.  I completely understand people who say ""why let principles get in the way of making money"" and predicting Ver's moves successfully in a profitable way, but I just don't trust him.  I've given them a chance and found astroturfing and a palpable lack of logic nor evidence.

The amazing thing about it is when Bcash gets rekt bitcoin will skyrocket in value because not only do people generally learn about the market en masse when things become ubiquitous but they typically abandon ship when they realize it's sinking.  I think we'll look back on bitcoin at 43% market share as a brief time in history.  The value inherent in 99% of altcoins is incredibly fleeting.

The few real applications, anon-coins &amp; fixed-market-purpose coins (casino, medical, etc) will have a life span and evolve but they were built on bitcoin and gauged by bitcoin.  I hope the new people realize all that as soon as possible, it's an uneasy thing seeing a flow of ignorance followed by anger when they realize what happened.  People are going to be pissed lol.. Is it worth it to get rich and own an island?  You tell me.

"It actually doesn't work both ways.

Bitcoin is a consensus-based protocol. When an alternative protocol that is not compatible with the existing protocol, the alternative is called a fork. BCash is an entirely new protocol that has larger blocks and incompatible with all of the Bitcoin nodes that existed before BCash was invented.

Bitcoin, before BCash existed, continues to be compatible with the thousands of Bitcoin nodes that worked and still work today despite all the changes that allowed for new features to be introduced.

On top of that, the 400+ developers that worked to build what Bitcoin is before BCash existed, continue to develop on what Roger and other scammers call ""Core"". There is no ""Core"", it's just Bitcoin.

The alternative, BCash, is a fork and a phishing scheme intended to deceive unsuspecting users. There are many fraud attacks on Bitcoin that are not related to Bitcoin. Just like there are scams on Ebay or Facebook, there are many in the Bitcoin world.

As problematic as they are, there are two advantages that Bitcoin have over BCash. And that is, technical superiority in the form of incredible developers, and the internet - where fraud schemes get exposed and ridiculed in the long run. That includes the banking system, corrupt government programs, etc. as long as people are diligent. Information is so easy to find these days, and illogical or inferior arguments will get crushed over time.

and calling

*Bitcoin* -&gt; *Bitcoin Core (BTC)*

really gets confusing, and obfuscates our efforts as *Bitcoin Cash* supporters to establish the legitimacy and soundness of our coin.

1. Not everyone accept one currency. There are multiple currencies in the world. For example if I had USD and I went to Indonesia I wouldn't be able to use it. I would need to convert it to IDR just as I would need to convert BTC to IDR. ,1524640424
"One thing you shouldn't forget: there's 1500+ coins, 90%+ of them pretty much covering the same basic concept/use case. As it stands, most of these coins are grossly overvalued. I mean look at it realistically: there's coins out there that are worth 100's of millions (or billions) that have no actual value. That's worth more than actual huge companies with value in real estate/brands/customer database, etc.

I personally strongly believe that most of these 1500 coins will go to 0 sooner or later. This could happen in 1, 3 or 5 years - who knows, but it WILL happen. Because there's no reason to have 100's of different coins who do the same thing: transfer money from Wallet A to Wallet B. And if there will be 100's of coins for this, they wouldn't all be worth 100's of millions (or even billions).

And this is where, for me, IOTA comes in. If IOTA actually becomes an industry standard (and it's looking very promising in that regard, there's no other crypto with as much of a foot in the door as IOTA), then not only will it definitely be one of those 1500's coin that will survive, but then 5 Billion market cap is actually small.

So yes, you are right: as long as this crypto bubble (and dont kid yourself, it is a speculative bubble for 99% of the coins) keeps going, you will most likely make the same gains in a lot of other coins. But once that bubble bursts, a lot of those coins will be worthless and IOTA (hopefully...) will be alive and kicking. Just like after the dotcom Bubble, companies like Amazon/Google survived and grew to be bigger than before the bust. And that you can only achieve if you have actual real world use cases that are more than just sending value from Wallet A to Wallet B.

Literally have more utility in my city than Bitcoin if your intention is to make a purchase, so I suppose.

What I am describing is the Bitcoin ecosystem. You're not paid in it; you can't pay your rent in it; you can't pay your mortgage with it; you can't buy groceries with it; you can't buy everyday needs items with it. The handful of merchants that currently take bitcoin doesn't *hold* them as Bitcoin because its volatility makes it a liability, which means they use an intermediary to extract their money... much like the traditional banking sector. And if you want to go and purchase Bitcoin (from your pay), you need to go to an intermediary to convert your dollars to internet pesos. And if you then want to pay your mortgage with a bitcoin, you need to go to an intermediary to convert your internet pesos to dollars. Each of these steps attracts fees and takes more time than existing banking infrastructure, which makes statements like this:

&gt; Sender &gt; bank &gt; money &gt; payment system 1 &gt; payment system 2 &gt; international payment system 1 &gt; ... &gt; sticky tape &gt; bank &gt; receiver.

So as crypto prices go up, more and more businesses will accept it and more people will use it as currency. ",1524640139
