"So far I've only used BTC for relatively large purchases and sales of 1 or half a Bitcoin each. I'd still use the blockchain if I were to buy a house, but I don't see a second layer for small daily transactions like coffee or a pair of sneakers as a big problem.

"**M-Pesa**

M-Pesa (M for mobile, pesa is Swahili for money) is a mobile phone-based money transfer, financing and microfinancing service, launched in 2007 by Vodafone for Safaricom and Vodacom, the largest mobile network operators in Kenya and Tanzania. It has since expanded to Afghanistan, South Africa, India and in 2014 to Romania and in 2015 to Albania. M-Pesa allows users to deposit, withdraw, transfer money and pay for goods and services (Lipa na M-Pesa) easily with a mobile device.

The service allows users to deposit money into an account stored on their cell phones, to send balances using PIN-secured SMS text messages to other users, including sellers of goods and services, and to redeem deposits for regular money.

"So . . . I'm actually an economist, and am well aware of the issues concerning deflation.  
  
To be clear, I am not arguing that it will become a national currency, i.e. replacing the USD or EUR for instance.  
  
But, I do believe that a crypto currency (whether it is bitcoin or another one) will become a means of payment (once volatility drops).  
  
Or a 'currency' becomes an alternate asset class, but again with low volatility, and being used as a means of payment.  
  
But as to the 'deflationary' issue, I have often thought about this. Inflation pushes us to spend now, sure (in simplistic terms). And yes, in a deflationary paradigm there is a push to spend later. *BUT* and for me there is a big but. If the entire system is deflationary, people cannot delay purchasing indefinitely. If I need a car . . . I may hold off a month, or a year . . . but what, I will wait 50yrs? House? If I need a shirt, or a new suit, will I wait forever to purchase it?  
  
My belief is, that the delayed spending related to deflation, is when it takes place within a paradigm of inflation. But if the dominant paradigm is deflation, people will be forced to spend out of need.  
  
The truth of the matter is, we have never 'tested' (for obvious reasons) a deflationary paradigm and seen how the system adjusts. 
  
Also . . . the truth of a fixed-growth-rate money supply, as suggested by Friedman, is in and off itself, not entirely deflationary. Rather, it allows for periods of inflation and deflation, as prices fluctuate around the growth of money supply. So some areas of the economy will show inflation, others deflation.  
  
I am not aware of any literature which purports to show or prove (even theoretically) that a fixed-growth money supply leads to overall and constant deflation? ",1523516323

" I concur with @adun-d. Just because something has been around for years doesn't mean it is the best choice. As I have posted elsewhere, Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and has been around for many years. However, where is its mass adoption by major retailers, companies, etc.? When you think about it, the only mainstream adoption Bitcoin has is that of serving as the de-facto base/exchange currency at a majority of crypto exchanges. Bitcoin has, what I like to call, ""sporadic boutique"" retail usage here and there, but nothing noteworthy after 10 years in the game. Let me put it this way. If Bitcoin's network is so magnificent then why don't we hear of its worldwide domination of fiat currency etc.?? Let me be clear, I'm not bashing Bitcoin. Like I've stated elsewhere the blockchain technology that gave rise to Bitcoin has ushered in a whole new industry around digital securities/assets allowing the transfer of digital property/value, such that the transfer is guaranteed to be safe and secure. It's just laughable to see so many clinging to this delusional fantasy of how Bitcoin and its new and improved ""Lightning Network"" it is going to solve the scaling and exploding transactional cost problems. The truth is that there is a huge misunderstanding that unlimited scaling (via the new Lightning Network) will solve all Bitcoin's problems. Because every open/close of an LN channel means an expansion in transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, causing the bottleneck shifts from a limit on the transactions that can be processed on-chain to a bottleneck on how many payment channels can be opened or closed at any given time. It's important to remember that Lightning doesn't allow instant settlement of funds. That means that you can't spend lightning funds until the lightning channel has been closed and the final state transmitted to the blockchain. Effectively what lightning does is allow a massive increase in the capacity for changing ownership of BTC but the BTC doesn't ""move"" until the channel closes. This means that if more than 7 channels want to close per second you will once again get lag.

With respects to Ethereum's broad adoption, which is primarily from ICOs, the question I have is how many of those ICOs are going to fail as a result of no defined use-case, lack of vision and focus, poor leadership, etc. I believe while this a-la-carte ICO market has been very lucrative for Ethereum in the short-term it may ultimately cause its downfall. The fact that Ethereum has yet to find a viable solution to the network’s scaling and technical issues is still the ELEPHANT in the room (https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-time-highs-overshadow-wave-technical-issues/). It is evident that Vitalik realizes that a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus model is not robust or dynamic enough to scale appropriately. He has recently started a ‘scalability initiative’ in attempts to solicit help from the broader developer community to assist with Ethereum’s scalability issues caused by the ever backlog of Cryptokitties, Etherbots, and ICOs clogging the network (https://blog.ethereum.org/2018/01/02/ethereum-scalability-research-development-subsidy-programs/). According to Vitalik, scaling Ethereum’s network “is the single most important key technical challenge that developers need to work on before blockchain applications can be widely used.” The folks at Ethereum have even gone as far as changing the consensus model from a PoW to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) strategy called Casper (https://www.coindesk.com/ethereums-big-switch-the-new-roadmap-to-proof-of-stake/). However, as has been pointed out in Ripple’s new whitepaper regarding the newly proposed XRP-Consensus Ledger replacement consensus: 'Cobalt: BFT Governance in Open Networks,' there are inherent flaws with a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus model (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.07240.pdf Pgs: 10-11).  

In addition to the ICO/Tokens that plague ETH network that I mentioned earlier, you have the resurgence of Ripple’s smart contract platform called Codius that will be revamped and rolled-out this year. According to Stefan Thomas (Ripple’s CTO) who said in a Quora Q&amp;A session (https://www.quora.com/session/Stefan-Thomas-1/1), “I worked on Ripple’s smart contract system Codius back in 2013–2015. Back then, our conclusion was that a viable smart contracts ecosystem requires a standard for payments first. Contracts need to be reviewed to be trusted and that’s expensive if you need a new contract for each type of asset because every ledger has a different protocol/API. Thus, Interledger was born.” Smart contracts have been the backbone and life-blood of Ethereum’s existence for the better part of the past +3 years. I think we can expect great things for Codius especially since it will be built on Ripple’s Interledger Protocol. While Ripple might not have had sufficient “bandwidth” to fully commit to Codius development early on, due to the focus on the development of its blockchain solutions (xCurrent/xRapid/xVia/ILP), it is my belief that they have been quietly working on it behind the scenes for a while now.",1523516140

"&gt;This is a new one on me, can you explain what you mean by this?

the 1MB limit in the block is for the economic coins layer the 21M.

the Segregated Signature layer is the ownership layer. 

the old Bitcoin V0.12 Bitcoin nodes see segwit blocks as just the ""economic coins layer the 21M"" those blocks are missing the Segregated Signature layer.

it is possible to move coins without a signature and fool old Bitcoin nodes. like wise if all miners agree to keep the economic blockchain consistent they can call agree to move coins without a signature (think government garnishing order as part of an ALM treaty.) Coinbase and Bitpay are not going to protect child pornography or terrorists so they just ignore the missing signatures (soft fork them out) and the economic majority follow the miners and industry leaders. 

Peter-R describes it here: https://youtu.be/hO176mdSTG0?t=1m30s

&gt; i mean the actual developers contributing to BTC.

they are a small group of programmers, they ignore economists, designers, sociologists and academics.  Developers at lease the ones employed to work on Bitcoin have not expressed an intuitive understanding of the incentive design of bitcoin. Technical they should have very little influence and be doing what the investors and the miners tell them to do, they should not be in control of anything.

"Exactly, scalability and regulations will be key here. Ripple's XRP is where I'm putting my money. That is not to say that BTC or ETH won't have a seat at the table, but XRP is a juggernaut just itching to break-out. Most give Ripple/XRP a lot of shade: it's centralized, no bank will use its digital asset, etc. Ripple is a long-term play. They are steadily building the infrastructure via xCurrent, xVia, and the Interledger Protocol (ILP) that will ultimately propel them beyond BTC and ETH. Just the concept of ILP alone is amazing. 


Very few blockchain companies have built the ecosystem more than Ripple with regards to increasing interoperability among platforms in this space. “In almost any other company, it would be a hard sell to the executive staff to spend time creating an innovation that would be freely available to anybody – even competitors. But Ripple is not a normal type of company; Ripple looked beyond the narrow thinking of “idea ownership” and knew that it had stumbled onto a concept that could transform an entire industry""—(Quote from @Hodor: https://xrphodor.wordpress.com/2017/07/11/the-interledger-protocol-a-bigger-pie-for-everybody/).” What the Interledger Protocol (ILP) does is break down those “walled-gardens” or “restricted” Distributed Ledgers (DLTs) (like: Hyperledger, R3 Consortium, Quorum, DAH) creating an extremely competitive landscape by leveling the playing field for all crypto-currencies and DLTs, so that each will have to stand on their own code/blockchain technology. This is so revolutionary and speaks volumes as to Ripple’s confidence in their blockchain technology (xCurrent/xRapid/xVia/ILP/Codius) that they are able and willing to give their competitors (Bitcoin, Ether, Stellar, etc.) a fair chance to prove their worth in the marketplace as this blockchain revolution develops. This altruistic act underscores the principled character of the leadership behind Ripple and their dedication to seeing the growth and evolution of the Internet-of-Value (IoV). They could’ve very well have patented ILP’s technology charging a fee to all other DLT/Smart Contract (SC) platforms and hence make a fortune in the process. However, they knew that the influence of the Internet came from the fact that it served as a gateway to connect everyone. The Internet can accomplish this because it is not a single network or system but a network of networks with information being sent across multiple platforms using open-source proprieties. This allows communication across the Internet to be seamless irrespective of what provider people are associated with. Ripple understood the same way the open-source TCP/IP protocol gave rise to the greatest economic stimulus/engine the world has ever known in the Internet, the same principles needed to be applied to ILP in order to see their vision for the IoV to come to fruition. The leadership at Ripple understood that ILP was the “rising tide to lift all boats” not just XRP. I recommend watching this insightful Talks at Google Forum with Chris Larsen (Chairman-Ripple) and Stefan Thomas (CTO-Ripple) as they can explain it far better than I can: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7Tiz3JQeYc.",1523513653
Not sure but you can look up to around 0.166 BTC to your LN channel.,1523513534
"&gt; what bitcoin is really doing.
&gt; 
&gt; And what is it doing?

It's the prototype for a new kind of digital social contract. One that creates a commodity money and is powered by cryptosystem and the very real energy it takes to both mint units of bitcoin, and secure the system. 

&gt;Apolitical money is and has always been a goal of the market fundamentalists - of the right. Because governments are potentially democratic, and can thus be potentially responsible to the demands of the masses, the ultra rich and the people who draw income from capital have always been fearful of the consequences to their income stream because of it.

And yet here you are advocating that my lot is better thrown in with Jeff Bezos and the fascist war-machine state than with Satoshi Nakamoto. The state and capitalism have fused into a single object--this potentiality for democracy to bring the beast to heel was liquidated long ago; capital reigns supreme and it is the state who makes sure we mind the master. 

&gt;Therefore they've advocated for apolitical money outside of the control of the state, regulated by some sort of mythical 'closed loop' system (see the old price-species flow mechanism) or by commodity money. The gold standard was one such experiment in apolitical money. Its failure and deflationary tendencies are some of the reasons why we got the Depression and Hitler.

Bitcoin is a commodity-money, but it is not apolitical. No money is apolitical. Even gold was and still is political, which is why there was the whole silver democrats movement in the late 19th century, and subsequently the creation of the federal reserve after the panic of 1907. This is not by the failure of gold as a commodity-money, but by the capturing of it and oligopolization of it through the banking system. The later failure we see of fractional banking systems around the world in the 1930s was also not the fault of gold as money, but the banking systems. 

&gt;Bitcoin is nothing new in this respect. There's no way this system of money can accommodate an advanced industrial society. No way. Which is why it is prone to the same problems which plagued other similar schemes in the past. 

Yes it is, and because you fail to see this as anything new, you also fail to see how a design like this can enable a totally new money system, and political agreements. Bitcoin is now just one of hundreds of projects built on blockchain technology, which all have various potentials as money, but more importantly social contracts. 

&gt;Deflation hits the poor and the working class the worst of all. This is not a left solution but a very old market fundamentalist's dream masquerading as something new and novel under a 'hip' silicon valley costume.

Real deflation in fractional reserve fiat money systems do hit the poor and working class the hardest. Bitcoin is not a fraction reserve money system, but a commodity-money. This same reason why monetary inflation would be a bad thing within the bitcoin ecosystem. Again, you don't seem to understand bitcoin as a money system so I can see why you would believe this is just a techie masquerade. Believe me, it is not. 

&gt;Its not killing money. Its substituting the current - horribly imperfect, horribly skewed towards the rich - system of money for an even worse system.

If we were going for just bitcoin, perhaps you would be right. But were not. There are now thousands of different crypto assets, all working towards the common goal of creating new forms of social and economic agreements.   

&gt;He attacks transactions fees, but fails to look at solutions like the lightning network.

&gt;&gt;Please explain this.

"Hi there, I can't do a normal post because I don't fully understand karma apparently.

The world economy became stagnant, banks don't give enough incentive to save money, debt is worth more than stocks, uncertainty everywhere etc...

Crypto as a economic tool has brought liquidity to the world, Africa is getting some and by getting money there investors are building and improving the situation of the population over there.

Venezuela, Argentina, Brasil, México I'd like to see what are the volumes of cryptos being sold there and the volume of cryptos purchased at first world countries... The thing is most of this money is floating from point A and exiting on point B, apparently bitcoin is gathering fed up people who is holding, who thinks there is potentially a better savings account, but the reality is we don't know anything, non of these different assets ensure you of storing nor improving your value, the gamble on btc is that the community will be strong enough to hold for the next 30 40 years and will increase in value with the passing by cash enough to ensure that most of the buyers will have a balanced life after this, probably hopijg/betting that the same people will raise their kids with the same philosophy, son you will buy this coin your whole life in order to allow the past generation to get a worthy retirement...

Só this is my ideal theory behind btc... And I think it's hard to get enough people to live by the same motto... Even with the most followed religions there are differences, we as humans differ from other species because we don't think on our offspring first apparently... Nor in our own future, we are selfish and egocentric and because of this I'm betting on xrp, apparently there's a lot of hate on xrp... But I don't get it, they've donated enough money to have a third world country improve a shit ton... They have worked to be regulated and have signed already with enough banks to move the volume they are moving right now... It's not decentralized you'd say... Well yeah... I want a centralized coin... I want rules and the possibility to get my money back in case of a scam, even the best countries have a government my dear friends because no one can know enough of all the variables we fight with everyday and experts are needed, and if Google decided to place money somewhere I think it's intelligent to follow along after making your homework...

Btc is centralized, because of mining, ether is centralized because of Vitalik but it seems it's best to make it look like it's not? I rather gamble my money on the coin that specifically states that is centralized and will work towards decentralization (because it's cheaper ofc they're a company after all)...

I'm reading on vchain as well, anything that can help with counterfeit products online and help big box stores with their stock management and supply chain has a future... Iota seems cool too but I haven't read enough on these two to gamble on them right now...

I want to know If theres a coin working towards drm on games? I'd like to gamble on that too...

"**Value chain**

A value chain is a set of activities that a firm operating in a specific industry performs in order to deliver a valuable product or service for the market. The concept comes through business management and was first described by Michael Porter in his 1985 best-seller, Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance.



The idea of the value chain is based on the process view of organizations, the idea of seeing a manufacturing (or service) organization as a system, made up of subsystems each with inputs, transformation processes and outputs. Inputs, transformation processes, and outputs involve the acquisition and consumption of resources – money, labour, materials, equipment, buildings, land, administration and management.

"I don't think it's necessarily JUST Blockstream. I think at this point it's basically every company exclusively working on BTC. And that was the point I was trying to make with this post. 

There's a serious misalignment of incentive on the BTC side right now.  Because BTC has committed to not increasing the block size, the companies that have decided to stick with BTC ONLY (Not necessarily for companies that support both) are only those whose business model is aligned with that reality.

And that reality is do it outside of the chain, and if you're going to do it off the chain, and you're a company whose goal is to make money, you will do your best to make sure the value is mostly extracted off the chain. 

And the danger is in this reality where the very developers who have commit access to the BTC project itself are those who need to make money by undermining BTC's value as much as possible. Sure they may make money if BTC's value goes up, but these companies are mostly venture funded companies that needs to exit, so they can't liquidate based on BTC's value alone, they need to generate revenue. And the best way to generate revenue and capture the value is through centralized means.

So it's not just Blockstream per se. Lightning (the company) has the same problem. And probably everyone else who's exclusively working on BTC side and have the commit access rights to BTC have the same problem.

For the average user - yes. Lightning Network will take care of this for typical transactions.

For miners - Maybe. Segwit is definitely an efficiency improvement for chainwork. LN allows a day, week, month, year, or lifetime's worth of transactions to bundle into a single on-chain tx fee.

This allows for 1,000tx's to share a single tx fee. $50/1000 = $0.05/tx + ln fees ultimately, while having $14,544,000/day in tx fees available to the miners.

"Bitcoin tests a lot of differing philosophies at the same time. 

I think of *""Greed, for the lack of a better word, is good.""*

There's no right or wrong way to use bitcoin. It does not have a purpose, just like a rock does not have a purpose except for the way that we *choose* to use it, which gives it purpose. Even if it *is/was* intendend for one thing, if someone uses it differently, that's cool too. Nobody's evil for that one time they use a car key to open a paper envelope. Not the intended use, but hell, it works.

Hodlers have their place like anyone else that uses BTC in other ways. ",1523510884

"&gt;the supply of bitcoin IS fixed (less those that are lost), but not all of them are yet claimed.

Yes, this is a valid model in some ways, but it also might tempt you towards some false conclusions in some contexts. For instance, if you're thinking in terms of a completely fixed supply (i.e. taking the model to the extreme), and suddenly hundreds of thousands of DPR coins are seized and auctioned off to the market, you might want to say ""oh those coins won't have an effect on the price, because supply didn't really increase, they were there all along!"" This is naive, and demonstrates that when it comes to evaluating price (and its potential movement) it is important to distinguish between *circulating* or *available supply* and *total supply*; the former is inflationary, the latter (perhaps mildly) deflationary... and the former is the relevant figure.

&gt;A correct understanding of monetary economics would be a cohesive explanation of what money's function is and what attributes make one currency better than another, as well as an ability to predict what the outcome of currency competition in a market.

Again, if your prerequisite includes that this prediction is correct, this is a (perhaps impossibly) high bar to set.

&gt;You on the other hand, seem to be a clown that makes a bunch of price predictions

Let's be clear here: most of my predictions do not necessarily concern the price (at least not directly). Stuff like ""Segwit will lock in on mainnet before August 1"", ""Craig Wright won't provide signatures using Satoshi's private keys despite his promises to do so"", ""2x won't take over and kill the original chain"" and other similar contextually-relevant arguments make up the majority of my ""prediction portfolio"", and price-related ones are a tiny fraction of it.

&gt;and because of survivor bias think that price action validates your stated reasons, even though you are not able to show causality

Again, it's not always (or even ""usually"") price action that validates what I say. And while you're (mostly) correct that it's usually impossible to ""prove causality beyond a doubt"", in every case I'm willing to expound thoroughly on my reasoning and logic, discuss and consider opposing perspectives (and explain the specifics of why I ultimately disagree with them), and lay out my thoughts in advance of the event(s) in question. When dozens and dozens of these sorts of arguments have their conclusions proven true over the months and years as virtually *none* of them are proven false, despite the fact that in every case a significant chunk of people disagreed with me at the time, it's hard to seriously argue that this is ""survivorship bias and nothing else""; the logic is there, laid-out and visible to the world, and well-defended when the situation calls for it. Ignore or dismiss this all you want, but realize you're just (ironically) proving me correct in the process.

&gt;I predict it is very likely we will see prices north of $100k within the next 4 years BECAUSE OF THE TRANSIT OF MERCURY.

Okay, I'm willing to hear out your full argument here. Why, exactly, do you think Mercury's transit will have this specific effect on Bitcoin's price? Have you backtested historical market data and found a convincing correlation? Do you have *any* supportive arguments whatsoever? Or is this just ""a gut feeling""?

Note: I'm not arguing that your conclusion will prove incorrect (though if four years go by and the price stays below $100k, I do think it would be fair to count this as an example of ""you being wrong""). Though you don't have an impressive track record that I am aware of and have not demonstrated particularly strong reasoning skills thus far in our discussion, I withhold judgment on the quality of the argument/prediction entirely until I've heard the details behind it.",1523510489

"I address most of these points in the post I linked.
The point is not driving construction nor do I expect mining to one day end; the point is that a renewable energy grid that can handle peak demands even during averse weather has to have massive overcapacity (local, temporary and seasonal). Mining will ensure that remains affordable, that we can have solar panels and wind turbines that the grid only needs like 10-20% of the time.

I also challenge that coal is cheaper than renewable energy; it isnt. If you dont need 24/7 supply, then per KwH solar and wind is cheaper than any carbon based source. Even quatar finds its cheaper to use solar panels than their own gas. The problem with renewables is that they are intermittent and local. Storing and transporting energy is much more expensive than actually producing it; but for crypto mining that is not a problem, you can mine locally and intermittently.

&gt;mining operations have no incentive to go green 

They have the best possible incentive: nothing is cheaper than green energy, at the source. In fact, the price of green energy is frequently **negative**. Again I refer you to my other reddit post.",1523509621

"There is one thing that persists in my mind, about the split.  The fork was brought about due to the notion that Bitcoin was monopolized by a singular entity, which Bitcoin's main function of decentralization was supposed to prevent.  The creation of a fork, by a group of people, is groundwork for the same scenario to happen again with BCH in the future.  So another contentious fork from BCH would be in the cards.  But it's ok if that's what you anticipate.

If we look at it in the context that BTC and BCH, and their forks, are important to each other for the sake of decentralized interests, then they could strengthen each other.  Stand together or fall apart...

"&gt; what bitcoin is really doing. 

And what is it doing?

&gt;Yes it is! Through the state's monopoly of the monetary system and legal privileges they give to banks, they directly engage in our exploitation.

Apolitical money is and has always been a goal of the market fundamentalists - of the right.  Because governments are potentially democratic, and can thus be potentially responsible to the demands of the masses, the ultra rich and the people who draw income from capital have always been fearful of the consequences to their income stream because of it.  Therefore they've advocated for apolitical money outside of the control of the state, regulated by some sort of mythical 'closed loop' system or by commodity money.  The gold standard was one such experiment of apolitical money.  Its failure and deflationary tendencies are some of the reasons why you had the Depression and Hitler. 

Bitcoin is nothing new in this respect.  There's no way this system of money can accommodate an advanced industrial society.  No way.  Which is why it is prone to the same problems which plagued other similar schemes in the past.  Deflation hits the poor and the working class the worst of all.  This is not a left solution but a very old market fundamentalist's dream masquerading as something new and novel under a 'hip' mask.  

&gt; There is a powerful answer for the Left with bitcoin and crypto assets, and it is through destroying capitalism by killing money itself.

Its not killing money.  Its substituting the current - horribly imperfect, horribly skewed towards the rich - system of money for an even worse system.  

&gt;He attacks transactions fees, but fails to look at solutions like the lightning network. 

Please explain this.  

&gt;Then he builds himself a nice straw man argument about bitcoin users bearing unreasonable internal and external transactions cost

I think he's very clear on this.  You're talking about something that would add transaction costs normally unavoidable but limited to international transactions to *all* domestic transactions... on both sides of the ledger.  How is this novel, new, or desirable?

"The author doesn't understand bitcoin. 

His failure to see the relationship between the electrical cost of mining and how that secures the network, along with how the ownership of bitcoin units are controlled with private keys mean he oversees the importance of what bitcoin is really doing. 

He attacks transactions fees, but fails to look at solutions like the lightning network. Then he builds himself a nice straw man argument about bitcoin users bearing unreasonable internal and external transactions cost, and how this makes an untenable system.

What pisses me off is this part:

""For the Left, there is no reason to regret Bitcoin’s failure. Its critique of the monetary system is not our critique... Socialists understand that the state’s monetary architecture is designed to maintain the stability of a system marked by inequality and alienation, but is not itself the cause of those things.""

Yes it is! Through the state's monopoly of the monetary system and legal privileges they give to banks, they directly engage in our exploitation. 

There is a powerful answer for the Left with bitcoin and crypto assets, and it is through destroying capitalism by killing money itself.",1523505971

"&gt;But I would think that the fact that there are more searches than there was before indicates that there is now a larger userbase. The long term growth in userbase is what is more important than spikes in attention.

Sort of, but not really.

The huge interest in BTC during the Q4 run up made much of the developed world aware of BTC. People's interest spiked and a *lot* of people poured money into it. Then, for whatever reason you opt to believe, the bubble popped and the price fell almost as dramatically as it rose.

Now, we're ""post bubble"" and waiting on the next bull run, but since BTC isn't like a stock or bond that has a functional return, the bull run will only happen when more new money comes back into the system. Right now, it's apparent that people are no longer in a hurry to put their money in, which means the demand for BTC is largely static and the price won't move much, save for those cliffs caused by bots.",1523505865

&gt; They are ideologically opposed against anything off-chain

I replied that that is no true and that we just wanted the network to remain a reliable and affordable network for payments, which does not work with a 1 MB block size limits  as we have seen.

You never engaged in the dialogue, you never had any argument. You started ranting about Roger Ver as if he had anything to do with what I was posting. As if there are no people that can think for themselves and come to the same conclusions outside of Roger Ver. 

Then I talked about how /r/bitcoin is a cult, where there is no room for thought or ideas.

Haha, I want to see you put in a complain with reddit for people using alt account to evade ban on /r/bitcoin. You guys break way more rules on reddit and you have banned so many people that each time you have to go to the reddit admins complaining about ban evading that you would not have time for anything else but doing that all day.

Why don't you unban me and allow me to engage in dialogue again under my main account. Because you have unbanned me unfairly. Me editing a post, correcting my grammar, adding a couple of lines of text. 90% of my posts are like that. That's not a reason to ban me. That's how I write stuff. I don't remove lines, I add a couple to make my point more clear. Reddit does not have a preview function, it should but it does not. 

You have banned me unfairly. And you have no valid arguments. ",1523505711

"I don't see a reason to believe that. I can see a reason to wish thinking that though.

The problem with Bitcoin as a currency is that it is a deflationary asset. While that is a strength for maintaining value, it is a very negative factor for anything hoping to serve as a currency, as it discourages spending. It becomes more advantageous to hold the asset vs. spend the asset. The scarcity actually discourages spending, which causes it to not function like a currency. As difficulty rises, this is only going to get worse, not better as you suggest. The incentive to hold, not spend, is only going to increase as difficulty rises.

In this way, the inflationary nature of fiat is superior. Bitcoin is more like a precious metal than it is a currency. There is a place for this, but not in commerce.",1523505493

"How are the calculations inaccurate? Here's what you said:
&gt;So if BTC/ETH goes down, all alt-coins are going down. There will always be a correlation. Measures like this typically do not take this into account and calculate the correlation as if they're dealing with stocks.

The chart posted shows empirical evidence that they're *not* strongly correlated in most cases. What is your evidence to the contrary? How would these calculations be adjusted to ""take this into account""? Even if the price of an alt in fiat is derived in two parts, first from the price of alt to btc/eth and then btc/eth to fiat, what does that matter? You can still easily look up the price of alts in fiat, and from there it's pretty straightforward to calculate the correlation between alt to fiat price and btc/eth to fiat price.",1523504813

These are both the best ways I have found to take advantage of the volatile crypto world. The more volatile, the better when you’re on the side of the market as a lendor. The same is true with the bot because it mitigates risk and takes advantages of quick spikes. You simply select quality coins (15 minimum) you want to own and the bot buys whatever is dipping and sells when it turns. You end up with a portfolio of growing coins of your choosing.

USD is also guaranteed by the most powerful government on earth and it's value has been relatively stable compared to just about any other commodity since 1913.  Yes, it depreciates in value, so you don't want to use it as a strong store of wealth, which is why you should buy more valuable goods (like stocks, bonds, real estate, 401k's, IRA's, precious metals or bitcoin for instance) with any excess money.

"Now that I've been listening to their talks, some of the Ripple team members are the most tech- and ideology-driven people I've heard in this space - granted, I'm new. 

Their chief cryptographer literally just stumbled across Bitcoin early on and began working with the team on surpassing some of its limitations. 

It's becoming clear what Ripple is attempting with their products are well-governed private services that exist on an open protocol that anybody can use. ILP is the TCP/IP to xVia or xRapid's Twitter or Gmail. Google didn't lock you into using a network connectivity they created in order to use their products, like AOL or Compuserve kinda did.

"The problem with your analogy is the oil has value because of what it can do. 

Bitcoin can’t do anything except represent value. We should therefore spend it as value so it is valued.

It’s simple if you intend to convert future fiat to Bitcoin to hodl but have a use case where you can spend it. Exchange the value you plan to spend in addition to your hodl amount. Spend and hold.

Everyone who wants their unit of account (Bitcoin) to be valued as wealth in the future should use a portion of Bitcoin as an exchange for valuable goods and services. 

If we can’t use Bitcoin in an exchange of value (ie: trade) it can not store value since their is nothing unique about it other then scarcity and security. 

Polished Pope Poo is an example of a scare item that has limited reproduction but are entirely worthless. They may become worth something if I can convince others to use them as a standard unit of account and medium of value transfer. Holding onto my PPP with the expectation that someone else will do something to make them worth Hodling is crazy.

"Hello all, a few people and I have been working on a project to link together different communities of crypto traders. Called the [Crypto Trader Network](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTraderNetwork/wiki/network) (very original, I know..). It has been going well and we're seeing some serious progress/growth. It's similar to the SFWPornNetwork but a lot less rigid, much more informal, and entirely based around creating a resource for traders and bringing together crypto related subreddits. 


The goal is to be a sort of neutral middle-ground for all communities to share. This is one of the reasons why we include both /r/bitcoin and /r/btc as links, despite their quarrels and disagreements. We think that everyone should simply be provided with the resources/information they need to make intelligent trading/investment decisions. There is no advertising, covert shilling, ulterior motives, affiliations. The order in which subreddits appear is not well-thought out or intentional, and is fairly random for now, until we think of a better way of organizing things. 

I am posting here to see what level of interest there is in this project. So far the moderators of around 2 dozen subreddits have agreed to link *back* to the network, including some rather big ones (/r/cryptocurrency, /r/dogecoin, /r/cryptocurrencies, among others). 

The subreddit itself (/r/CryptoTraderNetwork) is still in its infancy, and isn't well-defined in its goal or anything. Originally I was going to leave it blank, but others have been interested in posting information, and trying to make a community/hub of some sort. The main goal is to create and maintain [this page](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTraderNetwork/wiki/network), which simply lists various crypto-related subreddits. That is the page that other subreddits are linking back to, and acts as the central landing page of the network.

I am hoping to gain some support from trading communities such as this one. I'm open to any thoughts/ideas/suggestions/requests/criticism, and I would be grateful for any support that can be given.

"It's unlikely they lost $2mil. In margin trading, you have leverage (the 10x used as an example). So someone could have bet $20k at 100x, allowing them to buy $2mil worth of contracts.  
They could very well have done 1x and not borrowed money, but the liquidation price would be incredibly high - Bitcoin would have to reach $1.3mil each before that short would be liquidated, 2x brings that liquidation price down to $13.5k.  
  
Most people who get REKT during a price movement of $30-$50 is because they used 100x leverage.  
Say if someone shorts $2mil contracts 100x (contributing $20k worth of BTC) at $6950, if the price went down to $6900 and they bought back $2mil closing their short, they would have made over 2BTC in profit. If the price went down to $6800, they'd make over 6BTC in profit.

So if it does break then bounce off 7200 I'll probably buy some ETH and set a tight stop loss.

It blows my mind because at the end of the day, it’s a bank transaction. It doesn’t cost them more money to transact with a crypto counter party than it does with any other counter party. 

Furthermore, Coinbase is transparent with their fees as far as I understand. Are they hiding something more? I doubt it. If they are, I’d be surprised. They take a very decent cut as is.

I also agree that it's unfair for crypto to be neither and both, but banks are just trying minimize risk by charging it as cash.

From what I've heard there are a lot of people who bought thru an exchange on a credit card and then tried to dispute the transaction after the market tanked.

"Not even that, what was said at 1:59 was:

&gt;I think Roger Ver kinda summed it up: ""This project is more than just a company. It's a moment.""

Notice that in that sentence Bitcoin Cash is referenced as a project and a moment, never as a company (the ""project"" is beyond a company, it's a ""movement""). So not only did Calvin Ayre never say ""Bitcoin Cash is more than just a company, it’s a movement"", that wasn't even the quote he was reading.

In all fairness I think coingeek just wanted to work in Bitcoin Cash in the title, which is understandable, and to give the gist of the character interviewed (that Calvin do believe that the Bitcoin Cash project is above anything that is just a company).

After watching the interview ""Calvin Ayre: Bitcoin Cash is more than just a company, it’s a movement"" does make sense even to describe the interview, even though he never actually said that (and it wasn't meant to suggest that BCH is a company itself).

Gotta be careful when writing anything that may look like a quote but is meant to summarize, otherwise people will think words are being put into the mouth of the guy being interviewed.",1523498860

Even that part is fine, everyone has freedom of speech and I respect their opinions, but the real issue is that, as far as I know, most people who work as core developer on the BTC protocol itself are incentivized to think this way because their business model depends on it.

Lightning labs has every incentive to turn crypto into a world with multiple currencies because that's how they can be valuable, by being at the center of everything (instead of as just a ""plugin"" to Bitcoin) Same goes for Blockstream.

"I didn't say they were using xRapid/XRP.  Like I've said in other posts, the segway for Ripple to maximize xRapid adoption and the appreciation of XRP's price will primarily be through their premier blockchain tech solutions: xCurrent or xVia. With xCurrent/xVia FIs are only achieving ~30% in transactional cost savings. Along with xRapid, they can achieve the ~42% in total cost savings Ripple's tech will provide them (See: https://ripple.com/files/xrp_cost_model_paper.pdf Pgs: 7-10). Bankers are capitalistic creatures. It wouldn't make sense for them not to take full advantage of all cost-saving measures available to them. However, you have to crawl before you can walk. When you go to purchase a new car, you don't just randomly pick the first one you see. You test drive it, look at different models, brands, etc. Same thing here, banks are trialing/using the foundational blockchain tech (xCurrent or xVia) first. It's not that Ripple isn't promoting xRapid, they are (i.e. Western Union, MoneyGram, Cuallix, MercuryFx, IDT, etc.). The primary reasons we have yet to see mainstream adoption and usage of XRP/xRapid among banks/FIs is that the crypto market lacks institutional-grade hedging, custody instruments, and a defined regulatory framework to help them mitigate risk associated with the volatility. Miguel Vias, Head of XRP Markets at Ripple, offered some insights as to Ripple's plans for its XRP holdings for 2018 in the 2017 Q4 XRP Markets Report: ""While customers can use XRP for on-demand liquidity through xRapid, we want to build the necessary market infrastructure for eventual direct usage of XRP by financial institutions. In Q1, we'll begin work towards the launch of institutional hedging instruments and custody solutions. Both of these market components are important to institutional adoption and thus are important components of our 2018 roadmap."" You also have to remember that Ripple's clients (banks, FIs, Central Banks, etc.) are some of the most conservative in the space. Plus, they have to work within the confines of strict regulatory standards (i.e. AML, KYC, CFT). Due to the premature regulatory framework along with the aforementioned liquidity, custody, and hedging issues that exist in the crypto markets, Ripple had the foresight to know that adoption of XRP/xRapid among their particular clientele would be slow, hence xCurrent and xVia were developed. There is nothing controversial with xCurrent or xVia as they are doing the same thing as SWIFT + their correspondent banking partners by solving the settlement issue (i.e. communication/traceability/accountability/settlement) of FIAT payment transfers between banks, but better, faster, more secure, etc. The controversial piece for banks is the adoption of Ripple's digital asset (xRapid/XRP) for liquidity. Someone posted this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEuNI_ZTXHs video with Miguel Vias fielding questions about XRP and Ripple's future endeavors. I recommend watching the exchange as it is very insightful (especially from 16:00 to 30:00).",1523496914

"In countries that don't properly price in the environmental cost of coal (like my home country - Australia), there is no cheaper energy than dirty coal power.

Mining bitcoin is a bit like buying a new apartment block. There's an environmental cost, but investors don't care about environmental costs. They will do it as long as the rental returns cover the construction and ongoing costs. It's up to governments to ensure that the environmental costs are correctly passed on to the investors.

Solar may eventually become cheaper than coal on its own, but the only way it's cheaper _right now_ is if governments, as representatives of the people, make coal artificially expensive to account for the environmental cost.

Mining bitcoin a pretty direct way of turning power into cash; so it's kind of a new problem. But Bitcoin Mining isn't the root cause of the issue, it's a symptom. The root cause is power (carbon) pricing.

My biggest (current) problem with PoS is that while all this noise is made about it fixing the environmental problems of PoW - the only way PoS can seem to work is as a hybrid system (PoW + PoS) .... which means we're right back to square 1 and running PoW for blockchain integrity.",1523496654

"Say it's January 4th and you see the price of BTC and ETH around 20k and 1400 respectively. You watch as the rally runs out of steam and you think to yourself ""goddamn we're about to crash HARD"". So you want to somehow make money on things going south. This is what shorting is. Someone lends you an asset and you sell it immediately. You wait for it to go down until you're happy with your profits and then you buy the asset at the lower price and you get to keep the difference. The lender is made whole and you've made a pile of cash.

The biggest caveat of this is that when you go long (expecting prices to go up) you can only lose as much as you put in since the price can only go as low as zero. That's obviously an awful outcome but if you put in $5000 you can only ever lose a max of $5000.

However if you short $5000 of crypto, go to sleep and it's 10x'd overnight (implausible but not impossible), your losses are theoretically unlimited. You need to buy back in at the market price to give the lender back their asset and now you're out $50,000 instead of $5,000.

Margin amplifies this. Margin is a loan given to you. And as with most loans you (A) have to pay them back and (B) have to put up collateral equal in value to the amount of the loan. When the value of that collateral goes the opposite direction of your bet, the person who gave you the loan will eventually do what's known as a margin call and demand you give them more collateral or pay down the difference between the loan amount and the collateral who's value has changed the ""wrong"" way. In most cases this means people just liquidate their position to cover their margin since they're in the red and then usually still end up owing money. Betting with margin on wall street is what leads some people to jump out of buildings when markets crash, so it's really best left alone.",1523495829

In the long run, it's a loss. LN works across chains, so it doesn't require users to buy Bitcoin.

"&gt; Well, at 3 tx/sec it would take the world's 7 billion people a minimum of about 76 years (!) to each make a single on-chain transaction.

There will be approximately 7billion people transacting by then, ;-) but the odds are against  the user as the average lifespan of a money system is around 45 years, and to know you have bitcoin you actually need to close the channel, so that an estimate LOL, is about 152 years before everyone can get their BTC on chain confirmed.

"&gt; You wouldn't target the merchant for the double spend.
Yes, but you don't understand me here. The merchants self-interest is it to not accept anything else than payments though there own node or there choosen and trusted nodes. Nodes that are known for that they are honest miners. Because they can be sure it will get confimed in the blockchain. Because if they exclude any other node like your set up double spend node, they just lose money by allowing potential double spend-0conf txs. So, it's not clever for them to allow all nodes.
If you sending double spends to other nodes that are not known to be honest miners, they easily don't accept your payment after all.
That's why people are trusting Bitpay or recently those new Coinbase Widgets as payments. -&gt; trusted nodes.

I totally see why someone gets the impression it wouldn't be ""censorship resistant"" anymore, if SM get excluded.
The answer is simple: You'll have to stick to the ""consensus"" rules. Be a honest miner and the network and all txs will be censorship resistant. If the network detects that your are attempting double spends (two outputs at the same time), you'll get rejected. This is not censorship. Just make one tx after another. Should be easy for a machine to detect.

And i think if you are a full node miner. Memory space isn't really the issue here: https://www.amazon.com/Sandisk-Ultra-400GB-Adapter-SDSQUAR-400G-GN6MA/dp/B074RNRM2B/ref=sr_1_sc_1/135-6091595-2403802?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1523491645&amp;sr=8-1-spell&amp;keywords=sdd+400gb

400GB MicroSS costs $200 TODAY!
With the volatility of Cryptocurrencies, you will be definitely able to pay for such things with no hassle. 

You need a good machine to mine profitable and have cheap electricity sources as well. This was always the case.

Data memory gets cheaper and cheaper. Until we have full 1GB blocks everyday, we will have 1TB MicroSDs for $50. I promise you that. Cryptocurrencies will force to form the electronic industry. We already seeing that at the moment with Intel and Samsung buliding/planning more efficient ASICs equipment than Bitmain. Soon we will have artificial intelligence mining cryptocurrencies. Mining is competition. Mining is capitalism. That's the cold truth. - You can't mine bitcoin profitable with our old C64.
The only real need is that mining needs to be more energy efficient/energyconsuming.",1523494484

"You need to watch that video before making baseless comments. He specifically states that the blockchain is currently being used. Over 20,000 handbags from a french luxury brand are already on the blockchain as are the entire catalogue of the largest wine importer in China. Let me repeat that, they are already in use. You can go and scan the wine in supermarkets in China now. Once the mainnet launches, they will be moved over to the public blockchain. The amount of confirmed partnerships Ven already has, from several industries, not just supply chain are going to be additional users. He also says that they have a list of over 200 more clients waiting to speak to them after being introduced from PwC and DNVgl. 

You said it will only have supply chain customers using it, the first ICO to launch very soon is BitOcean who operate crypto ATM's in Japan. There's one use case for you. 

The scale of this project is immense, their technology is also great so not sure why you dismissed that. 
Promote ARK all day long and I'll upvote you but don't do it at the expense of another great project, which might deter someone else from looking into it. If you are going to dismiss another project like you did, at least do your research properly.",1523494398
"This is probably because there’s more risk to short bitcoin at 20,000 when its doing so well. There’s less risk now that it is on a downtrend, so people are going to use it to make money. This isn’t an anti bitcoin post, just about risk. ",1523494354
"&gt;Having developers enforce hard fork changes without consensus

What makes you think developer "" enforce hard fork changes without consensus""?  But I agree with you from the standpoint that protocol changes should be more driven by miners not developers.  We're not there yet.

&gt;Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.

Nakamoto consensus works but its not the only tool or a complete solution to the social experiment that is Bitcoin.

&gt;In-fact if mining was really decentralized - we would have 100's of small pools 

I doubt that would ever happen.  You don't get much relief from statistical variance on a sub 1% pool.

"I'm not being bias just stating facts. Ripple has been around for let's say 6 years and look at the level of adoption from +100 Banks and FIs, as well as a 40-50 central bank consortium from around the world. If Bitcoin had a remote chance of becoming the global digital asset standard it needed to have garnered support from those in the global financial community who control monetary policy (i.e. IMF, World Bank, US Fed, ECB, PBoC etc.).  I believe Bitcoin would have been more readily accepted by the broader financial/banking/regulatory community had there been a more conciliatory partnership to help make improvements to the overall system. This chasm created by Bitcoin, coupled with the lack of network This gave rise to others, like Ripple, who saw the opportunity to strategically place themselves as the antithesis of Bitcoin's anti-bank stance and technological disadvantages. Instead of following the footsteps of Bitcoin in opposition to the entire banking/financial system, Ripple embraced the role of helping banks/regulators modernize the antiquated financial systems in place around payments of all types (cross-border, Retail, P2P, B2B, etc.). This show of good-faith, cooperation, and support from Ripple to the broader financial, banking, and regulatory community worldwide has not gone unrewarded. This pretentious idea many in the “cryptosphere” have believing governments and central banks around the world are going to relinquish the reigns of monetary policy, AML, KYC, and CFT laws to the PoW or consensus mechanism performed by a cryptocurrency or digital asset without having rules and regs in place to govern such said processes is simply nonsense.",1523494112

"This is not going to be a popular opinion, but purchasing a freely exchangable crypto CURRENCY is exactly the same as taking a cash advance out of your CC account. Because it can simply be exchanged back for dollars, euros, etc. and that’s the entire point of crypto isn’t it. 

Banks charge more and allow smaller withdrawals of cash for a reason: once the cash is out of the ATM it’s untraceable and they have no recourse against fraudulent actors. 

Complaining about banks treating crypto like a real currency in this case takes some serious chutzpa from a community centered around the very concept that CRYPTOS ARE LEGIT CURRENCIES. Some might call it hypocritical. ",1523493502

"The only way to cut volatility is for more share of market to be controlled by market makers, people who maintain both bid and ask offers and profit on the spread, than by speculators. Only way that happens is for market makers to profit faster than pure hodlers or other timing strategies. That requires random volatility to be large in comparison to price growth or even predictable movements. So we need volatility now to end volatility later. But as soon as volatility does diminish, wealth preservationists and speculators will be attracted into crypto causing a new cycle of boom, bubble, and bust. So I forsee price stability being short lived for foreseeable future, perhaps until after mass adoption and mainstreaming of crypto, or even collapse of fiat.",1523493427

Crypto is a volatile market. There are many, many factors at play that determine the direction of the market, the rise and fall of prices, and what coins rise to the top vs those that sink to the bottom. 

The best anyone will ever be able to give you is an educated guess based on these factors, which ones they chose to pay the most attention to, and any personal biases they might possess. 

The key is to stay skeptical and do your own research. At the end of the day nobody can give you a 100% solid reason as to why this project is better than that one, why you should put your money here rather than there, and what the market is going to look like tomorrow.

"Nah, while Bitcoin has been the ALPHA it won't be the OMEGA in the end. That is reserved for Ripple's XRP. NO OTHER blockchain organization/foundation can lay claim to Ripple's level of adoption in any industry especially the global financial community as a whole……. NONE!!! While most can only speak of ""collaborations"" and ""proofs-of-concept."" Ripple can actually show evidence and provide proof of how they are solving their ""ACTUAL"" customers problems. 


The ultimate measure of success for a blockchain company/foundation and its respective digital asset/blockchain technology is through adoption. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and has been around for many years. However, where is its mass adoption by major retailers, companies, etc.?  When you think about it, the only mainstream adoption Bitcoin has is that of serving as the de-facto base/exchange currency at a majority of crypto exchanges. Bitcoin has, what I like to call, ""sporadic boutique"" retail usage here and there, but nothing noteworthy after +10 years in the game. Let me put it this way. If Bitcoin's network is so magnificent then why don't we hear of its worldwide domination of fiat currency etc.?? That is a simple question. Let me be clear, I'm not bashing Bitcoin. Like I've stated elsewhere the blockchain technology that gave rise to Bitcoin has ushered in a whole new industry around digital securities/assets allowing the transfer of digital property/value, such that the transfer is guaranteed to be safe and secure. It's just a laughable to see so many clinging to this delusional fantasy of how Bitcoin and its new and improved ""Lightning Network"" it is going to solve the scaling and exploding transactional cost problems. The truth is that there is a huge misunderstanding that unlimited scaling (via the new Lightning Network) will solve all Bitcoin's problems. Because every open/close of an LN channel means an expansion in transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, causing the bottleneck shifts from a limit on the transactions that can be processed on-chain to a bottleneck on how many payment channels can be opened or closed at any given time. It's important to remember that Lightning doesn't allow instant settlement of funds. That means that you can't spend lightning funds until the lightning channel has been closed and the final state transmitted to the blockchain. Effectively what lightning does is allow a massive increase in the capacity for changing ownership of BTC but the BTC doesn't ""move"" until the channel closes. This means that if more than 7 channels want to close per second you will once again get lag.",1523491581

Next month if BTC is 8k, I will keep the difference of 20k between what I sold (10x10k) and what I had to buy to repay the loan (10x8k). If I'm wrong and BTC goes up to, say, 12k, then at the time of the settlement I'll owe the difference between the 100k I borrowed/sold and the 120k it will cost to repay the loan of 10 BTC at 12k/ each, resulting in a loss of 20k.",1523491487

Having the ability to spin up a node for almost no cost and within hours is really just a deterrent against an attack. No need to be running a node now... but I know that I can if the government started regulating node services and it became hard for me to find someone like electrum, ledger, trezor, etc that offers wallet services. 

Imagine how much easier it would be for a government to regulate or secretly control the eos network when each miner or node must be a major company which is subject to being shut down and having their expensive equipment taken away.

With traditional market analysis one would look at previous sales trends and compare to recent trends, however more recently with the advent of social media big data tech is used to analyse what people are ""thinking"" about certain products.

At first you have hype driven market, people jump on without thinking hoping to make easy money. But after that bursts the sobering reality hits and consumers/investors no longer jump blind into it.    
So you don't have a value to compare but you can see the current sentiment is very different than before. So what drove the market previously is no longer there.

FOMO played a larger role in it.   
Now, a larger percentage of people are going to look at the fundamentals and they will find that there are no real fundamentals because majority of these coins don't have a real product it is all vapor ware.

The deal was that I would release the first half of my Bitcoins to him after he showed me proof that he was going to wire transfer the full amount of the $6,300 to my bank account. I would then pay him the second half of the money after I had received the payment. I agreed, even though it seemed like a somewhat sketchy deal, because this guy had a 100 percent feedback rating, I trusted him somewhat. This was 8 or 9 days ago, and he had said that the transfer would take 2 days maximum. After it did not send for 4-5 days, he attributed it to Easter weekend. 
On Wednesday April 4th, he had basically told me that I should have received an email from my bank (which I now believe to be fake), I did not see the email originally, but he told me to check my spam, and I saw it in there. He asked me at this point to release the other half of the Bitcoin so he could get confirmation from his bank to send the money over. The email stated that I would receive the payment 1 hour after confirmation from the sender's bank. It has now been 3 days and I am fed up with this.

"&gt; and that's because it teaches people to spend their money as quickly as possible and punishes saving

you don't need to spend (or invest) money ""as quickly as possible"" at 0-3% inflation. At that rate you have months before you would notice any meaningful decrease in purchasing power. If you need to store wealth over periods of years you're much better off storing it in a form that provides a benefit to your life (like a house, or solar panels, or a share of a wealth generating business). you can't live in a pile of cash or heat your home with it (well, not unless you set it on fire).

When people spend money it doesn't waste or destroy any wealth, they just convert wealth held in money into wealth in a usable form. If you spend money to buy solar panels that cuts your electricity bills in half, that is not somehow worse for the economy than if you just leave that cash under a mattress. 

You're talking about saving as if its something other than keeping value you have produced in a token form and then not doing anything with it for long periods of time.

Saving doesn't generate any wealth, investment does. you don't want to encourage saving (hoarding) of currency, you want to encourage investment. A currency system where it rewards you more for doing nothing with cash than to put it to good use is not a good one.


&gt;Money isn't meant to generate value itself, it's a way to keep track of things we own and exchange with each other

It's meant to generate value by facilitating value generating trade. Why would anyone trade anything if trading didn't make you better off? You don't need currency if you're not making any trades.

&gt;I'm currently using bitcoin for saving and fiat for spending because that's the cheapest and easiest way for me

&gt;Other deflationary assets are not as liquid and convenient for me, and also are not nearly as exciting.

If you're using fiat for cash and bitcoin for savings then why do you care if other deflationary assets are not as liquid? Savings you're holding for years at a time don't need to be liquid. And there is far more liquidity in things like gold, and more stability, even if it doesn't generate any wealth just having gold sitting in some account.

Are you sure its the potential for savings that is ""exciting"" and not imaging that you're going to make huge speculative gains on bitcoin?",1523487363

If I use that 6.5k Bitcoin to buy something, say an expensive domain name. Now I go buy BTC at 6.5k, it is the same thing as if I spent 6.5k in cash.

At the end of the day I have my 6.5k domain name and I still have my 6.5k worth of Bitcoin and I spent 6.5k in cash (plus minor fees) just like I would've if I bought with cash instead of BTC.

"&gt;this could be happening &gt;100 times/sec

Do you mean each node is going to update every one of its channels fees &gt;100 times a second, or across *all* channels, there will be &gt;100 fee updates per second? If the former, I think that's ridiculous. If the latter, so what? It's not a problem now, and in the future every node won't need to know about every channel.

&gt;what happens if there is a DDoS attack and nodes are popping on and offline constantly

What does that have to do with anything? Nodes going on or offline doesn't require propagation of information through the network.

&gt;Why would you go from 100% propagation on BTC to anything less than 100%? 

I don't think you understand what we're talking about here. Lightning payments don't propagate, they hop from channel to channel until they reach the destination. If you choose one route and it fails, then your node tries another route, and another, until it finds one that works. We're talking about a matter of seconds here, with no possibility of losing funds for a failed route.

&gt;False, he said a million channels

I suggest you read [this post](https://medium.com/@rusty_lightning/lightning-routing-rough-background-dbac930abbad). He builds models of 10k, 100k, 1m nodes with 4 channels each, updating their fees *every second*. I'd say that's a pretty worst case scenario, wouldn't you?",1523486136

"When you short something, you're basically placing a bet that the price will fall. But to short you're doing it on margin, meaning with borrowed money. Basically shorting is when you borrow shares of a company (or some BTC in our case) and then sell them immediately. The guy who lent you the shares or crypto is gonna want that amount back, so if you were right and the price does fall, when they want their property back you buy them at market price and keep the difference.


Buuuut, the big thing with trading on margin is that you have to have some money as collateral to protect the lender if the price moves the opposite direction than what you expect. So if you sell 10 BTC when the price is 6k and then when it's time to buy it back, if the price has gone to 100k then you somehow have to purchase $1 million worth of BTC when you only made 60k from the sell. And basically you would be fucked and not have enough money to pay back the lender. The crazy thing about this is there's more people shorting bitcoin now than when the price was 20k. If the price goes up buy a lot, there's gonna be a lot of people up shit creek!",1523486044

"If it continues to eat up fiat like it has, then this is simply not something we can avoid. 

If you wanted a stable Bitcoin, you kind of want Bitcoin to stop pumping in money from the outside, which you cannot do. 


Again, so long as you spend and replace, it's not a problem whatsoever. 


&gt; Then it's not suitable as a form of currency.


Thus simply said, I disagree. It's a very unpopular opinion, but I just don't see it as much of an issue. Of course BTC can't be stable, because it continues to pump up in value. 


And this will also never change, but it will exponentially keep pumping in more money. 



And also, I've yet to really find a coin, that's not like this. BCH for example pumps in value, as Bitcoin pumps along - if it doesn't die. Hell maybe it takes over, I don't know. 



Ether pumps too. And most other coins really. That would kind of mean that none of them are not usable as currency.

"&gt;Why do you think BTC core developers are so determined on 3rd layer services to solve their problems? Whereas BCH solves many of these problems without the need for ""toll booth 3rd layer"" services?

This is great and very much to the point - The answer I'd say from everything I've seen is simply that BTC's design philosophy places significant value in a large network of non-mining full nodes that can be feasibly run by individual participants, even at the expense of very cheap base layer tx, whereas BCH does not see value in that, and is OK to make that design tradeoff.

Is that a good design tradeoff? I see good arguments for each side, which is why I still hold some of both coins. But that right there is at the root of every difference i see between the two technologies. BTC could go ahead and raise their block size, and the network would work fundamentally like BCH does (+/- some tx format differences, diff adjustment algo, etc), but doing so (some reasonably argue) would push the network down a path that ends in consolidation of all the protocol validation in the hands of only the fairly wealthy few or even just the hands of the same people tasked with securing the network.

Since Tether can print unlimited USDT and then use those to buy Bitcoin with on Bitfinex. When enough people go short you will see another 20% uptick and people using to much leverage in their margin positions will get liquidated. It's a big gamble house when you play with margin trading in a totally unregulated market and the house always wins because they cheat.

No they wouldn't because the majority of the mining hardware that comprises those pools belongs to affiliates. The pool members are not evenly distributed around the globe - most of the hardware resides in China.

"You seem pretty knowledgeable and informed in the crypto space and yet these comments blindly follow the FUD narrative of this sub. This isn't a shill post, it's a post direct from the developers explaining the economic model in more detail, which in turn informs investors and gives a clearer picture as to what they are investing in. 

There was one instance of brigading a few months ago, which has been dealt with in the community itself as well as serving a ban here. Legitimate partnership posts, I believe, even in coins I don't hold are interesting and informative. If one project is acquiring the amount of quality partnerships as Vechain, I believe that is good content. The very fact that you are in this community means you should support adoption of crypto into real life industries and Vechain are pioneering into multiple industries; supply chain, alcohol, automotive, luxury brands, smart cities to name a few. This is going to generate a lot of news articles.

Why on earth anybody is anti Vechain I do not know. Even if you don't like the community, the actual use cases being highlighted for crypto are astounding and should be celebrated. Once Vechain penetrates these industries it opens the door for other players in the future to easily enter the space and innovate.

So let's take a look, yes there are currently 2 Vechain news stories on the front page, one being exposure in a national paper in England and the other being an informed and detailed update from the developers on the economic model for the upcoming mainnet release. These stories deserve to be there. Both are fantastic for crypto as a whole. Yesterday we had 2 stories as well, one a collaboration with LV in an incubator startup with many other startups, potentially opening up connections and use cases nobody has even considered and one a partnership, which once again is a first for crypto as a whole and another step into integration of blockchain in the automotive industry, both of which were removed. I have no idea why they were removed but still, none of those 4 posts were paid shill posts, fake news, brigaded or bot upvoted.

"As far as I understand the locking up of bitcoin to use in a sidechain is trivial with segwit activated. It's similar to how you lock funds in a lightning channel. But in order to get your money back from the sidechain you either need to somehow trust the miners of the sidechain or you need a way for bitcoin to understand a ""locking up/destruction"" of sidechain funds. When you leave the blockchain you essentially give the unlock keys to the sidechain network and when you want to withdraw funds you have to trust it to give you your funds back and if the sidechain has some bug or if it's winding down you might be left with nothing. There are many papers and discussions about how to incentivize the sidechain miners to do this but none, that I've seen, seems reasonable.

Sidechains could be a great thing but it seems to me that cross chain atomic swaps and lightning network cross currency atomic swaps would be much better.",1523481382

You didn't provide a single reason why it has to be valued like money when everything it does is a service, and not money.

That's your answer? That's like saying diamonds have value because they've had value since the dawn of man. There's no reason for them to have (high) value, but XRP isn't even physical so it must provide function because anyone could make XRP2.

Bitcoin is trust-less and permission-less the people don’t need the govt to use it.

"You trade based on your liquidity and margin of change.

If bitcoin is worth $100 and you want to margin trade with $10, you would have to provide 150% of the margin in your account ($15) for a single margin trade. The exchange would let you borrow 1 asset (an asset being a $100 bitcoin) with an agreement to give it back to the exchange.

You place $15 into a margin account, sell your bitcoin for $100, and wait.

If the price drops to $90, you buy it back (automatically) and give the bitcoin back to the exchange. Now you have $25 in your margin account.

If the price goes to $110, you break your margin and buy it back (automatically) and give it back to the exchange. Now you have $5 in your margin account.

The overhead is for covering spikes.

"I already listed how I think they'll make money, by offering services, either in custom software development like Liquid or in consulting services to others working to design or implement their own technology with bitcoin/blockchain software. Who wouldn't want to hire the people most familiar with the inner workings of BTC to guide/advise on their own blockchain tech? I'm sure they'll also do things like running big LN hubs if they can, but that isn't poised to be a revenue source they can ""capture"" unfairly; if they can't offer competitive rates no one will use them, and they certainly can't force anyone to let them profit from LN that I can see.

That alone looks like enough to justify some few $million of investment, easily. Not to mention the indirect payoff of securing development efforts to actually improve the value of BTC and the return investors get on their own crypto holdings.

&gt; Bitcoin is a Stackleberg competition in game theory.

&gt; So the incentives of the system are always shifting and keeping themselves in balance.

Citation needed.

&gt;  I never said SM is not a vulnerability that should be considered. I said it has not been proven to be viable in a real economic incentive system.

I may just be fucking stupid here, but you're going to have explain the difference to me like I'm five. At least if you intend to continue accusing me of all the things you did.

&gt; If they wanted to word their paper differently and behave more honestly it would have been a lot more scientific.

So is your argument that they were trying to push an agenda on their paper, and thusly the things that they **did** show should simply be discarded? 

I don't know man. In my job I deal with academic research on a daily basis, and it's a frequent occurrence that I don't quite agree with the opinions laid out in the ""discussion"" and ""conclusions"" section of the papers. I don't tend to throw hissy fits about it; I just judge the data for what it shows. 

But regardless; just how their opinions don't change the nature of what they showed, much less does yours. I hope you understand this, because so far I'm having doubts.

Selfish Mining is a potentially economically advantageous strategy for mining under certain conditions. I know this is something you don't want to hear, but if you disagree, you're going to have to do a heck of a lot more than persist on these asinine discussions to do it. Your time would be better invested into crafting your own papers, building your own models, and if you succeed in contradicting theirs, trying to prove why yours should be closer to reality than theirs.

"&gt; Nothing humble about it. I'm lamenting the fact that despite my (publicly available and regularly pointed out) track record of later-proven-correct calls, there seems to be a never-ending supply of fools (like you!) who ignore it and try to mock those who have been trying to point these things out (in advance and with regularity) for years now.

Somewhere there is some fool proclaiming they are a TA stock market genius because they ""were right"".  Suviorship bias is a thing, Yo!

&gt;A few things to note here. Bitcoin is technically disinflationary at this time, if we're talking about supply inflation (which is distinct from deflationary). If you're talking about price deflation,

Congrats on knowing the difference.  I do not consider price inflation to be inflation.  The naming here is really annoying to me, and intellectually dishonest IMO.  Regarding supply inflation, I think you should view Bitcoin NOT as dis-inflationary but rather deflationary, as in the supply is decreasing, not that the rate of increase is slowing.  In other words, the supply of bitcoin IS fixed (less those that are lost), but not all of them are yet claimed.

See [here for a better explaination](http://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-is-not-inflationary/)

then you are arguing that ""any moron should be able to see that Bitcoin will go up in price"" which is not at all true, and a point of massive dispute (and if it were so obvious, we would see effectively-immediate hyperbitcoinization as a result). Most people don't believe that Bitcoin is going to continue rising in price (despite its supply growth curve) and this is absolutely a niche opinion right now. Of course, most people don't have ""a correct understanding of monetary economics"" either, but that brings us to yet another point: such a thing probably does not objectively exist, anyway.

A correct understanding of monetary economics would be a cohesive explanation of what money's function is and what attributes make one currency better than another, as well as an ability to predict what the outcome of currency competition in a market.

As to hyperbitcoinization, this does NOT depend on people realizing Bitcoin is superior and coming to the correctly conclusion; aslo I would argue hyperbitcoinization IS happening right now--it is a process that will take some time.

You on the other hand, seem to be a clown that makes a bunch of price predictions, and because of survivor bias think that price action validates your stated reasons, *even though you are not able to show causality*

You remind me of [this asshole](https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=387775871), who predicted the stock market crash of 1929, but whose understanding of the reasons WHY were....a bit off.

&gt;, I was arguing that we'd very likely see prices north of $10k within 2 years of the 2016 halvening, over a year before the halvening occurred, so let's just get that out of the way now

I predict it is very likely we will see prices north of $100k within the next 4 years BECAUSE OF THE TRANSIT OF MERCURY.  When this happens, I will come back to /r/bitcoin and make absurd proclamations bragging about how right I am. 

 &gt;Not only is that a ridiculous conclusion in the first place and basically just childish hyperbole, but you have no idea what my financial situation is like and I have no intention of being baited by an obvious troll into disclosing it anyway.
Like I said, these predictions are publicly verifiable for anyone who cares to check (or even ask), but instead of curiosity or recognition I am more often met with crude and ignorant attempts at derision, of which you're an excellent example.

&gt; Everybody is also free to follow any initiative taken by any other person.

&gt; Everybody is free to take no action at all.

&gt; However, nobody may tell anybody else what to do, what initiative to take, not 
take, follow, or not follow.

I sincerely don't care what your position on Craig is. Creating lists of people is absolutely toxic, in my eyes. I wouldn't tolerate a list of Roger supporters, and I don't tolerate having a list of Craig supporters.

&gt; OUR SEVEN SOCIAL PRINCIPLES:

&gt; WE ASSUME GOOD FAITH.

&gt; WE REWARD THE POSITIVE.

&gt; WE ACT WITH DIGNITY.

&gt; WE TRUST EACH OTHER TO FAIL WELL.

&gt; WE DO NOT ASK PERMISSION.

&gt; THE NETWORK IS MOTHER, THE NETWORK IS FATHER.

&gt; WE HAVE FUN, BECAUSE IT ATTRACTS MORE PEOPLE.

Don't let the trolls cloud our goals.

"I think it is the short time frame, if you were to repeat this but weekly delta the correlation would be almost perfect.

This shows its a weak methodology, they should be looking at correlation of normalized value not 'percentage change'.

After all, if I take two coins both worth 10 yesterday one goes to 6 today and 7 tomorrow, the other goes to 8 today and 7 tomorrow, that has poor correlation, despite being the same total change over 2 days.

In other words the generally high volatility in crypto makes analyzing daily-delta very misleading. 

A better methodology would correlate the actual close prices. It would be interesting to see which coins correlate better with each other than their own autocorrelation at given lags. (For example BCH may correlate better with BTC than BCH(-1).

 If someone has that data I am happy to run that analysis looking at cross-correlation and auto-correlation at given lags.",1523478525

"I don't know what you want. I'll try to address your points in a few times. If banks only borrowed what they owned there would be no bank runs, even today if a decently sized group goes to a bank and tries to withdraw their money all at once there would be a problem, the bank would end up not allowing people to withdraw their money. Therefore, your money is not really your money and you're not in control of it. Not only that, this has horrible effects and can lead to a depression. If that isn't a problem for you then I don't know what to tell you.

The tax thing I proposed was just an idea, not much thought in it but a potential solution, just like they do it for electric cars in certain states and other countries.

&gt; Second, by creating a bracketed system where people that spend more get a higher tax rate,

I never said this, I left my idea simple and not much thought to be open to interpretation, obviously the system would not go to 0% it would offer a nice discount or something similar. Just like you can deduct home property taxes but you can not deduct your entire home property tax you paid for or else rich people could benefit too much, right? Similar story.

By in the end, I mean, if this all goes to shit you still have a piece of software that has the potential to be used as a store of money that is trustless. This did not exist until 2009. 

&gt; People living in poverty doesn’t matter?

In the case of Bitcoin, no, because as of right now, Bitcoin is nowhere near finished and is nowhere near being used to save people from property. Bitcoin has only been around for 9 years and it hasn't solved poverty or is the backbone of modern standards of living so it could go to $0 and 95% of everybody in the world would be fine. What are you even trying to say?

&gt; What makes it more controllable than any other currency?

Really? Do you not understand the implications that software has? The same way internet has increased information availability to the common people, software can do the same with money. I can draw up some scenarios. Cash/physical dollars work pretty well, but where do you store it? In a waterproof, fireproof safe in your home? More money, gotta buy a bigger safe. What happens if someone steals the safe? Your money is gone. 

With Bitcoin, you can store everything in a flash drive, cd, piece of paper, whatever you name it, and you can store it on each medium in an encrypted manner AND you can make replicas! You can have a copy in your home, car, work, family's house. Nobody can access it unless they have your password as it is encrypted if someone were to take it, and if you're house were to catch on fire you can go get a copy that you put somewhere else. The only other solution to this in the cash world is vault owned and controlled by the banks, that can ""disappear"" or be seized. Another thing, seizures can not happen with Bitcoin. They can steal the medium you stored your keys but they will never get your actual coins because you encrypted it.

I have written enough for you, don't even get me started on e-commerce. You need a credit or debit card, cash does not work online and our solution is to rely on intermediaries which is absolutely horrible. This means you need to turn over your name, address, income, and social security to a bank or credit card company (some type of financial institution). That information gets sent and sold to third parties and you have to hope that your financial insitution or their third parties they send the info to gets hacked (Equifax...bet you don't agree with that do you?). These institutions are nasty, charging fees if you withdraw more money than you have (why not just not allow withdrawing them), and charging tons of money when trying to send money to someone overseas.

I don't know if your head is in the clouds or what. Learn about open source software in computing and how much freedom it gives  the common folk, apply that to Bitcoin and you will understand why it is amazing.

I doubt 90% of patents even work, and doubt 95% is even enforceable (wouldn't hold in litigation). All you have to do to get a patent is write the document and pay the fee.

"Yes, that's my whole point.

The [Great Chinese Feedback Loop](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1otsjw/the_great_chinese_feedback_loop/) post, made when bitcoins were around $160 each, shows my reasoning on the latter 2013 bubble (and predicting what I considered to be the only plausible catalyst for why it would eventually pop), which was later validated with the ""China bans Bitcoin"" nonsense. Earlier comments than that post (in BitcoinMarkets) were discussing the realistic possibility of $1000+ prices on the forthcoming bull-run.

For the ""calling the effect of the halvening in advance"" corroboration, I once compiled together a really nice list of links to comments that I had made about it, but can't find it right now. Oh well, a quick search turned [this comment from 2015](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/3o6mdy/daily_discussion_saturday_october_10_2015/cvul5l7/), [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/4fwu6l/fundamentals_friday_week_of_friday_april_22_2016/d2ee1vm/) and [this one (both from 2016) reiterating the logic](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/5iyhfz/daily_discussion_sunday_december_18_2016/dbcwd56/), and then [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5l9j8t/what_was_your_bitcoin_moment_of_the_year_2016/dbu69zb/) to hammer the same point home.

Finally, a little over 4 months ago (when the price was around $11k and everyone was in the ""this bull market will never end!"" mania phase) a couple of redditors asked me ""Can you share some of your future predictions"", to which [I responded](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hplk4/remember_if_you_only_knew_last_weeks_lottery/dqtpiv5/):

&gt;The one prediction I *do* have to share is something no one wants to hear right now: this incredible exponential price growth we've been seeing in Bitcoin *will* end, and the market will correct downwards *violently*. And I don't mean a 20-30% drop, I mean a 60-90% drop, where true despair sets in and everyone who hasn't been through a Bitcoin bear market before (and even some who have) feel the *other* side of holding Bitcoin. Many will sell every satoshi they own, and say ""I knew it was a scam all along"" and kick themselves for ever getting involved... it's coming. I don't know if **the drop will come after a top at $12k, or at $20k, or even at $30k, but I am confident beyond confident that it will come sometime in the next few months.** It won't be the end of Bitcoin's amazing growth (though it might feel like it), so those who truly take the long-term outlook will benefit from it...

A cabal of those economic members colluded together, threatening to force the Bitcoin users and miners to accept Bitcoin protocol changes without consensus with BIP148 or be without services. It became obvious that Bitcoin's decentralized protocol security is completely broken, while the Bitcoin economy still relies so heavily on these private and easily influenced, ticked, or blackmailed service providers, without prominent decentralized alternatives.

Don't forget that today BCH also [wants to become a smart contracts platform](https://coingeek.com/smart-contracts-way-bitcoin-cash/) and invite various CryptoKitties, most likely with a short term goal to increase the number of transactions which is currently pathetic.

refers only to the bitcoin network and it's not related to BitDNS.

dont worry, readers will decide for themselves who is right and who is wrong and if satoshi's ""small devices"" means ""server farms"" or ""low end pc/phones""

i have none at hand. this is what happened and frankly i dont care if you believe it or not

satoshi made it as permanent as it is now. otherwise the limit would be in the software and not in the consensus code.

"&gt; spending increases the market size thus increases the price

Speculation at specialized locations is a better outreach mechanism than spending.  People can already find others to exchange with, so market size is currently limited by speculative belief, not merchant activity.  

This leaves store of value as the strongest basis for money.  Bitcoin has a lot more adoption and speculative smoothing technology (derivative trading) to integrate before it is a nice and boring store of value.

In order to not get stuck in a referential loop based purely on scarcity (like gemstones), it's very helpful to any wannabe money when everyday merchant activity is possible.  This requires commodity-level fungibility that allows quick verification.  It's great if something like the lightning network gives Bitcoin a better medium of exchange story than dollar bills, Paypal, and credit cards.  But this can develop over time.  

It is not necessary to take any unnatural exchange loss to use bitcoins in places where you could otherwise spend fiat that is burning a hole in your pocket.  Let the technology get better and more widespread, and let more people get sick of how bad fiat money is.

"&gt; except bch tries to maximize it's use of the word bitcoin and minimize it for btc and in many unscrupulous ways. 

As I said in my other response, I haven’t seen this happening. Perhaps due to my own bias. I can only speak for myself when I say I only shorten Bitcoin Core to Core for brevity and I do the same thing for Cash.

&gt; when you think about it, why didn't it just start a new coin like LTC using the same software? 

The answer to this is simple but requires a knowledge of Bitcoin history, which you clearly don’t posess. Bitcoin is a community. A subset of the Bitcoin community determined that the Bitcoin Core developers had “gone rogue” or at the very least were not acting in the best interests of the community as a whole. If you know the history of Bitcoin, you know that it has always been commonly accepted in the Bitcoin community that in the event of rogue developers or miners, the response would be a hard fork.

The Bitcoin Cash community still considers itself part of the Bitcoin community. We’re not Litecoiners. We’re not Ethers. We’re not alt-coiners. We’re Bitcoiners. We always have been, and we still are.

Bitcoin Cash is not “something new” here to capitalize on the Bitcoin brand. Bitcoin Cash IS Bitcoin. It’s developed by Bitcoiners, for Bitcoiners, and for the entire world.

Incidentally, the idea that forking away from rogue developers or miners is one of the reasons I support the idea of Bitcoin Core changing the PoW. If the Bitcoin Core community honestly believe the miners have gone rogue, they absolutely should fork. I think they’re wrong. I don’t think the miners have gone rogue. But I won’t try to dissuade Core from forking. Of course, if they do fork, the beneficiary of that fork will be Bitcoin Cash. All those billions of dollars invested in mining infrastructure aren’t just going to give up and go away.

Won’t happen though. Bitcoin Core’s only claim to being the “one true Bitcoin” is that the fork they did was a “soft” fork maintaining backwards compatibility (a lie, but commonly accepted within the Core community) and that they have the majority of hash-power. They’re not going to give that up.

"""Kids everywhere are choosing high morals over food, shelter, or a valued wage, working for peanuts, mere peanuts, because Bitcoin!""

Blockchain people are stupidly hypocritical and moronic, when it comes to their ""high morality"" of ""I'm in it for the technology"" shit - Sure, we all are, but I could also invest in Tesla, or just throw money at a tech charity, if that's all I cared about.

"&gt; Bitcoin core is not a fork. It has always maintained it's own path. It didn't change direction or codebase. BCH forked and split into a different direction. It is an offshoot of btc.

The only thing true about this statement is that BCH is a fork of BTC. Nobody denies that.

However, BTC today is also a fork of the original BTC, in more ways than one. For starters, the original Bitcoin codebase was maintained by a completely different team. The current developers forced out the original team, changed the name of the project (from Bitcoin to Bitcoin Core), and dramatically altered the roadmap. The original roadmap was all about the blockchain, including scaling. The Bitcoin Core developers are the ones who decided to de-prioritize the blockchain itself and decided development should focus on “layer two” technologies. None of this was part of the original Bitcoin.

That’s just the strategic changes that have been made. But on August 24th, the protocol itself was forked when Segwit activated. From that date forward, all full nodes (and by full I mean including mining not just validating) are required by a change in the consensus rules to upgrade and validate Segwit differently than before. Failure to upgrade and acknowledge Segwit will result in getting kicked off the network by other miners and validating nodes. That’s the textbook definition of a fork. You can call it soft or hard, but a fork by any other name is still a fork.
 
&gt; Obviously btc is synonymous with the coin

I said Bitcoin Core is synonymous with the coin. It’s also synonymous with the ticker (BTC).
 
&gt; This is why no real company can claim the name ""coke different"" or ""coke blue"" or whatever. 

There are many “coke forks”. Coke, Coke Classic, Coke Zero, Diet Coke, Caffeine-Free Coke, Caffein-Free Diet Coke, Cherry Coke, Vanilla Coke, Lemon Coke, some version of Coke that uses cane sugar that comes in a green can. There is no legal concern here because the Coca-Cola company owns all the Coke brand and all the fork brands too.

The Bitcoin brand has no owner, except maybe Satoshi Nakamoto, and he has yet to weigh in on the branding debate. You might also make the argument that the brand belongs to the Bitcoin community. In that case, remember that the Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Core communities are each subsets of the larger Bitcoin community. The thought leaders of each community were all thought leaders of the community long before the split. Those of us on the Bitcoin Cash side ALL consider ourselves Bitcoin supporters, regardless of our opinions of Bitcoin Core. And we do not appreciate attempts from the Bitcoin Core community to take that away from us.
 
&gt; BCH tries to minimize using the word bitcoin when referring to btc and maximize the word when referencing bch. 

If that’s the case, I haven’t noticed it. Speaking only for myself, I only refer to Bitcoin Core as Core for the sake of brevity. I do the same for Bitcoin Cash. I never refer to either coin as bcore or bcash, and I’ve only ever seen the Cash supporters do that in retaliation against a troll screaming “bcash btrash” at the top of his lungs.
 
&gt; To be clear, I don't mind both sharing the name but it should be seperate and clear to the market. 

If you sincerely want to be clear, you should refer to BTC as Bitcoin Core. “Bitcoin” should be used only when referring to the community at large or the Bitcoin family of coins. Bitcoin Cash supporters will often state that “Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin”. We never state that “Bitcoin is only Bitcoin Cash”, and we always clarify which Bitcoin we’re talking about when there’s any room for doubt. I have NEVER seen someone use only the name “Bitcoin” when referrring specifically to Bitcoin Cash. Only Bitcoin Core supporters are so arrogant.
 
&gt; be clear that it is now and forever more a different, distinct and separate product.

We are very clear on that. We don’t want to be confused with Bitcoin Core as we consider it an inferior product.
 
&gt; ""You're advocating censorship?"" 

You indicated you were in favor of silencing the “Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin” narrative. Given that this narrative is a widely held opinion within the Bitcoin Cash community, and even extends outside of the community, then you are in favor of silencing a significant group. That’s textbook censorship.
 
&gt; I'm advocating truth and honesty not ""fake news."" 

So be honest. Bitcoin Core has a new team of developers. Bitcoin Core has diverged from the original Bitcoin roadmap. Bitcoin Core has gone through an irreversible fork. Bitcoin Core is a distinct coin. Just because Bitcoin Core has the majority of miners and users does not make it the original Bitcoin.

There’s another way to look at this. “History is written by the victors”. We are still very much entrenched in a conflict that doesn’t yet have a clear winner. The Bitcoin Core camp have their narrative. The Bitcoin Cash camp has theirs. Until one side concedes to the other (or is wiped out), each side has its own version of the truth.
 
&gt; There is a difference. There is a reason websites get taken away when they don't belong to the real world business. 

This doesn’t actually happen arbitrarily. If you want proof of this, look no further than nissan.com. What does happen is companies get into civil disputes, go to court, and let the legal system sort it out. When a “rightful owner” is established, that entity gets the domain. And usually there will be some court ordered payment of fair market value.
 
&gt; Being first to take the website name or twitter or any social media doesn't mean it was first to use the name in the real world.

Bitcoin Core were not the first to use the Bitcoin brand. The @bitcoin twitter handle was registered in 2011, long before the current Bitcoin Core developers took over the project and renamed it. If Twitter is going to seize the handle, who do they give it to? Who is the rightful owner of the Bitcoin brand? Who gets to decide?
 
&gt; It's deceptive to take the name and pretend to be the real bitcoin currency and disparage it for the benefit of an alt coin. 

You keep coming back to this complete falsehood that someone “took the name”. The same person who has always controlled the @bitoin twitter account is still in control. He just disagrees with the Bitcoin Core narrative. It’s as simple as that.
 
&gt; I --am-- advocating seizure so the rightful owners of the twitter handle get the name that should belong and does belong to them. 

Ok. What individual is the rightful owner of the Bitcoin brand? You can’t exactly turn a twitter handle over to a community. Do you turn it over to known fraud and censor Theymos? His right-hand man Bashco? Greg Maxwell? Luke Dashjr? Blockstream? Satoshi Nakamoto is the only individual who has a valid claim on the brand, and the only individual who has a valid claim on the handle. Conceivably you could turn it over to the ONE PERSON Satoshi named as his successor. That would be Gavin Andreson. And guess what. He supports Bitcoin Cash.
Who knows, maybe it’s Gavin Andreson that already owns the handle. According to Roger Ver (and I’m not stating this as fact, only hearsay), the person who owns the @bitcoin Twitter handle has been an active participant in the Bitcoin community since 2009, went away for awhile, and is once again active and (quite obviously) a Bitcoin Cash supporter. That sounds an awful lot like Gavin Andreson.
 
&gt; According to your words, since it wasn't purchased, the person the handle was seized from deserves no money as compensation for him having the handle and then it getting seized.

Would you mind quoting those words? Doesn’t sound at all like something I would have said.
 
&gt;It's analogous to you going in public and saying your a cop to intimidate people.

No. It’s analogous to actually being a cop and telling you you’re breaking the law when you jaywalk. He’s a Bitcoin supporter. He’s just not a Bitcoin Core supporter. He’s calling out the Bitcoin Core community for being full of crap. He’s calling out the Bitcoin Core community for having diverged from the original roadmap and then falsely claiming they are the “one true Bitcoin”.

"&gt; Chill out, it's going to run again eventually.

As an investment vehicle, sure. As an actual currency, that seems unlikely. You want a currency to be stable - and that means it can't be jumping up in value as much as it can't be jumping down. Bitcoin simply lacks that stability, and as such, will never be widely adopted as a currency.

"&gt;Why didn't bitcoin teach them not to spend money on frivolous things?

But it did! They used their bitcoin to buy a lambo and now have no money left. Pretty darn good lesson from bitcoin there if you ask me, if they haven't learned from that by now then nothing will ever teach them.

&gt;99.99% of wealth creation is done using the legacy fiat money system, and bitcoin is mainly used by speculators trying to make money off each other without generating anything of value.

And only 0.1% are actually good at it using the legacy fiat money system, and that's because it teaches people to spend their money as quickly as possible and punishes saving. Bitcoin is a brand new asset class that is going to be the money of the future, a kind of money that is actually a decent store of value and that encourages saving instead of punishing it. Money isn't meant to generate value itself, it's a way to keep track of things we own and exchange with each other. And Bitcoin does this in a way that's revolutionary and that makes it very valuable.

&gt;If you're just using bitcoin for saving and not using it as a currency, how is it different from just saving your money in other deflationary assets?

I'm currently using bitcoin for saving and fiat for spending because that's the cheapest and easiest way for me.

Other deflationary assets are not as liquid and convenient for me, and also are not nearly as exciting.",1523476116

"&gt; Except all the major Bitcoin Cash node implementations document the currency created on the network as ""Bitcoin Cash""...even if this unit denomination is not part of the network consensus rules, it's something people who actually run nodes surely agreed on by running the software

That applies not to those who run nodes, but those who have Bitcoin Private keys that secure Bitcoin BCH, every one who sold it validated the networks legitimacy by making a value judgment. thse who dont care about the BCH are the ones you talk about.  

&gt;If Bitcoin Cash has merits, it should be able to be seen as valuable on markets without having to pretend to be something else than what it is 

It does, Bitcoin BCH is much Bitcoin and Bitcoin BTC they share the same genesis. 

&gt;While I think about it, I've not really paid attention to all the other forks' communities closely, but from my experience this fork is the only one which seem to claim to be ""Bitcoin"" and not ""Bitcoin X"" do you have any idea why this idea is so important in this community?

I can't speak to the delusions and fundamental behaviors of others. But Bitcoin BCH (aka Cash) is as much Bitcoin as Bitcoin BTC (aka Core or Segwit) Bitcoin has split, there is no ""just"" Bitcoin any more you need a qualifier when talking about bitcoin like Bitcoin BTC, etc Bitcoin is more like a Bitcoin Index than a single coin. 

The reason BCH fans do it is probably a reaction to the BTC fans who also do it. the reality is they are both Bitcoin and conflating either one with Bitcoin is a mistake. ",1523476002

Isidore Heath Hitler (born 1973), formerly Isidore Heath Campbell, is a white supremacist who attracted national media attention in December 2008 after the Greenwich Township, Warren County New Jersey ShopRite refused to make a cake celebrating his son Adolf Hitler Campbell's third birthday. A Nazareth Pennsylvania Wal-Mart later baked and inscribed the cake. Campbell was featured in a documentary, Meet the Hitlers. He is also founder and leader of the pro-Nazi group Hitler's Order.

"#Spoken Word Wednesday

Dear Stranger,

Just 'cause your life is trife and your crypto is fallin’...

Just because
Dinners, 

Were full of glasses 

Smashing
Into paintings,

Like they were planes into buildings,

Just because your attitude shattered chandeliers

Into blizzards of glass tears

And you live with that forlorn fear

That another crypto trader may,

Just may,

Have an edge on you,

Doesn’t mean you’re gonna make me the dark hole you stuff your misplaced private keys in…

I know you’re sick,

I know your disease prevents you from
Seeing the two sides of a story that aren’t yours,

I also know the wars

In your mind

Are designed

By divine reason,

So stop blaming the crypto world

For what you see as Satoshi’s treason,

‘cuz you can’t have summer

In all four seasons…

Satoshi.

The only time I,

Ever came before U,

Were those nights when I’d read from coinmarketcap,

To block out

The boisterous battles of whales

From behind barricaded doors breachless

Like your mental sell walls,

Like your emotions,

Thicker than quicksand

But shallower than the kiddie pool

You never took me to…

I just needed someone to replace the buy wall

I threw fiat currency to,

The buy wall that could only

Hear and echo everything I said,

But could never give me advice,

On how to buy that crypto I liked,

How to write a blockchain,

Or fight,

With lips

Not fists,

So when I watched our neighbor,

Lightin’ up his spliffs,

Who was I supposed to look up to, Satoshi?

Someone who actually noticed I exist,

Or you - 

A plane flying over the ocean with a gas leak,

A short fused brick of C4 

Backfired against the ones your supposed to love more

Than those jackass divorcees you play cards with on weekends…

You were supposed to be the glue,

That bound our family by truth,

But you wore your anger

Like a played out plaid suit,

Way too loose,

Took your marriage and family

And tied us up in a serpentine noose,

And hung us out to dry,

Stranded,

And I can’t understand it,

I was supposed to follow you to the moon

And you left me branded

With absence

Like the church did to our people in the holocaust…

Not that you ever taught me that…

What is it about me that scares you?

Is it ‘cuz I’m a spitting image of you Satoshi?

Eyes, hair, skin,

I look just like you

And you fear the world 

Ever seeing another you,

Another machine of the devil’s creation,

Blatant impatience,

Complacent with hatred,

The invading rapist

Shaking my matrix

Until my purity breaks up 

Like the Giants defense

In football games that we never watched…

You know

Most kids,

Hearts are broken when their Sats leaves,

They’re emotionally bruised,

Lost and confused

About the size of the lambo shoes

They’re left to fill,

But not me,

There was no confusion,

Of all the deep emotions

I could’ve felt,

The only one that stuck and struck me,

Was relief,

A release

From the tyranny

That bled from your insecurity,

It was solace replacing fear,

As a ghost replaced a demon…

Well have no fear,

‘Cuz I will never be you,

I loathe every characteristic of your personality,

I despise every cell body you embody,

And it hurt,

When I needed to call your name for help,

But all that came out,

 was “Charlie”.

I will never be you…

Sincerely,

Ahh, forget it…

No one…

It's ironic because up until about mid last year, I was a Bitcoin maximalist and used BTC exclusively for years, and before 2017, I didn't even touch other coins, not even for speculation, because I didn't see any reason altcoins would have meaningful value or adoption compared to BTC. Network effect and the fact that other coins didn't really have any meaningful improvements for payments.

Once the mempool got closer and closer to filling, I started dabbling a bit in other coins, and when BCH forked, I naturally gravitated towards it because it is what I saw Bitcoin to be when I first learned about it (2011).",1523475261

"Just going off GDAX order book. If you were to market sell 1000 bitcoin right now, it would plunge the price by $160... whereas if you market sold 10 bitcoin, it would drop the price by $6. Ergo, the smaller position would have a much higher average selling price than the larger position. Now lets say you are trying to scalp a $100 move. You probably walk away with about $994 if you were trading 10 bitcoin. Whereas if you were trading 1000 bitcoin the same trade would be a $60,000 loss.

And day traders dont just make money on the upside, they also make money on the downside by shorting. Its arguably much easier to make money during a bear market as panic selling is alot quicker and more decisive.

And day traders typically manage a single position at a time. So if a hedge fund wanted to day trade 100 different securities to solve the scaling problem, they would have to hire 100 different day traders. And why would the day traders work for them in the first place? You would have to pay them less than they are currently making in order to turn a profit.

Im mainly an investor, but I use knowledge of trading to better manage my positions. The difference is I undertstand markets and trading, whereas you obviously dont.

Overall, its safe to say bulls have been struggling to find their feet as indicated by stagnant prices and a narrowing price range.

Yet, speculation is doing the rounds that big Wall Street names (such as Soros and Rockefeller) are set to enter the crypto space. If confirmed, the news could ramp up the bull case, as happened with the advent of bitcoin futures soon before bitcoin's December price peak.

"I've actually modelled dynamic DA in BCH, as I think the quicker DA makes BCH more susceptible to a theoretical attack (I think a lot can happen in the two weeks SM would be mining at a loss on BTC chain!) and I've done it rather bluntly by using orphans / total to give me a coefficient that I then use to shorten (or length) the block intervals. It seems to work as the total time for 144 blocks seems to tend towards 1440 mins as it should.

&gt; You are missing the advanced tie resolve strategy of selfish miner: If selfish miner found a block and is now one block ahead and there is already an honest block pending, then selfish miner also publishes its blocks.

As regards this I am taking the view that gamma is zero, I think the financial incentive for miners to be directly connected to other miners is high, such that there is no way for the SM to get others to work on their block in a tie situation. In a tie situation I have SM continuing to extend their own private chain, whilst HM continue to build on the public chain - if SM finds a second they publish, orphaning the HM. 

Having written that explanation though its made me question the way this is modelled - I have the SM continuing to mine their own block ""in private"" in a situation where they break the tie, when in fact I think they would have to publish immediately once they orphan. Think I need to go back and have another look...

&gt; There is also a small bias since you adjust difficulty only after HM finds a block but don't adjust the time the SM finds the next block. This is negligible since the difficulty doesn't change much after the first few iterations.
Thats a really good catch! As you say it would be negligible - especially with rolling difficulty adjustment, but I will see if I can fix that.",1523474058

"&gt; If the SM chooses to mine honestly, then by definition no one on the network is selfish mining. You're trying to refute selfish mining by saying that when it's not happening, it doesn't work.

No, the argument of Selfish Mining is that it is more profitable for the SM to follow the Selfish Strategy than it is for the SM to follow the Honest Strategy.  The argument is that the incentive model in Bitcoin does not work.  Yet I prove, that at any point in time, it is more profitable for the SM to mine honestly.  Again, you are misunderstanding the question.  

Please watch my video.  I state near the end that it is true that the Selfish Mining scenario is still an attack even though the SM makes less profit than if they followed the Honest Protocol.  But the fact remains, that the claim of Sirer-Eyal is that a miner following the Selfish Strategy makes more money than if they follow the Honest Strategy and this is not true.  All the Selfish Mining Attack does is cause the Honest Miners to lose money faster than the SM does.  ",1523473622

In simple terms, in zerocoin, you destroy the specific amount of coins (e.g. one bitcoin) and generate a proof that you have actually destroyed that amount. After some time passed, you create a transaction that mints exactly this amount by proving you have burned that amount sometime before, without revealing a particular coin that was destroyed (hence, zero-knowledge proof).

At first, all I made was a joke. People have been hyping AMB since I bought in november, and it's close to the price I bought at. 

My only main point is that as investors in *this* space, there is much less incentive to hold AMB over VEN/WTC at this very point. If I was a venture cap. i'd be investing in AMB.

VET, the highest mcap of these tokens (rightfully so atm), has secured the most demand for their token *at this point in time*, AMB, the least (save WabI, who has lagged behind this year imo).

The problem is being liquidated - if price goes in the opposite direction, the exchange forces you to close your position (so the exchange doesn't lose any money)

Let's say that BTC is at 7k and you open up a 10x short with $100. You are betting on the price to go down. But if Bitcoin goes up $10, you can get liquidated. How? You're doing 10x margin so every $10 move is like $100, which is the total amount that you put in the game yourself. Meaning, the exchange would liquidate you to save their own ass.

"&gt;Guess what was fixed on Nov 13th fork in BCH.

Some, but not all, malleability issues. *My god you guys know so little about cryptocurrencies.* I love that you guys are already open to the idea of trying to copy lightning years later like that’ll finally be when this sub gets respect from the crypto community at large.

Why do you think BCH trades for less than 1/10th of BTC despite sharing the same history? Two different scaling solutions, two different price outcomes. Why? 

Mental gymnatics in 3... 2... ",1523471986
"Pt 2. since my reply was too long.

&gt; he way out? There are two. One, introduce a constant block reward. Aka inflation. I'm personally not really against that, especially because the inflation rate is decreasing in time if the block reward is contstant, say 1BTC/block. But many don't share my view and the most likely outcome is that it won't be introduced. So you reach a no-block reward state. What then? The only way to incentivize miners to keep building on the previous block is if there is a healthy txs fee backlog. OK, so Miner A got X in fees? I'll work on the next block and I know I can get ~X myself, thus extending the blockchain.

Inflation could work but it's not necessary. My argument is that when bitcoin (BCH) is a world wide sound *money* (both a medium of TX and store of value, no reserve currencies) demand for sending bitcoin will be infinite. That demand is kept in check by the cost to run a mining operation.

&gt; 2018 is the year of LN adoption. There are already ~1600 nodes on main net. Those LApps were just released, and people are starting to work on them. By end of 2019 LN will be very wide spread.

I have to disagree and I think you are extremely optimistic on the rate of adoption. Crypto adoption is slow and introducing another 'hop' of LN will slow BTC adoption even more. Of course I could be wrong and mania speculation could make BTC the reserve and LN as payments. I'm trying to see it but I don't. Crypto adoption (and speculation) happens in waves and it won't be like 'oh LN is available everyone adopt!' 

&gt; It's not about mining nodes only, but about full validating, non-mining nodes. Otherwise you can never be ""your own bank"". And if, one day, people could run a fully validating node on their phones, with tech increase and keeping the blockchain small, that would be the ultimate decentralization.

Non mining nodes provide no benefit to the network. You are your own bank by holding your private keys. If for whatever reason bitcoin is co-opted and the network sees it as damage, a chain fork will happen and render the attack useless. This is how I see BCH. BTC has been 'damaged' by its inability to increase the block size so the BCH fork emerged to route around the 'damage'. I will keep working towards 'money for everyone' until it is proven it can't work.

Disagreements aside, thank you for your earnest discussion since all I seem to see now are trolls.",1523471956
"I have most of my investment around 14k. Sad seeing most of what I had liquidated but oh well. I could have said the same thing last year at this time. 

No reason for btc not to drop further. With that being said there is no way this is a extended year long bear market. If it was no country or state would be as interested in passing laws as they are now. 

Lots of tech innovation and schools starting to offer blockchain programs. Imo 4 years and the entire cap is in the several trillions. 

Many projects tackle various business sectors or verticals. Many of these have caps in the billions and trillions. 

McAfee was right about one thing. No mining business will spend millions building a new facility if they can't evaluate ROI 5 or 10 years down the line. 

Just some points I think about when I stare at lambo and moon pictures. ",1523471935
"&gt; I think this is at the core of the entire controversy - This presumed urgency. Well, I claim there is no urgency. The urgency has been entirely fabricated. You don't believe me? How many times did you hear the old lady get out of her corner convenience store ranting about how she couldn't get her groceries with Bitcoin? Old lady not fitting? OK, how about college kids? How often do you hear anything like that? My bet is that you've never heard it. Or if you did, you remeber exactly how many times AND the circumstances, because it's such a rare occurrence.

It does seem like that's what it's coming down to. There is no way to tell how the an alternate timeline will have played out. I'll just say that I got into bitcoin for P2P e-cash. The urgency I see is bitcoin being overtaken by something else. I guess bitcoin dominance on the downtrend doesn't bother you but it bothers me. 

&gt; Reality is that the economy is happily chugging along with fiat. And would continue to do so even without cryptos.

Yes, because you live in the first world. But I hate seeing so much money going to the military to the point of going into debt. I live in the US.

&gt; As for ""Moar babies are dying"" cries, I reject this with the strongest possible force. No, I don't think crypto should only be for the rich nations, and I do see how this amazing tech will help impoverished countries leapfrog setting up a banking sector like you have in the US, much to their own benefit. But I reject that WE must solve THEIR problems. It is not OUR RESPONSIBILITY to fix Venezuela's problems. Or Zimambwe's. Or any other nation on Earth. Countries fuck up on their own, and it was always on them to sort themselves out. As is right. Sure, crypto will help in this, but it on their own people to throw a fucking revolution, if they are unhappy with their situation. Fuck, America did it! France did it! Russia did it! (At some point in their history.)

I don't know where you're from, but in a lot of cases, it *is* my country's (US) fault that certain regions are fucked up. I see crypto as a way to take the power to print money and subsidize the wars away from the powerful.

&gt; Moore's law only continues to hold because of various software optimizations, including parallel computations. The key problem is the rate of growth of the blockchain. The sheer size of the blockchain. Which needs to be a) downloaded, and b) validated. Even if validation was instantaneous, you still need to download it. And if the blockchain grows faster than broadband improves, you have a problem. You have not addressed this point. And, of course, even Moore's law is not unlimited, and the software improvements are already included in the current version of the law. Else it'd be already dead.

I get 100Mbps and 1TB download will take less than 24 hours. If it does become a problem, you don't think people will do anything about it? If it came to that point where validation (with all possible efficiency improvements) takes longer than the rate blocks are created, I will want a block size limit. I will use the chain that benefits me and the network. It is not a problem right now so I'm saying to continue the formula that has been successful for bitcoin before a fee market emerged. To me, forcing a block limit now is going in a direction that hasn't been tested before.

&gt; Blockchain growth/bloat is a problem, a real problem. Have a look at this. Last year, on modern consumer grade hardware and broadband, it was not possible to sync ETH's archivial nodes from scratch. This is not apples-for-apples, I know, but think about it for a bit... You cannot sync ETH's full blockchain TODAY. Thankfully they rely on state-nodes to run the show, which are much smaller, or ETH would be dead in the water. Bitcoin doesn't have this luxury. The takeaway is that blockchain bloat is a real problem.

I only keep up with bitcoin (both) so the article is really interesting. The thing is, I don't see a need to keep past block history. If it is cryptographically proven that the current state is valid, then it's the same as having block history in practice.
If bitcoin's chain gets unmanageably large, a HF could be done where a block N-100000 is effectively the new genesis block of the HF chain.

&gt; How do I guarantee that there won't be 1 million independent miners running huge server farms? Do I really need to answer that?

The point I'm trying to make is, what is a good enough level of decentralization? I never get a clear answer from small blockers.

&gt; On-chain txs fees will be high, absolutely. But the difference with SWIFT is that it will be censorship resistant and permissionless. 

How so? A hub screws you over and you can't settle on chain because you can't afford it. It's kind of like how a big company screws you over and their lawyers have strategies to delay a court case because they know that you will eventually go broke and have to drop your lawsuit. 

&gt; With huge server farms, on the other hand, the cost of entry into the ""business"" become extremely high, THAT is much like the current banking system. And guess what happens if all these huge miners gang up into a cartel? Crypto banking 2.0.

Cartels don't last. I trust miners more than hubs. If a miner wants to not mine my TX, another miner will. With LN hubs I would have to establish a channel with a new hub if I can even afford that. Mining is a centralizing force now but it doesn't mean it will stay that way.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2o71hh/physics_and_economics_will_distributed_mining_im/

&gt; See, you rally can't have it both ways. Either you impose a limit on the block size, and a fee market emerges. OR blocks are (potentially) unlimited, in which case you don't have a fee market. So that leads you to the manipulation of the miners described in the paper.

You're imagining every single TX will be included in block with no block limit. The reality is a bit different. There will be a lower limit to fees where the total revenue from fees must be higher than the cost to run a mining operation. A miner will not run at a loss. There will always be a backlog of TX because demand for it is infinite but the resources needed to provide that will not. A natural equilibrium will form because miners won't mine a TX with a fee that is not more than the cost to process and store a block.

&gt; If there is no block reward you get to the following scenario: Miner A just mined block N, which contained X in fees and left, say, only X/20 in fees in the mempool. As miner B, you have a choice on which block to mine: Block N or block N+1. Block N+1 has ~X/20 fees. However, block N has X fees up for grabs, as demonstrated by miner A's block. What is more profitable for miner B? Mind you, the pressure to mine block N+1 is no longer there because there is no block reward. Only miner A is incentivized to mine N+1, not everyone else. Miner B is actually incentivized to re-do the work for N, and then start working on his own N+1. And the same is true for every other miner, C, D, ... The conclusion is a tragedy of the commons where the network comes to a standstill as miners compete over a few most profitable blocks.

The reason I think it's wrong is because the assumption is that a miner can clear the mempool with an unlimited block size. But even in this scenario an equilibrium should form because even when the miners are undercutting each other by re-mining block N (they will keep mining smaller and smaller blocks in hopes that one miner will find that there is enough TX left by the previous miner to mine N+1 instead of trying to redo block N), new TX will be filling the mempool. But as I said in my previous I don't think bitcoin as used worldwide will have an empty mempool because of the fee floor imposed by the costs of mining hardware and operating costs.

Every major business already runs a database and it is part of their operating costs. Transferring any part of that database on a DLT will require a financial incentive long term - cost of electricity is not really a factor in this, transactions are not the point of databases. Immutable, trust less security is what would make a database valuable - something that is yet to be achieved on non DLT based level that Bitcoin has proven over the past 10 years.

"There is nothing hypocritical in the hodl mentality, people who promote spending for spending's sake do not understand where value comes from. The progression is novelty -&gt; store of value -&gt; means of exchange -&gt; unit of account.

Value is a function of desirability and scarcity. Ignoring the more advanced things that are possible, bitcoin is desirable because it can be securely stored and moved without 3rd party permission, and because it is scarce. 

Spending bitcoin does not increase its value. Spending for spending's sake may increase the liquidity of bitcoin - but generally it just increases the supply of people selling bitcoin in relation to the people buying which drives the price down. 

Bitcoin becomes more valuable when people produce things that others want and need and then are only willing to exchange those things for bitcoin. In that case any increased spending of bitcoin is driven by the creation of new value that pulls people into the bitcoin economy.

It makes very little sense to promote bitcoin by encouraging people to spend. A smart person would teach creative and productive people about the value of bitcoin as a savings and investment vehicle, and encourage them to accept bitcoin in exchange for their products and services.",1523470685

This is especially true as the rise in price starts to plateau as mass adoption happens. People will start to find the present value of other goods higher than the future value of the relative bitcoin. As far as spend/buy back the philosophy is the same regardless. Either you spend bitcoin to pay for goods and the merchants convert to local currencies or you sell bitcoin for local currency and spend. This is true regardless of how much bitcoin you own. Merchants already have methods of payment that work well for the majority currencies that people hold. They're not going to convert or add a new method of payment to accept bitcoin just because a few people ask for it. Once bitcoin is widely used as a store of value it will then start to be accepted more by merchants through efficient methods of payment like lightning network at which point bitcoin becomes a better medium of exchange.,1523469973

The bottom floor on bitcoin at that point would be caused by ensuring there are enough coins in circulation to handle the transactions needed. Today's there's about $1T in US FIAT to support our $18T economy. So by that measure, the market cap for bitcoin would simply need to be about 1/10 to 1/20 the total volume of bitcoin transactions in a day. 

On the other end, there is another interesting limit. A coin can only be split to 8 decimal places. A coin value over $1,000,000 would mean you can no longer represent a penny. So, while that's probably OK, there is going to be a theoretical limit. For example, we can't just say, the smallest transaction allowed is $10.

In economics, Gresham's law is a monetary principle stating that ""bad money drives out good"". For example, if there are two forms of commodity money in circulation, which are accepted by law as having similar face value, the more valuable commodity will disappear from circulation.

The law was named in 1860 by Henry Dunning Macleod, after Sir Thomas Gresham (1519–1579), who was an English financier during the Tudor dynasty. However, there are numerous predecessors.

"\&gt; This is the problem with a currency that rises in value year after year

Only if there are no alternatives.  No one says ""The problem with real estate is that it rises in value year over year"" or ""The problem with stocks is that it rises in value year over year"" or ""The problem with X commodity that is not fiat rises in value year over year"".  We have a pretty solid medium of exchange in the USD and the Euro and the Yen and other major currencies.  What we NEEDED was an alternative to these things.

Bitcoin is a medium of exchange and a store of value.  If the value drops over time \(say, by inflating supply\), it is not a good store of value.

USD is not a good store of value.  It has been designed to only be a medium of exchange.  The inflation rate is \*designed\* to increase its velocity so as to bolster its value as a medium of exchange, at the expense of its utility as a store of value.  This is designed to get people out of the USD and into other commodities, which increases the velocity and stimulates growth.

Bitcoin is not so compelled.  It is not a tool to increase the productivity of the country who issues it.  It is literally designed to be a store of value that is also easy to exchange.  That's the precise reason the protocol caps the supply.  ",1523469421

"""None of the cryptocurrencies are truly decentralized. They’re actually centrally controlled by the miners, who can basically rewrite history at will.""

*That* is bullshit. What -- bitcoin miners can rewrite the blockchain? No, they cannot. Weaver is either ignorant of his subject or consciously lying about it. 

""These systems require an obscene amount of energy to function."" *Obscene* is just his pejorative.  Electric signs and the World Series and the Super Bowl require lots of energy too. Miners, it should be noted, are willing to pay for that energy. They do so because the bitcoins they mine have a free-market value that is high enough to earn them a profit after expenses. 

""But why do you need such a system? Because you’re doing a transaction that a central authority would otherwise block, like paying off a hitman or buying drugs.""

More bullshit. The Nutty Professor seems wholly ignorant of how the bitcoin blockchain allows everyone to be their own notary public. I would challenge one of Weaver's students to ask him how that works. He will either not know and so be unworthy of his contract with the school as a ""researcher at the International Computer Science Institute at UC Berkeley [who] teaches a course on blockchains."" On the other hand, if he does know, it would instantly put the lie to his claim that public blockchains are only for those seeking illegal goods and services.

That same money is gone, but *waiting* to come back. Even for the strong hands, it's no fun buying at a dip just for it to dip more.

Maybe it's just a California thing (we are the tech capitol of the world, apple, Google, Facebook, Tesla, SpaceX, Dropbox, etc). It you know. 

Lightning WAS done while changing the block size. Segwit both increased the maximum block size to 4mb while allowing LN. Old nodes see the original 1mb, but can't see much of the data. The point is that if you use a btc client that is a version before BCH or Segwit existed, it still works on Bitcoin, even without Segwit. If there was a fork, this would not work. An old client from way back in the day still works now with this solution, and didn't cause a fork or new coins. Just like btc vs bch divided the community, forking it would mean it would have a new ALTCOIN while Bitcoin was still Bitcoin. Segwit solution ensured that anyone who didn't want to use it didn't have to, and also applied to original Bitcoin. 

Also, lightning fixed its problems. For example, if I wanted to send you one BTC routed through a friend, I would send him 1btc and he sends you 1 btc, but it requires him to have 1 btc. 

With the Atomic transactions, Lightning Mainnet can route through any non-zero channel. For example, if our friend has 0.1btc on my channel and 0.1btc on yours, I can route 1btc through him, but he'd just route in a triangle to rebalance. We'd have to pay 2(1/0.2) hops, so we'd be paying for 10 hops, but the point is that it's currently possible to do for 1/2 cent fee. The LN that was launched on testnet evolved greatly, imporving many of it's problems and protocol limitations. ",1523468213

I am just a person with my own opinions, and I don't think I'm the only one.

That brings us back to my initial point that your, 'you're either with us or against us' grouping of people is not accurate and had done great damage to the community as you have reacted to this perceived state by instituting some incredibly strong censorship on your own sub that led to a split of both the community and Bitcoin itself.",1523468206

"**Nordic model**

The Nordic model (also called Nordic capitalism or Nordic social democracy) refers to the economic and social policies common to the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway, Iceland, the Faroe Islands and Sweden). This includes a combination of free market capitalism with a comprehensive welfare state and collective bargaining at the national level with a high percentage of workers belonging to a labour union; and state provision of free education and free healthcare as well as generous, guaranteed pension payments for retirees funded by taxation. The Nordic model began to earn attention after World War II.

Although there are significant differences among the Nordic countries, they all share some common traits. These include support for a ""universalist"" welfare state aimed specifically at enhancing individual autonomy and promoting social mobility; a corporatist system involving a tripartite arrangement where representatives of labor and employers negotiate wages and labor market policy mediated by the government; and a commitment to widespread private ownership, free markets and free trade.

"The heart of this debate is that crypto-austrians believe that the value of Bitcoin is in it's financial sovereignty, aka it's ability to act as a store of value, protected by from the state. These are usually security maximalists, often called small blockers or decentralists.

Crypto-keynesians believe that the value of Bitcoin is derived from it's ability to fluidly transact, e.g as a medium of exchange. This group is usually referred to as big blockers, and put the ability to transact cheaply as higher priority than maximal security.

The meme has a valid point. You can be a crypto-austrian, spend, and then rebuy. It presents increased tax complications, extra time/labor, both of which can be rationalized if you are an avid Bitcoin supporter.

Jimmy Song [wrote a great article on the subject](https://medium.com/@jimmysong/segwit2x-post-mortem-divorce-of-crypto-austrians-and-crypto-keynesians-87960b11ce4c), and I think at the least we can walk away better educated and try to understand that both sides have the valid perspectives based on Modern economic theories.",1523467006

"The issue that the IRS faces, especially with crypto enthusiasts, is not so much about figuring out who dodged, but actually enforcing penalties after the fact. They are going to naturally prioritize wealthier entities/individuals first, which is why actual audits on average individuals are at extreme lows already.

So, once they got you on paper, now they need to *make* you pay, and the penalties are going to add up to outrageous amounts for many, amounts that would make a person resist by any means, because the threat is extreme (because the tax laws are extreme!). Now, there are ways to force you to pay, if you are hooked into the fiat system, have a job/business, etc. But what if you aren't and don't? What if you only keep small amounts in fiat and your real wealth in crypto, then they cannot make you pay everything, not if the accused are determined.

So then they can send you to jail, ok, might be a much better option than forfeiting just about everything you have worked for, esspecially when what you worked for is protected from this soul crushing theft, unless given up willingly.

Philosophically, a country is damaging itself if it creates too much burden on its own citizens, and has to lock many of them in jail for low quality reasons, regardless of monetary profits expected. It affects productivity, discourages risk taking and high volume action, so many negative side effects, and for what?

 So the IRS for all we know could ultimately play out to be a big bluff when the workload of prosecution becomes even heavier than it is now, and it's already too heavy.

"&gt;/r/humblebrag

Nothing humble about it. I'm *lamenting* the fact that despite my (publicly available and regularly pointed out) track record of later-proven-correct calls, there seems to be a never-ending supply of fools (like you!) who ignore it and try to mock those who have been trying to point these things out (*in advance and with regularity*) for years now.

&gt;Any moron who has a correct understanding of monetary economics should be able to see that a deflationary currency is going to....well, deflate.

A few things to note here. Bitcoin is technically *disinflationary* at this time, if we're talking about supply inflation (which is distinct from *deflationary*). If you're talking about price deflation, then you are arguing that ""any moron should be able to see that Bitcoin will go up in price"" which is not at all true, and a point of massive dispute (and if it *were* so obvious, we would see effectively-immediate hyperbitcoinization as a result). Most people *don't* believe that Bitcoin is going to continue rising in price (despite its supply growth curve) and this is absolutely a niche opinion right now. Of course, most people don't have ""a correct understanding of monetary economics"" either, but that brings us to yet *another* point: such a thing probably does not objectively exist, anyway.

So many little giveaways in this tiny sentence... I remember when the trolls used to show glimmers of intelligence.  Better times.

&gt;The amount of coins not mined due to the halvening, is not solely sufficient to explain the the rise.

It's not the sole factor, no, and I never made that claim.

&gt;There must be something more here...perhaps the market is demanding bitcoin more because it is starting to come to the inevitable conclusion that Bitcoin will dominate the world economy.

There's a bit of that going on, too. But it's a slow process, and it's more like ""cosmic Bitcoin background radiation"" that is more useful for years-to-decades price extrapolations than it is for the near- or mid-term. 

&gt;As for ""calling the pop"", this is utter nonsense and you should be mocked.

Not sure what you're trying to mock, exactly. I didn't call the exact top of the 2013 bubble, but I called that the bubble would occur (and pass $1000, due to a East-West ""feedback loop"" because China was finally starting to play the Bitcoin game) when the price was still hovering above $100, and correctly predicted that the most likely end of the cycle would be caused by regulatory/legislative clamp-down (remember the ""China bans Bitcoin!"" scares, anyone?)... and more recently, when redditors asked me ""Can you share some of your future predictions"" [I said](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hplk4/remember_if_you_only_knew_last_weeks_lottery/dqtpiv5/):

&gt;The one prediction I *do* have to share is something no one wants to hear right now: this incredible exponential price growth we've been seeing in Bitcoin *will* end, and the market will correct downwards *violently*. And I don't mean a 20-30% drop, I mean a 60-90% drop, where true despair sets in and everyone who hasn't been through a Bitcoin bear market before (and even some who have) feel the *other* side of holding Bitcoin. Many will sell every satoshi they own, and say ""I knew it was a scam all along"" and kick themselves for ever getting involved... it's coming. I don't know if **the drop will come after a top at $12k, or at $20k, or even at $30k, but I am confident beyond confident that it will come sometime in the next few months. It won't be the end of Bitcoin's amazing growth (though it might feel like it), so those who truly take the long-term outlook will benefit from it... 

Note that despite never having claimed to be able to call an exact top, the ""$20k top"" is right there, the exact middle prediction, made while the price was still in the $11k range. Note also that I included a disclaimer warning readers that the prediction wasn't precisely tradeable, and though I nailed the order of magnitude pretty impressively (and even got the timeframe eerily right), it wasn't a prediction that allows you to base your day trades perfectly on.

Going back to even older posts, I was arguing that we'd very likely see prices north of $10k within 2 years of the 2016 halvening, *over a year before the halvening occurred*, so let's just get that out of the way now and save you from some doomed goalpost-shifting nonsense before it begins.

&gt;If you have been making correct price direction and magnitude calls since 2013, you should have been able be a billionaire by now, and yet you aren't.

Not only is that a ridiculous conclusion in the first place and basically just childish hyperbole, but you have no idea what my financial situation is like and I have no intention of being baited by an obvious troll into disclosing it anyway.

Like I said, these predictions are publicly verifiable for anyone who cares to check (or even ask), but instead of curiosity or recognition I am more often met with crude and ignorant attempts at derision, of which you're an excellent example.",1523465520

"I've been trying to explain this to a lot of people, but this concept seems to be one that humans have a hard time understanding.

Remember the old chain letter thing. You would get a letter telling you to send $5 to five addresses. Then you would put your name at the bottom of the letter and mail it to 5 people shifting everyone else's names up the list. The idea was that as it trickled up, everyone would get mega wealthy. The part nobody seemed to understand is that the only money in the system was the money other speculators like you put into the system. (Ponzi scheme/pyramid scheme)

Amway took this idea to a new level saying ""buy from us and then get other people to do the same"". At least in that case, people were purchasing actual products they would use, but the concept was the same. Nearly nobody bought from Amway unless they were part of the system or a close relative. 

Bitcoins are the same. You are swapping money with other speculators. The only money coming out of the system is the money going into the system. If you and 20 friends all decided a dog turd was worth $100 to each other only, it would only last until one of you sold the dog turd to another and then left the system. 

Stocks and bonds are backed by companies that make real money outside of the stock market. They provide goods and services that they then earn from and you own a piece of that or they are indebted to you. Commodities are real goods that are really consumed by people, and you just bet on a value being attained or maintained in this process. Even currency trading is typically backed by industries that need to exchange goods in this currency. For example, if a country wants to buy gasoline from the USA, they need to buy dollars first and then buy the gasoline with those dollars. The only markets that you MUST use bitcoin for are the black market and online gambling right now. That's it! It's a tiny niche at best, and 99% of the value is because of speculation.",1523464823

Before being arrogant I suggest learning a little bit of technical analysis before saying that a 60% bear market correction is over.

It's like everyone on this fucking subreddit thinks that just because you think a bear trend is continuing that it's FUD and you hate crypto. That's so stupid. Like just read the fucking charts. It's an objective look at trends. We all know crypto is going to grow and recover but there's no use going against the current trend.

Btw everything going sideways is barely bullish only because it's been sideways for so long. IMO everything looks a lot better than it has and I think there's a 20-30% chance that we're at the end of the bear market.",1523464797

"Basically everything is patented. Now I agree it's mostly bullshit patents, but that 's basically all software patents. Software is ideas and math and was never meant to be patented. But that 's another discussion.

As soon as you hit someone with a patent lawsuit, you're going to have countersuits. To protect against large corporations with tens or hundreds thousand patents, most open source companies pool together their patents. If you assign your patent to that pool, you basically can use all the patents in the pool in countersuits.

Most open source companies, including Blockstream, think patents are evil, but accept It's necessary for defensive purposes. See Blockstreams patent pledge.

Licensing patents exclusively to entities will have you be shunned in open source circles. This is one of the main reason for the hostility to covert ASICBOOST, and the reason nChain patented software on BCH will be shunned. It's not open any more, It's closed. It's against the permissiveless nature of Bitcoin, too.

"&gt;why does the price go up?

Well I'll start by saying it doesn't go up because people love trading it away for goods. Maybe in the future, but we aren't there yet.

The price goes up because more and more people prefer to store their value in Bitcoin as opposed to fiat or other investment vehicles. You gonna hold Bitcoin, capped at 21m supply, or are you gonna hold the ever inflating fiat?

&gt;why do people want to use it?

To store their value and protect their wealth in a post 2008 crisis world. People are waking up to how central banking has been robbing them of their wealth for decades.

Also because it is pseudo anonymous and permission-less. The best applications for Bitcoin purchases and transactions are ones in which fiat does not work. Darkweb, internet gambling, moving value from one website or exchange to another, etc..

It's not because ""cheap and fast!"", that's for damn sure. It's not cheaper. It's not faster. It certainly could be one day though! 

The world had no shortage of cheap and fast payment mechanisms back before Bitcoin was invented. If you think Satoshi created Bitcoin to compete with 2% merchant-side credit card fees.... well you missed what makes bitcoin revolutionary my friend.

Want proof that Bitcoin's value has almost no relation to the number of merchants accepting it and the number of people using it to buy legal goods and services? Well merchant adoption and legal goods purchasing with bitcoin peaked in 2014-2015. What more proof do you need?

Nevertheless bitcoins seem to be very good for gambling: buy BTC at one price, with the hope (gambling) of later dumping it at a higher price (i.e. real money) on some late-arrival sucker.     

Considering the above, hodling appears to be the only sensible option.  That is, until one gets to the point we are not at, of BTC going to the dogs (i.e. its real value of zero).   

So, at the present, there are actually three options to be considered: spend, hodl, dump.   Only the last is sensible.",1523461690
"Agreed on the first point about the echo chambers. However, time is linear. If BTC came out in 2009 and BCH in 2017...you'd have to check my math but I think that means BTC is the original. Plus, everybody means BTC when they say ""Bitcoin."" I've travelled the world to crypto conferences and not one person ever called BCH ""Bitcoin."" It is called ""Bitcoin Cash."" Forever and always. Even if Bitcoin dies you still won't be able to take its name. In fact, there are many people I met who think BCH is better than BTC and that BTC is dragging their feet, but even they don't get dragged into the politics of the naming convention. You guys are just being petty (and somehow dragging me into it....I am ashamed haha)",1523461667

You can use you're GVT tokens to invest in professional managers who can trade in forex,cryptos,metals etc. In the demo there were mangers who had made over 300% gains in a matter of days. GVT also has a very low supply which I don't think people understand makes this token so much more valuable, if GVT were to have a 10b market cap that would put the price of 1 GVT token at $2685, this is totally possible in a few years time, there are shitcoins with no working product whose market cap has reached 10b.

There are plenty of bitcoin's incentives assumptions that have been proven wrong in time. This is not how you do OPsec.

Unbelievable that the investment sentiments change the moment we see 5-6% increase when this has happened like 10 times in the past several weeks. You don't need a crystal ball to predict that BTC will likely rise to 7-7.2 and then drop to 6.5-6.6 again (and alts that had a nice increase over the past week suffer the most).

You are also misunderstanding what it means to use money.  A person does not use money when they buy something; that is when they STOP using money.

"I am CEO and founder of BETR and Better Betting, so please take my comments in context.  Naturally I was not happy to see your negative review and thought it only reasonable to respond to your points.

Poor whitepaper - this is a subjective comment and I take it on board.  In essence the whitepaper was provided for the ICO and is no longer a living document - the website will provide the most recent information.

Scammy - I take exception with that statement.  We have been above board and open with our community, particularly on telegram, and have provided regular updates through the website, through community emails and on the telegram an Twitter groups. The product is in development - some pieces are more complete than others.  We committed to deliver a MVP for the World Cup which we will do.

3 Team members - not true although I would agree that we could provide more team information and bios on the website and we will work on that.  We have a team of between 10 and 20 on the project at the moment (some are part time or contract resources) and are flat out on delivering as per the roadmap.  We also have an extremely strong stakeholder base, from the public advisors to initial investors - many of who are major players in this industry.

I think the latter is one point where we differ significantly from many of our ""competitors"" - our industry experience is second to none and it will show in the products we release and penetration in the marketplace that we achieve.

On the competitors you mention some in the article and there are more in the comments. The bulk of them are either theoretical wagering plays (Augur and to some degree Peerplays) or sports books which use crypto to avoid regulation (Wagerr) or are regulated (and not really decentralised) - these models not being applicable to what we are doing.  We take no risk, no margin and minimal fees and provide a transparent and fair way to place a bet with an unknown party, with integration APIs for existing sports books and exchanges to lay their prices.  As such we are more a communication and settlement mechanism than a sports book albeit it one with sports betting focus.

"It is a general rule of thumb that my finance professor used to talk about. I don’t remember where he got it from, but I have heard it many times since then. The idea being that the younger you are the more you should allocate towards risky investments because if you lose your ass on a risky investment you have more time to recover losses than someone who is about to retire. It isn’t a perfect rule as it doesn’t account for each persons own thoughts in regards to risk adversity, but it does set you up to potentially net large gains over the course of your investing career. With that said, in the traditional sense of this application a “safe” investment might be land or gold and a “risky” investment might be a stock. My application here is leaning HEAVILY on the risk side of things since even the safest of crypto investments is riskier than anything on the S&amp;P 500 vaguely speaking.

"Block size limit increase would be meaningful. Weight increase is just changing accounting units. Weight is not measured in megabytes, it's weight units. You can change weight without changing block size limit. You could say btc has 8 million weight units right now but no it does not increase tx throughput. Bcash's 8mb block size limit allows for way more transactions to be confirmed in a saturated network scenario. Bcash is not any ""faster"" however, unless their mining algo is fucked up, which wouldn't surprise me as they already broke it once with EDA.

On chain transaction ""speed"" thing.. First of all, transactions are not uniform in size. Using TPS is like measuring # of steps in a mile and would give you various answers depending on how big the steps are. Transaction is valid if it is included in a block. Blocks are found 10 min apart on average. Transaction ""speed"" does not make much sense since you're always ~10 min away from a confirmation. The issue arises when demand for block space is high and many transactions are waiting to be confirmed. Those who don't need fast confirmation, or rely on the wallet to guess fees may have to wait a long time for confirmation if there are lots of high fee transactions ahead of them. Those who are in a hurry and can look up the state of the network in real time, can include correct fee (which may be quite high) and be included in the next block. Transaction ""speed"" is a function of how many transactions are in the queue and how much the sender is willing to pay in fees.",1523459189

But eventually we want to transition from using Crypto to pay for things also. By contributing now, even if just a little, you help doing that faster. 


See, there's no pressure attached. If you think we should use more crypto as pay, as it currently is, then you should want to help out in that regard too and it literally costs nothing to do. 


Not being able to pay is a flat lie. Various phone apps, secure enough for a little dinner amount of Bitcoin to store - you know - good enough security for small amounts of money. Pay with it, if you feel like it, and of course like you said, if you can. 


No pressure. Maybe use it for fun sometime? I mean sure, not all stores offer stuff in Bitcoin, but *some* do right? 


Also not advocating that doing either or is better, because it goes back to what I originally said, that it grows anyways. So no hard feelings if you decide not to.

They have ZERO plans to ever fully support BCH in the proper way.

"/r/humblebrag 

Any moron who has a correct understanding of monetary economics should be able to see that a deflationary currency is going to....well, deflate.  The amount of coins not mined due to the halvening, is not solely sufficient to explain the the rise.  There must be something more here...perhaps the market is demanding bitcoin more because it is starting to come to the inevitable conclusion that Bitcoin will dominate the world economy.

As for ""calling the pop"", this is utter nonsense and you should be mocked.  If you have been making correct price direction and magnitude calls since 2013, you should have been able be a billionaire by now, and yet you aren't.  ",1523457850

"I think this is a fair criticism, but I would point out that I have never held any of the coins that I discuss in this post. If I did, I would disclose it. I also only got into the market this February, so I'm not too worried that I've lost money thus far. 

As far as what makes me believe that coins will continue to have value, I don't think there are any concrete reasons for most cryptocoins (including BTC) to have much, if any, value right now. That said, I think the value they currently have is based on market expectations of future performance and usage--expectations which could be wrong. I consider the current crypto market to be somewhere between scratch-off lottery tickets and the stock market, meaning that it's not suitable as the primary vehicle for a person's investments. That said, I think it could still make some serious money in the long term. ",1523457845

"This is a great question. I would talk to a crypto tax preparer. If you live by a major city, you should be able to find them. 

Chances are with that kind of money, you will absolutely be creating a pass through LLC. That’s my guess. So I’d talk to them first and then go from there. It would be much easier withdrawing to a “business account” than a personal account when we are talking about that much money. ",1523457812
"Ok, fair enough. Have fun carefully wording things when expressing your sane but unpopular opinion. I’m afraid it won’t do much good, but I commend your effort. 

As Andreas Antonopoulos said:

“The only thing that mattered in this debate was the opinion of the 3-4 developers who did not want any process that actually resulted in anything but what they had already decided. They twisted, turned and rationalized, but in the end did exactly what they intended from the beginning: censorship of particular opinions by exclusion and decree. 

All hail our new overlords. They're not just coders, they are press directors and OWN bitcoin. As they often say, if you don't like it... fork. “

This is meant for people who see bitcoin as an investment but still want to contribute in using it as intended, as a currency.

People who are struggling financially should in my opinion not buy bitcoin at all. If you’re not able or willing to lose it because you need it to live, don’t buy bitcoin with it. 

Get paid in bitcoin and then it gets interesting because then, you’ll have the difficulty of selling bitcoin for fiat because you need fiat for some things in life without being able to replace it because you have no fiat.",1523457707

Let me teach you a little something about the world. The wealthiest people in the world are conservatives, by far. They are also the slowest and last to move, by far. The wealthy conservatives in america and beyond control the world economy. When they decide to buy your precious crypto again, then maybe you just might see 20k again.

"The truth is Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin both cannot be scaled to truly work as a worldwide digital cash system in their current forms.  They cant handle the throughput.  The scaling issue wasnt solved with big blocks, it was a stop gap.  Both can be used for transactions like cash.  With lightning youll be able to pay in micro-cents for a transaction as well as a cup of coffee or an entire island.  The scaling issue wasnt something that was going to be solved simply by increasing block size.  The problem with the 2 communities is the core developers move slower, are more methodical and are more precise when it comes to protocol development and the ABC crowd wanted big blocks now.  It was the cautious vs the impatient.

One thing the rush in December proved across the entire space is that crypto is not ready for the mainstream.   We couldnt onramp the users when they were ready to buy.  All the exchanges froze trying to sign up new users.  The fact is the infrastructure isn't ready for mainstreaming.  We've still got years of development ahead to truly have a crypto that can replace Visa/Mastercard or debit.

BTC can be a store of value, a medium of exchange, and a currency.  Its just not geared to handling small size transactions at the moment.  It's better for larger transactions with significant value attached, like international trade and commerce, cars, houses, etc.  With lightning that will extend to candy bars, coffee and micropayments for streaming media.  The white paper is a document expressing the goals of the project, and the project keeps moving to fulfill those goals, its just an iterative process that takes time and precision and caution because any changes made to the protocol could wreak havoc and cause losses destroying the argument its viable for anything.",1523457608

"This volume is relatively small compared to what it was.

If you check the charts, there seem to be an average correlation of about $1,000 BTC price per $1BN daily trading volume. 
When Bitcoin was about 17k-19k, the volume was about 17BN. Mid January the price was 13k with 12BN volume.

Recently the price is moving around 6.5-7k with volume around or under 5k.

The trading volume has gone down significantly, nobody seem to want to trade. Most people are waiting for some kind of confirmation about reversal of the bear trend.

I personally use the trading volume as indicator about the market sentiment (not the price itself). That saves me many troubles with artificial pump and dumps on low volume.

"Got out of Crypto in 2015. Sold off my 10 bitcoins and was happy that I had almost doubled my investment. I took that money and paid down my car loan. I was pretty happy, until bitcoin went to the moon...

Started looking at crypto again back in December when everything was crazy. Held off buying until last month. Slowly phasing in some of my “disposable” income that *was* going to go toward a new motorcycle in an attempt get my feet wet again. 

Putting 20% in ADA, 25% in Ethereum, 20% in stellar, 20% in IOTA, 10% in Vechain, 5% in Chainlink. I figure Ethereum to be the safest of those investments and the rest to be quite risky. 

Going off the (100%) - (Age as a %) = $ to devote to high risk investment rule I feel like I am not being too insane. The goal for the year would be to take 2x whatever I invest in crypto and invest in Index funds just in case I lose my ass. At least then I will still be saving a nice chunk of money.

"This is a huge problem with regards to Bitcoin. It is difficult to find a good cash out exchange. I have read alot about Bitstamp closing accounts of people who want to withdraw large amounts of fiat.

I would say try maybe Bitfinex, I have deposited fiat with them no problem but I haven't actually withdrawn fiat from them so I can't say 100% that they also won't close your account. But I haven't seen any complaints with fiat withdrawals on Bitstamp.

I personally use Luno in South Africa. I can withdraw up to ~ $1 million fiat per day. They action withdrawals twice a day. ",1523457469

"Rather than getting caught up in the ""will they, won't they deliver a bigger, faster, stronger mining rig""... It's important to take the longer view here and recognise how the mining space is evolving. 

Consumer-level chips in everything from toasters and washing machines to your smartphone and laptop will no doubt be commonplace, and lead to total decentralisation of the mining space.

AMD, Nvidia and Intel are also all making interesting noises about all this.

Here's a link to a discussion around Chinese domestic appliance giant Midea, who are looking to embed mining chips in household appliances:

""The method comprises the following steps: controlling network access of the household appliance, and logging in a Bitcoin account via the household appliance, wherein the Bitcoin account is an account preregistered in a Bitcoin [mining] website; driving a controller of the household appliance to [mine] coins in the Bitcoin [mining] website, and storing the ... Bitcoins into a Bitcoin wallet corresponding to the Bitcoin account.""

And here's a cool little [prototype of a bitcoin mining lightbulb](https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/launching-high-tech-product-easy-screwing-lightbulb) that was built on Necker Island by BitFury. There were/are plans to mass produce these.

When thinking about how all this will eventually play out, I think Ray Kurzweil (Futurist, Inventor, Director of Google engineering) nailed it:

"I’m saying that retarded moon kids are the reason why xvg is still going up. They’re the reason ONT is outperforming everything for no reason other than the fact that it’s going up. You can’t justify these types of returns in this type of market even for crypto.

"Whining about BTC fees being expensive relative to BCH (actually, they're roughly the same right now) without acknowledging the tradeoff between scaling and decentralization is silly. If BCH actually saw any significant volume, it'd be nothing more than a centralized database.

But in reality, BCH has negligibile volume. It's an empty highway. There are more SegWit BTC transactions every block than the total # of BCH transactions. ",1523457056

"It doesn't really matter, because if by the time you plan to move these coins somebody trivially reverses ECDSA, you're going to have to publicly reveal your pubkey anyway in the tx itself. 

If anything, simply being on BTC is the security hole itself, because full mining nodes don't follow first-seen policy, allowing this kind of attacker to double-spend you, assuming they can reverse ECDSA in time to double-spend (which is also helped out by the fact that in periods of high volume, the BTC mempool does not get cleared out efficiently anyway).",1523456973

One day a dollar can buy a cheap loaf of bread the next day it might be $1.09 this is something barely noticeable, in fiat, because you are faced with so many things fluctuating in price you seldom will notice major price hikes except on your favorite items. 

Sometimes the consumer markups also allow companies to provide a static price for long periods of time, but that just means you have been overpaying for that item until you notice the price hike. 
Still every all fiat currencies are losing value at an accelerating rate. Cryptocurrency is still having to bid against speculation, commodities, fiat currencies, and adoption.",1523456858

From another angle, BTC may become wildly successful at... something. But it won’t be global p2p cash. Maybe global corporate cash? I personally think that BTC is very much the emperor with no clothes and that BCH will be one of those rare cases where the “good guys” will win.",1523456851

They have been used in trade by the Yapese as a form of currency. The monetary system of Yap relies on an oral history of ownership.

Because both have different properties, which are described in the white paper and some Dymaxion Layers may require one **OR** another.

Contrary to the synchronous blockchain with its 4-minute metronome, the DAGs work asynchronously and are basically limited by network latencies. That's pretty ""lightning"". As a Dymaxion layer forms a bidirectional payment channel network, we simply borrowed that term ""Lightning Network"" from Bitcoin - as a marketing term.

Its not just iota either. All sorts of coins and erc20 tokens have had questionable beginnings, or exposure of some shady behavior. You bring it up and the shills and fanboys pop up out the woodwork. ""Fundamentals are the same"" is my favorite.

Here's something interesting to think about: 90% of all crypto projects are complete scams. *This is an unregulated securities market*. All coins and tokens aren't securities, but most of them coming out in the last 2 years are. Of course 90% of them will be scams.

If a network has 1 thing at all that is shady, you should drop it like a hot potato. Always be skeptical. Especially in this market. If you rationalize anything away, you're stupid.

"Cryptomininggame a fun way to earn cash

It is more game-oriented, you can virtually undermine (the CPU is not used), and accomplish missions to increase your level.
In its new version, it is also possible to actually mine (from level 5).

It is also possible to make a deposit to buy virtual hash power without a minimum deposit amount.
The site offers to win bitcoin, litecoin and doge at any level, and also cash dash, ether and bitcoin premium (ie if you have a hash power greater than 1000).

The minimum withdrawal is 50,000 satoshis, 400,000 litoshi and 100 doge. By raising its level in the game it can be done quickly enough.
Payments are now made twice a week.
You can trade your coins on the site to reach the withdrawal threshold more quickly (according to calculation, the fees are about 12%).
There is also a daily bonus that can recover satoshi, crystals, hash power or energy, not to forget, because it rises fast enough (multiplier depending on the number of consecutive days).
A lottery for those who want to try their luck.
You can earn 10% of the earnings of your referrals with sponsorship

This faucet is quite innovative in its use is gives a playful side, the site is quite easy to use and the design is nice. I hope it will become a safe bet.

"What you think it was meant ot achieve certainly affects whether you think it was a success. There's a variety of views you could take:

* It was a plan to either get 2MB and segwit, or neither. That's the game theory you need for ""let's make a deal"" proposals, which was what segwit2x seemed to be to me. We got one but not the other (and the other but not the one if you count Bcash) so this plan was an obvious (double!) failure.
* It was an attempt to do two separate things: get segwit, and get 2MB; if so, it was definitely a partial failure in that it didn't get 2MB, and given every block complied with UASF rules, its contribution to getting segwit activated seems at best only minor (heh). If this was the plan, I think it's fair to say the ""segwit"" part succeeded, and the ""2x"" part failed, so complaining that people call it ""just 2x"" isn't very fair.
* It was an attempt to prevent bitcoin from having a permanent fork. It completely failed at this.
* It provided political cover for the UASF flag day that was already underway. If this was the goal, it seems like it was a success, but maybe one that's hard to admit in public.
* It was an attempt to fire core and move control of the reference client to a new, friendlier group. Total failure.
* It was an attempt to keep controversy going to keep attention on bitcoin, and keep eyeballs and awareness. Seems like a success?
* It was an attempt to keep controversy going to suppress the price prior to a big post-segwit rise. Huge success!

A second important reason to abbreviate segwit2x as ""2x"" is that everywhere people talk these days has character limits...

In any event, it's a dead proposal, there's no need to keep defending it. Treat it like you would any rejected PR: be grateful for the lessons you learned, take the feedback you got on board and try again later with a better plan that maybe other people will like, or if you think the rejection was wrong, work on a different project.

"&gt;It's open source. LN can work on BCH once there's a malleability fix.

Of course it can work on BCH, never said it can't. But what you seem to be missing is that **someone needs to work on it**. Someone must spend countless hours to adapt the open-source code so it works on BCH. Which is not just copy-pasting code, because the malleability fix won't be the same.

&gt;Yes, and when will those supposed useful stuff come out built on those LApps? Ain't nobody got time for that.

I think this is at the core of the entire controversy - This presumed urgency. Well, I claim there is no urgency. The urgency has been entirely fabricated. You don't believe me? How many times did you hear the old lady get out of her corner convenience store ranting about how she couldn't get her groceries with Bitcoin? Old lady not fitting? OK, how about college kids? How often do you hear anything like that? My bet is that you've never heard it. Or if you did, you remeber **exactly** how many times AND the circumstances, because it's such a rare occurrence. 

Reality is that the economy is happily chugging along with fiat. And would continue to do so even without cryptos.

As for ""Moar babies are dying"" cries, I reject this with the strongest possible force. No, I don't think crypto should only be for the rich nations, and I do see how this amazing tech will help impoverished countries leapfrog setting up a banking sector like you have in the US, much to their own benefit. But I reject that **WE** must solve **THEIR** problems. It is not **OUR RESPONSIBILITY** to fix Venezuela's problems. Or Zimambwe's. Or any other nation on Earth. Countries fuck up on their own, and it was always on them to sort themselves out. As is right. Sure, crypto will help in this, but it on their own people to throw a fucking revolution, if they are unhappy with their situation. Fuck, America did it! France did it! Russia did it! (At some point in their history.) 

So no, it's not on us to solve their problems.

&gt;Again, you don't think there will be any software optimizations when it gets to that point? Look up parallel validation. I am against stagnating because of some possible fears that people have.

Moore's law only continues to hold because of various software optimizations, including parallel computations. The key problem is the rate of growth of the blockchain. The sheer size of the blockchain. Which needs to be a) downloaded, and b) validated. *Even if validation was instantaneous, you still need to download it*. And if the blockchain grows faster than broadband improves, you have a problem. You have not addressed this point. And, of course, even Moore's law is not unlimited, and the software improvements are already included in the current version of the law. Else it'd be already dead.

Blockchain growth/bloat is a problem, a real problem. Have a look at [this](https://dev.to/5chdn/the-ethereum-blockchain-size-will-not-exceed-1tb-anytime-soon-58a). Last year, on modern consumer grade hardware and broadband, it was **not possible to sync ETH's archivial nodes from scratch**. This is not apples-for-apples, I know, but think about it for a bit... You cannot sync ETH's full blockchain TODAY. Thankfully they rely on state-nodes to run the show, which are much smaller, or ETH would be dead in the water. Bitcoin doesn't have this luxury. The takeaway is that blockchain bloat is a real problem.

&gt;How do you guarantee it? Sorry, I don't see it.

How do I guarantee that there won't be 1 million independent miners running huge server farms? Do I really need to answer that?

&gt;I see your scenario as the new SWIFT for banks. Unaffordable onchain fees for the regular person. How much do you think it will be?

On-chain txs fees will be high, absolutely. But the difference with SWIFT is that it will be censorship resistant and permissionless. With huge server farms, on the other hand, the cost of entry into the ""business"" become extremely high, THAT is much like the current banking system. And guess what happens if all these huge miners gang up into a cartel? Crypto banking 2.0.

&gt;It's a free market competition not a centrally made decision. That's the difference. When it's centrally limited, people will go looking elsewhere and they did.

See, you rally can't have it both ways. Either you impose a limit on the block size, and a fee market emerges. OR blocks are (potentially) unlimited, in which case you don't have a fee market. So that leads you to the manipulation of the miners described in the paper.

&gt;Care to point out the section? Or give me a layman's summary? Maybe I misunderstood the paper.

If **there is no block reward** you get to the following scenario: Miner A just mined block N, which contained X in fees and left, say, only X/20 in fees in the mempool. As miner B, you have a choice on which block to mine: Block N or block N+1. Block N+1 has ~X/20 fees. However, block N has X fees up for grabs, as demonstrated by miner A's block. What is more profitable for miner B? Mind you, the pressure to mine block N+1 is no longer there because there is no block reward. Only miner A is incentivized to mine N+1, not everyone else. Miner B is actually incentivized to re-do the work for N, and then start working on his own N+1. And the same is true for every other miner, C, D, ... The conclusion is a tragedy of the commons where the network comes to a standstill as miners compete over a few most profitable blocks.

The way out? There are two. One, introduce a constant block reward. Aka inflation. I'm *personally* not really against that, especially because the inflation rate is *decreasing* in time if the block reward is *contstant*, say 1BTC/block. But many don't share my view and the most likely outcome is that it won't be introduced. So you reach a no-block reward state. What then? The only way to incentivize miners to keep building on the previous block is if there is a **healthy txs fee backlog**. OK, so Miner A got X in fees? I'll work on the next block and I know I can get ~X myself, thus extending the blockchain. 

In other words, you are quite literally paying the miners to maintain security out of your own pocket, since there is no money printing anymore. And if you think about it, it only makes sense we'll need to keep rewarding the miners ourselves as users once the block reward dwindles. Or they'll go do something else.

&gt;Fiat doesn't work fine for a lot of people. I'm just not entirely sure when 'prime time' for BTC is.

Don't disagree... but see my point above about the fabricated urgency. I don't see this rush to adopt cryptos. Not even today, after a manic 2017, let alone a year ago when the debate was raging.

&gt;Adoption of LN will take years. LN running on a cheaper, faster chain would render LN on BTC moot. A reserve coin isn't really a problem more of crypto should make a reserve anything extinct.

2018 is the year of LN adoption. There are already ~1600 nodes on main net. Those LApps were just released, and people are starting to work on them. By end of 2019 LN will be very wide spread.

&gt;This is what I hear all the time. I ask, then, what is the definition of decentralized? What is decentralized enough? How many mining nodes per million people? I say again, decentralization is a sliding scale, not a binary outcome.

It's not about mining nodes only, but about full validating, non-mining nodes. Otherwise you can never be ""your own bank"". And if, one day, people could run a fully validating node on their phones, with tech increase and keeping the blockchain small, that would be the ultimate decentralization.

&gt;May the best coin change the world.

Agreed 100%!!!

&gt;	Our current system works on making and borrowing money out of thin air and it works because the money loses value every year

Sure. Thats how growing capitalistic economies work. Its a simplified view, but alright. Whats the system that you want to replace it with?

&gt;	There can be a lot of good done if banks only borrowed money that they actually owned

Why? What good comes of that? I get that it *feels* better if a bank holds all its liabilities all the time. But it needs some actual hard benefits before we would adopt something like this. Would it improve growth? No. Would it decrease unemployment? No. It would be effectively equivalent to the federal reserve setting a reserve requirement of 100%. To give you an idea of how drastic that is, that’s a 90% increase from its current value. The closest we’ve ever been to being so extreme was raising the requirement by 50% in the ‘30s which exacerbated the Great Depression. 

&gt;	Let’s try it and see what happens, pretty sure an easy way to combat the “people won’t spend deflationary currency” is to include tax incentives for spending certain amounts in brackets/tiers and each one gives you a little discount on your taxes.

So now we’re fighting poor monetary policy with fiscal policy. Ok. We’re going to cut taxes to incentivize spending. In a normal ecomomy, you can cut taxes and this will increase spending. Issue here is that the US government isn’t able to accrue debt like normal because we arent allowed to borrow out of thin air anymore. So they need to cut spending at an equivalent rate which is going to slow growth. Also, you’ve got a ton of unintended consequences falling out o this. First, you’re actually creating the opposite effect of what you want. Lets say you want to invest 10 dollars and you get a tax discount of 10% of your purchase. You could make that investment and get a 1 dollar tax break. Or you could wait a year, have the capacity to spend 12 dollars and get a 1.2 dollar tax break. You havent fixed the problem, youve exacerbated it. Second, by creating a bracketed system where people that spend *more* get a *higher* tax rate, you’re essentially creating a regressive tax which is just horrible by any standards. 

Also, again, the issue with “let’s just try it” is that bitcoin offers no out. There’s no way to see signs of failure and attempt any sort of correction. Nobody can touch monetary policy with bitcoin; its one of its “””features”””. It’s literally the “let’s not try monetary policy” of currencies. 

&gt;	The other interesting thing is from lots of people I have spoken to, none of them knew that the US dollar is inflationary and that they lose 3% of their purchasing power every year, the reason they spend is because they want to

Ok yeah. Some people are fucking morons. These people aren’t significantly affecting the economy. Just because most people drooled their way through high school civics doesn’t mean that investors, businesses, and people that actually affect economic growth aren’t affected by it. Joe Shmo might not  consciously choose to by more hot dogs one year to the next. But a million Joe Shmos are going to statistically buy more when Oscar Meyer invests in a manufacturing process that makes hot dog production cheaper. 

Also, the nice thing about banks is that you aren’t losing a significant amount of purchasing power every year. Banks offer interest rates on savings. So yeah, if you’re dumb and you hold all your money in your wallet, you’re losing money. Otherwise, you’re fine. 

&gt;	In the end, it doesn’t matter, the point is, Bitcoin lets you own and control your money and that is something powerful and never before seen.

Boy howdy. I didn’t know if i should address this as a legitimate argument or ignore it. But I’ll address it. You can’t just say “in the end, it doesn’t matter because it’s cool”. What doesn’t matter? Economic stability doesnt matter? People living in poverty doesn’t matter? Modern standards of living don’t matter?  Also, what do you mean by “bitcoin is the first currency you can own and control”? You can’t control anything related to bitcoin supply. You can control how you spend it, but you can do that with USD. What makes it more controllable than any other currency?",1523451896
"&gt; an assumption Satoshi mentioned throughout the white paper

Here's the thing about that assumption. It's not a monolithic mechanism that stops all kinds of malfeasance 100% of the time. We have had miners mine empty blocks, and if what you argue were, this wouldn't be happening, for instance. Another example is what we saw with the whole scaling debate itself. According to satoshi's ""follow the profits"" assumption, miners should not have sticked with Core for so long contrary to their economic insterests. Hell, at times there was quite a bit of miner discrepancy, and it took the Sw2x ruse in order to get them onboard with that.

The incentives of bitcoin work at many levels with varying degrees of effectiveness, but at the bottom of it all, miners never have the power to appropriate funds from users, for instance. Cryptography is the main underpinning of bitcoin despite all incentives working *most of the time*.

The argument that a miner ""would never do that due to the reaction other miners might have"" is a good argument, but it's nothing more than an argument, and I'd caution against using it in lieu (or worse, **against**) of actual evidence.",1523451828

"I side with bigger blocks in this debate. I'm just trying to see from both sides. 

In 100 years when there are no hardware limitations, when there is so much bandwith and memory available that it is no longer a bottleneck, when 100s of transactions a day for every human on earth are no problem; which bitcoin implementation will be better? Purely main chain (large blocks) or main(small blocks)+sidechains?

The large blocks will do everything sidechains can do with the added benefit of main chain security. It will be cheaper, truly peer2peer rather than routing through central hubs, and thus more decentralized and ultimately what matters most - censorship resistant. Without hardware limitations larger blocks are an objectively better way to scale with adoption than side chains. 

So in this way lightning itself is a temporary solution. As hardware advancements accelerate at a much faster rate than population growth (and thus total # tx needed by the people of the world) in the not distant future lightning will not be needed at all. 

If core cucks were okay with implementing a temporarily necessary scaling solution (lightning) why couldn't we have implemented another temporary solution last year. Why was increasing block size a small amount so contentious? Moving to 4mb blocks would not have restricted who could run a node. Raspberry PIs and home computers would still be easily able to run those nodes. This would have prevented the mempool clogging and actually given us enough time to move forward with the next temporary fix (lightning IF necessary) without devolving into a shitshow and failing spectacularly.",1523451191

And EGS has even proposed such changes himself. **Because I see the voting mechanism and incentive system as more fundamental than the *current implementation* of Bitcoin, he basically proved himself wrong**: Selfish mining will *never* be profitable assuming the incentive system underlying Bitcoin works out.

Because HP majority will go ""where the money is.""

second, i agree with you on the gold example and i actually used that myself yesterday in some other unrelated argument i had in this sub. 


where i disagree with you is the value of being the first in. Now first mover advantage does exist, and in an open market like we have name recognition and trust is hugely important. however...as more and more specialized coins gain traction we will see btc dominance dissipate. 


early technologies can only be upgraded so much. there is a limit. like the Model-T car, once the most popular in the world and the first mover. you can only upgrade that car so much before eventually it has to be replaced completely. like netscape, and AOL, and countless other early internet companies, they can only be improved to a point before they will inevitably be replaced.

You will also find in extreme cases should you want to escape a warzone, carrying large quantities of cash around is not ideal, governments are also more likely than not to suspend and monitor large transactions and movements of money.

My point is BCH has no advantage over Bitcoin whatsoever, because after all if it comes to a point when the blocksize needs to be increased we will do it.

So no matter the outcome, BCH is just a copycat with a boring solution that BTC could implement whenever it pleases, with less developers, less interesting projects, no access to Lightning, and more centralised.

Now added to this is of course that some miners will mine at a loss because they have to get some cash now to pay off hardware and the like. Other mining outfits might have deep pockets and are calculating on future returns.

If a significant portion of the miners were to turn their rigs of at once bitcoin could face serious issues as we need a certain number of blocks before the system can rebalance and if no blocks are found because the difficulty is to high it could lead to the death of bitcoin.

"My theory for the BTC sideways movement of the last two weeks:

Obviously a lot of people (traders, recent buyers, and old hodlers), think the BTC price is going lower and want to sell. They have pushed it downward after every recent climb (on Apr 3 and Apr 9).

However, the greater force is the new whales that have been eying BTC since it's newsworthy growth last year. It is common sense to say that anyone looking to start investing in BTC for the first time and who has done their risk/reward research has picked a price point at which to buy in. This includes all the new crypto hedge funds. What is unknown is how much new money is coming in and at what price they are looking to buy BTC.

I had previously thought that 1/4 of the ATH price at 5k USD would be the largest support line of new money coming in. But, it's looking like 1/3 of the ATH is more likely, at 6.5k USD. 

To me, these previous two weeks of support at 6.5K USD suggests that 1/3 of the ATH is the magic support number at which new whales want to buy in. Consider the quick bounce back during the Feb 5 dip. So why 1/3 of ATH? It is similar to previous BTC major corrections, but it's literally just a mental number that stands out in investors' minds: ""BTC will probably fall to one third of its ATH price during this correction,"" is easy to say.

I don't believe in predicting the future, but as a BTC (longterm) trader, I believe in betting on the future. My bet is that there is potential for a BTC 2018 ATL of 5k USD, but I think this recent bouncing off the 6.5K USD line over the last two weeks is the bottom of the 2018 price correction. A slow and steady bull market may follow.

BTC fees are extremely low right now and Lightning Network is taking hold so the performance and fee arguments don't really hold up. While this is a highly politicized topic, there are a few things that seem undeniable. Any meaningful innovation, mindshare and development comes from BTC/Bitcoin/Bitcoin Core. Bcash is basically any other altcoin with no real team or innovation to speak of. They forked Bitcoin and tweaked a few things, mostly for marketing effect and purposfully seed division in the greater community. The arguments made by BCash about block size, segwit, LN etc. are usually short lived, trivial and serve only to wrest control of the ""brand"" Bitcoin from Bitcoin Core and the incumbent team. This is presumably to line the pockets of people like Roger Ver, Jihan, CSW etc. Aside from Jihan's contribution to (large scale/centralized/ASIC) mining they have all essentially proven themselves to be Charlatans of one type or another. From Ver (alledgedly) paying a shill/troll army and attempting to manipulate the market in various ways, as well as misleading people by selling BCash as the ""real bitcoin"" to CSW literally claiming to be Satoshi(not shitting you) it's a pretty grim scene. You can see the factions at work in the r/bitcoin(pro core) and r/btc(pro cash) subreddits. This is just my personal view but I think it's clear that the Bcash crew purposefully creates confusion so new people mistake it for Bitcoin. They vehemently FUD Bitcoin Core, to whom they owe the entirety of their product at the time of the fork. It's just gross IMO.

"BTC is still a currency.  But that is no longer it's primary purpose.  As such, it's use as a currency, will dwindle much like gold did.

&gt;LN is being built to afford its better use as currency. 

That is true.  But it's a third party solution.  It's not part of Bitcoin Core.  The Core developers seem to have lost interest in the currency aspect of Bitcoin.  I hope Lightning succeeds and does well.  Because if it fails, it will drag all of crypto down with it.

We need to get to a point where one crypto does not affect the price significantly of other cryptos.  I like the on-chain scaling of Bitcoin Cash better than second (and now discussions of third) layer solutions.

I think Core should be free to do what they want.  The only problem with that is that the success of BTC directly impacts every other crypto right now.  So, if Lightning fails, I fully expect all cryptos to tank along with BTC.  And I personally believe that Lightning will fail.

Why open yourself to an additional possible mishap when bitcoin already has too many as it is? There's a reason people are only very slowly moving to Segwit and most never will. If you want to use bitcoin as a store of value as you say you do, you don't need a Segwit address because you will hardly ever be moving the balance. As well if miners for some reason decided to stop enforcing Segwit, all Segwit addresses would become anyone can spend. Very small chance and will likely never happen but why risk it?

No. On the contrary, crypto mining will help **solve** the problem we have to switch to green energy. Green energy is usually intermittent, and electricity storage is very expensive/inefficient.

"Technical analysis indicator have their place, but so does data external to the charts. What with google, Facebook, and twitter banning advertising, it’s hard to achieve enough public recognition to attract buyers (demand). The market becomes self contained, and prices go sideways. Big banks control the narrative while they develop their own blockchains. Corporations control the media, which largely controls the narrative. 

So cryptos have to “break out of this prison.” How? By innovating. Bitcoin needs to become a currency and it will with the lightning network. Other coins are getting their own lightning networks, like omisego and stellar and Neo with trinity. Currencies will concentrate on use cases like gaming, too. 

As some point, the public narrative will become impossible for the media to contain...it will turn positive again...but crypto reality has to catch up to the fantasy that fueled the big bull of early 2017",1523443819

And the real growth will happen when global financial crisis hits. As you can see on the news, you can already notice media playing drums for the upcoming crisis. Experts anticipate it to hit hard in 2019-2020. It will be much worse than 2008 since central banks and governments didn't solve any fundamental problems but instead kicked the can down the road through quantitative easing and bail outs. BCH will thrive in those times of uncertainty when banks go bust. BCH will replace banks.",1523443273

"I'm not saying you're wrong, but my experience browsing btc isn't the same as what you describe. I've seen honest and genuine questions downvoted to oblivion simply because they were about bitcoin. In my experience, r/cryptocurrency has much more open discussion about bitcoin than r.bitcoin or r.btc, despite it still being a multi-sided discussion.  

The thing is, there is a large population of great people on both sides of bitcoin debate, but they are drowned out by the loud and obnoxious discussion of the noobs, trolls, shills, and people that don't quite understand the debate. The people who have been in the game for a long time stay relatively quiet, from what I've noticed in recent times compared to the past of crypto subreddits. I'm for crypto of all kinds though.

"&gt; 's useful as a discussion topic, but is not adequate to base decisions on.

I was unaware decisions had been made based on the paper.

&gt; that leaves out the entire point 

Here's the thing, though: you're sayinh the proposed model might not be enough to get the full picture. That's fine, and I even agree. But saying that should **not** be equated (and that's what /u/cryptorebel is doing with his little campaign) to actual evidence that contradicts that model.

A vulnerability has been found in the bitcoin mining process (a pretty minor vulnerability IMO, but a vulnerability nonetheless), and that guy, and to a lesser extent, you, with these comments, are not simply proposing caution and that we should gather more data; you're saying (if you allow me the liberty of taking your position to its logical conclusions) ""hey guys, we can simply never simulate this accurately, but my gut says a miner would never do this, so let's just ignore this vulnerability forever"".

That's a fundamentally unscientific position to take, and it's woefully inadequate for a financial system. If you (or him) want to rebute Sirer's model, then go and build a better one, and add something truly scientifically useful to the discussion.

It blows my mind that right after overcoming BS' takeover of bitcoin by these same tactics, we're right back to ignoring evidence and using ""common sense"" arguments to debate complex topics.

"&gt; It means some of the previous transactions that used to be separate are now batched

The only way for transactions to be batched, is to have one transaction to many. Yes, it's true that batching transactions reduced the number of confirmed transactions on-chain. But it also proves that the majority of transactions are outgoing transactions. Maybe people hoarding or bots arbitraging. Take your pick.

If Bitcoin usage as a currency was growing, you would see the number of transactions of chain also growing, because bitcoin users would be making transactions of 1-to-1, not 1-to-many at the same time, like trading platforms do.

&gt; Also, all cryptos are down in transactions because we're in a valley of interest currently. It's not a Bitcoin specific trend.

The question then arises that it should be decentralized. Yes initially Ripple owns most of the nodes,But! those nodes can be replaced by your own validators. So that means anyone can replace the ripple nodes by nodes they want. These nodes will verify transactions by consensus.

"AI is overhyped bullshit. This tech is nowhere near the level reddit (and especially r/futurology) makes it look like. Yeah, we have seen a few impressive projects in basic logic and planning and many advances in computer vision since tensorflow and other projects became easier to use and aws gpu instances cheaper and more available, but overall AI still doesn't actually exist. What we see is that machine learning is booming, there are of course some advances in algorithms, but in general it's booming because there now so much data available.

So here's the thing, algorithms can be fought by other algorithms, it's literally how the stockmarkets function today. And it's already happening in crypto too, for example there's a trading bot that bets on the cryptos with the most 'hodl' activity but you could also easily measure social volume in other ways. The interesting thing about crypto is that there can always be a new market. What if you put your 'ai' / bot / ml algorithm in a dapp and what if you open it up, so that others can directly invest in your dapp? If your successful, others will follow and write new prediction dapps. Now you have a (prediction) market. Now what if you then create a bot that analyzes prediction dapps to predict if they will be successful. Now you have a predictions prediction market. You know where this is going, it's predictions all the way down. The real stock market will not be able to compete with the speed of innovation in this space, I'd say there a chance that one day dapps and interlinked cryptos will simply buy the stock market.

"Bill is a smart guy, and he made some good points. Japan's blessing probably did have an impact, and he's right about the impact of the general lack-of-sellers in the Bitcoin community.

However, I would argue that a *much* bigger factor was **the halvening**. If the market were perfectly rational this would not be expected to have a large effect, **but it's not**, not yet at least. I was among the cadre of folks who was arguing (on a daily basis) that the halvening would have a huge positive impact on the price *in the year or two following its actual occurrence*, based on a few (of what I consider to be fundamentally sound) arguments and the empirical evidence we have regarding the first halvening in 2012 (and the double-bubble of 2013 that followed). It's essentially a supply crunch (or to be more accurate, an *inflation crunch*) that is only truly taken into account once the ball starts rolling, rather than in advance (as the EMH might tempt you to expect).

The halvening was huge, not on ""the day of"" but in the months that followed, as everyone's coins got that much more precious, relatively speaking.

I'm not going to lie, it's a bit frustrating to see my arguments and predictions (often made years in advance) continually validated, without the rest of the community ""waking up"" to that fact. Some of us have been on-the-dot, explaining what is coming and our reasoning on why exactly we expect it to be so, while newcomers (and old-time naysayers alike) keep dismissing what we say, by and large.

Called the bubble in 2013, called the reason it would pop, called the bubble in 2017, called the pop, and still getting ignored or mocked to this day. Weird feeling. Oh well!",1523440568

However, if the BCH price suddenly rose hugely - more than tenfold - (eg way above 1.0) *during a BTC difficulty period*, BCH could *theoretically* take all of the hashpower until the next BTC difficulty adjustment (which would never happen...). However, even during EDA madness around 30% of miners stayed with BTC even though it was less profitable to do so. Arguably, enough miners would always stay with BTC to get through to the next DA which would reduce BTC difficulty and get it back to ~6 blocks an hour.

Chain death spiral is extremely unlikely. The posts about it last August were uninformed at best.",1523439971

i don't understand why lightning wasn't simply done in parallel with changing the blocksize and allowing bitcoin to chooch along as it had been.  it's current state has been crappy for adoption, and news articles have gone from new merchants accepting it to simply being about it's price, attracting FOMO bubble speculators and not what a currency needs - people who actually transact in it.

"if the original white paper said it was a store of value, and used for payments some time later, what economic reason would anyone have ever had to actually purchase or value any?

has there ever been a time in history where this is even the case - store of value 'first'?  almost all traditional money has had some kind of intrinsic value - which bitcoin simply does not.  and in most societies what is money was declared by those in power, ie. the government/king, so wealth could be transferred as well as extracted from the populous via taxation.

i can't watch the video at the moment but i'll try and do it later, as i am interested in his comments on that and haven't seen them clearly before.

i do not consider holding bitcoin using it.  if i worked for USD and took it all home and burned it in my backyard on a hot summer day for the rest of my life, how would i have used USD for anything?  it wouldn't have even been used for heat.

&gt; I'm not a programmer, developer, etc. I believe Bitcoin can be the catalyst for a lot of positive change in the world in the coming years, and right now the only way I can help Bitcoin is by holding it and trusting it as a store of value.

this is interesting in that for people on the lower end of the income scale, the fees alone for BTC price them out, if we are still talking BTC vs. BCH.  nonetheless, why would holding it be the catalyst for change?  the possibility is that it does something like bring banking to unbanked people.  they do need a store of value but they need it as a stable one, which in the case of a currency, comes in the form of something actually used.  bitcoin isn't helped by holding it and trusting it as a store of value; if everyone did that it would be super volatile and 100% speculative.

look at the USD - people trade it on forex all the time.  but they are trading based on pips - tiny movements in the currency.  because it is so large and used in so many transactions.  it's quite stable, the real organic demand for it is quite high, the speculative value is this small percentage of tiny movements.

simply having more people or higher prices doesn't mean something is stable - we had more people in housing and higher prices than ever across the US - up until 2006 when shit started hitting the fan.  neither indicate stability or floating around a proper equilibrium value.

let's say germany left the EU and restarted the deutschmark - required to be used to pay taxes and settle debts there now.  it would be a new currency and much more volatile than the US - however it would also have a significant amount of real transactions and real demand.  by government force, certainly, nonetheless it would have real demand.  it would have greater speculation and volatility than USD but still a good deal more stable than BTC or any crypto.

crypto purely as a currency (so not things like ETH) is just like a new country coming out and issuing a new currency.  although in this case there is no force, no government that creates a base of relatively stable real demand.  it's just people who choose to use it or not.  but if they just ""buy"" it to ""invest"" in it, they are just speculative HODLers.  they are like the guys trading currencies on forex, although a much less sophisticated version of it.  if *everyone* did this, the currency wouldn't be great and trustworthy as a store of value - it would be a super volatile gamble.  and as 'new gold' this is *absolutely not* how 'old' gold got into and played a role in the historic or current monetary system.  note the forex traders also are buying AND SELLING currency constantly as well - they are not HODLers, so even their speculation contributes much more to the stability of forex traded currencies.

BTC, or any crypto, will only lose volatility and gain stability as the majority of participants goes from speculative HODLers to people who actually transact and use it *as money* - and *as money* one of its features is that it will be a store of value.

currently however, it looks like we've been trending away from this.  FOMO has attracted new speculators, with many of the people before them, and certainly the new speculators, being primarily interested in just that.  HODL until lambo.  lambo never comes unless HODLers escape at the right time of a speculative bubble, or unless actual organic real use of crypto results in its value actually rising to a lambo level.  which it doesn't by my nail salon friend buying some, or my car buddy buying some looking at it as a lotto ticket.

merchants are often on slim profit margins as is - of course they are going to escape the volatility and risk of crypto into fiat if they can't trust crypto to be more stable.  my nail salon HODL friend is not going to help that goal at all though, she's just a speculator contributing to the volatility.  these players thus harm merchant adoption.",1523437312

https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/41e4he/1_year_ago_blockstream_ama_where_they_say_how/


Here's a thought experiment for you.

If you truly think Blockstream, run by some of the most old school of cypherpunks, have been simply corrupted against all their values by a bit of money (which they don't even need because they are all fucking minted because, you know, bitcoin) then you might look around to see who the most credible, incorruptible and independent person in the space is and see what they think.

He actually went to Syria and picked up an AK47 and fought ISIS along side the Kurds for the anarchist movement he believes in.

bitcoin is deflationary, which is fine in small amounts, but not good in large amounts, because it doesn't result in anyone transacting.  ie. i think it's more analogous to compare bitcoin to the deflationary spiral of the depression, in my view, than to say gresham's law applies to it.",1523436077

Why would they? Bcash isn't a threat to bitcoin, although the delusional people in rbtc would have you believe so. And Slush seems like a pretty nice guy, so doubt he'd be interested even. Hell, it might not even be legal to do it.

&gt; I think you thinking too easy.

It is exactly that easy. Open a mining pool, publish your node with a little info about not relaying tx's, and there you have it. Its a wide open gaping security hole.

&gt; Monero has 0conf as well.

I don't know how it works there, but that doesnt matter here.

&gt; because when you send your double spend to a specific node which was excluded, which ""supported double spends"".

This proposition is the absolutely worst idea that has ever been touted in rbtc and shows a complete lack of understanding of why the system works, and what it means to be ""censorship resistant"".

"&gt; Does bitcoin core function as smoothly?

At the moment, fees on BTC are relatively low, but this can change rapidly, as we saw in December 2017, with fees up to $30 or more on average.

Bitcoin Cash strives to keep enough capacity so that required fees to get confirmed can remain consistently low.

People who send only from exchange to exchange and don't hold Bitcoin (Core or Cash) on their own wallets are likely to suffer when exchanges get hacked or shut down etc.

This is why I encourage people who get tipped in this thread to withdraw some or all of the BCH into a wallet of their own.

If you use the chaintip bot, all tips come out of your own wallet and are not stored on a central server (except for relay).",1523433652
"By selling them in the future. The mechanics behind it is this: Bitcoin’s current value is $7k. You promise to sell me 1 bitcoin in a week’s time for $7k. Thing is, you don’t actually own any bitcoin at the moment. 

One week later you buy a bitcoin, and you sell it to me for $7k as promised. Let’s look at two scenarios one week after we formed our agreement.

1) the bitcoin price is $6k. You buy one and instantly sell it to me for $7k. You’ve just made $1k.

2) the bitcoin price is $8k. You buy one and instantly sell it to me for $7k. You’ve just lost $1k.

The effect is the same as if you had held negative 1 bitcoin from day 0 and sold it on day 7.

The risky thing with selling futures is that there’s no limit to how much you can lose. You know how people say “only invest what you can afford to lose”, you can’t do that if you short. If in a week’s time bitcoin’s price is $20k, you lose $13k. If the price is $100k you lose $93k. If you don’t have the money you declare yourself bankrupt. 

As a completely independent person with nothing at stake, I would advise against shorting such a volatile asset.",1523433621

If you think it matters that Ethereum itself wasn't compromised, you don't understand market psychology (or average people, for that matter).

"Hey man how re you doing now a few months later?

I've been struggling with similar issues. I got into crypto in January as all my friends had been doing so well in 2017. I honestly just thought I'd put a few thousand in to start. One thing led to another and I managed to put much much more. Once the link from my bank to gdax was open it just felt too easy. I was blinded by Fomo. It was when it dipped to 15k after 20k and I thought it was just a correction before the next leg up.

I was in a dark place emotionally as I'd been struggling with a chronic condition which makes me barely able to talk without a lot of pain. I felt lower than I had in years and somehow crypto gave me a little spark again, the excitement and illusion of making some money. I have been unable to work and I thought it would help fund treatment for my throat.

Basically I want desperate and I made some terrible decisions. I have always been very sensible and conservative with money. This was completely out of character.

I knew almost nothing about the whole market, trading, chart, strategies etc. 

Then it crashed pretty hard after I got myast deposit in. I freaked out and wanted to sell but everyone online and my friends just said hodl! I wish I hadn't listened. We went all the way to 6k, 70% down from where I'd bought. 

It was devastating as i felt I'd thrown away all my savings. I thought it was money I could handle losing but I was wrong. I was ready for a 20 or 30% crash but not this. 

At this point I began obsessively researching, probably 8 to 10 hours a day. The coins, the exchanges, sending it all around, making trades, technical analysis, fundamentals. I diversified in to various alt coins, I read all the white papers. I was watching so many YouTube videos every day.

I believed like many that 6k was the bottom and it started rising again. I felt more at ease as we made our way up. I thought it would just be a short crash like many in the past. There was so much bad news at that point I thought it would blow over.

At this point I decided to scrape together the last of my money, which j actually needed, and put it in to lower my cost average. But I didn't get it at the 6k bottom, in fact I didn't feel comfortable with the reversal until we were back at 10k, so I put the rest in there.

Blinded by it going up, I then couldn't even consider selling even when it got close enough that I only would have lost a few thousand from my original investment. I'd made a vow to take out 10k when it got back to my buy price as I knew I'd put too much in. But it only got to 11.5k. I wish I'd sold there.

Then it just kept falling and I kept trying to find a place to sell, and I did sell a large portion of my stack but as soon as it came back close to my sell point I'd buy in because I feared it would.rise more. People talk about selling as if it's easy, but selling to buy lower is incredibly hard as you always feel it will reverse after and it may well do.

I eventually realised that all my alts were dying in BTC value but it was a bit late. BTc dominance was rising, and I decided to sell all my alts for BTC. This turned out to be the bottom, or so I thought. Icon went up 100% the day after I sold. I was devastated as this was my biggest alt holding. Neo and omg also went up. I fomoed back in to them at 12% higher than I sold and of course then they came down to below where idols again.

I had spent months learning about ta and practising trades. But when it came to it I often sold and BTC went lower but I didn't take the 5 or 10% profit as I worried it would go lower and wanted to wait for the bottom. It always came back up and I bought in only for it to go back down. I really couldn't believe how I as getting it so wrong.

So here we are. The price is very low, I've lost about 14k GBP. I've been incredibly obsessed,   always thinking about crypto, not sleeping well. I feel deep regret over my decisions. Especially as in 2016 I met a guy who was offering to teach people how to invest in crypto, and I put my name up, but my throat as so bad I couldn't talk and it took over at that point. If I'd even put in 2k at that point I'd be doing fine now with no stress at all. If I'd put in what I have put in now in 2016 I'd have hundreds of thousands and still none of the stress.  

So missing out on that opportunity and the. Fomoing in at the worst time because I was in such a bad place has let me with deep regret. I know it's silly to regret too much, and learn and move on. But my mind really latches on to these things and just feels like it's all I can think about and I get a sinking feeling in my stomach all the time.

I lost a lot in BTC value in the way down because of my bad trades. I still haven't made one profitable trade! And I haven't seen any profit on my investment. I forgot to when it started recovering before it crashed again I got involved in ICOs. I invested quite a chunk of my money in them and then when the market crashed many of them came out far below ico price. So that wasn't easy either!

I do believe crypto will thrive at some point, but what's most painful now is that I could have had 3 or 4 times as much if I'd just been a week later. My timing really couldn't have been worse. I did dollar cost average, but only over a few weeks and that wasn't enough for the amount of money I put in.

I wonder if I'll always regret it, even when hopefully I'm up on my original investment. Knowing a slight timing difference could have made everything so different. But that's probably my obsessive mind trying to torture me.

I've tried to be as sensible as I can recently, I haven't been chasing my loss with bigger trades. I put everything back on my ledger but about 10% which I allowed myself to learn to trade with. I only hold a few solid coins, BTC, omg, neo. 

If I could go back in time with what I know now it's so obvious how I would do things differently. But what if it had confused after invested up to 30k or 40k? I wouldn't be saying that, I'd think I was a genius....until the next crash.

So I'm trying to see this as a learning experience. Partly as it forced me to learn much more than I would have if it had continued a bull run. But also an emotional lesson. I have learned a lot about myself, even if it's still painful I learned about my obsession, my greed and fear. I realise how money just for money's sake can be a very negative force for me. I don't want a Lamborghini or anything expensive, I just any time and freedom. That's what money would allow. But I've seen so many people in the crypto scene just hell bent on getting g rich so they can buy and do superficial things, it's been quite off putting. I saw this part of myself, the part that wants more more more.

I also realised envy is a huge part of it. It wasn't greed as much as envying others. I realise that if the whole market died and went to zero I think I'd feel fine. But if I lost all my money trading of feel terrible. I guess it's the feeling of being in the same boat rather than desperately paddling behind people in their big boats miles ahead of you.

I've learned that my risk tolerance is not nearly as high as I thought it was, and that I don't need more stress in my life. I used to meditate a lot and spend so much time outside enjoying nature. I feel crypto has led me so far away from all of that. It is like an addiction of sorts.

I hope to find some time soon to write up a really comprehensive story and some warnings for new comers. I think it will help me and them hopefully.

I know you read all the time the rules, like don't invest more than you can afford to lose. But you don't read that many stories like this OPs with epilepsy being really honest about their mistakes. And that's what I appreciate.

Thanks for listening, and hopefully this bear market will end soon and give us some relief ;)",1523431774

"I've barely been able to follow crypto the last three months — I've been swamped with finishing my education, working, and working on a TV pilot with a friend. It has meant writing cryptocurrency articles has slowed down a bit, which was a fun side gig I hope to revive soon. That said, I don't miss being glued to the charts like I was in November to Jan. I guess there was just a lot more free time as the year was winding down. ",1523431555

"As I said, I agree the paper is incomplete. But you can't blame the paper, because throwing in too many things can obscure the argument.

For the SM strategy it doesn't matter, if you want to analyse the strategy. Imagine if I want to analyse a game of craps mathematically, and I need to put in my model the fact that the other guy might be bigger than me and crush my head if he loses.

What I dislike about the paper are the conclusions: ""bitcoin is broken, needs to amend the protocol, etc"".",1523431357

"There's an Android Wallet called Eclair that should be launching on the Play Store soon (it was there but got removed by the devs).

Note that if your BTC is on Coinbase, it's not under your control, it's under Coinbases. If it's a significant amount of money, consider getting a hardware wallet. At least research some Mobile wallets.

Here the steps for Lightning:

**WARNING: Lightning is still in Beta so there could be bugs. This is not easy for beginners. Use small amounts of money that you don't mind losing!**

1. Download Eclair (when it comes back) or another Lightning wallet (like Zap)

2. Create or restore a wallet in Eclair

3. Send money to your Eclair wallet (it's now ready to use as Bitcoin wallet)

4. Go to channels and open a Payment Channel. Eclair allows you to open a channel with one of their Nodes. You can also open a Lightning node with someone else.

5. Wait for the other party to confirm the channel. Congrats, you are now on the Lightning Network

"Sure.

Google trends track the frequency of google searches. So the graph is showing how often people, presumably that are unfamiliar with bitcoin, are trying to learn how to buy.

Since bitcoin still has a ways to go before being ""grandma ready"" in terms of ease-of-use, the lack of searches illustrates a lack of new money coming in.

This is bad for bitcoin.",1523430313
"&gt; Attacking Roger Ver hasn’t worked

&gt; Attacking Jihan hasn’t worked

&gt; Bcash spam hasn’t worked

&gt; CSW is the current weak link in the chain for reddit and twitter concern trolling

This is exactly what the OP is talking about. CSW isn’t being attacked because he’s the “current weak link” in BCH. He’s being attacked by members of the BCH community, because he is a massive fraud who should never have had any credibility in the BCH community in the first place.

In a sane and rational world the shit Craig tried to pull with “the Satoshi affair” (as people so politely germ it) would have resulted in him being shunned by any and every crypto project in the world. 

But when there is money involved people tend to get a little irrational, and a bit morally flexibile, and suddenly the guy who tried to manufacture proof that he invented Bitcoin is CSO at a crypto company and speaking at conferences alongside other *legitimate* scientists and developers.",1523430180

Hey at least you are taking it a lot better than the majority. Many would never re-enter the crypto market again after they get scammed and just take their losses but you've accepted that you got scammed and you want to fix it by trading from it back. We need more optimistic people like you in the community. I'm sure it'll be a great story :),1523430132
"Let's hope not.  Assuming that house cost $100,000 that would mean 1 Sat = $1.  So the smallest amount you can ever transfer is then $1, how utterly useless would that be as a currency.  Remember large parts of the world live on a few dollars a day.
There is a fundamental problem with Bitcoin that SegWit LN and all the rest can't solve, 21,000,000 isn't enough to go around.",1523430115

Yes, it looks important.",1523430047
