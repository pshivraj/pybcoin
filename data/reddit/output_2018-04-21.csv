"Coinbase is insured like a normal bank. Crypto kids don't like it because it's too ""mainstream,"" as in it's actually setup like a bank and is federally insured. This means that if they are hacked and they're bankrupted, your investment is guaranteed by the feds up to $250K, iirc. That amount of security comes from working with ""the establishment,"" therefor the anti-establishment, conspiratorial crowd hates it mostly because it comes with it a certain level of accountability that is antithetical to the decentralized anonymize nature of crypto.. As in, it makes money laundering and subversion more difficult and government surveillance easier. But that is all beside the fact that Coinbase is by far the safest exchange you can keep your investment and is arguably safer than a hardware wallet if you don't know what you're doing (which is 90+% of people invested in bitcoin). As a normal person who hans't drank the extreme techno-libertarian cool-aid and just wants to try their hand, coinbase/gdax is where you should keep your investment and do your trading.",1524380395

I've detected lots of *missing* code in Lightning Network.

* Code on Eclair wallet to actually find routes rather than use centralised server to do it

"This is one of the messages I got back in the day, I was already invested in ethereum though :D

&gt; Hello, I would like to apologize to you. I did not think my messages were very bad, but the overwhelmingly negative reaction surprised me. Thats why I want to say I am sorry and give you a bit of explanation.

&gt; The reason I started sending these messages is mainly because I believe in Ethereum long term. For a long time I tried discussing with people on ways to improve bitcoin, but anything that doubts the status quo is immidiately downvoted or censored.

&gt; When I found out about Ethereum I was amazed that most of the ideas I though of before were actually already implemented in it. So I wondered why I never read about it in the common information channels.

&gt; Then I realized, the censorship in /r/bitcoin is much more deep-rooted than just theymos, it is actually most of the community. So many of the participants really want the value of bitcoin to go up and get rich quick that they are incentiviced to downvote anyone who doubts the current decisions of the status quo.

&gt; Then I realized I can easily by-pass the censorship by sending private messages, there is nothing the status quo can do about that. All I want to do it try to inspire people like me to find the information they need to make a rational informed decision.

The same people who abandoned Bitcoin when the price went from $1k to $200 only got involved when the price was at $1k, and they're the same people who get burned time and again in every absurd bull market (they generally return and probably lost money in the last $20k bull run too).

It needs centralized controllers to force wealth inequality, Banks and Governments. Go read your history the Bretton Woods system. Almost all institutions are now corrupted and not serving the people Governments and banks executing posterity is the proof.

the Leftists are as corrupt as the right  they are both resist neocons. Listen to progressives and traditional conservatives, and ignore decisive extremist and rationals to go to war and kill people.

"DGB for long term hold. No it’s not a pump and dump. No we were never associated with McAfee. We didn’t tell him to do that. 

DGB is based on UTXO, has 15 second block times and transactional speeds which double every year up to 280,000 per second. Fees are pretty much $0.0000001 per transaction. 5 mining algorithms + 200,000 running nodes = extremely decentralized. Recently spoke at Harvard and MIT and had private business meetings there as well. Everyone likes to poke fun at DigiByte which is okay. We’re like rank 55. But I believe we are far undervalued considering our scalability and proven technology started in 2014 NOT as an ICO. 

We’re open source. Price is around 3 cents. 1/1000 BTC/DGB ratio means theoretically in peak markets based off of bitcoin supply and demand we could be $8+. Yes LTC is undervalued too....but not as much as DGB especially considering scalability issues. 

Just hope you at least look at DigiByte.io website for yourself man. Invest in whatever you want. I prefer to invest in projects with more growth potential for their proven application, rather than in top 10 coins. Just me. Top 10 are safer sure.

Yes, miners will get paid through fees - there is no other mechanism.

Correct. LN doesn't remove them because BTC will continue to exist.  But LN does eat into the fees.  If you and I open a channel and do 1000 transactions per day, the miners don't see a penny of that.  Miners will get paid when either one of us opens/closes...and thats my point.  
You will pay the piper one way or another.  Because miners need X millions of dollars a day to run POW.  LN cannot reduce fees without reducing POW.  The people who continue doing onchain will pay a hefty price to keep POW paid for.  And those people will include LN users as well.",1524372578

"The US dollar is the world's reserve currency and its value has been lost over the years as well. Bitcoins value increased dramatically because it was in high demand. If the world was going to have a ""universal"" currency, a great feature for it to have is for its value to increase as more people use it. However, the value of bitcoin is not because of its demand, the value is in the computing power and energy used to create it. In a way the value of that physical energy is transferred directly into the network. ",1524369197
"It was sarcasm to point out the cheapness of “internet of things”. Not everything needs or should be connected. I have already argued with plenty of IOTA fanboys.

"Well, countries and states certainly can try \- many of them are trying.  I think their efforts will not be incredibly effective.  What their regulatory efforts mean depends on what the regulation or law is.  

The real problem with this approach \(that some U.S. states and some countries are taking\) is that if we were to agree with their approach, people will be sent to jail for not having a license or not transmitting data within permissions of a state or country.  People can use dollars without a license, and people can write code and share it all over the world without a license.  Using bitcoin is no different whether or not you are writing code for it.  Using bitcoin is an expressive activity.

"Sure. Money has some fundamental properties: immutability, portability, the ability to be transferred, and fungibility. Gold, for example, is immutable and fungible - every chunk of gold is exactly the same as every other, and once it’s spent, you can’t go and spend the same gold elsewhere. But it’s not very portable. Similarly, fiat is portable, easy to transfer, somewhat fungible (marked bills), but it’s not immutable - the central bank can print more, or your bank can reverse your spending. 

Bitcoin has been so successful because it’s portable, easy to transfer, AND immutable. But it’s not truly fungible, due to the transparent Blockchain. Monero arguably is a better bitcoin than bitcoin because it is TRULY fungible, in addition to having the other properties as well. Every Monero is indistinguishable from every other. ",1524368593

Rather, they've created some kind of regulatory ""box"" in which bitcoin exchanges can operate.

"I do wonder how the miners will get paid though.  No matter how you slice it, BTC's POW is directly proportional to electricity that miners use and miners have electricity bills at end of month.  For BTC to have higher POW than BCH it needs to pay miners more.  Once the reward dries up, its the fees that will carry the burden.  On a 4MB block (assuming 100% segwit utilization), you are looking at $100 for a 300 byte transaction (assuming BTC uses 2Million a day on electricity).  So if I need to fill up my LN channel, that's a $200 (to close and open).

A system that cannot be censored in any way, a system that costs a non zero amount to use, such that trolls gotta pay if they want to troll, and brigading posts becomes much more expensive.

However, there are mixtures of up/down movements within a given snapshot of time.  As such, you are hedging your losses by diversifying your porfolio.  Moreover, if you make profit on one coin, you can transfer some of these gains to another coin in your portfolio that is due to go up.  Now my subjective opinion is that in crypto, there is such a thing as a coin due to go up if it hasn't gone up in a while (especially in a bull market).  I suspect this stems from enough people believing in ""something is due to go up"" and as such, it becomes realized in practice.

Now I understand even less...  Consider the example again.  How can Alice know that the box that signed T1 was out of sync when it signed it?

It is rather pointless to discuss the proposal if it is not complete.  All the ingredients of Satoshi's bitcoin had been known for years, or decades: cryptographic signatures, Merkle links, proof of work, majority consensus, etc.  What made the protocol (apparently) work was the combination of them all.  

You are aware that very precise synchonized clocks are old technology, right?  You can buy units that combine a precise internal clock (possibly atomic) with satellite or radio feed of the UTC or ATI date-time, with all corrections and checks for light speed etc.  

Even without special hardware, there is a standard protocol (Network Time Protocol, NTP) that can synchronize the internal clocks of computers in a network, compensating for chock speed errors and internet propagation delays.

Satoshi did not assume NTP, perhaps because he wanted to minimize the hardware/software/network requirements to use the protocol.  Therefore he allowed large errors in the block timestamps (including out-of-order timestamps), but used them only to compute the block rate over a 2-week interval. 

So I don't understand what those black boxes would contribute besides a set of synchronized clocks...",1524364678

If you're looking for something new, then I suggest GET Protocol

Why? Because it uses blockchain to solve a real problem in a novel way. I suggest reading [this](https://www.np.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/8d6edp/why_i_consider_get_protocol_to_be_a_good_long/) for a very brief and well written overview, but if you want a more thorough understanding of the project itself, I suggest giving their [site](https://guts.tickets/) and their [2-pager](https://guts.tickets/files/two-pager-GET-Protocol-latest.pdf) a quick look.   

If you don't like reading and you just want to be shilled, then this project has:  
  
- A low marketcap ($7 million as of this post)  
- A low Circulating and Total Supply (10,384,393, and 33,368,773 respectively)  
- A working product since 2016 solving a real problem (ticket scalping/price gouging)  
- A token with an actual purpose (Their service requires GET to function. GET is required for Event Organizer's and Artists' to use the platform. They also buy back GET from the open market).  
- More exchange listings planned for Q2  
- Staking coming Q3  
- Users don't require ANY knowledge of blockchain in order to use the service. You just need a phone number. That's it.  (Mainstream adoption anyone?)  
  
It's also really cheap right now (close to ICO price).

And by the way, this is just my opinion, but remember how no one even heard of Nano until it started being shilled because the coin was initially marketed towards Venezuelans? And once people saw how good it was, Nano skyrocketed, despite being on a crappy exchange? That's how I feel about GET. No one's heard about it in the states because the team are from the Netherlands focusing on their own demographic (for now). And just like Nano, they already have a working product, and they're only listed on crappy, low volume exchanges so far. But that didn't stop anyone from buying Nano. And it *probably* won't stop you. Didn't stop me anyway, lol

Anyways, this is such a good use case for crypto, that I'm honestly surprised at the lack of coverage its gotten so far, but that's how it goes sometimes.  Anyhow, DYOR and form your own opinions before investing in anything.

"It is based on the team forking it. Its not really that simple but its not too complex either. A well known coder in the bitcoin community forks bitcoin and adds a few lines of code (couple of new nothing-features maybe). Starts spreading word about it and meanwhile gathers support from other fellow coders to join hands for increasing popularity. Depending on how popular the fork becomes, they work with exchanges to award a 1:1 for BTC holders.

Now the biggest manipulation of the market happens - without which none of these forks will sustain. When the announced hard fork block is reached, the team will initially pump the price or hold it above certain levels making others believe there is a huge demand for this. Naturally market makers also take over and fomo kicks in. Once a certain price is established, you will always have bag holders shilling to no extent and this cycle keeps going. No real value whatsoever but the team has successfully avoided any initial dumps plus team itself should not sell a major portion of their pre-mined coins immediately.

I know I might be missing a lot of finer details here, but the gist is really that simple. Artificially create demand and let people take over.",1524363776

"I would love for this to be true, of course, ideally for BCH, but here's where I have trouble finding it plausible: assume by 2020 USD M1 is around 4 trillion. For simplicity's sake, let's say BTC/BCH supply in 2020 is 20 million (could be somewhat less taking into account unmined and permanently lost/burned coins), that only works out to about 200,000 USD/coin.

So either BTC or BCH has to have five times the market capitalization it has today to reach that figure, or else the USD has to have undergone hyperinflation (I think a lot of people will be disappointed if 1 bitcoin=1 million dollars, but 1 million dollars buys you a used Civic).

Either such changes require big geopolitical developments beyond just crypto catching on in a big way, so I'm skeptical of them happening based purely on extrapolation of prior trends.

"**Network effect**

A network effect (also called network externality or demand-side economies of scale) is the positive effect described in economics and business that an additional user of a good or service has on the value of that product to others. When a network effect is present, the value of a product or service increases according to the number of others using it.

The classic example is the telephone, where a greater number of users increases the value to each. A positive externality is created when a telephone is purchased without its owner intending to create value for other users, but does so regardless.

"Think of it rationally.

A private ATM is used to withdraw cash using a debit card. Let's call $2.50 the normal fee (free ATMs are only free because it's operated by your bank or a partner paid by your bank). These get many transactions per day, in decent locations like a gas station it will make a dozen or more per day, or about $1000 per month.

A BTM will have about one transaction per day in a similar location. That transaction will be on average $150, which at a real profit of 10% is $15 per day, or $450 per month.

The ATM operator pays the same rent or less (due to the public perception of bitcoin making everyone rich effecting lease deals), and pays a small amount to be part of the network. The cost of hardware for an ATM is usually less, but we'll just assume it's the same since it's a diverse market and you can find models more and less cost either ATM or BTM.

Now, the ATM operator may be a small business or even the store owns it in many cases. They will fill it with cash from their bank and get deposits to their bank account for the transactions. Banks are generally fine with this, no giant leaps.

The BTM operator has had bank accounts closed regularly and often has to buy bitcoin above the ""general market rate"". Bitcoin exchanges like coinbase/gdax and gemini close their accounts as well. Now what? Well, just pay a crazy fee to get banking and send regular international wires :)

So, to operate a BTM at 10% using the normal business model (bank+exchange) you make less than running a small network of traditional ATMs and suffer higher risk. The only advantage is market saturation. Finding good spots for an ATM where one isn't already is hard. BTMs are still quite rare to find anywhere.",1524360459
"&gt;If the goal is to have one \(or more \- look at USD and EUR\) universally accepted decentralized \(anonymous?\) currency/payment system, what makes Bitcoin \(and no other cryptocurrency\) so special? Why would all the millionaires need/want BTC specifically \(which is what needs to happen in order for it to go so high\) instead of any other cryptocurrency who does the same \(or an even better\) job?

This is quite a tricky question to answer.

If you consider only cryptocurrencies that aim to be a payment system and not much more \(ie excluding Ethereum and similar systems for now\), it's arguably quite likely that there will be a single system that remains much larger than the rest, rather than a few similar systems being equally large. Participants will be incentivised to use the largest system, thus growing it even further as new participants enter the scene. 

This is called The Network Effect and is further explained here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network\_effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect)

Bitcoin has this advantage today. The cryptocurrency market is extremely volatile and speculative at this stage, and real\-world adoption hasn't really picked up yet. As the market matures, along with the software implementations of the different cryptocurrencies, we'll at some point start to see real\-world adoption at a faster rate than we see today. I think that when this happens, when merchants start feeling more comfortable accepting cryptocurrencies as payment and when people start feeling comfortable using cryptocurrencies as their primary means of payment, we will witness the theory of the network effect happen. As a merchant accepting cryptocurrencies, you want to accept the currency which most people have. As a consumer, you want to own the currency which most merchants will accept. It remains to be seen how much of the market share this largest system will claim, but I think it's going to be quite a large portion.

From a more technical perspective, it's very hard to argue that there exists another cryptocurrency that's ""better"" than Bitcoin. Bitcoin is an extremely well designed system, all things considered, and it's not easy to keep it that way when you're talking about systems that are open\-source in the same way that Bitcoin is. As of today, Bitcoin is by far the most secure system, due to the sheer amount of computing power expended by miners which secures it. It's the most mature system out there by quite a margin, and if scalability can be eloquently solved it is arguably ready for mainstream adoption at a global scale. As it turns out, a very exciting technology is in works, that is the Lightning Network, and it is my opinion and that of many others that there is great reason to be optimistic about it's development. Unfortunately it is not ready yet, but then again none of the cryptos are \(ready for global adoption\), and none come close to being as close to being ready as Bitcoin is \(arguably\). If the Bitcoin community succeeds in designing an off chain solution that enables higher transaction throughput, while continuing improvements and optimisations \(those are mostly focused on efficiency and privacy right now, as far as I know\) on the base layer \(on chain\), it will be well on it's way towards getting ready for mainstream usage. Fortunately, all those things are being actively worked on today, and are looking very promising. 

But of course it's up to you to do your own research. It's hard to differentiate the good advice from the bad, everyone is incentivised to convince you that ""their"" coin is the best. If your not very technical \(ie a programmer\) then it can be hard to understand what is really going on except at a very high level. If nothing else, then the aforementioned network effect might be a reason for you to consider investing in Bitcoin, and with it's unmatched track record of withstanding attacks/software bugs/anything that could harm the network, it's hard to imagine Bitcoin going away any time soon. It's arguably the safest bet in the cryptocurrency market, and has pretty good chance of making some extremely high returns on investments for those who get in before adoption occurs. Do note though that this is not financial advice, it's only my view of things, and I'll say it again, I encourage anyone to do their own research before investing in this space.",1524360455

My parents are divorced and I thought there was a lot of potential in bitcoin. He ended up buying 7 houses in North Carolina and was renting them out. He basically lives off the money he makes through that and makes about 3000 a month. He bought the houses in a short sale but I calculated it and if he invested in bitcoin it would be worth close to 40 million dollars. I still regret not investing myself. I had saved 2000 dollars over the summer from working and instead of saving or investing I cashed out and bought a computer. I was 13 by the way.",1524358796

"I am not an accountant or anything like that so take this with a grain of salt.  But IMO this is a bad idea.  Because the price changes so quickly, you can be on the hook for a lot of taxes.
  
On day 1 you are give $100 worth of BTC  Three days later you convert it to fiat but in that time, the price goes up and what you have is now worth $150.  When you sell it to get fiat, you will owe tax on that $50.00.
  
Of course the numbers are just examples but this is in essence how it works in the USA.  If the price DROPPED by $50 in that time, you could claim a business loss on the $50 instead.
  
But it is an incredibly risky method of getting paid.  BTW this counts if you sell for fiat, trade for other crypto, or even purchase goods or services with the BTC.

Yes, there are plenty of noise about BTC being the currency of the future, alternative to gold, etc but most of it are just hyperbole to justify the ""value"" of BTC.

Now that I have a wallet with $0.08 in it, I was able to pay a fee of about $0.0024 to put a transaction out there with my name on it, and I can similarly send out permanent messages on this blockchain by spending more fractions of a cent.

And that's not the whole point, that's just one example of the things that are made possible by a network that has seriously put keeping tx fees low as a priority.  Which bitcoin core evidently has not, and many other block chains have not to the same degree as BCH.

I'd say that was a pretty effective $0.08 marketing spent for the BCH network.  Thanks friend!",1524356669

"Haha, yeah that guy who had Satoshis pgp key or somehing?(faketoshi i recall), he also said that Bitcoin Cash will be more and more decentralized versus ""Bitcoin Core"" being less and less decentralized.. 

But what they do not manage too acknowledge is that a decentralized community of developers as well as decision takers is much much important than every aspect of the network being decentralized, as you can put a gun to someones head and make them too a change, but you cant put a gun to a node and say ""Hey i want this and this, here is how you gonna do it: Please fork that chain so you split up their community so i can buy in for less than i have too if i buy in now, ok? Roger that!""

This is something we need to not let happen at any cost, that is why even to i am very sceptical to the nature of lightning network, i support it. Because it still does not change anything of Bitcoin in it self, if you want to use Bitcoin as you always did, you can still do that.. Using LN is a choice.. Same goes for LSK and same goes for Cash(Yes i use Cash) it has a nice ring too it.. And if they are able to make a more viable Cash option for Bitcoin that is awsome, but dont use it against Bitcoin, it should work with.. So as of now i support Litecoin much more than ""bcash"" because ""Coins""(My name for a fraction of a Litecoin) is supporting Bitcoin, not talking shit about it!

Roger does not understand that there is more than enough network effect for a brand new coin as well, he doesnt need to use the Bitcoin name to make his Network usefull! If it usefull the people who need it will use it! That is how the world works! But if people see, no this is some corrupt shit, they go elsewhere.. That is why i am bearish about Bitcoin Cash, and bullish towards Bitcoin and Litecoin(Gold and Silver standard of the 21th century)

But we need one coin that scales onchain, and one that does it off, just in case one of them fail.. But those coin should support each other, so i am still looking for a new proponent.. Right now i am thinking Monero or Dash for Cash! 

What do you think? Which is the best Cash alternative?",1524356198

"Not that simple. 
        
That question dates back from long time and according to his rules, I am considered a “bank in a garage” because I would hold the Bodegas Bitcoins for a little while.
       
From 2014 to 2015, I was working with about 150 bodegas for them to accept bitcoins. I designed the backend of the system they used.
      
This article in the New York Times came out the other day complaining that once can’t use bitcoin *(and blaming bitcoin for it)* and got a bit upset.
    
&gt; https://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/04/16/nyregion/new-york-today-living-on-bitcoin.html
      
The reason there are no Bodegas is because of the Bitlicense, period. I got so piss led that I tweeted the journalist of the New York Times this picture: https://twitter.com/TheoBitcoin/status/985982078528425984 or https://twitter.com/TheoBitcoin/status/875085764438220803 
      
I am pushing hard because now that the NY AG is going after exchanges, everyone is saying “Bravo Kraken” for fighting back.
       
Well, I have simply to say that Kraken folks laugh at my face when I was handing out these flyers. As they were entering the hotel they looked at me smiling saying: “the Bitlicense cost me 100,000 dollars.”
       
This is the flyer: https://twitter.com/TheoBitcoin/status/866686675463933952
     
**I am not selling any ICO** or anything but simply the knowledge that there is a fight that has been going on and that folks should not forget it. 
      
The non profit CoinCenter is pushing bad regulation and because people don’t know I even exist don’t realize that folks are going to jail (google Morpheus or NodeFather.)
       
Bitcoin was not made to make billions of dollars, it was made for something else. If a few people can make money on it, good; but bitcoin is for small business and should remain decentralized. **That is what I am fighting for.**
         
The more people follow me on Twitter, donate to the legal fight in New York against the Bitlicense, get a membership with the bitcoin Foundation, the more chance are our interest protected.

I actually don't insult very often. The fact is, I've *proven* many instances of ""projection"" against me, including using sock-puppets, like [here]().

&gt; Because that made absolutely no sense

Sure it did. You're calling me delusional, and I'm saying that you are the one who is delusional if you can't see that Craig is an obvious fraud. You claimed that 'nothing I said holds any water', but haven't offered any actual rebuttal. Solid.

&gt; Do you also accuse literally everyone of ""ad hominem"" ?

No, in fact, most people accuse me of doing that to Craig, which is dumb, because I'm only pointing out that he's a fraud, and letting people do whatever they want with that information.

"Honest question:

I've been following BTC and the cryptocurrency graphs, markets and news more closely for a couple of months now \- always trying to decide if/when I should buy \- and I'd like to ask a question that I know will probably be unpopular here, but absolutely legitimate.

It is said that BTC will go up a lot more in value as it becomes more widely accepted \(and traditional currencies inflate\) because it is limited in supply. McAfee literally bet his dick that each millionaire in the world would want at least one. I'd even go farther and say that a single BTC would eventually be worth more \(maybe way more\) than a million dollars each if it was the only cryptocurrency. However, looking at the almost two thousand new cryptocurrencies \- a couple quite successful among them \- I ask myself why would people rather not just use another \(maybe a similar, a clone or a different, maybe even ""better"" one \- though ""better"" is relative\) cryptocurrency instead of subjecting themselves to this much speculation with BTC's value?

So far it seems to me that BTC is \(at least since I started following it \- and, just to be clear, I'm talking about the cryptocurrency, not about this subreddit\) much more about speculation \(HODL\) than actual usage as payment \- personally, I'd never spend something that can double, quadruple or even x10\+ in value at any moment.

What I'm trying to ask is:

If the goal is to have one \(or more \- look at USD and EUR\) universally accepted decentralized \(anonymous?\) currency/payment system, what makes Bitcoin \(and no other cryptocurrency\) so special? Why would all the millionaires need/want BTC specifically \(which is what needs to happen in order for it to go so high\) instead of any other cryptocurrency who does the same \(or an even better\) job?",1524349862

"Society has had effectively instant payments for a very long time. You enjoy the convenience of credit and debit cards, and all cash payments are instant and immutable.

Cryptocurrency was created to defeat censorship of the usage of currency and debasement of a currency's value by its issuer. It was not created to maximize for speed. It's very trivial to maximize a payment system for speed, if you simply remove those other properties and/or otherwise centralize it. But then, there's no reason for all the cryptography, because you can trade all this complication away if you are simply willing to trust the currency issuer. Crypto is necessarily as complex and difficult to use as it is specifically so that the user never has to trust anyone. That is the bottom line. There are many approaches that would make it easier to use, easier to mass-adopt, but which would require trusting a third party to some degree. At that point, you are not using a crypto, but rather a company's product, that exists to earn that company money.

To be a crypto user is to understand that all transactions are ""instant"", established the moment the user broadcasts them, and that the difficulty of reversing or undoing transactions starts at some value and increases as time passes, meaning different situations will require different amounts of waiting to satisfy the recipient's concerns. (Accepting unconfirmed BTC/BCH transactions is often safer than accepting a credit card based on charge-back and double-spend frequency. So even using the oldest crypto tech that exists today, you already have the 0.5s transaction times for convenience store purchases you want.) To be a crypto user, is to understand that the more frequently checkpoints/blocks/milestones happen, the easier they are to attack and reverse, and so the more of them are required to pass for a similar level of immutability. (There's a good reason the exchange requires 100 confirmations on your random alt deposit. One miner is 40% of the network.) If your crypto of choice appears to not have this problem, critically evaluate it and you will find one or more of the following: it's centralized, controlled by a single authority, young and relatively untested, or not yet worth someone's time and resources to attack.

Mind you, I have hopes that we can eventually improve usability, speed, and convenience _without_ sacrificing security or requiring any additional trust. I simply don't believe we're there yet. And I find it incredibly dangerous to forget the primary reasons crypto exists, in a rushed or greedy effort to ""sell the world on it"". An un-censorable asset, proven secure over time, quite literally sells itself.",1524349237

"&gt; The amount of research going into this is tremendous,

One big problem lies along these lines. We know how to do privacy on Bitcoin since 2013, yet **everyone is researching fungibility and no one rolls out any product.** I am seeking to change it, more on this later, but I think this is no coincidence and let me elaborate on this.  

The closest we have to a privacy product is JoinMarket, yet it only provides plausibility, Monero-ish privacy with tiny anonymity sets, possibly even weaker than Monero, because there every transaction is a mix, in JoinMarket you are likely not interacting much with other JM users. To add to this, as network fees will grow, JM will become less and less feasible.  

The reason why nobody rolls out privacy products in Bitcoin is: it's freaking risky and it doesn't pay. Consequently we are left with a handful of half implemented, command line projects, as it's so typical in the open source world, the developer runs out of gas. You cannot really blame them though, **who would want to spend years of full time writing software without financial compensation and with a decent probability to get kidnapped by three letter agencies?** Privacy altcoin developers solve both of these issues: you can repeat all day long they work for free, too, but they don't. From personal experience, I worked in the core of an altcoin for a couple of months and even if it wasn't a new alt, the number of money making opportunities were huge, you have such unique insight to the market you can play it basically risk-free. Also it is guaranteed there'll be a handful of other privacy altcoin devs, other than you and you have a feel of security of you're not going to be the first one to be taken by LE and you'll most likely get out just in time, before the shit hits the fan.  

So the question arises: how can we fix this? For long my answer was: well, someone must take one for the team, so I was coding HiddenWallet alone for years now, keeping an alpha version, people could use on the mainnet, yet when in December I was about to finally roll it out with ZeroLink on the mainnet, I have to admit, I didn't have the balls. I had multiple panick attacks. It was stressing me out emotionally: ""I am going to roll out a software on Bitcoin, that doesn't have any privacy flaw anymore, it covers every possible way someone can lose its privacy."" On the one hand I felt incredibly proud of myself, on the other I was afraid. ""Should I move to Thailand or somewhere, burn my phone and be an illegal immigrant, live under the radar?"" I was seriously considering these option. Then ""fortunately"" my public testing were not that successful, the software suffered from multiple stability issues, so I took the opportunity and pivoted back way more than I needed to: today I did not only rewrote the whole codebase of the software, but also the underlying Tor library, hell I even worked on to replace the HTTP and web sockets protocols with a home-grown one (ToT: Tor over TCP) just to gain some miniscule performance increase and stability and have better insight on how things work on deeper network level. That being said I spent a month on ToT, I never quite was able to get that right, so I dropped it eventually. To stay on point: I decided I have to keep it fully legal, because the ""innovate faster than they can keep up with your work"" only works, when you're writing some stupid fitness app to iOS, not on software that outright provides freedom for the people. So I decided to renmae HiddenWallet to a more ""family friendly"" name: Wallet Wasabi, start a company by teaming up with two lawyers, (right away giving up 50% of the company to them!) so they make sure we are doing everything completely legal and we will be able to roll out [a freaking Bitcoin privacy product at last](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/issues/154).",1524349085

"&gt; of course you can't because you have to extrapolate USD/Crypto exchange rate to your future time series. 

USD drops out of the calculation for protecting the network against the only viable / useful attack scenario I've found.  So no, I'm not in that case.

The only time I'm extrapolating USD exchange rate is when I'm also extrapolating transaction growth.  When extrapolating one, extrapolating the other is reasonable - Metcalfe's law.

&gt; go for it. but what exactly are you trying to explain?

Miners are financially incentivized to act in the best interest of the network.  This is the bedrock foundational principle of Bitcoin and all blockchains.  Even proof of stake, DAG's and DPOS blockchains are still founded on this principle.  The only blockchains not reliant on this principle are the most obviously centralized.

Therefore, for an attack involving miner behavior to be successful, enough miners would need to have a larger incentive to act against this best interest rather than for it.  Hypothetically a government attack by taking control of the miners in a particular country is possible, but to describe such an attack sufficiently someone would need to lay out the specific scenario so the game theory and payoffs can be evaluated.  Such a thing would not be without serious costs.  I do not care to lay out that scenario (and no one else has actually tried that I've found) because there's a better scenario that is easier for me to lay out, and appears to encompass the other scenario entirely at the scales Bitcoin has reached.

Attack scenario: An extremely well funded group wishes to attempt to open massive leveraged shorts against Bitcoin and then perform a 51% attack and turn a profit.

This scenario can be calculated by comparing the cost of a 51% attack versus the maximum revenue that could reasonably be earned from such a massive short.

Revenue can be calculated with an upper bound by evaluating the maximum size of a short that could be opened.  Most Bitcoins in existence are not on exchanges and thus not available borrowing for a short sale.  Even among those that are, many exchanges do not offer shorting, and even many of those that do require users to put their bitcoins up for borrowing for leveraged trades.  That cap gives the upper bound.  That cap is entirely in Bitcoins, so dollars don't need to be a part of the equation necessarily.

Likewise the cost of a 51% attack can be evaluated in dollar terms by working backwards from miners' own revenue.  The saturation point guarantees over a long period of time that miners costs' will approach miners revenue.  Miners' revenue is in Bitcoins, therefore dollars don't need to be a part of that equation either.  Balance the two equations where cost == revenue, and then you can calculate the amount of miner revenue needed to invalidate a specific attack.  I picked a range of reasonable values for each variable and got somewhere between 250 BTC/day in miners' payouts and 1,500 BTC/day in miners' payouts (Reward+fees).  I was generous in my assumptions to get that- if I dug into the specific maximum theoretical shorts that could be opened on exchanges using their known cold storage balances, I'd probably get a much lower number.  Mine was based on circulating bitcoins as a percentage of total bitcoins in existence.  On the other side of the equation the only real variable is the average lifespan cost of a mining device, as that's the saturation-point cost of mining device; The attackers would need to buy about that many mining devices (plus build/lease capacity to host them) to perform the attack.

This calculation resulted in numbers much higher than I could imagine any government justifying for the cost of an attack.  If someone wanted to consider government attacks, they'd have to lay out the scenario so the costs &amp; payoffs would be addressed.

&gt; that miners cannot collude, or that the free fee market will ensure they don't? or that if they do, other non-coluuding miners will enter the market? that these non-colluding miners will have enough hast rate to deter the collusion? that miners will then break the collusion?

Collusion isn't a real threat, sorry.  By that I don't mean collusion can't happen, I mean that it is a vague illusory demon that can mean whatever the speaker wishes it to mean, and therefore isn't a point of discussion.  Why would the miners collude?  What is the payoff or benefit for them doing so?  What costs or sacrifices do they have to make?  This is the information that allows the game theory of the attack - and its defenses - to be worked out.  Without them, it's just vague descriptions of boogeymen.

Are you specifically referring to miners colluding in a cartel whitelisting or blacklisting attack?  That collusion is prevented by both market panic collapsing prices and the threat of a softfork or hardfork that blacklists their cartel.  Such a softfork or hardfork wouldn't be pleasant for anyone, and simply sets up a cat and mouse game between the cartel and the developers/exchange/business nodes.  The markets would severely punish everyone for such a thing, but the miners would be hit 100x harder than anyone else by such a market reaction.  That's what prevents a cartel whitelist/blacklist from forming.

Did you mean something else?  Get specific please, ""collusion"" is meaningless without discussing the intents / payoffs / costs of the collusion.",1524348851

Almost all the engineering concepts and ideas had been around in the cryptography community for a long time and there have been many attempts since the early 90s to create ""digital cash"" but none of them quite worked. Satoshi just tweaked some of the ideas and brought them together to create bitcoin. The cost of storage capacity and internet speeds were likely one of the few reasons bitcoin wasn't invented even earlier.

Paypals original goal was to create a global digital currency and Ripple has actually been around since the early 2000s researching and developing years before bitcoin or satoshi.

Lastly, Satoshi did not create bitcoin alone, he had lots of help from KNOWN people helping him in the early days like Hal Finney. In fact Satoshi's code was considered to be sub-par compared to the other early contributors. ",1524348777

He lies on agreements he signs (e.g. ""the bitcoin.com pool will mine with NYA/btc1/2x code... whoops just kidding, we're mining bcash instead"").

"&gt; Is the reward strictly dependant on how many hashes you try to break? Let's say 5 identical PC's mining at same performance doing 1 trillion attempts per hour. Is there any form of luck/chance factor? Could a block be opened in 1min or 25min instead of the average 9-11?

Yes, and this has happened, many times.  It's on average 10 minute blocks.

The reward is given out solely to the person who finds the lucky hash below the difficulty.

&gt; Are the people offering higher fee's to get their transactions made faster automatically picked up by miners or intentionally chosen or by chance? Does the paid fee get evenly distributed?

The miners intentionally include those transactions.  I doubt they share the fees with their pools.

&gt; When the amount of coins is halved in 2020 odds are quite a few miners will stop mining as their revenue is cut in half, would that make the 'bitcoin network' less secure or slow down transactions?

Presumably the price will rise to keep mining profitable.  Even if 90% of miners stop, Bitcoin is more than secure enough.

&gt; Doesn't increasing the amount of coins daily have an impact on price of Bitcoin?

Yes.

&gt; Isn't the current rather big fee's and wait times for transactions a noteworthy problem? Is it about prioritizing safety?

Yes, it's a huge usability problem.  There is some debate on this topic.  I recommend you never visit r/bitcoin or r/btc and you'll be fine.

&gt; Is it necessary to wait for your transaction to go through 6 blocks? Are there security risks only going through 2?

You're probably okay with just a few block confirmations.  For more important or larger payments, wait longer.

&gt; Since the entire blockchain is stored and saved, is it possible to easily go through,find all of Satashi Nakamoto's transactions?

Yes, if you know which addresses belong to him.  All movement of coins is public.  That doesn't mean you know which address corresponds to which person.

&gt; Is Bitcoin Core or other Full nodes necessary to keep the network functioning? 

Nodes are necessary to transmit transactions.  The more the better.

&gt; Does any problems come with GPU's being overtaken by ASIC's, much less nodes, profit much more limited to China/India/Iceland ETC 

It has made Bitcoin more centralized.  In practice, that doesn't seemed to have made the network less secure.

Someone else will have to get this one.",1524346996

&gt; Or I could explain the specifics and you can tell me where my math is wrong. Up to you

go for it. but what exactly are you trying to explain? that miners cannot collude, or that the free fee market will ensure they don't? or that if they do, other non-coluuding miners will enter the market? that these non-colluding miners will have enough hast rate to deter the collusion? that miners will then break the collusion? 

define what you think you are trying to prove, and then go for it. or point to a research paper. one of the two really. I don't have to agree, but if you think your maths is on point, then i am all ears. ",1524346944

"I have thought about it. And I've put a lot of thought into it aswell.  

There are other ways for POW to work without the Guessing competition.  

with your logic, Warren buffet can buy the largest mining farm ever and take control of 90% of the BTC/BCH/Whatever-coin mining. 
He doesnt need to know everytihng about it, he hires people who are experts in their field to do that for him.  

In the end, I think a huge platform coin will be big. A coin/currency that can be used on a platform like ETH or NEO (Or IOTA, hashgraph) and at the same time be used as payment for already existing system. It would be the most logic and versatile option. 

Vitalik actually wanted to make BTC into a dapp platform aswell. So it could both be a payment coin, AND a platform to run dapps. But too many naysayers said no and thus they made ETH.  

I would rather have someone own 90% of the coins, then 90% of the mining market. Because if you own the miners, you can do as you want. With POS you will still get punished if you try to fuck someone, even if you own 90% of the coin. ",1524346766

"How so?  Him and his team co founded the first decentralized p2p social network before ethereum which is striking similar was even a thought.   So he had the credentials to create Bitcoin. There is no doubting that.   

They were NYC students that moved headquarters to San Francisco in 2010.  
They say Satoshi tweeted from the west cost. 

So that correlates with them working out of San fran.

Around the time Satoshi made his supposed last few tweets is when paranoid schizophrenia kicked in, and then he killed himself in late 2011.   2011 is said to be officially the last time he tweeted.    So Satoshi being dead makes sense as a possible reason why he doesn't tweet anymore.         So that also suggests this is very possible.    

They got funded from kickstarter in the amount of 200 k in 2010.    Them needed money, but having BTC makes sense because BTC was worthless at the time.  0.003 each.  


Thats 4 things that connect him. 

English speaker?  They all spoke, and typed very clear , very proper English dispite him being a Russian native.    I,mean, you had to be smart to create diaspora.    


So how can you say not one piece of evidence suggests hes Satoshi?  There's 3 solid things that connect. Him.  

1. Time of mental breakdown, followed by his death matches the time frame of Satoshi's disappearance

2. Creating Diaspora matches the credentials of having thr ability to create Bitcoin 

3. Diaspora team working out of San Fran matches the fact Satoshi communicated from the west coast. 

Now they say a post from Satoshi accounts account came in 2014 saying Dorain was not Satoshi.   But no one knows if that was Satoshi or not because a few people had acces to his account.   

Think about it,     the only thing that people seem to not believe was his typing not matching, but you would literally need all of Satoshi tweets compared to all of llyas communication , and everyone would have to be different ,  if any matches .... Then.  Shit.  Evidence is overwhelming .

"&gt;Is the reward strictly dependant on how many hashes you try to break? Let's say 5 identical mining at same performance doing 1 trillion attempts per hour. Is there any form of luck/chance factor? Could a block be opened in 1min or 25min instead of the average 9-11?

Not strictly, there is a random factor. The network will find one block per 10 minutes on average, but there is variance. Check blockchain.info

&gt;Are the people offering higher fee's to get their transactions made faster automatically picked up by miners or intentionally chosen or by chance? Does the paid fee get evenly distributed?

Miners decide what transactions to include, and they are incentivized to include the transactions with the higher fees because they make more money. Miners can decide to include whatever transactions they want though. Some miners occasionally include no transactions at all, forfeiting the fees . The fee get paid to the miner who included the transaction in his block, so they are not equally distributed among miners.

&gt;Is the maximum transactions limit currently 7 per second?
It depends on the type of transaction ( some are bigger than others ) but I think the maximum average is around 5.


&gt;When the amount of coins is halved in 2020 odds are quite a few miners will stop mining as their revenue is cut in half, would that make the 'bitcoin network' less secure or slow down transactions?

The security is directly proportional to the miners' revenue in USD, so it's the ( reward + transaction fees ) * price . The reward will go down in time, but we're hoping that the fees will go up ( not too much though :), and the price will go up even more to compensate.




&gt;Doesn't increasing the amount of coins daily have an impact on price of bitcoin?
The impact was stronger during the early days, but the inflation rate right now is low and getting lower, so the impact of new minted coins is less and less important


&gt;Isn't the current rather big fee's and wait times for transactions a noteworthy problem? Is it about prioritizing safety?
The thing is, eventually the only thing that is going to secure the network are those fees. So having high fees is both desirable and undesirable.

 &gt;Is it necessary to wait for your transaction to go through 6 blocks? Are there security risks only going through 2?
1 block is enough in 99.9% of the cases. The risk of having a transaction reverted diminishes exponentially with each block. If you're buying a house with bitcoin then waiting a few blocks is better, otherwise one block is safe.




&gt;Since the entire blockchain is stored and saved, is it possible to easily go through,find all of Satashi Nakamoto's transactions?
Satoshi's transactions are on the blockchain, but determining which ones are his cannot be done with 100% certainty. We have some leads because a very early miner mined a lot of coins and his mining nonce followed a repetitive pattern https://bitslog.wordpress.com/2013/04/17/the-well-deserved-fortune-of-satoshi-nakamoto/


 &gt;Is Bitcoin Core or other Full nodes necessary to keep the network functioning? Is Bitcoin Core outdated compared to other alternatives? From what I have read the 200gigs, memory usage etc. Are there risks to having too few full node miners? And do full node miners get any more incentives to use full nodes?
Full nodes are necessary, bitcoin core is not mandatory in theory. In practice bitcoin core is the reference client. It's far from being obsolete as it's continuously updated by the core team. It's a cutting edge piece of software, the memory usage are cause by storing the full blockchain, although most users do not need to store the full blockchain ( you can keep only the relevant bits which are quite smaller )


&gt;Does any problems come with GPU's being overtaken by ASIC's, much less nodes, profit much more limited to China/India/Iceland ETC
Normal nodes do not require ASICS but mining nodes do. Whether ASIC are a good or a bad thing for the network's health is a huge debate. I won't get into it but there are definitely trade-offs to each option.

* Reversing a transaction becomes exponentially more difficult the more blocks a transaction is buried under 

does that imply that it's possible to reverse a transaction at its 1-5th block? As far as I've read its completely impossible once u hit send, is there something I am missing?

And even though the halving of mine rewards didn't have an impact on the value of bitcoin  didn't it basically halve the amount of miners total? Or did the miners just accept that they're getting much less profits or did people start paying higher fees to compensate?

By the time spamming becomes a thing (which likely wouldn't happen until it was being used), we would already be working on the next pieces to the puzzle. At the same time, if you're making a protocol you should think it through and build in some kind of protection capabilities, even if they are only reserved and not yet implemented. Its up to the client to show you what matters, and filter out the noise however that should happen. It doesn't mean we stop with this idea, and mistakes are ok too. Lets figure it out. 

I agree that decentralizing DNS is critical, that should really be a priority imo, but it does highlight that the existing systems are not working for release groups like they once did. The centrality is always the problem.

Maybe I'm naive here but I'm not concerned about the network being attacked as a whole by governments.

"Short Answer: ETH is more than likely undervalued if most of its investors viewed it the same as they did before the Winter Hype. I have no idea on other cryptos. 

Tl;dr

If you were to go back from when ETH started trading (the very beginning). And plot how many people used ETH (regularly, usually developers) against the price of ETH you would see a modest positive relationship. Typically swings would occur consistently around new ETH account sign ups, my assumption speculators coming into the ETH market.

The largest of these swings of course started during the winter boom/ bust cycle. Essentially ETH was on its way to being a healthy $750-850, based on normal user activity, and the winter hype drove it waaayyyy up.

ETH has advantages as the developers choice for smart contracts and as more developers choose to use it will continue to support the currency. 

$600 still seems low to me, but I’m not expecting it to jump to $1200, or even back to $800. If it does I feel like the market wouldn’t keep it there long. 

Remember most things trade at a multiple of their true value. So let’s say ETH is actually only worth $40, but it is trading at a 20x multiple (which is not uncommon for tech stock) eg trading at $800. There is validity in that valuation. The issue is the market has not yet determined the standard multiple for crypto...",1524340172
"Thank you for explaining the issue so clearly!

One question though: my understanding is that when a Bitcoin user signs a message, this reveals the public key.  So an ECC break would allow all those corresponding private keys to be recuperated, and corresponding funds to be stolen.  This would essentially be the end of the story, regardless of the possibility to silently inflate.

So, if there is a concern about an ECC break, shouldn't the signing feature be removed, as well as any other operation which may reveal the public key?

If it is not removed, then I would argue that the risk of silent inflation is on an equal footing, and hence acceptable. ",1524340132

The Nebraska Legislature did not do away with the bill.  I saw the video.  It's good people testified, but the bill is still being considered.  It is an active bill in the Nebraska legislature, just like the active bitlicense proposals in Connecticut. Hawaii. and Alaska right now.  [Just look at the bills promoted by the ULC and Coin Center](http://www.uniformlaws.org/Legislation.aspx?title=Regulation%20of%20Virtual-Currency%20Businesses%20Act) -- LB 987 is one of them.  LB 695 (also from Nebraska Legislature), which some ""bitcoin proponents"" have advocated for is really no better -- it would give the State Department of Administrative Services oversight authority (albeit on a ""limited"" level, which no doubt would expand over time) over virtual currency use in the state of Nebraska.  Nebraska's LB 691 is on hold, but could easily be brought back (remember we had to defeat similar bills in California ***not once, but three times*** in order to kill them off, and ***even that wasn't enough in California*** -- we had to find a way to get rid of the bill's author as well (Dababneh), who now we've managed to force out of the legislature due to our exposure of his scandals).  The Nebraska bills (all three of them that I am aware of) are all bad bills.  I don't agree that this is a good path forward.  And if people think it is a good path, why doesn't everyone who uses the U.S. dollar feel it is necessary to get a license or subject oneself to audits or investigations of the Nebraska Department of Administrative Services merely to be able to use the dollar?  ***Because it's not necessary, and because such a requirement is arguably a violation of the U.S. Constitution's Commerce Clause.***  You know this, Theo, because you are fighting against New York's bitlicense in court.

I understand you have your own objections to Andreas but I think we need to appeal for his help to defeat the bitlicense proposals in Connecticut. Hawaii. Nebraska and Alaska, and for that reason I once again appeal to /u/andreasma to consider my request to do a video on this subject and why it's important for people not just across the U.S.A., but beyond, to advocate against proposals such as those now being introduced in Connecticut.

That they shill bcash is one thing, but they explicitly do so by harassing the members of this sub (private messages) and by trashing bitcoin. This is still a bitcoin sub and people should be able to discuss bitcoin without being harassed.

The bcash business model is based on destroying bitcoin. Both @bitcoin and bitcoin(.)com are owned by Roger Ver and spout anti bitcoin propaganda every minute of the day.

"IMHO When people talk of bitcoin, they are using the wrong denomination.

Bitcoins should be thought of as the gold bars (1000g of gold) of crypto currency.  The middle class could/should never own a gold bar, as there are better ways to store wealth (land, stock, etc).

Similarly mBTC's analog would be an ounce of gold.

When thinking about Bitcoin as a currency bits and satoshi's are the denominations that middle class people will use.

Now, let me hit you with some napkin math on why precisely bits and satoshi's will be what people speak in if/when BTC hits mainstream.

The GDP per capital over the entire world is roughly valued at [$8000USD/year](https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2006/MateNagy.shtml).  This includes the richest of the rich, and poorest of the poor.  By 2030 the worlds population will be 8.5billion people.  Thus we can napkin math and say that the GDP of the world in 2030 might be close to 70trillion dollars. *note: obviously the networth of the entire world is much higher than this, but lets go with GDP percapital for our maths here*

If Bitcoin becomes the dominant unit of trade by 2030, this means that the 21Million bitcoin will cover the value of that 70trillion gdp.  Meaning that a bitcoin would be worth around $3.2M USD.

Obviously, such exchanges are going to be extraordinarily rare.  But what about satoshi's.  a bitcoin worth 3.2M would mean a satoshi is worth 3.2 cents, and thus a bit would be worth 3.2 dollars.

Now THOSE are nice units of value for common trade.  You'll basically be paying 50 satoshi for a candy bar, which isn't an alien value for people to understand.",1524336598

"**Forth (programming language)**

Forth is an imperative stack-based computer programming language and environment originally designed by Charles ""Chuck"" Moore. Language features include structured programming, reflection (the ability to modify the program structure during program execution), concatenative programming (functions are composed with juxtaposition) and extensibility (the programmer can create new commands). Although not an acronym, the language's name is sometimes spelled with all capital letters as FORTH, following the customary usage during its earlier years.

A procedural programming language without type checking, Forth features both interactive execution of commands (making it suitable as a shell for systems that lack a more formal operating system) and the ability to compile sequences of commands for later execution.

"Honest question and yes I'm putting on the tin foil hat for this. Let's say a global crypto currency is established via satellite internet access across the globe. What stops crazy people or world leaders from shooting/disabling said satellites and therefore ruining global economy? 

Just asking because I've also thought of this before, but realized satellites are physical things vulnerable to attack unlike our crypto. It's not like you can ask the entire world to not buy anything for a day or two while some world government figures out what to do on a situation like that.

Crazy ass future theory stuff, but I'm just curious to see your thoughts. ",1524336196

"It’s really crazy because the general public is just kind of along for the ride while big smart money takes advantage of sentiment.  And these people/groups aren’t mind readers nor do they probably even understand it in a psychological aspect...  They’re working numbers that are published for everyone to see in the form of long and short positions.  And they’re using relatively small amounts of money to make these plays in comparison to wallstreet players, all while raking exponential gains and pushing it back and forth over and over again.  All the while, Joe Schmoe Coinbase “investor” doesn’t know which way to go and starts fomoing and panic selling all of over the place because he’s operating purely on emotion and has no knowledge or experience in investing and no clue wtf is going on.  

What sparked this last run was a deliberate short squeeze on a bunch of shorts, then whaddayaknow... the sheeps start following.  The memes begin.  The news spreads on tv social media etc and more lemmings come in.  Even some of the guys who bought high sold low and swore off crypto are back.  Because of the unprecedented 24/7 nature of crypto and because we are all so connected online, things happen rapidly.  

I think we’ll continue to have this volatility until institutions and government formally embrace bitcoin.  I think there will be one decisive time period where something huge happens.  Amazon accepts bitcoin, big governments embrace and formally regulate, top tier financial institutions integrate etc.  At that moment an unprecedented surge happens and we never look back.

As I see it now short term, smart big money will continue to swallow up dumb money.  It’s become especially easy for them with all the newly accessible big leverage trading newbs are doing, makes plays swift and easy.  

The good news is, neither Joe Schmoe or big money want the gravy train to end so the same people causing these dips will make sure not to let bitcoin die.  Whales might get greedy and let the sheeps drive the price down quite a bit (all while continuing to nudge the price up/down at strategic times), but we’re all long in the long run. Government really is the only thing that could put a serious hurting on this space.  Assuming there is no negative interventions by multiple big governments, I see no where but up in the long term.  In the short though, it’ll be a wild ride up full of lemming bubbles and big Willy’s moving this market on a slow and steady incline.  

Adoption and awareness continue to grow each and every day.  I see bitcoin in the news literally every day.  This is NOT beanie babies or pogs.  This is 10 year old revolutionary technology.  It has attracted some of the greatest talent in the world who’ve investing their lives personally and professionally into it.  This technology is the logical progression of the digital age.  It solves multiple existing problems.  Like the internet, we haven’t conceived even a fraction of what this technology will be used for or where it will go 10-20-30 years from now.  The biggest block chain projects that will ever exist are decades away from conception, the people who will make them probably in diapers right now.

Wow that got long winded, but back to my original point which was market sentiment...  It’s really and drives the interim between whale plays or other large unforeseen events.  I’ve found it interesting to watch and has taught me a lot about the human psyche in relation to finance.  My conclusion is that holding and accumulating the dips and having patience and discipline is my way to the lambo.  I don’t think it’ll be long now either, few years worst case.  Crypto and Blockchain have hit the mainstream.  Imo now is the best time to invest.  Least downside risk and a ton of upside.  Hats off to the OGs because you all were nuts having big money in this 5+ years ago.  That was a risk and you deserve your rewards.  To the new investors, this is a cakewalk.  Buy it forget it and buy more when you can, especially on dips.  Get educated on your investments, be disciplined, don’t invest a dime you need anytime soon and most importantly do your part to move adoption forward.  Ask every business you frequent to accept crypto.  Accept crypto at your business.  Give crypto to your friends and family for Christmas instead of Visa cards.  Comment on articles and twitter.  Every word spoken or written moves us one step in a positive direction.

"That is not a different question.  You're missing the point in the same way Krugman did.

In the passage I quoted, he specifically said, ""*Everyone agrees that it's technically very sweet*"", but doesn't seem to realise that if the technology *is* that it works as money, he's already just effectively said that everyone agrees that it works very well as money.

Anyone who admires the technical details of bitcoin must do so in the context of what it is (a mechanism for storing and transferring value).  It's not ""technically very sweet"" in way other than in how it provides for the capability to do what it does.

To put it as simply as I can, ""the technology"" is ""it works as money"".  You can't say one is good and the other is unknown.  You can say, ""it's unknown"" (or ""it's bad""), but then you have to admit you're disagreeing with the people who say ""it's good"".",1524335914

IOTA has already gained traction and are building amazing use cases. Latest the prototype of a charging station driven by IOTA. I could see stuff like this grow really hyge.

Yes, and Monero too. It's great to see projects experiment with technology to let it mature, but they also take risks that I don't think would be acceptable to Bitcoin (see elsewhere in this thread, the risk of silent inflation).


&gt; Also, shouldn't it be possible to prune the blockchain (Bitcoin Core already has this feature) and introduce CT / Bulletproofs ""on"" the pruned chain (as a fork, obviously) ?

"Well it is kind of true. I think there are actually two closely related types on decentralization in bitcoin. 

1) The network that’s described in the whitepaper is designed such that there is no central authority for the minting of new coins and processing of transactions. Hence Satoshi proposed a “distributed” timestamp server, which is a form of decentralization. ie. the blockchain and proof of work mining enables the confirmation of transactions without requiring a trusted central authority. 

2) The problem then is how to ensure the chain can’t be corrupted by dishonest nodes. This is simple, honest nodes must maintain more than 50% of hashing power. Our second form of decentralization. If colluding, dishonest miners hold more than 50% of the network’s hashing power, then it is no longer “decentralized” in this second sense. 

But I should add that the only thing dishonest miners can do is reverse or block their own or other’s transactions. So, game-theoretically, even a 51% dishonest miner is incentivized to stay honest because they have a lot more to gain from mining than they do from crashing the price of their bitcoin assets by screwing with network security.

"In a system that uses CT, if someone finds a break in the fundamental security of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), he can print money. Worse, because the amounts are all private, he can do so *undetectably*. That's an existential threat for a currency which has controlled inflation as prime goal.

Such a break would be dangerous for Bitcoin (even without CT) regardless, as it relies on ECC for protecting against theft. However, Bitcoin can migrate to use a different signature scheme if necessary. It would be chaotic, but not necessarily pose an existential risk.

There are people who agree with this perspective. It's a mathematical fact that any privacy system that hides amounts and is built on top of ECC will at least have one of the properties below:

* An ECC break will permit printing money undetectaby.
* An ECC break will permit deanonymizing amounts in the historical chain.

So we are faced with a choice between those two regardless if we want better privacy. Some people believe the second is worse than the first, and choosing the first actually allows for more efficient technology. This is a choice that Zcash, Monero, Grin,  all make. CT with Bulletproofs would do the same.

However, regardless of your own opinion in this matter, Bitcoin's evolution is a large collaborative process, where such fundamental changes need buy-in from large parts of the ecosystem. My fear is that the question of giving up the ability to exactly audit the monetary supply is going to make it hard to make CT acceptable.

Furthermore, there are other challenges. CT makes transactions larger, slower to verify, and poses a very significant engineering challenge to incorporate into Bitcoin without breaking backward compatibility.

There is lower hanging fruit to improve, however.

Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is an encryption program that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication. PGP is used for signing, encrypting, and decrypting texts, e-mails, files, directories, and whole disk partitions and to increase the security of e-mail communications. Phil Zimmermann developed PGP in 1991.

PGP and similar software follow the OpenPGP standard (RFC 4880) for encrypting and decrypting data.

***

**Key signing party**

In public-key cryptography, a key signing party is an event at which people present their public keys to others in person, who, if they are confident the key actually belongs to the person who claims it, digitally sign the certificate containing that public key and the person's name, etc. Key signing parties are common within the PGP and GNU Privacy Guard community, as the PGP public key infrastructure does not depend on a central key certifying authority, but to a distributed web of trust approach. Key signing parties are a way to strengthen the web of trust. Participants at a key signing party are expected to present adequate identity documents.

You should understand one thing very very clearly in trading, you have to decide what *style* suits you in terms of frequency of trading. One *method* from *one* mentor, and then study that *one* method until you have mastered it.

Trading is a game of *masters* who take the money from the people who are just experts. You can be an expert in 10 trading methods and the master in 1 will still be better off.

Also consider your end goal is simple, to be right more than 51% of the time. With this and correct money management you will win in the long run. If you can be right just 60% of the time in time you are literally going to kick ass. Trust me when that time comes you will realize it is almost impossible to teach someone, you could take them to ""pro"", but only they can go from there to expert to master.

"I haven’t seen a single thread really going in any sort of depth in regard to human psychology relating to bitcoin (or crypto in general).

It’s been interesting to watch, and a playground for more seasoned investors.  I’d love to get some hard data on sentiment, because that’s what really shifts this market one way or another.  The smart big money players who know the system just move it back and forth gobbling up the weak hands.  

I personally have noticed the sheep mentality.  And also how short people’s memories and attention spans really are.  It’s really an interesting age and I attribute much of it to the way we are connected and so heavily reliant on the internet, social media &amp; the ease of 24/7 communication.  Now with 24/7 market places, it allows for rapid market shifts based on single tweets whereas back in the day things moved so much slower.  When they say a week in bitcoin is like a month in the regular markets, it’s almost true.

To make a long story short, people are idiots and easily manipulated.  ",1524330023
"&gt; And 0-conf (on BCH) has proven to be relatively safe, and it can/will be made more safe.

It is relatively safe, because it is not widely accept. *If* the adoption of BCH increases the frauds will certainly ramp up. I think it is important that the merchants know they can lose 0-confs. If they know, they can calculate the risk and plan accordingly. If they don't know they will get disappointed and blame Bitcoin. The latter way is a terrible efficient way to develop an anti-Bitcoin rally by merchants.

So in my eyes: never pretend that 0-confs are safe, if it's only ""safe enough"". Tell people about the risks, and they can live with it happily!

"&gt; TL;DR: Decentralized stable coins are coming and could have significant negative impact on coins/projects now focused on currency/payments/store-of-value. Speculative money will shift to coins with non-currency focus (e.g. smart contracts or something).

Interesting points. 

Taxation is a real problem. BTC has been promoted as anything but a currency since the lightning goons took it over. 

There is a fair chance BCH will be treated as a currency for tax purposes once it shows it IS meant to be one. Authorities have shown some inclination to treat cryptos as currencies, the problem is that BTC has been consistently telling them since 2014 that they're not. Change is possible in this area.

Stability is a relative term. Is fiat stable? It's fair to say they are not in many ways. Stability should come to BCH (stable price increases) once actual real world commercial transactions gain in importance. 

BTC as a mindless speculative ponzi has an unstable price for good reason: Bitcoin is not crypto, has been emptied of value and is not a suitable reference or example. Same applies to LTC and many other tokens.",1524329467

"I think arguments can be made for why it's a good thing that Ethereum and Bitcoin are two separate things. It's complicated enough to implement something that can serve as a global payment system without adding additional functionality on top of that. 

From an engineering standpoint Bitcoin's network structure is incredibly inefficient, but that's the price we pay for a permissionless system. In my opinion we need to recognise the limitations that we suffer as a consequence. Lightning is a way of not having to store every single transaction on the blockchain, but rather periodically store state as it looks like at that point in time. In my opinion storing everything on\-chain is unrealistic, and even more so if you want Ethereum like functionality or to be able to store non\-transactional data on the Blockchain. I disagree that storage isn't an issue. Personally I found running a full node on my computer to be not that pleasant as it demands a pretty large amount of storage space, and that's with a 1mb block limit. I can only imagine what it must be like for someone living in worse circumstances, where hard drives and network bandwidth might be harder to come by.

"&gt; The second the miners in a pool stop getting paid is when they stop sharing their hashpower. That's why 51% attacks from large nodes with hundreds or thousands of ""miners"" (really just hash calculators) are completely null; they take effect for a few hours at most before the majority of miners just give up trying to get paid. 

You don't seem to understand what a ""51%"" attack is.  Pools would do 51% attacks to earn MORE coins in the long run -- not to stop paying their members. 

If  three pools with 51% of the hashpower were to collude to (say) orphan the blocks of all other pools, miners would migrate TO those cartel pools, not AWAY form from them.

&gt; The miners choose to mine whatever is the most profitable, which is what they should be doing

Exactly.

If a miner is mining on his own and has only 1% of the total hashpower, its best strategy (that maximizes his expected profit) is the ""selfish greedy"" one: mine honestly on the longer valid chain that he knows about.  That is why Satoshi thought that his protocol would work.

However, if three pools have more than half of the total hashpower, they can make more profit by other strategies than the ""selfish greedy"" one.  For example, as said above, they can ignore the blocks of all other miners.  Once the difficulty adjusts in their chain, they would be taking 100% of the rewards and fees with the same hashing work.  Or they can take bribes to freeze certain coins. Or they can demand that you pay 50% of your coins to let you move them.  And so on.  That is why Satoshi's proofs do not hold for the current bitcoin network.

&gt; Obviously not everyone who likes Bitcoin is a criminal or a fraud

That is a very bold statement there... ;-)

&gt; Non-mining nodes do not validate transactions

Believers claim that the mission of non-mining ""nodes"" is to validate the work of miners, to protect the system against malicious ones.  That is utter bullshit: those ""nodes"" only break Satoshi's proofs, they have no motivation to validate anything or relay the right data,  and there is no way to tell whether a ""node"" is doing its job.  But it is the believers' claim.

&gt; [UASF] was essentially just an attempt to convince users into a separate fork with transactions incompatible with previous versions. This was in no way a sybil attack on Bitcoin.

You may define ""sibyl attack"" in various ways, but the name does not matter.  The important thing is that Core and its supporters intended to impose a minority branch as the ""official"" branch of the chain, by controlling the majority of **numbers** of those (cheap) nodes, rather than a majority of the (expensive) hashpower.",1524327345
"Signals mean jack shit with bitcoin because you can never know how much miners are actually releasing or not releasing at what time frame.  Nor do you know what old bitcoin holders are waiting for in terms of signals to sell large holdings.

Consistely delivering alpha then becomes a near statistical impossibility.

In the case of Bitcoin, the log returns follow a Levy-Stable distribution with infinite variance.
How on earth is TA supposed to work with a probability density function that wild? 

Plus, why would Tone Vays make any of his predictions public when he could simply trade on his calls and make a killing? Given a decent sample size of profitable trades I'm sure he'd have no trouble raising enough capital to start his own hedge fund.

"Typing one hand so excuse me. Don't take what I say as gospel just an element of my trading strategy in other markets. It is more a theory.

-two types of traders : institutional and retail 
-most retail traders are losers, you might have heard this somewhere like ""95% of retail traders fail"" or something.
-retail traders don't have the power to move the market as much as the institutional players. They make the big moves. They are lines of thought and strategies developed around identifying when these ""big players"" do their moves and if certain moves are made by them etc. Maybe can be considered ""whales"" in crypto.

Another strategy to this, is to do the opposite of what retails do since they are losing most of the time. Hence there are A lot of people who use the retail sentiment as an indicator. They start to go short when they see retail sentiment is at high levels I.e. net longs and buy when net shorts are at high levels.

In regards to your post about 90% and 10%, if this is just orders, think about how say 100 orders from 100 people would not have the power to the move the market as one whale. How people say the top 5% own more then 70% or whatever. So some might argue 90% are long doesn't mean much, when the top 10 can move the market how they please.

Tldr : quite abit of information out there that retail traders positions are usually most concentrated at points of reversal. And they are on the wrong side of the trade at these points. ",1524325061

"&gt; Ah, this is what I like to call the ""McGuffin"" theory of money. ""Money can be anything, maaaaaaannnnnnn, as long as we all agreeeeeee."" No, it can't be anything. It has to have a real utility value. It cannot be entirely arbitrary. 

thanks for injecting i never said.  Bitcoin can be money b/c the market has figured out how to identify exactly what is a good money:  divisibility, fungibility, security, and immutability.

&gt;BCH does indeed have a real commodity value, and is a ""good"" in its own right. If it couldn't be used to do anything valuable, it could not serve as money, ever. 

imo, you confuse the issue when you use terms like commodity and good to describe Bitcoin.  it is neither of those; it skipped that step and went straight to being a money when 10000BTC were traded for two pizzas.  that established a price according to the objective value of money theory.  and off we went.

&gt;""Popular delusion"" is not a viable long-term strategy for sustaining asset prices. Economic fundamentals always assert themselves.

i'm not sure why you throw these terms around; it has nothing to do with Bitcoin.

&gt;The cost to add to the supply of gold closely tracks real energy costs, and varying the degree of energy that is thrown at gold will vary the amount of new gold that is brought to market. Bitcoin mining simply does not mimic this important characteristic. The implications of this are profound and under-appreciated.

i totally disagree. i think creating more gold supply by increasing mining is a distinct negative.  did it occur to you that 2% annual growth of population and consumption is actually unsustainable as it compounds?  Bitocin's fixed 21M coin supply will level off growth of a fixed resource planet.  of course, technology will continue to advance improving all our lives.

&gt;Haha, now that one is just silly, because it completely negates that fact that there are costs to deep sea mining and asteroid mining. Huge costs. Much larger than the costs of conventional mining!

i used to laugh at that one too until i started doing some research on how they are already landing probes on asteroids https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/30/health/rosetta-landing-comet-philae/index.html

those asteroids are filled with heavy metal assets lik gold, IOW huge supplies.  when those get harvested, the gold price will plummet and there will go your money attribute. ",1524325033

"Republic Protocol (Ren), soon to be listed on Huobi.

Republic Protocol (https://republicprotocol.com/) is building a decentralized dark pool. For those unfamiliar with dark pools in traditional markets ""Dark pools, a type of alternative trading system, give investors the opportunity to place orders and make trades without publicly telegraphing their intentions until the sale has been executed. They are mostly used by institutional investors for block trades involving a large number of securities.”

It is estimated that about 40% of US equities are traded on dark pools.

What does this mean for crypto since some places already offer OTC like Kraken Dark Pool? Well Republic is building a decentralized dark pool where users are always in control of their private keys. They have already partnered with 2 liquidity partners and are adding even more. If the belief is true institutional money is coming to crypto, then a decentralized dex seems like the next logical step with even potentially low fees of 1% being a massive amount of btc/eth to node runners.

About Republic and the REN token: None other than Loi Luu that was involved in Ethereum, Kyber, Zilliqa, and now Republic advises the project. They are also backed by both Polychain capital and Signum capital with Polychain being the premier VC fund in the crypto space and Signum being another major fund.

The Republic Protocol uses cryptography to hide the order book and prevent malicious actors from potentially revealing it and is completely open source and decentralized. (https://github.com/republicprotocol).

The REN token has several utilities. The first is 100k REN allows you to run a node on a CPU in which you get a transaction fees for all the orders your node matches on the platform. Additionally if you have 100k REN plus a yet to be determined amount of btc, eth, or erc20 you can opt to run a liquidity node for additional benefits (https://medium.com/republicprotocol/ren-collateralized-nodes-introduction-to-darknodes-566d7a5d2899). Users can accept fees in eth, btc, or erc20 tokens. Additionally all traders are required to use REN as a bond to discourage malicious behavior on the platform.

The entire dex dark pool is built around atomic swaps with testnet launching in May, mainnet in q3 with btc, eth, and erc20 atomic swaps, followed by ltc in q4, and additional blockchains in 2019. And lastly they are working on adding a fiat option, but that will be explored in greater detail post mainnet, but it is part of their plans.

I hope this helps shed light on what I believe is a really great project and one that will directly benefit from the proposed influx of institutional money we all expect to come to crypto in the very near term.

*Basic math... 4000 nodes splitting a 100 million daily volume at a low dex rate of .1% = nearly 10k per year in fees, not including appreciation. Again I fully expect the first dex dark pool to do far more daily volume in due time, but at least thats a realistic number to work off of.",1524324850

Only 20% of society is destined for power.  This is true of ANY society.  Pareto shows it's true under communism and capitalism and socialism and feudalism.

If you want to be wealthy, bitcoin is just one tiny part of it.  I retired at age 41.  I've invested in bitcoin since 2012.  Bitcoin only accounts for 6% of my wealth.  It's not a lot.  It's a tiny part.

The biggest reason I am wealthy is because I don't volunteer myself to poverty.  I am retired young with a lot of money but I can't afford cable TV or high speed internet.

BIP70, for better or worse, does ensure that the transaction is going to the correct blockchain fork (not a problem in 2012), for the non-BCH currencies (ostensibly) that fees are correct (not a problem in 2012), and ensures the user did not improperly copy the payment amount (users can easily lose decimal precision or worse if left to their own devices.)

Further, it took BCH 6mo to launch cash address format, despite this being something that was obviously needed before the fork (I tried in vain to alert all the people involved in developing and launching BCH before the fork and it fell on deaf ears.)  Bitpay took the initiative and made a unique address encoding which followed previous conventions.   I applaud Bitpay for showing leadership here, and my opinion is that it was a blunder not to have followed their lead immediately, and later pursued enhancements such as BECH32 addressing.    During this time Bitpay continued to not wait for the community to solve the problems of their business (and incidentally nearly any business that accepts BTC or BCH), instead taking the initiative and using BIP70 to solve a real problem for their business model.

I strongly suspect you've never supported a company with lots of users sending Bitcoin.   These are valid problems and Bitpay is right to try to solve them as best as they can in the immediate term.

That would imply that I would not want to make complaints more than I want play with shorting. I think I take making complaints where I see appropriate.

&gt;So lawmakers anticipated the demand for immutable public ledgers and said, yes, we want to limit an individuals right to willingly give up that privacy by transacting on a immutable public record? GDPR was started in 2012. It was approved in 2016. Public blockchains do more transactions in a day right now that they did during the whole year of 2012. If they could do that, why didn't they long BTC at the time?

"allowing spending of unconfirmed parents is asking for trouble. transactions malleability makes this very risky imho. Their other requirements are a direct result of what is required by law and by the banks they are doing business with. You don't like it, you better not use them. Or Coinbase or exchanges. As soon as an exchange into fiat is being made businesses and individuals will run into issues. Ignoring the reality in real life (banks being difficult and the state knocking on doors) is cool if you are anonymous. Not so much if you are a business and therefor very public. Businesses like cheapAir are unlikely to deal in crypto directly. If they do they run into the same issues

If you think it can be done differently maybe you should start a payment processor. See how it goes.

I have no hate for the poor.  I love the poor.  Imagine an entire 80% of society who can not stop spending and daydreaming but they work 40-60 hours a week for $0 net worth growth.  That means that 80% of society grinds themselves to the bone VOLUNTARILY to enrich guys like me.  **I love the poor**.  I want to see them have more ""freedom"" to buy more $200 pairs of sneakers and $30 avocado toast.  Hell, I want to build more hospitals and colleges for them to be distracted with.

Do you think the average rich person you know will actually tell you that they're happy you are a poor grunt who enriches them?  Of course not.  I'm one of the few honest people in the world.

&gt; If anything you should use the wealth and resources towards solving the very problems you have highlighted.

Read Pareto.  These are not problems.  This is nature working as nature intended.  I support nature.  You can't ""fix"" what isn't broken.

&gt; You are describing spoilt offsprings of rich people. Who have no money by end of the month despite fat paychecks.

I was in some of the ""poorest"" neighborhoods in America, Africa, and Asia in the past 2 years.  I've seen how much crap the poor people buy with their meager incomes.  They refuse to save because as soon as they see their neighbor buy some plastic bullshit, they want it, too.  Go spend a few weeks on /r/personalfinance and see the number of morons who continue to live like there's no tomorrow.  It's amazing.

&gt; I am squarely referencing to people who are born poor and have little means to get access to simple ladders

You can't fix that.  The market and nature fixes it.  There are millions of powerful people on the planet today who came from dirt poverty 1-2 generations ago.  Millions.

If a poor person wants to be powerful, they have to shit on their people.  Guys like Kanye (who I mentioned) shat on his race and class to become powerful.  He sells those grunts $200 sneakers and $100 perfumes, lol.  Smart fucking guy.

Look at anyone who came out of poverty -- the products they sell are marketed to the poor people to make them think they're not poor.

"&gt;If a smaller miner succeeds in getting multiple blocks he hit a statistical outlier and would be getting more profit; not less.

This isn't what I meant when I say ""in a row""...

If you're a small miner, let's say you average 1 block a week. Sometimes there's 2 blocks a week, sometimes there's 1 block every 2 weeks.

If the block you get this week has significantly less fees than the usual, and then the block you get next week also has less than usual, that's ""2 blocks in a row"".

What happens when you, by randomness, get strung out and haven't had a block in 2 weeks, and then the block you get is significantly sub-par in reward...and then there's another 2 week gap until the next block, and that one is also sub-par?

This is what I mean by in a row.

Large miners can eat this, small miners can't.

This isn't about making profit, this is about eating volatility. Big difference.

&gt;1: Has already been tried with BTC and leads to a double blind auction resulting in chaotic transaction costs. I'm personally in favor of no blocksize limit.

You can't say #1 has already been tried, and then say it failed because transaction costs for were chaotic. I'm not sure why you expect anything in this space to stabilize when the ball has barely begun rolling yet.

&gt;The steady flow of income is already built into the halving algorithm.

That's the opposite of steady. It's an exponential decrease with 98% of the supply already in circulation by 2032.

You have to look at it as Reward/Total_Supply, and that drops exponentially, ie: not steady.

&gt;a culling of unprofitable miners

There's a huge difference between market self-regulation, and a system that is systematically designed to centralize mining down to 1 entity.

&gt;The blocksize has no influence over fees unless intentionally used to do so.

That's the point.

&gt;It was originally used in the early days as a spam filter.

""We had a rain overflow issue on the side of our house so we built a drain, now the excess rain empties into the street, and not into our basement. Ever since then we haven't had an issue with rain overflow, so now we're going to get rid of the drain.""

k

&gt;Today it's too expensive to DDoS the mempool with low fee TX. 

...because of the restricted block size.

&gt;The onus of protecting the mempool and block propagation is on the miners which is why we pay them to validate our TX.

No it's not. Your trust in the miners to ""do the right thing"" is absurd.

""The onus of protecting the people and money creation is on the governments which is why we pay them taxes to validate our claims to land and properties and human rights.""

lol

&gt;the same Moores Law growth of hash/kwh that also allows larger blocksize

You're forgetting about network latency dude. Oh wait...

&gt;The onus of block propagation is on the miners

I almost forgot it's the miners responsibility to ensure those larger blocks can propagate out to the network of full nodes that check &amp; balance them...lol

Bitcoin's lack of infinite inflation looks great for the poor, certainly.  The problem is that the poor will still spend more than they make.  Bitcoin's lack of infinite inflation has one amazing side effect: when people take loans in bitcoin, they end up never being able to pay them back because the valuation increase of bitcoin over time means they will never catch up.

The company founders are on Telegram and are upfront and honest.  They are on track and quite frankly moving very fast to bring a working product out.  This is the time to buy while the INGX coins are undervalued.  Once the marketing starts and the platform goes live the price will jump.

"&gt; To me it feels like we have come to a point where bankers have successfully taken over the bitcoin. Now they are black listing users and addresses. We have lost bitcoin to their ""system of control""…
&gt;
&gt; Do you think we should give up bitcoin and go fully Zcash and fight back to destroy bitcoin itself becasue it is now ""permissioned"" ledger.
&gt;

Bitcoin itself has very little surface to ""take over"" and no evidence that the usual suspects have tried (*cue rbtc theme music*), except perhaps in very clumsy ways. What you're concerned about is actually a small collection of current user-facing Bitcoin companies, a collection which historically has had high turnover, poor understanding of the system, and little ability to affect its functionality beyond creating large volumes of low-efficiency transactions.

One example of their poor understanding of the system is how willing they are to play along with chainanalysis schemes, which is counter to their own interests because they're essentially claiming that they're able to detect certain types of behaviour on the blockchain when this is actually impossible (in general, that is -- ordinary users who don't take extra steps are affected). Not to mention the direct cost of storing this data, shipping it off to analysis companies, storing the results, etc.

I agree that this behaviour is extremely concerning and dangerous to Bitcoin, but to the extent that it's a problem caused by Bitcoin itself, it's one that's been around for a long time and is very hard to fix. It _does_ need to be fixed, but this is not a race against the current crop of exchange companies who'll be gone in a few years anyway. It is a race against huge swaths of the regulatory regimes in the world getting the idea in their heads that chainanalysis is useful or desireable, requiring some form of it to participate legally in the space, and thereby kill the fungibility and value of the system. And fortunately, regulatory bodies are very slow and cautious (for much the same reasons that developers of consensus systems are). Also fortunately, the _presence_ of privacy-focused altcoins in the space undermines that, no need for panicked Bitcoiners to risk their funds by using these things day-to-day.

&gt; I have been involved with bitcoin since 2012 and I feel really bad to see how they took over the project. It was suppose to fight their monopoly, now its part of their monopoly. it was suppose to be cypherpunk revolution but it turned out to be Total global finanacial surveillance system ran by institutional investors.
&gt;
&gt; What are the options left.. this is serious??

Bitcoin has been useful as a surveillance tool since its inception. This is not a new problem, but it is definitely not one that people have been ignoring. As improvements come out which don't have serious and consensus-preventing tradeoffs (Taproot will be one such thing, I think) you will see them deployed. Things will, and are, improving.

The amount of research going into this is tremendous, to the point that it's very hard to keep up with even for somebody actively working in this space. I keep half an eye on what's communicated to the public and I appreciate how slow and frustrating this looks, but behind the scenes it's anything but. When I got into this space I had a lot of ideas about new crypto that needed to be invented and how it would transform the privacy landscape of Bitcoin. Five years later we have (almost) practical technologies that are better than anything I _imagined_ back then.

Consider how potent [Taproot](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2018-January/015614.html) plus [Scriptless scripts](https://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-dev@lists.linuxfoundation.org/msg06840.html) are -- payment channels that are indistinguishable from ordinary transactions, are unlinkable even by different parties along the same path, offer [multipath payments](http://bitcoin-development.narkive.com/Pzj7wueQ/fwd-lightning-dev-amp-atomic-multi-path-payments-over-lightning) with transferrable proofs of payment, and are smaller and cheaper to verify than ordinary transactions today.

But translating this rapid rate of progress into consensus changes is hard. You don't get to iterate, so what gets deployed needs to be the best it can be. You need to get consensus, meaning you need to demonstrate no regressions in scalability, privacy, usability or security, all of which are multi-dimensional and any of which will stall a proposal. The proposal needs to be sound, because if it breaks the system then it's effectively game over, and beyond _being_ sound you have to _convince_ everyone that it's sound.

In particular, by the way, anything CT-based will introduce a scalability hit, though BPs largely eliminate this, and reduce the soundness of the system to the discrete-log problem.

Most of the trading is being done on existing coin, but there's 1800 BTC of new inventory daily. To sustain a price of $8000 the market must add $14.4m in new investment each day to match inflation.

Turn the math around and let's say you have the same level of investment but remove enough hash-power to temporarily drop the block rate to 4 per hour.  That means until difficulty readjusts, inflation is only 1200 BTC per day. $14.4m / 1200 = $12000.

"Hey bro, you have low karma on this sub. /s

1. Has already been tried with BTC and leads to a double blind auction resulting in chaotic transaction costs. I'm personally in favor of no blocksize limit.

2. Was the original intent of frictionless (or low friction) electronic cash.

The steady flow of income is already built into the halving algorithm. If a miner can't make profit when the reward is halved every 4 years you either see the price double shortly due market efficiency (1/2 the supply 2x the price if demand is =) or a culling of unprofitable miners (lowering the difficulty that rebalances the profit margin for new ones).

The blocksize has no influence over fees unless intentionally used to do so. It was originally used in the early days as a spam filter. Today it's too expensive to DDoS the mempool with low fee TX. The onus of protecting the mempool and block propagation is on the miners which is why we pay them to validate our TX.

If a smaller miner succeeds in getting multiple blocks he hit a statistical outlier and would be getting more profit; not less.

The fees are not meant to support *certain* miners. Those being the ones who can't efficiently produce blocks at an energy efficient level. What I'm not seeing you mention is the fact miners are actively competing for block fees. Those miners who can most efficiently produce blocks will do so more often. They can then lower the amount of fees necessary to remain profitable while increasing the TX throughput per block. From there the new miners coming online that just built a more efficient miner or developed a more effective hashing software overlay come onto the market and shove the fees lower causing the fees below the previous miners can bear (bare? beer?). The miners actively watch the mempool and know how available the fees are. Concomitantly users want as fast a TX as they can afford and the need for a 10 minute block will increase proportionally to the delay enforced by the difficulty growth hammering inefficient miners. Users pay to speed up validation.

If you look at the mathematics and economics you will find the miners are in a constant state of competitive growth. The large miners will be outdated due to the same Moores Law growth of hash/kwh that also allows larger blocksize. The miners are capitalists competing to produce the largest block for the lowest price determined by the Bell curve distribution of fees centered on 0 or what the market finds efficient. If the system isn't running fast enough for the market the bell curve shifts up until the rewards force new investment into the mining further securing the network against attack and moving fees back towards 0.

If you don't understand the economic impact of an inflationary currency please read some of the Austrian economic theory on the gold standard. What we see here is a direct link of currency to electrical energy through mining.

If you have any concrete arguments against the logic here please point them out as I could be missing something. I like slowly deflationary cryptos and so do most of the original bitcoiners (and Satoshi).",1524318140

True. But i think alot of the linked moves have more to do with bots than big whales. Since so many are linked to btc and btc to usd/t the bots can move btc to alt. Alt to usd/t. Usd/t to btc and level the market. A bot can do that 3-5times a second. Fund it with $500 and it can move 90k-150k a minute per coin (or 270-450k total volume per min) so any crazy spike in one coin quickly gets circled till its level. It looks like a whale buying 450k in a minute but realy its 1 bot making 10cents a circle.,1524316417

"The only way to trade in any market is to value invest.

In the late 90s, there was a tech boom.  Companies like red hat and pets.com had huge stock gains.  But, there came a day when they posted earnings yet again as a loss when investors panicked, realized they could go bankrupt, and we had a market crash.

The same happened with the housing market.  Housing prices were so hot, companies were giving loans to people with no income, no job, and no personal assets.  The momentum of the housing market kept prices climbing until it didn't.

TA is bullshit.  The behavior of people can be estimated, but with no degree of certainty.  However, value investors almost always win.  As an extreme example, if there were 50 homes in a neighborhood that sold for 300k, all the same same floor plan, but one was selling for 200k, would you be inclined to buy that house even if it had been on the market for over a year?  As long as nothing is wrong with it, you should, as it is selling for far less than its comparibles.

The 10 largest banks in the world all hold at or in excess of 2T.  Alll gold in the world has a net value of 9T.  My value analysis says bitcoin is comparable to a top 10 world bank if not gold.  It's future market cap should end up being between 2T and 9T.  You can rely on people being instantly rational, which is why the market moves so much.  But you can absolutely count on the market eventually reaching the appropriate equilibrium after many years.  This is why i hold and will never give up a single satoshi gambling on TA until we get in that value range.",1524315025

Fast forward to now and we're all carrying around our e-mails in our pocket. Cryptocurrencies have the potential to grow so that almost everyone will be using them. We may even have a future where people don't even realise they're using cryptocurrencies, it's become so engrained in the payment systems in apps etc.

Become an early adopter, like the rest of us, and see where that $50 is in five years time. The worst case is you've lost $50.

Bitcoin is only worth what people think it is, so the risk is that it's in fashion at the moment and in five years time it's gone the way of myspace and everyone's moved to facebook.

This is altcoiner mentality. They dont care if they buy stuff in USD or oil notes. They are in this for profit. Since crypto is a 0 sum game(until adoption), its about not being the greater fool. Timing the market so someone else is left with something less valuable and you can scoop that up for cheap.

BTC (and maybe ETH) is different. Bitcoiners dont care about price, they want to spend BTC at taco bell, they want to never use fiat again. They hate inflationary currency controlled by a central entity.

It allows people in China to send money person-to-person or person-to-business without requiring their banking information.

Thermis could not possibly offer anything similar.  Firstly, the Chinese banks will never agree to work with this type of company.  Secondly, China in general has cracked down in a huge way on crypto.  So there's absolutely no way these Thermis guys could offer an onboarding solution for fiat users.

Instead what I understand is that they offer an escrow service for crypto payments.  Of course, this would almost definitely be best offered using an existing blockchain, but they've tried to explain why you need to add a whole new blockchain into this business model.  The reason?

&gt; Lightning is closer to IOU's than 0-conf because they are unbroadcast transactions. They're effectively digital IOU's - the action of broadcasting (i.e. closing the channel) is the action of redeeming it. Remember that physical dollars are actually IOU's, too - the action of spending a dollar is the action of redeeming the debt it represents.

However lightning 'IOUs' are cryptographically secured and are 100% redeemable (unless the other party cheats and you fail to notice or if your transaction some how gets censored off) and unlike fiat it isn't empty promise with no guarantee.

&gt;     The whole reason banks enjoy enormous power, is because they have custodial control of everyone’s funds, and customers have no way to enforce the agreement with the bank.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Wrong. The whole reason banks enjoy enormous power is because they have custodial control of funds and can use them as collateral for loans. When you can explain why a financial service that shares control of large sums of consumer funds in Lightning channels cannot use that shared control of funds as collateral for a loan, then your argument will have merit.

In lightning network third parties don't have custodian control of funds. If a node misbehaves you can force close the channel if you have a direct channel with them or you can route your payments through other nodes if it's an intermediate node.

If a financial service some how managed to get/give a loan with the user funds in channels as collateral then what happens when it defaults? It can't take away user funds. Also what would the 'loan' be? It can't be LN funds or on chain bitcoins in a trustless way. (I am not familiar with bank stuff and I am acknowledging I could be wrong in understanding what you said).

What you are saying applies to custodian services like Coinbase and other exchanges. If banks what to control bitcoin it would be easier to open a service like Coinbase and do the traditional banking stuff. Remember that Mt Gox was on fractional reserve for years.

&gt;     The lightning protocol fully neuters them from any kind of fractional reserve
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; NO. IT. DOES. NOT. Cooperative participants can reserve (and thus, fractionally reserve) against any asset they want to. If a lender will accept an unpublished song script as collateral, than that unpublished song is reserved into debt. If the lender offers five times the perceived price of that song, then the song is fractionally reserved.

I don't understand your argument here.

That's not a requirement. That's how BTC (and other blockchains) function. It's willful and purposeful. It's nothing new. The basics of the protocol have been around for almost a decade. It's **always** been that if you revealed your address, someone could trace all your transactions. It's not new. If you've thought otherwise, you've been technologically under informed. 

&gt; Otherwise every company that fails to meet GDPR could use the same excuse

Exchanges keep meticulous records for you so most of it is already done, it's just necessary to get the coin/fiat exchange rate for each day that you trade.

I understand that all usage could be viewed as good usage, but I'm not convinced. A block chain is an incredibly inefficient data storage, and in my opinion it's use case needs to be much more focused than simply writing all and every kind of data onto it. BTC is doing the exact opposite by trying to make individual transactions as small/efficient as possible in terms of storage size.

One of the founding principals of cryptocurrency is that you can anonymously make transactions from one party to another. Giving a TxId to a random stranger online seems like something that should be prevented considering that principal. The TxId can lead to a stranger checking out your address and its balance. If you have an anonymous account online which cannot be traced back to your personal life it will still be relatively safe. However you never know what kind of people can be looking at your address or your online account. Remember at its best bitcoin only offers Pseudonymity.

"&gt; Technical analysis is bullshit.

Don't be result oriented. But yes, to me it seems the vast majority of TA people are bearish. 


Most claimed we will re-test lower levels. I just happen to disagree on the basis that Crypto is not really your average stock and the asset performs differently. It's at 8000$ for a reason, that's because it usually moved up over time and held a new key value. 



Heart is super salty about himself right now it seems. He originally called that you can 2x trade Bitcoin, because it never loses more than 50%. He was wrong. Then he claimed all these ludicrious things about how there's no support left and all that shit. Price got to his head. 



Tone is a tool, that's all you need to know. 



TA is bullshit, but very popular in times like these, when we go sideways and go through re-test of older lower levels, nothing happens, so people look for indicators saying whether it's moving anytime soon or not. 


I'm a fan of simple logic when doing TA. We're still under 200 day, confidence is low, thus volume and interest are also low. We couldn't hold that level before, and hopefulyl we can this time around. RSI on daily indicates we're still not overbought.

My backstory is that I sorta missed the crypto boat... I very nearly took the plunge when BTC was hovering around 3000 USD (March or April last year, from memory) but, alas, I didn't have the balls to pull the trigger.

As a result, for about a year now I have had major crypto fomo. I finally bit the bullet and bought some monero a couple of months back, and (at least on paper) have made a bit of money out of it, but I still can't shake the feeling that I should have been more aggressive sooner... 

But anyway, despite not having the holdings a lot of people on /r/cryptocurrency have, I've been pretty badly bitten by the crypto bug. I'm still a pretty risk averse guy by nature... I'll continue to buy small amounts, but I don't think I'll ever get to the point where I'll be comfortable enough to 'bet big' on crypto. 

The purpose of this game is to help me learn to trade in a 'safe space' as well as hopefully combatting my not inconsiderable amount of crypto related FOMO.

If you're going to keep it in cold storage for several _months_, then you'd be better off storing in on a respected exchange and swing trade a pair that you're interested in.

"You seem to have a decent view of the market, but for me it's hard to follow your predictions and conclusions. I'm just a layman trying to understand the field of crypto a bit better. Would you mind explaining a few parts of your post?

&gt; Bitcoin made several attempts to push lower, but these attempts failed to attract any longer term selling. They were in effect just margin stop runs that failed to continue.

Do you mean Bitcoin as an institution? Who exactly made these attempts? What does ""push lower"" mean in this context, and why would they want that? 

&gt; That means that in order to push lower the market must attract new buyers that will sell when Bitcoin decides to start its next move down.

What will that next move be in your opinion?

&gt; Why am I so sure that it's a bull trap and not just an influx of new investors that could start a new bull run? The answer lies in on chain transaction value. Bitcoin use and adoption has decreased substantially. This is readily apparent in looking at on chain transaction value. 

How do you see that? To you it seems apparent, but to me this sounds like magic. Where can we actually see the on chain transaction value, and how do we draw conclusions from that? 

&gt; When we look at the history of on chain transaction value compared to price we quickly see that Bitcoin is already overvalued.  At $9500 we would be reading the most overvalued levels Bitcoin has ever had indicating an imminent crash. The last time I saw things at this level was before the December crash.

What value _should_ Bitcoin have if we look at those transactions, leaving you to conclude that the current value is overvalued?

And regarding maximalism, I've read it has ""BCH blockchain is only for monetary transactions"" kind of maximalism.

"My objections are both on Bitpay and BIP70.

BIP70 fixes screwups of BTC and is not needed on BCH.  The refund aspect can me achieved with other (non-mandatory) BIP’s like 47.

Bitpay uses arguments for making it mandatory which do not apply to BCH and they lie when they tell you it’s because of their support being swamped. Their support gets swamped again when BTC fees rise and users can’t use their service. 

It also sets precedent that a company with a monopoly can force changes on the community, it’s not healthy. 

There are a lot of reasons to be against it and I commented for weeks on it, I’m not going to retype it all again. Use the search bar.",1524300922

copied from the BIP https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0070.mediawiki

The current, minimal Bitcoin payment protocol operates as follows:

Customer adds items to an online shopping basket, and decides to pay using Bitcoin.Merchant generates a unique payment address, associates it with the customer's order, and asks the customer to pay.Customer copies the Bitcoin address from the merchant's web page and pastes it into whatever wallet they are using OR follows a bitcoin: link and their wallet is launched with the amount to be paid.Customer authorizes payment to the merchant's address and broadcasts the transaction through the Bitcoin p2p network.Merchant's server detects payment and after sufficient transaction confirmations considers the transaction final.This BIP extends the above protocol to support several new features:

Human-readable, secure payment destinations-- customers will be asked to authorize payment to ""example.com"" instead of an inscrutable, 34-character bitcoin address.Secure proof of payment, which the customer can use in case of a dispute with the merchant.Resistance from man-in-the-middle attacks that replace a merchant's bitcoin address with an attacker's address before a transaction is authorized with a hardware wallet.Payment received messages, so the customer knows immediately that the merchant has received, and has processed (or is processing) their payment.Refund addresses, automatically given to the merchant by the customer's wallet software, so merchants do not have to contact customers before refunding overpayments or orders that cannot be fulfilled for some reason.",1524300869

"Thanks, your objections seem to be more against Bitpay than BIP70... 

Steppibg away from Bitpay, the general idea of the protocol seems ok, I have done quite a lot of eCommerce projects and as long as you have 4 or 5 clients per day it doesn't get complicated but even with only 20 transactions per day it becones time-consuming to keep things managed (returns, cancelled orders, etc). BIP70 seems to be helpful in that aspect, also for a customer it will be helpful to have a clear text payment request instead of a BCH address....

Ona side note: You mentioned in your comments that merchants focus on fiat... you can't blame them for that, these people/businesses purchase their stock in fiat, pay salaries in fiat, etc all in fiat... don't expect them to lead the transition from fiat to crypto... they probably will be one of the first to follow after a tipping point.....

"Yep, you're not the only one with regrets.

In 2010 I was playing a lot of World of Warcraft, and a few of the people I was playing with at the time were really into mining bitcoin, talking about it after every raid night about how they ""just hit a block!"" etc. I heard them talking about it and was curious, thought the concept sounded cool. I even asked one of the guys if he could show me how it works and help me set up a wallet to receive a few. Unfortunately he didn't, I think he was tired at the time and couldn't be bothered.

I had a great gaming PC at the time with a quad core CPU too, they were apparently great for mining it at the time. It was like I had the perfect conditions right in front of me to get in on this thing early.

I don't remember why I didn't end up looking into it more myself and doing it, I think the idea that it was very resource intensive and I'd either have to sacrifice my gaming time or have to leave my computer on running loudly overnight may have turned me off it.

The kicker? I even have my fully intact hard drive from my 2010 PC sitting on a shelf behind me, ""just in case"" I needed to get anything off it one day.

Word to the wise... when ppl start saying something (especially like BCH in the top 5 in market cap) is dying or dead... buy. A top 5 crypto asset isn’t going to die because some trolls on reddit said so.

BTFD. ",1524299182
I don't know about this - I'd much rather the BCH be put to good use - or possibly donated to charity or to the bitcoin cash fund.

"**Cyphernomicon**

""The Cyphernomicon"" is a document written by Timothy C. May in 1994 for the Cypherpunks electronic mailing list, outlining some ideas behind, and the effects of, crypto-anarchism. It constitutes one of the philosophy's founding documents, advocating anonymous digital currency and electronic privacy, and touching on more esoteric topics, such as assassination markets.

The document is written and formatted as a lengthy FAQ. It contains many short notes on ideas, questions and claims ordered in sections. It also contains May's 1992 essay ""The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto"", in section 16.4.2.

"yes, the wallet functionality right now is limited to only opening channels and making payments. To receive payments you need to run a LN node.

You will have the full functionality once it hits v1, but right now they rushed a beta and it is on version 0.2 because people were starting to run nodes on main net despite the main dev team advising contrary.

And there are still many improvements to do on the LN main code before being able to release a really stable and ready to use massively version. That being said, what we have right now is usable and has a lot of merit. 

Sure it is cumbersome to setup, but pretty much all new technology is. I still remember the early days of bitcoin, you had to run a full node in order to be able to use it.

"Fair enough that you've never seen porn included in that list so let's take it on its own and ignore illegal goods. This isn't FUD either, just because porn is legal doesn't make it more paletable for the average person. It adds to the overall appearance of crypto as being a payment method for illicit (not necessarily illegal) goods. Ultimately, for mass adoption, we probably need stuff to appear squeaky clean at first and then move to things like porn and gambling. As another example I'd include gambling in this too as it's not particularly wholesome to the general public but is legal and widely available. This isn't meant as FUD at all, take it as that if you wish but it's made out of a consideration that I want crypto to succeed as an asset class. I can accept that this partnership *is* adoption but is it what crypto needs as the face of adoption. In my opinion only I'm not sure it is. That's all.

 When California's bitlicense was proposed in February 2015 for the first time, there was huge uproar and outrage in many areas, and it wasn't hard to organize against it; by the time we took down the third attempt at a California bitlicense (fortunately the latest CA bitlicense attempt went down in flames in January 2018) there was such apathy in crypto communities it was hard to even get people to recognize that it had been defeated a third time.

"&gt; i hope that doing so brought you some joy while you were doing it at least

Yes, it brought me joy that people would be able to trade without being imprisoned for what people know that everybody does all the time.

&gt; at least. bitcoin doesnt care about government man

Bitcoin is not a conscious thing, it is a protocol, and so how could it possibly ""care"" about anything, including about what you say?  However, an individual person using bitcoin might care if they went to prison for using it.  Think about what you are saying.

&gt; the people that already have bitcoin dont really need to worry about what exchange they are going to use to get more

Wrong again.  Read above.

&gt;  government can get fucked, it needs to be defunded.

I'm not a fan of government either.  I don't think that growing the (U.S. federal budget as an example) into trillions and leaving the (economic and political) system in a state of wreckage, which is the fault of the past several Congresses and Presidential administrations (there is no one particular one to lay the blame on here) is fair to the next generation or to us for that matter.

But that's beside the point. It exists and one cannot deny its negative effects from certain specific activities it engages in.  State governments have become more predatory as of late.  To deny this is foolhardy.  If we want to be free of them it behooves us also to deny them the opportunity to successfully pass laws that would cause grief for people in the first place.

&gt; the point it that it doesnt really matter.

No, the point is that you are apathetic and you have taken zero responsibility for this subject, which will continue to be a salient issue for bitcoin users.  If you are sincere in wanting people to be able to use bitcoin without impediment, you would be more of an advocate directly to and against legislatures that have proposed bitlicense, and you would likely also be advocating for better self-regulation by exchanges and services.

"&gt;However you finally agree that the effect of burning is to raise price. Thank you.

I actually do not (it has no to slightly positive/zero fiat price effect). This for now when adoption is minimal. The actual effect of burning is deflationary. Imagine a world where only BCH is used, the world we are all working to move to. How does BCH's price increase by burning BCH? In the long term it decreases everyone's holdings in bch, salaries in bch go down, prices in bch go down, hodlers increase because they see prices going down and they postpone big expenses hoping for prices to go even lower. It stops the money from exchanging hands. It turns people into hodlers. hodlers exist in btc but in fiat economies too, if the economy is deflationary.  

&gt;It's less than a dollar a block. C'mon.

it would be massive if they went in the streets of rural china giving everyone 50 cents for free. I heard they burn $10 per day, that would make 20 people per day. 600 people per month. And the network effect of 600 people per month, and if bitmain also opens a bar in that village where they sell tea for 10 cents a cup so people can go spent their bch to buy tea, and then another shop starts offering clothes. And then people start exchanging bch among themselves. You create a new bch economy from the ground up starting with only $10 per day. And then word spreads in the nearby village and the one next to it and so on. 

imagine the impact something like this would have, on communities, on society but also on hodlers. if this spread in all china and africa etc. bch's price would grow exponentially. Compare this to the impact of burning $10 per day on bch's fiat price, doesn't it strike you as extremely counterproductive to burn coins at this point? That's why the opportunity cost is immense. You are sacrificing the opportunity to trigger massive adoption for some nonsensical ""let's help hodlers"" campaign that doesn't even help hodlers but only makes you look good on facebook. I think Bitmain has an inferiority complex they are trying hard to be loved and ended up doing a blunder instead.",1524295213

Throughout the whole Crypto journey, i actually learned tons of security measurements like 2FA (Which infact i started to use after my wallet got emptied)

1) Hardware wallet is connected to PC, PC is connected to Network. As long as i am the only holder of the Priv key, regardless if the PC is **infected with tons of malware**, i am **connecting to a Public Wifi which steals information**,  Can i assume that i will be safe from all these threats?

* Connecting to a Public Wifi might be potential to go through the Authentication Code?
