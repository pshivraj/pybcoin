"There's nothing preventing bitcoin from becoming inflationary after all coins have been mined.

Personally, I think the idea of having an ""ultimate currency of the future"" is a bit silly, and at least antithetical to the rise of [cryptoanarchy](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/crypto/cypherpunks/cyphernomicon/CP-FAQ) (see section 16.4.2 for a short manifesto).

If the long term fundamentals haven‚Äôt changed i.e. crypto‚Äôs future is just as bright as it once was, then all the (completely valid) problems you listed are precisely why crypto is still such a big opportunity.

It won‚Äôt happen overnight, we will surely have setbacks, but the reason this is a big opportunity is precisely because it will take a while and it‚Äôs still in the early days of crypto.

"&gt; what are the most signicant diference between BTC and BCH in your opinion.

The most significant difference between them is BCH's intentional use of a consensus formed by a minority work capacity. The difference in DAA is not particularly significant from a technology perspective - had BCH's (new) DAA been the original bitcoin difficult schedule it would be unremarkable. _The act of making the change_ is *very* significant, as it was done with the intent of protecting a minority fork.

The minority is absolutely free to run a fork. However, in my opinion, it runs counter to the intent of bitcoin to accept less than majority consensus and changes made specifically to support that are therefore unnecessary at best, and potentially detrimental.",1526453085

So they're playing by all the regulatory books and will basically get regulatory approval for what they're doing and provide actual regular audits.

For what it's worth I actually think Tether has all it's supposed reserves (there's just too much money to be made in crypto for them not to-look at how much money every crypto exchange made last year) but the fact that they can't actually provide audits because they're playing a shell game with their bank accounts keeps people worried about it, and the fact that they're playing a shell game with governments and regulators also means there's a risk that some government seizes all their money.

"LOL are you for real man? I could see where you were headed with all your comments promoting that podcast but using accusations that have been discussed and debunked countless times, is really getting tiring.

Ripple cannot themselves freeze anyones assets, go google what happened with Jed, the contract, and who actually froze. Google this man, 20.000 sources will show you as a fact that that is blatant misinformation you are spreading. 

Personally I would love to have the ability to freeze anything suspicious but sadly it is not there, even though I want it.

What crypto stands for? what crypto stands for is not just what's defined by btc maximalists, Blockchain is here to stay and will solve many problems and it wont just be XRP either. 

Crypto was never made to combat banks, we need banks for loans and insurances and various other things. If it's not the banks you will end up in the hands of the 4% japanese guys who own majority of btc anyways and at the mercy of mining operators siphoning all your cash out to fiat giving you a token you so blindly fight for. 

Blockchain was a great concept introduced and cuddos to btc, for appreciation and being first I always will keep my few and put on paper even if all nodes cease to exist, but I am a realist and true innovation will come from innovating within the society norms and systems that work for us, providing us with first world lives and welfare we so enjoy. 

Lets not get into ideologies here, I get why you hate XRP and why you promoting that podcast, its usecase is not only banks. Wait and see how that expands.

It is true that it would have been great if Ripple was only gifted a small amount not 60% of xrp but it is what it is, and it is the fastest most scalable crypto out there. consensus always starts centralised, but is a beast compared to POW and will ultimately be more decentralised than btc and eth both with just 17 more nodes, hell probably less now. 

Want to learn more, look into the academics who have done analysis in XRP at MIT and the Italy uni, I can share links if you like?

"&gt;I have said before and I have said it again, Bitcoin mining PoW is not a Capitalist system because the miners are workers and they get rewarded 100% of their work they put in into mining. It means the miner gets 100% reward for its productivity of mining Bitcoin. Capitalist system only rewards you a small portion of your productivity and is not what is happening with Bitcoin mining PoW system... so anyone that says that Bitcoin is Capitalist system, is simply wrong.

Why would you be paid for 100% of the value you have created, when you didn‚Äôt provide the tool, the material for the job, you didn‚Äôt take the financial risk, pay the marketing cost?

You can only get 100% if you cover all those cost yourself, obviously (being independent).

In a competitive market nobody can exploit you, because if you are underpaid for your productivity, another company will offer you more money for the same job.

Market let free adjust quickly to that.

The problem is nowadays it is the law meant to protect employees that have distorted the game.

"To preface everything I say, I'm from Denmark, and this is my danish perspective on things. I am subscribed to /r/legaladvice and know how fucked up some things are in the US. But just because it's fucked up in the US, doesn't mean that governmen is a bad thing. It just means that the government in the US needs changes. 

&gt;1) I said what governments do. Not the reasons we have them. Read any history. Governments are the most evil institutions in the history of Earth.

As someone who lives in Denmark is have the complete 180 view on this.. I love the way our government works, and i legitimately think they are purely here to make my life easier and because of that i have less worries in my life. Everything is taken care of. 

I know that I havn't lived it, i'm only in my mid twenties. But I do know several people working in banks and even for our govermental tax firm, and having heard lots of stories that are both good and bad, nothing comes close to being *that* bad. And this might be a danish-only thing, i would have no idea. 

&gt;2) Banks make mistakes and freeze people's accounts

I actually checked for this, and, again in Denmark, the absolute *only* way an account can be frozen is with a warrant, which is not easy to get. So I don't know someone at a bank would be able to make the mistake of freezing an account. And even if they did, you can just call them and they'll have it unfrozen instantly. 

&gt;3) right now to have a savings account in Switzerland you have to PAY to keep your money in the bank

Again, this sounds really weird - but there must be a logical reason for this? And regarding your edit, yes here in Denmark we have to pay a very small fee, about 8-16 USD for any account. There have been cases with negative rates, but very minor, i personally am getting up to 5% earnings on my savings account - which is quite a lot of money in the long run. 

&gt;4) You kindly ignored my statements on Cyprus and Greece when the ATMs all closed for weeks

Not much to say, I did read about it in the news, and it's obviously a fucked up situation - no doubt Bitcoin would have been really handy.

&gt;If you seriously think government is this wonderful thing you've not read the news, not read history and are keeping your eyes closed.

I'm not going to argue that all governments are working for the good of the people. I think the government in the US, and several other big countires are corrupt to the bone, and are working mainly for selfish reasons. But then again, that's part of living the American dream? Everyone wants to achieve the most for themselves? The problem I see with your point of view, is that - yes - governments can be bad and not working as intended, but the reason we should work to make it better is to make our own and others' lives easier. 

&gt;Why are you even into Bitcoin? Bitcoin is the best invention of my lifetime. Bitcoin gives power fo the people. Takes power away from the mega rich and well connected. Takes power away from governments. That's a good thing.


Why am I into Bitcoin? Aside from the mining, I really love the idea of decentralized currencies, and I especially love blockchain technology. It's honestly, as I assume you would agree, one of the stronger tools invented in the last many years and the potential is incredible. I do like government, but to be fair my government probably works slightly better than many others, it still has issues, but overall I'm very happy with it. That doesn't mean I also love banks. If I didn't have to use a bank, I probably wouldn't. And by people being more hands-on with their own money I do think less people will be economically illiterate, which would be a good thing. If you think that the way to give people power is by using Bitcoin, then that's totally perfect - but I personally see Bitcoin as a means of trying to limit the symptoms, instead of curing the disease.

"I never said ""I want"" Goldman Sachs.  I was just pointing out the objective truth.

Like it or not, reality is that the market prefers fiat trading pairs.  In major exchanges that offer fiat trading pairs (GDAX, BitStamp, etc) the fiat trading pairs dominate.  There is clear market demand for fiat priced trading.  

However, many exchanges do not have real fiat trading pairs, and offer Tether pairs instead.  But with Tether, everyone is basically holding their breath, and wondering if/when Bitfinex &amp; Tether will just disappear.

No crypto trader ""invests"" in USD, USDT, or USDC.  They are simply using it as a trading pair. 

If Goldman Sachs &amp; Circle introduces USDC, many people will use it as a trading pair, especially the ones who have concerns that virtual entities like Bitfinex &amp; Tether are setup to exit scam into thin air.  

If USDT &amp; USDC are both worth $1, many traders will favor USDC simply because it is less likely to suddenly vanish into a ""penis"" exit page.  Even if USDC blows up, you have a big solid entity that you can sue.  You know where their headquarters are, you have their audited financials, they aren't going anywhere.

"I have the same problem with my portfolio currently and i would really appreciate if you guys could offer your insight in this matter. 

If you look at it from market psychology perspective, from the broader view all the way down to average investors \(such as me and you\), this kind of market behaviour for the last 5 months now is exactly what is causing people to jump the ship, some earlier, more optimistic people further down the road, some more optimistic spikes, with some optimistic time periods, but with a rather clear bearish trend, eventually depressing markets to the very bottom, it has a cumulative bearish efect.  

That is also the reason why i have mixed feelings about Gartner hype cycle again playing itself out quite similarly as how it did back in the end of 2013 throughout 2014\-2016. People and markets do not really change. Yes there are certainly stronger fundamentals as there were back in 2013, also different fundamental reason for the correction, but over all, it all comes down to the very same reason, people lose trust and therefore selling \&gt; buying.

There are always possibility for black swan event, both negative and positive. 

In current market size, it takes significant amount of inflow of money for the markets to change the sentiment. Retail average Joe currently has lost/is losing faith. The way i \(and also probably most others\) see this is what might pull market back up is for example bigger institutions buying in larger blocks, which would restore retail investor sentiment back to bullish. There is also hope for some less likely event, such as China or India taking more positive sentiment on crypto. 

I am rambling, sorry for this, to conclude, what i was trying to say is that part of be believes, that market psychology over all never really changes \(either it is 3d printing hype, tulips or soybeans\), and therefore current situation might very likely mimic something very similar as to what happened back in 2013\-2016, meaning that total market cap bottoms out perhaps somewhere around 160B. So far it has done just that. Other part of me thinks, that there are still significant amount of possible catalysts, to either stop the bleeding the least or perhaps even enough to make 180 return back to bullish movements of over all market.   

There is also always option, that although over all markets stay in bearish sentiment for 1.5 more years, my particular projects with hopefully strong fundamental results and fiat pairing, are perhaps able to crack strong correlation with other market participants. 

I believe statistically perhaps best approach would be either continue my DCA or liquidate half of portfolio to fiat, therefore hedging against both bullish and bearish market outcome. Hmm...",1526451693

"Fiat will become much more attractive, but Bitcoin and crypto still has some advantages (for now).  

Try driving across the country with $5000 of crypto on you.  It is not likely, but it is very possible that the police can stop you for a traffic violation and steal your money.  With Bitcoin, this is much less likely if you have your shit encrypted.

Or of course you can put all your money in the bank and trust the Banks and the US gov't not to arbitrarily take some of it, because they can.  Again, there is low risk of that happening, but significant risk.

Of course there is also significant risk of being hacked and having your cryptocurrency stolen.  So no perfect solution, but fiat is not a home run winner in all cases yet.

"Back then it hadn't achieved the same level of worldwide recognition that it did in 2017. In 2017 the media hyped it up literally every single day for over a month straight. Sure, 2013 had a bit of media attention but not nearly as much as 2017 did. It has been established that crypto and blockchain is here to stay. And that is backed up by the fact that it is being more and more established as legitimate by governments and powerful individuals. 


George Soros is thinking of getting into. NASDAQ is thinking of listing it. It is traded on official futures markets and may be traded on wall street soon. Companies are starting to implement blockchain, states like Wyoming and Arizona are passing crypto-friendly laws, the government is having constant meetings on it. There's simply too much to ignore.


Things are different. ",1526451488
"The explaination is just unnecessairly complicated. Bitcoin and such use cryptography so only one key access funds in one address. This works because private key -&gt; hash -&gt; hash needed to transfer bitcoin but """" -&gt; hash -&gt; not the private key. It only works one way.

Bank maybe use that too but it has nothing to do with transfers. They do all that by themselves.",1526451385

"I posted this four days ago and want to re-iterate for those who are thinking about buying in at these prices.

Long term fundamentals are still in a place where nothing has changed in the last 18 months.

Security is still crap.

Cryptos are still not user friendly.

Cryptos are still VERY difficult to purchase for the average investor.

Merchants integration and general adoption of cryptos is still crap.

Google search trends for various crypto products are back down at what they were this time last year.

Do people still think cryptos are worth paying 10x-100x premium on something that hasn't had any tangible improvement in the last 12 months.

Ask yourself, if cryptos disappeared tomorrow would it fundamentally change anything for the average person who isn't speculating on them.

Also ask yourself, how many people are still left in crypto who aren't planning to dump as soon as the price goes higher.

The only thing we have achieved in the last year is bringing in large scale market manipulators from the mainstream market. Professional traders and shorters have come into this crypto space and these guys don't give a fuck what the price is doing, up or down they win. Most of you are bringing a knife to a gun fight unless you are buying in at super lows.",1526451041

"Someone posted a website a few days ago, where you could easily compare two cryptos performances percentage-wise over a given time period. I might be doing something wrong, but I haven‚Äôt been able to achieve this with tradingview.

I wanted to compare how, lets say, BTC is fairing against other cyrotos in their up and downswings, and which ones have been retaining/losing the most value at the end of these pump and dump cycles we frequently experience across the crypto market.

Side question - Is Binance a good exchange for parking my Botcoin in USDT or any other stable currency during obvious downtrends? I really wanted to park it for a bit (not cash out, due to ridiculous withdrawal fees) when it reached 8700, but was unsure about the specifics. Are there any significant fees associated with these types of transactions (moving to USDT and back)? I‚Äôm thinking of either diversifying a bit or familiarize myself with tethering while the market shows signs of weakness.

Any/all opinions greatly appreciated.

Thanks!",1526450778

"It's not competition lol.  If you think any average person will ever use something designed for dinosaur banks, the exact thing Crypto was originally made to combat then I dunno what to say.  XRP is centralized plain and simple, it is owned by a private company, many by default settings make it centralized including the ability to freeze assets.

Not only does Ripple encourage the XRP of suspicious accounts to be frozen, but ‚ÄúThe financial institution should also freeze the counterparty in any other systems the financial institution operates that are connected to the XRP Ledger‚Äù. Your bitcoin; your litecoin; your euros; anything connected to a Ripple gateway can be locked down. No other cryptocurrency has a similar framework in place, which grants exchanges unprecedented powers to lock up funds at the drop of a hat.

When a private company (RIPPLE) can ""freeze individual accounts issuances in order to investigate suspicious activity‚Äù this is the definition of centralization. This power is not given in any other crypto - literally! What happens if a country were to outlaw XRP? Do you think Ripple would fight it...seriously?

Owning XRP in a country that is hostile to cryptocurrency; possessing an unusually large amount of XRP; signing up to a Ripple gateway exchange from a banned country: all could be grounds for freezing your account.",1526449846
As I said in other replies to this post I would think that a small business just wants to focus on the business and would accept bitcoin because it saves them money vs visa‚Äôs cut when people use cards. They can‚Äôt use the bitcoin to purchase supplies or pay employees. And they want to accept it to entice people that otherwise wouldn‚Äôt go there because crypto people like to support crypto businesses. In my mind it seems useless for a small business to hold onto them because of the risk of losing money. ,1526449820

Each time those coin moves the paranoia is gonna play out and the price is gonna come tumbling down for BTC, and as every fucking alt follows BTC every thing is gonna crash time and again.

"Never ask somebody else for a ""favorite"" wallet. It's useless.  
Each wallet has his own features, functionalities that can fit each person needs. Each person should try as many as they can and dedicate each wallet for a specific use.  
There is also the option to use a wallet into 2 apps (mobile*/desktop or mobile/mobile, desktop/desktop). Having stuck your coins into a single wallet is dumb.  

[And here is a list of wallets](https://www.cryptocompare.com/wallets/#/overview)  
Remember [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F12lpqnug-0) so choose wisely your wallet, this is the only one important thing that make difference between wallets.  
Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly (don't watch too much porn with the same pc you are dealing with btc, or don't play those stupid mobile games on the same mobile you have a btc wallet)  
Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc  
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.  
Steganography wallets = insanity, paranoia about security :)

"&gt;&amp;gt; But are segwit a significant change for example?

&gt;By what measure? Segwit is a significant change in terms of modification to the code base, absolutely. It _is not_ a significant change to the conceptual model of coins-as-a-chain-of-digital-signatures. It is _far less_ of a change than Satoshi's implementation of programmable predicates vs the direct-signature model presented in the whitepaper.

I see a big change form the white paper here but I agree the signature data moved away from blocks (ANYONECANSPEND trick) doesn‚Äôt fundamentally change the currency nature.


&gt;Is Segwit a significant enough change that it should be closely examined? _No question!_ Having performed that examination, is it so drastic a change that it justifies forking if the majority consensus approves it? Not at all, in my opinion, but the minority is free to do so if they choose.

The way segwit provoke a significant change that justify forking is the way fee are handled and the way it was implemented IMO.

With segwit fee are not paid by Kb but per unit of weight.

This calculation hugely favor large transactions, reducing onchain scaling capabilities significantly.

Segwit make sense in a small block philosophy, it doesn‚Äôt it a large block philosophy.

Once segwit is implemented onchain scaling get much harder.

The second point is the way it has been implemented.

Via soft fork.. I think **no** economics change to the protocol (fee calculation) should ever be implemented as soft fork.. it gives way too mich power to miner. All significant economics change should only be made via HF, so one can be sure the whole community, coder, node, business, miner are in agreement with the changes.

The segwit got finally implemented is .. scary to say the least (miner got the bait at activating segwit by being offered 2MB after months of very miner vote)

Nobody the economics features of a currency to be handled that way ober the long term.

&gt;I'm only being defensive of my time spent in this discussion. It doesn't appear as though we're making much progress toward a mutual understanding. 

We don‚Äôt have to agree to discuss, I try to understand your pount of view. You don‚Äôt have to continue discussing if you don‚Äôt feel like it.

I am just surprised you seem unable to give your opinion on what is, after all, a simple question. Like it is somehow taboo or risky.

I gave you my opinion on everything you asked.

&gt;While I'm more than happy to answer questions, it's not as if I'm some defender of BTC or the Core implementation. You've presented things time and again as a contrast of BTC and BCH. _Both have made changes, neither is automatically more justified than the other, they must stand on their own merits, and both have the potential to be wrong._ 

I agree they both made changes but not all change are equal, obviously.

My question was just as simple as that: what are the most signicant diference between BTC and BCH in your opinion.

You told me you‚Äôve have been in cryptocurrencies for a long time, you should have an opinion on that.",1526449292

"First of all, it is ""whack a mole"" with the foreign exchanges that don't require AML/KYC.  These have already dropped in number a great deal and I'm sure the goal is to eradicate them completely.

But it's bad if you can't spend Bitcoin in the USA without giving someone your SSN# and DL and selfie pic.  That is bad.  Bad for adoption and bad for usage as a currency and means of payment.

And of course a huge selling point of Bitcoin from the start was to control your own money and have some financial privacy.  The privacy part was a ""killer app"" and it's going to be eradicated even further, although that part is already pretty much done with them coming down on Localbitcoins and all the USA exchanges and OTC sellers.

It's the same thing as a block increase, it always for more transactions. In fact, it's better because it makes the chain more efficient and fixes transaction malleability.

So **dude**, I don't understand what the issue is? Bitcoin hit the ceiling at 1 Mb, but now we have headroom up to 2 - 4 Mb.  Why is that a problem? This buys plenty of headroom for the moment. Schnorr will help too. Beyond that, a HF limit increase will be required at some point but should be cautiously implemented as a last priority.

Reality is that Capitalism is an exploitative type of Economic System In this video I explain why. Anyone that still thinks that Capitalism is great and shit, is either on the side of receiving end (being a Capitalist themselves) or is still in a good paying job, so they have not yet felt the harsh reality of this system as many other people have.

I have said before and I have said it again, Bitcoin mining PoW is not a Capitalist system because the miners are workers and they get rewarded 100% of their work they put in into mining. It means the miner gets 100% reward for its productivity of mining Bitcoin. Capitalist system only rewards you a small portion of your productivity and is not what is happening with Bitcoin mining PoW system... so anyone that says that Bitcoin is Capitalist system, is simply wrong.

Further more, as I said, only the each individual mining farm / pool can be either of 3, it can be Capitalist, it can be State Capitalist and it can be Communist type business, depending who runs and who owns each individual mining farm / pool... but the overall mining PoW system is not a Capitalist one, it is Communist one.

32 MB is as far as the blockchain can go ""for free."" To go further, we need deeper protocol changes. This is where most of the research &amp; engineering effort is going right now. In the short term, these same protocol changes also improve the security of 0-conf payments. The goal is to get one of the four proposals implemented, tested, and deployed long before the next block-size increase, which we will probably need in about 3-4 years if current growth rates hold.

The United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC, also called the FISA Court) is a U.S. federal court established and authorized under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA) to oversee requests for surveillance warrants against foreign spies inside the United States by federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Such requests are made most often by the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Congress created FISA and its court as a result of the recommendations by the U.S. Senate's Church Committee. In 2013, The New York Times said ""it has quietly become almost a parallel Supreme Court.""

From its opening in 1978 until 2009, the court was housed on the sixth floor of the Robert F. Kennedy Department of Justice Building.

Agree, latency makes sense. As well as package loss. There are many parameters, you cannot pull out of context only one. It depends on your geographical location (simply because light in wires must cross all the long way), as well it depends from network devices on the path (more devices, more routings, bigger latency).

I have 1 Gbit/s connection at work and home. I live in country, which has also global speeds in top10 internationally. But i have relatively shitty connection with China, Australia, Canada.

Definetely true

Remember, that avarage websit is using content delivery network (CDN). When i am browsing Facebook, i connect to nearest server, not to main server in USA (or whereever it is).

"*""These token systems are run by small groups of criminals""*

The schemes are run by small groups of criminals. The people giving them money are mostly gambling addicts.

Money hasn't lost any vale of the last century. A dollar is still worth a dollar. You still don't get that a currency is not an asset. A currency is a price.

Bitcoin is priced in dollars. Dollars is the currency. Dollars is a price. You don't buy dollars. You can go buy Bitcoins. It would be pretty stupid, but you can do it.

And you don't need to get a ""majority of nodes"" to do anything. The developers can make a change, one node and run the change and there, bitcoin has been changed.

If the nodes want to run ""Bitcoin Classic"" (oh wait, that exists), they can. That's why there are 20 versions of ""Bitcoin"" out there right now.

And you want to tell me that I don't ""understand Bitcoin"". Ok, champ, tell me this. How will the developers unlimit the number of bitcoins? I'll tell you. One line change. Change line 1139 to:

return 1;

There, the number of bitcoins is unlimited (  if (halvings &gt;=64) return 1 instead of 0)

Bitcoin is centralized right now. The code change can (and likely will) be made above which unlimited the number of bitcoins when the reward hits 0. And mining is certainly centralized with 3 miners owning a majority of the hash power.

If they mine their own chain right now, they can orphan all other blocks and get all the block rewards. They can also cut off the top of the chain and double spend. That can happen right now.

"This. I‚Äôve commented this elsewhere but the ‚ÄúSell everything, buy a lambo‚Äù shtick is very man-child like. The idea is that you spend money to invest, the money matures, you have more money, and you use that to further invest. Someone who invests their money in an index fund that follows the NasDaq or S&amp;P500 after they graduate college and get their first job will have, on average, about 5 doubling times (about 10 years for index funds) until they retire, 7 until they die. That means that you can generally take the money you invest and multiply it by anywhere between 32 and 128 to determine how much you will have at the end of your life. Given the advances in modern medicine, it is also pretty likely that we will see average retirement push higher, even into the 80s and 90s, which suggests that you may have 7 doubling times until you can *stop working*, not just until you die and the money is inherited by your kids.

The serious advantage of strong investments like Bitcoin, or Apple/Google in the 90s, is that they can bypass those doubling times. I have about $1400 in BTC. If it reaches maximal saturation that could probably be worth anywhere between $150K-$300K. In other words, this early investment bypasses the equivalent of 7-8 doubling times. I can, with an investment now, have the same amount of money I would leave to my grandkids if I just held that $1400 in a fidelity account. Then, I can take that 300K and spend it on a house, or stick it into a fidelity account and be able to retire with a guaranteed 9 million dollars at only age 70. Enough for an annual income of 300K until I was 100, or 100K until I was 160. That‚Äôs not even accounting for how much the money might grow while I was consuming it. Hell, at 9M as long as you leave most of the money in an account you can survive indefinitely on 100K per year because the growth rate outpaces your spending.

Obviously the limited amount of BTC in circulation means the economics of such a situation becomes indefinitely more complicated at peak saturation. There are other factors to account for, like the consistent deflation of money, and whether or not a soft or hard fork expands the total amount of BTC to level out the deflationary curve. However, the basic mathematics of stock investment remains the same.",1526441942

"Yes, bubble. Definition of a bubble from Investopedia:

""A bubble is an economic cycle characterized by the rapid escalation of asset prices followed by a contraction. It is created by a surge in asset prices unwarranted by the fundamentals of the asset and driven by exuberant market behavior. When no more investors are willing to buy at the elevated price, a massive sell-off occurs, causing the bubble to deflate.""

I would argue that is what happened from mid-2017 to now. Crypto benefited from a mania from May until Dec/Jan when investors decided they had no interest in buying at those prices because most cryptos still had nothing more than a website and a whitepaper.",1526441688

"Bitcoin network on its own is as open as the Internet itself. Nobody who contributed to ""inventing"" the Internet became billionaires, or even millionaires, because of its open nature. So if you want to make money off of Bitcoin, you need to make money outside of Bitcoin. That is fine as long as you're not the core developer of the protocol itself, but in this case Blockstream is nearly the sole developer of BTC protocol.

Therefore they have a conflict of interest. They know it's impossible to make money by just naively working on Bitcoin protocol itself, which is why they build stuff like lightning network and sidechains. The problem is, if Bitcoin on its own could scale infinitely, all these things like lightning and sidechains would become meaningless therefore Blockstream would lose their potential business model. This is where the conflict of interest comes in. Blockstream is incentivized to make sure Bitcoin doesn't scale on-chain on its own. This has nothing to do with whether this is actually their intention or not today, it's just the way it is.

So to answer your question, if Blockstream finds a scalable solution onchain, it would be completely free just like the Internet, therefore Blockstream would make $0 off of that solution. But if Blockstream finds a scalable solution off chain, they would become a rent-seeker and make money from that, which could have been free had Bitcoin scaled on-chain.

The reason I'm invested in Stellar is mostly that I like the platform. Speed, security, non-Turing smart contracts, an integrated DEX; its fundamentals are incredibly strong. If you go looking for criticism around Stellar, you'll find very little around the platform itself. Most of it will be directed toward the volume of Lumens reserved for future projects. I think its strengths are reflected in the partnerships they've built and the companies that have chosen Stellar to launch their ICOs.  
That's not to say I think they're the only good investment in the market. I think there are some great companies doing great things, aiming at a whole range of different markets. Stellar will most likely see the issuance of the first CBDCs (if what IBM have said is true), so it's probably not for you, if you're looking to avoid banking relationships. I ALSO would rather see our money in our own hands but I'm a realist. The unfortunate truth is that banks are going to be around for a long while. They will grow and evolve with the tech (I worked in IT for one of Australia's big 4 banks, as they went through their transition to SAP real-time banking). They're going to adopt blockchain one way or another and that's going to be a lucrative opportunity for investors who aren't crypto-anarchists. The beauty of crypto is that it's going to give us alternatives to those banks and, one day, when the older generations have passed on and people are being born in to a world where their parents are opening crypto wallets to  save for their college fund, banks will lose their draw. I don't expect that to happen before I retire, though, so I'll be happy to profit off the banking sector for now. :P

As you already noticed very clearly, most of people use btc chain. Ask yourself what people and why?

Most of us who wants to use bitcoin as a currency went to bch chain. Merchants are dropping btc in favour of bch every time btc fees goes up.

It is clear and claimed by block stream that btc is more of store of value rather than currency. Besides, from my personal experience as a merchant I witnessed that btc is unusable when it reaches certain volume and accompanied fees.

Traders and lambo investors also stayed in btc chain pursuing dream of wealth from nowhere. Bch is also affected by this but not on same scale. Currently btc is a gateway of money on most all trading activities and this is where it mostly gets its txs.

So bitcoin core continues as a speculative token and still sucks dumb money, but all the excitement and development goes to bch.

I'm not worried about bch at all. I was able to recognize bitcoin potential years ago and I can see it in bch now.

Never bought or traded bitcoin. Maybe you're confusing bitcoin with chicken sales and trading?,1526437663
"I don't understand. BCH has the same history as BTC before August 1st. They're both the same age. These transaction levels haven't been seen since 2012. How can you not be worried about this when the numbers look so bad?

BTC meanwhile is processing blocks 20x the size on average. This indicates to me that the ratio belongs more around the .05 range. 

Probably looking to work into a BCHBTC short relatively soon. Might have missed the top a few days ago though.",1526437575
"Why would IBM partner with an instamine coin like stellar? Is it to gaslight people who want sound crypto and shit all over satoshi's vision? 

I suppose its better than the other shitcoins, IBM people are rich enough not to care if they distribute future currency to there friends and subordinates, eventually it will trickle down once people actually end up having to earn it.

&gt; At the genesis of the Stellar Network, 100 billion lumens (XLM) were created as specified in the protocol. As part of its custodial mandate, SDF is entrusted to oversee that the vast majority, 95 billion, of the lumens are distributed to the world.",1526437567
"Yes I know it is not literally HR dept., it is employees, staff, etc. I don't really have that much of a problem with spending internally if they are in a growth phase, and overall the sums are pretty small (like it was 20k non-project spend for past month I think). 

It sounds like they are shifting direction a bit and won't really be spending their money on external projects but will spend money to create the fundraising platform (leveraging Lighthouse I guess), as well as spending on their own marketing and their own projects. This isn't necessarily bad, and possibly very good. Certainly a Kickstarter like crowdfunding system is likely better than a few people making some project choices with a dwindling pile of funds. 

But if their initial raise of funds was marketed under ""we will spend on projects"" and now they are like ""we will create our own projects, do good works, and create crowdfunding platform"", then it is a shift (which they've said directly) and certainly if I had donated to them or spent time trying to get a project funded through them, I might be a bit put off even if the end result is better for the Bitcoin Cash in the end.

Whatever you say.  I have no agenda here other than I don't see XRP/Ripple having any meaningful future.  Hyperledger has a much better chance at disrupting the banking industry and you can see my reasons posted in this thread.

"Being in crypto for as long as he has been, has he *really* accomplished that much for the space? XRP is a giant misunderstanding for the space and I can't really give it credit for it's rank. Ripple's XRP has rank because it has been around for a long time and it is cheap. 

People have been parroting that they [Ripple] are going to help banks get involved with crypto since the beginning of time. I think there have been something like 4 banks that have ever used XRP. I'm sure I'm not fully up to date, but as a crypto enthusiast, I tend to want to avoid something *for* banks. I'm pretty sure most crypto-heads would rather see the banks lose their chance than give them a helping hand.

There's a lot of talent out there in crypto. Between BTC, ADA, VEN &amp; ETH alone there's some serious talent. They're working on changing the world, not just a new token that they hold a giant percentage of. How much did nanex.co help the community? Bad example, but still. I'm struggling to see why we should care, other than ""anything new is a good for the space"" mentality.

"&gt;1500 TPS, but cobalt is currently in production and it will increase to a higher standard as that will be required. The eventual number would be alot higher, 10k-50k

Even LN has that beat :)  

&gt;Banks are not 'stuck' with xrp, they use marketmakers for that - unless the bank wants to be a marketmaker  

&gt; Do you know that interledger connects to hyperledger?  

Yes, because they joined Hyperledger!  Which goes with my point that it would make more sense to adopt Hyperledger, so even IF XRP were to take off it could just be another extension of it.  Why limit themselves to just using Ripple?  And again with Hyper they could literally use any crypto

They are if they want that extra 2% savings or whatever # you would say their marketing material was incorrect about.  

&gt; banks having their own coin is only for internal use  
Ok, so use Hyper to make their own coin for that use case then use any other industry-wide standard coin for inter-bank (which could be made on Hyper as well....  or not that's how flexible it is).  

Think of it this way, why would the banks go with a private companies coin (XRP) when they could just literally make their own token on Hyper with the same benefits?  If crypto is to change the banking industry why wouldn't they all come to an agreement on a token they create themselves?  

&gt;Even if they use Hyperledger, they'd use XRP.  

Again totally disagree, Hyperledger is much much more flexible, offers the same benefits, can also solve other business areas XRP can't and is not owned by a private company.  

I'm done for now, good talk.

"Wrote this a few days ago, feels good to be vindicated. Time to take my bags back at a discount:

The reason why Consensus is being hyped is because last year it coincided with a massive bull run. A week before Consensus 2017, Bitcoin was trading at $1800 give or take. Ethereum was around $90 and in third place behind Ripple.

The weekend of Consensus, Bitcoin had gone up to $2100 and Ethereum almost doubled to $170 and overtook XRP in the Top 100.

People think that 2018 will create the same fervor because they inaccurately attribute Consensus as the cause of the bullrun. Here's what's gonna happen at 2018 Consensus:

Nothing. A week after it Ethereum will be trading in the 680-770 range. I dunno about Bitcoin because I don't fuck with bullshit. Any other alts you're in who knows. Maybe if you're lucky and the alt roulette wheel hits in one you own you can attribute it to Consensus and stir up some FOMO among some gullible nerds so you can dump your bags on them like a fat dude after an all you can eat promotion at Taco Bell. ",1526436094
"Ok, great. I also agree that Bitcoin is still in its ""beta"" phase and that a lot of engineering still needs to take place. I also agree with your list of goals:

1) Maximizing the number and diversity of decision makers in the system.
2) Maximizing the system's security.
3) Hundreds of billions of transactions per day.
4) Low latency transactions.
5) Low cost transactions.

Of all the forms of Byzantine consensus systems I have looked at, including Ripple's, NANO's, various proof-of-stake schemes, mining, layer-2 networks, side chains, sharding, and even non-Byzantine stuff like the raft consensus algorithm, proof-of-work seems like it can accomplish all these goals simultaneously, and it does this with big blocks.

When it comes to number 1, there are different types of decision makers, including node operators, miners, stakers, hubs, and so forth. All the consensus systems I have looked at have on thing in common, though. They all require some class of decision maker that observes all hundred-billion transactions per day (goal 3). In the case of proof-of-work, it's the miners. For NANO, it's the voting nodes. Lightning has this problem too. To find a route through the ever-changing Lightning channels of 8 billion users, you need to observe all hundred-billion transactions per day to maintain an accurate map. The more incomplete your map is, the lower your odds of making a successful payment.

The only way to get around this problem is to shard the network in a way that requires trust (lowering security), or to shard the network in a way that breaks fungibility (so you have to do an exchange when sending funds from one sub-network to another). I am not aware of any exceptions to this rule.

For goal 2, proof-of-work has SPV, which means that even lightweight nodes can be secure. Lightning networks can also use SPV, thanks to their host chain. For the other consensus mechanisms, you need to observe the voting process to have security, or at least the staking balances. Therefore, light clients have to trust whatever full node they connect to, which defeats the whole point.

For goal 3, proof of work can certainly handle hundreds of billions of transactions per day. The bandwidth, storage, and equipment costs are about $50k a year at this level of operation - pricey for an individual, but cheap for a company (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKFkhWWiLDk). The cost of running a Lightning node capable of routing arbitrary payments anywhere in the world would be about the same, since it would need to track a roughly equivalent number of open channel states.

For goal 4, proof-of-work doesn't do low-latency payments out-of-the-box as Satoshi designed it, but there are several strategies for making this work, including weak blocks, Bitcoin-NG, Ansible, and others. These mechanisms also have the nice side-effect of making block propagation a lot more efficient.

For goal 5, proof-of-work transactions should cost as much as the marginal unit of work needed to include them in a block. Basically, miners incur some costs in terms of storage, bandwidth, and block propagation time for every transaction they include. The mining fee should be roughly equivalent to this marginal cost. Nobody knows what this marginal cost really is, since we have never had a uncapped, unsubsidized mining market before. I'm willing to bet it's pretty low.

This is the design space as I see it. This isn't ""obsessing over block size as a brute force solution,"" it's doing the engineering work needed to enable one of the only possible solutions to the problem. Lightning networks are another possible solution, but they eventually require big blocks to reach global scale anyhow. Barring any game-breaking inventions, this is basically the only way forward.",1526436086

BTC is the only coin that has not increased their blocksize as needed. Regarding Dash, I used to like it, until I saw [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBxbiH_Mg44). Also, if it's centralization you're afraid of, you should realize that LN leads to far greater centralization. LN forces users to be online all the time, unless they pay a third party ""watch tower"" to look after their coins. It also dis-incentivizes people to move their coins to their own private wallet, because on chain fees would be too expensive. It centralizes mining because small miners are unable to move their mining rewards to an exchange to sell them, due to the high cost of on chain fees. Adam Back (CEO of Blocktream) has said fees of $100 will probably become common if things go the way he envisions. And even if LN worked, it would still have to be _simpler, and more practical_ on chain transactions, other coins, and basic legacy systems, like a credit card. So basically LN has a ton of problems. Some of these were described here: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYHFrf5ci_g). Additionally, you are assuming that BCH is both opposed to the Lightning Network or any secondary scaling solutions. This is a myth. LN can be used on whatever coin someone wants to put it on. Think of it like luggage rack for a car. The underlying coin is still the underlying coin. All that would need to be done is for there to be a malleability fix, which could be done with a simple hardfork (segwit is not actually necessary). To give you an idea, I have even heard of Monero talking about possibly implementing LN one day. LN was never meant to replace 99% of on chain transactions. It was originally designed for specific use cases, specifically microtransactions. Say for example, someone loads up an LN channel while they gamble all night at the penny slots. And in this sense, LN may have value, **if** it ever got figured out. But to put your faith behind it over many other coins is dangerous at best. Lastly, you are assuming no improvements to the BCH software. With things like Graphene being worked on, BCH transactions could be 90% smaller relatively quickly. BCH does not have an immediate scaling problem at all.

The price in real terms has not risen. What happened is that the bitcoin lost purchasing power. 

Bread did not cost more bitcoin because there was a global shortage of bread. It cost more bitcoin because bitcoin was worth less. That's why inflation is an ""increase in the **overall** level of prices"" - the reason why ALL prices rise is because the one common variable - the value of money - falls. This is inflation.

"&gt; and then ripple even has a faster and cheaper product

What is their TPS?  Technologically this is impossible as Hyperledger is a permission chain so inherently there is no way it could be faster.
&gt;my goal is not to convince you to buy XRP  
Any I'm just explaining why I don't see it happening in any meaningful way  

&gt;Using a private blockchain doesn't improve any trust - even worse, it would be the opposite of what they want  
This is flat out wrong, and Hyperledger is more precicely a permissioned blockchain not private - you can however create a private blockchain with it as well, or a fully public blockchain.  

Except with Hyperledger, a bank isn't just stuck with XRP it could use any form of crypto it wanted or easily create it's own coin that it's partners agree to use.  Hyperledger IMO is just much much more flexible and why I see it ultimately being the winner in this sphere.  Hell even Ripple joined Hyperledger.  I am pretty sure there are more banks piloting Hyper than Ripple right now, and a few dozen oficially joining the Hyperledger Foundation which is an even bigger commitment.  Add to this banks can do much more with Hyper than Ripple in other areas of their business.  

I wish you luck man, well see in the end.

"You have not shown anything. The telegram \(not telegraph\) screenshot I posted directly contradicts what you are saying. You're confusing some sort of flat fee for deployment with network fees propogated by nodes operating the network. This is a wholly different thing than what you asserted in the OP \(that ""running a dapp on them requires not just permission, but also payment""\). There is going to be a cost any DLT for it to operate. Whether its hidden through delegation tokens \(EOS\), PoW on dags \(tangle\), or basic tx fees and block rewards \(Bitcoin/Ethereum\), they all have fees one way or another. There is no free lunch in this space.

&gt;There is no PoW tax on IOTA that's completely wrong. There is the minor thermodynamic cost that is near zero. You pay nothing but your computer performs a simple calculation. It's like saying there is a cost to opening a browser.

To send a tx you must validate two txs. The validation of two txs is the PoW tax. There's a reason why certain IoT applications cannot operate on IOTA, and its because of this fact. It may be very minimal cost in isolation, but is not a near zero cost at scale. Clearly you're an IOTA fan, so we can spare this argument for another time. ",1526434556

"since you post it twice i will too: i'll help you on your way a bit but please do further research yourself on this matter. Ripple has 3 products - one of them is xCurrent, this is competing with swift, r3 and IBM. In addition to this, there are two other products: xRapid and xVia. Both use XRP but both are currenly at the last stage of testing: production ready is waiting around the corner. If you have knowledge of software development and enrolling software you know this isnt something you do in a day. Tests with xRapid were conducted during Q1 - beginning of Q2, and are now brought back to the devs table to further improve before going live. xRapid and xVia use XRP - xCurrent doesnt. hence the name xCURRent and XRaPid (currency / xrp).

&amp;nbsp;
 
anyway - lets begin at the beginning. Ripple's Joelkatz (david schwartz) offered to show up but was ignored because they have had twitter disagreements before where david schooled them about how misinformed and biased they were, and how factually wrong their standpoints where. if you go through the tweets of ryan and laura im sure you will find these tweets in a few minutes. They wanted Brad to attend (ceo) but brad doesnt have time to go on a BTC/ETH podcast to talk about XRP, he has a business to run and decissions to make. Its like asking playstation asking bill gates to come on a podcast - its weird they even mentioned it that way as the entire twitter community - mostly their audience, knew that david said he would be available (david co-designed XRP, helped creating it, knows all features and is involved in every ripple product on both the techincal side and knows alot about the marketing).
 
&amp;nbsp;

33% saving by ripplenet / xcurrent, 80-90% saving by using xRapid, but the actual saving part for banks comes in on nos/vos accounts, as they eliminate the need for banks to hold dorment currencies for customers as using xRapid would open up their liquidity as they would be able to provide the currencies in a matter of seconds. This is something very usefull for banks as you can imagine. Please know that ripple always downplays their own tech as they dont want to promise figures they cant deliver. They stated the xrp to fiat transaction would take 10 minutes but it only took 2, the xrp part only took seconds. the costs stated people save with xrapid is based on multiple factors - do they hold xrp themselves or buy it when needed for the transaction. Calculated its about 90% savings - this also depends on the banks and from what country to what country you are sending, and what banks are using (not all banks use the same fee while xRapid has the same price for everything).
 
&amp;nbsp;

so the savings% on tx that they stated is not correct - and the additional savings they get by increasing their liquidity by reducing the amount of dorment currencies comes additional to that. 

&amp;nbsp;

please do know that the large majority of crypto turned away from this podcast, not because it said things that they didnt want to hear but because they were pushing out misinformation deliberately while knowing the actual story, mostly to get the attention to get views and hoping that it would trigger Brad to come to the show as that would hugely increase their influence by followers and views.

"I believe that Feb/Mar was the initial intention for the testing phase.

On the Jed thing, I'd note that FairX is built on the SDEX, as any project can be, but not directly run by Stellar in any way. With Jed's history, there are a couple of ways to look at it (I won't pretend that either is totally right). Jed sold his share of Mt Gox before it was hacked. What he did or didn't know about it has been a point of much contention, but the bottom line is that he has not been charged with anything. Until he is, I'll consider him innocent until proven guilty. It's definitely a blemish, though. On the other hand, Mt Gox WAS hugely important to the crypto space. He also created eDonkey and Overnet. He may have parted ways with Ripple over some differences, but you can't argue that Ripple hasn't been hugely successful (even if it's a little overhyped). His track record for innovative technology speaks for itself. The guy is clearly one of the more talented people in crypto.",1526432535

"I wrote more about what I mean [here](https://medium.com/@tyzbit/why-the-lightning-network-is-more-than-meets-the-eye-969ff0c27ea8) but TL;DR:

* No one has a ‚Äúfull picture‚Äù of the Lightning Network, because of its decentralized nature
* Channels can be hidden or private between nodes, and not announced to the network at large
* Lightning can operate on multiple compatible blockchains, separately or at once.

The decentralized nature part is a big one.  It's not reasonable to expect everyone to know about everyone--all that matters is that you yourself know about the nodes you need to know about.  Some parts of the network will just be too far from you for your node to care.  My graph probably looks different from yours because who we initially bootstrapped from, and who we have channels with are different.

Contrast this with, say, the UTXO set of Bitcoin.  Anyone in the world can check this set for themselves or on any honest node and get the full, same answer - it's objective, not subjective.",1526431300

"'Decentralized' means having as many decision\-makers and contributors as possible. it means having as few single\-point\-of\-control weaknesses as can be managed. It has nothing to do with corporations or governments necessarily: those are just different interests, and may or may not be aiming to do 'bad' things. We don't need to make that judgement. The principle is to aim for the greatest possible diversity among the group of people that maintain the network.

I believe that the system we are building needs to be able to handle hundreds of billions of transactions per day, with sub\-second latency \(for some transactions, but not necessarily all\), unbreakable security, maximal reliability \(data is never, ever lost and the service is always available\) and relatively low cost per transaction \(as low as can be achieved without compromising any other requirement\). Cost per transaction is the one point that is non\-critical. Lower is better, but having low transaction costs isn't sufficiently valuable to compromise on the need for a clear commitment to decentralization as the ultimate requirement.

If Bitcoin isn't the fully decentralized, universal ledger for human civilization then it is just a novelty and we might as well keep using Visa and PayPal and Apple Pay and Google Pay and Wells Fargo.

This is why I believe that the current Bitcoin is pre\-release \- or 'Beta' \- software and the engineering isn't done yet. Do everything that can be done to improve the network without in any respect increasing \(or opening the door to increasing\) centralization is at the top of the list. Obsessing over block size as a brute force solution to transaction fees even thought eh current blocks aren't full and there is no issue with fee costs seems like a huge effort and a long argument for no reason.

Hard forks are not a risk when you have consensus.  This is why Core is so afraid of them, they rarely have true consensus.

 As for the op codes being implemented when they are necessary and appropriate... did you know the whole ecosystem that is Ethereum and all the tokens built on it would have been on Bitcoin if those opcodes had not been disabled?  So much demand and mindshare slipped away already.

"It doesn't work like that. 

It's not a matter of maths but a matter of belief and confidence by those who use it.

Also, you are assuming only Bitcoin exists as a crypto currency, which is false. Retailers are already accepting other cryptos, such as Litecoin and Ethereum, so you have to count those in also.
",1526429566
"This is for the ecosystem to decide.  Atomic swaps and rootstock will allow a multitude of niche cryptos and tokenised assets to co-exist, using bitcoin as the underlying settlement layer. 

Indeed, many of the existing alts / tokens are already prepping for layer 2.

There will be all kinds of use cases: e.g. local currencies in townships in Africa powering a grassroots makers economy, crowd owned websites, the machine payable web, digitised stock markets for traditional company flotations, digital customer loyalty schemes, social network capital, IoT...

All of them will require some kind of other ledger off the main chain untethered to bitcoin as a unit of account, but dependent on Bitcoin as a trusted tamper-proof settlement layer.",1526429563
"I lost about 12 BTC in the first crash and was very discouraged so i moved my coin to Bitcoin QT which i believe is now Core, it was the best decision i ever made, because i was going to sell around $1000 but i hadn't synced my wallet in forever, by the time it was synced it crashed again and i said fuck it till it got to where it was when i sold. Had i had it in an exchange or had my wallet synced, id have sold a long time ago.",1526429488
"Definitely, in no way would robinhood kill coinbase. Some people hate to hear it but coinbase is here to stay unless they get caught up in extreme fraud. They're positioning themselves very well for this new type of market.

I will say adding volume turnover in exchanges should have an effect even if it never leaves the exchange. You're right too that robinhood will get the foot in the door and get them interested in crypto.",1526429424
"This isn't just for credit anymore, they're applying the ban to debit as well. Can't use RBC on QuadrigaCX anymore. Bisq is trading at 8\-10&amp;#37; premium for Canadian buyers with very low volume.

"I should have been clearer about what I think it means, but it really is just my opinion. The issue is that a lot of FairX has been done in secrecy (Dowling even stated that it was going to be kept under wraps a lot longer than it was but some internet sleuthing forced it out in to the light of day), so there's very little that's been made known about what FairX actually is. ""Not a Coinbabe competitor"" more than likely means that FairX is not going to JUST be a crypto exchange. The assumption, based on the fact that they had to wait for regulations before moving forward, is that they will be MORE than a Coinbase competitor, in that (as the SDEX can facilitate) it may allow for the tokenization of MULTIPLE asset types, not just crypto and fiat. I don't doubt that it will offer fiat &gt; crypto trading.",1526429275
"That reads like more we'll do crypto company pump, all theory no meat.  So not only do you need a bunch of other users to bounce through (density around 9 per 3 mile), you have to bounce until you find a gotenna user with cell phone internet, blue-toothed to gotenna, and running the same crypto app, you will have to broadcast to find that person, and trust their app to be legit, and it will currently have to be within 4 hops to find that white elephant in the desert.

Seams like they really need to switch to having those dongles to have 3G/wifi built in, and find a way to reward people for providing a gateway for others.  Gotenna would have been interesting, when the network could be used to also send and receive text to people who don't have the hardware or gotenna app installed, and to be able to bridge your mesh with internet as well, so be able to hop from gotenna networks that were not connected via the gotenna mesh, but when both networks are internet connected.  But that will require master nodes, high data use...",1526429256

"I have no hate for LN. I think it has it's uses. If I looked at the proposal and thought, ""hey this is really good. It will preserve all the useful properties of Bitcoin while keeping blocks easy to validate"" then I would have supported it and might still be a BTC supporter.

But it was always obvious to me that the claims being made about LN were an extreme long shot to actually be true and that LN was being radically oversold in an attempt to kill the blocksize increase by convincing people who aren't technical enough to evaluate it for themselves.

Yes LN is currently in beta, but in beta it's performing even worse than I thought it would. I do suspect the route failure rate will come down. I don't expect it to come down to a rate where a decentralized network topology is viable. 

And while centralized hubs may work, we'll have to wait and see if it will be viable to run a hub at scale.",1526428159

Personally, I took that to mean that they will accept it as long as things are going well and if things don't go well they can simply stop and it won't take an act of state congress to amend the legislation.  Technically, Seminole county is the first to outright accept it without caveats. ",1526428073

In economics, deflation is a decrease in the general price level of goods and services. Deflation occurs when the inflation rate falls below 0% (a negative inflation rate).

I don't trust him either (never met him).  The good news is, you don't have to!  It took Roger months of fence sitting before he joined the BCH party.

Me too!  Many of us in the BCH community don't think that infinitely increasing the blocksize is a sustainable scaling solution.  We also know that the network effect of money is real and even 32mb blocks will have a negligible effect on miner centralization.  Scaling decisions should be data driven and not arbitrarily chosen by a handful of devs that happen to have commit access to the most popular client (especially when they have a major conflict of interest and support censorship of censorship resistant money).

&gt;  I‚Äôd like to see this civil war come to an end.

This war started because of the censorship.  Until the other sub is able to hear both sides of the argument, the war rages on.  Join us in promoting free speech in r/btc .  Everyone is welcome here.

"Yeah kinda crazy how much good information is being discovered of late by the community. Some really cools things happening, I think from a price point the books are pretty thin as so many tokens are locked into GMN's and MN's so it doesn't take much for larger traders to dictate the price movement, Quick pumps are followed with quick sell offs in the 10 Percent range quite regularly. 

I'd say once token swap happens, we will see the BTC ratio start to climb, Sub Chain Transaction fees, ICO's, The new marketing team will start to kick into gear and start giving out project information instead of the community having to dig for it will really help spread the word. 

It doesn't take to much research to see that WaltonChain is an amazing project with a massive team approaching 300 People. The government ties and collaboration with some of the largest Chinese companies will catapult this project into the spot light soon enough. It's just hard at the moment as allot of this stuff hasn't been addressed by the team in detail for NDA reasons or who knows. If WaltonChain were as good with marketing as they were with Tech and expanding their empire, the price would be where allot of investors think it should be.

So what will cause a dramatic price move? Something enormous like a partnership with the US FED, the Chinese president promoting a coin, Amazon exclusively accepting crypto payments.

"hedging on either side is a good idea because some form of bitcoin is likely to succeed.

regarding this:

&gt; I agree with the fundamental argument that increasing block size continuously will lead to centralization

Have you considered that moving things off chain as a scaling solution also leads to centralization?   If LN really worked and was a compelling solution, BCH would likely not even exist.  But the reality it can only work with large centralized hubs.  ",1526426946
"Is anyone else bothered by all these coins where 30%+ of the total supply is not in circulation.

Looking at some coins in the top 20, the creators/foundation behind the coin own several billion dollars worth of their token, assuming they could actually sell it all at market price.

I get that it's useful to keep a chunk to ensure the development team is adequately funded, but at the moment you have teams of 20 people and a handful of developers if you're lucky, sitting on several billion dollars. Crypto is crazy.

",1526426849
"Designing the mining structure this way puts the chain at risk of spam and hard forking due to node disagreement. What happens when there's no limit and the network is attacked (as we've seen with BTC). What happens when half the network rejects a block or what? The resulting situation is untenable for a decentralized, consensus-based network.

This goes without even addressing the point that, once again, BCH is barely surpassing 50 Kb blocks, let alone 1 or 8 Mb. This is just silly attempt to hype the project. ",1526426829

Governments wanted to ban cash... but they didn't count on Bitcoin.,1526426797
"I am a small blocker (just not a fundamentalist), I don't want big blocks, I want more growth in adoption and price the byproduct of this is more transactions and in bitcoin, that means writing them to the blockchain, ie bigger blocks.  

As a rationalist the compromise is:

If you want more transaction in bitcoin you need to write more transactions to the blockchain **i.e. you get bigger blocks, coincidentally I want small blocks** I just don't advocate restricting adoption and growth. 

The solution to my paradox is to move the block limit above the demand for block space because no one has a right to block people from using bitcoin. 

While we have smaller blocks with Bitcoin BCH it's becaue it has fewer users who make fewer transactions. 

And if you are not paying attention, I have bitcoin which means I have Both BTC and BCH. I win regardless of which fork wins; I'm invested in both. 

Only those who have fallen for the small block scam have sold their BCH. - the scammers have all mad their money and left.

"Be careful with your usage of the term Bcash if your looking for impartial information. That phrase is employed in a derogatory manner against Bitcoin Cash, so your own use of it will automatically attract people who wish to bash the coin. Calling it Bitcoin Cash or BCH will help you avoid confusing people of your intentions.

As an experiment, I'd recommend posting this exact same topic onto r/btc (a sub with a high degree of favor towards BCH) and r/Bitcoin (a sub with a high degree of favor towards BTC) and see what happens.

"&gt;&gt; Median tx fee is based on real on-chain fee-paying transactions.
 
&gt; I completely understand this, but you must agree that high fees we can see by median stats on LTC (as well on BTC, but much less) chain are not caused by network requirements itself. We can play just now - LUju8ZkDCRUyVepkBDHRLz2GkiGCZCngPw , send me some tiny amount with fee 1 sat/b, ill send you back. you will see that such fee works perfectly. Blocks on LTC are not full, so there is no real reason why your tx should hang
&gt; 
&gt; https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/88ky2l/bitasiaex_founder_and_ceo_says_sm_selfish_mining/

The same is true for median tx fees for BCH. The actual minimum default and standard min relay would be around $0.0033, not $0.0054. There are some people who have successfully sent 1 Sat. TOTAL fee (not per byte) on Bitcoin Cash and had them confirm. Though I'm not sure how to do this, don't recommend it right now, and haven't tried myself.

I don't have any LTC right now, and not looking to buy any.

&gt; This exchange is far from major one. Anyway thanks, i thought there are no. I will actually not be surprised that this one is the only. So my point stays right, that when you are forced to relay on payment verification, you need to get confirmations. This is actually what PoW is about in general.

I mean, if I ran an exchange I probably wouldn't have 0-conf for anything above like $100/day per user. It's not really meant to be used by exchanges, just merchants and probably BTMs.

&gt; anyway, you mentioned just theory. in real live usage risks of hijacking transaction on BTC or BCH or LTC are almost zero. and you always can wait for needed confirmations, it is not an issue. what you are talking about is same that ill be bubbling about tx malleability. No risk in general. More risky is to be afraid that sender will come to you, and holding gun near your head will force you to reveal private keys.

Exactly! But the problem with 0-conf on BTC is that when RBF transactions are standard, you literally can't trust it.

&gt; not sold, but moved. we dont know sold or not.

Yes, only the people who make the actual transactions know the who/what for/why

&gt; In conclusion, i want to say that while my opinion may be understood as 'against BCH' it actually not true. As i said earlier, i am using BCH as well, i see potential in some specific use-cases for this coin, but IMHO it is overvalued not in price metrics, but in informational background. Things we are talking about are faaaaaar away from avarage user.

All I'm trying to say is there's a lot more going on with BCH then you may realize:

This was originally meant for BTC, but was shelved with all the fees and controversy:

https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8jm2i3/preview_looks_like_lighthouse_powered_by_bitcoin/

I believe this was proposed for the next BTC HF, whenever that may be. Already live on BCH:

https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8joo00/first_tree_signature_on_bitcoin_cash_using_new/

And on and on, more and more things are being worked on every day. 

I just don't see this amount of development going on with LTC, and a lot of businesses left BTC in 2017.

Also, LTC's drop in usage was much greater than BCH's, though both seem to be recovering, unlike BTC:

https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactions-btc-eth-bch-ltc-sma30.html#log&amp;1y

(It's probably impossible to tell how many ETH transactions are pure ETH, and not a token transfer, that's why I tend to ignore it.)

If LTC get's used more, great. I Just don't see it being as useful as BCH.

Good luck!",1526426297
"BTC is wholly ""owned"" by Blockstream so I don't quite understand your concerns about 'centralization' for BCH.

But you cannot send BTC and have it end up in a BCH wallet, and vice versa.

"There is one more thing that i thought of but maybe most of us wont admit it, people just dont want to get dumped holding heavy bags of nothing while they worked their ass off to get that money that is now worthless and you cannot get it out.The fomo we are talking about works only if someone buys it at a higher price then you did.That is where the gains come from, and i think ordinary people are well aware of it.

Not saying it wont happen cause the Cartel will push it one more time to ATHs and more, i am pretty sure of it and human greed is a powerful thing, if nothing the price will at least double when block reward halves just based on scarcity.

But for you to have gains someone has to lose and lose a lot, i just dont see any other way for you to make money on anything in this market.

Why Apple and Microsoft have so large MC, i see people here often making that comparison, well they have fucking working products that people buy for decades and both are shilled to the heavens from media.Both are shits but they actually do something IRL, the only reason we pumped last year is to get this into public view and to get as many people possible to FOMO in and to sell them the top, not because of anything real.

We might not actually see the bull run in near time cause now people are kinda aware of it and are waiting for it, which is precisely why i predict it wont happen when everyone expects.

The November-December run came like a storm and out of nowhere.

Just my two cents, i am bullish by nature and i want to believe, maybe i just dont want to admit i maybe lost the single biggest chance to get rich last year in my life and now i want it just one more time, so i am writing this from my brain because i have doubts it will happen again.

Plus all this ""institutional"" money coming in, i dont like it one bit.
IMO a sign of pacification of the market and slower gains, more stock like..meh.

Block size limitations are simply a transaction flood control measure. Building flood control tuned for the average transaction level is insane because it causes pressure to move elsewhere (fees, for instance... Or moving to other cryptocurrency implementations, like how BTC lost a lot of financial activity to Ethereum or Litecoin)

Real-world flood control is designed to handle 500-year or 1000-year storm events. Transaction flood control can be less since a few occurrences of backlog won't drive people away to other platforms unless it happens consistently. The occasional full block is ok, several full blocks in a row isn't. 

If the goal is to have a transaction be accepted in a block within an hour, even with a backlog, you have 196 Meg's of space available compared to BTC's 7.5ish (I'm counting Segwit) Meg's available.

BCH is bow built to handle floods! When blocks have an average of 8 Meg's of transactions, 64mb or 128mb limits are probably in order.",1526425297

 - What was the selfish and dangerous thing you mention in the first paragraph?

 - Vitalik had many conversations with the Core development team seeking to build out Ethereum on Bitcoin. However, the Core devs actively pushed him away and we're so negative to him that he ended up building a protocol dedicated to Ethereum instead. The Op_Codes we're not being used as abundantly as they might have been at that time, but their potential was/is massive and reenabling them is very important for the future of tokens on the Blockchain.

 - Whether or not the blocks are full is not the reason that raising the cap is important. It's crticial that the cap is high enough to facilitate ease of use while allowing enough room for new community growth. The block size was never supposed to be hit and raising it periodically to keep abreast of growth was discussed in the first few months of Bitcoins creation

The truth is that IBM's visibility is mostly limited to big business, not the general public and they have been, in the last decade:  

\- Industry leaders in Cloud Computing, at the SaaS, IaaS and PaaS levels. Last year they ranked 3rd, only behind Amazon and Microsoft but beating out Salesforce and SAP.  

\- Industry leaders in AI, Big Data and IoT, with IBM Watson and their Data Analytics products.  

On top of that, they have LONG term trust relationships with major banks and financial institutions all over the world, through their fintech.  

As for FairX, that's not even an IBM offering. The confusion there is that Michael Dowling \(the ex\-CTO of IBM's Blockchain arm\) is heading up the project. There's very little revealed yet about what it IS, but it's been made clear that it's NOT a Coinbase competitor, suggesting that it will leverage the tokenization capabilities of the SDEX is ways far greater than just fiat \&gt; crypto. To give further weight to the potential importance of FairX, Dowling actually quit his CTO position at IBM to focus entirely on FairX, last week.

That is neither here nor there we both have our opinions and they are not going to change in a reddit thread.  

The answer was clear segwit and double the block size but no one asked me!  At the time i was for op-codes, but after kryptokitties nonsense... i am kinda glad they were removed. 

I am not sure i follow on how increasing the size of blocks that aren't even half full and reintroducing a feature that wasn't really used can be considered important. Segwit allowed for a whole spectrum of features and integrations that we are still coming up with possibilities at the cost of 0 confirmations (Which i believe is a personal preference rather than a whitepaper bound item).

I guess in the end we will see what was more important to Bitcoin tree.

As of right now, there's not a reason for the general public to give a shit about any of this, but it's worth it's weight in gold to any public/private sector business/entity/etc. to adopt blockchain technologies in order to stay competitive, and also to take advantage of great technology.

 It makes sense that what's happening now  is the first step, for major business and government to implement blockchain. Only after this will the public actually catch on and utilize crypto, once it's easier, more convenient, transparent, etc, for them to make blockchain transactions.

"There are unrelenting shillers for every single crypto; so in my opinion, that's silly to bring up. From what I read of the PoA post, there were plenty of legitimate arguments against that were not downvoted into oblivion. It is only when people attack it in an emotional manner that they get downvoted. For example, if i write ""I have some concerns with this because of ... a, b, c"" vs ""This sucks and won't work at all because of ... a, b, c"", the 2nd option is way more likely going to get downvoted because of how it is written. And this is the same for every single reddit sub I've ever seen. If things are written in an emotional way, you can expect an emotional response. I've personally posted multiple critiques in the VEN subreddit against it which were actually upvoted and met with reasonable responses.

Which similar tokens have similar progress and the same level of adoption? VEN is one of the few cryptos that has well-known enterprise companies tweeting about it on a regular basis, and even shilling it to an extent. PWC and DNV GL have both announced minority stakes and pledged to use VeChain's blockchain, and they are the ones who said it themselves, not VeChain. If you think these companies didn't do their due diligence prior to investing, you are wrong. DNV GL has even placed its reputation on the line to vouch for VeChain. Show me some similar progress from other competitor tokens.

Again, yes it is overvalued, just like 100% of the rest of the market, so ""overvalued"" is not a reason to hate against it. VeChain holders have become defensive because there have been a ton of people hating against VeChain for no legitimate reason.

Because it means it will rise in value (in absolute but not necessarily relative terms) in response to inflation.

You second question I don't understand - how could Bitcoin (or any commodity) be expected to control the inflation of whatever it's being priced in?

&gt;The buying power of Bitcoin can grossly fluctuate, just not as a result of monetary policy, which is in fact a method of controlling its value.

&gt;Your little semantic nitpicks are meaningless.

&gt; Median tx fee is based on real on-chain fee-paying transactions.

I completely understand this, but you must agree that high fees we can see by median stats on LTC (as well on BTC, but much less) chain are not caused by network requirements itself. We can play just now - LUju8ZkDCRUyVepkBDHRLz2GkiGCZCngPw , send me some tiny amount with fee 1 sat/b, ill send you back. you will see that such fee works perfectly.

This exchange is far from major one. Anyway thanks, i thought there are no. I will actually not be surprised that this one is the only. So my point stays right, that when you are forced to relay on payment verification, you need to get confirmations. This is actually what PoW is about in general.

&gt; It's a proposal:

anyway, you mentioned just theory. in real live usage risks of hijacking transaction on BTC or BCH or LTC are almost zero. and you always can wait  for needed confirmations, it is not an issue. what you are talking about is same that ill be bubbling about tx malleability. No risk in general. More risky is to be afraid that sender will come to you, and holding gun near your head will force you to reveal private keys.

&gt;  BCH was sold from them

not sold, but moved. we dont know sold or not.

&gt;  Interesting times ahead.

Completely agree.

In conclusion, i want to say that while my opinion may be understood as 'against BCH' it actually not true.

"You show a pretty strong prejudice when you arbitrarily declare anyone involved with cryptocurrency creation ""small groups of criminals."" Do I get to win an argument by describing the Fed members that way?

Bitcoin scarcity is fixed FAR more strongly than the scarcity of dollars. Dollar scarcity is simply a function of Federal Reserve voting, and they vote to inflate the money supply regularly, with the result that it has lost 98% of its value over the past century.

In order to change the Bitcoin mining schedule you would need to get the majority of the nodes to adopt the change. That's easy to say, in much the same way that ""let's go to Mars"" is easy to say. The hard part is getting a majority of people to adopt a change that would dilute the value of their Bitcoins. So as a practical matter there's no risk whatever of Bitcoin losing value this way.

Your last lines betray a complete absence of understanding about how Bitcoin works. The miners are not in control (as they found out last year). If they don't like the fee market, tough, they can drop out and quit mining. People won't dilute their holdings just to placate miners greed.

Centralized fiat currencies are dying. You can put a brave face on it, but fewer and fewer people are going to trust their wealth to centralized systems that have a long track record of being manipulated and diluted, now that we have an alternative.

"&gt; Is this supposed to be insulting? I'm fully aware that LN needs to scale in tandem with block increases.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; You don't think Segwit was a block increase?

It was a one-time block increase, nowhere near what's needed, and your coin is being run by people who say there will never be another block-size increase.

By their own metric then, Lightning cannot scale to global payments, ever.

And how do you think Liquid fits into all of this? Why is Blockstream working on Liquid while another company entirely worked on Lightning.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;It absolutely is. You'll find Lightning network doesn't get you very far, strictly on usability grounds alone.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; This is moronic. 

Not at all. Here's a BTC-partisan trying to complete a Lightning payment. Takes nearly 4 minutes and the payment fails.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgjUXi6XXFc

Having a doubly-bifurcated coin is a UX nightmare. You think some non-techie is going to know they need to use segwit to pay to a lightning channel, wait for 6 confirms and the intricacies of how Lightning works? Watchtowers and dual balances and all sorts of shit like that?

&gt; It's not. BTC has far more volume and a network to boot. 

You don't get it. This is just carryover from before the Core takeover of BTC. Once BTC hit its blocksize cap and the devs refused to raise it, this is going to drain away.

&gt; You're just throwing out completely baseless assertions, hoping they'll stick.

Nah, I'm tossing facts that you don't want to hear. You cannot tell me that UX on Lightning isn't a massive nightmare for normies right now. 

This is why Blockstream is making Liquid, they want normies to keep their coin on exchanges and never do on-chain transactions ever. They don't care if BTC dies. BTC is being stabbed in the back by the very people who control it, and you refuse to see it.

That's kinda my point. How long from the transaction being broadcast to the network to being included in a block? 1 Block? 10 Blocks? Minimum fee BCH transactions are in the next block 99.99% of the time.

&gt;Maybe it is because that BTC had same status on 1st Aug '18? Most of BTC users dont even get how to get forked coins. Your statistics cannot be objective in this context.

All motion is not innovation, you've been sold a lie.

Blockstream wants to profit on their control of BTC through private sidechains. Do you really know nothing about Liquid?

There was never a real technical argument for not increasing the block size, they didn't want to increase it only to force people onto 2nd layer solutions which they expect to then profit from.

Segwit isn't some great innovation, it allowed 2nd layers to exist through the malleability fix. You only needed it because of the focus on 2nd layers.

Lightning doesn't do what they claim it can do, it's not going to become some great consumer payment model, and it cannot scale to worldwide use, not without blocksizes larger than 133 megabyte, according to Joseph Poon, the creator of the Lightning concept. 

Do you not even know that much?

&gt; BCH is just raising a limit and re-enabling OP codes. That's not innovation at all. 

BCH is doing all kinds of stuff, just released an uncensorable twitter and built a torrent tracker on it, Lighthouse is being released soon, etc., etc. All those applications people were working on back in 2013 that the Core devs said no to, being built on BCH today.

Did you know the Core devs say not to Vitalik and he built Ethereum? All that value in Ethereum today could've been in BTC, but they told him to get lost.

"I disagree with you there. Size does not correlate importance. While Segwit was the single largest commit ever merged into the Bitcoin repository, it fundamentally altered the protocol in such a way that broke one of the most fundamental properties of what defines Bitcoin.

Following a period of social and technical growth, Bitcoin stagnated to the point that it's tech reached it's breaking point. Rather than address this, Core, even after signing the HK agreement, decided to cobble together an ugly spaghetti monster of a hack that doesn't even increase the blocksize and paves the way for 3rd party scaling solutions and the devs that control them to co-opt Bitcoin.

Segwit was not some spectacular, ground breaking moment in the history of Bitcoin. It was a contentious idea from it's inception that was then repeatedly shoved down the communities throat and heralded as a magical fix all created by code wizards.

Compare the merging of that code with the merging of code that brings the protocol back to where it was prior to a a handful of devs who decided that they knew better than Satoshi. Back to when u/vbuterin wanted to use the Op-codes in the Bitcoin scripting language to build what would later become Ethereum on Bitcoin's blockchain. Back when the protocol had nowhere to grow but up as the blocksize was large enough to facilitate explosive growth in users that has given way to the utility and price gains that Bitcoin has enjoyed time and again prior to blocks becoming full.

"Your narrative is a false one. BTC is actually innovating with Segwit and LN. BCH is just raising a limit and re-enabling OP codes. That's not innovation at all. BTC is not losing network effect ground to BCH, it's actually gaining it. 

You can believe whatever you like but the bottom line is people aren't buying your narrative. If you were right about all this then smart money would be pouring in. Instead it's just the same pump and dump over and over. Volume on and off chain is terrible. Nobody takes BCH seriously because it's frontrun by scammers and inept developers.

"I agree with you that people who ""reason correctly"" can profit from irrational prices and drive the price closer towards its efficient value. However, I believe that in practice there are obstacles to achieving efficient pricing in speculative markets. 

I want to make sure we are on the same page of what the efficient market hypothesis says. 
&gt;The current price is the best bet and unless I employ very smart people and figure out even better predictors than other speculators, the current price is the best proxy for the current value.
The efficient market hypothesis states that given available information the current price is the exact value. Anyone who believes that asset is over or undervalued is plain wrong. In an efficient market, there is no such thing as employing smart people to find undervalued assets. The current market price is already the perfect valuation, and no amount of analysis changes that.

I believe this hypothesis does not always hold for the following two reasons:

*Total Collective Knowledge != Total Market Influence. People may have knowledge of an asset's true value, but are unable to translate that knowledge into market influence. For instance, take your local shitcoin. Even though you and I both know the asset is shit, we are not able to influence its market price directly because no vehicle likely exists to short it. Even if a vehicle did exist, we may not be comfortable with the associated volatility. So even though people as a whole know this asset is worth ~$0, there is an asymmetry in those who actually influence the market, resulting in a &gt;&gt;$0 valuation.

*One Correct Analyst != Efficient Overall Valuation. Just because someone has crunched the numbers and identified the true value of an asset, does not mean that they can single-handedly influence the market price to this correct valuation. Even if you ""knew"" 100% that bitcoins would be worth $50,000 in the future, your impact on the market price is limited by your investment size and acceptable volatility. 

&gt;If nobody ""reasons correctly"", then the price still represents the best we know about the value of the asset.
The price would then represent the weighted-average valuation of all market participants. Average is generally only equal to best if your distribution is symmetrically skewed around the correct valuation. Bitcoin has an extremely skewed distribution in valuations.

"Sure, it's all friendly discussion. Feeling strongly doesn't mean you're angry.

In any case, you nailed the essence of our difference in perspective, IMO: ""...fees \[are a\] bigger problem, then the potential centralization pressure from bigger blocks"".  

That's where I disagree. I believe that decentralization must be non\-negotiable. Without it there is less trust, and less trust means less value. It's perfectly OK if transaction fees are $.25 or $1 or $10, as long as it remains reliable and trustworthy. As the fees come down, it becomes useful for a wider range of business models, but if it is not maximally trustworthy then we already have low\-cost options already.

On\-line or street\-retail payments \(i.e. 'digital cash'\) are already a reality for most people. I have had workable solutions to that need for decades. I \(and most consumers\) would be perfectly fine with using BTC as a funding source for Apple Pay or Google Pay or Paypal or my Amazon account or whatever.

You're just quoting market features. Neither price nor liquidity is not a function of technology. 

Security, let's be honest, both are ultra secure and in no danger of anyone losing funds. 

Hashing power, both have high levels of it, also immaterial.

Both scalability? BTC has none. User experience? BTC utterly fails. You've split your userbase twice, once with segwit and again with lightning.

Are you just purposefully blind to all the critiques of this direction that we have yelled about for years now?

BCH will soon have a network effect that drastically outperforms BTC's, because our protocol is not stagnant, because op-codes were just reintroduced, and because we're committed to scaling on-chain.

Even assuming I'm just tired and missing something here, it still makes less sense to do something like what you're saying just ignoring the 1 being divided by 100,000,000 entirely and having no fractions or decimals to worry about of any kind. If we just used raw Satoshis,

Im also sorry but this is also irrelevant to me too. Does Bitcoin just stop when it reaches a $1 million valuation? 1 Bit will always have a subjective value in fiat until fiat no longer is used to valuate this stuff. That's not really any justification to use ""bits"".

I can take your point about the number of transactions/volume.  I know from personal experience on that one.

These vendors, while not breaking the law (though thru a loophole some might argue) have trouble getting getting Credit  Card companies to approve them because of the future uncertainty of the product they're selling. For at least 3 years before the hard fork 8/1/16, bitcoin was the go to currency. Then towards the end of 2016, with tx fees skyrocketing, vendors turned to other cryptocurrencies like litecoin and ethereum. Of the half dozen, give or take, websites that I looked at, none were offering BCH as a currency. I don't know why. Just an observation. 

Concerning that other subreddit (is it /bitcoin or /Bitcoin ?) , I know I got downvoted on that one because I asked a non- rhetorical question, that I assume others thought was rhetorical. Someone bragged about buying some chutney dip using bitcoin. I asked what the tx fee was (because I had some BTC left in my Blockchain wallet that I wanted to move to GDAX).

"&gt; 32 Mb is not going to cut it. Neither is 1 Gb or 10 Gb. 

[""VisaNet handles an average of 150 million transactions every day and is capable of handling more than 24,000 transactions per second.""](https://usa.visa.com/run-your-business/small-business-tools/retail.html)

150 Million per day is roughly 1,737 TPS. 7 TPS per MB means ~248 MB per block.

Peak of 24,000 that they're capable of is probably for 1 minute during cyber Monday or something.

That is possible with 3.5 GB blocks, but there would probably be less than a handful each year.

&gt; all transactions worldwide: above X 100

With P2P, P2B, B2B, and B2P, 290 billion to 580 billion additional transactions, with 10-20% cash replacement. Estimated 3,430 Billion yearly transactions. [Page 29 of this report, 31 of the PDF.](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Financial%20Services/Our%20Insights/A%20mixed%202015%20for%20the%20global%20payments%20industry/Global-Payments-2016.ashx)

290 Billion per year would require ~1.3 GB blocks. ~9,190 TPS

580 Billion per year would require ~2.7 GB blocks. ~18,379 TPS

~3.4 Trillion per year would require ~15.5 GB blocks. ~108,690 TPS

**So 10 GB blocks would be able to handle roughly two-thirds of all worldwide payments.**

"&gt; What reason is there to do this over just leaving it alone and using single unit Satoshis? Whats the difference between 1 Satoshi or 100 when either still represent a ridiculously tiny fraction of a whole coin? This is pointless.

Satoshi isn't around to explain his decisions, but my feelings are that using two decimal places isn't necessarily an arbitrary number...  Especially considering almost everyone is used to cash denominations with 2 decimal places.  Some very rough calculations and I can see bits (with 2 decimal places) aligns very well with the global money supply.

When Bitcoin hits $1 million USD per Bitcoin, 1 bit = $1 USD.  The market cap of Bitcoin will be $21 trillion.  The global money supply (2017) is [$90.4 trillion](http://money.visualcapitalist.com/worlds-money-markets-one-visualization-2017/).

Also investigations happen into innocent people and accounts get frozen there also.  

3)  right now to have a savings account in Switzerland you have to PAY to keep your money in the bank. The interest rate is negative.  It's super close to zero in Europe and many want it to go negative so everyone has to pay.

They convinced a whole lot of people that Bitcoin would be in danger if the block size were increased above 1MB.  This causes the mempool to fill up beyond what can fit into a 10 minute block every time usage goes up.  This caused transactions to get stuck for hours or even days.  To fix this, the core devs added a feature called Replace By Fee (RBF) so you can resend the same transaction with a higher fee to get it unstuck.  

But do you know what RBF also did?  It broke zero-Conf which had always worked for Bitcoin.  Zero-conf allows you to trust that a transaction in the mempool will be in the next block so that you can have an instant transaction for anything costing less than about 70,000 usd.  Because of RBF, a crook could by a coffee using zero-conf and then use RBF to invalidate that transaction.

And BTC offers crickets and ponzis,1526417099
"&gt; About median fees cares only coin marketing departments. If there are shitty wallets, this does not mean that high fees are necessary. In BCH network we also regulary can see 100,200,300 and even higher fees in sat/byte. This does not mean that tx with 1 sat/b fee will be not included in next block. Same is regarding LTC. 1 sat/byte fee is fully acceptable, because blocks are not full. Do not realy on noobs, relay on real usage. 

Median tx fee is real usage. Also, this:

&gt;Currently, Litecoin‚Äôs minimum transaction and relay fees are set by default to 0.001 LTC/kB. However with the recent increase in Litecoin‚Äôs price, the Litecoin development team has decided to lower them [to]:

&gt;* Minimum transaction fee: 0.0001 LTC/kilobyte


&gt;* Minimum relay fee: 0.00001 LTC/kilobyte

Even the Litecoin devs say you should pay 0.0001 LTC/KB.

&gt; &gt; In terms of security, it would take 24 LTC blocks to equal the security of 6 BCH or BTC blocks
&gt; 
&gt; blah blah blah.. this is not in terms of security, this is in terms of theory. same with tx malleability, which is not fixed on BCH. But risks are soooo low, it is like comparing where we can go by plane - Saturn or Neptune. Actually nowhere. Read my post, i am relaying on 0-confs for years on LTC, never had problem. Or you will hire qualified engineer to hijack tx with tiny amount? Stop kidding yourself. 

That's why I said, it depends on the business/exchange, if you have a problem with how many confirmations they require, take it up with them!

&gt; Have you tried litecoin? A can give you some so you can test yourself.

Yes, before Coinbase/GDAX added BCH I changed my BTG (Bitcoin Gold) to LTC to sell it on GDAX. Which I eventually bought more BCH with.

&gt; Now, lets talk about facts: 
&gt; 
&gt; 1) LTC tx's are [10x cheaper!](https://chain.so/tx/LTC/a98a95f97d9537e4b123fe11b3c046fca438de2efbdc169e6b3f6cb8ee95c030), there's simple math:
&gt; 
&gt; Litecoin: 0.226 kb * 0.00001 LTC/kb * $140 = $0.0003668 in fees
&gt; 
&gt; Bitcoin Cash: 226 bytes * 1 sat/byte / 100,000,000 (divide by this to convert satoshis to BCH) * $1460 = $0.0033 in fees
&gt; 
&gt; I this tx i paid $0.0003668 in fees. 

This says nothing about how many blocks you had to wait in order for your transaction to be accepted by a miner. Miners can reject low fee transactions on any POW Crypto, including LTC, BTC, BCH, etc. The amount you paid on day X really is a moot point, TBH.

&gt; 2) LTC is 4x faster due to block-time. While you can mention 0-confs, it does not make any sense. LTC has 0-conf as well and it is very reliable. But actually you cannot relay on them on any network. Good example are exchanges, for LTC deposit it takes ~15 min, for BCH ~60 min. No one is relaying on 0-conf when there is a need for ultimate payment verification.

There are talks in the BCH community to reduce the blocktime to 2.5 minutes, or have so-called ""weak"" blocks at even shorter intervals, which would make this a moot point also.

&gt; 3) LTC has much larger adoption - popular operating system repositories has litecoin node and wallet included, 

And still over 6 Million BCH addresses hold more than $1 worth of BCH, and 1,798 addresses hold more than 50% of all BCH:

https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin%20cash-addresses.html

But less than 2 Million LTC addresses hold more than $1 of LTC, and only 462 LTC addresses hold more than 57% of all LTC:

https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-litecoin-addresses.html

&gt;there are many merchants accepting litecoin, 

See below.

&gt;there are many development libraries available for working with LTC chain. 

There are many development libraries for BCH too.

&gt;Much more wallet implementations compared to BCH. 

Source?

&gt;Such services as open-source BTCPay Server for payment processing are available for accepting litecoins out of box. 

BCH has Bitpay, Coinbase payments, and MiniPOS, among others.

&gt;And the level of toxity in that community is slightly lower compared to both BTC and BCH. 

All these crypto subs are toxic, it's an inherent ""feature"" of reddit.

I still can't believe Charlie sold all of his LTC then went on to promote NANO during the bubble, which is now near it's YTD lows. I can't imagine how many people lost a lot of money on that scam.

&gt; 4) [Much more merchants compared to BCH!](https://litecoin.com/services#merchants)

62 LTC merchants compared to 589 BCH merchants and growing fast:

"Money should be a medium of exchange but it's used by governments as a medium of control.  

Governments are abusive and limit our rights. History has shown us this over and over.  

Why stop at ‚Ç¨1000?  Why not fully outlaw cash?  That way the big banks can control every transaction you make.  

If they accidentally freeze your account, then of well. Get a lawyer *(happens all the time)*  If Greece or Cyprus happens then oh well, you lose 33% of your money.  Governments need it.  Right?  

If they do negative interest rates and basically tax you just for having money. That's ok too.  

So now that you can't use cash the government has control over what transactions are allow and which ones are not.  When if a tryant comes to power it's much easier for them to control the populous.  Freeze the accounts of his enemies and immediately take strict control and the people will have no means to fight back.

"&gt; 1 ""Bit"" would be 1/1,000,000th of a Bitcoin still. Great, so we're still counting in millionths

I really don't follow your logic at all.  Nobody should ever have to think of a bitcoin as 1/1,000,000th...  That's this format 0.000001.  Bits solves this.  Yes, they are 1/1,000,000th of a Bitcoin but nobody cares if they think of everything in bits.

I think you may be imagining a world where everyone has multiple Bitcoin and they like to think of their wealth in terms of Bitcoin.  The reality is very few people on earth will have multiple Bitcoin if it is adopted as a global currency and even then wallets may have an option to display various units such as Bitcoin or Bits...  Bits being the default.

When it is adopted globally, there will be almost nobody who thinks of what they own in whole units of Bitcoin.  If your rich, you may have several million bits in the bank, otherwise you may have several hundred or several thousand.

You say that bits is an arbitrary denomination, and maybe it is...  Satoshi isn't here to explain his decisions, but doing simple calculations using the M2 money supply for US, which includes cash, deposits, and a few other things, it appears that if Bitcoin took over M2 money supply then 1 bit = 1 dollar (M2) circa 1950's...  so it would make for a very stable dollar/bit with around the same purchasing power as $1 in 1950's.  I'm sure my math is wrong and doesn't take in all the variables, just rough logic to try and determine how it relates to our existing monetary system.

"About median fees cares only coin marketing departments. If there are shitty wallets, this does not mean that high fees are necessary. In BCH network we also regulary can see 100,200,300 and even higher fees in sat/byte. This does not mean that tx with 1 sat/b fee will be not included in next block. Same is regarding LTC. 1 sat/byte fee is fully acceptable, because blocks are not full. Do not realy on noobs, relay on real usage. 

&gt; In terms of security, it would take 24 LTC blocks to equal the security of 6 BCH or BTC blocks

blah blah blah.. this is not in terms of security, this is in terms of theory. same with tx malleability, which is not fixed on BCH. But risks are soooo low, it is like comparing where we can go by plane - Saturn or Neptune. Actually nowhere. Read my post, i am relaying on 0-confs for years on LTC, never had problem. Or you will hire qualified engineer to hijack tx with tiny amount? Stop kidding yourself. 

Have you tried litecoin? A can give you some so you can test yourself.

Now, lets talk about facts: 

1) LTC tx's are [10x cheaper!](https://chain.so/tx/LTC/a98a95f97d9537e4b123fe11b3c046fca438de2efbdc169e6b3f6cb8ee95c030), there's simple math:

Litecoin: 0.226 kb * 0.00001 LTC/kb * $140 = $0.0003668 in fees

Bitcoin Cash: 226 bytes * 1 sat/byte / 100,000,000 (divide by this to convert satoshis to BCH) * $1460 = $0.0033 in fees

I this tx i paid $0.0003668 in fees. 

2) LTC is 4x faster due to block-time. While you can mention 0-confs, it does not make any sense. LTC has 0-conf as well and it is very reliable. But actually you cannot relay on them on any network. Good example are exchanges, for LTC deposit it takes ~15 min, for BCH ~60 min. No one is relaying on 0-conf when there is a need for ultimate payment verification.

3) LTC has much larger adoption - popular operating system repositories has litecoin node and wallet included, there are many merchants accepting litecoin, there are many development libraries available for working with LTC chain. Much more wallet implementations compared to BCH. Such services as open-source BTCPay Server for payment processing are available for accepting litecoins out of box. And the level of toxity in that community is slightly lower compared to both BTC and BCH. 

4) [Much more merchants compared to BCH!](https://litecoin.com/services#merchants)",1526414807

"&gt;In July 2017, approximately 80 to 90 percent of the Bitcoin computing power voted to incorporate Segregated Witness (SegWit, where transactions are split into two segments: transactional data, and signature data), which made it possible to reduce the amount of data being verified in each block. Signature data can account for up to 65 percent of a transaction block, so a change in how signatures are implemented could be useful. When SegWit was activated, it caused a hard fork, and all the mining nodes and users who did not want to change started calling the original Bitcoin blockchain Bitcoin Cash (BCC). Technically, Bitcoin is a fork and Bitcoin Cash is the original blockchain. When the hard fork occurred, people had access to the same
1064 amount of coins on Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.

Operation Mockingbird was an alleged large-scale program of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) that began in the early 1950s and attempted to manipulate news media for propaganda purposes. It funded student and cultural organizations and magazines as front organizations.

According to writer Deborah Davis, Operation Mockingbird recruited leading American journalists into a propaganda network and oversaw the operations of front groups. CIA support of front groups was exposed after a 1967 Ramparts magazine article reported that the National Student Association received funding from the CIA. In the 1970s, Congressional investigations and reports also revealed Agency connections with journalists and civic groups.

Now it's clear there will not be ""one coin to rule them all"" there will be many coins each with it's own specialty.  I get that, and I can't wait to see it unfold..  

BCH may not become the ""one coin"" either, but I think the crypto space will do very well and gain market share consistantly over the next 10 years.    I own some of everything in the top 15 except ripple and LTC.   A raising tide lifts all boats.

"I understand that, so I have avoided posting it here. But there is a very important reason, I do the TA a charge for it. People are using BCH to read and get value from articles and Authors are earning for providing valuable. Prior to any TA articles in [yours.org](https://yours.org), the articles use to earn a few dollars and then to Ryan's surprise, my mentor and TA started posting articles which earned almost $1000 in BCH for a single one.

None of us even realized that there was a demand for it. Of course, his posts and mine include a lot more details than just charts. So for the first time ever there was an awesome result and Ryan even mentioned his post in Satoshi's vision.

The money made from these articles is tiny compared to my role as speculator, but it sends out a very strong message out to the BTC world about a real word success story via yours.org\+BCH . I take ample opportunity \(tweet\) to prove to the BTC supporters/trolls about the real value of both these platforms. I'm always greeted by silence

"You're not seeing how creating a 100 satoshi denomination doesn't change the root of the problem. 1 ""Bit"" would be 1/1,000,000th of a Bitcoin still. Great, so we're still counting in millionths, still an incomprehensible division for most people, how is this helpful?

Why not instead just eliminate the decimal fractions entirely and count upward in Satoshis, and just use that the same way we use whole Dollars? This is equally not difficult to display on wallets and far less confusing than any expectation of the mass of society trying to count in millionths.

"&gt; SegWit reduces the memory cost of signature data by ~75%,

It does not. All this talk about 'reduction' is just an accounting trick! Memory usage, and 'over-the-wire' is not reduced.

The 'saving' Jimmy is talking about, are only when segwit transactions are sent to old, non-upgraded, non-segwit nodes.
Old, non-segwit nodes, do not understand this new tx signatures, so they do not request it, but all other nodes, if they want to validate, must download the segwit signatures. And I think there is almost no non-segwit nodes running anymore.

In short, segwit is no reduction in size, bandwidth, or memory usage. It is an accounting trick (weight units), so old nodes are not pushed off the network, even if they can not validate in full anymore. Bizarre, IMO.

About new servers, look the data of the Gigablock Experiment, a home gaming hardware can process 500 tps now, with software optimizations up to 1000 tps. That would be more than modest increase in block size, that's over 100MB blocks. More than we will need in any time soon.

My 8 years old PC processed full 8MB blocks in about 2 seconds. I'm looking forward to see how it will be with 32MB blocks, if there were any.

But, in my opinion, running a world-wide payment network on an 8 years old, left over, desktop PC, is an unrealistic expectation.

No one doubts that Ethereum is almost guaranteed returns. But the big money is to be made elsewhere, the ship has already sailed in a big way.

"LTC also has working, instant 0-conf. Stop pulling arguments from your ass. Stop these conspiracy theories, lets talk about facts:

1) LTC tx's are [10x cheaper!](https://chain.so/tx/LTC/a98a95f97d9537e4b123fe11b3c046fca438de2efbdc169e6b3f6cb8ee95c030), there's simple math:

Litecoin: 0.226 kb * 0.00001 LTC/kb * $140 = $0.0003668 in fees

Bitcoin Cash: 226 bytes * 1 sat/byte / 100,000,000 (divide by this to convert satoshis to BCH) * $1460 = $0.0033 in fees

I this tx i paid $0.0003668 in fees. 

2) LTC is 4x faster due to block-time. While you can mention 0-confs, it does not make any sense. LTC has 0-conf as well and it is very reliable. But actually you cannot relay on them on any network. Good example are exchanges, for LTC deposit it takes ~15 min, for BCH ~60 min. No one is relaying on 0-conf when there is a need for ultimate payment verification.

3) LTC has much larger adoption - popular operating system repositories has litecoin node and wallet included, there are many merchants accepting litecoin, there are many development libraries available for working with LTC chain. Much more wallet implementations compared to BCH. Such services as open-source BTCPay Server for payment processing are available for accepting litecoins out of box. And the level of toxity in that community is slightly lower compared to both BTC and BCH.

Over time ASIC chips will likely become efficient enough that mining farms don't need to consume enough electricity to power a city, and also there is [work](http://news.berkeley.edu/2018/04/16/thin-film-converts-heat-from-electronics-into-energy/) being done on materials that can convert heat energy back into usable electricity, which with enough efficiency could completely change mining. 

The reason for a variable mining difficulty is so that the network can adapt for rising and declining levels of hashrate. If enough miners switch networks, then BTC does lose security, but miners will have less work to do to mine the network. 

It's almost certain that tx fees will have to increase to offset miner costs, but scaling solutions (segwit, LN, shnorr, etc.) should mitigate this somewhat for individual users.

Overall I think that if BTC does survive long after mining reward elimination, it will be primarily at the cost of network security. Of course if enough people decide the network is unusable, hard forking to a network where block rewards continue is possible, but would cause a huge rift in the BTC community, and would kill BTC's deflationary charisteristics",1526411332

It _is not_ a significant change to the conceptual model of coins-as-a-chain-of-digital-signatures. It is _far less_ of a change than Satoshi's implementation of programmable predicates vs the direct-signature model presented in the whitepaper.

Is Segwit a significant enough change that it should be closely examined? _No question!_ Having performed that examination, is it so drastic a change that it justifies forking if the majority consensus approves it? Not at all, in my opinion, but the minority is free to do so if they choose.

&gt;I am asking for your answer, it is not a trap and I see no reason to be defensive about that.

I'm only being defensive of my time spent in this discussion. It doesn't appear as though we're making much progress toward a mutual understanding. While I'm more than happy to answer questions, it's not as if I'm some defender of BTC or the Core implementation. You've presented things time and again as a contrast of BTC and BCH. _Both have made changes, neither is automatically more justified than the other, they must stand on their own merits, and both have the potential to be wrong._ ",1526410796

"Thanks for that last link, I actually learned something new today.

I think the scenario dubbed a feather fork is interesting and worth considering, but not something that couldn't be avoided by a hard fork. It strikes me as a more roundabout way of doing a contentious hard fork: the attacker has to broadcast their intent and target in order to be successful, with the expectation that other miners will find it more profitable to follow along. In the event that altruistic nodes start rejecting blocks verified by the attacker, a hard fork would occur, leaving the attacker with a worthless (or at least much less profitable) alt chain. This altruistic nodes solution could be implemented as an update to the Bitcoin Core client. In the end, the attacker would be better off just cutting out the middle part and going for a chain split, without explicitly exposing themselves as a malicious entity. See Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin Gold, etc.",1526410773

"&gt; But at least it doesn't change how Bitcoin works on a fundamental level.

Actually it kind of does. Before cashaddr, all BCH wallets were able to read addresses created by all other wallets. Now, not all wallets can read the addresses of other wallets. If you generate a cashaddr address, only other wallets that support cashaddr (which are currently not the majority) can make a payment.

Contrast this to email, where all email clients are compatible with all other clients. In my opinion, the reason why email caught on is because it was understandable by regular people. You don't have to be a computer wizard to figure out how to send an email.

With BCH it's turning into a situation where you have to be a computer wizard to figure out how to make an address that your friend's wallet can understand. Me and you may be knowledgeable enough to figure out how to convert an address encoding, but your average person does not want to mess with that. They'd much rather use a coin like Dash that uses a single unified address format across all wallets.",1526410624

"he's become seriously unhinged:

gypsytoy: *I don‚Äôt seem to be coming back. I basically have the same story as OP except that I went from investing everything I had (as a college student) to buy 60 BTC in 2013 and holding strong for a solid 4 years. Then having a mental health crisis during 2016 and giving 20 BTC away to strangers online who took advantage of me, never to be seen again. Then in December, days before the top, I learned what margin trading actually was. Mad a tiny bit. Lost a good amount while falling asleep during a drop and then chasing the whole thing (40 BTC) down to 0.02 BTC.

I‚Äôm beyond devastated. I‚Äôm confident that I‚Äôm going to end my life over this and I‚Äôve already begun separating myself from the world and getting my affairs in order. I feel weird revealing and admitting this on reddit, but this post hits home, as does the one of the main sub about the guy‚Äôs brother who killed himself over the same situation. I admire those who can weather setbacks of this kind but I‚Äôm not one of them. I knew from the minute I read the white paper that Bitcoin was a game changing idea. I poured my savings into it, confident that my stack would be worth a million (20K) within 5 years (I called this almost perfectly). It‚Äôs not even like I want to live an extravagant lifestyle, I just wanted to feel financially safe for once in my life and wanted to share the wealth with those close to me and help build positive businesses and a better world. The pump and dumpers and Lamborghini memes are so obnoxious, as if the world needs any more mindless hedonistic consumerism. I grew up pretty poor and bounced from foster home to foster home and from school to school. I barely made it through college and have no marketable skills. I lost my dead end sales job a few months back and can‚Äôt bring myself to go back to barely getting buy. I held strong throughout the years, even though I could‚Äôve certainly used the money at times. I always brought my own lunch to work and always took the subway when I could instead of paying for Uber. I invested a few thousand dollars back in 2013 and never saw a penny of it. OP is much more honorable than me because I certainly don‚Äôt have the self respect to turn down donations but I‚Äôm also pretty certain that people aren‚Äôt donating to the small army of people who are in the same situation and I obviously don‚Äôt deserve it anyway. When I run into friends, they always ask about how well I must be doing because they know I‚Äôve been a Bitcoin proponent for a long time. Smiling and looking at them in the eye while talking positively about Bitcoin is incredibly taxing and I immediately want to throw up in the nearest trash can afterwards. I know somewhere else in the universe, there‚Äôs a ‚Äòme‚Äô who decided against margin trading or stopped after a few losses or didn‚Äôt start playing bull at the beginning of a bear market. Not me though, I‚Äôm a fool and I squandered the only thing going for me in life. I hope others heed the warnings, but I know most won‚Äôt. Either way, I don‚Äôt have the type of mind to let something like this go and I can‚Äôt stand to watch Bitcoin moon again and be left behind. It‚Äôs sad that money can have such power over people. I know many have had their lives dramatically changed for the better but I suppose there are two sides to the coin. I don‚Äôt even know why I still obsess over Bitcoin and this sub. I literally can‚Äôt think of anything else most of the time. I guess I keep hoping that it will drop to some very low amount and that I‚Äôll be able to buy back in but that doesn‚Äôt make sense because I don‚Äôt have $10 to my name to put back in. I‚Äôm going to lose my unemployment benefits and housing in a few months and really have nowhere to turn once that happens. I know most people would pull themselves up by their bootstraps and carry on but I know that I could never escape my mind. Sorry to rant negatively on your kind and reasoned comment. I wish OP the best and he seems to have a much better attitude towards the ordeal than I do, even with the stakes being that much higher. edit: I mostly regret posting this. I sort of figured it would get buried, didn‚Äôt realize that this thread was still pretty active and that I posted on the top comment. Thanks for the comments, PMs and kind words. I‚Äôm not in immediate danger of anything and wasn‚Äôt trying to start a pity party for myself. Nonetheless, thank you all for your concern.*

&gt; Make a better solution for crypto that works because blockchain is an extremely poor database! I don't believe that statement btw, that is your argument.  
  

Yes it is.  A lot of people are trying to make better tech than blockchains.  They've all failed imo, but people are trying.  
  

&gt; And blockchain is getting more usable through design and innovation. Perhaps an issue is that the term blockchain is being coopted into something that is less and less of an actual blockchain.  
  

Exactly, and you just did that.  People call anything that's distributed, or that uses cryptography ""blockchain"" when it is not.  a blockchain is the database used in bitcoin and eth.  if you want to protect the integrity of shipping containers then you don't need a blockchain, you need cryptography and you can use mysql as the database.",1526410115

If you don't see the pitch you missing the boat.   Your not a merchant so you don't see the advantage. 

The statement BCH is making is a sales pitch to merchants.  

Merchant adoption is key.  

This sales pitch is totally overlooked by small blockers and I think it's laughable.   Clear misunderstanding of economics.

What I have seen in crypto is that there are occasions where TA patterns apply 100%. The bull pennants I have been able to identify as such have always broken upwards as if on cue.

The things that do hold me back from relying on TA for crypto are:

- Market caps very low; lead to volatility: I personally know two people who could conceivably cause a short term crash if they sold their crypto. They're rich, but not ""hundred-millionaire"". A single crypto fund can significantly move the price here, something very unlikely in stocks (unless you're Carl Icahn on a personal crusade or the like)

- Market doesn't shut down: crypto movements in Japan will move the market while Europe is asleep, and so forth.

- No established ""rules"" regarding big players: in stocks, you have quarterly earnings reports as dates/events to watch out for. In forex, you have decisions from central banks. In crypto, it feels as though every week brings some sort of reason to panic (""load ze Korea FUD"" has quite a bit of truth to it). Also, regular rules don't apply, ex: order spoofing is common.

"well now I can't give you the satisfaction of saying Touche again,,   shit I just did,  

Anyhow I think we agree more than we disagree.  I'm not saying I don't see the merits of gold,, but calling bitcoin (and by bitcoin I mean BCH) digital gold is not correct because the two, as you have pointed out, are very different.  

I like metals,  silver mostly,  and I don't hold 100% of my investments in bitcoin for the reasons you mentioned. 

But again,  calling bitcoin digital gold is misleading.  Especially to those who understand neither.   

Bitcoin is not digital gold,  just like my toaster is not a dishwasher.  They have many things in common but they are designed to do different things.  Bitcoin is designed to do things gold will never do.

Shameless plugs to goldmoney aside, I have clearly (and you have helped) pointed out that calling bitcoin digital gold is wrong and misleading.  

Compared to gold bitcoin is much more useful, cheaper to move and secure and also acts as a ""world ledger for anything"" rather than just a ledger of ""who has spending power"" like gold does.

"&gt; It's that gold, in general, is a viable competing money, and that using *any* good digitized gold redemption service is one of the things that makes it even more viable today.

i tend not to think in terms of multiple viable monies scattered across the world today.  in fact, we really only have one world reserve currency, the dollar, so that is what i am talking about.  i agree with all your concerns an qualms with the dollar.  there is no disagreement there.  we only seem to be disagreeing with gold vs Bitcoin, esp for the future.

&gt;But in aggregate, gold storage and gold redemption, as a category, is not centralized. 

but it is.  in central bank vaults as in the Comex and LBMA.  similarly in GM.  these are centralized points of failure and depositing your gold bullion into these entities is a recipe for disaster.  just look at the farce the Comex has become in not being able to get gold out due to fractional reserving.  so even while it serving as a digital gold money thru GM, it can disappear or be shutdown via state intervention at any time.   that can't happen with Bitcoin.  

&gt;Your arguments here against GoldMoney could easily apply to fiat banking, and so the logic you have presented demands that dollars are also ""not money"". 

agreed.  i would argue just that.

&gt;The problem with Bitcoin at this time is that it is not a great unit of account, or store of value. 

i agree with it's not a uoa; yet.  but i strongly disagree that it's not a sov.  what do you expect?  instant adoption across the world on Jan 9, 2009 when the code was released?  of course not, this is a process of slowly over the years demonstrating that Bitcoin is indeed a great sov.  imo, it has achieved that in spades; just look at the prices of both BTC &amp; BCH and where they've gone before the pullback.  far outpacing gold and for very good and identifiable reasons.  this is b/c we now have a good idea about what makes a good sound money; the 3 std defns uoa, moe, sov but also new digital categories such as speed, cryptographically secure, PoW, low fees, 0 conf, all which allow this new, revolutionary form of money to function ON THE INTERNET free from hackers.  GM can't come close to ensuring that as they have centralized servers, 6 to be exact, that could easily be seized.  miners, otoh, exist in the probably tens to hundreds of thousands, if you incl individual hashers that connect to pools.  all these guys serve to preserve the ledger and add PoW to Bitcoin's security.  

&gt;Wildly oscillating in price (even upwards) is NOT ""storing value"". Because it cannot predictably store value compared to other alternatives, it cannot function as a unit of account, so it cannot currently make for great money.

again, why would you think a nascent new form of money would be stable from day1?  make no sense.  even now we're seeing a steady reliable decrease in the volatility and % pullbacks compared to the past.  this one only went down 60% whereas in the past we've had 90%+ pullbacks.  this only makes sense as we see a greater number of institutions just now beginning to participate and contribute liquidity as they come to the table kicking and screaming.  they now realize they have no choice.  but it's taken them 9y to realize this.  so again, you expect stable price from day 1?  what are you talking about?

&gt;But it is‚Äîat least currently‚Äîa less bad store of value and unit of account than Bitcoin. 

you're trying to associate one truth with an untruth.  of course Bitcoin is not yet a uoa. but i strongly disagree that it is a poor sov.  look at it's price today even after the pullback.  way up vs 9y ago.  early adopters not only have seen sov, they've seen fantastic appreciation.  are you kidding me?

&gt;Again: **Going up =/= Storing value**. This is important to recognize.

lol, i just think that's a crazy statement with which most Bitcoiner's who've been in since the early days would agree with me.

&gt;To be fair, the problem with gold is that if you want lighting-fast, effectively free digital payments you need a custodian of some kind to help facilitate that with some small portion of your liquid wealth. But when it comes to storing value or being a unit of account, it is objectively better than both dollars and Bitcoin at the present time.

the fact you have to depend on a centralized service to try and call it money is illogical.

&gt;I also have some wealth that I keep in BCH, but its value fluctuates wildly compared to gold and other assets I hold. BCH is not really ""storing value"" for me. But it can and does allow me to cash out speculative gains that I can put back into a more stable store of value from time to time.

this is only if you are obsessed with price in the short term.  over the long term, these swings even out with a progressive rise in price.  yours is not an argument against BCH being a sov.  we're in a bootstrapping phase furchrisakes.

"&gt;Thank you for taking the time to give me your feedback. 
&gt;
&gt;1.  This was added for future compatibility.  160bits is nearly insecure at this moment in time for multisig wallets.

This is not how multisig works.  P2SH multisig bundles all the addresses up into a single 160 bit hash, which has the same collision resistence as a regular single key p2pkh.  There's no more or no less security from a different transaction type or from more keys in multisig.  

If you believe that 160 bits is at risk of some kind of attack *regardless* of the transaction type, then id like to see some data to support that, so that all other cryptos can support it.

Considering that no scriptPubKey checksig opcode can currently generate hashes larger than 160 bits, so the scripting language itself wpuld have to be extended to meaningfully use this feature, it counts as overengineered yes.

&gt;
&gt;2. Then omit it from your url.  It is optional.

Then servers have to implement new validation logic in their url handlers to allow for both regardless.  Which is a lot of maintainer effort that could be spent on better integrations in other ways.


&gt;
&gt;3. This is a technical problem?

Yes.  The address standard was supposed to make QR codes smaller.  It failed to do so.  That's a problem with the standard.
&gt;
&gt;4. No, it should be specified as a hyperlink with a URI handler.  You shouldnt' need to copy and paste. 

Thank God every platform and every wallet is the same and correctly handles all uris and intents and nobody has multiple wallets and nobody uses web wallets or needs to paste addresses into forms or send them to their friends or clients.

&gt;However, the prefix can be omitted so it's fine.

If the solution is always to not use the prefix, why does the spec have it?   Sadism?  Make more work for maintainers and confusion for users for fun?

&gt;
&gt;5. Then don't prfix it.

See above.

More importantly the code still has to be there in order to handle the case where the *user* prefixes it.  If they do (or you do) then code like `uri=""bitcoin:%s?amount=%d"" % (addr,amount)` is now *broken*.    The fix is simple, but breaking legacy code because you don't give a fuck and think it looks cool is *terrible* for adoption and is shoddy engineering.

If the solution is to never prefix then the prefix shouldn't be in the standard.

&gt;
&gt;6. Why are you storing a byte field as a character field in your DB?

Im not doing it, but hypothetical coinbase engineer me is doing it because its smaller and faster and it fits better in cache and im a bad programmer.  Why are you introducing subtle bugs into legacy codebases if you want me to support your coin?

&gt;
&gt;7. This is simply not true.  There is example code for calculating the BCH code in multiple languages.  I personally implemented it for Electron Cash, cashaddr.bitcoincash.org, and helped with the implementation in Bitcon-ABC.

I didn't say there were not more implementations.  I said implementing prefix discovery is nontrivial.  

Prove me wrong: Here's a valid cashaddr with the prefix stripped.  See if you can find the prefix.  Bonus points if you can do it without computing multiple checksums.

qpm2qsznhks23z7629mms6s4cwef74vcwvgkvxqnnv

&gt;
&gt;8. This is why the spec says not to do it.  The proper UX would be to highlight the incorrect characters for the user.

Between a cryptographic primitive that allows a vulnerability to lose funds but has document begging the implementer not to use it and a cryptographic primitive that does not have that vulnerability, which one would you prefer?  (See also the sony ecdsa hack)

Also, if BCH weren't just a profiteering machine for Craig Wright, Jihan Wu, and Roger Ver, and the early ones brainwashed into buying as the price of it plummeted and stand to profit the most by talking it up, MAYBE... just MAYBE I'd like it.

"Thanks for an actual answer instead of just down-voting like others did.

I think rationality has little relevance in the efficient market hypothesis. Take this criticism from wikipedia:

&gt; Investors, including the likes of Warren Buffett,[39] and researchers have disputed the efficient-market hypothesis both empirically and theoretically. Behavioral economists attribute the imperfections in financial markets to a combination of cognitive biases such as overconfidence, overreaction, representative bias, information bias, and various other predictable human errors in reasoning and information processing. These have been researched by psychologists such as Daniel Kahneman, Amos Tversky, Richard Thaler, and Paul Slovic. These errors in reasoning lead most investors to avoid value stocks and buy growth stocks at expensive prices, which allow those who reason correctly to profit from bargains in neglected value stocks and the overreacted selling of growth stocks.

How does this not directly confirm the theory? As long as there are last mentioned investors who ""reason correctly"" to profit, they do and move the price contrary to what others think. If nobody ""reasons correctly"", then the price still represents the best we know about the value of the asset.

Ok, maybe you might bet on falling prices short term even if you see a higher value long term according to the old saying ""*Markets can remain irrational a lot longer than you and I can remain solvent.*"" but then again, how is the falling price any different than the value? The actor anticipates a falling price because he anticipates that others will value it less in the short term future.

If you ask me what I think the right USD value of BTC is, I would say ""infinite"" as I think Bitcoin will survive the USD the current price reflects the probability of this actually happening and it's short- and long term probability of materializing. The current price is the best bet and unless I employ very smart people and figure out even better predictors than other speculators, the current price is the best proxy for the current value. Not for the future value. For the value of now and the very immediate future.",1526406544

Operation Mockingbird was an alleged large-scale program of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) that began in the early 1950s and attempted to manipulate news media for propaganda purposes. It funded student and cultural organizations and magazines as front organizations.

According to writer Deborah Davis, Operation Mockingbird recruited leading American journalists into a propaganda network and oversaw the operations of front groups. CIA support of front groups was exposed after a 1967 Ramparts magazine article reported that the National Student Association received funding from the CIA. In the 1970s, Congressional investigations and reports also revealed Agency connections with journalists and civic groups.

"&gt; Bitcoin confirmation can take up to a few days

Article was written today, not 7 months ago. Bitcoin confirmations take nowhere near a few days. ",1526404442
"It's not that GoldMoney is a viable competing digital money to Bitcoin. It's that gold, *in general*, is a viable competing money, and that using \*any\* good digitized gold redemption service is one of the things that makes it even more viable today.

It is true that any one specific gold storage and redemption service is centralized. But in aggregate, gold storage and gold redemption, as a category, is *not centralized.* There are many competing services one can use, keeping prices low and quality high. This will only increasingly become the case as time goes on.

Your arguments here against GoldMoney could easily apply to fiat banking, and so the logic you have presented demands that dollars are also ""not money"". I don't think that's a great way to think about it. I think that dollars are far less good at being money than gold, but I'm not sure it's best to say they are ""not money"". Dollars are just ""not great money"". Though I guess that's a semantic distinction.

My definition of money is the same as yours I'm sure. The problem with Bitcoin at this time is that it is not a great unit of account, or store of value. 

Wildly oscillating in price \(even upwards\) is NOT ""storing value"". Because it cannot predictably store value compared to other alternatives, it cannot function as a unit of account, so it cannot currently make for great money.

The problem with the dollar is \*also\* that it is not a great store of value or unit of account. But it is‚Äîat least currently‚Äîa *less bad* store of value and unit of account than Bitcoin. I hate to admit that, because I prefer BCH to dollars, but it is objectively true.

If the dollar slowly drops 2&amp;#37; and Bitcoin widely rockets up 100&amp;#37; in the same timeframe, with 50&amp;#37; dips in\-between, then the dollar, within that timeframe, is the better store of value. Therefore it makes for the better unit of account. 

You know that to be true. For instance, you could sanely enter a loan or contract denominated in dollars, but not in Bitcoin. So Bitcoin is not yet ""as good"" money as the dollar. But maybe some day! I sure hope so. We have a lot of work to do! Let's do it.

Again: \*\*Going up =/= Storing value\*\*. This is important to recognize.

To be fair, the problem with gold is that if you want lighting\-fast, effectively free digital payments you need a custodian of some kind to help facilitate that with some small portion of your liquid wealth. But when it comes to storing value or being a unit of account, it is objectively better than both dollars and Bitcoin at the present time.

One potential workaround is to only store a small portion of your wealth with a custodian \(the part you plan to spend within a month or more\). Or, you can occasionally cash out a small portion of your gold and other assets into something like BCH, so you have it available to spend, while not risking all your wealth to BCH's current volatility. \(I do both.\)

I also have some wealth that I keep  in BCH, but its value fluctuates wildly compared to gold and other assets I hold. BCH is not really ""storing value"" for me. But it can and does allow me to cash out speculative gains that I can put back into a more stable store of value from time to time. 

\*That\* kind of activity, interestingly enough, is the only kind of thing that can potentially help stabilize Bitcoin's price over the long term. If people do it enough, who knows? Maybe someday it could become a stable store of value. But that day is not today. Whether it ever comes remains to be seem. I hope it does.",1526404427

"it takes a few days between bank because they dont trust eachother, thats why there are fee's and why it takes so long - even in this era of technology. Dont forget - these are banks that are unknown to eachother, they both reside in different countries and use different currencies.
 
Ripple is changing that with xRapid! No the liquidity it not an issue, regulations should be fine - you will probably notice them talking about xrp during the next G20 in July - but thats speculation. The real reason why regulations are not an issue is that a bank isnt required to hold XRP themselves to be able to use xRapid, they can purchase XRP directly just for the transaction or they use use a related company that sits in a country where it is allowed to hold cryptocurrencies and use that to store XRP. You can even think of businessmodels, where banks that are allowed to hold crypto will determine on each transaction if they will use their own XRP for it or directly purchase the XRP needed for the transaction, either way they are not at risk this way - neither is the customer, even on volatility, as the swap happens in mere seconds and the only party that takes the risk is the marketmaker. The marketmaker can be the bank, with risks comes rewards, but can be anyone in the world for that matter. 
 
all of ripples products use XRPL, and this enables them to trade any currency, any digital asset, at any time. xRapid finds the cheapest marketmaker around on all exchanges to purchase XRP and does the same when exchanging for the desired currency. 
 
Another thing xRapid solves for banks is that banks no longer need to 'hold' foreign dorment currencies they have waiting for when a customer needs it. With xRapid, they will have access to liquidity of every currency in seconds.",1526403305

"&gt;\-\-\-With respect, you seem to have limited familiarity with how gold has worked as money throughout history.  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm completely familiar with everything you just said. The point is that a gold note transaction is a note transaction not a gold transaction.

Ah, so then you already know that gold based transactions are gold based transactions, just as dollar based transactions are dollar based transactions. Good!

...And you already know that you don't need to fly gold bars around to have a wonderfully effective and practical monetary system that can support all of global commerce, sustainably, with tremendous transparency and at extremely low cost. \(Until governments try to take it over that is, mostly by affecting and leveraging public opinion, just as they very likely will with Bitcoin....and possibly have already.\)

So then why are we arguing then? Just over semantics?

I think BCH is wonderful too, and has its own unique strengths and weaknesses. One great strength is that you don't need a *specific and singular* third party involved to send value to someone instantly. Obviously.

A few of its weaknesses however, are that it does not have a clear path to the price stability of gold, it doesn't work when the lights go out, and it is not perfectly fungible at this time.

They are complimentary assets as things stand. I don't know why one needs to disparage one or the other or pretend that either is a completely perfect substitute for the other. They have their own pros and cons. To not acknowledge *both* is to be dogmatic and spread ""propaganda"", in the literal sense of the term.

&gt;People don't go flying gold bars around for every transaction, and never have.  
&gt;

For the record, that doesn't apply to _me_. I have consistently supported a blocksize increase.

I didn't answer because the question is imprecise. By whar measure of significance am I expected to judge? No matter what I answer, it can be reasoned away - or at least hand-waved. At best it starts an endless cycle of debate over what is significant or opinion on expectations. Those are all fine discussions to have, but best when taken in their own context.

I'm not your enemy. I have no grudge or ill-will toward BCH. I think the animosity toward Segwit and RBF is short-sighted and the arguments against them technically flawed.

"&gt;Who is the ""market""?

Well, all of us. The market is just a label for the combined effect of millions of individual actors making decisions in the form of choosing to accept (or not) / buy (or not) / sell (or not) the coins on one chain or the other.

&gt;And how can the market ""value"" different sides of a coin in a split?

Again, it's the decisions of millions of individual actors choosing how much value to place on each side of a split.  BCH and BTC are the result of a chain split and they are trading as, and being priced by the market as, separate assets.

&gt;You do have a saying if you run a full node.

Running a non-mining so-called ""full node"" isn't what gives you a saying. I've bought and/or sold both BTC and BCH post-split, thereby contributing to the price discovery of each, without running a ""full node"" for either.  *That's* whats given me a ""say.""

&gt;But fact is, full nodes, mining as non-mining, *are* the market forces at play.

Well *mining* nodes obviously represent market forces but no, I don't think you can say the same of non-mining ""nodes."" It's investors / important economic actors that incentivize miners to create one or more chains that follow certain rules. Some economic actors have more influence than others (and some of them may happen run to ""full nodes""). But it's their status as important economic actors that's important. It's absolutely NOT that nodes qua nodes have much (if any) influence. You could modify your own ""full node"" to begin rejecting any blocks larger than 300 kb. And guess what would happen? Your ""full node"" would grind to a halt and no one would give a shit.

"It's a guide.  Like anything else.  Yes, paying attention to indicators works because most of the people who make continual money on Crypto use TA as a guide. 

You don't need sophisticated models and it isn't magic.  It's just paying attention to a few indicators that are fairly accurate predictors of people's behavior. 

I've been going to this sub for a year.  And I watch people react extremely predictably to the same events.  Panic and sell at dips, FOMO in from word of mouth.

If people can be counted on to act predictably, than TA indicators can be counted on to foretell a high probability of a certain event. 

TA isn't perfect.  You need to constantly monitor the context behind what you're seeing to determine whether what's happening is anomalous, or routine ups and downs. 

If a coin is falling - have they just been hacked and compromised, leading to severe doubts about the future of the coin?  TA won't help you with that. 

But is it just falling because it's overbought and the buyers market is saturated, predicting a decline?  

Context always goes hand in hand with TA.  And TA is never a magic bullet allowing people to perfectly predict the future, because again, you can't predict future context, and therefore there is always unpredictability.  

But it helps. 

A pilot flies by constantly relying on his training and understanding of his plane, but he also uses gauges that tell him information that, though by itself won't allow him to fly the plane without his training and wisdom, help him make better and more informed decisions.

"Technically bitcoin isn‚Äôt deflationary, it‚Äôs still slightly inflationary and will reach 0% when the last coin is mined. To all intents and purposes though it is deflationary because supply and demand causes (over a large period) the trend to only ever go up.

"I personally don't like the term ""bits"" because it already has a use in computing. ""kbit"" is additionally confusing, and there are even suggestions of referring to 1 mBTC as ""millibit"", which is another world of confusion because it's inverting the nature of ""mili"" as an SI prefix, whereas 1mBTC is pretty clear what it means. I also don't really see the need for having a ""bit"" terminology. The distinct unit of currency is the satoshi and we don't necessarily need additional denominations. Many countries only have a single unit of currency, such as they Yen or Dong. (Historically they had smaller units, but inflation has driven them out of circulation).

At 1BTC = ~10,000 USD, A Dong is approximately half a satoshi, but the minimum note in circulation is 200 Dong, making 100 sats the minimum unit of exchange at the current price value. Also a Won is approximately 10 sats, a Yen is approximately 100 sats, and 3 Kuwaiti dinar are ~1Msat. Of course, these magnitudes could change because Bitcoin still has room to grow between 100-1000x what it's currently valued at.

We should refer to things in satoshi, or sat for short, and we should use internationally recognized prefixes for magnitudes ksat, Msat to refer to them formally (being careful to properly capitalize the M, as msat is common terminology in the Lightning Network).

But colloquially, it doesn't make sense for every country to refer to the same magnitude of currency, as their national currencies have distinct magnitudes which they are familiar with, and having to convert magnitudes is an extra burden. Some languages also do not think in the same orders of magnitude (powers of 3), because they have distinct words for 10,000. In Japanese, 1 man sat = 10,000 sats, and a million is a ""hyaku man"" (1 hundred ten-thsouands), and an ""oku sat"" would be 1 BTC. They'd also pronounce Sat as either ""sato"" or ""satto"", despite it originating from a Japanese name, the western abbreviation of it is not pronounceable to them in the same way.

So my opinion is that each country choose where to stick the decimal point in Bitcoin in order to make the conversion to their national currency within an order of magnitude, and should pick a distinct name to refer to that magnitude of currency, such that there can be many names to refer to the same unit, but formally, we can easily do the conversion using SI prefixes.

0.0001 BTC, or 100ksat, has been fairly close to units of USD, EUR, GBP, RMB at current prices for a while and should probably have a distinct name besides referring to it in hundreds of bits, microbitcoins or hundreds of ksat.",1526402344

"&gt;Because it's not because someone thought of the idea, like you pretended I said. It's because pay to surf has been tried and failed.

Oh really, that is the part you want to go back on? Ok, then, let me rephrase that:  The fact that some idea was tried and failed before doesn't mean it's bad. I don't really see the difference here... You seem to be creating another straw argument here, by making it about one single word that doesn't really matter to begin with. 

\&gt; That part isn't a business model; literally any cryptocurrency can support that. It doesn't require your token. 

I don't think bitcoin could honestly. Additionally, brave/BAT is creating the software around it, nobody else is. It does require something. And since nobody is doing that something, the other cryptos can't do that right now. 

\&gt;  There are adblockers that handle it better too. What's stopping anyone from including Brave's filter lists? 

Nothing. It is open source.... What is your point here even? The browser does it job. It blocks ads. Why use their filter list if you could just use their browser? 

\&gt;  I'm a long time bitcoiner who actually does use alts on occasion, which is why I've seen hundreds of scams just like yours. But my experience is irrelevant, this is about Brave/BAT. 

No this is about how brave blocks popups and ads. You made a straw argument on BAT or pay to surf. 

\&gt;  ""This time it's different"" doesn't help if the underlying arms race problem remains. 

This is your only actual valid point, on the strawman side of the argument that is \(I was talking about brave and how it blocks ads, remember?\). This is a concern of myself as well, and I am eager to learn how BAT is planning to solve this. I think that one obvious solution would be to make ads give very very little money, which should be fine since you get 0 now. 

\&gt;  No it's not. It was 100&amp;#37; pre\-mined and runs on Ethereum. 

Lol oh god here we go. Ethereum has been shown to be more decentralized than btc numerous times. But lets not go there. Lets agree to disagree there. We all know going into that further will get me banned here. \(yes I hold eth, but also btc\). premine doesn't mean a system can not be decentralized. I don't know where you got that idea. 

\&gt;   Are you talking about the free rider donations? Literally any other cryptocurrency can do that.  

No, for example I can pay a &amp;#37; of the time I visit one youtuber in brave a &amp;#37; of my monthly donations. No other crypto has that function. Also, ltc can do everything btc can, but still btc is the better investment. The fact that another crypto can do something, doesn't mean it can do it better, or that it is more valuable. 

\&gt;  I appreciate that *now* you've at least tried, but those differences aren't accurate and don't solve the problems that made it unviable last time. 

Please provide arguments on why they are not accurate. Stating they are not accurate without any meaningful argumentation is utterly useless. 

About your \*now\*... You are a really sad debater honestly. You come up with a strawman argument when I talk about the amazing ad blockin capabilities of brave. And then attack me because I didn't foresee your argument on pay to surf? Wut bro? Like you even tried with your ""bat is premined and on Ethereum"" comment. Or your ""shameful strawman attack because I used the word ""thought instead of ""tried"""". 

\&gt;  I'm talking about both because Brave depends on BAT, and they make their advertising revenue from Brave's users. But please, continue your discovery of what a strawman argument means. 

It really doesn't. I don't use any BAT. Heck, I barely hold any \(less than 1&amp;#37; of my portofolio\). but please, continue your discovery of what a strawman argument means. **The fact remains we were talking about brave and how it blocks ads.** Also, stop cherry picking on my arguments you actually \(think\) you have a counter to.

"Non-mining nodes do not add blocks to the block chain and thus cannot vote in the system's consensus mechanism. As such, these nodes provide utility almost entirely for the user running them, *NOT* for the network as a whole. In fact, poorly resourced or badly configured non-mining nodes represent a net drain on the overall network. So at best, a non-mining node contributes almost nothing to the network, and what it does contribute is quite marginal, but most non-mining nodes are operated quite far from a best-case situation (in fact, a likely strong majority of them run without opening a listening port) so *on average* non-mining nodes are a net negative on the network as a whole.  

That said, we have years of evidence now from the BTC block chain that even with quite large numbers of non-mining nodes operating on the network, the system still works just fine (i.e. the cumulative net drain of large numbers of less-than-optimal non-mining nodes doesn't significantly handicap the overall network).  

TL;DR: Non-mining full nodes are not a big deal to the overall network either way, but they absolutely do not vote in system consensus.",1526400992
"I ran a pseudo experiment on this for two months (feb to April, so arguably bearish) where every morning I would ‚Äúsell‚Äù the entirety of my holdings and rebuy either, A) the highest % changer for the day or B) the most negative % changer for the day.  

Within those two months, experiment A consistently outperformed experiment B, although during this timeframe buying and holding BTC had the same if not better performance than experiment A.  

Takeaway: probably nothing since this strategy was clearly just a reflection of what strategy would‚Äôve worked best *for that time period*. However, it does show that momentum is still a thing for crypto despite the faster cycles - what goes up can tend to still go up, and what goes down can still tend to go down, at least in the short term.  

In other words, timing a dip (buying at the bottom) can be just as hard as timing a top (selling at the top), but if you buy when you see a trend occurring, it‚Äôs more likely you are buying as the trend continues (you didn‚Äôt time the top) versus buying at the turnaround of the downward trend (you didn‚Äôt time the bottom).

You joke about the $1 I made, but you're practically saying you'll accept money.  You can't expect to go through that sort of trauma and expect to be just fine.



Your comment. I highlighted the important parts for you: ""
I don‚Äôt seem to be coming back. I basically have the same story as OP except that I went from investing everything I had (as a college student) to buy 60 BTC in 2013 and holding strong for a solid 4 years. **Then having a mental health crisis during 2016 and giving 20 BTC away to strangers online who took advantage of me, never to be seen again**. Then in December, days before the top, I learned what margin trading actually was. Mad a tiny bit. Lost a good amount while falling asleep during a drop and then chasing the whole thing (40 BTC) down to 0.02 BTC.

I‚Äôm beyond devastated. **I‚Äôm confident that I‚Äôm going to end my life over this and I‚Äôve already begun separating myself from the world and getting my affairs in order**. I feel weird revealing and admitting this on reddit, but this post hits home, as does the one of the main sub about the guy‚Äôs brother who killed himself over the same situation.

**I admire those who can weather setbacks of this kind but I‚Äôm not one of them**. I knew from the minute I read the white paper that Bitcoin was a game changing idea. I poured my savings into it, confident that my stack would be worth a million (20K) within 5 years (I called this almost perfectly). It‚Äôs not even like I want to live an extravagant lifestyle, I just wanted to feel financially safe for once in my life and wanted to share the wealth with those close to me and help build positive businesses and a better world. The pump and dumpers and Lamborghini memes are so obnoxious, as if the world needs any more mindless hedonistic consumerism. **I grew up pretty poor and bounced from foster home to foster home and from school to school**. I barely made it through college and have no marketable skills.** I lost my dead end sales job a few months back and can‚Äôt bring myself to go back to barely getting buy. I held strong throughout the years, even though I could‚Äôve certainly used the money at times. I always brought my own lunch to work and always took the subway when I could instead of paying for Uber. I invested a few thousand dollars back in 2013 and never saw a penny of it. OP is much more honorable than me because I certainly don‚Äôt have the self respect to turn down donations but I‚Äôm also pretty certain that people aren‚Äôt donating to the small army of people who are in the same situation and I obviously don‚Äôt deserve it anyway. When I run into friends, they always ask about how well I must be doing because they know I‚Äôve been a Bitcoin proponent for a long time. Smiling and looking at them in the eye while talking positively about Bitcoin is incredibly taxing and I immediately want to throw up in the nearest trash can afterwards.

I know somewhere else in the universe, there‚Äôs a ‚Äòme‚Äô who decided against margin trading or stopped after a few losses or didn‚Äôt start playing bull at the beginning of a bear market. Not me though, I‚Äôm a fool and I squandered the only thing going for me in life. I hope others heed the warnings, but I know most won‚Äôt. Either way, **I don‚Äôt have the type of mind to let something like this go** and I can‚Äôt stand to watch Bitcoin moon again and be left behind. It‚Äôs sad that money can have such power over people. I know many have had their lives dramatically changed for the better but I suppose there are two sides to the coin.

**I don‚Äôt even know why I still obsess over Bitcoin and this sub**. I literally can‚Äôt think of anything else most of the time. I guess I keep hoping that it will drop to some very low amount and that I‚Äôll be able to buy back in but that doesn‚Äôt make sense because **I don‚Äôt have $10 to my name** to put back in. **I‚Äôm going to lose my unemployment benefits and housing in a few months** and really have nowhere to turn once that happens.

I know most people would pull themselves up by their bootstraps and carry on but I know that I could never escape my mind. Sorry to rant negatively on your kind and reasoned comment. I wish OP the best and he seems to have a much better attitude towards the ordeal than I do, even with the stakes being that much higher.

edit: I mostly regret posting this. I sort of figured it would get buried, didn‚Äôt realize that this thread was still pretty active and that I posted on the top comment. Thanks for the comments, PMs and kind words. I‚Äôm not in immediate danger of anything and wasn‚Äôt trying to start a pity party for myself. Nonetheless, thank you all for your concern.

The is‚Äìought problem, as articulated by Scottish philosopher and historian David Hume (1711‚Äì76), states that many writers make claims about what ought to be, based on statements about what is. Hume found that there seems to be a significant difference between positive statements (about what is) and prescriptive or normative statements (about what ought to be), and that it is not obvious how one can coherently move from descriptive statements to prescriptive ones. The is‚Äìought problem is also known as Hume's law, or Hume's guillotine.

A similar view is defended by G. E. Moore's open-question argument, intended to refute any identification of moral properties with natural properties.

In next 2 to 3 years, while crypto is still relatively new, imagine the market cap split and distributed between thousands of cryptos and crypto-related projects.

This will seriously dilute the gains and multipliers that many of us are thinking about (let's be real here). There is a strong school of thought that the massive gains and pumps that we already had were significant and will only happen lesser and lesser going forward.

The dollar does change in value, and goods change in cost, but at a much slower rate than bitcoin, a rate that you don't really notice from day to day unless there is a time of crisis, like when the euro crashed to nearly dollar parity recently.

"&gt; It is inflation-proof.
&gt; 
&gt; Inflation-proof doesn't meant an asset itself doesn't undergo inflation (it can, e.g. gold mining), it just means that all else being equal, its value when denominated in a currency will rise accordingly in response to that currency's inflation.

Why is that a good thing? It would be better to be able to control the inflation rate, than be at its mercy.

&gt;Completely incorrect. The only inflation it undergoes is known far in advance, by mining, and that will cease at a certain point. To be clear, when Bitcoin inflates, it means that the number of Bitcoins in existence increases, decreasing the purchasing power of each one. What they are randomly valued at at that time due is not taken into consideration when talking of inflation.

The buying power of Bitcoin can grossly fluctuate, just not as a result of monetary policy, which is in fact a method of controlling its value. 

Your little semantic nitpicks are meaningless. ",1526399669

&gt; #Bitcoin
&gt; 
&gt; Bitcoin is a digital currency that only exists online. It exists since January 1 2009 and can be used to pay in webshops or for other online services.
&gt; 
&gt; Unlike regular money, Bitcoins aren't put into circulation by a central bank. Instead of that, all Bitcoins are created by making computers solve mathematical problems. It goes like this: Anyone can run special software on their computer that helps solve the problem. The owner of the computer that solves the problem receives 25 (newly created) Bitcoins as a reward. In 2014 approximately every 10 minutes one of these problems was solved, creating 25 more bitcoins every 10 minutes.
&gt; 
&gt; On January 1st 2014 about 12.2 million bitcoins had been created.  
&gt; (3 points) **7.** Calculate using these numbers when the number of Bitcoins in circulation rises above 18 million if the rate at which Bitcoins are created does not change.
&gt; 
&gt; In reality, the rate at which Bitcoins are created does change. It goes down slowly. During the first four years, January 1st 2009 until January 1st 2013, the reward was 50 bitcoins per solution. The reward for finding a solution is halved every four years: From January 1st 2013 until January 1st 2017 the reward is 25 Bitcoins, the four years after that 12.5, etcetera.  
&gt; (4 points) **8.** ",1526399633

Bitcoins
The bitcoin is a digital currency that only exists online. He
exists since January 1, 2009 and can be used to pay in
online stores or for other online services.
Bitcoins are not, as normal money, by a central bank
circulation. Instead, all bitcoins that are in circulation are
created by letting computers work on solutions from
selected mathematical problems. That works like this:
Anyone can run special software on his or her computer
contributes to solving such a mathematical problem. The owner
of the computer that finds the solution to a problem
25 (newly created) bitcoins as a reward. Because in 2014 every
10 minutes such a problem was solved, were there in this way
every 25 minutes 25 bitcoins are put into circulation.
On 1 January 2014 there were (approximately) 12.2 million bitcoins in circulation.
3p 7 Calculate the number of bitcoins in circulation starting from this year
above 18 million as the rate at which bitcoins are in circulation
not be changed.
In reality, the speed with which bitcoins get in circulation
not equal to 25 bitcoins per 10 minutes. This speed is taking
namely. During the first four years, from 1 January 2009 to
January 1, 2013, the reward per solution was 50 bitcoins. The
reward for finding a solution is every four years
halved: from 1 January 2013 to 1 January 2017, the remuneration is per
solution 25 bitcoins, for the next four years 12.5 bitcoins per solution
and so on.
4p 8 From which year calculate the reward for each solution less than one bitcoin
will be.
The total number of bitcoins that can be put into circulation is limited.
This is a consequence of (among other things) the fact that the remuneration per
solution is always halved. The total number of bitcoins that are in
circulation, can be approximated with the formula:
0.25 21 21 0.5 t C ÔÉó ÔÄΩÔÄ≠ÔÉó
Here C is the total number of bitcoins in millions and t the time in years with
t ÔÄΩ 0 on 1 January 2009.
3p 9 Use the reasoning of the formula to determine the
limit value of the total number of bitcoins in circulation In order to regulate the total number of bitcoins in circulation,
only the number of bitcoins per solution is made smaller, but also
the difficulty of mathematical problems is increasing
made. There are more and more people who bring their computers
let it count.
The difficulty of the problems increases exponentially according to the
formula 0.533 3.65 e .t D ÔÉó ÔÄΩ ÔÉó
Here D is a measure of the degree of difficulty and the time in months
with t ÔÄΩ 0 on 1 January 2013. The larger is D, how
harder to solve the problem.
4p 10 Compose the formula of the derivative of D and explain how to handle this
formula can see that the graph of D is increasing.
The formula can be rewritten in such a way that you can use a difficulty level
fill in and calculate the time in months needed to do so
level of difficulty.
4p 11 Rewrite the formula 0.533 3.65 e t D ÔÉó ÔÄΩ ÔÉó so that t is expressed in D",1526399460
"Yep 5 months solid. To be honest I think the main pros are that I can spend my crypto but also keep the money invested at the same time. Some cards like Bitpay make you cash out before loading your card which is pointless. I might as well just cash the money out to my bank account. With the Shift card, it cashes out at the moment of purchase which is great.

I also can transfer a large amount of money quickly into the card if I need to spend it on a large purchase. I can do this without having to transfer money from my savings into my debit card. I have never had an issue purchasing anything with it either",1526399458

"Your submission has been flagged for removal because it pertains to an incompatible derivative of Bitcoin commonly referred to as Bcash (BCH/BCC), or ‚ÄòBitcoin Cash‚Äô. Prior to August 1st 2017, Bcash did not exist *(see:* [*‚ÄúBitcoin Cash Veers Off at Block Height 478558‚Äù*](https://archive.is/fCbpa)*)*. A small segment of miners decided to create an incompatible set of consensus rules based on Bitcoin‚Äôs existing network, and at block heigh 478559, Bcash was born. This method of copying an existing blockchain with no consensus among the existing network is commonly referred to as an airdrop. The Bcash token has become problematic primarily due to deceptive marketing practices portraying Bcash as if it were Bitcoin. But since Bcash is an merely impostor of Bitcoin, it really doesn‚Äôt belong in the Bitcoin subreddit. Therefore the /r/Bitcoin mod team (and readers) kindly ask you to post in a Bcash-oriented subreddit instead. Despite its misleading name, the /r/btc subreddit prides itself on welcoming all Bcash-related material (while ironically being anti-Bitcoin at the same time). Other subreddits which welcome Bcash-related material include /r/bcash and /r/bitcoincash. If you require assistance in claiming the Bcash airdrop or others, we recommend posting this to the /r/BitcoinAirdrops subreddit for more info. Thank you.

"As I‚Äôve written before:

The average user has absolutely ZERO need to run a so-called ""full node.""   An SPV client can allow you to verify that the transactions that you care about have been included in a block with valid PoW and grow increasingly confident that this block has been accepted by the network as a whole as you watch it get buried ever deeper under more blocks with valid PoW while remaining the longest chain. SPV doesn't imply *less* security / confidence in the transactions you care about; it simply takes *a bit more time* to achieve a given level of confidence in a particular transaction of interest. (And that difference is extremely tiny, if not essentially theoretical, given how incredibly unlikely it is that you'll encounter an invalid block with valid PoW.)

The only assumption you make when you rely on SPV security is that the mining majority won't accept ""invalid"" blocks.  But Bitcoin's security model has *always* been explicitly premised on the assumption that the mining majority would be incentivized to be ""honest"" and protect the integrity of the network. Moreover, a malicious hash rate majority doesn't *need* to produce ""invalid"" blocks to defraud users or otherwise completely undermine the network's integrity.

This is the point where some people object: ""but if *no one* is running a fully-validating node, what will prevent the mining majority from cheating?"" The answer is that any systemic breach of Bitcoin's money properties by a misbehaving hash power majority is going to be communicated by *the market* when the price craters. *That's* the incentive system that we rely on to keep the hash power majority honest. And obviously not every single market participant needs to have first-hand evidence of a breach for the market to do its job. The notion that it will become so outrageously expensive to run a ""full node"" that the market would somehow lose the ability to disincentivize cheating is ludicrous. (And again, a malicious mining majority doesn't *need* to produce ""invalid"" blocks to cheat.) The incentive system *certainly* won't break down just because every Johnny Two-Bits can't afford to verify every form of breach for himself on his laptop. And of course, if running a ""full node"" *were* to become ""outrageously expensive,"" that implies that Bitcoin has become massively more popular and valuable which in turn implies that there will be many more people with an incentive to police the network's integrity.  Moreover, the individuals and entities with the greatest incentive to police the network and the greatest ability to punish a misbehaving mining majority are the same ones for whom the cost of operating a ""full node"" will always be trivial.",1526398627

Undoubtedly there's a lot of innovation happening in this space now, but I don't think we should underestimate the elegance of the idea presented in the Bitcoin white paper, which was abandoned before it could be implemented at scale.",1526398336
"It just makes competing forks easier with it's current implementation, that's all.  I think that's probably why it initially had around two weeks before each adjustment.  I would hate to have 10 forks of BCH in the future because of it.

It's really not a debate that's needed today anyway, but I can imagine some time in the future it will come up once BTC has actually died of chain death which may not happen anyway because of our current DAA...  My guess is it will just slowly whither away into irrelevance.",1526398335
"I wouldn't say they're shilling. The utility bonuses XRP brings are quite substantial if you consider at the moment, people are paying fairly high transfer fee's alongside slow transaction times, even when you use ETH instead of BTC. 

XRP transfers 2-3 seconds with transfers fee under $0.01 cent. 

I'm not shilling btw, just stating facts :)",1526398313
"You may be confusing trading volume with those that are getting their first (or adding more) bitcoin.

Firms like [BitMex](https://www.bitmex.com/) that have HUGE volume do ZERO conversion to fiat. Thus one already has to have bitcoin before they can use BitMex.",1526398270
"If you made the claim that you've been in crypto since 2014, I find it incredulous that you are unaware of the value proposition of crypto. The design of blockchain is the way it is, because the ultimate value proposition is censorship-resistance/immutability. Bitcoin is censorship-resistant/immutable because it is decentralised. It is addressing a specific issue on monetary policy, and is the backbone of trustless platforms. Ethereum is fundamentally different in many ways, so much that it is not a competitor to Bitcoin.

Ethereum can move fast because it trades off decentralisation (the main value proposition).",1526398215
"Listen, I agree with everything you‚Äôre saying. It‚Äôs just been my experience that I told my Dad to use Coinbase, and he did, and somehow his account was locked, and he called in, and someone said it will be taken care of right away, but it took about 3 more weeks before he could do anything. My wife and I had a two step verification process that  took almost 6 months to resolve. So right there, in my family alone, there‚Äôs been 2 incidents that took way to long to resolve. Hardly anybody I know is into crypto at all. It‚Äôs so new, not many people are involved. But, the time is coming when they will all want to get into crypto too, and I can tell you, it‚Äôll be hard for my family to suggest Coinbase, especially if there will be more options to get in in the US. I guess I‚Äôm arguing the point that the little guy is just as important as the big guys. Good customer service is expected by all if you want your business to be successful. Mark my words, if Coinbase gives mediocre customer service to these big financial institutions, they‚Äôll get dumped quicker than the weekly trash. 

I want Coinbase to be successful!!! But if you can‚Äôt do it with the small guys, I don‚Äôt know how in the world you can do it with the big guys. ",1526398137
"All the (non-mining) ‚Äúfull nodes‚Äù in the world are powerless against a malicious mining majority. Bitcoin‚Äôs entire security model is predicated on the notion that a majority of the hash power will be ‚Äúhonest,‚Äù i.e., incentivized to protect the integrity of the network. Borrowing from recent comment of /u/ForkiusMaximus:

&gt;Bitcoin is predicated on miners following the rules, as it is in their best interest to do so. If this weren't the case, a rogue miner's best (here meaning most damaging) move is to collude to 51% attack the network. Crucially note that non-mining clients are defenseless against this attack. Meanwhile, SPV wallets work flawlessly as long as that basic premise holds. The only edge case where a ""full nodes"" (in quotes because nodes mine, see whitepaper and Bitcoin 1.0 readme.txt) can help is one where miners go insane but in a dumb way where they do a feeble invalid block attack instead of the much more effective 51% attack using perfectly valid blocks (thus ""full validating node"" is no help). And even then it is only a matter of waiting for additional confirmations thanks to the convergence dynamics of the Keynesian beauty contest in blocks that every miner participates in.",1526398121

Your point? 

Miners secure the network.  What they do can be undone given an insane amount of resources.  The Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash blockchains are incredibly secure, owing to the miner's efforts.

Miners secure the blockchain.

"Hi there!

What is your view on the hype cycle in regards to ""Blockchain""? I mean this in terms of the general situation: Do you think we're still drowning in meaningless buzzwords or is the fog clearing? Do you feel you are adding to this hype and feel guilty? :-)

I am not saying you are or you should; I am an old-time Bitcoiner who's in it for the profit (of course) and the better money aspects. I simply think there's lots of hype in this space and I got a little bit tired of the 'Blockchain!Blockchain!', 'da next big thing' kind of cries. So don't take it the wrong way, but I think exploring this aspect especially by - perceived by me - big old tech giants might move the discussion and state of hype forward to a saner situation. We're heading towards ""10 years of Blockchain"" and that's a level of maturity I'd call ""old and boring"" - yet for some reason, neither the public's nor the tech world's opinion on ""blockchain"" seems to have reached sanity yet (IMO).

As you seem to be interested in tokens: 

What are, in your opinion, the important reasons why one wants to store tokens on a public ledger?

How do you think the importance of tokens ranks vs. the importance of censorship-resistant money?

Do you think simple token systems suffice ([like my own, very simple SITO proof of concept](https://github.com/awemany/sito)) or do you think they should work as incentivized meta coins?

Do you see yourself and/or IBM as a ""customer of BCH""?

What do you think about POW systems vs. other approaches?

Last but not least, what's your view on the blocksize debate? I, again must admit my ignorance here: But it does seem peculiar that you are doing an AMA explicitly here on /r/btc.

Right now the perceived big 3 are:

BTC, ETH and LTC.  Obviously from a Market cap perspective those aren't the Top 3 but again, that's why I used the word perceived.

Some highlights from the Top 25 coins \(not all\)

BTC \- Still a solid buy because the store of value of Bitcoin has become utilitarian; It is akin to staking land in the wild, wild west run of which there is resource scarcity with the final Bitcoin being mined in the back of peoples minds.

ETH \- Arguably Blockchain 2.0 with Smart Contracts but still burdened with how people are projecting their individual vision for the tech.  Owning this still not a bad buy.

Ripple \- Nope

Bcash \- Garbage

EOS \- Garbage

Litecoin \- Legacy Coin that has been out performed by the likes of Nano, FLASH and others.  Not worth keeping since store of value is near 0.  Useful for transferring large amounts of money between exchanges but that's about it.

Cardano \- Perhaps ETH 2.0 \(or Blockchain 3.0\) but still a gamble

Stellar \- Partnered with IBM, definitely a good purchase.

IOTA \- Could be huge, good partnerships but how it plays out short term/long term, could be poked full of security concerns.

TRON \- garbage

NEO \- Good buy\-\- ECO system starting to fill out, moving towards decentralized.  NEP\-5 tokens \(based on NEO\) are a good buy as well.

DASH \- Room to grow, but not sure long play pans out

Monero \- Good privacy coin\-\- needs to provide clear roadmap for how privacy within all Blockchain space / spend, save and store works.

VeChain \- Great partners, needed within the major industries.

ICON \- I would say either AION or ICON are great long term holds since they're working on inter\-Blockchain protocol systems that create universal dApps and better overall Blockchains ecosystems.

OMG \- Interesting

Lisk \- Hot garbage

Other coins worth looking at:

ONT, Nano, WAN, SC, AION, ARK, POLY, HOLO, RVN, TRAC, GVT, AMB

Biggest take away is if you're going to hold these for 1,3,5 years or more, get a hardware wallet or laptop to keep offline and store away from the internet.

If you ignore over a decade of deflation punctuated with short term inflationary spikes then yes consumer prices didn't move at all.

&gt;Wages in a 10% band over 25 years averaging -0.4% per year this equates to a CPI of +0.4% per year, far better than 2% or 5% or 10% or 10,000%.

From 1997 to 2013 wages decreased far faster than consumer prices did. If you look at other nations like Australia or China during the same time wages far outpaced inflation. I'm not sure how you think that is ""better than 10,000%"".

&gt;It is _a change_ and it should be acknowledged. It is significant that the change occurred and why it occurred. The change to EDA _was not_ because it was better.

Again for the second time, I agree.

You didn‚Äôt reply to my question: is it a significant change? Does it change the nature of BCH?

And what are the significant difference between BTC and BCH?

&gt;&amp;gt;I don‚Äôt understand the necessity of comparing work between two separate chain

&gt;It is important that a bitcoin blockchain be built by the greatest pool of work capacity. I know this is not a commonly held opinion among BCH supporters, or even many BTC supporters. Regardless, it is useful to meaningfully compare hash rate across chains which share common work capacity in order to confirm which is built by a majority.

If it is important for you, just take cumulative PoW.

The chart is available on fork.lol



&gt;&amp;gt;Per-block is irrelevant

&gt;Per-block is relevant. It indicates how many confirmations attacker can hope to roll back.

Not for a 51% attack.

The only important metric is how much hash rate necessary to reach 51%

Whatever block arrive quickly or slowly doesn‚Äôt change anything.

&gt;&amp;gt;So I agree BCH will be cheaper to attack only if it is supported by less hash rate. 

&gt;The comparison is not meant directly between BTC and BCH, rather between the relative delta of their initial and post-DAA states. That is, BCH becomes easier to attack than its initial state faster than BTC becomes easier to attack.

As said above: no.

&gt;&amp;gt;Not hostile, lost

&gt;80% is a cataclysmic loss. The _mere possibility_ that such a significant work source is available to go rogue should crash the price.

I agree.

Only BCH would have a chance to recover for such lost by getting functional again in few days (extra capacity helps).",1526394521

Imagine coinbase is takes up 50% market share and offloads all transactions from the mainnet. What if coinbase goes down for a week?

"**Efficient-market hypothesis**

The efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) is a theory in financial economics that states that asset prices fully reflect all available information. A direct implication is that it is impossible to ""beat the market"" consistently on a risk-adjusted basis since market prices should only react to new information.

The efficient market hypothesis (EMH) was developed by Eugene Fama who argued that stocks always trade at their fair value, making it impossible for investors to either purchase undervalued stocks or sell stocks for inflated prices. As such, it should be impossible to outperform the overall market through expert stock selection or market timing, and that the only way an investor can possibly obtain higher returns is by chance or by purchasing riskier investments.

These are the guys the IRS are going go after, not the average Joe who didn't pay his $500 in taxes. I've talked to a few CPA's and they've said IRS is extremely behind and understaffed. 

- In 2016 the IRS did fewer audits than ever before, despite an increase in returns. 

- Nearly three-quarters of all audits are handled by mail

- Each year, tens of thousands of taxpayers walk out of an audit with a check from the government. In 2016, for example, about 31,000 audits (1 in 4,400) resulted in refunds totaling $931 million

- During the 2015 fiscal year, the latest for which complete data is available, the IRS audited about 0.8%

- Of that 0.8%, 62.55% of those were with incomes higher than 1 Million.

- Taxpayers with a $60,000 adjusted gross income (AGI), for example, have just a 0.47% chance of being audited.

My point is, the chances of being audited are extremely low and the IRS is really behind. Add Crypto to the mix and I guarantee you that the IRS is looking for people like Ian Balina who have a lot of cash and show red flags. They are not going after the average Joe who is making $100,000 (including crypto gains) especially if they are only paying Crypto &amp;gt; Fiat and not every transaction. They will see average Joe paid his taxes, showed no red flags and will focus on bigger fish. They are not going to audit someone who paid taxes but thinks they didn't pay crypto to crypto taxes.

"**Bitcoin Price Eyes Breakout As Trading Range Tightens**

https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-eyes-breakout-as-trading-range-tightens/

Bitcoin (BTC) is stuck in a narrow $550 range between the key long-term moving averages today, but may be prepping for a breakout, the technical charts suggest.

With the bull/bear bias now unclear, the big problem now is trying to work out in which direction the price will go.

As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $8,760 on Bitfinex, and is trading between the 50-day moving average (MA) at $8,287 and the 100-day moving average at $8,837.

The sell-off from the May 5 high of $9,990 came to halt around the 50-day MA on Saturday. Further, the 50-day MA also acted as strong support on Monday. Meanwhile, on both occasions, the rebound from the 50-day MA ran out of steam around the 100-day MA hurdle.

The rangebound action seen in the last three days has established the 50-day MA as a major support and the 100-day MA as a formidable resistance and the breakout of this zone will likely set the tone for the next big move in BTC.

View

Another rejection at the descending trendline seen in the 4-hour chart will likely yield a drop to 50-day MA located at $8,287.

That said, only a daily close (as per UTC) below the 50-day MA would signal a revival of the sell-off from the recent high of $9,990 and would allow a deeper drop to $7,787 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the April 1 low to the May 5 high) or even as low as $7,698 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the July 2015 low to the December 2017 high).

On the other hand, a convincing move above $8,910 (expanding channel hurdle) would expose resistance lined up at $9,390.",1526393829

"This is what OP wrote before, and is why the smart choose Bitcoin:

I think the Foundation should just go ahead and accept that they are the authority in all things related to Ethereum protocol development at this stage. And I believe that we should all accept it, too. I didn't invest into Ethereum because I felt that it would be 100% community-driven at this stage. If it was, I would view that as a profound implementation risk (like I view on-chain governance from EOS on day one).

The Foundation could be is effectively a benevolent leader with close to absolute power, working to make informed decisions- both through analysis and community input. And Vitalik is the most important voice in the Foundation. For what it's worth, I don't love when they ""push"" decisions to the community. The process for doing this isn't clear, and relies mostly upon social media sentiment which is not representative and could be heavily manipulated.

I don't always agree with the Foundation's decisions, but they are the only party whose motivations I trust to be in the long term interests of the network more often than not. And they can make those decisions with minimal accusation of being ""self interested,"" which in itself is very powerful.

After Ethereum has implemented Plasma, Proof of Stake, and Sharding, to me, that is when we need to think critically about a more inclusive and sustainable model governance. And at that point, I would prefer a model that is more republic-oriented than direct democracy-oriented, because as the world shows us, uninformed but empowered participants can be dangerous to the long term viability and integrity of an institution. But this also raises many risks. These are very difficult issues to solve. We shouldn't try to do it at lightning speed.

"**Bitcoin**

Bitcoin (‚Çø) is a cryptocurrency and worldwide payment system. It is the first decentralized digital currency, as the system works without a central bank or single administrator. The network is peer-to-peer and transactions take place between users directly, without an intermediary. These transactions are verified by network nodes through the use of cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain.

***

**Bitcoin Core**

Bitcoin Core is an implementation of bitcoin. Initially, the software was published by Satoshi Nakamoto under the name ""Bitcoin"", and later renamed to ""Bitcoin Core"" to distinguish it from the network. For this reason, it is also known as the Satoshi client. As of 2018, Bitcoin Core repositories are maintained by a team of maintainers, with Wladimir J. van der Laan leading the release process.

***

**Bitcoin Cash**

Bitcoin Cash is a cryptocurrency. In mid-2017 the developers, not content with the Segregated Witness feature, implemented a change to the bitcoin code. The change, called a hard fork, took effect on August 1, 2017. As a result, the bitcoin ledger called the blockchain and the cryptocurrency split in two.

Pay to surf (PTS) is a business model that became popular in the late 1990s until the dot-com crash. Essentially, a company uses income from advertising placed on members' screens to pay them for time spent surfing.

BCH is getting OP Codes to enable developers to build on top of the BCH protocol to bring the world new distributed and uncensored social platforms like memo.cash and blockpress.com which are exploding with new features in just days!

Also if this were ever attempted packets could be encrypted easily enough so again it's not practical to even try this approach.

They could disconnect the country from the internet... sadly there are bitcoin satellites spinning over our heads, again this banning the internet wouldn't prevent people from doing it either.

They could tell people it's illegal to use... but that just prevents the legitimate benefits of it being utilised in that country while the rest of the world gains from the efficiencies it offers.

The could demonize it saying it's only for nefarious things to scare people from using it.  This seems to be the main approach taken but looks like that's failed too now people see it is actually useful.


So basically can they ban it?  Not really when it matters, they could ban it in countries that don't have anything to lose from people using it but what's the point.

"&gt;Actually the people that are born after 2140 (when all bitcoin has been mined) will be at an advantage because the money supply is not increasing as it is today

Supply rate has already halved twice, once in 2012 and once in 2016.

By the logic that the smaller the bitcoin supply rate, the greater the advantage, people who got into bitcoin in 2016 should have had a bigger advantage than people who got in at 2012 or 2009.

Unless you say, well they won't have the advantage the early adopters had, but they have a different advantage. Well which advantage is greater, being an early adopter or a later adopter? It's impossible for them both to have the greater advantage. Either the opportunity is equal or its greater/lesser.

Why do people who say that Bitcoin is going to hit $1m-100m a coin and make them rich, and is also going to ""stabilize in price once it hits mass adoption"" say that people who will only be able to get bitcoin decades from now will actually have a greater advantage than the people who had a chance to become multi millionaires from sitting on $500 worth of coins? Will people in 2140 be able to sell 2 pizzas and then let deflation turn them into multi-millionaires in 8 years? 

How exactly is that more egalitarian than a supply protocol that just ensured a consistent value of bitcoin (or even just a consistent increase in value) so that you had no greater or lesser advantage regardless of when you were born and when you started to use bitcoin? Rather than a system designed to have exponential decreases in supply to cause exponential increases in price?",1526391211

"That's fair enough, I don't have to agree with all your opinions either, that's the point in finding consensus!

Core can't ""go it's own way"", it's an open development process, who are _you_ to tell someone that their work is bad, and they can't commit to a repository when _you_ have never committed anything, and all the other devs that _do_ commit happen to think it's worth reviewing, review it, and agree (or disagree).  The Bitcoin repo _does_ have a review process, and it's not controlled by Blockstream despite what many round here say (none of their employees even have commit access). 

Bad ideas are generally rejected, and I think I would trust the open source community to make the right decision, over the demands of someone with financial interests.

Hindsight is a wonderful thing, we can look back and see where we've come from, but we can't look forward to 2021 (or further) and imagine with any certainty of what the landscape of crypto will be.  I was using bitcoin in 2015, and I still use it to this day (in fact I received some last Friday, and bought some today!), to me, it's not significantly different, I just use a different wallet than I did 3 years ago.

With the benfit of that hindsight though, how bad has SegWit really been?  Have any funds been lost (apart from Bitcoin Cash sending to SegWit addresses)?  Has it reduced capacity? Has it done any of the terrible things that people on this very sub complained about? 

Nope? Nope!

So why was it blocked?  Why was there a campaign headed by one of the moderators of this sub (that I can't link to as my post is likely to be edited/removed)?  Why was so much effort put into blocking it's activation, now it's activated, hasn't made a difference (or may have reduced fees for some).

Personally, I don't see ""core"" having ""hijacked"" the ""brand"" (to me it's Bitcoin, not a brand), as outside influencers attempting to push their will onto bitcoin, and rather than actually commit code, and work with the existing processes, bang the loudest drum they can find and start campaign's calling out other people as a distraction technique. 

[This picture](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dc_3rufW4AE3COJ.jpg) is very telling.

And no, I still disagree with brigading, and censorship, which is why I am here (as I said in my above post).  Although I am fully aware that this sub is owned by Roger Ver, and the moderators are his paid staff, so it is by no means unbiased.  I think we should all be allowed to have opinions, but not all opinions should have equal weight (uninformed people's opinions are nice, but of little to no relevance when it comes to technical matters), and I really don't appreciate people following me round [mudslinging](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8jdamn/trying_to_see_both_sides_of_the_scaling_debate/dyzgpnz/), this is the kind of thing that puts people off, if you can't disagree with someone without being called a troll, what sort of experience is that?

Also, you say facebook, twitter, and google are against cryptocurrency. That again isn't even true and I don't know how you jump to some huge leaps. Not advertising on their platform because most ICOs are scams isn't giving a thumbs down to crypto if anything it forces those truly interested in crypto to do real research instead of seeing an ad that guarantees a 1000x.

Lastly, even though I feel like I am beating a dead horse answering to the Warren Buffet one. Warren Buffet is an amazing traditional investor however he doesn't invest in tech. He missed out investing the company that owns google and amazon.

It is not about being one sided. One sided is telling me that blocksizes need to stay small for reasons and so people should not use the blockchain that we promised them.  LN is not why I got in to Crypto.  It is not the model that I want to bring to the world.  It is, to me, a complex way of handling microtransactions, which might be good for some games.

With fiat the central bank creates the money by loaning it into existence. They don't have to do any work.

I don't think I'm alone in this, so I wish BCH folks would push these types of arguments more, and ask Ver to turn it down slightly/a lot. I acknowledge he took a similarly aggressive (but not so negative) approach in early BTC days. But, pairing his current methods, the small # of BCH nodes, and the large miners with the economies of scale they have now (vs. not so much in early BTC days, although perhaps relatively to early-days network size/hash power, they may have had EOS as well), gives BCH a bit of an aura of centralization run by a small set of very powerful miners and very distasteful leader.

When did I tell you to hold anything?  I'm simply observing the state of things.  Lots of people think they hold gold, when in reality they hold bits of paper, and someone else entirely holds the gold, in very large quantity. The paper may become worthless. The gold will not.

"&gt;Ok but is it a significant change?

It is _a change_ and it should be acknowledged. It is significant that the change occurred and why it occurred. The change to EDA _was not_ because it was better.

&gt;I don‚Äôt understand the necessity of comparing work between two separate chain

It is important that a bitcoin blockchain be built by the greatest pool of work capacity. I know this is not a commonly held opinion among BCH supporters, or even many BTC supporters. Regardless, it is useful to meaningfully compare hash rate across chains which share common work capacity in order to confirm which is built by a majority.

&gt;Per-block is irrelevant

Per-block is relevant. It indicates how many confirmations attacker can hope to roll back.

&gt;So I agree BCH will be cheaper to attack only if it is supported by less hash rate. 

The comparison is not meant directly between BTC and BCH, rather between the relative delta of their initial and post-DAA states. That is, BCH becomes easier to attack than its initial state faster than BTC becomes easier to attack.

&gt;Not hostile, lost

80% is a cataclysmic loss. The _mere possibility_ that such a significant work source is available to go rogue should crash the price.",1526387699
This is good news. This should accelerate crypto adoptions with institutions.,1526387650
"I disagree.  You've got it only part right.  I get the whole ""BCH is to be used"", not just ""HODLed"" but the best way to play Bitcoin Cash is to think with duality of mind...

* When a person gets a paycheck, they should determine what can be spent using Bitcoin Cash - then immediately put that portion of their check into BCH, and then spend it.

"this is a bank transfer, from bank A to bank B, you can pretty much use any crypto to transfer between accounts of people, but if you want to be able to convert it back to USD and send it to your bank it will take some time. This method makes it possible to send from Bank A to bank B, crossborder, crosscurrency, in 2 minutes.  

&amp;nbsp;
 
XRP can be used for a lot of different things - one of the featurs is that you dont have to wait for confirmations after you send it to be able to use it on the other exchange, its ready immediately, so you can buy and move BTC the same way between exchanges, sell  BTC for XRP, transfer XRP to your other exchange, and buy BTC there, this saved you 40+ minutes of waiting for transaction times. Realise that institutions all have bank accounts - this offers a solution to all parties. You cant unbank the world instantly, this takes time. a bank is not just a party that holds your money and makes it transferable, they also hand out business loans, mortgages, provide interest and offer advise.. without banks, we wouldnt be today where we are now, so i have to disagree with you saying banks are only middleman for transactions. Dispite the negatives, they used their monopoly in the world to get away with it because they are needed for now. So i can say, i feel ya - but i stay realistic and know that businesses will always need money and loans, they need structures set up such as banks and the public needs mortages and public loans - no matter who you replace them with, they will still require the same from you as loan requester: you need to ensure you are able to make payments, at certain times, and if you are not able they should be able to take other actions towards you to ensure they will be paid.

&amp;nbsp;

Ripple also focusses their tech to payment service providers - such as Western Union, Moneygram, MercuryFX, Cuallix and others. Besides that, they are focusseing remittance programs integrated inside software of businesses with xVia. THey also focus on the unbanked - allowing a mobile app or text message to be used instead of a bank by mojaloop project (collaboration with Bill Gates Foundation) to address the large group of people who do not own bank accounts and do not have access to internet. So to answer your question there - they fit right in your profile at that stage.

&amp;nbsp;

not only Ripple is working on XRP, there are other companies and initiatives. Right now, COIL just launched, They will be focussing micropayments on the internet amongst other stuff (they launched yesterday)

&amp;nbsp;

the reason i quit mining btc was because i felt like i was just transfering my time and work to an electricity company who was just mainly focussed on getting rich without any intentions to donate any of those profits back into crypto. Same with Nvidea, AMD and other chipmanufacturing companies. They gladly take your money and share it with their shareholers or governments. Exchanges take out alot of revenue too, with only a small part of this flowing back into crypto again. Ripple uses the revenue they get as there is no need to mine the coin but they are taken out of circulation just like 'mined' coins and invests the large majority of this back into crypto - by investing in companies/startups that are using XRP.
 
&amp;nbsp;

so with other words, waht you want to happen is something that xrp is capable of. They are bridging to the banks as right now we have issues trying to get new money into crypto right? it takes a few days before our money is on exchanges and usable, this can be changed in the future to instant payments - in and out of crypto, empowering the entire crypto market where everyone benefits. Its just a first step, if you stick to reality you know you have to go through all these steps to be able to come to a truely unbanked society (we share that) but for now, switching from one system to another, we have to allow time to happen and be patient about it. XRP speeds up the process and makes sure the entire crypto community benefits from it - but thats jsut my opinion",1526387465

"&gt;Do you agree with me that this attribute of BTC makes it completely useless as a currency in the long run? If yes, do you see a way around this other than ensuring a steady inflation of BTC, i.e. dropping the hard supply cap?

I find the concept of a deflationary day-to-day currency pretty hard to envision. The world as we know it spins due to inflation and debt, and it would be painful if even palatable to alter that in the short-medium term. 

However, Bitcoin right now, even with its ridiculous volatility, is useful. I've been able to run a business that has sent Bitcoin worth well into the tens of thousands to several hundred people, with no regard to the recipients' locations, without having to support dozens of different banking routing systems, and without incurring any meaningful fees. This is an incredibly potent use case, and I don't see it going away in the foreseeable future, and it's made me quite eager to see the technology develop, but what I've been involved in doesn't quite map to 'currency', though it is a transfer of value. Indeed, I would guess the majority of people only kept a small amount of what they received in Bitcoin. I imagine this behaviour can be extrapolated for a long while, and so I think it's possible Bitcoin may continue to never be used as a proper currency, but while it's still valuable, it will still have use cases. I don't feel Bitcoin needs to take over as some 'global currency' to continue to exist; it will bore its own niche over time, especially with the advent of instant micropayments.

I don't see the hard supply cap ever getting the consensus to be lifted. At the point where there are serious demands for that, it will mean Bitcoin will have held value for a long, and to do so would be to compromise what it's shown to be good at.

I do see the possibility of other decentralized cryptocurrencies that do inflate, but use Bitcoin as a reserve, much in the way countries operate with gold and other metal reserves that partially back their currencies. I would also be more optimistic for these currencies' long term survival (on the scale of centuries/millennia) than state-backed currencies because I think there are several reasons to believe hyperinflation would be less likely to occur (if they remain decentralized).",1526387158

"It's a confusing example and I'm not sure how it's relevant.

Concepts of fairness are really not applicable to reality. If someone buys BCH or BTC post fork and the coin goes to zero, where is the fairness in that? Those people sour on the whole concept and sabotage the growth of crypto generally. 

Like it or not, there is a fixed pie of people who will decide to use crypto based on it's utility alone. The whole space could be a zero tomorrow based on regulatory changes. This is not what you want in a currency.

This rarely happens with things like gold - the properties are inherent.  I guess you could issue a debased gold issued as a rival (electrum maybe), but the market would decide this one (and through history has always decided correctly)..",1526386922

"I would actually think about it differently:

If some farm is aquiring too much hashing power (and therefore control for the network), more miners have to start in order to prevent that farm from gaining too much control.

I'm unsure but I wouldn't be surprised if someone who falls for a crypto scam because of an ad they saw on Facebook, would try and sue facebook for it. It's just a lot more efficient and safer for both Facebook, and the people who can see those ads.

"&gt; Without BCH existing, BTC would be trading much higher. 

I disagree thoroughly.  Your argument suffers from the fixed-sized pie fallacy.  Let me please provide a hypothetical counterexample that I hope will convince you.

One group wants white. Another, much smaller group, wants black.  Status quo is white. 

These groups are mutually exclusive. Everyone is in one or the other camp. Pro-white says that black is the worst thing in the world. Pro-black says that unless everyone immediately pivots to black, the sky will fall.  Attempts have been made to get the community to switch to black. Tremendous infighting ensues throughout the community. A third group proposes ""gray"" which nobody wants.  Impasse.

It's clear that the market will punish this situation.  Capital will avoid the uncertainty and infighting and doomsaying by all parties involved.

Now along comes the idea of a divorce. In the divorce, the assets will be fairly divided according to current market value. Everyone that wants white will get white, and can pursue whiteness without the encumbrance of the pro-blacks. Everyone that wants black can finally have black without the oppression of the pro-whites.  Everyone who's on the fence can have some of each. Nobody will have to endure gray, which nobody wanted.  Everyone is made better off.

This is an economic win-win for all parties and we would expect the market to reward this situation with lots of new capital coming in.

And this is exactly what has happened now. Not once but twice, because ETC/ETC also produced this same outcome.

Note: all forks are not alike. Here, I'm referring to coin splits that were founded on a true schism in the community where each group demanded mutually-opposed outcomes (it is impossible to give group A what it wants without doing exactly what group B doesn't want, and vice versa). Other forks may produce different results.",1526386092

This is the problem with new people to the space, everything seems more or less legit until it hits you personally and then you realize that everything you've read has been specifically picked and allowed through their filters. There is no organic discussion.

"**Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution**

The Sixteenth Amendment (Amendment XVI) to the United States Constitution allows the Congress to levy an income tax without apportioning it among the states or basing it on the United States Census. This amendment exempted income taxes from the constitutional requirements regarding direct taxes, after income taxes on rents, dividends, and interest were ruled to be direct taxes in the court case of Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co. (1895).

"Each transaction is taxed based on its USD value at the time of transaction.

In your example, purchasing $1000 of Bitcoin at Coinbase would open a position at that USD cost basis. Let's say that amount of BTC is worth $1100 at the point you trade it for Iota. That second transaction (BTC-Iota) created a $100 taxable event for the gain on your BTC and simultaneously created a new position in Iota with a cost basis of $1100. 

If you have no other transactions for the year you will have a $100 capital gain to pay taxes on.

Let's pretend for a moment that Iota moons later in the year and you decide to take profits back into BTC. If that $1100 Iota position is now worth $10,000 at the time you trade it back into BTC, you have now created a taxable event of $8900 ($10,000 - $1100) and also a new position in BTC with a cost basis of $10,000.

In this example you know have capital gains totaling $9000 ($8900 + $100) and a BTC position with a cost basis of $10,000 moving forward. 

The frustration for may folks here is that you now have a USD tax obligation to pay even though you have never ""cashed out"" any of your original investment to USD.

Hope this helps!

"Other than the complete halt of the network without it coming back online I honestly don‚Äôt see bitcoin dropping to 0 ever. It can become irrelevant with a lower value if development on it stopped.and the eco system (hodlers/merchant/customers) stopped growing as well. But even then it will have some value and will never die completely. I believe that in that case it will be replaced by another system because this pandora box is already open and the broken debt based fiat system can‚Äôt make it go away.

I honestly believe that we have a bigger chance seen major fiat currencies dropping to 0 (well in terms of purchasing power due to hyperinflation) in the coming decade.

In fact, it's been getting a lot cheaper for banks to provide services in the past 20 years, which is why you now have free bank accounts, free transactions, free pretty much everything that you want from a bank, thanks to competition. Miners do not represent to bitcoin what banks represent to fiat.

You are simply comparing apples to oranges. Bitcoin accounts are safe for now. When tech (or math) advances are inevitably made, they may be vulnerable for at least some time. Swiss bank account is backed by the bank, unless someone invades Switzerland and nukes your bank, that's where your money will be, at least figuratively speaking. The 2 services are something different completely.

Bitcoin's price is designed to be influenced by the market. 2017 has seen some manipulation, some FOMO, some late adopters coming in. But most of all, the price has looked more like a pump and dump scheme rather than a stable, growing currency (which is what you seem to want). ",1526383654

Taxes are based on the gain in market value, and there's a lot of self\-reporting involved.

If you want to invest, say, fiat in some obscure token, and you have to trade through 4\-5 currencies in the same day, the market value probably isn't going to change very much.

"Never heard of Eleet so can't comment specifically on them although a quick google search shows they are closed source iOS messenger app so can't be audited.

It's all about levels or risk/convenience.  For large amounts use a hardware wallet is the only way to do it... you never want to have your bitcoin seed touch an online computer and HW wallets prevent the seed ever being seen by the connected world.  

The lesser secure way is to make sure you have access to your funds without Eleets permission, i.e. you have the seed to where the bitcoin is stored that you can use on say Electrum or other HD wallet.

My hunch is they'll probably be a bitcoin bank though where they hold the funds for you so you need to trust Eleet.  The good thing about bitcoin banks is if they are reputable you may have some insurance if they are hacked/stolen.  The risk is you are Eleet's mercy as to having access to your funds.


i.e. I would never store large amounts on services like Eleet because it's closed source and I doubt you have direct access to the funds.  Buy a HW wallet if you're storing significant sums or worried about keeping them safe.

"Whitepaper Release

Late morning 1st November 2008 (2) emails me.

""It's published,"" (2) said.

""What's published ?"" I ask.

""The Bitcoin white paper,"" (2) said. ""I've published to a crypto mailing list"".

He sent me the link where he'd posted under his Satoshi email adderess.

After reading what he'd posted ( pretty much the Abstract and some supporting text ) I downloaded the Bitcoin White paper pdf file and looked it over.

It seemed pretty much straight forward.

I see he's changed the title to include Bitcoin as the name for the paper.

There's the Satoshi Nakamoto handle to represent us until we were sure it was safe to change it to our own names.

I noticed that he'd inserted his Satoshi email address up there.

There's the Abstract I wrote, when he'd asked me for an Introduction.

There's the Introduction section (2) and (3) wrote using some of the explanations from my previous emails.

""What's with the changed text in the Introduction section ?"" I asked. ""Some of these phrases weren't in the original section you showed me.""

""Oh, that's to cover ourselves if those people that applied for that patent try to [redacted] us over,"" (2) said. ""I took a few phrases from their patent application and put them into the Bitcoin white-paper. Like you said, if they did get some of their ideas from our draft white-paper then all of their peers will notice the same phrases used between ther patent and our white-paper. Their peers will ostracize them from their community and they'll never be trusted in a professional capacity ever again.""

I smiled as I read his reply.

He was learning.

I begin on the sections.

Mmmmm.

Something's not quite right here.

He was supposed to paraphrase the explanations I gave him, but it appears most of the text is exactly how I'd sent it to him.

I notice the images were the ones he'd sent me to confirm that they were correct and agreed with my original images.

Now I know what drawing program he'd used to create the images he'd shown me - they were trimmed screenshots from Adobe Acrobat as he was creating the images directly inside the document.

I read some more and a knot of fear began to rise from the pit of my belly.

The text I'd given him to explain the system was mostly copy and pasted directly from my emails to him when I was figuring this thing out.",1526382145
"I'm not blaming anyone for being convinced about something; someone may as well be pure in their reasoning and heart, but with the current state of the crypto space you need to be really sharp at all times to spot what exactly is going on. I can't do that at all times either.

I think we need to separate the functionality of the TRAC project from their marketing activities to an extent. The project could be great but their marketing activities inevitably supports the way crypto currently works.

As you can see in the link below, they too did an airdrop to gain traction:
https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrail-community-reward-program-get-tokens-of-appreciation-9eca812a770c

And then comes the tricky part where the project might even fall victim to group activities out of their control. They're an upcoming project with potential and they've just gathered a large group of followers through their airdrop and other marketing activities. Amongst those new investors there'll be people who shill, on big and small scale. So whether this post was initiated by the TRAC team itself is almost impossible to track down. It can just be a group of people who are invested and try hard to shill the project so they can sell for profits.

Conclusion, it's the fundamentals of the crypto space that make this happen and actions from most parties can be understood why they do it but altogether we keep this system alive. I don't really see a way to completely get rid of it though. We have price action and mass communication to shill through. The only thing I can think of for us to do is to look at whether news is legitimate and newsworthy or whether it's just shilling and act (comment, up or downvote) accordingly.",1526382103

&gt;In terms of your 1,000 hours, I haven't kept a log but it probably is more than that.


Don't take it personally, but I don't believe you did. Reason is simple, if you did you'd have seen all there is to see. You'd see that the Bitcoin community doesn't really care about BCH and what it does... **unless** those actions are aimed at hurting Bitcoin. Nobody cares, or interacts with any of the other Bitcoin forks - Bitcoin Gold/Diamond/Atom/Private/... because who cares? The only reason why there's hostility towards BCH are the constant attacks on Bitcoin. From the December smear campaign promoted by Roger and his Bitcoin,com pal on various media (CNBC - slow/expensive/unreliable vs fast/cheap/reliable... like a trained parrot), to the BCH pump the day before appearing on Info Wars where he lied about BCH outperforming Bitcoin in the market for months (he's been called out by this very community for it!), to shitting on LN repeatedly, to keep promoting the false narrative that storage space is the issue when he's been told at least two years ago that storage space is NOT the problem, to the most recent confusion aimed campaign that BCH is the real Bitcoin and then some. 

And no, I'm not making false accusations, all of this is documented online.

So you see, you have not spent those 1000hrs or you'd be aware of this, at least most of it anyway. And you fell for the narrative of ""two Bitcoins"", which is EXACTLY what the aim of the campaign was. In that sense, it's been successful, at least in part. Can you see why there's hostility towards BCH? Or better, towards certain individuals behind BCH. But no hostility towards other forks... did you wonder why?

furthermore i believe that its not realistic to say that people in the future will not need mortgages, business loans or personal loans, and i do realise that even if these things can be 'taken over' by whale type palyers in the crypto world, they will require as much information and protection from fraud and failure as banks do right now, and they will base that on the same incentive model but will be less transparent.

"There's one thing you're forgetting and that is history. In order for the chain to be compromised through mining, you would indeed need a majority of the hashrate in order to acquire the longest chain.

However, if you want to change the ledger somewhere in the past, you would need to redo all the work (proof-of-work) since the genesis block, which gets harder and harder the longer time goes by, and thus the chain gets longer.

If we assume someone wants to control the chain (and not kill it), a large hashrate could do it (in theory) but there's the second participant in the ecosystem to avoid a takeover: the nodes. The 'time metaphor' made by another user here some time ago is a good way to explain this. We all have our watches set to 10 AM, we all agree 10 AM is right now, and an hour from now it will be 11 AM. If a malicious actor took over the chain with massive hashpower, he could then decide what time it is. He sais 10 AM is now in fact 4 PM, and we're playing by my rules now. This leaves us with a choice, do we change our watch to 4 AM as well or do we stick to our notion of time? As long as the nodes (aka we) still decide its 10 AM we will continue on our chain, we will fork. And the malicious actor will be sitting on a different and valueless version of the protocol.

Now this is not a perfect analogy and in reality such an event is quite a bit more complicated. While this is theoretically possibly, it most likely won't happen and the reason is economical. You have you're miners and your nodes, but you also have your users. They will still be using and transacting with the Bitcoin that they know, the other chain which was compromised won't have any value and nobody will be using it. So it would be a very expensive endeavour to achieve basically nothing.

To get to your actual question, what will happen to mining once close to or all bitcoins are mined and the blockreward becomes so small that a high value of bitcoin would be required for miners to be incentivized to continue operations. First of, there's fee's. Thats an economical incentive to mine that will never go away. Secondly, nothing states that we must stick with proof-of-work forever. We can decide to switch over to proof-of-stake or another mechanism. Proof-of-work is needed - *initially* - to assure immutability. It is not needed per se once the ecosystem is large enough.

A common misconception is that more hashpower is mandatory, the more valuable bitcoin becomes. *It is not.* With proof-of-work, some miners are always needed. In theory, one is enough (this is how Satoshi began). The chain can be easier compromised when hashpower is low, but as long as we all agree on what time it is, miners or malicious actors can do what they want.

The real danger, in the next 10-20 years is the blockchain clogging. If a large percentage of hashpower were to stop mining right after the difficulty retarget, this could slow the chain to a halt, as the difficulty would be disproportionate to the actual hashpower. This could tank the price, forcing the rest of the miners to also swap their hashpower to a different chain. Hope all that explains it somehow, sorry for the long text, it's an interesting thinking exercise :)",1526380385

But it doesn't.

If bitcoin's value lowers relative to other goods, what happens to the price of the other goods? Before, this loaf of bread cost 0.1 btc. Now bitcoin's value lowers and the loaf of bread costs 0.2btc. Is 0.2&gt;0.1? Yes, therefore the price has risen. ",1526380286

The question about what secures Bitcoin is still open. Satoshi's Bitcoin paper says that if the majority of hashpower belongs to honest miners Bitcoin can be secure. This is probably true. But can we just assume that the majority will be honest?

There needs to be some kind of a justification.

The paper also discusses a scenario where a large amount hashrate is owned by some sort of a potentially dishonest actor, and it says that he will find it more profitable to stick to the protocol.

But this isn't really true. If we assume that this actor has access to a majority of hashpower, an attack can be costless to him, since he will get full block rewards on top of whatever profit he gets to an attack.

So again, why do you assume that Bitcoin is secure?

Another thing to note is that if we assume that Bitcoin miners are _rational_ rather than honest, then a lot of nasty thing can happen. such as [feather forks](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=312668.0).",1526380234

"&gt; Capitalist doesn't just own his own work, he owns other people's work

I can sell my labor if I so choose, *because I own myself*, just as I can sell my paintings or my car.

&gt; as technology advances ... the worker does not get any higher wage,

This is patently false as even a superficial understanding of history would surely make clear to you. During the industrial revolution the average wage of workers went up ~20x due to the increased productivity per labor-hour as afforded by technological advances. The standard of living increased by leaps and bounds, population grew, life expectancy increased, infant mortality decreased - the Malthus limit was destroyed, enormous wealth was *created*.

It's truly amazing to me that someone interested in bitcoin fails to grasp the raison-d'etre of its existence. It's *limited in supply* and not centrally controlled. Fiat money is by design inflationary, a target of 2-4% per year is set (reality is usually higher). This means that your wage or savings lose purchasing power from year to year. E.g. if you save $1000 for 10 years, the equivalent purchasing power of money in future dollars would be (with 4% inflation) $1000*0.96^10= $665. *That* is why the wages (or better, purchasing power) is largely stagnant.

"One of the elements that goes unnoticed with PIVX often (not necessarily a pivacy specific feature - more of a cryptonomic feature) is its coin supply emission and burning.

PIVX COIN SUPPLY AND INFLATION RATE
COIN EMISSION
PIVX has a persistent coin emission like monero and etheruem, meaning it will not stop like bitcoin and some other coins will. It was designed this way because PIVX doesn't have or need miners, so our rewards are paid to people hosting our network (masternodes), people holding the coin and securing the network (stakers), and people working to improve and promote PIVX (treasury). It is a fully self-sustaining economic model which will function indefinitely. 

A perpetual coin emission does not mean we have an infinite supply or any other setup that would devalue the currency. As we will see in the inflation section, PIVX has one of the lowest inflation rates around. In fact, by staking you can not only offset inflation but you can earn at around double the rate of inflation just for holding PIVX.

PIVX COIN EMISSION
Now that zPoS is enabled, PIVX coin emission will create up to 6 piv per block. The breakdown is up to 1 piv for the treasury and 5 piv between masternodes and stakers. If the staker wins the block using zPIV, they will get a 3 piv reward and the masternode will get 2 piv. If the staker wins using normal piv, they will get a 2 piv reward and the masternode will get a 3 piv reward. 

INFLATION AND DEFLATION
On most coins, inflation is as simple as the existing supply plus coin emission, but with PIVX there is another factor to consider. Most coins will pay transaction fees to their miners, which in turn incentivizes the miners to keep fees high. 

PIVX doesn't need miners, so it simply burns fees out of the coin supply.

This means the fees are kept at their absolute minimum and each burned fee actually causes some deflation. People are sensitive to the inflation rate of a coin because inflation represents the devaluation of your coin. Conversely, deflation would increase the value of your coins. This is all a function of supply and demand.

For an idea of the inflation rate, accounting for only coin emission and not coin burn, [check this chart to see how PIVX compares to other coins](https://i.imgur.com/LQSG84M.png)

A good example of this kind of deflation is [block 863788](http://www.presstab.pw/phpexplorer/PIVX/block.php?blockhash=f0fcd7a433d3f4bef632af256918b7f38507e31a6e0d68404f075b1b0742b787) from when the automint was activated. This block minted 5 new piv and contained 798 transactions minting zPIV with a 0.01 piv fee per mint. That gives us about 7.96 piv burned in fees, meaning the coin supply decreased by about 2.96 piv that block. This block is of course an outlier at this point in time, but it is a good example of deflation that has already happened.

[This burn projection chart](https://i.imgur.com/4Liz5Pc.png) shows the estimated amount of transactions required before we see deflation as outlined above. It assumes about 50% are zPIV mints or SwiftX spends with a fee of 0.01. As we can see, our already low inflation rate goes completely flat at around 15 transactions per second. This is only about double the throughput bitcoin is currently struggling with. As shown in the block above, we have already managed 79 transactions per second in a block and the masternodes can scale to handle magnitudes more than that. What this means is that PIVX will even be deflationary long before bitcoin is.

STAKING
On top of all this, PIVX allows you to easily stake your piv/zPIV and earn rewards at about double the rate of inflation. Before accounting for fees burned out of supply, coin emission only creates about 4% inflation that tails off towards 0%.  However, just by staking, you can earn about 8% to 15% annually in staking rewards.

"I want to help my uncle be able to set his brick and mortar store front up to accept bitcoin, how do I do it ?

Bitcoin inflates and deflates massively every day. That's kind of its thing,1526379612
"I am just trying to help. When first heard about bitcoin in 2011 I told myself: Alright go and read that whitepaper. But I never really did. It was hard to understand. It looked like a challenge. I skimmed through it. But I never dived deep into it. Around 2013 I kind of lost interest. In 2015 I had interest again. Then the scaling debate started to happen. I thought bought sides had good arguments .. but really all I thought was that both sides had arguments that LOOKED good. In reality, I had no idea. nullc would say something that looked smart and then I was like: yeah nullc you tell em. Then Gavin would say something that also looked smart and I would be like: hmm who is right and who is wrong. 

It was kind of stuck until 2017. Maybe October/ November. Not too long ago. The BCH fork had already happened and I still really did not know who was right and who was wrong. Small blockers vs big blockers. Eventually, this got really frustrating. So I dove as deep in the white paper as I could. And I finally got a complete grasp on the whitepaper. I got the mechanism of how and why bitcoin works. I then used https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/ and I read everything that Satoshi ever wrote. 

Now my insight is very rudimentary. Just like you, I am not a coder. I always thought: well I can't say anything to these guys because they code and I don't. Everything I believe in Bitcoin was based on some kind of authority. They were smart, they figured it out. I would listen to them. Then the authorities in Bitcoin started disagreeing and the community split apart. Now what?

Well, there was no other option than to be done with authorities and figure that shit out for me. It was no easy. And my insight is still very shallow but I know enough now so I can defend my own position easily. 

One day over at /r/dataisbeautiful I [wrote this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/7erxlj/bitcoin_mining_now_consuming_more_electricity/dq794rv/)  

I got a lot of gold for that and the 4 other posts I posted beneath each other. 

I also was able to explain a little bit of how Bitcoin works to my father. When I explained how the network adjusts the difficulty so you have a feedback system and the distribution of coins keeps it self-stable that way my dad was impressed. He still does not get every part but that part I was able to explain to him. 

I am not trying to insult you, just trying to figure out who much knowledge you have. If you don't understand the complete mechanism you won't know what the parts are for and if you don't understand all the part of the engine that Satoshi designed you won't ever understand the complete mechanism.

There is no other way, you will have to do deep into the whitepaper until you understand what was build and what was not build. 

The key component in Bitcoin is simply this:

For the people in the network that don't have to trust each other, it's magnitudes more profitable to play by the rules of the network than to try to attack the network by breaking them. 

That's the human aspect that the code can't say anything about. 

Anyways, I hope you will keep on searching for the truth. Anybody that is willing to spend a lot of time and afford into understanding this can understand it. 

If you think the whitepaper is an onion with infinite layers you simply never went deep enough.  ",1526379591

*(2) had been on the periphery of the cypherpunks group since the mid 1990‚Äôs. When I entered the project in early 2008 he had been working on the problem part-time over the past five years. Over the previous year or so he‚Äôd been working on the problem full-time. He was writing a white paper for an e-cash system for the online betting/gambling company to use ( or to license out the solution to multiple companies ) plus writing the code for it.*

*He was attempting to implement a working example of electronic cash.*

*There were other cryptographers who he was communicating with however it just wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúwork‚Äù. There were always too many attack vectors with the solution and even though, from a cryptographic point-of-view, the white paper and code was appropriate, he found it unsatisfactory.*

*12th March 2008 (2) asks (3) to help with his white paper and code.*

(...)

*(2) wanted to publish the white paper before the end of the year (2008).*

There were tons of ads for fake sites, so they banned them.  Google is not gonna stay on top of the hundreds of new ICO's monthly to make sure that people don't hit a scammer.

I am also completely and totally opposed to the tactics many in Core have either contributed to, or been silent about: [link](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/informative_btc_vs_bch_articles/dl8v4lp/?st=jaotbt8m&amp;sh=222ce783)

From another of your comments:

&gt; The centralisation of nodes with bigger blocks

This is largely a myth being used to scare people away from BCH. Bitcoin originally had 32 mb blocks, with plans to increase them later as needed. This was 9 years ago. 1mb blocks were never meant to be permanent. Latency was always the real limit, never storage. Satoshi himself said that most people should never have to run a full node, and that it was never the intended configuration for large scale:

&gt; ""The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate."" -Satoshi Nakamoto [source](https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/bitcointalk/287/#selection-21.3-21.412)


A really good video was made about this very topic (myths of nodes and decentralization) just a couple weeks ago. Take a look:

"IMHO I never stopped a while to think the about the implications of raising the block size to 8MB, though for what I've read, the main problem seems to be that if 8MB blocks where to be filled with transactions, it would be a trouble for average PCs to process. Also 8MB is not even enough if bitcoin where to become mainstream for everyone to use it. Raising the block size even more would cause centralization, as only big servers would be able to process such blocks. Just to keep rising the block size is not a long-term solution.

Nevertheless, that is not the main reason why I refuse to use Bitcoin Cash. The main reason why I refuse to use Bcash is because of the way the main community representatives like Roger Ver are advertising it. It's common to find misleading info in their social media. Roger Ver for example has said things like ""blocks are not consensus"" or ""only miners are full nodes, any other node is slowing down the network"" which are provably wrong from a technical point of view and seem to try to stop people running their own full nodes which would defeat the main point of bitcoin, to be decentralized. Following the cases of misleading posts, the @bitcoin twitter handle (which nobody really knows who is the owner, but by the posts you can clearly say it's in favour of Bitcoin Cash) had posted a tweet suggesting that Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin and that the Bitcoin that we all know is the one that forked. I'm pretty sure lots of people still remember that 1st of august 2017, the day that Bitcoin Cash forked-off Bitcoin to rise the block size, you can still find lots of news headlines from that day talking about it with a quick google search.
Furthermore, both Roger Ver and @bitcoin on twitter, are heavily advertising the bitcoin(dot)com web page, which is seen by lots of people as an outright scam because the way it attempts to confuse and melt the definitions of Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin. Lots of people blame it for things like calling ""Bitcoin Core"" to the Bitcoin we all know to create confusion, when in reality, Bitcoin Core is just one out of many implementations of the Bitcoin protocol. Even for a while, in their exchange Bitcoin Cash (BCH) used to be listed as just ""Bitcoin"" (many people claim to have lost money into that trick) but it was later removed after a collective started a process to sue them.
In the end, what they get is to confuse people into thinking that the Bitcoin that they've heard of, then one that went over $10000 a while ago, the one that many people and all their friends are speaking of is Bitcoin Cash, they get people to think that Bitcoin cash is the *real* Bitcoin.

So, sumarizing, the main reason why I refuse to use Bcash is because this blatant misleading advertising methods. I will not use it until they stop using such advertising methods. If they belive that 8MB block size is the future, then they should proove it to me using honest methods, then, and only then, I'll spend at least a whole day thinking about it.",1526374397

"Your ""answer"" is not much of an answer at all because 1) we're not talking exclusively about 'the market', we're talking about facts about technology and a multitude of others things as well. Trusting Warren buffet or Bill Gates would lead you to believe that you should get out of crypto. (so maybe you should) and 2) ""all variables constant"" including the brain states of each individual would yield the same exact advice. See how your dumb Talebism is just vague and meaningless? It doesn't stand up to scrutiny.

Crypto and it's value, are indicative of people's trust in the underlying technology, Blockchain. Blockchain has potential benefits for FB and Google (Alphabet nowadays) but they are vastly outnumbered by one huge tech that may make their business very difficult and that's tying personal data into a blockchain, making FB and google add entries everytime the data is accessed, or sold, or used as part of Adsense. Something to that effect...

This would give us complete control over our personal data and give them accountability for what they do with that data. Not a picture they want to see, so they throw their weight behind calling crypto's a sham.. this should just tell us that it's working, we're headed in the right direction and we're pressing buttons they maybe didn't know they had.",1526373158

Go back and read to find out. 


&gt;That's why I said ""all other things being equal."" Why get so angry about it?

All things being equal? As in what? They have identical brains and one inherited a fortune and one didn't? Do you honestly not see how stupid this claim is?

&gt;Where did I say that? If history is any indicator likely only the minority will understand, but it is hardly a select group.

Lol, okay dude. Yeah big blocks are really hard to understand and only a minority can understand the complexity of raising a limit parameter. Super advanced stuff.

&gt;I can see the net worth discussion is really getting to you. Maybe try and relax a bit.

It's not. It's just unreal that you think net worth is at all relevant to the validity of ideas. It's shockingly amateurish behavior and you cannot seem to spot the logical flaws. 

&gt;I'm flattered you compare me to Taleb and Ayn Rand 

Yikes.

&gt;Why do you seem to dislike Rand, by the way?

Lol, I'm not taking the bait. I'm not your educator or your ethical guide. If you find value in Ayn Rand then good for you. I can only laugh and shake my head. Again, your propensity to buy into pseudo-intellectual hand waving is alarming. But do as you please. It's not my job to explain the absurdity and indecency of Ayn Rand.

&gt; One way of distilling Taleb's thesis is to say that all other things being equal (perhaps pay attention this time before going off on a silly tangent about young inheritors and poor, enlightened acetics), those with skin in the game will tend to produce better results than those who do not, because there is more at stake for them. Conversely, holding a real stake is a good proxy for real competence in a given domain.

Please stop citing Taleb. He's a hack and you're making a fool of yourself. His ideas are not rooted in rigorous thought and analysis, they merely consist of hand-wavy platitudes. It's nonsense wrapped up as fancy pop-sci. Find a new hero.

&gt;I will just assume since you didn't answer properly that you answer to the question regarding net worth is that you would entrust your investment decision with the 100MM USD guy rather than the 0.02 BTC guy, all other things being equal of course.

Here we go again. What the fuck does ""all things being equal"" mean? This is such pseudo-scientific trash.

I'm done. I'm not taking the bait here further. Go ahead and worship Rand and Taleb if you want. Go ahead an masturbate over your *supposed* net worth. I really just don't care. Your arguments are nonsense and you constantly rely on personal attacks and character assassinations to stifle actual conversation. I have to think that the likes of intelligent and thoughtful posters in this sub, like /u/JustSomeBadAdvice, /u/capt_roger_murdock, /u/lubokkanev and even /u/mrtest001, look at your behavior here with much cringe. Your total lack of intellectual honesty and complete lack of social standards do not lend themselves to a convincing redditor. For someone who want so convince people that BCH is a better project, you sure do a terrible job. Your arguments are merely personal attacks and strange assertions about the correlation between net worth and great intelligence. There is simply not enough time in the world to respond to all these falsehoods and fallacies. I simply cannot respond to this drivel any longer.

"&gt; For instance, did you notice that it takes much longer to ""recover"", ever since dominance has fallen that significantly? Bitcoin used to recover in a month ... now it's over 5 months and we're still unsure as to when we can reach that original ATH of 20k. You see what I'm saying?
&gt; 
&gt; Why is this year, as rough as the MtGox year, where 80% of the daily volume got hacked?
&gt; 
&gt; No bad event happened really. Google and FB banned Crypto. We had some FUD from Asian countries, does that really relate that much to the recovery, or is there maybe another reason, as to why it takes so long for Bitcoin to recover? Maybe, it's because it's simply too heavy, and simply not interesting enough. The reason we're at 8k Bitcoin and not 30k Bitcoin is because people are spread in ICO trash, including me.

"Yes as much as we want to scream ‚Äúmuh technology muh financial industry disruptor‚Äù the #1 priority for all of us here is $$$.

Right now 99.9% of coin holders are investing, not using.

Look at how many coins are trying to tap in to places like Africa, Southeast Asia, Middle East from those who don‚Äôt have the freedom of financial stability and how it **can** work to help them. Well, it‚Äôs just not there yet. Once it does get there, it will contribute to more bull runs. But we need to focus on more adoption first to make it logical for there to be higher prices.

The example you gave for VEN, and this is speaking for any Blockchain as a Service coin, is that those benefiting from the Blockchain itself from the BaaS coin would be those creating demand farther than just speculation. Ex for VeChain, those who wants to use VeChains supply IOT technology need to buy THOR (when mainnet launches) consistently to access the chain or at an enterprise level hold VEN that generates THOR on a daily basis. Of course that‚Äôs just the example for VEN specific, can‚Äôt speak for every BaaS.

TL:DR: Coins need more adoption / people need to find convenience in using crypto over fiat (wont be specifically hard in countries that NEED it, but will be tougher in developed countries that hold 90%+ of all GDP). BaaS need to have legitimate enterprise use case to bring in big money at a constant rate to keep demand up over just speculation.

"Hello jeremyscats,


As stated already we suggest you start with the white paper of bitcoin just to reference where it all began. If you want to go even further back in history we suggest you also take a look at the **Hashcash** white paper [here](http://www.hashcash.org/papers/). The bitcoin mining function is based on this paper. 

From there on we suggest you use the book **Mastering Bitcoin** by Andreas Antonopoulos to reference more detailed information on bitcoin and the basis of cryptocurrencies. 

To get a more diverse outlook on cryptocurrencies we suggest you also use this paper on Ethereum [here](https://bravenewcoin.com/assets/Whitepapers/Ethereum-A-Secure-Decentralised-Generalised-Transaction-Ledger-Yellow-Paper.pdf+&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=nl&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=es). Finally [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7163021/) you can find a paper that discusses the upgrades suggested for the bitcoin network. Anonymity protocols of several other cryptocurrencies are discussed and this paper will help you get more understanding of the crypto space in general.

We hope these papers will give you a good basis for creating your speech.

With kind regards,

The Anycoin Direct team

"3 years huh. I'm really just bearish short-term, because I don't see the 35% pushing 100% of the market playing out. I see ICOs being useless theory projects for the future, that have no adoption right now. That's why I think we could see another crash, short-term.


And even then, that might not even happen at all, if BTC finds power. 



The reason why I'm so bearish, is because I simply cannot come up with a good answer, as to why Bitcoin would continue to increase in value.


It used to always increase, because it was essentially the only thing. Now people can ""get rich"" with many many different coins, so people spread and no longer pull the same rope, so to speak. 

In such a scenario, Bitcoin would become interesting again, if the market crashes and all ICOs are exposed as useless, but I really don't see that happening either.


According to how I see the market, we did bullrun for nine years, because we pulled the same rope. Now that Bitcoin is heavy to push and options are endless, how do you keep pushing Bitcoin upwards? 


Have you ever seen a stock, that moves sideways for years? They most of the time either go up or down. People, like yourself, are mostly in it for the money, it's mostly speculators now, as opposed to people using these things.  Your VEN is an exchange ticker, you do not use it, right? 


Of course I'm also praying for another run, where BTC somehow pushes past old levels and we're all getting money. But I don't know. I just don't see it play out this time around. The best hope I have is that somehow Consensus manages to push and hold Bitcoin past 10k. That way we'll get media exposure, which would push it even higher, short-term. Course I hope that will happen, but I just don't. 

Sell pressure is simply too high and Bitcoin is not interesting enough. 

It's possible that I'm not giving Bitcoin enough credit. It's the strongest Crypto for a reason and it has done magical stuff over the years, and those never really made sense, from a financial perspective. Let's hope it continue to be invincible, we all profit form a strong Bitcoin, honestly.",1526371557

However, 3+ years later, they are nowhere near being ready, and may never be. This is largely because LN by its very nature presents problems that there are not any known solutions to. Additionally, even if LN worked and was ready to go on a global scale, it would require blocks of several hundred megabytes, or else would be extremely centralized (it would still be centralized either way though). Lastly, LN is not a part of bitcoin. It is more like a luggage rack for a car; something to be put on top of bitcoin. Even if LN were ready, it would work better on a coin like BCH. To make a long story short, and to answer your question, LN is still years away from **large scale** and **practical** use, if at all.

"&gt;&amp;gt;This is exactly the same thing for the BCH DAA.

&gt;Yes, it is. What is different is that BCH has changed the DAA twice during the life of its chain. 

Ok but is it a significant change?

You said yourself that faster than normal inflation in BTC is not significant, so surely you agree it is not a significant change?

Then what are the significant change between BCH and BTC?

&gt;Although the difficulty target is still linked to the entirety of the chain, validating it involves the extra complication of accounting for the changes.

PoW between change is compared via cumulative PoW.

Cumulative PoW is not affected by the DAA.

(Though I don‚Äôt understand the necessity of comparing work between two separate chain, beside just monitoring or currency comparisons... there is protocol level need or usefulness for that)

&gt;&amp;gt; I agreed that BCH inflation schedule was disrupted, do you agree that BTC inflation schedule is too fast?

&gt;I suppose by your definition of ""too fast"" it may be so. 

&gt;In my opinion the absolute time is far less important than the per-block inflation rate. 

Nobody can change per block inflation rate, it is part of the consensus code. It hasn‚Äôt been changed in BCH (if it‚Äôs what you are implying).

&gt;So long as the difficulty adjustment rate is sufficient to compenstate for improvement in hardware and interest in mining, while still supporting the goal of enduring the honest chain outgrows any competing chain, the actual time over which the fixed inflation occurs is rather arbitrary.

No, the target is 10min and is written in the code.

BTC DAA fail constantly at targeting 10min.

That lead to violation of the inflation schedule to a much larger degree than BCH over the long term.

&gt;&amp;gt;Can you explain how?
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;For both chain equality, if attack BCH will raise much faster.

&gt;When under a 51%+ attack a chain's difficulty will not necessarily increase. 

I agree 

&gt;The attacker only needs to out work the honest miners by a slim margin, and they are free to manipulate the timing data in their blocks to minimize their impact on difficulty. It is in the attacker's interest to do so, since if they cause the difficulty to increase, it would take them that much more work per-block.

The cost of 51% attack only depends on how much hash rate you need to reach that level.

If BCH hash is inferior than bitcoin core it will be easier to attack it.

Having a lover difficulty is irrelevant to it.

In such scenarios i think it is much more likely BCH will get higer hash rate as it will return to a functional currency much quicker (and miner will not have to wait for weeks to get their rewards)


&gt;BCH's fast-adjustment DAA would result in a rapid drop in difficulty, making it less expensive per-block to censor the honest miners. 

Per-block is irrelevant, you can censor Transactions in one block if you don‚Äôt have 51% hash rate (basically forcing a soft fork on the network to orphan any block containing that tx) it will have no effect.


Only if the attack got 51% this attack is doable, whatever is on BTC or BCH and whatever the difficulty.

So I agree BCH will be cheaper to attack **only** if it is supported by less hash rate. 

Difficulty will affect the rate of block each chain will produce but not their resistance to 51% attack (depends on each chain hash rate).

&gt;BTC would not adjust as quickly. The attacker must continue to expend the high amount of effort required to meet the high difficulty for each block they seek to censor. 

Not necessarily high, just higher that the current hash rate supporting bitcoin core after the drop.

If after the drop, only 100Mh support bitcoin core, then anyone in possession of 101Mh can 51% BTC. 

No matter how high the difficulty or how long it takes to find blocks..

(Though at that level there probably no point attacking it anymore)

&gt;And I'd be ok with that. If 80% of the hash power became hostile - or even disappeared with the high risk of becoming hostile - confidence in the chain's future reliability would be severely undermined.

Not hostile, **lost**

Nothing can be done against 80% hash rate going hostile.",1526370384

Seriously market cap is nothing but a meaningless number, you are talking about actual usage where xrp acts as vessel of value: the higher the price the less xrp needed to complete the transaction, no matter how much the transaction would be, but as xrp would gain more and more volume the price of xrp has to move up to be able to cover the volumes.

"I'm copying and pasting this here as a reply so it's not a reply to a downvoted child comment:

&gt; There are real technical reasons it's ... overengineered

1) It accepts address hashes for lengths between 160 bits and 512 bits, which is cool, except for the fact that no scriptPubKey in use creates sighashes that are more than 160 bits.  I don't even know if you can create a valid scriptPubKey that will be accepted by a node that uses sighashes that are more than 512 bits.    I'm not sure it's even possible to do with the set of opcodes currently supported in BCH. Even after the hardfork.  OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY certainly won't work.  There's simply no use case for this functionality....

However, such cashaddrs and the functionality must be supported by a parser, even though they cannot be used on the BCH network and cannot be converted to legacy addresses.

2) the prefix seperator chosen is "":"", which means that bitcoin addresses in URLs have to be escaped in order to be parsed.  Which one looks better:  `https://blockchain.info/address/13usM2ns3f466LP65EY1h8hnTBLFiJV6rD` or `https://blockdozer.com/address/bitcoincash%3Aqq07l6rr5lsdm3m80qxw80ku2ex0tj76vvsxpvmgme`

This problem could have been avoided by choosing an alphanumeric prefix seperator like bech32 did, or simply using something else like '.'

3) a base32 alphanumeric address was chosen with both CashAddr and bech32 so that addresses could use up fewer bits in a QR code.  However, the cashaddr also added so many characters that the QR code is no smaller.
[a version 3M QR code](https://www.thonky.com/qr-code-tutorial/character-capacities) is the smallest size big enough to hold a legacy address in byte mode, so we'd hope that the new format that can be shown in QR alnum mode would allow a smaller version...but NOPE...clocking in at 54 characters, the smallest version allowed to encode `bitcoincash:qq07l6rr5lsdm3m80qxw80ku2ex0tj76vvsxpvmgme` is:  ...3M.   D'oh.

Making the prefix ""bch"" or ""tbch"" instead of ""bitcoincash"" would have made the length go from 54 to 46, which would have *actually* allowed a smaller code.

&gt; It introduces a few compatibility and usability bugs. 

4) Usability bugs: the choice of a non-alphanumeric separator means that an entire address can no longer be copied and pasted in a single click action on many platforms, particularly on mobile.   In addition, many platforms on PC and mobile 
correctly parse the prefixed address as a URI (because it correctly parses like one according to the URI standard) and tries to launch an intent when it's copied and pasted.  Again, this could have been fixed by an alphanumeric seperator.

5) Compatibility bug: cashaddr format *is* a URI, so it cannot simply be embedded into the proper position in a BIP21 style bitcoin URI and reuse the same bitcoin BIP21 URI generator code...if the wallet does, it will double prefix it.

Instead, the spec explicitly requires that anywhere a BIP21 style URI appears, to strip the prefix (more on that later) or better, to rewrite the wallet code to morph the address *into* the bip21 URI by appending the correct information.  This is a lot of code duplication and work for all wallets and services in the ecosystem.   

6) Compatibility bug: addresses now all have to be URI quoted and cannot be stored in an ""ALNUM"" type in many databases or other such mediums that require it.  This is a small issue because addresses should probably be parsed and validated before storing anyway in order to follow good engineering principles, but this could be deleted.

7) If the prefix is stripped, parsing it correctly/validating it correctly against the checksum to find out which network the address applies to is very computationally complex and code-complex, requiring guess-and-check against known prefix types.
Good thing the prefix is optional /s. There's no way to distinguish between a checksum error because of an invalid prefix (say the address is on testnet) and a checksum error because of a mistyped letter.

8) Not just checksum computation, but it actually includes *error correction* in the address.  Which sounds like a feature at first until you realize that an implementation actually *using it* could upgrade your failure to validate error into a correctly validated but loss-of-funds
address.  This is why the spec warns repeatedly against implementations using this automatically, but why include a feature which *allows* a spec to introduce a loss of funds automatically, when you could simply use a checksum (like legacy) that doesn't include error correction and make it impossible for implementations to lose funds?

A lot of this stuff is bugs or extra work for maintainers of wallets and all the other software in the ecosystem that is critical for adoption.  Work that could have been avoided by simply changing the legacy address version pkh and sh prefixes like litecoin did, which would have helped adoption.

Firstly, you mischaracterized my position, which is not, as you say, that ASICs aren't centralizing. If you can't even get my position right, then I owe you no such explanation.

"Ok I see your point and believe me I am very happy and open for a neutral discussion. 

So your point is that xCurrent is doing the actual transfer and banks don't care about liquidity problems or countries and governments aren't concerned with inflating cash stuck in n/v accounts?

The thing is if you actually read up, xCurrent ties and integrates neatly with xVia API and with xRapid the liquidity software\(the one you claim will never be used, you know because there is no need\). 

You are mistaken my friend with a few things. 

first of all, internet of value is not complete, the ILP is what is actually going to drive the internet of value concept where everything is interconnected to RippleNet and you can trade any crypto, fiat, assets, gold etc. using it where XRP is the fastest native asset also most attack safe and tightest integrated. 

xCurrent is going through normal pairs of fiat IOU type concepts and hence it will take more time, which I don't think is the real problem, the real problem is the liquidity already has to be there in the n/v account form and this is more like an upgrade to the existing swift system if you like. 

Look up how much big banks tranfer globally every day, now know that using XRP for liquidity, it's not only time, its 30\-60&amp;#37;\(depending on each use\-case and software suite each end\) more savings bank save \(which they dont have to pass down to you, they can keep a portion of savings as profit too\) and also makes it more safer for them going via ripple net as the standard crypto concepts then apply. 

So yes some banks may decide No thanks we are happy with just xCurrent and this is probably the case today for many. This is why Ripple is focusing on other Fis and payment providers at the moment, to show the banks the savings. 

These payment providers like Mecury FX have confirmed going to PROD soon with XRP or Xrapid, debunking your claims ""it will never be used"". 

Others soon will follow with codius and xPring backed companies using XRP ledger.

Banks is still the end game, and yes it is quite possibly that only a few out of 100s they work with will use it, but look at how much money is tied up in n/v accounts, the falling USD, the petro yuan and look at the big picture. Really high level. This is not about little crypto coin holders fighting for their little holdings, this is really at a higher level about releasing some money whilst giving banks incentives in terms of savings for doing so. 

Ripple is the biggest bag holder, and on pure speculation, this market that is bound to get some regulations soon won't make Ripple the greedy evil company\(as you like to see it\) rich. So look again, they are genuinely doing great work in promoting blockchain in general and making a protocol for all to use, XRP just is the fastest as ofcourse they want to make money too and keep funding future XRP work.

I love how everyone thinks companies will use brand x or y shitcoin to achieve their institutional goals. Blockchains don't have to have anything to do with crypto and I'd stay far and away from cryptos if I were running a logistics giant. No sense in worrying about all of the garbage in this space when you can have your own private ledger and track shipments without unnecessary exposure to the garbage pile that is the current crypto space. ,1526368408
"Bitcoin is not inflation proof money, inflation comes in the form of alts/forks. The creation of money out of thin air is unregulated and even worse in cryptocurrencies.",1526368361
"What do you mean non-standard? What other standard measures of inflation are there other than the two I listed: 

Money supply inflation where the base money supply increases, as Bitcoin will for our lifetime. Or price inflation where the cost of goods increase relative to the price of the currency.

I don't understand how you can say it's 'inflation-proof' in the first sentence and then specifically refer to the inflation it undergoes in the second sentence and say that what I'm saying would be non-standard.

If people want to invent some new term to decribe the uniqueness of Bitcoin's predictable money supply inflation, that would probably be a good idea. But people have been calling it 'deflationary', 'non-inflationary', or 'inflation-proof' for years by mistake when it doesn't mean any of those definitions as defined by to what inflation refers to in both of it's historical usages.

&gt;Interesting how you just single out Taleb and don't address the idea of skin in the game. Perhaps if you will not answer the ASIC question, you will answer this one: all other things being equal, who would you rather trust to make good investment decisions on yoru behalf, someone with a net worth of 100MM USD or someone with a net worth of 0.02 BTC?

What does software design have to do with net worth? Are you being sarcastic here? Also, just for the record I have more than .02, again, not that that should matter, but just to clear that concern of yours. How much do you have? If you can't tell me (and prove it) then your should at least realize how incredibly hypocritical you're being. Show us some tax records of stfu about net worth.

The existence of bitcoin is depended on a well functioning and technological advanced civilization. A systemic failure of an size that it could not be contained by the global insurance system and world governments would render the bitcoin blockchain meaningless.

"&gt; I see your point. I think short term I will slowly shave away at my XVG holdings because it does take a HUGE percent of my portfolio, even for a ""risky gamble"" coin. Long term, once it has better days, which I only need it to be for a snip of time, I will cash a majority if not all out for more stable high mk coins, or BTC like you suggest.


The thing with XVG and why people tell you to drop it, is because it's potentially a scam. Not because they're garbage, which they're too, but they could also be a scam. I could do a quick summary on why they're maybe a scam. That's the thing. Swap that position from a scam Altcoin, to a regular Altcoin, where is the problem? Returns are equal with any other coin, since they're all somewhat pegged to Bitcoin anyways. 


&gt; Vechain i invested in due to my own research before I met the beautiful /r/CryptoCurrency because I liked the professionalism, partnerships, development team, and the fact that it has room to grow (I invested when it wasn't a top 20 coin). I think it's got a good use case and room to grow, so I'll roll with it for now (maybe down the line ill slowly remove my position for some other coins, we will have to play it by ear).

I don't know man. Not my thing. But each their own and you said you have done your research, so you should go with that, of course. I just personally don't like their permanent advertisements on Reddit, that makes me suspicious, not more. 


&gt; WAX, XZC, RDD, GNT etc. make up &lt; 15% of my portfolio so I am not worried. All generally low market cap compared to my other investments so if one pops off, I'll be happy.

Fine. Gamble. If Bitcoin drops, you know these are the ones ensuring insane losses. Observe the market, Bitcoin specificically. I'm really bearish, past Consensus, but we'll see. Maybe we're lucky and there's another run possible, before another major correction.

&gt; XLM and XRP, although are more centralized, have the most real use cases and can continue to gain adoption where it matters, the banking systems. Crypto in my opinion will co-exist with the banking systems so this is gonna be a really good bet imo.


Agree, centralized, but at least they're used for something. That's already much more most Altcoins will ever amount to. Ripple being paypal 2.0 or whatever, they're totally fine. Also very prone however, to swings within Bitcoin - not an Alt that does hold its value nicely, when BTC falls. For example ETH holds their value much better, if Bitcoin drops. 


&gt; Good last point, another bear market down into the $6K will shit my portfolio, maybe I need to hedge a bit of bitcoin from some of my over-invested coins. Thanks for the advice, will take into account.


Gotta understand how it's all conncected to Bitcoin. Bitcoin decides where we go, we gotta acknolwedge that. Bitcoin used to always increase value and bullrun for nine years, because it had the dominance to do so. Now it's 35% of the marketcap, but they're the sole decider as to whether 100% of the market goes up or down. Personally not sure if that dynamic can play out. Think it's highly required that we flush down Crypto, so that sanity returns within investors. Dominance for me is a rationality scala and most ICO projects are too early to be relevant, in my opinion. 

In a bearish scenario, you'd ideally be holding Tether, to avoid high fees by going into real Euro. Or you're shorting, but that's insanely dangerous, given it's Crypto. If you could swap any other Alt for XVG, without fees, on binance, would you do it? I'll give you the BNB required to execute that trade for free. 


The thing is really they're maybe a scam. You don't want to lose your money holding a scam, right? I don't know, just my thoughts.",1526367859

"His basic point is that BAT made $30M in their ICO a year ago and yet their product still sucks. I think that‚Äôs a fair assessment for most projects so far too, I mean at least BAT have a shipped product but like all the others that have done so they too also have hardly spent any time working on improving the terrible user experience that is current day crypto and they seemed to have partnered with someone whose ethos does not match the spirit of decentralization that BAT are trying to sell us on making the product even worse. 

These companies need to do better, they need better executive management who will hire good product people and good UI/UX people and they need to focus on usability not profit, then maybe crypto will get more mainstream traction. Right now it still feels like a bunch of Engineers dealing only with the tech and forgetting about UX whilst the business people fall back on traditional deals and fee structure to make money losing sight of the long term goal.
