"As a UX UI designer I have been approached by several crypto companies looking to design their product but non of them seem to set aside any realistic budget. The problem is that nobody from these teams understands design and think we just exist to make shit look pretty. It is a fucking joke to see what teams who have raised millions offer for design projects. 

Designers are the rock stars of crypto projects. Let me say that again. DESIGNERS are the rock stars of crypto projects. Not the shitty dribbble ones who make pretty shit but pros who make shit usable. It doesn't matter what kind of a super duper crypto project you create with your highly overpaid developers, if the thing is not usable by an average Joe then your product ain't going nowhere. If you are a team reading this, get that through your thick skulls. And don't fucking pm me for work, I don't pm me for work, I don't work for free.",1523257064
"One problem I have is the name...it’s literally btc being held by a group that is anti-btc.  It is extremely fortunate that the mods do allow pro-btc content here or it would actually be objectively worse than what you would expect pro-btc guys to do. 

 I understand that it is being kept because of name recognition, but what would you say if the /bch subreddit was held by anti bch people, and bch becomes popular enough that people come to reddit looking for information about BCH and, understandably, go to /bch only to become extremely confused when presented with a community that is trying to explain that ‘not BCH’ is better?

Moderation and control of /bitcoin seems arguable and justifiably more contentious, but when the trading names are literally BTC and BCH, complaining that pro BTC comments in /btc are trolls seems ridiculous.",1523256996

"&gt;If the difficulty gets adjusted downward due to what the Selfish Miner is doing then you just reversed the problem. Now honest mining at the new lower difficulty is that much more profitable. 

It is not because the honest miners are having a greater than normal amount of their blocks orphaned both before and after the difficulty adjustment. See my [toy example](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8avoa3/psa_i_have_been_down_the_sm_rabbit_hole_for_weeks/dx239za/) here.",1523256890
"Cryptocurrency is inherently linked to cryptography and keys. Its primary benefits are undermined by oversimplifications or an all-powerful third party who protects you from yourself. We already have that model, and it's called a bank.

When you screw up your iTunes library, you can just resync, reorganize and redownload. When you screw up highly secure money and lock yourself out or get it stolen, there is no such recourse. So when you're the sole party in control of funds, there is a minimum required knowledge to prevent total loss. It absolutely cannot be responsibly dumbed down beyond that point. And when you're not the sole party, you've created counterparty risk and/or a situation where an authority could choose to freeze your funds. The absence of these properties during normal, intended usage is one of the key features and purposes of crypto.",1523256837

"An ASIC is basically a piece of software that is implemented directly on hardware. A normal computer has a set of operations it can perform, and a computer program is simply like a recipe that says 'do this, do that, add this to that, etc'. This is very flexible and convenient, but also relatively slow because a computer can only do relatively generic things.

An ASIC otoh can be 'baked' to implement those specific operations in hardware, on-chip. So it takes your input, feeds it into specific circuits that do all the dedicated computations, and then writes it in the output field. This is extremely fast, but also extremely specific. An ASIC can do only 1 thing, forever. If the algorithm changes, like monero now did, Those ASIC's all become worthless.

ASIC solutions are also relatively expensive to create so they are generally used only for operations that are always the same, such as for example MP4 encoding, Bitcoin mining, etc.",1523256615
"If the difficulty gets adjusted downward due to what the Selfish Miner is doing then you just reversed the problem.  Now honest mining at the new lower difficulty is that much more profitable.  So you slightly change the problem, but when you account for the increased profits to honest mining at the lowered difficulty then you still get no gain for the SM.  You can't keep comparing the Selfish Miner to the Honest Miner before the Selfish Miner started his shenanigans.  Take everything into account and compare the profits.  If you drastically lower difficulty then honest mining becomes drastically more profitable.  Bitcoin is a lever.  Push one side down, the other goes up.  That's what makes it work, how it balances incentives.  I feel like almost everyone in crypto (and apparently a lot of this sub) has forgotten that it is through incentives that Bitcoin set itself apart.

"&gt;The name is of the consensus network. There is only one Bitcoin, and it is determined by the free market. 

The free market is not a 51% monopoly. A free market means different groups can have different opinions on what Bitcoin is.

Bitcoin is an open source project, and no one has a trademark it. Anyone has a right to call their own project Bitcoin, and promote their own vision for what Bitcoin represents.

You're free to agree with them, disagree with them, or ignore them. You do not have a right to file false abuse claims to manipulate Twitter into taking away their Twitter account.

&gt;They can call it whatever they want. But it's not legitimate.

"Therein lies one of the major fundamental arguments *against* cryptocurrencies that I've heard.

Basically, people wonder why you carry cash, because a bank is much more secure and convenient. When you tell people about a cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin for example, they wonder why you would use Bitcoin because using fiat and having a third party like a bank is a bit more convenient. Therefore, some company or entity will come around and try to bridge that gap between those people who just want simple banking, and Bitcoin. Those entities will try and make Bitcoin less esoteric and alleviate some of the barriers to entry for the average person. Then those entities basically become the giant third party intermediaries that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin were created to be against.

"I have an interesting story related to this:

Back when I was in college doing my last 2 years (2012-2014), I took finance class (basically finance 101) and some student asked about what the teacher about bitcoin. The teacher basically said it was 100% a scam. Bitcoin was like $20/each at the time. 

In another class (forensic accounting) another student actually gave a full 30 minute presentation to the class about what bitcoin was and how it worked. The teacher basically allowed students to give presentations for extra credit so this student gave a presentation on bitcoin. The presentation was basically a huge rave for how bitcoin is so great. When the student asked if anyone here owns any bitcoin I was like the only one who said yes. Ironically enough, the teacher said the technology sounded really interesting due to its impact on money laundering and financial crime lol.

Also ironically enough like 2 months ago an old friend from college messaged me on facebook and said ""hey, I remember you talking about bitcoin back when we were in college. I just learned about it and saw the price. How much have you made off this stuff??? I need to know."" and I was like ""enough"". lol, made my day. Good times.",1523255463

"&gt;""Since Bitcoin launched, there have been two groups of supporters""

This is incorrect. The division between big blockers and small blockers really only emerged around 2014 and became super prominent in late 2015 through censorship and social media manipulation efforts.

Transaction fees on the BTC chain are only down because so is usage, not because anything was fixed on the BTC chain. If/when more people start using BTC again, the transaction fee &amp; mempool problem will rear its ugly head again. 

I don't think two million merchants *can* accept Bitcoin payments. Jeff Garzik was talking about this a couple of years ago in what he dubbed [The Fidelity Problem](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3kytd0/jeff_garzik_on_the_fidelity_problem_fidelity/). Basically, even if a large company like Fidelity wanted to use Bitcoin, they wouldn't be able to due to the low block size limit on the BTC chain. 

Currently, the BTC chain can only process around 400k transactions per day at maximum. Even if *no one else* used the BTC chain, having 2 million merchants accept Bitcoin would mean that each merchant could accept only one BTC transaction every five days before completely maxing out the capacity of the network. Of course, this is unrealistic, because after the merchant receives a transaction, they probably need to make another transaction to move the coins where they need to go, and how are the customers paying with BTC acquiring it if not by creating even more transactions?

The Lightning Network isn't a silver bullet that will solve these issues. LN has some serious drawbacks, like the fact that all users need to either be online 24/7 or hire multiple paid ""watchtower"" services to avoid having your funds stolen. You need to hire multiple watchtowers for redundancy, because if you rely on just one watchtower and that service goes offline for whatever reason, then your funds can still be stolen. 

There's also the problem that with LN you can only receive payments up to the amount of money that you've already locked up inside a channel. If I'm a Lamborghini dealership and I want to sell a single Lambo, that means I need to have lambo money locked up inside my channel, just waiting for someone to come along and maybe buy a car from me. This just isn't tenable for a business. (A lambo is an extreme example, but the same concept applies for all businesses wanting to accept payment with LN)

This is why the BCH/BTC fissure exists, and why having enough on-chain capacity to handle demand is so important. ",1523253999

Do we need platform currencies? Why is building smart contract on a blockchain necessary? If it's not even decentralized as most are run by a single group or personalities, it runs the risk of regulation and it's just like any other company out there. Why do you need the tokens if it serves no purpose? Like ETH for example, it serves as a smart contract coin but all people use it for is price speculation. It has no other purpose other than price speculation for most people and it's not secure as Bitcoin.

I think only a couple of cryptos will survive into the future. No one knows but it's good to think critically in this space as so many are hyped but only a few will survive in long term.",1523253621

"I feel this is quite true. Easy usage is very important. And I guess we all can be honest to accept that cryptocurrencies currently aren't exactly easy to use. First you have to find a way to buy crypto, then a way to store it properly, then figure out how to pay and how to accept coins and so on. 

I hope it'll get easier in the future to use cryptocurrencies. That there will be UI's that makes them very easy to use and very easy to manage. 

Because every day I have to think about how awesome it would be, to have a widespread accepted cryptocurrency you can pay with (for example). Just recently I've been on vacation. All the things you have to care about, taking cash with you to change, which credit card to use (which is accepted, which has the lowest fees ect), where will you be able to trade money and so on. Having a widespread used cryptocurrency for payment would solve all those issue. No matter what country you're in, no matter which shop, where you are... you are (should be) able to pay with a cryptocurrency with low or no fees at all. (That would be a dream!). And actually should be possible, right? It just has to become easier to use!

"I personally have no issues with ""real anti-bch"" people posting on this sub, I actually think it's important. One of the biggest issues with r/bitcoin is that it's an echo chamber that doesn't allow debate on certain subjects. I'm interested in both btc and bch and ideally I want a place where all discussion is allowed about all the controversies in bitcoin and it's derivatives. Sure this is a very, very bias community, but it's easy enough to find comments against the grain, and some are very useful. I just often sort by controversial here. Considering there's no alternative it's not too bad.

What I do have an issue with, though, is your statement on calling downvoting censorship. It makes 0 sense. How an entire community can believe and echo something as silly and foolish as that is beyond me. And it just points to your own bias. WTF do you expect people to do? Upvote things they don't agree with? Surely you can't be that silly. But I guess it's a convenient way of attempting to take away the one moral advantage this thread has over r/bitcoin.",1523253107
"Accepting bitcoin isn’t the issue, there’s ways to do it. But how does a merchant integrate that sale, incl. the payment, the inventory, accounts, and many other aspects linked to an individual sale? 

This attitude of shouting down 3rd party systems is pushed throughout bitcoin related subreddits, and each one is almost completely uneducated to what being a ‘merchant’ means.

It’s not just selling a product and accepting a payment. A good POS system integrates that sale for merchants - inventory adjustments, reporting, accounting, and usually an eCommerce platform. 

Expecting merchants to perform external adjustments to pre-exisiting systems is naive. It takes the technological advancement in merchant systems backwards.

Any payment method, regardless of what it is, needs to exist within a POS for a merchant to use it efficiently.

Not all merchants are Amazon level equipped with developers, and their own custom built systems (which technically makes a merchant its own 3rd party anyway?) - most merchants are small, and use existing systems to manage business, Square is one, there’s many others.

Yes privacy and peer to peer are important factors to what makes bitcoin - but it’s detrimental to its development to put road blocks in place with blanket ideology if it makes no sense when you understand or recognise the specifics of merchant adoption.",1523253096
"As far as the DAA is concerned, yes, but as far as the miner is concerned, the hashpower is still being consumed and wasted! The effective difficulty of selfish mining is higher than the actual difficulty (which is why the DAA would adjust downward, and this effective difficulty penalizes honest miners more). All those orphaned blocks represent wasted hashpower, because every one is a perfectly valid block that didn't get confirmed on account of using the selfish mining strategy. If you compare apples-to-apples, over time, you will see that the DAA (either BTC or BCH) will not adjust enough to yield more blocks than what *would have been honestly mined with the same proportion of hashpower*. The number of blocks confirmed by selfish mining never exceeds the number of blocks that potentially would have been mined honestly with the same share of the network. The waste always exceeds the gain.",1523253024

"This is an implementation specific detail. Most merchants appear to be using bitpay, so let's look at bitpays specific implementation.

When you choose to pay with bitcoin, bitpay will make a payment protocol compatible payment request, which you scan with your wallet. If your wallet do not understand the payment protocol, you will get an error message. If your wallet does understand the payment protocol, you will be given the option to send funds only from funds associated with the appropiate network. Once done, your wallet will send a signed transaction to bitpay over the payment protocol for inspection, and they will validate and confirm that the signed transaction is sufficient to resolve the payment. If it isn't, they would reject it and your wallet would give you an error. If it is, they accept it, and you and/or bitpay broadcast the transaction to the network and the merchant is informed about the transaction.

There is 0% chance of paying from the wrong chain when a merchant uses bitpay. This is coincidentally also one of the main selling points for merchants: stuff works.

If the do not use bitpay and the payment protocol, it depends on whatever implementation is used; but if the implementation uses the CashAddr address format, then you would have to have a really stupid wallet in order to send the wrong type of funds.

If the merchant is using the old legacy address format however, and there is no prevalidation of the transaction before broadcast, then the merchant would probably just look at you and get a bit impatient as his blockchain monitoring solution wouldn't register the transaction and since he cannot prove he has gotten paid you will likely be out the goods or services you desired.

If it is a very friendly merchant and you can sit around and talk and try to resolve the issue without disturbing the business, there might be some room to resolve a mispayment like this, but I wouldn't gamble on it.",1523252806

Inside the Dragon's Den: Bitcoin Core's Troll Army
April 06, 2017
Yesterday, Lightning Network developer Joseph Poon wrote in a Reddit comment:

They just have a secret channel where they organize their PR and trolling campaigns. Many people have talked about it (more than 5 people) and it's alluded to in various places which are publicly accessible, since it's basically where a lot of decisions around PR happens.

I'm extremely upset that they are attacking me for going to the press when they participate in far more underhanded tactics, and all of Core knows full well what they're doing if not actively contributing.
I believe what Poon was referring to is a private channel in the Bitcoin Core Slack called #dragonsden. This channel's existence was publicly revealed during a talk given by Bram Cohen. During Cohen's talk, a notification minimized his slides, and he had the Bitcoin Core Slack open to the #dragonsden channel.

You can see this happen at 14:26 in the video of his talk.

The above transcription is provided only for the sake of convenience, and does not prove anything itself. Here's what is known:

Poon alluded to ""a secret channel where they organize their PR and trolling campaigns"" which is ""basically where a lot of decisions around PR happens.""
There is a secret channel on the Bitcoin Core slack called #dragonsden
There are 21 members in this chat group, as of January 27th, 2017 (the date of Cohen's talk)
The known members of this channel, based on the information in the above glimpse of the channel are: BashCo (/r/bitcoin moderator), mrhodl (twitter troll), alp (twitter troll), moli (unknown), belcher (JoinMarket developer), BtcDrak (Bitcoin Core developer/activist) and Bram Cohen. These seven members represent 1/3rd of the total members in the channel. 
BashCo is Theymos's second in command. Fellow /r/bitcoin moderator ThePiachu wrote in a blog post:
A few more perceptive readers might notice something has changed in the mod team on /r/Bitcoin - I'm claiming to have been moderating for four years, but the page only accounts for seven months. This mod reshuffle has been due to the alleged discussion between Coinbase and Reddit CEOs about removal of Theymos from the /r/Bitcoin mod team. Our top mod reshuffled the mod team to ensure BashCo would be the first in line in case he gets removed, as unfortunately Reddit has some issues when it comes to managing moderators. While not an ideal situation from my perspective obviously, I could get behind BashCo being the top moderator if worse came to worse.
6. This establishes proof that there is collusion between Bitcoin Core and the moderation team of /r/Bitcoin.

7. At least one Bitcoin Core developer is present in this chat. There are 14 more chat members we cannot see.



This information provides further evidence of the Bitcoin Core propaganda machine and demonstrates the conclusive link between Bitcoin Core and the /r/Bitcoin moderation team. Everything written above is factual and verifiable.

"Maybe. [This was discussed in 2014 by Ittay and Emin](http://hackingdistributed.com/2014/01/15/detecting-selfish-mining/):

&gt;Number of abandoned (orphaned) blocks is a strong indicator of selfish mining activity. The entire idea behind selfish mining is for the selfish pool to outcompete the work of the honest pool. And this will leave behind a series of discarded blocks, where either the honest guy's work was wasted, or the miner took a slight risk and failed. Since every block race will leave such detritus behind in its wake, one could just count the number of such abandoned blocks to see if the rate is stable over time. A rise in the rate would indicate that a selfish mining pool is operating in the network.

&gt;The problem with this approach is that abandoned blocks are pruned inside the Bitcoin network, so it is very difficult to get a definitive count. A measurement tool that connects to the network from just one or a few vantage points may very well miss abandoned blocks, and it may erroneously give the impression that everything is fine when there are fierce battles being fought out inside the network. I am not sure how well blockchain.info is connected, but no web service can be everywhere at once to detect every single orphan, so I take its count of orphans with a large grain of salt.

A miner that implemented it would be seen as a threat, not a competitor. For any threat to be successful within bitcoin, it must go undetected - hence, arbitrary RBF is not the smartest way to invest your mining power.

Sure, it might work, but that just announces to everyone that your pool is willing to assist with fraud. Mining RBF only announces exploitation to the network - one fee, everlasting consequences.

"&gt;""Since Bitcoin launched, there have been two groups of supporters""

This is incorrect. The division between big blockers and small blockers really only emerged around 2014 and became super prominent in late 2015 through censorship and social media manipulation efforts.

Transaction fees on the BTC chain are only down because so is usage, not because anything was fixed on the BTC chain. If/when more people start using BTC again, the transaction fee &amp; mempool problem will rear its ugly head again. 

I don't think two million merchants *can* accept Bitcoin payments. Jeff Garzik was talking about this a couple of years ago in what he dubbed [The Fidelity Problem](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3kytd0/jeff_garzik_on_the_fidelity_problem_fidelity/). Basically, even if a large company like Fidelity wanted to use Bitcoin, they wouldn't be able to due to the low block size limit on the BTC chain. 

Currently, the BTC chain can only process around 400k transactions per day at maximum. Even if *no one else* used the BTC chain, having 2 million merchants accept Bitcoin would mean that each merchant could accept only one BTC transaction every five days before completely maxing out the capacity of the network. Of course, this is unrealistic, because after the merchant receives a transaction, they probably need to make another transaction to move the coins where they need to go, and how are the customers paying with BTC acquiring it if not by creating even more transactions?

The Lightning Network isn't a silver bullet that will solve these issues. LN has some serious drawbacks, like the fact that all users need to either be online 24/7 or hire multiple paid ""watchtower"" services to avoid having your funds stolen. You need to hire multiple watchtowers for redundancy, because if you rely on just one watchtower and that service goes offline for whatever reason, then your funds can still be stolen. 

There's also the problem that with LN you can only receive payments up to the amount of money that you've already locked up inside a channel. If I'm a Lamborghini dealership and I want to sell a single Lambo, that means I need to have lambo money locked up inside my channel, just waiting for someone to come along and maybe buy a car from me. This just isn't tenable for a business. (A lambo is an extreme example, but the same concept applies for all businesses wanting to accept payment with LN)

This is why the BCH/BTC fissure exists, and why having enough on-chain capacity to handle demand is so important. ",1523248098

"We do not favor BCH instead of Bitcoin. BCH is Bitcoin. That is why.  Bitcoin Core (BTC) is an altcoin. Before you rage ask yourself, ""what defines Bitcoin?"". By any set of objective criteria BCH is as much ""Bitcoin"" as BTC. Once you understand this then you can ask ""Which is more like Bitcoin? BTC or BCH?"" The choice is clear then. 

To understand this you simply need to understand how forks work. You also need to know that the current BCH and BTC chains of Bitcoin are both forks of an earlier version of Bitcoin. 

The BTC chain forked to add SegWit and replace-by-fee (which allows double spending. 

The BCH chain was created to remove RBF and preserve Bitcoin for on-chain scaling. BCH makes lightning fast, ""0-confirmation"" transactions possible. Once the transaction is broadcast to the network (about 3-5 seconds after you hit send in your wallet) the money is safe from double-spend and can be accepted by merchants with full confidence. (though full confirmation takes an avg of 10 mins)",1523246798

* Tried and tested scaling thru block size increases instead of introducing an overly complex second layer solutions which has some serious [drawbacks](https://medium.com/@jonaldfyookball/mathematical-proof-that-the-lightning-network-cannot-be-a-decentralized-bitcoin-scaling-solution-1b8147650800) (always need to be online, tying up funds in channels, need to run your own lightning node, etc).

* A commitment to fast and extremely cheap transactions - suitable for third world countries in dire need of an alternative currency due to inflation. The next boom in crypto is going to come from countries like Venezuela and Greece. The BCH roadmap is much more conducive for [serving these populations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjyZ1SjNz9g). 

* [Colored coins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=889JSfIaPzs) similar to what makes Ethereum unique is coming out this year. Core developers removed this feature from their road map years ago.

Not to mention many merchant services like OpenBazaar and Bitpay who are integrating BCH because BTC doesn't cut it anymore.

"Please know all this about lightning before getting too excited 

Essentially, lightning only works as a scaling solution when everyone is already using it. It has no way to bridge the gap from no users(where it is starting) to everyone worldwide using it.

Worse, it has numerous tradeoffs that will discourage the average person from using it. This amplifies the downsides that arise from it not being universally in use instantly, and will prevent it from ever reaching that state. Here are those:

1. You must be online all the time to be paid. And the person you want to pay must be online for you to pay them.

2. If you go offline at the wrong time and aren't using a centralized hub, you can lose money you didn't even knowingly transact with.

3. The solution to #2 is to enlist ""watchers"" to prevent you from losing money. More overhead the average person isn't going to care about or understand, and more fees that have to be paid. Or people will just be forced to use centralized hubs.

4. Two new users to Lightning will not be able to actually pay eachother without using a centralized hub because no one will lock up funds into the opposing side of their channels; No funded channels = can't pay eachother. Hence... Hubs.

5. Using hubs will come with monthly fee; They aren't going to lock up their capital on your behalf for no cost.

6. The entire system is vulnerable to a mass-default attack. Hubs are especially vulnerable.

7. Lightning will not be able to route large payments(no route available).

8. Lightning transactions are larger than normal transactions.

9. Lightning nodes must keep track of the full history of channel states themselves. If they lose this, they are vulnerable to attacks and may lose coins.

10. Attackers may randomly lock up funds anywhere along the chain of channels for extended periods of time(many hours) at no cost to themselves.

11. The network randomly may fail to work for a user under certain circumstances for no discernable reason as far as they can see (no route available). 


And the issues directly related to the not having everyone on the planet on lightning at first:

1. Small payments consolidating into larger ones, such as a retailer who needs to pay vendors, will fail to route on Lightning, and the loop between the source of the payments(end users) and their destinations(retailers) is broken. This means every channel will ""flow"" in one direction, and need to be refilled to resume actually being used.

2. Refilling every channel will be at least one onchain transaction, possibly two. If this happens twice a month, 1mb blocks + segwit will only be able to serve 4 million users. Some estimates are that Bitcoin already has 2-3 million users.

3. Regardless of lightning's offchain use, Bitcoin must still have enough transaction fees to provide for its network security. Except instead of that minimum fee level being shouldered by 1000 - 500000 million transactions, it is only shouldered by ~170 million transactions with segwit 1mb blocks.
That situation doesn't exist in a vacuum. Users will have a choice - They can go through all that, deal with all of those limitations, odd failures &amp; risks and pay the incredibly high fees for getting on lightning in the first place... Or they can just buy Ethereum, use a SPV wallet, and have payments confirmed in 15 seconds for a fraction of the fees. Or roughly the same choice for SPV+BCH.

The choice will be obvious.

My (and many others) opinion is that lighting is not near as good as people think it will be... It just isn't a scaling solution. Lightning is fine for use cases that need to do frequent, small, or predictable payments with few entities. For example, mining pools paying PPLNS miners. Or gamblers making small bets on gambling sites. Or traders making frequent trades on exchanges.

But as a general purpose scaling solution for average people? It sucks, and they are absolutely not going to go through all of that shit just to use crypto, especially not with better, cheaper, more reliable options out there.",1523246650

"Notice that the comment there includes ""pretty much said"", rather than ""said""? Is English not your first language or something?

If I claimed that in [your comment above](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/89bigx/please_clap/dwqdo6w/), you pretty much said ""His comment is legible, and both your accusations against Vitalik being a money grabber and your reference to what Satoshi wrote are both misleading"" it does not represent me trying to argue that those were the literal words you wrote (otherwise, I wouldn't use the phrase ""pretty much"" at all, and would have just copy-and-pasted the comment verbatim).

1) You said (and I quote verbatim): ""despite your accusations of vitalik being a money grabber""; I did not do this. This is a strawman argument.

2) You said (and I quote verbatim): ""you shouldn't use an assumption of what satoshi said as a literal quote""; I did not do this. This is a strawman argument.

"""Bcash"" is an ERC20 token related to gambling. Maybe you are referring to Bitcoin (BCH) also known as Bitcoin Cash? You betray your unobjective, resentful bias by using slurs to describe Bitcoin. 

Some facts:
-BCH was a fork created to preserve the intention and roadmap of Bitcoin to scale on-chain and compete with traditional payment systems. 
-BTC is a fork of the original Bitcoin chain and adds replace-by-fee and SegWit. The roadmap of this version includes proprietary side-chains and second layers aka science experiments. 
-BCH adoption is increasing
-BTC adoption has fallen off a cliff. Transactions per day have plummeted
(bitinfocharts.com has the data)
-Bitcoin Cash is supported by all the vast majority of exchanges
-Bitcoin Cash is accepted at hundreds of thousands of merchants on and offline thanks to BitPay and other processors. 
-Bitcoin Cash fees are nearly free and transactions are lightning fast.

I asked my accountant in the UK about my losses and he just laughed. He like most does not understand it. I see it as a pension alternative but the government won't, happy to tax any profits though. 

I would have to pay full capital gains on any profit but only once crystallized back to GBP. If I leave it in hodl it's not going to be taxed here.
Paying for services with BTC (or others) completely bypasses this economy's tax system and I expect that's more the case worldwide.  If mass adoption occurred then I expect the UK might go the way of the US but the GBP is not quite the corporate private owned currency that the USD is. Global banking interests are under threat so corporate defense is strong, most notable in the most invested countries e.g. The US

Its for the people to defend the losses aspect of this now, governments race to tax proceeds but I've seen little talk of losses side.

I have no plans to remove my investment and would happily pay my capital gains if I made it big (Hardly likely for this small fish).

"&gt; Market cap is not ""bunk"".

Yes, it is.

&gt;Your example is silly. 

Yes, that's the point. It demonstrates how silly the ""market cap"" figure is, and why it shouldn't be taken seriously at all.

&gt;The only way to game the market cap is to game the price so essentially what you're saying is that price is a meaningless metric.

Nope, not at all. [It has been abused in various ways](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/7fkhbe/daily_discussion_sunday_november_26_2017/dqcy0sq/), because there are [very easy](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/7fkhbe/daily_discussion_sunday_november_26_2017/dqd0ciu/) ways to game the metric, and because it is a nice, singular, quantifiable number that many people (naively) take seriously, there are serious incentives to actually do so. Over time, a number of [surprisingly effective techniques](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7fezvo/bitcoin_should_be_referred_to_as_smart_money/dqbhtbw/) have arisen, all natural responses to this set of incentives.

You clearly haven't spent much time thinking about this.

&gt;And in the scenario you've made up it's still not ""bunk"" because it's just a metric.

It's just as bunk as ""measuring the sizes of physical coins to guess what their values are""; quarters are bigger than pennies and nickels, but **oops**, dimes ruin the whole thing. You could say ""in this scenario, it's still not 'bunk' because it's just a metric"" but you'd be just as wrong: it's a metric, *and* it's definitely bunk.

&gt;If someone wants to sell your shitcoin for 1$ the market cap would actually be a great metric to have because it may not be obvious to the buyer that the coin is not worth 1$ but it's damn sure obvious that it doesn't deserve a $100 trillion dollar market cap. 

That's *not* obvious, because the market cap figure is essentially meaningless due to how gameable it is. You're trying to have the cake and eat it, too; if you argue that the metric is not gameable, then this hypothetical buyer should trust the fact that the coin earned a $100 trillion market cap... if they are able to ""obviously see"" that the coin doesn't deserve that market cap, you just admitted that the metric is completely gameable.

Shorting works by borrowing fungible assets, selling it ..... sitting on your hands ..... and then buying and identical asset back at a lower price, and giving it back to the person you borrowed it from. You just keep the difference in price.

Personally, I believe currencies like Bitcoin, Etherium and Neo are only in their infancies and still have alot to offer. I also believe that blockchain technology is a worthwhile investment. Combined, these entities are the only competitors that challenge Fiat curency which I believe is very important. Will they ever supercede Fiat and our dependance on the banks? Extremely unlikely as there is so much work to be done in the cryptocurrency world. 

For the present, I believe that the major currencies will increase in value and will still be relevant for the forseable future as there is so much money and potential invested in these endeavors. The whole market may end up crashing and burning due to the obvious inadequcies, but with all the research I have done it is not likely in the short term.

4) It has a dedicated censorship free community that has been able to endure one of the most lengthy and well funded social media troll campaigns in crypto history. 

5) Graphene and Gavin Andreson (it's creator) working on the implementation

6) 0-conf: Which has been publically tested successfully by a plethora of users for months now, and multiple exchanges are implementing it. 

7) Multiple independent development teams (ABC, Unlimited, nChain, Parity, etc) instead of one (Blockstream/Core)

The few people I know who do buy into crypto are just in it to make it rich, no appreciation for tech, or the underlying concept of decentralisation. Which is why I feel his argument on distrusting banks isn't as strong as we'd hope it be.

I do however think that the people who are in it purely for wealth are our ticket to reigniting a bull marketing. We just need some sort of catalyst to trigger major fomo. More people know about Bitcoin than before, but none of them are gonna buy in on a downtrend.

And investment houses have jobs, employees and the very real need to turn profits or else they shut up shop. When the global market collapses, and it is going to collapse you can't have ten years of central banks buying everything and sustain it indefinitely, all that money will need to go somewhere else to keep playing the trading game. And the only place for them to go will be crypto. Those firms, who arguably run the world (before you scream conspiracy at me do your research, Citibank picked Obama's entire cabinet during his first term), aren't going to pack it up and go home after a long economic crash, they are going to find the next game and keep playing. Is this unrealistic? Maybe. But ask yourself why in the last few months, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, and now Soros and Rockefeller backed firms are officially announcing getting into crypto.

"More importantly: paying off your debt is 100% guaranteed to bring up your net worth(because you have no negatives working against you on it) whereas Bitcoin only might work out for you. It's even less likely to work out the more you watch the price and panic sell.

I'd say it really depends on whether you believe your interest in the long run will be worth more paying down the debt or investing. For even the lowest interest possible on credit cards you would need to consistently be an incredible investor before you could safely say it was a waste to pay down your credit card, whereas you'd need to be consistently bad to make paying extra on your 3-4% APR mortgage the cheaper choice in the long run. Though there's a good argument to be made for the peace of mind that comes with doing so.

So long as you are at least up to date on all payments, investing is a personal choice, but any high-interest debt should be handled first. Beyond the high interest debt, any decisions to invest in stocks or crypto is a matter of choice so long as you stay current on your low interest debts",1523236906

"Coinbase is reliable and backed. They have a ton of customers, so there are obviously some horror stories. That said, most people have 0 issues. I've never had much of a problem at all. Keep in mind bank account transactions will take some time to process.

Other ones I trust in order:
Binance
Kucoin
Bittrex
Huobi
Idex (not beginner friendly but pretty secure)
Bibox is decent

For investing. Stick with big ones like bitcoin/ethereum/neo/stellar/monero before going onto other things. It's good to learn the ropes of what is really scummy looking, reading a bit on whitepapers, and getting an idea what the whole goal of a coin is.

That said, take every coin suggestion with a grain of salt. I don't own all those that I suggested, but you'll find that people will invest in something they have no clue about, and immediately reccommend it to anybody with ears.  Take every recommendation with a fistful of salt. 

Tips: 

Keep in mind transfer fees. Coinbase is pretty low for their stuff, (few cents for eth and ltc last I used) and tells you the dollar amount. Other sites might charge like 20 of that currency to transfer, and each one is worth $1+.

When transfering coins, the type matters.. I remember buying bitcoin in last November and sent it out. 18 hours later it got there. Bitcoin isn't nearly as congested, but litecoin/eth/Bch generally just take a few minutes.

Don't assume you can beat the other traders by selling then buying again. Magically what usually happens is you sell, and the price rockets up. Don't keep trying this and losing money.

hi, a family member of mine has $1000 worth of CTR coin (no idea why he bought it) tied up on binance right now. they are allowing withdrawals for the next month. but we have no idea where to withdraw it to. and binance isnt allowing trading it into another cryto.

so my question is where can i make an account with a quick/instant verification process that i can withdraw the CTR coin to and trade it into another coin preferably BTC, ETH, LTC. BCH (something on coinbase). ??. or am i screwed out of $1000",1523236594

The trading volume is going down every day, it is now under 4BN daily for BTC.

4k seems fair price based on sentiment and the lack of interest in trading.

"&gt; How hard it is to understand?

Seems like a giant leap (apparently) that one chain and non-proprietary [open-source implementation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model) could possibly be much closer to the technical definition of the Bitcoin protocol... than the other.

Which chain and implementation sticks most to the technical description of Bitcoin as described in the [whitepaper](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/whitepaper)?

Or perhaps force the creation of two independent implementations. Or at least, get rid of the whole ""official repo"" or official anything for that matter. He did none. Many people got worried as soon as it became clear that the future of bitcoin would be dictacted by steering a bunch of established entities rather than the market organically picking from available alternative implementations.

You say I'm mischaracterizing BCH users? They literally named the Bitcoin Cash conference ""Satoshis vision"". People call Roger Ver ""Bitcoin Jesus"". When pressed about Bitcoin, BCH users quote Satoshi's ""Bitcoin is a P2P electronic cash system"" as if that is proof of one fork over another, not unlike a commandment. BCH/BTC debates often end up with the BCH side quoting Satoshi forum posts like a minister quotes bible verse. Again, not picking sides, but this what that camp looks like when you take a step back. Plenty of reason not to support a layer 2 solution, but quoting a dead founder as if he could predict the future is a bit too much like 'faith' for my tastes.",1523235924

"Actually, I do understand them, but I’m arguing against Bitcoin advocates so it’s not like you guys understand markets very well. I traded oil futures, taking a short position, and profited in March 2017... 

And that’s not the point I was getting at nor related to what I said, so you didn’t prove anything here. Contracts for cash settled futures do not affect the spot price of the underlying assets, but do influence spot prices for physical delivery. There is empirical evidence to support both of these. An ETF on Bitcoin would has no effect on the spot price of Bitcoin because ETFs have share issuance provisions built in preventing market prices from straying too far from NAV. If the underlying benchmark is cash settled Bitcoin futures, then there is no affect on the Bitcoin spot from the ETF. 

Yes you are correct that arbitrage trade between futures and ETFs has nothing to do with cash settlement or physical delivery. But an ETF with underlying futures as the benchmark that is cash settled would have no effect on the spot prices of the underlying asset. For example, prices for cash settled S&amp;P 500 futures do not affect prices the S&amp;P 500 index. S&amp;P 500 futures prices are influenced by the underlying index, but can stray from the underlying index as speculators bet on whether their settlement price will be above or below the underlying index. The same could be said for VIX futures, which do not effect the underlying VIX index. ",1523235865

Lol.. Coinbase text signaling?? That's laughable. That has nothing to do with the Bitcoin protocol. Here's a fact for you: Segwit didn't break existing consensus.

Either blocks are valid, or they're invalid.

"I agree that it's a brand, the real issue in question is who is the owner. In my mind, it's just an internet free-for-all and that's what it's got to be in this decentralized world. There's (rightfully) no foundation or official leadership organization that can claim ownership, so there's really no legitimacy, IMHO, to disputing the usage of the name as a scam because you disagree with the account owner's interpretation of what bitcoin is.

One group (or individual) owns bitcoin.com, another bitcoin.org, another @bitcoin, and another owns the github repo. These people or groups don't all agree on what is or isn't bitcoin, and thats _fine_. That's part of the beauty (and sometimes curse) of a decentralized network.

Personally I agree with the idea that we shouldn't confuse people and try to call bitcoin cash bitcoin. (at least) two groups disagreed about the direction the coin should go, and both created changes to it to suit their needs. One of these groups is larger and owns the github repo, so I think it's fine that they get to keep the name ""bitcoin"", but that doesn't give them the right to refuse anyone else use it. In order to reduce confusion, someone came up with the idea to add ""cash"" to the end of one of the versions to emphasize it's purpose and ideology. I honestly don't think either ideology is more right than the other, and I think it's counterproductive to try to argue what Satoshi would do in a world that he didn't and couldn't predict (tons of altcoins, corporate interest, speculative trading, etc). It's like arguing who Tupac's favorite modern rapper would be.",1523234426

&gt;Tell me, good sir, why were the majority of votes in August 2015 in favor of a blocksize increase

Votes?  Votes don't determine the protocol. Maybe you should re-read the whitepaper.  Coinbase text signaling is not part of the Bitcoin protocol. Bitcoin is not a democracy, it's a consensus network. As a miner, you can choose to make valid blocks, that adhere to the protocol rules, or you can make invalid blocks, and fork yourself onto a minority chain. ""Voting"" is meaningless.

"&gt; Why BCH fans favour BCH instead of Bitcoin. 

I would say mainly because we believe Bitcoin lost it's purpose.

Bitcoin was meant to be USED, not held. Buying dinners and shouting your mates at the bar. Instead it's used by a select few to HODL and to the moon. 

**BCH has use because you can buy and spend with it and not have to worry about high tx fees due to it not having RBF; but blocks that are large enough to accommodate them.** 

While Bitcoin's fees have dropped dramatically after Dec, they will still be an issue as soon as the price rises. 

Bitcoin has the benefit of being a household name now and this is wherein the problem lies. Ill informed people know nothing about the politics, buy in with a hope for investment and have no intentions of spending the investment. 

Usefulness carries value. If it's no longer useful how can it be worth something? This is why the value holds on BCH. Because people USE it.",1523234114

&gt;Like I said, Bitcoin Core doesn't have a right to monopolize the Bitcoin name.

And like I said, no development team chooses that name. The name is of the consensus network. There is only one Bitcoin, and it is determined by the free market. Trying to pass off you cheap imitation at the real thing, is fraud. 

&gt;The Bitcoin Cash team can legitimately call their network Bitcoin, for reasons I've already outlined.

They can call it whatever they want. But it's not legitimate. It's a scam, and the market reflects that. 


&gt;It's about a change in the roadmap needing consensus, which the Bitcoin Core squad never got when they decided to change the roadmap to scale off-chain instead of on-chain.

"goodness gracious, how desperate are people to hype Bitcoin (cryptos in general) back up?   
It barely got past 7K but they say ""holding steady""?    

The simple fact is... whether you like to hear it or not, cryptos are currently way over valued.   
The only reason they got up high near end of last year was based on hype.  Delusional sentiment has eased, basically the buyers (suckers) pool has dried up. The whales have dumped most of their holdings, they did not get to dump all of it yet because prices dropped too fast for them.   
That is the only reason prices are still at these levels.   
Standing price for BTC should be about 4k.   
To get BTC back to the same ATH it will required much more capital than it took to get there in the first place. This applies even more for all other coins and tokens, because now there are that many more coins/tokens in circulation.    
Furthermore previously people were jumping from one coin to another to build up their total porfolio's worth.    
However since the market is so down, no one is going to move everyone is hodling. Which means all the coins need a lot more new capital coming in, and it is not going to come in.

"Satoshi said that if you leave and then come back later, you can likely rely on the longest chain as the valid chain. He didn't say it was the be-all end all. Longest chain as the *only* qualifier is very naive.

If all miners decided tomorrow to burn all current available UTXOs, increase the supply to 106 million coins, and only allow miner-to-exchange transactions... according to your logic, that's now bitcoin? I mean, it was a consensus so it must be bitcoin since it's the longest chain. Point is, longest chain is *most likely* bitcoin, since most miners will *most likely* be honest. It's about the probability that the network has not been circumvented by a majority of miners.",1523231347
"&gt;The first rumors began surfacing back in 2017 when Rothschild began purchasing cryptocurrency through GBTC. Buying into a major Bitcoin Trust is pretty significant, even for this family’s legacy.

&gt; This is false hype; It is actually pretty ridiculous that people are falling for this.

"I’m 100% in agreement, that’s why I’m a supporter and have remained aligned with BCH since the fork. Every point you make is FTW, and maybe I just get sick of avoiding price talks in the community acting as though they don’t matter. I don’t have the answers, I guess time and patience are necessary. It’s hard not to feel frustrated watching a superior coin bleed out after so much hype and run up. The momentum feels drained, and the two biggest mouthpieces in the public are polarizing at best. It’s a tough spot for BCH to be in. 

To answer your last question... yes, I do actually think blockstream, DCG, ETH can all compete and potentially ruin BCH. I certainly hope they don’t, but I definitely think they have plenty of power in the crypto market. Hardly anyone in the world really knows what bitcoin truly is or how it works. To suggest that misinformed people will take the time to do due diligence beyond profiteering in this speculative space is narrow sighted. For now the almighty dollar still rules all and crypto is a dreamy experiment. If the price action isn’t there, then people will go to where it is, just like if it costs to much to use (high fees and slow service), people will go to a cheaper and efficient solution. Therefore, if BTC/LN or ETH/POS are able to scale before facing further latency and user cost issues, then BCH could be rendered useless even if superior fundamentally and socio-politically. This is why I am frustrated that BCH hasn’t been able to hold its ground in BTC pairing. We’ve been slaughtered. Some was to be expected, but it’s bad and in dire need of some sort of positive run up soon.",1523231202

"Soros was able to build a massive position on the pound because it was easy to acquire quietly and anonymously.

Obtaining enough bitcoin to massively corner the market is all but impossible.  He would have to acquire several million over the counter, or somehow without the market figuring it out (impossible).

Bitcoin whale wallets are known, there owners are sometimes a mystery, but large sums of bitcoin rarely move without someone knowing about it.  The same cannot be said about the pound or any other currency Soros might have shorted in the past. 

Can he do it? Sure.  He'd have to acquire and maintain hundred of small wallets over the course of a few years, moving them in and out without drawing too much suspicion.  But so could any other person and the variables of bitcoin appreciation and depreciation are vastly different and wildly out of his control.

"How have I not answered your question? Identity thieves jobs are made easier when all they have to attack is a single point of failure. That point of failure is the central servers and databases of retailers and banks with all our info. Those servers/databases have every transaction and all the customer account info: information that customer gave them when they signed up for their credit and debit cards like social security, date of birth, license number, address. Enough information for hackers to sell to identify thieves. This is not hypothetical. This has happened and is happening. 

It’s easier to attack a central point of failure holding a lot of people’s info than to extract that same info from a blockchain where that info isn’t even required to be in there in the first place.

In the past 10 years of BTCs existence, how many millions had their ss, dob, license info been compromised? And I’m referring to merchants and actual transactions on the blockchain. Exchange hacks don’t count because BTC users shouldn’t even be using them since the point of crypto was to be peer to peer... not peer to exchange to peer. But even if we included exchange hacks, it still doesn’t compare with the ID theft going on with credit and debit cards. 

Your proposed alternative is to use visa gift cards. why should I have to physically leave my house to purchase a card with cash when I can just stay at home and use my BTC. Furthermore, how is someone in a third world country supposed to buy these gift cards to make purchases? Supposed I want to send money. For that I have to use western union and pay a fee. And I have to disclose my name and address. Sure I could maybe use a visa gift card or whatever western union accepts, but I still have to pay a fee and include my name and address. In some cases, ID is required. Well I don’t want to do that. And I don’t want to pay a fee. And my receiver has to physically travel to a western union location. 

BTC eliminates a lot of the hassle. I send BTC from my SegWit wallet to his SegWit wallet. Low fees. Peer to peer. He never has to leave his home. I know of stories of people in South America who have to travel to “safe” locations to pick up money bc there are criminals staking out these places, knowing there are people picking up money being sent by relatives in America. 

With BTC, it goes from my app to his app and he doesn’t have to tell anyone. 

So as a payment processor and a medium of sending money, it’s more efficient. And I don’t have to worry about a central point of failure holding my personal info.",1523230608

I had the same doubts as you, in part because of how dubious Craig is as a source. I think the case for this is actually pretty good.

The Bitcoin Core developers, after pushing out the lead developer Gavin Andresen and Core developer Jeff Garzik, have changed the roadmap from on-chain scaling, to off-chain scaling. There was never any community-wide consensus for this change in roadmaps.

So now that Bitcoin has forked into two (the original scaling roadmap vs the original code), the @bitcoin account, which a Bitcoin supporter has controlled since 2012, is supporting one of those versions of Bitcoin. 

The Bitcoin Core troll army has responded by making false reports of @Bitcoin account abuse to Twitter.  Keep in mind that no one owns the Bitcoin trademark, and anyone has a right to promote their own vision for Bitcoin.

all bitcoin has to do it just keep hard forking back to b4 the financial elite entered the picture...everytime they try to get back into bitcoin it gonna cost them a sh$tload!...but lets see how they play it,1523228368
"&gt;Why make their identity thieving jobs any easier?

How is it making it harder by uploading a permanent pseudonymous record of all your purchases? You have not once explained this, you've just said cash is more inconvenient if you want to buy online (even though its way more convenient to buy cards with cash than bitcoins) as if that somehow makes it less private than a public database, even though there's way more shit you can buy with an amazon gift card bought anonymously in cash than you can with bitcoins.

&gt;Again you’re assuming the only way i’d have $10k in bitcoin is if I bought it from an exchange. But as I mentioned, I can very well have accumulated it by earning it. Therefore there is still no sensitive private info involved.

You can accumulate $10,000 in cash if you want, that's not an argument for bitcoin. There's even less information involved in getting paid in cash.

&gt; How am I supposed to use paper fiat cash to make a big purchase online?

You can get a Amazon gift card up to $5,000. How often are you making online purchases higher than that? What would you even be buying, a car? Why would you want to buy something so expensive without ever seeing it first?

Are you saying the inconvenience of having to go to a physical store 1 time in 1000 is bigger than the inconvenience of 99% of stores not accepting bitcoin? 

&gt;Granted not everything I want can be bought with BTC right now given how small the number of merchants there are willing to accept BTC

You said you never have to use cash.
",1523228357
"&gt;No relevance? Those are potential future users. Much more important than the current userbase. And that's cause convincing them to use crypto is what will make crypto actually successful.

How do people who are not involved in Bitcoin have any influence on it? As soon as they get register on an exchange (and have a decently normal human brain) they will realize that there is BTC and BCH.

&gt;How about this one?

So what does this have to do with getting offended about the name Bcash? 

I don't really care about Roger Ver, but people like you who mostly spend their time on censored subreddits keep spamming the same few clips over and over again are just annoying. ",1523228351

"What this fails to take into account is that bigger blocks means more parasitic behavior on the chain. So modest increases get eaten up way faster by shit like counterparty  than what is actually adoption. 

But that’s a non sequitur. I just showed you proof that the core devs believe on chain scaling is likely, but that they clearly want to limit the contentious nature of doing block sized increases. The high fees were related to the parabolic rise in value and a massive increase in transactions. It also didn’t help that coinbase wasn’t batching transactions. We are now seeing a reasonable fee scenario, and major uptick in segwit adoption. I’m not really sure what the problem is exactly. 

The hysterical Roger Ver has made this whole debate unbelievable easy to align on the correct side of things. I read the stuff that the core devs have written and then I read roger Ver’s bullshit laden missives or Craig Wright’s nonsensical delusions and it is so clear who has the more honest and more technically sound view of bitcoin. You seem to be nitpicking that the devs couldn’t implement a blocksize increase during a price spike. That’s petty as fuck. I didn’t want a blocksize increase brought on by panicked corporations, I want it to be a no brained. Segwit achieved the modest blocksize increase you mentioned and it was a soft fork.

Too many people think that BCH created by Jihan and Ver to make money for themselves only. They are fed the idea that BCH is a project with no history in the old Bitcoin community.

Bitcoin wins.

2. You’re assuming there’s an employer I earned it from. If my desire is to be anonymous AND to never include sensitive info like ss, dob.... why would I earn BTC from an employer? I mean earning BTC as in getting it from freelance work, on the side work, odd jobs here and there. I do a favor for a friend... he pays me back in BTC to my spending wallet. Any ss, dob info involved? No. 

Bitcoin wins.

3. Again you’re assuming the only way i’d have $10k in bitcoin is if I bought it from an exchange. But as I mentioned, I can very well have accumulated it by earning it. Therefore there is still no sensitive private info involved. 

How am I supposed to use paper fiat cash to make a big purchase online? Let’s say there’s some electronic system, device, gadget, toy, I want from a seller in Europe. I don’t want to use my cc due to not wanting to expose my sensitive info. I can’t mail cash. And the seller doesn’t take post office money orders. What’s a quicker transaction without compromising my info? Oh yeah.... sending some BTC from my segwit wallet to his SegWit wallet. No sensitive info ever disclosed.

Bitcoin wins.

Granted not everything I want can be bought with BTC right now given how small the number of merchants there are willing to accept BTC, but they do exist. And this is still an early technology so I accept that reality. 

The reality I shouldn’t have to accept is that for the sake of efficiency, I should trust third parties to protect my info from data breaches. But oh wait........ every year, every month we’re hearing about data breaches from retailers to banks. I was a victim of the Target data breach. My info was out there. 

Had I used BTC, my ss, dob, and license info would never be out there. And I’m not going to take the banks’ word for it when they say “only a limited amount of info was compromised”. If just my ss was among the data breach, I have to assume everything was compromised. I don’t have those worries with BTC. I don’t keep my BTC on an exchange. It goes straight to a cold wallet. My BTC from an exchange never meets my spending BTC wallet. It would take a hacker more effort and time to track my info.... which I’m sure they will try to do.

The Bitcoin Wiki in 2011 said that scaling to Visa level throughput levels on-chain (3,000 tps!) would not be overly expensive for full-nodes.

This is not consistent with a hyper-conservative approach of keeping throughput limited at 1.67 KB/s even when transaction fees are at $50!

and therefore controversy around moderate block size increase proposals
(such as 2/4/8 rescaled to respect segwit's increase). Bitcoin will
be able to move forward with these increases when improvements and
understanding render their risks widely acceptable relative to the
risks of not deploying them. In Bitcoin Core we should keep patches
ready to implement them as the need and the will arises, to keep the
basic software engineering from being the limiting factor.”


This statement and the entire scaling bitcoin entry I linked  is on target with what satoshi said. The concept that blocksize increase is all that satoshi wanted to “eventually” happen is a complete distortion. Improving the code and defending decentralization was more important to satoshi than removing the block size limit he put in place.

The reason the larger players want to push blocksize over other solutions is that they want to cement their place in the ecosystem. They want limited competition and more control. They don’t fear centralization because they will be in the middle of the pile and in control. 

Bcashers seem to think a small window of un believe able adoption spiked fees is justification for a hard form to increase block size. It’s ridiculous.

"&gt;Its very hard to see just how big an echo chamber it is when you're inside it.

I don't really use any of the subreddits, although I watch both of them every couple days to keep updated on what company bitcoin core are boycotting this week, and to keep updated on BCH proposals and developments. As a crypto investor since 2012 that made a majority off his net worth off crypto-startups and more recently shorting bitcoin (btc), I treat anything posted in both communities as wishful thinking, and make my own conclusions based on experience and outside information. That aside /r/btc is the least echo-chamber sub in crypto reddit, where discussions of all sides are actively promoted and discussed.

&gt;Its a fact that economic freedom can indirectly cause death doesn't mean that high bitcoin fees leads to less economic freedom and death. It simply doesn't follow logically from that. It might be true, it might not be, but you can't tell from just putting those two pieces of information together.

Bitcoin was made mainly to promote economic freedom and uncensored money. I'd say pricing out 80% of the world, living on less than $10/day, goes against those principles.

&gt;both are there as life support to bcash. 

I'd say it was more life-support for Bitcoin Core. Bitcoin Cash transactions are very costly and almost impossible to double-spend, hence for smaller sub $1k transactions there's no need to wait for a confirmation. When this was going on Bitcoin Core on the other hand was entierly unusable, and as soon as fees were at a more ""reasonable fee"" level of 40% of the average transaction, people dumped all their BTC into altcoins, (as I did into BCH at $400, when the S2X fork was about to cancel and swing-traded BCH all the way up to 0.5 BTC, before all the exchanges were hit with a tbps ddos attack and taken down for the subsequent peak crypto trading hours and returned to the mean of 0.2BTC)

&gt;It would simply not stand on its own merits. It did not have enough support when it forked, not in the community, not from miners.

Is that why we had the majority hashrate every other day until we implemented the hardfork, and literally the only mining pool still supporting you were slushpool? We saved your ass ;)

&gt;tx count would say otherwise. Dogecoin and LTC has more transactions. Bitcoin Cash is still a dwarf compared to bitoin and ether (and the fake crypto ripple), and many others. Growing percentage wise from 0 is not very impressive.

You can't use dogecoin for commerce and Litecoin has less much less merchants than BCH, so this point is kind of irrelevant. BCH is the fastest growing coin **ever** in terms of merchant adoption, and for TX count, BCH does batching really well, and has been growing steadily despite the crypto market being on suicide watch. For the other coins, Eth isn't relevant to this discussion and ripple, although centralized is sound, and has a large community which is why 7% of all crypto invoices received on my sites in 2018 were paid with ripple.

&gt;who gives a shit.


It's the only proven scaling solution, and is hands down the most secure.


&gt;Nullifying? lol whatever. You can change whatever you want in bitcoin if you have concensus. The only thing I have a strong feeling about not changing is the coin generation. Being afraid to diverge from an initial version of a protocol is idiotic.

Segwit wasn't a consensus fork. It had 10% miner support until the new york agreement was proposed, and was forced on us by a AXA/bilderberg-backed development team. It still has zero support, but has forever tainted the bitcoin with anyone-can-spend transactions making it impossible to revert bitcoin.",1523225782

"&gt; Hubs are a fiction entirely created by Lightning detractors.

Yeah, of course. [Hubs are just fiction.](https://lnmainnet.gaben.win). 😅

&gt;These may also be hidden.
Read the article.

&gt;Another step developers plan to look into in the long term, he said, is making both components - the marketplaces and the watchtowers - invisible to bitcoin users.
&gt;""Ideally within our application, this is all abstracted away from the end user,"" Osuntokun said, though he added the goal is still to make it easy for ""power users"" with more tech experience to construct and run their own towers.
&gt;But if the Lightning Network becomes the go-to channel for everyday bitcoin transactions, this vigilance would become quite burdensome. As such, the watchtower concept allows users to outsource the ""eternal vigilance"" to other entities, who will send users a message should something look awry.

Since Lightning Network can't scale on-chain and become trustless, they have to outsource that to a third party. It destroys the point of the blockchain in the first place. Bitcoin was invented to circumvent the third party.

So now we have a sidechain where it is coded into the protocol that third parties will get paid to surveil the network. But you said it won't ""invade your privacy""! Obviously a hub will have enough power of itself to surveil, but nothing wrong with just controlling and surveilling your own channels. 

&gt;False. Lightning runs on top of and requires Bitcoin. It can remove nothing, but it can (and does) add value.

LN piggybacks and steals profits and censorship resistance given from miners. If it didn't, why wouldn't we just have one miner mining and do all of our transactions on LN, since all it does is just ""add value"".

&gt;False. The user would just force close the channel and receive their funds back. There is also nothing stopping them from opening additional channels to other nodes (or even merchants directly).

So you believe that LN won't turn into a centralized system controlled by a few actors who obviously provide KYC and whatever else the government or banks want?  Given it doesn't turn out to be complete vaporware of course?  But I can give you that it might not be that easy to reverse transactions, for that you would need to fork. But transactions are already irreversible onchain, so no news there.

&gt; False. Every full node verifies that nobody creates new bitcoin except by the pre-defined rules. Fractional reserve banking is impossible on Bitcoin, unless the rules change to allow it (I would never allow such a thing, even if that means my node splits from the rest of the network).

Maybe you should read up on the definition? 

**Fractional-reserve banking is the practice whereby a bank accepts deposits, makes loans or investments, but is required to hold reserves equal to only a fraction of its deposit liabilities.**

Just because I go into a bank that practices fractional-reserve banking and owns 1 dollar and they give me 10 dollars doesn't mean that they **exist**. That is the whole point of it. They are lending you money that doesn't exist, and they are allowed to because... gubmint.

&gt;Can you explain how exactly unbacked USDT makes BTC fractional reserve? That makes zero sense.

I guess I should have said blockchain and not Bitcoin. I used Tether as an example, and using USD instead of BTC wouldn't change much. 

You will also have a slight problem when people want to be a part of the new hub and they suddenly don't get to control the private keys, or when the LN hubs suddenly starts issueing IOUs, like checks and whatnot. Going to your local hub and asking for a check to pay for things would be convinient when the on-chain transaction costs approached $100 USD. 😅

"I've seen no evidence to suggest that @bitcoin was taken over by bch promoters. It looked like the guy running it liked bitcoin for its fast/cheap transactions before segwit and full blocks were added to btc. Is it so hard to believe the same guy decided that bch which still has those properties is superior and more closely follows what bitcoin was? There wasn't an appropriation by bch. Both btc and bch have the same genesis block. Bitcoin was always open source and has never been anyone's brand or property, it's an idea and a great one at that. What I see as confusing is the naming of what is now called Bitcoin as that. Bitcoin was a very different coin from the one we see today. It was never meant to have full blocks, be slow, or have transaction fee be even $0.2 let alone tens of dollars. It was meant to change the world and you can't do that by pricing out those people in much poorer countries. I agree that calling bch Bitcoin is problematic. The way I see it Bitcoin died with Segwit, full blocks, the blockstream take over etc. I don't blame people for saying 'bch is bitcoin' necessarily because what they mean is that bch is the coin that actually is does what bitcoin did and has as much a right as btc to call itself that given they're both forks of the same original bitcoin, but as you say it is confusing when two coins are claiming the same birthright if you will.",1523225434

Indeed it isn't. We should be aware that we're using a system where a transaction starts out with very low safety, and each confirmation (including the first) adds a round of ultra high safety to it.

*****
&gt; Institutional investors have not shown much of an interest in Bitcoin until very recently.

&gt; No More &amp;quot;Bitcoin Bubble&amp;#039; Talk. All of these developers come at a curious time. George Soros, for example, called cryptocurrencies a bubble in January of 2018. Less than three months later, he wants to dip his toes in cryptocurrency trading. Whether or not his comment was designed to crash the price, will always remain a mystery. The end result is how Bitcoin lost over 40% of its value. With the dip now ending, the&amp;quot;big guns&amp;quot; are moving in.

&gt; If institutional investors truly buy Bitcoin in decent quantities, a new uptrend should begin forming pretty soon.

"&gt; This sub is no more an echo chamber than reddit as a whole is a echo chamber

Its very hard to see just how big an echo chamber it is when you're inside it.

&gt; See Venezuela as a perfect example of people who are starving to death because of lack of economic freedom, and inflationary socialist government.

As I said, I expected you to try to defend this non-sequiter. Its a fact that economic freedom can indirectly cause death doesn't mean that high bitcoin fees leads to less economic freedom, or death. It simply doesn't follow logically from that. It might be true, it might not be, but you can't tell from just putting those two pieces of information together. And when no one calls out obvious bullshit like that (except me who gets downvoted) you do have an echo chamber. And thats just the most recent piece on this sub.

&gt; I am aware of both the EDA and DAA - both are there as life support to bcash. It would simply not stand on its own merits. It did not have enough support, not in the community, or from miners. That, coupled with it actually forked off under no pretense as being a network upgrade disqualifies it as any contender for the bitcoin name.

&gt; Pretty much since launch BCH has been the fastest growing cryptocurrency in terms of merchant and user adoption, 

tx count would say otherwise. Dogecoin and LTC has more transactions. Bcash is still a dwarf compared to bitoin and ether (and the fake crypto ripple). Growing percentage wise from 0 is not very impressive.

&gt; Both are different implementations of the bitcoin protocol

No, bcash has different blocksize, tx format, difficulty algo and lots of other things. Thats no the bitcoin protocol.

&gt; vows to follow the original scaling plan

who gives a shit.

&gt; while another one (BTC) decides to change every definition of what bitcoin is, and nullifying 70% of the original whitepaper.

"Ahh. Misunderstood. Didn’t mean to come across judgemental. 

I was in a similar position with debts that held me back for around 15 years - these were in my control and I was just lazy and misspent every penny I had. I just did not get it. I was a complete idiot and the banks loved it and handed me more and more. *The stuff I could’ve done or experienced or taken advantage of if I had just, .. stopped - sorry, I triggered myself.* I look back on those years thinking what a fool I was. The way those debts had me constrained and the way the financial system seemed to support that is a key reason why I am so pro Bitcoin today and will be for the rest of my life. 

Fortunately, I was also lucky that I could clear my debts if I just behaved differently. Which I did - but it was a big change. I lost friends and relationships. Luckily I found btc (I was looking for months for something that I felt I could truly own, just me, under my direct control - nothing fit the bill until I read about Bitcoin on Flipboard one day) and I spent from late 2013 accumulating with every bit of spare cash (not pocket change but not thousands) and then went all in 2014/15/16/17 and also caught the ETH presale (sold after the DAO though and bought back in at a year or so later). 2014/15 were great times. 

I do talk about this regularly with my wife and if I had a choice of either btc or pay my debts off it would have to be pay my debts off. I would lose life changing money but that day I made my last payment (I paid off my debt with only my income not any btc gains) it was a big middle finger to 15 years of being a wage slave, not being able to think about owning a home, worrying about next weeks food or even to just taking a chance on myself. Never will they have me in that position again. *I Triggered myself again. *

I have financial freedom now and have the ability to chose how I spend my time and also the ability to use the word ‘no’ which was completely unimaginable only 5 years ago. I owe bitcoin more than I can say but I thank my past self everyday for clearing those debts. 

You are right though, it has been one hell of a ride. Crazy to think we’re not even 10% through :)",1523223146

"Now ask yourself: Why do you need a currency decoupled from central government, what does it solve? Is a currency decoupled from central government the goal itself or the means to something else? 

Now read this with me, and I will put the problems what Satoshi tried to solve in bold: 



&gt;Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely **non-reversible transactions** are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation **increases transaction costs**, limiting the **minimum practical transaction size** and cutting off the possibility for **small casual transactions**, and there is a broader cost in the **loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non-reversible services**. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary of their customers, **hassling them** for more information than they would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party.

&gt;What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party. Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers. In this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions. The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes. 


So Satoshi is stating the following problems:

* Commerce on the internet is depended on financial institutions. 

* Transactions can always be reversed

* The minimum practical transaction size is limited

* Merchants must hassle their customers for information


Now Satoshi creates Bitcoin which makes the following possible:

* direct transactions between a computer to another computer without a thirth party in between. 

* transactions, even a coupe of seconds after making them are hard to reverse and as time go on they become harder to reverse and eventually practically impossible to reverse. 

* The minimum transaction size with Bitcoin is much lower because the costs of the payment system are shared with the entire network with a financial reward for those that run the network (the miners) 

* Merchants after receiving their payment don't have to worry about a reversal and so don't need to hassle their customers anymore. 


Now let's look at Bitcoin Core with replace by fee and a 1 MB block size limit

* direct transactions are possible but only when their is not fee war going on, when a fee war is going on not every user can afford to make direct transactions. 

* transactions are reversible because of replace by fee until they are put in a block, this become unreliable when the blocks are full because you don't know when your tx will make it in to a block and you don't know the fees all the other users are currently using. So you have to guess the fee and have no idea anymore when your transaction can no longer be reversed. 

* The minimum transaction size becomes unreliable because it depends on a fee war going on, when close to 400 000 tx a day are being made the minimum transaction size grows beyond the ones in the current financial system where merchants pay between 10 - 30 cents per transaction. 

* Merchants and customers don't know when the transaction will be finalized when the blocks are full. Only when the blocks are not full can they rely on the system. 




So if Satoshi was going to solve something and he called the solution to these problems; Bitcoin. And you have  Bitcoin that still solves these and you have a Bitcoin that has made some of them worse ... then why would one Bitcoin not have the right to be called Bitcoin?

The “core dev are a cartel” meme only works on noobs. The concept that a large group of developers with a multi year road map and a focus on security and optimization should be ridiculed because Jihan wants to keep using his empty block mining boosted miners is so transparent. If you don’t like segwit, don’t use it. If you don’t like lightening don’t use it. If you think a coin with decreasing mining rewards can survive in the absence of fees you are retarded. ",1523222385
"It's hardly been hijacked and in no way is it impersonating something.

Everyone who is a Bitcoin Cash supporter today was a Bitcoin supporter before the fork. That includes the owner of Bitcoin.com, the owner of the @bitcoin Twitter handle, and a multitude of others who have been accused of selling out or being compromised in some way. 

Bitcoin Cash is a fork of Bitcoin, performed by Bitcoiners who fundamentally disagree with the roadmap the Core developers have committed to following. Long before scaling was a hot topic, it was widely accepted that in the event that developers or miners ever went rogue, the solution would come in the form of a hard fork.

We may be in the minority, fighting an uphill and possibly impossible battle against what we believe to be rogue developers, but our support for Bitcoin is unquestionable. And these so-called ""compromised"" accounts are just Bitcoiners who chose the minority side. ",1523222385

"To clarify, I said ""my opinion"", because this sub has many different opinions, and I don't want to speak for all of them. Every other day you see day-1 community members attacking Roger, attacking Craig while being pro-BCH. This sub is no more an echo chamber than reddit as a whole is a echo chamber, or /o/ is a anti-supercar echo chamber. Everyone here has different opinions, and as long as a couple hundred people in this community also hold the same belief, they'll get more than enough visibility, and if the post promotes good discussion, none of the tens of thousands other users will downvote it.


I'd also like to point out that right before the Mew v. Roger debate at deconomy, Roger gave a presentation explaining why Bitcoin Core has priced out economically disadvantaged countries from Bitcoin with $200 fees and up to 1 week confirmation times, and as a result were forcing people in those countries to use their FIAT, which has since fallen and caused people to literally die. See Venezuela as a perfect example of people who are starving to death because of lack of economic freedom, and inflationary socialist government.


The reason for the DAA upgrade was because miners follow whichever chain is more profitable, which caused everyone to switch to BCH, create a large influx of blocks in a short time, then after the difficulty upgrade, switch to BTC which was suddenly more profitable vice versa, causing both chains to effectively hault for multi-hour periods every other day. Pretty much since launch BCH has been the fastest growing cryptocurrency in terms of merchant and user adoption, whereas Bitcoin Core has been bleeding into alts at a 100x faster rate, so trying to belittle Bitcoin Cash by calling it ""bcash"" and saying its dying, goes counter to any economic definition of success.


Bitcoin Cash = Bitcoin (Cash), Bitcoin Core = Bitcoin (BTC). Both are different implementations of the bitcoin protocol, only one (BCH) vows to follow the original scaling plan, while another one (BTC) decides to change every definition of what bitcoin is, and nullifying 70% of the original whitepaper.",1523221725

"&gt; The only entity with enough collateral to become a lightning hub will be a bank

**False**. Lightning channels are currently funded by **one party only**. In the future they *will be able to be* funded by both parties, but they don't *have* to be. As such, only the end user needs funds in order to open a channel, **no collateral required**.

&gt;That hub will earn profits from channeling payments to other nodes.

**All** nodes with at least one incoming and one outgoing channel earn profits from routing payments.

&gt;Watchtowers will be able to watch channels and help shutdown nodes to prevent fraud or otherwise

**False**. Watchtowers (will, they don't exist yet) perform one function only. They watch the blockchain for the inclusion of a unilateral channel closing of an old state (cheating). When they see this, they broadcast the pre-arranged penalty transaction provided by the other party. They *only* can watch for these cheating transactions if the corresponding node asks them to. If Lightning were centralized, Watchtowers wouldn't be necessary, since cheating would be a legal violation by the bank.

They **cannot** close channels or shutdown nodes.

&gt;These may also be hidden. 

I'm not sure what this even means.

&gt;Lightning Network deliberately removes the trustless nature of on-chain transactions.

**False**. Lightning runs *on top of* and *requires* Bitcoin. It can remove nothing, but it can (and does) add value.

&gt;A lightning hub can certainly ""freeze"" assets. If they own enough of the channels, they can just deny the user access.

**False**. The user would just force close the channel and receive their funds back. There is also nothing stopping them from opening additional channels to other nodes (or even merchants directly).

&gt;Given that the hub has enough share of the network (LN is extremely centralized) the user couldn't really make much use of their funds.

Again, complete nonsense and I don't even understand what you're trying to say.

&gt;Also, there is nothing that hinders fractional reserve banking from existing on Bitcoin.

**False**. Every full node verifies that nobody creates new bitcoin except by the pre-defined rules. Fractional reserve banking is *impossible* on Bitcoin, unless the rules change to allow it (I would never allow such a thing, even if that means my node splits from the rest of the network).

&gt;Tether, who has not yet verified that they have all the 2 billion ""dollars"" they have printed, are essentially doing it as we speak.

Can you explain how exactly unbacked USDT makes BTC fractional reserve? That makes zero sense.",1523221496

&gt;However, by October 2017 he had contrasting opinions by going on to say that blockchain and cryptocurrencies are the next generation technologies.

Excluded from this tax are transactions valued less then 1000 PLN (€250), and tranactions in which VAT taxation occurs - co if you exchange your BTC for goods or services that are VAT taxed, the other party does not have to pay this ""stamp duty"", because it forwards from you VAT tax payment (23%).

Of course selling BTC to PLN, or exchaning BTC to ETH, or buing goods with BTC falls under income tax, so higher rate then capital gains.

"&gt; Deposit USD to savings account (address) at the bank (Bitcoin network) to pay a merchant with VISA (Lightning Network) by exchanging USD (Bitcoin) for VISA credits (LN Coin), which creates a debt obligation that will be settled once USD is received (channel closed).

You have a complete misunderstanding of how the banking system works.

It is very important to understand the difference between a credit account and a deposit account. 99.9999% of all accounts today are credit accounts, meaning that as soon as you deposit your money in the bank, it gets loaned out.

The balance in your account, which is a credit account, is not USD, it's money-substitute and is only valued in a 1:1 ratio to the USD, as long as all other banks that accept payments from your bank believe, that the bank is liquid. As soon as this belief vanishes, like in a crises or bank-run, the balance in your account is worth zero USD. Compare that to cash, which is always worth 1:1 the the USD.

A company that actually does deposit bank accounts is GoldMoney. They store actual physical USD bank notes in vaults and you can transfer property title of them via electronic payments. So you have the money USD (or Gold, or Bitcoin) and you are transacting using the ""currency"" GoldMoney-payments.

If you want to see LN in a banking analogy, this is it. It's not a perfect analogy, because in bitcoin the money is the currency and vice-versa, but it comes closest. LN transactions are bitcoin transactions, they are simply not settled yet, but in contrast to zero-conf transactions, a smart-contract between the transacting parties minimizes the risk between the parties.

"DAI doesn't work that way - there isn't one organization that says ""hey this is worth $1 now, and we'll provide the liquidity in both directions necessary to make that happen.""

DAI is worth $1 because it can always be exchanged for $1 worth of the collateral that's backing it - right now that's only ETH, but in the future they're working to have other collateral sources as well (like DGX, which is good since the price of gold isn't correlated strongly with the price of crypto).

The total supply of DAI is over collateralized - currently there's over 200% collateral backing the current supply of DAI. I'd be happy to explain the mechanics of how all this works but I probably wouldn't do as good of a job as if you read the whitepaper or [their article explaining it](https://medium.com/makerdao/introduction-to-dai-2e65626e65a7).

Essentially, if the price were to ever be significantly above $1, that incentivizes people to lock up collateral to create more DAI to sell it, and if the price ever drops significantly below $1 that encourages folks with collateral already locked up to buy the DAI at a reduced price to free their collateral.

There are some other mechanisms in place (MKR dilution and global settlement) that also help with this, but that's the main mechanism.

In 2018, many retailers dropped support of Bitcoin, because of congestion.

&gt;Everyone accepting Bitcoin for payment since the creation of Bitcoin has had to deal with the reality that a confirmation can take an hour or more, completely naturally due to variance, even with empty blocks.

"&gt;Bitcoin Core doesn't have any right to monopolize the Bitcoin name

What does this have to do with the core development team? I'm taking about the consensus network called Bitcoin. There is no ambiguity.  Or perhaps you're unaware of how consensus networks work? 

&gt;People have a right to call anything they want Bitcoin, and Bitcoin Cash is one major vision for what Bitcoin was meant to be.

Sure, I can call a cashew a watermelon. But when I try to pass off a cashew, telling people it's a watermelon, that's when I become a fraud. 

&gt;Satoshi himself said that the ultimate solution to scaling was to not care how large blocks got.

Satoshi couldn't predict the future. He was brilliant, but the reality changed. Additionally, he spoke of off chain payment channels. 

&gt;It's Bitcoin Core that forked from the original vision.

Except it didn't fork.. Bitcoin today is compatible with 2014 Bitcoin, before segwit or bcash were even invented. If you run a node from back then, it'll sync up with the current Bitcoin chain, because we never broke consensus. However, it will reject Bcash blocks, since they break consensus. 

&gt;Bitcoin Cash has every right to call itself the original Bitcoin.

No it doesn't, and this is why everyone thinks the Bcash community are frauds. You trying to pass off a cheap imitation as legitimate. ",1523218972

The rest of what you've said makes similarly little sense. Almost every single day there is at least one block that takes an hour, and always has been. Nobody gets a confirmation for an hour when this happens. Everyone accepting Bitcoin for payment since the creation of Bitcoin has had to deal with the reality that a confirmation can take an hour or more, completely naturally due to variance, even with empty blocks.

Regarding retailers, in 2013, _very_ few brick and mortar stores accepted Bitcoin, and the retailer adoption and reversal you speak of is, again, the events of years later. I mean no offense by this, but you sound like someone who has no direct memory of events in the crypto sphere prior to 2016, who got the details filled in recently by a BCH supporter.

"I don't think this is true, but it isn't really my point.

You claim that lightning network will fail, but it seems to me the solution offered by bch is to scale linearly. My belief is that a linear scaling solution will not work, and can not work. You can raise the blocksize up to a point, but the further you go the more centralization is required.

Is the value of bitcoin - or bch, in adoption? Or is the real value in censorship resistant money, from which adoption will follow? The latter, I think.

Therefore a scaling solution must provide an exponential increase in transactions per second while simultaneously keeping a lid on centralization pressure (both from mining and full node costs).

If lightning network does not work, then we are without a solution on either chain, so far as I can see. If lightning network does work out, then btc will have an exponential scaling solution while bch is stuck raising the blocksize endlessly (or fixing transaction malleability and implementing their own lightning network).",1523218423

"Check your history, plain SegWit never exceeded 40% signalling, and mostly languished for months between 25% and 35% miner support. Once the SegWit2x scam was dangled in front of miners, signaled support peaked at between 85% and 95% of hash rate support:  

https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6j23vd/segwit2x_signalling_at_90_today_i_feel_like_this/  

https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6icnhh/btcc_now_signalling_for_segwit2x_now_over_80/  

Now, this support only reached these heights because there was a promised block size limit increase to 2 MB included in the consensus agreement. That's the only way SegWit support ever exceeded 40% of miner hash rate. We in the on-chain scaling faction of the community knew from the beginning that the ""2x later, trust us"" promise was yet another duplicitous lie, and we warned about it from day one. What a shock it was that the promised block size limit increase never materialized /s.  

Since SegWit is clearly now active on BTC without the promised 2x part of the consensus agreement proves that **SegWit got added to the BTC block chain illegitimately**.

"## The explanation:

I don't make that leap. Haha. You are misunderstanding what proof of work really means. Proof of Work literally means ""Most **WORK**"" not ""*longest chain*"". 

Longest chain is a simplification, since, **as long as everyone uses the same difficulty algorithm, *they are equivalent* **. However... Someone (Bitcoin Cash) changed that, so we have to actually use the proper definition.

## Let's find how it is done in the code

That is literally how it is written in the bitcoin code, and in any competent blockchain:

I was trying to simplify, but since you don't seem to like that. The term in the code is called [chainwork](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/ded6a2afa549f693dcabb430ce0862f8631360c8/doc/REST-interface.md), or ""total work"" (But it is really just adding the combined difficulty

Then, here you have the code where it chooses between which chain it should use, in [validation.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/24133b177a8555e8d16216d0f848b6707ed60b76/src/validation.cpp), the relevant line for us is:

&gt;     struct CBlockIndexWorkComparator
&gt; ... 
&gt;           // First sort by most total work, ...
&gt;           if (pa-&gt;nChainWork &gt; pb-&gt;nChainWork) return false;
&gt;           if (pa-&gt;nChainWork &lt; pb-&gt;nChainWork) return true;

So, that line above explains which chain is actually chosen as valid. The one with the most **nChainWork**, not the ""** nHeight**"".

Now, let's take a look at how the nChainWork is calculated, in that same file,  [validation.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/24133b177a8555e8d16216d0f848b6707ed60b76/src/validation.cpp)

&gt; // Calculate nChainWork
&gt; ...
&gt;      pindex-&gt;nChainWork = (pindex-&gt;pprev ? pindex-&gt;pprev-nChainWork : 0) + GetBlockProof(*pindex);

I removed the convolutd parts to make it clear. Basically, nChainWork, is the nChainWork of the previous block plust the GetBlockProo.

And if you look at the GetBlockProof, which you can find in [chain.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/5961b23898ee7c0af2626c46d5d70e80136578d3/src/chain.cpp) you will see how you were mistaken and how it is calculated. Which yes, is the total work

&gt; arith_uint256 GetBlockProof(const CBlockIndex&amp; block)
&gt; {
&gt; ...
&gt;    // We need to compute 2**256 / (bnTarget+1), but we can't represent 2**256
&gt;    // as it's too large for an arith_uint256. However, as 2**256 is at least as large
&gt;    // as bnTarget+1, it is equal to ((2**256 - bnTarget - 1) / (bnTarget+1)) + 1,
&gt;    // or ~bnTarget / (bnTarget+1) + 1.
&gt;    return (~bnTarget / (bnTarget + 1)) + 1;
&gt;}

Please, check your sources 😇.

Hypothetical future scenario:
- Jack Dorsey, who is invested in LN, in the future implements lightning payments on twitter and take a share of that.

"On April 14th, 2018 the first episode of Blockchain Update will drop and we would like you to be a part of this moment.  Blockchain Update is a new 3D animated series about 5 crypto enthusiasts turned crypto vloggers.  The goal is to engage new and current cryptocurrency investors in an entertaining dramatic television-like animated format.   

Blockchain Update was conceived in December 2017 in a much different crypto environment.  The first episode was originally scheduled for September 2018.  However, since the crypto market has had such difficulties since January, the creators decided to produce the first episode and season early.  It is the hopes of the creators that Blockchain Update can serve to assist in the future growth of cryptocurrency.

Blockchain Update is written, animated, directed, and narrated by a team of two dedicated and talented multimedia artists both of whom are cryptocurrency adopters and investors.  They believe the mainstream media has controlled the narrative for too long when it comes to cryptocurrency.  Blockchain Update hopes to be the first drama series based on cryptocurrency that current investors and new adopters can easily relate to in a format that is sure to impress.  Blockchain Update hopes to make cryptocurrency more approachable by everyone. 

We do not cover news specific to any coin.  We cover general stories that concern the entire crypto community.  For example, the crew of Blockchain Update promotes crypto adoption in general commerce, increasing investment capital into the entire crypto market, and preventing fraud.  Blockchain Update also deals with the lives of those involved in the crypto market through the markets tumultuous ups and the downs. 

As we are all far too aware these have been some very dark days for cryptocurrency.  The creators hope the first and future episodes of Blockchain Update will bring a small ray of light to these difficult days. 

It is time cryptocurrency becomes mainstream media.  It is time for the world to see a new face of crypto.  Join the creators of Blockchain Update on our mission to change the face of Cryptocurrency.

We would love to hear your ideas for future topics to be covered.  

See you on April 14 for the first episode - ""Episode 1: Doing It Early for the Crypto Community."" ",1523216850

the methodology is seriously flawed.

To be accurate in this sort of thing requires more than simply taking the daily averages, because *not the same amount is traded every day*.  

For example, in late 2017 when price was approaching $20,000 many more people were buying into bitcoin.  Earlier in 2017 when the price was lower, many fewer people were buying/trading, so treating all days as equal is just bad math for this sort of thing.

Thankfully my credit card fully refunded me and they will deal with the litigation of going after the company.  Had I paid with crypto my money would be gone and I’d have to sue them and would probably only get a small fraction of my money years later.

"I get that there are clear elements of sketch, but I'm not seeing how it's any different from other top 10 coins. I think it's a bad idea to put all the privacy eggs in one basket (Monero), since every privacy coin is one esoteric bug (not applicable to clear-coins) away from tanking value. I consider XVG to be the LTC to XMR's BTC. I haven't bought any, but I mined a nice little stack.

The dev fuck ups worry me, but it sounds like there isn't a big team, so it's part of the territory. One of the top Ethereum mining programs has been reliably crashing display drivers on exit for at least a few months and there's much more activity on their github. There are tons of one-man crypto projects, so why would anyone be expecting day one patches at the rate of multinational corporations?

Changing the announcement date until after tax filing seems like a reasonable request. It could be that the team is going to dump after the tax deadline, or it could be, ""Hey, I just realized that we're announcing this a week before filing taxes. Let's make bookkeeping easier for everyone and push it back."" Tax is assessed for the calendar year, not April-to-April, so what does moving the announcement back get them? Partnerships require accountants and lawyers - both generally overworked leading up to the filing date. Maybe their accountants just said they didn't have time until April 17th.

The donation drive, yeah, that sets off some alarm bells, but shit like that happens with smaller coins and no one bats an eye. The lack of a premine or ICO cancels out the donation concern for me.

And the biggest argument against this all being a pump and dump is that it IS a bear market and the price IS staying steady/going up. It would be FAR more profitable to dump when the next Bitcoin spike happens. Pump and dump in a bear market seems remarkably stupid because gains in a bull market would be multiple times what they would get during a bear. And how much of the backlash has been sour grapes and others disillusioned by the general market correction?

I could be totally wrong, but nothing actually happening with XVG, and not the fever dreams of conspiracy theorists, feels out of the ordinary. If this was all happening in early February it wouldn't even be news. I'm just going to sit back and watch the fireworks. Even if things go to shit, the project is big enough that it'll come out the other side eventually.",1523215622

"to be fair - I use bitcoin cash more often to transact because of the fees.

you draw the ""bitcoin cash is controlled by bitmain"" straw man without including the ""bitcoin is controlled by blockstream"" equivalent argument.

my personal belief: scaling requires both on chain and off chain scaling - the move away from segwit2X was a disservice to bitcoin.

my only real issue with bitcoin cash is not the vision or roadmap - it's the fragmentation the split caused in the community. Incredible animosity on both sides, and this will spook adoption because it confuses the lay-person. ironically - bitcoin cash also introduces the problem that cryptocurrency hopes to solve, centralization. instead of governments or banks deciding the fate of a currency, a handful of developers do (through forced hard forks)",1523215546

If they did, apparently I did a poor job at communicating. 

So, Let me rephrase my original post;

I'm asking if anyone noticed or if they find it interesting that volume is up so much compared to when BTC was ""mooning"". And then following up by asking what they think this means for the future of BTC and how people think this is impacting the current market, what forces are driving this volume surge, etc. 

**This is the ""noob"" question I'm asking that no one seems to have an answer for**. No one noticed that these questions are a way to phrase an observation. I've simply shared a trend that I've been watching which I wanted to get more opinions on. What do you think about the volume increasing so dramatically? What forces do you think are behind it? Did you notice it as well? Do you find it interesting? Why? Do you think this indicates that BTC is much stronger than it appears? Is this a large accumulation phase effectively being disguised as a crash pattern? 

Instead, for reasons I can't begin to understand, everyone thought I wanted to know what ""volume is""...

"Have we not already learned from inflation? 

Genesis block clearly shows Bitcoin was meant to solve the situation we are all in right now.

Why Bitcoin? because BITCOIN is the leader of this whole movement. Can something better come along technology wise? sure, but nothing stops a decentralized network from  using that SAME technology. What matters is that we continue the chain - that we have genesis block. so future generations can know with certainty why it was created and why it is important to maintain the integrity of the system. 

Bitcoin has proven its resiliency over and over, and has many more battles to come. but for now it has just encountered the hardest one to date. THE BTC tag has been taken over by rogue developers. We however proved resilient to this attack, as SATOSHI intended, we FORKED to save the integrity of the ORIGINAL chain. 

Blockstream is not bitcoin, the people are bitcoin. blockstream and its sponsors have run a very efficient brainwashing campaign but if history has taught us anything, these sorts of measures only last for so long until people wake up.

"&gt; Why are people so negative about a simple **30%** drop?

We should start by using accurate numbers. 

Bitcoin peaked at $19,900 on December 17, 2017.  On February 5th, 2018 it traded as low as $5,800.  That's more than a **70%** decline. 

Even if you take the current price of $6,9xx bitcoin is still down more than **65%** from the all time high.

"TL;DR @bitcoin was pushing BCash propaganda and got shut down by Twitter.

There once was a debate on how to scale Bitcoin. The majority stood behind the devs with the technologically more advanced, but much harder, approach - Small blocks + off-chain txs. 

A minority believes that you don't need to make difficult choices, everything has already been give to the community by Satoshi, all you need is to increase the block size. (This really doesn't work, but that's a story for another day.) So last year on 8/1, this minority decided they've had enough and forked off, creating a new coin, Bitcoin Cash, or BCash.

The problem? Since then they have been hell bent on trying to hijack the Bitcoin name and ""brand"", by making arguments like ""Satoshi always wanted to scale on chain!!!"", aka ""Satoshi's Vision"". And any argument you try to have with them will, ultimately, point you to the White Paper. The ultimate appeal to authority.

One of the tricks they employed was getting hold of the @bitcoin account on Twitter. Since then, @bitcoin has been spouting BCH propaganda. Of course, most of the community was pushing back and reporting @bitcoin to Twitter for mis-representation. (It's OK if you support BCash, but you can't go around saying Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin... it isn't. It just isn't.) Twitter finally took (definitive?) action and closed the account down.

The Bitcoin community is extremely happy, the Bitcoin Cash community is extremely unhappy.

"Also Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin. Remember, if you're too fearful to say the name, you should buy in :)",1523212197
"Bcash (BCH) is an incompatible fork from Bitcoin. In a nutshell,

1. Bcash, aka Bitcoin Cash, is basically a one-man's coin, although he has quite a few influential minions.

2. This man is Jihan Wu. He is owner of Bitmain, a mining hardware (aka miners) manufacturer that produces most of all miners in the world.

3. Bitmain's miners have a secretly embedded cheat named Covert AsicBoost, which gives Jihan's mining farms (but not his customers!) advantages in mining, which results in Bitmain's monopoly in mining industry.

4. Covert AsicBoost is unintentionally disabled by SegWit, a newly activated feature with many merits that gets intensively attacked.

5. Bcash was live at the same time as the beginning of the activation of SegWit.

6. Bcash is basically 100% Bitcoin, with SegWit removed, plus a minor modification claimed to be a better scaling solution.

7. Besides Covert AsicBoost, Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded backdoor named AntBleed. It gave Jihan the power to shutdown any Bitmain miner in the world remotely.

7. Jihan publicly stated he'd attack Bitcoin with his hashpower when Bcash was being created. (He controls a significant proportion of the overall hashpower.) He also implicated he'd use AntBleed in the attack.

Note that unlike the allegations about the devs who created SegWit, Covert AsicBoost and AntBleed have solid evidence and are acknowledged by Jihan/Bitmain.

By understanding who is behind Bcash and what he has done / what kind of person he is, you can draw a conclusion by yourself. This includes 1) why Bcash came into existence? 2) why they attack SegWit?

Bcash has few developers, of which none is well recognized, and near zero development activities. Bitcoin has more than 400 developers, of which some are well recognized world leading cryptography/cryptocurrency experts. It should be easy to draw the conclusion which is better without going into any technical detail.

The problem with Bcash is not about the technology at all, although its technology is inferior. It is not even about decentralization, which it fails totally, which makes it totally valueless. It's about it is created by a cheater (AsicBoost) and backdoorer (AntBleed). Few altcoins are more scammy than Bcash.

Bcash does not resolve *any* problem in Bitcoin. It is an altcoin with virtually no users and every altcoin without many users has low fees and fast confirmation times.",1523212197

XLM- Jed McCaleb is a smart man, IBM has deep pockets and offers credibility to the project outside of crypto-land. XLM has speed, scalability, community, team. XLM will allow for increased monetary velocity not just for banks/institutions, but for everyone else as well.

SLT- Once regulatory agencies around the world provide more framework for security tokens SLT will explode. It is a platform for tokenizing real world assets. The amount of non-traded private assets in the world far exceeds the publicly traded ones. This will be an incredible revolution.

ENG- Privacy is no doubt a key feature for crypto, and ENG will provide that for any blockchain. The team is brilliant, and this coin is severely undervalued in its current price.

PRL- Novel concept to solving data storage and advertising simultaneously using the Tangle. Additionally, SHL airdrop coming soon will provide a currency for dApp on the meshnet. Bypass the centralized ISP infrastructure.

DRGN- This is more of a bet on the team and CEO (Joe Roets). I think he is visionary and DRGN will provide a US friendly platform for business to build blockchains easily.

Hell, I was a long time supporter of it and I still fell subject to it. I didn't have enough time to dig through all the history I missed jumping in and out of crypto over the years. 

But the main difference between /r/btc and /r/bitcoin is the censoring. That's why this sub was created in the first place. In /r/bitcoin, you couldn't talk about any other bitcoin clients. At the time, Mike Hern and Gavin Anderson, two of the OG developers, wanted to increase block size and wanted to gain support through a new client. Bitcoin censored all conversation about it and thus it was hard to find out which side had more support. It just so happened, a lot of people against censoring also support bch.  

Technically, BCH is still BTC. It uses the same genesis block. Technically Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoin Platinum are Bitcoin as well (and they are welcome on this sub too). But the reason Bitcoin Cash stuck around is because it is the Bitcoin a lot of people came to know and love: There's no company funding the devs, and it scales naturally without a 2nd layer.

",1523210424
"No it is not. You are wrong.

It seems you are the one who does not understand how bitcoin works. Let me teach you.

The bitcoin protocol applies the dificulty algorithm every 2016 mined blocks, increasing the dificulty to maintain a more or less average constant output of mined blocks per time unit.

If the number of mined blocks increases, the dificulty increases. Since adding more hashpower into the network increases the probability of discovering a block, then the number of mined blocks increases, that is, until the dificulty algorithm kicks in.

By addindg more hashrate to the network, the energy consumption increases, which means more money needs to be spent on energy.
So, Bitcoin mining costs increases.

Bitcoin network hashrate has trippled in the last six months. Hardware advancement is not capable of increasing the hashrate using the same energy, with the same ratio of growth of the network hashrate.

It is simple to understand. The more hash power is added to the network, the more energy is consumed, which reflects in increased mining costs.

If miners do not keep adding hashrate into their pools, their profit will decrease over time because other mining pools will see their hashrate ratio increase, increasing their chances of discovering blocks.

The info of how much money you're sending, when and to what address, and where that money came from before you had it. All those are metadata that can be used to identify you.

None of that information is created and then uploaded to a permanent public database when you deal in cash.

And you keep saying you're not going to identify your blockchain transactions while ignoring that anyone you're dealing with could both accidentally leak or deliberately sell your private information.

&gt;Using a prepaid card in some instances requires activation which requires giving some info... like an Ss.

And some you can pay in cash with no personal information, so don't use the ones that require a social security number.

&gt;The alternative is to just earn my bitcoin through work I do and use that.

So then that address is linked to your employer? Sounds more private than just getting paid in cash.

&gt;I never have to use cash

There's no way everything you want to buy is purchasable with bitcoin with no fiat or middlemen intermediate.

&gt;Am I really going to go buy $10000 worth of prepaid cards with $10000 in cash? I’m sure the bank I withdrew that from is going to find that suspicious and look into it without notifying me. Or.... I can just use some bitcoin.

Ulbricht met with DPR early on. the FBI think that the owner of Mt Gox was DPR at least at some point in time and not only Ulbricht.

CSW claimed to be at least part of Satoshi. Ulbricht and CSW both lived next to each other in Sydney, Australia early on. We now have a document stating that an address used for something was the owner of Mt Gox.

There is clearly a lot more to the story that no one will ever know nor should they know. Everyone has right to privacy, WIRED and the others exposing CSW could have been the reason he had to out himself. No one knows, nor should they.

Is it weird that Ulbricht and Satoshi met. That the FBI think the owner of MtGox was DPR at some point. That ""Satoshi"" is using the owner of MtGox's BTC address for something.

Now some of those small business can essentially survive on bitcoin transactions if they choose to do so and I personally don't care. If they sell the bitcoin they have to pay income tax.

I don't actually have a business so I can't accept bitcoin unless it's a voluntary donation. I don't sell for Fiat and I will never do so. There's no reason to go to prison for that. The capital gain laws only apply if you are selling for Fiat at a profit here. I pour a small percentage of Fiat into bitcoin when I can afford to and then spend it half of it on actual goods or services. Whether my buying power increases or decreases is actually almost impossible to tell with how volatile crypto is anyway. Generally it stays almost the same maybe within a 0.05% range since whatever I want to spend I do so almost immediately.

If I had a business and I would accept bitcoin I'd probably just hodl that small amount of bitcoin as a future 10-15 year investment. There's no point in selling a tiny amount of bitcoin for a 5% profit and I doubt people would be lining up to pay in bitcoin anyway.

"I am saying that ""Market Cap is pretty much a meaningless metric entirely"".

Interestingly enough, I think that Bitcoin and Litecoin (and Monero) are probably three of the coins from which you might be able to *somewhat* compare the relative market caps of (and get sorta-kinda decent results from)... but that's because all three of these coins are ""true fair launch"" coins. If you include other altcoins (*any* of the ""Top 30"" altcoins other than these three) then suddenly the market cap comparison becomes **totally** ridiculous, and essentially completely meaningless. So if you asked the question with ""ETH"" in the place of ""LTC"" I would answer ""Yes, the market cap comparison means basically nothing"" *even though ETH has the second largest market cap in crypto*, because the figures are highly misleading (and in the case of ETH, gamed to a significant degree). Comparing the (few and far between) fair launch coins is *slightly* different, but that's not what this chart depicts, anyway.",1523209191

Whenever the sentence can be shareable ideologically, the Bitcoin Cash is not the Bitcoin and it will never be, not we that name at least, and for someone that isn't involved into all this, using the name of a product (no matter what it is) to promote something else can be seen as a scam attempt. I'm not saying this is the intentions, I'm talking about of how this is perceived from outside this world.

Imagine someone forking from the Bitcoin (or the BCH), someway removing all the commits of the last year and claiming to be the real Bitcoin, and using a twitter account named ""Bitcoin"" to promote that coin... how you call him? The legit owner of the Bitcoin ""brand"" (account) or a scammer?

This is what happened here, instead of promoting the Bitcoin Cash for what it is: a coin competing with other crypto-currencies to be the best, someone continued with this absurd campaign that confused everyone: not just name, but the logo, the ""branding""... I find it naive and childish.",1523209070
"Sometimes all you need is a napkin and a few conservative estimations.

Conservative estimate: Each LN BTC transaction is 500 bytes. (Reality: significantly more, these are complex contracts that require a lot of witness data to solve.)

Conservative estimate: The LN is tightly meshed, yielding an average capability of participants to send funds across just two hops S=&gt;A=&gt;B=&gt;D. (Reality: It's going to be closer to seven, and we are ignoring the incredibly important liquidity requirements for this conservative model. Consession: We are also ignoring cases where less than two hops are required, using this as an average.)

Conservative estimate: Zero watchtowers or contract-bound third party fund actuators (e.g. escrow agents) participate in the network; it is literally send and receive *only*. (Reality: Smart contracts are a target feature for LN and watchtower service is a must.)

Conservative estimate: Routing data is optimally broadcast to all nodes via the same two-hop route. (Reality: Routing data will be unequally broadcast, and some nodes will not be available at some times. Rejoining nodes would have to download the entire current network state, but could be spared its history.)

Napkin: Given bytesize *s* and hops *h*, for a network of participant size n we can define the expected network overhead of a single payment with *o = sn(h+1)*. This is a ""best case"" scenario where every transaction reaches each participating node precisely once and no routing conflicts ever occur. Now we plug in the conservative estimates and get *o = 1500n*. We can then derive the total network overhead of the protocol: given *a* transactions per second across a network of size *n*, the network overhead for time *t* in seconds is *p = snta(h+1) = 1500nta*. Given a ten-minute (one block) timespan and a maximum-for-Bitcoin capacity of 3.5 transactions per second, we get *3150000n*. So, to maintain the network to Bitcoin's peak capacity, each LN node must transmit 3.15MB of data every ten minutes, given a load of comically conservative estimates. We've overlooked all sorts of extra overhead, too: double propagation, relay failures, participant changes, routing failures, watchtowers, smart contracts, and all the game theory questions that are raised by the security model of LN. I think the conclusion here is obvious at this point; given *p = snta(h+1)*, no matter what, *p* increases exponentially as *a* and *n* increase. As the number of transacting nodes increases linearly, the network overhead increases exponentially. As it is commonly called - the O(n^(2)) problem.",1523209057

"In Poland we have VAT. It’s like sales tax. Whatever you buy in a shop has VAT added.  But as an individual you don’t have to pay VAT. When individual buys something from another individual, buyer have to pay 1% TAX from this transaction.

If you decide to sell said car you don’t pay any tax. But a new buyer has to pay 1%.

This is quite uncommon situation for the vast majority of people. There are usually just 2 cases when you pay this: when you buy used car or real estate. No one really bothers to pay this when they buy electronics or something. If you buy said used iPhone for like $500 from someone, how big trouble you might have for not paying $5 tax?

In fact polish tax law is even more restarted. In Poland you have to pay income tax from getting richer. It means that beside from closest relatives if you receive something valuable you have to pay income tax from the value of said gift.

So let’s say I’ll give you an iPhone that’s worth $999, you have to pay now 19% from this $999.

Now think about that every BTC fork puts you in exactly this kind of situation. In fact every polish tax payer after bitcoin cash fork should pay income tax from the amount of BCH they get richer about.

Hanlon's razor is an aphorism expressed in various ways, including:

""Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.""

It recommends a way of eliminating unlikely explanations for a phenomenon (a philosophical razor). And as an eponymous law, it may have been named after Robert J. Hanlon. There are also earlier sayings that convey the same idea dating back at least as far as Goethe in 1774.

"You get the fees, and each fee can be alot higher if everyone can use each transaction many more times as per my exacmple. That's why there needs to be limited blockspace. If there is always space in the blockchain then every transaction will be very cheap. 

Currently there isn't pressure on the blockchain so it's very cheap to transact. But we saw in december that people were willing to pay alot to use the network. Now we don't necessarily wanna go back to those fees for a single transaction. But if LN means I just need to transact on the blockchain once per month and afterwards can use that for 100s of transactions then higher fees are very reasonable to pay.

Bitcoin's a lot more efficient in buying small stuff. I think it's essentialy made for day to day purchases like groceries.

Mother Bitcoin - slow as fuck, not suited for everyday transactions.  Good as a store of value and is the gold standard for Crypto.  Has suffered exploits as well.

Etherium - ERC20 platform best know as a platform for shitcoins as well as some use case. Dropped massively recently.  Not suitable for everyday transactions.  Was exploited for 2 weeks straight.

Ripple - Total pile of shit coin, centralized platform for banking transactions offering partnerships that can use the network, but no the coins to no value of the people actually holding the coins.  Less than half in circulation.  Owners are billionaires.  

Bitcoin Cash - Insider traded Bitcoin fork.  About all I know or care to know

Litecoin - Another exploited coin.  Founder dumped entire stack at ATH, since then it has done nothing but lose value.  So there's your soft exit scam if you really want to know.

Then rounding out the next ten is a collection platforms and currencies that all have questionable use cases, their own sets of unique issues, and may or may not be there.

So what you should really understand is that they are all shitcoins in their own special way.  Every one of them has done something shady to get where they are and keep going.

"Indeed there is no guarantee about anything. Every choice is a gamble. But really - as others here have said - what can we do? Let me ask based on different scenarios. I hope to hear your reply if you have time.


1

Assuming you are here for global p2p currency in addition to wealth, this is still the ground floor. p2p cash narrowly escaped being strangled in the crib and there are plenty of existential challenges remaining. We should expect hard work, pain and uncertainty on the way to the top. Also on that assumption, BTC is captured so regardless of price and adoption, it will never be global p2p currency. No?


2

If your priorities lean more toward medium-term wealth/speculation, I would say a similar thing for the same reasons - BCH is your best shot at making a killing in the medium term. BTC is captured and in the process of being neutered. Can Blockstream, DCG etc really beat BCH with their gimp, a global corporate currency? I don’t believe it. In fact, I think the BCH fork seriously fucked up their plans. Do you think ETH can compete with BCH? POS ETH?

If you run an old software, you won't be able to use the new transaction methodology that prevents transaction malleability, since that is part of the new code.

In any case, **Nobody sees lightning transactions**. Lightning ""transactions"" are simply bitcoin scripts:

- If nobody is cheating, they just look like normal 2 on 2 multisig. 

- If someone is cheating, the script looks a bit more complicated.

What Segwit allowed is monitoring the bitcoin network by only requiring the transaction ID of what you are trying to monitor, rather than having to read each transaction, finding out what script corresponds to it, and deciding whether that looks like it might be from a lightning channel you are monitoring or not.

## Why can't Bitcoin Cash support SegWit transactions if they're just a soft fork?

They don't support segwit because of politics, they could implement it tomorrow if they really wanted... it wouldn't take a lot of effort, everything is already coded already.

However, they have been claiming for a long time that segwit is insecure, flawed, etc... So they will probably fix malleability at some point with their own solution.",1523206323

For an average of five hops (making this number up), that would make five liquidity broadcast to all the network. I hear the average transaction size in Bitcoin is 500 bytes. That's not very big. I don't know the actual size a liquidity broadcast would be, but I don't think it would be that much smaller.

Even if the broadcast is only 100 bytes, it still wouldn't bring any advantage compared to on-chain broadcast transactions.

Remember, what LN aims to do is only have messages exchanged between nodes on a payment route, to avoid having a noisy protocol. But having to broadcast the liquidity change of a channel with every payment ruins everything.

The alternative is to have a few trusted nodes in a hub and spokes model, but centralization is bad...

"Conspiracy and feels?  r/bitcoin is censored.  The block size was artificially held at 1 megabyte despite calls for an increase, which wouldn’t harm Bitcoin at all, at least for an increase like 8 megabytes.  These are facts that are available to anyone willing to look.  

I rarely actually see technical arguments against BCH.  Pretty much the only things I see are that it’s supported by Roger Ver, Craig Wright, etc.  There are also the very compelling arguments of “bcash,” “btrash,” and “bcrash.”  ",1523205747
"&gt; It’s likely that at some point some event will cause bitcoin or a major altcoin to rise in value massively

It's actually very unlikely now, as I said there's no new money to sucker into it. ",1523205742
Bitcoin have never been about trust. A trustless protocol is the core of Satoshi's idea.,1523205714
I’m glad you guys are also in the gambling front this will be the next big thing in the crypto space ,1523205696
"When people say ""it's still early"" are they just lying? Even teens and old grandmothers know about bitcoin now.",1523205618
Trx and verge speaks to the idiocy of crypto investors in general. It’s okay let them crash and burn ,1523205611
Well I'm going to go out on a limb and say that if we suddenly learn that a rabid foaming BCH fan holds 1M BTC then BTC price is going to tank like a motherfucker and BCH price will go up more than a little.,1523205593
"Cryptocurrency, especially Bitcoin, has been around longer than 2011. I think it was formed around 2005.",1523205567
"like I said. go read some math, data structures etc. If you read a bot you'd understand what blockchain can deliver much better than other data structures. Again you are fucking mixing up block chain, solidity, crypto, erc20, markets whatever. Throwing everything into the mix like a boss. I wont fall into the trap of actually initiating a discussion. Start by reading Princeton bitcoin book. It needs some iq but not too much. You can google it.",1523205561
So how else do you pay taxes other than selling it for Fiat and then paying a percentage of that as your taxes? Nobody even knows how much bitcoin you have or whether you even have any. You can't pay taxex with bitcoin. Up until someone comes up with a legit alternative you either hodl and forget about it or cash out everything. Still I doubt the government cares about your 0.2 bitcoin hodlings compared to the rest of your salary. ,1523205555

People don’t get why licensing is important they just think... that everything is a go in the crypto space . ,1523205472
Today is a good day as bcash loses one of its primary propoganda platforms. Thats what happens when you play bcash as BTC.,1523205471

"Its going up because people are smart enough to know

1. Verge was not hacked. 
2. It was a mining exploit. An exploit that has been done to Ethereum, Bitcoin, Litecoin and monero.
3. Verge dev fixed this issue within 72 hours, Faster then the coins listed above.
4. The exploited coins are locked and now worthless. If anything the supply just shrunk by that much.
5. The Partnership is real. And as many of you who think its fake the people with real money are going all in. That is why it keeps going up, duh!
6. It is an exclusive partnership. 
7. Partner is a house hold name.
8. Partner has global marketing capabilities.

Make the claim that Twitter deleted the @Bitcoin account because of Square's investment in Blockstream and Lightning Labs, no proof required!

Make the claim that it *looks* like the @Bitcoin account may have been bought due to a complete 180° from promoting Bitcoin to Bitcoin Cash, **omg sho me teh prooves!!!**.",1523205395
"Okay, but you're not appreciating what. I'm telling you, which is that **market cap is a joke of a metric in the first place**.

I can release a new ERC20 token named ""MarketCapJokeCoin"" which has a supply of 100,000,000,000,000 tokens, and then sell one of those tokens for $1 to a friend of mine. My coin's market cap now represents well over **99%** of the ""Total Crypto Market Cap"" figure, and reduces Bitcoin's share (even by your silly ""top 5 only"" measurement) to &lt;0.1%.

Does this mean my coin is really that important? No, obviously not.

And before you reply with ""But CoinMarketCap might not list your coin"" or something ridiculous like that, realize that this isn't an actual, meaningful argument... I could bribe them, or I could work harder to make my ""market cap manipulation"" less obvious / more subtle, like other altcoins and tokens do... the point still stands. The principle has been demonstrated.

**The ""market cap"" metric is bunk, period.** It's gameable, and gamed (to varying degrees). That's that.",1523205390

"100% agree with your points. 

McAfee admits freely to shilling for hire yet this shit is upvoted to the top of the BTC sub.

Either everyone here thinks they're smarter than the markets or a lot of people take it seriously. 

Either way it doesn't look great to the general public nor does it help the long term legitimacy, and thus valuation, of BTC to so highly promote such a crass, stale, and oft used anecdote tweeted by such a dubious character. 

This is /r/wallstreetbets tier content. 

Though given the commonalities between the way they worshiped Skhrelli and many are adulating McAfee here I'm guessing there is more overlap there than would be... Desirable. ",1523205353
"I see your view, it is a very libertarian view which the Bitcoin the community natural leans that way.

It is also a libertarian view that Twitter as a private entity has a right to ban accounts they feel hurt their image.",1523205328
"No joke, the one thing I think crypto would be great for is eliminating advertisements from the web.

By allowing viewers to mine small amounts of digital currency instead of seeing ads, it monetizes content online and promotes development of it.",1523205284

"To be clear, I’m not trying to be inherently negative. I just get a bit frustrated when the community acts as though price action isn’t at all important. BCH is in dire need of market movement to regain some ground on btc. We’ve had the SVC, DA, and decent media coverage with little action. I have high hopes that it resurgence at some point, but the OP note on SK trade volume is yet another indicator that BCH has much more work to do. ",1523205216

Your post is FUD desguised as a genuine question. Get a life an accept the fact that Verge is a fully functional crypto currency unlike a lot of Whitepaper tokens in the top 30. There was a hack but that's excepted in the software world. It's not addressed. It didn't pay McAfee he promoted it before he realised he can make money of his indorsements. Verge asked the community for money for a partnership because verge didn't have an ico or a premine so the money has to come from the community unless the DEVs start eating into their own share everytime there is a partnership,1523205107

"On February 26th, 2018, [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/80ejcx/dave_kleimans_estate_sues_craig_wright_for_10/) lawsuit against Craig Wright was posted to /r/btc.

Immediately you can see that people accepted the ""evidence"" in each of the Exhibits attached to this lawsuit, and believed this was conclusive proof that Craig Wright was Satoshi, or close to the Satoshi team.

The problem is this lawsuit is complete and utter bullshit, and we can prove that the ""evidence"" in these exhibits have been 100% faked.

I believe that Craig faked these documents and fed them to Ira. Ira was enticed with the idea that he could get millions of dollars. After Craig did not give Ira anything, Ira tried to sue Craig and used this ""evidence"" in his lawsuit.

This was all set up by Craig to further reinforce the idea that he really is Satoshi.

Look at [Exhibit 10](https://www.scribd.com/document/372445144/Exhibit-10).

&gt;THIS DEED dated 22nd day of April 2011

&gt;BETWEEN

&gt;Craig Wright of Craig Wright R&amp;D (Financer)
&gt;And
&gt;Dave Kleiman for W &amp; K Info Defense LLC (Provider)

&gt;RECITALS

&gt;A. The Financer controls the following Bitcoin (BTC) addresses:

&gt;	(a) 12hRmmSda9qSSEH656zBaKEbeisH6ZhdTm.
&gt;	(b) 12C9c9VQLMrLi4Ffzq2wDvwrKnUPaAaNFp.

We can clearly see that Craig Wright is the financer and thus controls the Bitcoin address 12C9c9VQLMrLi4Ffzq2wDvwrKnUPaAaNFp.

But after reading [this](https://blog.wizsec.jp/2018/02/kleiman-v-craig-wright-bitcoins.html) article, we can clearly see that the address 12C9c9VQLMrLi4Ffzq2wDvwrKnUPaAaNFp actually belongs to the original MtGox founder Jed McCaleb.

Scroll down to the end of Exhibit 10 and Craig Wright signs the document in his own handwriting.

So either Ira Kleiman is some sort of mastermind and forged this document in an attempt to steal Bitcoins from Craig Wright, or Craig forged this document and fed it to Ira, to draw more attention to himself and make himself look like Satoshi.

When I confronted Craig about this in our private Slack channel, he couldn't provide any reasonable explanation whatsoever. He first tries to misdirect us and make it look like I'm prying into his private finances. Then he gaslights and wants me to not even be able to believe my own common sense. Then he blathers on about ASICs and other stuff that has absolutely NO relevance to the conversation. Then he gets his personal sychophant Joeldalais to defend him saying that Craig has a right to privacy.

Let me tell you. Out of all the native English speakers I know, Craig writes and speaks in the MOST broken English I have ever seen. He uses this short choppy bizarre speaking style that is hard to understand and makes no sense.

&gt;The first part is an Agreement
&gt;The Last is a deed\
&gt;Yes, I will do all I can to have anything I was doing stay private
&gt;Nothing related to Ira
&gt;And, as for contents
&gt;Non ASICs don't mine

After this conversation, I called joeldalais a mindless sychophant and I was kicked from the private Slack room that I created. I'm starting to realize that Craig Wright has his own personal shill army to back him up and change the topic whenever confronted with something damning.

All of this started coming together when I thought back to [this](https://coingeek.com/csw-backdating-claims-taken-grain-salt/) bullshit article by coingeek that basically says we can't trust WayBackMachine, and it hasn't disproved anything related to Craig.

Plus Craig has Jimmy making stupid posts like [this](https://twitter.com/JimmyWinMedia/status/978257833446666243) which in my opinion is just another attempt to reinforce the idea that Craig is Satoshi and eventually the mystery will be revealed...

I could go on and on but I think there's enough evidence at this point that Craig has not been honest, and he's all talk and seeking attention. He delivers nothing.

Here's my impression of him:

&gt;Things are coming. Competition. Creation. BCH to be all it can be. Infrastructure. As for Greg, he is nothing. I never back down and will continue to fight.

Just a bunch of meaningless drivel that has no substance.",1523204689

Basically if you buy commodity in Poland that’s worth more than 1000PLN (around 250€) you have to pay 1% tax. Because if you would buy from a company the price would have included VAT.

This kind of transactions are very uncommon. Unless you buy directly from another person.

So for example in Poland all places that sell investment gold are legal entities that pays VAT. So when you buy it you have price increased by 23%. If you’d purchase gold from regular person (not business) you’d have to pay this 1% tax.

It does not apply to currency and polish gov refuses to recognise crypto as a currency.

"That's how economies work now. Look at stocks. Japan, USA, if you zoom out 20-30 years you'll always see a exponential run-up, downturn, then repeat. The crash of the market usually is higher than the previous high though. And the next crash will still be higher as long as the world economy grows.

That's why a lot of people say time in the market is better than timing then market. Now this is assuming the world stays in relative ""peace"". Obviously we've had a period of unprecedented growth in most nations from after World War 2 onwards that also had a huge population growth.

In a sense, it could be considered a bit like a pyramid scheme, but one that will never end as long as there's more and more people and the economy keeps growing. And one that actually adds value (debatable on your definition of value). 

I don't know if this will continue forever. Population equilibrium may be reached at some point. Also, the baby boomer generation was born in probably one of the luckiest generation in terms of economy that we've seen so far. By simply buying some stocks or a real estate, they could've been extremely wealthy. That is why I think this self serving bias hurts the younger generation. ""Just go to school and get a job"".  ""Work 35-40 years"". ""Buy a house and watch it 5x or even 10x"". ""If I did it, why can't you, you lazy bum?""

Don't think it'll crash horribly either but kinda taper off for slow growth. We'll see. Exciting times ahead of us in terms of technological innovation (both crypto and non-crypto innovation).",1523204070

"The way I've always viewed it, before Bitcoin can be adopted as a mainstream currency for every day transactions, it will need to go through a phase of eventual mainstream adoption as a stable store of value, that an ever increasing number of users believes has value and trusts the network.  

The way I view the BTC vs. BCH issue is summed up in Andreas Antonopoulos' video ""Decentralized Truth"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCVaabu3J04

Holding Bitcoin is also using it.  You can't measure this by only viewing Bitcoin usage as transactions per day.

I'm not a programmer, developer, etc.  I believe Bitcoin can be the catalyst for a lot of positive change in the world in the coming years, and right now the only way I can help Bitcoin is by holding it  and trusting it as a store of value.  

I do use Bitcoin in transactions when possible, and replace it immediately, but I'm nowhere near a point where I'm living on Bitcoin completely.  I'd like to see more merchants holding Bitcoin that they receive instead of immediately converting it to USD.",1523204053

no what matters is that DOGE gets shit done and gives economic freedom to the world.

Nothing more to be said, ""My dude""

I hope you saw my point. Names are names. Don't try to take another name, yours is fine.

6) educating people on the economics of bitcoin so they don't go paranoid thinking miners will go against the network and collude for a 51% attack

7) Acknowledging that bitcoin is turing complete which opens new frontiers

8) Recruiting new miners such as Calvin Ayre and SBI group

9) providing a clear target, digital cash, millions of transactions per second. While others try to reinvent the wheel and come up with a new store of value.

10) Educating people on network topology. Mesh vs complete. Think this is irrelevant? Btc is convinced bitcoin can scale only through LN and have 2 stores total online. The fact that they consider it a mesh is part of the reasons they think it cannot scale.*

"The current market seems to be largely driven not by organic buying and selling, but by exchange driven manipulation of the spot market to exploit the current dynamics that come from a lack of organic buying. 

We have seen several forces set an incentive for exchanges to do this:

* Consistently declining volume - this leads to lower total fee revenue for exchanges, and an incentive to manipulate the price in order to earn revenue through liquidations rather than trading fees.

* Move towards more leveraged positions - both leveraged shorts and leveraged longs are [at or near record levels.](https://i.imgur.com/ljSohM5.png) Shorts especially have gone from 8K outstanding in January to 33K right now, a whole tripling in outstanding positions. 

* Move away from the spot market and towards derivatives - Anybody who has been checking [the combined orderbook](https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/books/USD) over the last few months has seen Bitmex completely take over the market, while GDAX, Bitfinex, Gemini and others see consistent declines. I've noticed myself an increased interest across the Internet on how derivatives work and anecdoteally have seen more people move away from the HODL meme and towards trading taking high margin bets with a portion of their stack.

Some exchanges like Gemini have reacted to all of this by increasing their trading fees by 400%. Meanwhile Bitfinex seems to be using its hefty weight to manipulate the price in order to capitalize on the record number of people using margin to bet.  Since the exchanges know the characteristics of the outstanding shorts/longs, they can essentially engineer movements in price that create income in terms of liquidations. When there are lots of overleveraged shorts, an exchange can pump the price with bots briefly and collect the short position stacks after it liquidates them. Same with longs but in reverse, a quick burst of selling pressure. 

You can see this in the most recent pumps, where 1K buy orders appear out of nowhere after long sideways movement only to be followed by either sideway movement or slow bleed on pathetic volume:

https://i.imgur.com/bpo5oOC.png

Take a look at the most recent pump up to 7K, it instantanously liquidated about 700 short positions:

"&gt; I've been interested in cryptographic voting for years.

For governance, crypto voting and liquid democracy you may find Decred interesting.

It has an _already working_ system where coin holders have the sovereignty. It remotely resembles liquid democracy in that you either vote directly or delegate your chosen voting preference to a stake pool but can revoke it any moment. The difference is it is not ""1 person 1 vote"" but your power is proportional to your stake, your ""skin in the game"". Therefore easily faked social media accounts or full nodes can ""vote"" whatever they want but the final say comes from real holders. Other difference is you only delegate to cast your choise for you, not to choose for you. Two hardfork votes already took place with 87% and 62% participation respectively. I expect future votes to have decreasing % but it cannot go lower than 10% else the vote has no effect and is restarted.

Vitalik writes extensively about governance, and together with Vlad he criticizes ""on-chain governance"". But the systems he talks about either don't have direct voting in base protocol or worse, are ""promiseware"" projects not yet fully delivered: Tezos, EOS, Casper, etc. For unknown reasons he and others avoid talking about Decred, which is in production for 2 years now.

Cryptocurrencies attract a lot of people who believe that making money has nothing to do with morality.

"In the US long-term capital gains do have a lower tax burden but can be pushed all the way up to 20% depending on what tax bracket you are in. I believe the lowest you'd pay is 10% on LT capital gains and the typical payment is 15% as most people fall in these brackets.  
  
The part that you have to realize is that crypto gains are counted towards your regular income. If you make X amount of money with your day job, the crypto gains are counted on top of that to measure which tax bracket you are in. This can be problematic when you have to pay extra for your normal salary just because you made enough in crypto to push your tax bracket to the next tier.

"&gt;Sure. But why do you say 2011? Why not 2010 or 2012 or 2013 or 2014 or 2015 or 2016?

Same logic applies - Any client from any of these years will sync to the Bitcoin network.

&gt;2011 is an arbitrary choice, given the fact that bitcoin started 3rd Jan 2009.

2011 is not an arbitrary choice... I believe there was a hard fork early on, which will not make the clients before the fork sync to ANY network. From that ONE Bitcoin emerged, fully supported by the ENTIRE community. THAT Bitcoin syncs to the Bitcoin network, not the BCash one.

At the end of the day the community decides what is Bitcoin by running the nodes with the rules they want. But I don't expect you to accept that. You'll reply with ""Satoshi's Vision!!!"", or ""The White Paper!!!"", or ""Electronic CASH!!!"".  Yawn.

"We'll see in the next bullrun, when the chains have to work more. We'll see how Segwit performs and to what degree Lightning can help in early stage. 


The last argument Bcash has going for them is that currently we don't have high transactions in real Bitcoin, because transactions are lower. 


Another bullrun will come and we will see how that last argument they play is that Segwit works great. It's still only at 30% adoption by the way. 



ASICS are not the problem. Eventually it will be cheaper to purchase one for yourself and help decentralize the thing. ASICs get a lot of shit, they really don't deserve. 


But having a chain that is 25 TBs big could be a problem for decentralization. People claim that hardware will just magically get better. 


So what was a normal harddrive like 5 years ago? Like 150GB? What is the average now? I'd argue 500GBs. 


The scaling isn't there. Just like processors and graphics cards are also not siginificantly getting better. It's because there's only so much space these people can use. 



Sure, technology will get better, but eventually Bcash chain will scale into something that is 1000TB and good luck for the average person trying to get that. There you have a centralization problem. Average Joe will never get a harddrive that big. He *might* however purchase a miner for 1000$ and make money with that. ASICs ar enot the problem. 




Pools are a problem in that they have all say. However pools are also *needed* to reduce variance on your earnings. You either get the block, or you don't. People react to ""political changes"" like that. At first Segwit was blocked too, but pools aligned and shifted in such a way, that eventually it was pushed through, when it was *really* needed - when we had no other choice. 



Segwit fixes that problem. Bitcoin is *by far* the most decentralized currency out of 1600. There's promising projects that try out Proof-of-Stake. Bcash is not such a promising project and Bitcoin is totally fine the way it currently is. It's also getting better via additional layer solutions, which Segwit opens up. Ver claims that Bcash can also have Lightning, but the guy that worte the fucking paper says it cannot. And even if they can, isn't their original argument anyway that Lightning sucks and Satoshi had all that shit figured out 9 years ago already? 


You think Satoshi created the perfect tool already? What do you think he would have done, if he heard that bigger blocks result in more centralization? Bcash focuses on transactions. Bitcoin focuses on being fucking decentralized. Pretty sure Satoshi would have said the same thing, because he couldn't look into the future and predict that his ""funny paper"" will eventually lead to become a TRILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY. Yea, he thought about that already.

Particl's marketplace will used a system called MAD escrow (mutually assured destruction). This is a game-theory mechanism that pressures both sides (sellers and buyers) to behave in an honest way. 

&gt; I think this marketplace would be full of scammers, illegal products since there is no control.

The public section of the marketplace will be governed by the community (the network stakers). Being apart of the community discussions, I can assure you that we do not want this to become silk road 2.0. 

&gt; I think burglars would also love this marketplace since they can sell what they stole easily and no one can trace them.

Maybe, but they'd still need to ship it, exposing themselves in that way. Stolen stuff is sold all the time on ebay and other sites anyways and that doesn't invalidate everything else those marketplaces do.

&gt; I think future is in a coin which makes shopping with all currencies easily on a centralized marketplaces.

The move from centralized to decentralized trust will take decades.

So very few people critical from the outside have an appreciation for how early days it still is.

"**Gaslighting**

Gaslighting is a form of manipulation that seeks to sow seeds of doubt in a targeted individual or in members of a targeted group, hoping to make them question their own memory, perception, and sanity. Using persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, and lying, it attempts to destabilize the target and delegitimize the target's belief.

Instances may range from the denial by an abuser that previous abusive incidents ever occurred up to the staging of bizarre events by the abuser with the intention of disorienting the victim. The term owes its origin to the 1938 Patrick Hamilton play Gas Light and its 1940 and 1944 film adaptations.

- Bitcoin soft-forked, which means that they did a backwards compatible change. Hence, if you had downloaded any full node software BEFORE the fork, and didn't follow any politics or news, your node software would still work and it would be interacting with the Bitcoin blockchain,

- Bitcoin Cash **hardforked**, which means that they did a non-backwards compatible change. Between the changes, they changed block size and how Difficulty discovery happens. 

    That has had the consequence that they have created far more blocks than intended by design, bleeding a lot more value to miners (You should think of a block reward as a few that everyone pays to miners to keep the network).  Note that it still has less Work on the total chain, since Work is added between blocks, and the total sum of work is much smaller in bch than btc.",1523196682

"Buying/selling Twitter handles is supposedly against Twitter's ToS. The @Bitcoin account has leased OAuth2 access to another publisher in the past, this access was abruptly terminated at the start of 2018 and started promoting Bitcoin(dot)com propaganda exclusively, as well as a wide range of deceptive (fraudulent) altcoin propaganda echoing Roger Ver. The account operator and Roger Ver both claim that the account was not sold, but given the abrupt shift and Roger Ver's proclivity to throw his money around to get what he wants, I think it's likely the account changed hands. 

Now imagine if CocaCola's Twitter handle started promoting Pepsi as ""The real Coke"" all of a sudden, while trashing CocaCola. The account would likely be suspended due to impersonation or some other ToS violation. It seems like the same thing happened here. As for ""which is the true Bitcoin"", that was never a question. Bcash has always been an altcoin since its creation on August 1st 2017. Hijacking the @Bitcoin Twitter account to promote this altcoin and trash talk Bitcoin is a dirty move that amounts to fraud.

"&gt; Am I correct in asserting that you can't have the desirable properties of immutability, censorship resistance, security, neutrality, etc without the proper incentive mechanisms?

Not correct  

&gt; the security of ""blockchains"" comes from distributed users across the network who participate by virtue of self-benefiting motives

The security of Bitcoin is provided by non-mining nodes who validate every new block immediately after it is mined. The non-mining nodes work for zero financial reward  

&gt; Does each and every variation of blockchain become useless when you take economic incentives out?

The economic incentives are optional. Bitcoin worked superbly well for many years when Bitcoin mining was a penny-reward hobby. Litecoin and Dogecoin work as well today, offering minimal rewards to miners  

The other ingredients are not optional  

Terminology:  
A Blockchain is just an old database design known as a linked list, an unusual linked list because it is updated only by appending to the end, and immutable through the use of irreversible hashes. It is just a chain of data blocks  

Bitcoin's Blockchain is thousands of identical copies distributed across a network of nodes, to prevent it being censored by regulation or political interference - distributed, decentralised  

Is a centralised Blockchain useful? Yes, anywhere a linked list is the right database solution, a Blockchain could be useful. Is this relevant to Bitcoin? No  

Is a non-transaction Blockchain useful. Same answer. Yes, but not relevant  

Could a national Government, an International NGO bank, or a national Reserve bank create a currency with a centralised transaction blockchain. Yes, and it would still be a blockchain. But being centralised, it would serve no useful purpose  

&gt; why do I hear people talking about using blockchain for supply-chain management or improving transparency in government spending?

Transparency comes from immutability. Arguably, a centralised blockchain is valuable in this context, since immutability comes from the linked hashes, does not require decentralisation  

&gt; What incentive mechanism are there to keep the ledger distributed?

In the case of Bitcoin, the incentive is altruism. Unpaid non-mining nodes conribute more to the decentralisation of the Blockchain than miners. The miners only contribute the work which delays the rate of block creation and makes it impossible to alter historical hashes. Distribution of the Blockchain also prevents alteration of historical hashes, because it would require a conspiracy of all the thousands of node operators. The impossibility of such a conspiracy is the main guarantee that the ledger can not be corrupted",1523194898

The online communities were overwhelming, ridden with outright scams and charlatans, all sorts of bullshit TA graphs and charts and daytrading tips from people with zero financial credentials .

Long story short: during and right after the ATH there was just a shitload of noise. Too loud, with noise coming from every direction. But that can be said about any sphere or space on the internet these days. I didnt lose interest in crypto so much as I lost interest in noise/info pollution.

Im not on any social networks now, and check this subreddit maybe once a week.

With crypto no one can freeze your funds. Sure it’s volatile and can be hard to use as cash, but you have control. Worst case scenario, you can always sell it to someone peer to peer for some cash if you end up in a bind. So, I would suggest that everyone stop looking at this as a get rich quick scheme and see it for what it really is. Stop throwing away thousands of dollars on crypto that you can’t afford to lose.

And that's all that counts. In terms of nodes each pool behaves as a single node: it doesn't matter at all how many miners are behind it and where they are located. The situation today is: the timestamp server network consists of basically 12 peers. Fwiw, they don't even speak peer-to-peer with each other: in order to learn immediately when new blocks are stamped they have their own dedicated network.

Again, compare this situation with Satoshi's whitepaper:

&gt;&gt; Whitepaper: Proof-of-Work - To implement a distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis, we will need to use a proof-of-work system similar to Adam Back's Hashcash [6], rather than newspaper or Usenet posts.

On the other hand, Bcash has its inherent and clear use case advantages (although scalability may still be problematic). BTC was meant to be a decentralized digital currency, and Bcash is certainly closer to that end (rather than storage of wealth - or digital gold

"This is why EU residents should be very excited for **SEPA Instant Credit Transfers** which have now been introduced as a new standard in the EU \(only supported by a few banks thus far, all banks must support it by the cut\-off date\) which introduces the ability to send a payment within the SEPA zone that has to take less than 10 seconds from being sent to being received and credited to the payee account \(and 24/7 not just during weekdays from 9\-5\). Also banks aren't allowed to charge high fees for the ability to make one of these payments.

This can have really good implications on crypto too. Imagine buying crypto near\-instantly with a bank transfer instead of a card, it will allow exchanges to offer fiat buys that are as quick as a card but much cheaper \(As they don't need to worry about scammers doing card chargebacks or having to use a card acquirer / processor that takes 3\-5&amp;#37; fees per transaction\).

Miners don't have a say on that either, because the rules they follow are already set, they follow or they spend energy in vain with invalid blocks. Nodes wouldn't accept it, fees would rise and they would eventually come back. The assumption is strong with Bitcoin: even with 51% of the hashrate, you still don't set the rules and the it would probably be worth a POW change, which would make them entirely bankrupt.

Anytime a positive evolution threatens Bitmain's interests, they mount a smear campaign and convince a few dimwits to fork and use an inferior chain.

Weakening Bitcoin by creating bcash and destabilizing the hashing power for both coins ? He doesn't care. Weakening Monero by compromising the privacy through useless forks ? He doesn't care. Making more money by 'testing' his ASICs for months and shipping them just before the new generation takes over? That's the real Jihan.

Jihan doesn't give a fuck about crypto, decentralization, monetary systems, and freedom in general. He only cares about money.

And it's the same tactic each time: 1) launch a smear campaign against reputed devs who are actually working for free 2) spread FUD and conspiracy theories in order to convince hapless idiots to join him.

Keep in mind that traditional news platforms do the same thing, but you probably find it more frustrating because shitty crypto news can have a direct impact on the market.

A lot of guys running crypto news sites come from the affiliate marketing space and aren't concerned with journalistic integrity.

As a writer myself I'm not particularly triggered when crypto news sites run sensational headlines as long as the article itself explains the specifics of the situation.",1523186947
"Sure. I see it a little differently though. I think it helps first to understand that all of the people involved in Bitcoin Cash were originally passionate supporters and advocates of Bitcoin. Indeed, the conflict between the BTC and BCH communities begins to look very different once you accept that this is really just a prolonged dispute between two factions within *one* Bitcoin community. It's just that one side were forced to fork off the BTC chain in order to preserve and pursue those features that they believe are necessary to Bitcoin's integrity and success. 

I think it is worth highlighting that nobody, least of all the big blockers, wanted to fork the Bitcoin project. Everyone tried for years to prevent this very occurrence, with various agreements and compromises etc. But these agreements were broken, and now we have the situation that we have. 

At the end of the day, I think it's most positive to see these two coins as two different approaches to the scaling of Bitcoin. And we're fortunate in a way, that they are both being trialled in the real world. Yes, they are, like all cryptos, competing. But at least their relative strengths and weaknesses are no longer theoretical—we get to really see which approach *actually* works. For those actually interested in a long-term economic and financial revolution, surely this good.

Annual demand in billions of USD around 88 for Jewellery, 14 for Technology uses, as well as investment and for banks institutions, figures from World Gold Council site. Metal gold is somewhat scarce, it is beautiful, how many people don’t have something made of gold. One advantage of Bitcoin perhaps is that large amounts of money can be transferred easily. However there are companies which will hold gold bullion for you and also allow you to spend it as money.

"No my opinion is that communication channels shouldn't be so centralized anyway. Every community should have their own community channels which are censored or not censored acc to consensus in their respective circles. Right now because of the world being just homogenized America, everyone logs on to the same sites and forums everyone else is as basically all the internet services infrastructure is monopolized in a very small area. That's what I believe is a bigger problem and something we need to break free of.

Decentralization needs to happen down up not top down and all these issues will be solved. Right now people come to btc by finding these channels, so no way who has no direct pathway to these channels will ever join the conversation. So its basically an echo chamber either way right now.

Gavin’s more [recent and most relevant](http://gavinandresen.ninja/either-or-ignore) comments on Craig are that he’s either a scam artist and we should ignore him. Or, if he’s really Satoshi, he worked really really hard to make himself look like a scam artist and we should respect his wishes by treating him as such.

"I talk about this in depth [here](https://medium.com/@kellerbarnette/1-billion-of-new-mining-equipment-added-to-bitcoin-f5bbbddf2764), but it is a very big issue. In the White Paper, there were but a few points discussed, many of which are no longer valid today.

In White Paper, ""Miners"" are never mentioned. Only Nodes. It was never intended for Miners and Nodes to be significantly different.

In White Paper, it explicitly states that IP address would allow one person to accumulate more power than another. But that PoW was ""One-CPU-One-Vote"", which is CLEARLY stated to be the opposite of one person acquiring more power than another.

It also states that this method allows for fair distribution, as there is no central authority of issuance. Today, there is effectively a central authority, Jihan.

In White Paper, regarding 51% Hash Attack, it states that this would 'invalidate their source of wealth'. This is no longer true today either, as there are many alternative cryptos, such as Bcash. Destroying Bitcoin would not destroy Bcash, thus it would not invalidate their source of wealth.

In White Paper, it STRONGLY warns against anyone group acquiring over 10% of the Hashing Paper. It sets a boundary of 10% as concerning, and 30% as intolerable. Today Jihan has a very significant amount.

In White Paper, it suggests 99.9% accuracy should be the standard. It then says that with 45% Hash Concentration, this can only be obtained after 2 and half days of processing as opposed to 1 hour, with a maximum of 10% concentration.

For those that are unaware, there is no possibility of getting 99.9% accuracy after 51% Hash Concentration. After 51% Hash Concentration, effectively other Nodes become irrelevant.

It has a ""brand awareness"" as it were, even though obviously it is not a company or own stock or shareholders or whatever.

"Try wiring different currencies. One of the banks will convert it at a rate depending on how much you're wiring, but guaranteed worse than when you naively look up the fx rate (spot rate).

In that case, it's better to convert currency 1 to BTC, transfer that, then convert BTC to currency 2 at the receiving bank. I've done this and it's shaved several % off the cost, which adds up quickly of course.

To use what you said as an example, yes, not every business required confirmations on Bitcoin deposits in 2012. You have now remembered this as ""sellers didn't need to check confirmations"" instead of ""sellers didn't bother to check for confirmations"". By the end of 2013 (long before blocks were full) almost no such businesses remained. The reason? It became more and more common knowledge how to exploit this naivety to steal.

BTC - still the household name and all the bragging about „too oldfashioned“ are crap in my eyes. BTC will adopt to new challenges slowly and be an important player for a long time.

OMG - „Banking the unbanked“ is a huge market imho and the OMG-team seems to adjust to that task remarkably well.

CARDANO - but NOT at the current price. Overvalued, yes, but there is a reason for that. IF they deliver as they promise, this will be a really good one.

NAS (Nebulas) - a project under the radar. The team sets itself very ambitious deadlines and is meeting them all so far. Lowest carket-cap in my Top-5 and thus plenty of room to grow. Probably best risk/reward in my list.

The more it goes up the less likely current holders are to sell. Everyone watching Bitcoin knows its low. There's a few short sellers but they are getting less and less convinced as you can see by the slow down in downwards momentum. And in fact Friday there was a big short cover as you can see by the jump. 

So now as we start hitting the levels going up more and more people are going to cover driving the price up and less and less will be selling, they'll be holding out for higher prices. 

And we have the next leg up. And the historically it will be maybe 1000%, maybe 2000% up. I think you'll find sellers thin on the ground once it's confirmed we've turned. I think that will be at $12 000",1523179294

"Regarding the zebi coin,  i couldn't find any info of contract with a state government. Please share that because India just banned buying /selling of crypto so it's hard for me to believe that state govt.  is interested in it. 

The team looks fucking great though. ",1523179257
"Bitcoin full node software is actually not crazy resource heavy and syncs up pretty fast despite the long history of the bitcoin blockchain.

If you're talking about PoW then yes it uses lots of electricity to secure the network atm since hashrate are follows the price like for all PoW backed blockchains. Which is great because it also means it's very expensive to attack.

Regarding transaction approval time im not sure if you mean rhe average block time (10mn) or if you mean average confirmation time of a tx (which right now since low usage/fees usually confirms in 1 block).

Regarding the block time, 10mn gives you good trade off between security and orphan rate. Shorter like litecoin chose to do (2.5mn) means each confirmation has less finality and orphan rates are higher (means in the end greater mining centralisation).

In short the block time is IMO fine as it is and guarantees a quite strong finality on first confirmation. Shorter block times comes with trade offs that would risk making the chain  less secure and censorship resistant. 

I'm not aware of any BIPs that involve changing the block time but if it's backed by strong evidence it wouldn't affect the chain negatively I'd love to see one (although since it will need a hard fork/ won't be backwards compatible I doubt it would have a chance to be adopted).",1523179216

"The reason it holds value is because of its monetary protocol that makes bitcoin hard money. There is a finite quantity of bitcoins and the market cannot be dumped with an influx of Bitcoins as the demand rises, since miners can only mine a fixed amount of Bitcoin with ever increasing difficulty. This is what makes Bitcoin the perfect store of value. Similarly to gold.",1523178966
How can the BTC community support Blockstream?,1523178951
"Because he used to be pro-BTC back when he registered the handle.

Then, like every other person in this sub, we realized BTC had been hijacked and created a fork, BCH, to continue the original direction of bitcoin.

He still owns @bitcoin after that event, so he's using it to express that viewpoint.

How is that so hard to understand? It's the same reason Bitcoin.com is pro-BCH too.",1523178935
"Just the opposite. By every single measure in [the actual document that defines the term ""Bitcoin""](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is already more ""Bitcoin"" than BTC. No more so than in the very title, where BCH is committed to being ""A Peer-to-Peer Electronic **Cash** System"" while BTC is actively moving towards becoming a high fee, high friction store-of-value system.  

That same paper also clearly laid out the Sybil-resistant consensus system by which Bitcoin should evolve. Almost all of the recent, major changes to BTC were achieved by actively subverting this Nakamoto consensus via every unethical means available (UASF anyone?) This may be most obvious in that SegWit is now activated on the BTC chain *without the promised 2x increase part of the consensus agreement*. **This means SegWit activated on BTC illegitimately**.  

It was this exact ""SegWit2x' charade of a consensus agreement that ultimately forced the on-chain scaling contingent of the community to fork the block chain as a hash rate minority before SegWit polluted the original Bitcoin block chain forever, as we all clearly knew that 2x was an empty promise that would never take place. Now that the Rube Goldbergian, security-sapping complexity of SegWit has sullied the BTC block chain, the only measure left to establish that BCH is the real Bitcoin is the most total aggregate proof of SHA256 work (since it already owns the ""longest chain"" measure specified in the white paper). If BCH market capitalization overtakes that of BTC for any significant period, it will have this characteristic as well. When and if this will occur remains to be seen, but every day demonstrates that one system works and is consistently honest and reliable, while the other continues to be mired in unreliability related to congestion and fee uncertainty, its own unnecessary complexity, and its community leaders' innate duplicity.

"This is a classic quote from GMAX

I think it's quite unfortunately, but especially since Roger's involved in a pretty acrimonious lawsuit with some other members of the community **it seems unlikely to me that he can appear in the press without someone blasting the press with ""you know that dudes a fellon, right?""**  Sad

I have read most of his posts and whilst some of them have made me cringe from time to time, overall he makes sense and I think had the right idea about scaling and creating a fee market.

And the only reason why it’s not called just “Bitcoin” is for the reason you mentioned. That’s why it’s called “Bitcoin Cash”. Ethereum and Ethereum Classic don’t have this problem.

But look, he's been VERY confrontational and talkative, and his papers DO have problems. Nothing said in that regard was wrong, *nothing*. It backfired. Also, the lack of decent proof of him being part of satoshi + he talking right and left how people are writing cancer and that he will do this and that and public dozens of papers looks very bad and charlatanism.

Let it be (yet another) example of how not to proceed with scientific debate in crypto.

Just like most other top 50 tokens except it's better than a lot of them since it is no ico/premine. Crypto has it's problems. You really think this is the first time a crypto has been exploited in this manner before where someone could mine a ton of the token really fast? It's not.

This shit will happen from time to time, it gets fixed and we all move towards the future. It's just outright FUD and LIES to compare Verge to Bitconnect. One is as legitimate as Bitcoin. The other was a Ponzi scheme. Kinda hard to say Verge is  ponzi scheme when it shows none of the traditional flags of being a ponzi scheme.

If blocks keep being 50 kB it doesn't matter if the max is 1 MB or 32 MB, they will still be just 50 kB. The only difference is that when needed in 1 or 5 years the extra bytes are there.

Spam won't be a problem either since at 1 satoshi per byte you'd have to pay 32000000 satoshis (0.32 BCH) every ~10 minutes to fill up each block. That's ~46.08 BCH per day. Plus if the attacker have just 1 satoshi per byte like all other legit transactions they are just as likely to be included in the blocks as the spam transactions, so realistically you'd have to use a fee of at least 2 satoshi per byte to create a somewhat effective denial of service (~92.16 BCH per day).",1523175314

"&gt;- Which blockchain has the widest distribution of programmers with the longest track record?

Valid.
&gt;- Which blockchain is already known by most westerners?

Not that relevant in my opinion.
&gt;- Which blockchain has the best ideas and brains for coping with evolving use cases (such as scaling solutions)?

This most likely isn't Bitcoin.      
&gt;- Which blockchain has established a set of clear, transparent procedures for peer review and has proven most resilient to hostile takeovers?       

1) Almost all of them.      
2) Most resilient is hard to say, as very few have actually had any even remotely successful hostile takeovers, but yes, Bitcoin will be up there.    

&gt;- Which is the only blockchain supported by the very inventors behind the key technologies that were required for all of this to happen?

"I don’t know the whole truth on what you’ve said I can only go on the uk tax perspective, but I agree 100% with your figuring and I cannot see if you did any of those how they could prove otherwise.

Capital gains allowance in in U.K. is just over 11k, anything above is 20% tax minus cost of the original BTC and miner fees ect, not difficult to calculate and pay.

Trading though is grey done on a case by case scenario, if you prove your a hobbies speculator there is no tax payable, as it’s akin to gambling.

Buying other coins I believe is a taxable event, but even if those coins go up the tax should be 20 % when you cash out.
If you don’t cash out and the coins go down below what you paid you can have the loss, carried into any gains.

Personally I know all is recorded it is traceable, but it’s a massive job, believe me they are relaying on people being honest and reporting their gains.

I’m self employed in the U.K. and I can off set a lot of things against my final tax bill,there are also countries where no tax is payable, it’s having accounts in those countries though for that purpose.
Or go on Holliday and change crypto in countries that have tax free policy.

“Because I’m bored.... tell me why I’m wrong about my opinions on the following top 25’ish coins:

BCH, LTC, NANO, BTG: Four coins (which are also competing with an unknown number of other coins with the same value proposition that aren’t in the top 25) all competing for, at most, one spot. All of these coins can’t and won’t be used. Mass adoption of P2P will boil down to one winner. NANO seems to have the best tech, and the worst marketing/market position currently.

BTC: the above doesn’t even mention Bitcoin, which could knock out all of the previous mentioned coins.

XRP/XLM: People love XLM and hate XRP. They are literally the same coin with a different name. Apparently Ripple’s protocol/potential use case doesn’t really need the coin. XLM has an IBM partnership that hasn’t been fleshed out completely, and FairX exchange which has been teasing some super secret revelation lately. I don’t really have an opinion on the future of either. **Correction:  XLM is an ICO and smart contracts platform.**

EOS/ADA: huge market caps for coins with no real products. Thoughts continued in the next category. **Correction: you can send and receive value with ADA. However, it doesn’t begin to deliver on its core promises related to smart-contracts**

ETH/NEO: Apparently 70% of dApps are games. This isn’t world changing. It’s yet to be seen whether any world changing applications actually need DLT. Remember, changing the world doesn’t just require creating an app that is better than the status quo, it also requires convincing the public to use it. Just an example, how does REQ convince the public to switch away from Venmo or PayPal?

Monero/Verge: Same problems as LTC/BTC/NANO/BCH, and then add regulatory issues governments will have with privacy coins.

IOTA: Technical issues to be solved, such as getting a high enough transactions per second to remove the coordinator, is the cryptography actually secure etc.

DASH: I literally never see anyone mention DASH, yet it’s consistently on the top 15. I know nothing about it honestly, and I follow crypto forums relatively closely.

I know I haven’t covered them all. I don’t know enough about the rest to have an opinion. TRX seems scammy. Who is developing ETC, and what future does it have? VEN seems to have a lot of big news that may or may not be over-hyped. I still don’t know what XEM does.

Anyways... not trying to FUD any coin, I’m just bored watching a movie with my wife. Downvote if you want, but I’d rather you tell me how I’m wrong (or right). This thread is supposed to be for discussion, right? 

**Correction: no longer watching a movie with my wife. I just expected further pushback on my thoughts on crypto’s largest projects, and hope that someone can point out how I’m wrong. Otherwise, maybe our bubble has burst (deservedly) and we’re in for a long, dark road**",1523170838
"You may be missing the significance though, ILP is providing a standardized and universal framework specifically meant to connect other ledgers together. By virtue of this, XRP and all other crypto that run on ILP enabled block-chains will benefit.  ",1523170828
