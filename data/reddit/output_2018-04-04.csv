"I agree, it is annoying that all coins are dependent on Bitcoin's price.

"Are there any games involving crypto? Like where you find or collect crypto?
Furthermore are there any apps that heavily gamify the crypto experience?",1522910791
"That's a small problem that bitcoin has, but it illustrates the bigger problem of coins being lost forever. People die prematurely without wills all the time, so there is a very high potential that coins will continually be removed from circulation. Which leads to the main problem, deflation is not a good model for a currency and hosts a ton of problems for the broader economic landscape. ",1522910705
"I was going to file all as a business but was told by the tax official that in Japan, since its a self reporting system, its up to the tax payer to determine their ""desire"" in pursuing as a business.

For 2018 I filed the gains and expenses as 雑収入 aka Misc. Income, so not a business expense.  I did that because I didn't earn enough for it to look like I was pursuing it as a main job and the tax rate is better for misc income.

The reason I did CT as a business expense is because I took it as software needed to help calculate my business taxes now and in the future.  Whether I end up filing crypto gains as business in the future is another thing....",1522910702
"Existence of altcoins is not the same as falling more than half in marketcap, is it?


whatever...

Dude I get it, you hate BCH and you love BTC, I just don't understand why you waste time countering everything and defending these people. Do you think that the market gives a shit to what sansung mongrol says? Do you think that BCH having bitcoin in the same will do the flippening? I can't understand what you people think you gain trolling the subreddit, you certainly do not increase the price of bitcoin core.",1522910653
"Volatility isn't getting any better though, so how can the store of value aspect be improved?

It all seems like trying to create a self fulfilling prophecy: If people strongly believe in hodling and SoV, BTC will eventually become one. But why should BTC be able to take that role, and no other coin?

Furthering adoption seems a much safer and more objective approach than trying to preach a believe system.

"How can you complain that Bitcoin is used for money making when your original complaint is that your coins went down because Bitcoin went down?

Consider that Bitcoin doesn't have to make you rich to be useful.",1522910631
We're on death cross territory. Btc has had 3 death crosses. Out of the 3 only 1 would've cost you money if u bought btc when it crossed the MACD. The other 2 btc rallied shortly after crossing.,1522910597
"Log charts are the only charts that make sense when talking about change in values over time and are preferred in pretty much every scientific field for this kind of data (including the softer sciences like economics).

If I have *x* amount of bitcoin, and it doubles, then it'll be twice as high on the chart.  If I have *y* amount and it doubles, then it'll be twice as high on the chart.  If I have *z* amount and it halves, then it'll be half the height on the chart.  Log charts show *real* changes in value.

Linear charts on the other hand show some arbitrary figure that can be manipulated at will to show misleading information.  Let's imagine a simple case of 10 satoshi is the same value as 1 McDonalds hamburger.  
If I have 20 satoshi, I can buy 2 hamburgers.  If you have 100 satoshi, you can buy 10 hamburgers.  If the value doubles, then on a logarithmic chart, we can both see that our values (in terms of hamburgers) is twice as much.  My line will be at exactly 4 hamburgers and yours will be at 20 hamburgers.

Compare this to a linear chart.  On the linear chart, your line went up 160 units higher than mine (mine went to 40 and yours went to 200), making you appear to have done 80 times as well out of it than I have.  This can easily shown to be arbitrary manipulation since you can change these apparent values just by introducing different units.  Instead of satoshi, we could measure in µBTC.  In µBTC, I went from 0.2 to 0.4 and you went from 1 to 2.  Looking at it that way, you only did 0.8 better than me.  In reality however, we both did equally as well - doubling our value.   
 If it's still not clear, do the same thought experiment with dollars and cents.  Me going from 200 cents to 400 cents and you going from 1000 cents to 2000 cents.  Whether you choose to call those values $2, $4, $10 and $20 is irrelevant - the meaning is the same.  Simply put: directly convertible units are meaningless and only percentage change can be used for anything meaningful.

^((note: do not spend all your BTC on hamburgers.  If you die young of heart disease and poor due to having no BTC left, you miss out on all the fun of being a curmudgeonly old man like me who can tell people to get off his oversized lawn)^)",1522910594

"&gt; Oh yes I know, since your pro-BCH account was sold to a shill army 

When? When do you think this happened? If I drastically changed my view at some point you should be able to point to at least a rough period on time when that happened? But you can’t because it never did happen.

In fact here’s how ridiculously dumb this accusation is: I actually *was* “anti-BCH” at the time the fork happened. I thought, and said repeatedly, that the ABC fork was a massively rushed idea that seriously undermined the original SegWit2x plan. I also said it would likely provide the Blockstream guys with yet more ammunition against hardforks in general by being a gigantic clusterfuck that people pushed through in a matter of weeks.

I still think all of the above is true, and I’d be really curious to peak into the alternate universe where the ABC fork never happened and see if the SegWit2x hardfork went ahead. 

*But* besides all that, my views on BCH have become much more positive over time. In nominal terms I owned substantially more BCH than BTC, and substantially more than I received at the time of the fork. I think it’s good to have a big-block version of Bitcoin running in the wild.

So as I’ve said a million times now. **I’m not anti-BCH. I’m against fraudulent conmen shitbags like Craig Wright and the army of sock-puppets they send to massage their appearance on social media**.",1522910252

"Hahaha alright friend. You seem to have a pretty confident view of me.

I really just don't give a shit. I will say, by bullshit I was specifically referring to the claim that Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin, and BTC is ""soon to be less 'Bitcoin' than ever."" I just really don't think that kind of content should be in a PSA kind of post like this. Even if BCH does follow the whitepaper more closely and is ideologically Bitcoin, it causes confusion for new users who could buy the other coin by accident and pisses off people who disagree. Claiming the name of another coin which is widely accepting across the market just isn't gonna work well regardless of the truth. And ""soon to be less 'Bitcoin' than ever,"" I don't really know what you mean specifically and although I could be missing something it reads a like a completely unevidenced opinion.

 If you don't see my point than I just hope you think about it more over time.

&gt; it is probably healthier for you to take a break

I genuinely appreciate the thought but it is very much not necessary. 

I probably won't reply again unless you say something really interesting, but I really hope you manage to at least get something out of what I'm trying to say. ",1522909752
"I personally don't think we will go back to what happened in December. I think crypto is going towards its next phase, which is that only coins that prove their worth will survive and grow in value, coins that cant won't die perse, but it wont regain its ATH value.

"It’s more complicated than I thought. I think initially I had in mind the situation where the coins were premined. Then there could be a steady loss in the quantity of Bitcoin as measured by bitcoin not say Satoshi becasue of the divisibility. However I also overlooked that at any time, and assuming bitcoin indefinitely divisable, total loss could be averted by redistributing small amounts of of bitcoin to new addresses. Having multiple addresses prevents the total loss I had in mind.",1522909633
"There is a huge difference between fees being designed to be low vs ""just happened to be low because usage is down"".  BCH fees will always be low no matter how much usage it gets because when or if blocks get near filling up, the blocksize will be increased because that is a core value of Bitcoin Cash.

BTC tx fees will go right back to $10 as soon as usage picks up and there is a backlog.  BTC fees rise at precisely the correct rate to kill any adoption that causes usage to go up.",1522909577

Maybe it'll drop down further and not come back. I personally don't think that will be the case but the point is that ""going to zero"" is not the primary fear of investors.

Third, this opinion is controversial, but BTC is probably the most over-inflated coin in the top five. I'd probably move assets to ETH and Ripple, or spread them evenly across the top 5 or 10 currencies. That said, they're probably all going to go down for a while longer (how long &amp; how far? Nobody knows.)

Fourth, I would avoid holding assets in Tether for more than a few hours at a time. Tether is basically operating as a wildcat bank. They claim that they have $1 in an account somewhere backing every single USDT in existence (over $2B worth, presently), but you basically have to trust them.

"&gt; Gold isn't money. Uh huh.

Actually, gold isn't money by its own virtue of being gold. Only gold that was actually used in the manufacture of money (by being pressed into coins) was money. However the difference between gold and money is that gold has intrinsic value, so even gold that was never minted into coins would still have value. The same could be said for the penny, if pennies were still manufactured out of pure copper. The value of gold and copper increase over time because there is a finite amount of each in the world. This makes commodities great for saving, but not great for investing.

Fiat money and gold money are both money because they are minted. Money has nothing to do with the intrinsic value of the medium on which that money is manufactured (paper for US Dollars, electronic storage for Bitcoin). It only has extrinsic value, propped up by the market in which it is traded. Generally currencies are inflationary (meaning they lose value over time), so they are good instruments for investing.

And herein lies the issue with cryptocurrencies. In many ways they have inherited the worst attributes of both fiat currency and commodity.  It takes a tremendous amount of energy to create one unit of cryptocurrency, and they are constrained in future growth (making them deflationary), but they have no intrinsic value. A bitcoin cannot be used to make jewelry, or electronics, or really anything else. It is merely a number at the end of a long calculation. The only value a Bitcoin has is the value the market places on it. At the same time, it's usefulness as a currency is limited because deflation constrains investment (investment in this sense is Capital investment - manufacturing, capital projects, doing things that actually *creates* value). ",1522907461

I am still learning a lot about op code and all the benefits and possible risks but in general the most useful use case as the moment is to allow for a small little bit of extra arbitrary data in the blockchain that can be used for tokens. This will give Bitcoin Cash a bit of the functionality that Ethereum also offers.   Cryptonize.it for instance I think is planning to use these tokens for a kind of reward system. So there will be immediately be some extra usage possible that will find users. Making Bitcoin Cash more attractive to developers and investors and hopefully leading to increased tx on the blockchain. Tx on the blockchain although not a super reliable metric (cause one party could make 50% of the tx and you would have to do some investigation to figure that out) is one of few we have that tell us a bit about adoption. ,1522903750
"&gt; Craig Wright claimed to be Satoshi. He 'proved' it to someone privately who then said they were convinced.

That's the point, he didn't prove shit to the public. Yet he gets treated by some as if he was legit. He's not.

My example was of course, on the extreme side of things, and you should've gotten what I meant, but you didn't. So I'll try one last time:

extraordinary claims, require extraordinary evidence.

If you are going to claim to be the inventor of Bitcoin, you better have some compelling evidence if you want to be taken seriously. This guy has not  done that. But he seems to be a damn good conman, since people like you are willing to give him the benefit of doubt.

You're welcome to do that of course, but it's wrong. And you shouldn't be surprised to see very healthy pushback to con artists.

So I don't think you even understand what illogical means, if you're willing to accept an extraordinary claim like ""I convinced this person in private!"" It's stupid. Just like the people that believe in prophets because someone says god spoke to them (in private, with no one else around of course!) and he now knows what god wants.

Crypto is full with Crypto Nicks who are extremely amateur business wise.  ",1522903543

"&gt;No consensus is not the reason for the 1mb limit.
Protecting bitcoin against DDoS during its early days was the reason for the limit.
It was implemented later and was never meant to be a permanent economic feature.

True,  and consensus decided to retain that feature, for now.

&gt; You are just arguing semantics here

No, that's just how bitcoin works, by consensus.

&gt;If tomorrow Miner decided to soft fork BTC to limit it to one transactions per block don’t you agree it will be a radical change?
Yet it is a soft fork? No consensus rule broken, yet the currency is unusable, how do you explain that?

That's the precise reason nodes matter. Such a soft fork could be ignored by **you** if **your** node rejects such a change. The idiots who dominate this thread would have you believe otherwise, but actual peers who run nodes in this peers to peer system decide what blocks conform to the rules they want. 

Get over it. You've been scammed by big blockers telling you bitcoin is whatever a minority wants it to be.

But Derek Magill has an excellent article explaining how its not possible: ""The fact is that the good things about Bitcoin Cash are inseparably bound up with the bad things about Bitcoin Core.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/846fje/people_say_that_we_should_stop_focusing_on/)",1522903178
"&gt;This coming out of a /r/Bitcoin ""mod"" is HILARIOUS.

Putting ""mod"" in quotes doesn't make any sense; I am a moderator of the subreddit, the quotes aren't necessary. Also, it's pretty clear that /r/Bitcoin has far more honest, valuable, and relevant information available than this place does; our moderation policies have apparently had an extremely positive effect, if you contrast the two subreddits and attribute the differences to the moderation (at least in part). This subreddit is run by a proven liar and moderators who are willing to remove posts that don't even violate any subreddit rules (by marking them as ""spam"" no matter how obviously-not-spam they are)... but in any case, what you find ""HILARIOUS"" is your business.

&gt;As before, if you want to prove a point, stick to the point

I did.

&gt;and don't direct people to read 30 pages of nonsense.

If you want proof that Roger Ver is a liar, 30 pages of proven examples of him lying (or as you put it, spreading ""nonsense"") does the trick.

Again, you don't have to read the facts if you don't want to, but they're there if you change your mind and want to know more.

&gt;The rest of your post isn't even worth my time to read. 

Sure, that's a fairly standard reply when someone is not able to actually form a meaningful response to what you've said.

&gt;Come back when you actually have a valid argument you can lay out succinctly.

Here you go: ""Roger Ver is a [proven](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/87t3ot/comment/dwh4n51) liar."" That should be succinct enough for you, and the validity is included within.

That even suggesting he is Satoshi without following through an providing evidence could give him a platform doesn't make it less believable but more believable -- he can gain a platform without painting a target on his back. It doesn't hurt that possibility at all. 

But I digress, 

The interesting part is not whether or not he is Satoshi, as we have no information about that, but rather whether the things he says has any merit.

But first you will have to add lots of praise and feel good news to it or you will get banned for damaging true about the holy one",1522902345
"Dude people already have used binance to buy Bitconnect and lost tons of money on it. People buy into lots of stuff I believe extremely strongly will fail and lose people money.

The crypto space doesn't exist as a display case. Binance's job isn't to make everyone money. It's to show you the crypto marketplace. There are shitloads of scam coins and doomed projects in the crypto space. It's a market. There are shitty companies that trade on wall street, there are companies with people embezzling money or committing active fraud that we don't know about yet. There are companies that are doomed to fail that might be hiding it.

Pretending like we don't have those same issues will probably lead to more people getting scammed in the crypto space than anything. Awareness is important. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.

Especially in a difficult-to-understand space, understanding what your coins can actually do when you buy some, and why they're worth what they're worth, is important. Also I'm assuming random people getting into crypto aren't going to buy a random low volume shitcoin, they'd just buy bitcoin or eth. Or honestly lots of non crypto normal people I know have heard about ripple and they buy that...

I have a ex army vet friend who literally went all in, put like, $10,000, his like life savings into ripple... I don't know how, math wise, he expects the market cap to really go beyond like $2-3 optimistically... Even when it was in it's boom like, these crazy ripple people are talking about how they think Ripple could be $10 by the end of the year... With only like 1/4th of the supply even in circulation... The company is literally trying to price control their own currency by holding billions of it in, only 39b is deployed, they're holding the other 62b. I actually think ripple has a ton of utility and huge potential as a crypto. But the problem is just that you have an inflationary coin, not a deflationary one. At least in the immediate future. Realistically, you know that in the long term just on volume, your coin is not worth as much. Those open releases of ripple / sales are specifically to allow strategic partners that would use ripple to be able to buy in at a stronger position than the public.

But back to the example. For people that aren't doing their research. They're going to get destroyed, or at least get their expectations shattered. All you can do is urge people to research the space, you can't blame yourself, or anyone else when someone willingly chooses to do something stupid.",1522902335
What I want to know is when the government is going to address bitcoin?,1522902278
"&gt; So why they decided to ban ads related to ICO’s?

Because it's a hot subject. Because it's in the media and good part of it is ""against"" the crypto-agenda. Because the SEC is going hard on ICOs and if you're the owner of one of these companies you probably don't want to get mixed up on this shit storm. Because probably a government institution ""asked"" for them to ban these ads. There are really many possible answers.",1522902259

The only mentions of ""56%"" and/or ""datacenters"" in the actual paper are in the following two excerpts (quoted verbatim from the paper):

&gt;This geographic proximity between nodes, along with the observation that Bitcoin has many nodes with 100 Mbps of provisioned bandwidth (see Section 4.1), seems to indicate that many Bitcoin nodes are run in datacenters. 56% of Bitcoin's nodes and 28% of Ethereum's nodes belong to an autonomous system that provides dedicated hosting services, a difference significant at the 1% significance level.

And...

&gt;Our observations show that Bitcoin has a higher capacity network than Ethereum, but with more clustered nodes likely in datacenters.

Both of these statements include indications that the ""run in datacenters"" conclusion was a result of the latency and bandwidth analysis, and both are phrased with ""seems to indicate"" and ""likely"" clauses, rather than phrases that indicate *certainty* like what you're trying to claim here. 

Neither the paper nor your blog post about it make any mention of DNS lookups, and if that was actually the information that led you to your conclusion, the glaring omission of it from the paper (and the subsequent statements you've made regarding it) is... *extremely odd*, to say the least.

Why don't you go ahead and publish the reverse DNS lookup results for peer review, if that's where the ""56% of Bitcoin nodes are run from datacenters"" claim stems from?

It seems like you made this up, contrasting the actual paper's content against your statement here. The month-long delay between when I made my comment and when you responded stands out here, too... but I'm willing to take a look at this DNS-related data (and try to independently verify the ""56%"" figure myself) as soon as you make it available.",1522901753

"&gt; 1. The most likely is that BTC/BCH would be sold for JPY and then taxes deducted (multiple times) before I would ever see any of these. Because of the taxation issue it's likely a sale would be required in order for the value to be stable in JPY.

I apologize if you had already clarified in previous comments and I’d missed.
But, my question is, if the court decides to sell the remaining 160k BTC and remaining BCH for fiat, do you know if they will sell it on exchange?
The amounts that have been sold thus far for creditors have collapsed the crypto market and impeded the progress of crypto and widespread implementation of blockchain technology as it burnt many new investors who came in late 2017.
Would you know how they would normally sell remaining assets in Japan in bankruptcy cases? If you have a choice, please sell them off exchange!

**No, not at all.** I am pointing out that Roger Ver has a long history of lying, and I have linked you to *dozens* of examples of him doing so. Then you refused to read the many examples provided, which clearly show a **pattern of dishonesty**, and demanded for me to pick a *single* example of a lie from the list. Now that I've done so, you balk and say ""You want to attack Roger *simply because he made a single contradictory comment*?""

That's absurd on a number of levels. I don't ""want to attack"" anyone, I would just like for the truth to be known. When I see people like Roger (or you) go out of their way to spread falsehoods and disinformation, and engage in extremely deceptive tactics, *exactly like what you just tried to do here*, I try to make sure that this is highlighted, so that bad actors can be clearly identified as such.

&gt;Sorry, that doesn't seem to be relevant to the vast array of fraud accusations made against Roger daily

It is perfectly relevant, because it is an undeniable example of him lying, and again, *that's not the only example that you were provided*. If that were the *only* example we had of Roger lying, that would be one thing... when it's part of a long list (as we can see that it is), that's another entirely.

&gt;I think if the average person, myself included, were subjected to such scrutiny, there would be a lie somewhere there too

Yes, I've read multiple comments of yours where you *did* lie or go extremely far out of your way to misrepresent a subject, and I've methodically debunked your attempts to do so on numerous occasions. Rather than admitting your mistakes or conceding the points, you invariably ""try to fight back"" and defend yourself (or in some cases refuse to respond altogether), so you are correct: if we scrutinize your own comments, *you deliberately deceive as well*. You might want to convince yourself that this is ""normal"" behavior, but it's really not. Honesty is totally possible, and many of us live our lives telling the truth (and admitting, and apologizing for, the rare occasions when we were wrong).

&gt;For all you know, that might not have even been an outright lie.

That is definitionally impossible. The two statements directly contradict one another; one of them *had* to be a lie.

&gt;That's not much money

The quantity of money involved doesn't make a lie into a truth.

&gt;his organizations and finances are large and complicated

The inner workings of his ""organizations and finances"" do not make a lie into a truth.

&gt;He undoubtedly has people he trusts that manage at least a portion of his coins, he might have directed someone to trade some hot wallet trading funds from BTC to BCH but never moved any cold storage funds himself to do such a trade, making both statements true in different ways.

Not only could he have mentioned something like this when he was called out for the lie originally (and he did not, instead opting for the ridiculous ""futures"" gimmick that I already linked you to the explanation and refutation of), but even if your own wriggle-attempt was followed, it *doesn't* ""make both statements true in different ways"", it makes the latter statement false and a lie.

&gt;But it doesn't even matter.

A high-profile person being a habitual and unapologetic liar does matter, for the reasons you outlined in your very first top-level comment in this thread.

&gt;It's a small percentage

That doesn't make a lie into a truth.

&gt;and a small time period

Not only does this fail to make a lie into a truth, but it actually makes it *worse*. He is contradicting himself within days (or sometimes hours). That's a *bad* sign, and shows just how regularly he is trying to deceive others.

&gt;and both statements are logically consistent with both his long term views

Both statements contradict one another, so they are not ""logically consistent"" in any sense and definitionally are logically inconsistent.

&gt;I could pick apart the second ""string of lies""

I'm sure that you could spin your wheels very hard in the desperate effort to pretend like lies are not lies. You've shown this very well already. If you'd like to try, be my guest... there's a long list available for you to go through.

&gt;Surely this isn't the best you have to demonstrate that Ver isn't trustworthy or is a fraud?

You guys have a zero fee coin built on a brilliant concept which could solve these issues, but your complaining that a competing coin isn’t solving them.

Bitcoin practically took a year spent in defense because some people were greedy and wanted features ‘now’ instead of waiting.  Bitcoin is built specifically with a way to add features/update software using consensus.  You would probably argue that the core team spread misinformation and censorship to stop your ‘side’ from achieving consensus, but the fact remains that regardless how many arguments people have for who follows the white paper more closely, btc literally is bitcoin because it followed the consensus trail and at a hard fork has higher hash rate.  But even then, they’ve spent the better part of a year arguing/defending against splits instead of being able to address the actual issues.  I fully believe that if it weren’t for Bitcoin Cash split, and the threatened 2x split, we would have already had a blocksize increase in addition to segwit and ln tweaks.

Bitcoin can’t serve all purposes at all times and do it immediately, and you blaming developers for choosing the wrong priorities and causing people to die are seriously just spreading hate and fear.  You obviously have no experience how software development goes, because if you did, you would realize that rushing software is what actually, actively gets people killed by failing at critical points.  The fact that bitcoin couldn’t ‘save’ those lives because it wasn’t ready in time may be objectively true, but for you to suggest that he was laughing because he doesn’t care the people died, as opposed to laughing at the ridiculousness of Ver suddenly cares about people 1/100th as much as he actually care about all the money he’s lost because people didn’t do what he wanted, when he wanted is either naive or disingenuous.

How do you think coins get on exchanges? Binance, Kucoin, etc all charge to get listings. Buried at the bottom of that same article, saying that it's common to pay 1-3 million for listings. Makes Ripple offering 1 million seem not that odd, and it's definitely not a bribe or **every** other cryptocurrency listed on KuCoin and most if not all listed on Binance are guilty of bribery as well.

&gt;It’s not necessarily unusual to pay for a cryptocurrency listing. Costs range from $1 million “for a reasonably regarded token, to $3 million for an opportunity to get quick liquidity,” according to a report from Autonomous Research, which added that the figures are based on conversations among market participants and aren’t exact.

Unless you're laughing at them being denied, in which case I would say Ripple has gotten XRP on 60+ exchanges and the majority of its trading volume goes through fiat pairs already despite not being on Gemini or Coinbase.

"Honestly I think a ‘second layer’ is necessary, but i don’t know that it has to be something as obvious as LN. I think it’s possible that some of the things that make it secure enough to be a great currency (any crypto, in general, i mean) have a downside of making it harder to use directly.  There are trade offs every single time you use a bitcoin based crypto that you have ‘exposed’ your private key, even if only very slightly.  Most regular users are already implementing a second layer ‘kind’ of system themselves simply by using a hot/cold wallet, multiple addresses, etc to limit the liability they know is implicit in the technology, so I’m not entirely convinced that a publicly acknowledged ‘second layer’ is an objectively bad thing.  I do believe that for mass adoption, some type of second layer will naturally occur, even if it’s an app they’re trusting, or a card linked to their bitcoin wallet.  I could honestly see a couple ways lightning could fill the role, or it’s a layer someone else builds on and consumers don’t even know that the lightning layer exists.  As long as it’s possible to exchange bitcoin exactly like it is now, i don’t think it will hurt if there are other ways to do it as well...ways that sacrifice some of the features of bitcoin for convenience or speed, as long as the underlying decentralization and trustless nature of bitcoin itself stays intact, it should be usable in a thousand different ways for different use cases and I’m just fine with it.

This goes for Bitcoin/Bitcoin Cash/any blockchain crypto...it’s strength is it’s decentralized nature and algorithm...but almost no one is going to use it in it’s raw, native form. Even a wallet is halfway towards being a second layer (not really, but close), a phone app or an exchange, or anything like that, really, is there to provide some convenience at the expense of giving up one or more strengths.",1522897891

https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf

I don't really think it matters what you believe. The blockchain is downloaded and you can verify it by hashing the results of each block yourself to make sure each sequential block hashes with the right number of nonces.  So I don't know what you mean by the nodes do nothing with it...they calculate the hashes of each block. They don't DO anything beyond that...

There are always stolen coins. I hack into your computer and  get your private key and move your coins. Those are stolen coins right? Those coins will exist in the official blockchain. It happens all the time. The state of Alabama is under cyber attack right now with cryptolocker type attacks telling them to pay bitcoins into some account. That's on the chain too. Mt Gox got robbed...that's on our chain. That doesn't make the chain itself insecure.

You don't have control over anything if you run a node. Don't you understand? A bank needs control over bank accounts since they are the ones that process all transactions. If you want to withdraw money from an ATM, your ATM communicates with the bank's servers to determine if you have enough money in your account and whether to authorize the ATM to spit out some bills, and then your bank updates its records to reduce the amount in your account.

A full node cannot do this.

A miner can.

Their customer service is absolutely horrible. They give no explanation on what's going on with the miners you bought and own.

&gt;Sorry to mess up this thread and topic a bit, but after i do not get for hours an answer on twitter, neither does the email function on the Verge homepage work, nor does someone respond on the Verge Bitcoin thread i have to try my luck here.

&gt;I visited some hours ago the official Verge Twitter profil to read the news about the hash hack. While reading the tweed i noticed several messages offering a compensation for the attack by Verge. Send x Eth and you get some bonus back. Sounded legit to me as it was affilated to the hash attack and i suffered from it as well having had some hours only orphaned blocks on all my baikals, hence i fall victim to this damn scam on the official twitter page.

&gt;Now, while i have myself for sure some vault for this i'am seriously angry about how on the official verge twitter page 100s of scams and fake messages that say they got the ETH back are tolerated and nobody cares about it?!?! How is this possible. After i realized i got scammed i even made a post in this tweet that its a scam and to remove it asap, nothing happened and people still fall after that scam. Only on that scam by now 12+ Eth have been transfered the last hours. 

&gt;Damn, i'am not a twitter guy and very rarely use it, but from an official Verge twitter profil i personal await its clean and at very least if this for some reason is not possible that there are warning messages about these scams!!!! But no, nothing, the whole official Verge Twitter profil is FULL of scams that are tolerated and people like me, fall victims to it. Fine, i lost some 1.8 ETH, but hourly these scams seems to collect a huge amount of ETH that way and nobody there at Verge cares?

"The math behind Bitcoin mining has an element of lottery but it's very different to your analogy of kids finding Pokemon Go cards in the wild.

The main purpose of Bitcoin mining is to make corruption of the blockchain practically impossible. To continue with the Pokemon Go analogy, anyone can scan a Pokemon Go card and print it out in high quality, laminate it and sell it but nobody can do the same in Bitcoin because the miners have done a lot of work in keeping the integrity of the transactions.

I think one of the main things that could save crypto is the fact that it is a global market.

Both. Any intermediary nodes that route your payments don't need to be trusted.

I think the confusion is from bitcoin nodes. You can run a wallet on your phone that isn't actually a bitcoin node at all, but instead semi-trustlessly validates and sends transactions through a third party bitcoin node.

This is impossible with LN, because the only way to accomplish it would be to give that third party access to all of your money. You could run an LN node on your computer though, and connect to that with your phone.",1522896048

"That's a cute High School Essay, but again you are missing the point.  And I will requote this passage:

&amp;nbsp;

""The threshold can easily be changed in the future.  We can decide to increase it when the time comes.  It's a good idea to keep it lower as a circuit breaker and increase it as needed.  If we hit the threshold now, it would almost certainly be some kind of flood and not actual use.""

&amp;nbsp;

The TEMPORARY high transaction fees in late 2017 were EXACTLY what Satoshi put the limit in place for: The bitcoin network was spammed, it was not actual use.  It did not NEED to be higher at the time - get over it.

&amp;nbsp;

Now comes an even short quote of the same passage: ""We can decide to change it when the time comes.""

&amp;nbsp;

Let me shorten it again: ""We""

&amp;nbsp;

The network voted, and the network decided that a Hardfork for blocksize increases is not worth it right now.  Get over it.  Decentralization means changes come from the BOTTOM up, not from a select few.

Bcash IS a select few.  Bcash tried to force an agenda on the majority.  Satoshi hasn't spoken for years because he understands that this only works if he lets the consensus decide.  The consensus is certainly not Bcash lol.",1522894809

"I went on Sirin Labs webpage to read what the phone (Finney $999 USD) promises.

•	Secure P2P resource sharing
•	Built-in ""cold storage"" crypto wallet
•	Distributed Ledger Consensus

**SIRIN LABS Cyber Protection suite:**

•	Behavioral based Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
•	Blockchain based, full tampering proof
•	Physical security switch (for wallet protection)
•	Secured communications (VoIP, text, email)
•	Three-Factor authentication: Biometric, Lock Pattern, Behavioral

It's actually going to work in my benefit because by paying taxes on the Jan 1 value I've now brought my basis up to that level.

"Not sure if anyone will see this at this point, but I wanted to address why XVG price hasn't really responded. 

It is essentially a dead currency in terms of valuation.  Where big coins like Bitcoin give me a 50:1 average transaction value to price ratio, verge gives me numbers under 1.  This last move up was essentially because there is nobody left to sell.  So news like this still doesn't move the needle.  There is nobody out there to bail. 

That also means claims of manipulation are probably wrong.  If someone was pumping it they would be able to move price much more than it has gone. 

I have about $20 that I made from a quick mine in xvg.  I am only in it because my numbers say the risk is worth it.  I am amused that it is working because really everything else I see says stay away.  But that is just how my strategy works.

If they don't, since there isn't an argument in favor of the claims made, it'll just make them more convinced that the other side is dumb and that they're right.

Now on the other hand, if someone doesn't have any idea what's going on in the space, this is going to indoctrinate them with your opinions when they should be out researching, looking at actual information and forming their own opinion. 

So again, what is the goal of this image, other than to push your cause (i.e. that Bitcoin Cash is more in line with the whitepaper)? If you don't get my point by now look up the definition of propoganda.

But let me be clear, propoganda isn't bad on its own. It's only bad when it drowns out real information and discourse. My point was that this same image could've been very productive at disseminating real information about the chain split and how BCH and BTC are both in fact forks of the ""original"" chain, and yet it is propoganda which makes the whole point weaker, and just serves to further convince BOTH sides that they're right. You're not helping anyone here.

I think discourse on both subreddits is absolute trash, and I'm just genuinely trying explain why this kind of post makes me and a lot of other people all but completely discredit this sub, AND contributes to the shitstorm of fighting we see between ""sides"" of the ""scaling debate."" Also, I used ""small blocker"" to descibe myself almost entirely as a joke, in case that wasn't apparent. ",1522894263

"I saw the same thing happen with GTAT; it was really really sad watching lots of retail investors literally lose their life savings for a company that was about as hyped as the crypto markets.

The truth is one of the main things propping up the price right now is the lack of liquidity to fiat; e.g. alot of crypto rich guys are only crypto rich... if they all tried to start cashing out to fiat the price wouild tank. So instead everyone is pinning their hopes on bitcoin acceptance as currency in the future (LN)... except that the same problem will happen: if Starbucks or Target or whoever starts widely accepting bitcoin and people who are crypto long start spending those coins the merchants will need to trade those coins for fiat anyway (Starbucks coffee suppliers are not likely to want to accept crypto at least at first) So the liquidity crunch still happens but just one transaction down the line. 

The price will not recover until we get a sustained large influx of fiat into the crypto again and that wont happen until retail investors see an ability to transact in bitcoin on any scale thats not what it currently is (tiny) which will happen but the growing pains of getting people transacting in bitcoin is going to cause the price to drop to 1-2K. Thats my entry point.",1522892290
Not entirely silly. Anyone can start a Walmart competitor but it doesn’t mean people will shop there. Bitcoin has more security and more distribution and is more decentralized. And there’s the network effect too. Try starting a new Facebook and it’s not so easy. ,1522892216
"Question now is how many legs does this next downturn have... If we are only on the first round of 3. We get 5500 BTC on the second downturn and around 5000 BTC on the third.... Just think about that for a second and let it sink in.

I warned those earlier today to tether up around 6850, I told you guys it was a pivot point and that it was being manipulated with bots to hold the price. Of course most FOMO greedy crypto HODLers had their heads in the clouds!",1522892213
"&gt;Eventually one will overcome based on how much of the network they've convinced.

This is the crucial part. How is the network going to be convinced to chose one transaction over the other?

&gt; it doesn't really matter who wins because the two blocks are equivalent.

The two blocks are not equivalent. In one block, Mallory paid Alice, and in the other block, she paid Bob. Only one can be true. How do you suggest that the network choses? “Randomly”, you will say, but how to implement this? You will see that there is no way to do so without some party being able to manipulate the outcome of this “random” picking.

Solving the double spending problem is the biggest innovation of Bitcoin.",1522892179

For that reason alone, even if he is nobody special with no special knowledge or abilities, he is fighting the good fight and I think he deserves support.

They print tether to increase liquidity. It wouldn't raise the price of usdt. It only looks that way when there is low liquidity because tether is still a cryptocurrency tied to bitcoin. When bitcoin goes up in price it brings usdt up a little too. But that's temporary and usdt goes back down. They print tether becasue exchanges want more tether. More tether increases the amount of volume an exchange can go through. Binance could have them personally print them 100m and it will pay for itself in less than a month last time I did the math based on volume exchange growth with printing of tether. ,1522890881
"Something like that is not predictable, but when bitcoin is on a hard downtrend, and then is artificially pumped up by some random 400$ increase, it is easy to predict that it will come down again.

"&gt;Well, it does

I think that largely depends on the motivation behind the person saying it, and how much they actually know about the protocol.  For me, I talk very little about Bitcoin Cash at all, or Bitcoin for that matter, in my daily life.  If I talk to my friends about how much ""BCash"" we have, we keep it in friendly stride and are not hell-bent on seeing BCH dominate the world's currency.

Online, I see people call BCH BCash on public forums, I laugh it off (it is an obvious easy bullshit name that has more power than it should), but when I see someone say ""what is bcash?"" (When it is obvious that they know the context.)  I cringe.

So, while your so-called trolls can sling the word back and forth so easily, it is the reactions of the people who are offended by it that leave the lingering yucky impression about it all.

If people who share the same ego about BCH more interested in establishing a cult, that's fine.  It's your decision.",1522890846

I think that's enough... you can go through his tweets on your own and find more. Roger was on board with BCH from Day 1, not after S2X/NYA got derailed. (I'm proudly one of the reasons why it got derailed, btw...) 

And I'll also remind you he referred to BCH as ""my project"" in that infamous video interview when he flipped the interviewer. He later apologised on r-btc, but you have to wonder if that ""my project"" was a Freudian slip... is Roger behind the fork? I guess we'll never know.

But one thing is sure - No need to rewrite history. Roger did not wait, he was on board with BCH immediately. These are documented facts.

"Couldn't read past the first few sentences and began to skim the rest, but:

1. Cryptos are a new asset class. Will the stock market ever be the foreign exchange market? Will the stock market ever become the precious metals market? Doesn't make sense does it? Cryptocurrencies are their own thing.

2. There are parts of the world where there are multiple national currencies. In the US, it may not be different currencies, but there are numerous different payment methods that can be used. Cash, credit/debit, paypal, apple pay, android pay, etc. Who is to say that crypto currencies won't just be added as another payment method when the technology becomes suitable for adoption (i.e better wallets)

3. Bitcoin is the first mover. Up until a year or two ago, there was no real competition and almost *everything* was specualtion - but now, more and more cryptos are approaching a final product that is slowly seeing more and more adoption (i.e ripple). It is why bitcoin's dominance dropped so hard this year. The next substantial drop in dominance will come when more fiat-to-alt pairs come into fruition. When bitcoin is no longer needed to buy alts. This is why bitcoin is being dubbed as a store of value for the future.

4. Ethereum is pretty much the default ico platform at this point. Much like bitcoin was the first mover for cryptos/peer-to-peer transctions, ethereum was this for smart contracts. As soon as there is more competition (eos, neo, etc), ethereum will lose its dominance on the market. So no, it's not a platform for scams; it's just that all tokens default to building on ethereum and a part of those tokens end up becoming scams.",1522888864

Some coins will move with it, many will be long gone. Crypto is here to stay, but the days and age of endless gains are over. Discipline as a trader can still give gains, the space has a lot to prove ethically if it wants to get back to the roots and challenge fiat beyond greed.",1522887300
"VeChain but their road map they put out about 2 months ago showed them thinking towards 2025 for when big adoption will occur.

2019-2021 regulatory development. 

2022 growth. People finally have a direction and can fully adopt something like VeChain and 2022 and beyond will be the S curve of adoption. 

So when figuring out good investments you need to see who has a long range plan. Who has the funding and know how to survive years. 

Like BTC, XRP, LTC, XLM, XMR have survived years so far and are in the top 10.

All the adoption &amp; tech in the world will be worthless if CSW (fake Satoshi) is running around on stage as the public face of BCH.  Any benefit from Bitpay integrations, CoinText.io projects, or potential Purse.io support will all be destroyed.

As long as CSW is on stage, it's going to end up being the cryptocurrency world against Fake Satoshi's BCH.  **From a marketing &amp; branding perspective, this is a disaster**.  

For example, [Vitalik Buterin has been consistently on the side of Bitcoin Cash](https://www.yours.org/content/3c637b53d926/#comment-9eaf227d59c3).  But even he is [publicly calling CSW a fraud](https://www.trustnodes.com/2018/04/03/vitalik-buterin-calls-craig-wright-fraud).  

This is a fire that needs to be put out now.

If Bitcoin Cash is ever to be the #1 mainstream cryptocurrency, it can't do it with CSW's name as a permanent anchor.

The Real Satoshi operated anonymously, and was able to create Bitcoin, birth the cryptocurrency universe, and change the world with a whitepaper we all read.

The fact that CSW thinks he must run around publicly on stage to make a difference is just another piece of evidence that he is not Satoshi, but rather a fraudster.

CSW needs to get off the stage, and go into the lab.

I'm sure you're going to disagree, but I'm personally glad the devs are taking the time they need to get this right, letting the perfect get in the way of the good, so that Bitcoin can become something that will last for thousands of years.

I understand why Roger is such a divisive character, when you combine an arrogant, obstinate, and completely inexorable approach tinged with arrogance along with with making valid points, you’re gonna piss people off. But by Satoshi, his arguments are absolutely legitimate. This pie-throwing dispute is comical to witness as the next gen alts are lining up to make a move.

"Same here!  So complicated this year too as we started a non-profit, my husband doesn't want to use the ""first in-first out"" type accounting for the purchase/sale of BTC so that is another situation.  Also, we have another side ""business"" with foreign exchange students living with us so I have had to spend some hours entering receipts into a spreadsheet.  We made the most money this past year that we have ever made, reinvested much of it back into BTC, but still have to pay the taxes on that as income so it will be interesting.  Praying we have enough cash in our account to cover it all.  We usually get thousands back from the IRS each year so this makes it even more depressing to file...  Oh, and coinbase said we made $6000 on a ETH sale (we dabbled in it a bit) but then there was a glitch where we were paid $0 for the stop loss order.  Not sure what happened.  We have had an open ticket for months now but then still need to pay short term capital gains on $6000 we never even received.  My husband contacted them and they said that we were going to be ""moved up"" on the list to close the open ticket.  With Coinbase maybe that means before the end of the year or something?  ;)  As if it wasn't depressing enough not even getting the cash.  Fun times.",1522886305
"&gt; Banning things is not that easy outside of authoritarian countries.

There are a plethora of reasons a government could give to legitimize banning cryptoassets, from the volatility of the market, the difficulty of regulating under existing securities exchange infrastructure, the difficulty of taxing under existing tax infrastructure, the ability to use RingCT and zk-snark transactions to create anonymity, the amount of stress mining puts on the electrical grid, the fact that illegal trade still makes up the vast majority of BTC's B2C application... Banning full nodes isn't even an effective way to ban bitcoin anyway. It doesn't stop people from using it, trading with it, accepting payment through it, investing in it, or even mining it.

&gt; Also you probably want to read up on history of gold standard. Gold mining was not the reason it became outmoded.

You're right. Gold is no longer used as a standard because, as I said, you can't apply monetary policy to something that comes out of the ground. It has nothing to do with the fact that all gold emerges out out of the same structures.",1522886279

I might not understand it fully but it has to do with Governments that make money worth something. There is massive amount of debt, people have massive amounts of money. It's only worth something because the Government accepts it (taxes) and $20 is worth $20 to businesses and other people.

Now crypto comes into play. People start being able to pay for items and food with crypto. Soon you'll be able to buy a house. Sure property taxes and other taxes will still be paid in USD.

But things can get ugly the more that switch to say Bitcoin. 

It'll be a slow and long process over years and decades perhaps.

But soon loans, debts. What happens if money becomes worthless thanks to crypto.

Today people might have 5% crypto and the rest not crypto. But say more people move money into crypto. Market cap grows. Soon more people have 50% crypto 50% non crypto.

"Completely different circumstances.  Bomber was trying to manipulate them because he scammed the coins, it had nothing to do with an exploit on Nano's end.  The exploit was actually on Bomber's end with his incoming deposits doing a double and it occurred with Litecoin and others. Folks figured it out and started banging away.  Took bomber weeks to figure it out, he hid it, then tried to manipulate Nano so he could recover losses.  The rest is history.  He stole Millions of Nano.

For Verge, it's really how you see it.  The exploit used time stamps to jump in front of the line in the mining pool so the mining rigs that were programmed to fake the stamp could gain priority basically every other block.  It was also done to another coin first and then Verge second.  Nothing was really stolen per se, more like you got to mine for three hours unfairly and suck up an unfair portion of all the mined coins.  This was caught by a very smart guy who runs a mining pool.  Once he figured it out and posted on it the attack stopped and Verge did a hot fix to get the mining pools up and running again.  Wallets were also fixed.  The fork will fix things permanently and serve to make the coin better.  Exploit fix and move on.  250k coins were mined unfairly.  

I guess it depends how you view it.  To me, a huge part of business is fixing mistakes and how you handle these things.  Every website, OS, bank, etc has been hacked or exploited.  It comes with the territory.  If you fix it quick and take it seriously than that is due diligence.  It didn't effect me, my coins are safe as are everyone else's.  Obviously it can be more FUD and if you hated Verge you still hate it.  If you love Verge then you say great job the coin is better.  If you see Verge as viable and are cautiously optimistic, then you say it's fixed and I hope it doesn't tank or cause any harm to their upcoming announcement.

Yup. CNBC is about as unreliable and biased as you can get when it comes to crypto.,1522885241
"Yes I really understand what you means, but no, the blocksize is not a dos protection, it is a lever that helps adoption and multiplication of nodes by allowing a newcomer to download the full blockchain (5 days for bitcoin on a raspberry, +infinity for ethereum (and I love ethereum)). The fees are that dos protection. If everybody moves from BTC to BCH, you will see that 1 : the fees increases, 2 : the blocks will be full because it costs less than BTC and then : nobody will run a fullnode, like what happens in ethereum. 

The day a true sharding system exists with no consequences for miners, and the day transactions can be send on a sidechannel,  the community will agree to raise the blocksize. But the Bitcoin community don't want to brick Bitcoin with a small modification that could break a 200 billion dollar protocol.
But I think It is a healthy debate and I am happy to see that BCH has done a fork with other parameters. 
And unhappy with all the trolls both sides.

The free market can let the users choose. You should be happy :)",1522885217

"I think you get what I am saying it's that the wise investors grow in influence while the less wise ones lose economic energy. What I was affirming is that this diminishes volatility over time.

&gt; Correct me if I wrong, you suggest the value we will retain, will be the value/amount of people that understood said incentive design within Bitcoin? They keep it, because they know it will pump again? 

to some degree, you are oversimplifying it, but yes that is one way to understand it. 

&gt;They keep it, because they know it will pump again? 

In Evolution it survival of the fittest. Only the investors who grow stronger survive, the week ones die off, it could be us, holders, are the week ones we won't know, but the ones who make the independent choices while behaving cooperatively are the investors who will survive. In crypto, Holding has proven to be the most effective investment strategy, but things are always clear in hindsight. So it's not a guarantee of anything. 

Things may be changing they we may need to start earning and spending bitcoin not just holding it. 

&gt;but I was pretty much saying that people that enter in the future, will likely be less smart, which results in a higher 

There are probably many more smart people entering than me, but those with wisdom and those who cooperate can increase the value of their holdings. At the end of the day, it's about having as big a piece of the biggest pie, not just a big piece of the pie.

&gt;because these people are weaker hands, because they are less smart,

yes, week hands are one way to look at it, but I'd use wise as opposed to smart. 

FOMO works both ways up and down, Holders could be bag holders. 

Volatility also works both ways price going up or down = volatility and a monetary unit that is 80% issue that is still to be widely addopted is going to be incredibly volatile until it has reached equilibrium.

"I knew it would. 

First who is actually using NEO? Anyone? 

Second it was 10 cents for the longest time. Someone accumulated almost all the coins then it was rebranded and pumped. People bought into the hype and bought some extremely overpriced NEO. Someone made a killing 10 cents to $200 plus Bitfinex has margin trading so people could go 3.3x long and then short the top for more profit.

IOTA was 14 cents and was pumped to $5.80 for a coin that last time I checked was broken. Legit people hyping and buying something that doesn't work. Looking at the price I'd guess it doesn't work right still + no one using it.

Finally. LTC went $48 to $3. Before the bull run coins were a couple million dollars market cap or under a million dollar market cap.

New money (dumb money) isn't going to pour in and buy broken and overpriced coins no one is using / adopting. 

Especially when you can short the coin without even holding any on Bitfinex.

"&gt; Wouldn't it be much more likely that Bilderberg/AXA/ and the CIA are hiring the paid shills for anti-csw trolling?? 

No. Why the fuck would the Bilderberg group give a single flying fuck about Craig Wright? It is much much more likely that he and nChain would hire shills to promote/repair his shattered reputation so that they can market a huge batch of patents from “the creator of Bitcoin”.

There is no pretence. Anyone who take the time to dig through my 5+ year history will see me consistently supporting block size increases since the time when Gavin and Mike first proposed XT.

Not remotely true. I’ve literally never attempted to open a lightning channel. I will, however, defend LN when other people who have never tried to use it spread all kinds of FUD and nonsense about it because they think it threatens their favourite crypto.

"Being wealthy in crypto, blocked from all banks in the country, and in desperate need for cash to travel is red flags that points towards something being wrong.

There is no single 300 BCH donation to the Bitcoin Cash fund that I can see from their address history, in total there is not much more than 300 BCH donated in all.

But even if he donated 300 BCH and proved it to you with a signed message, it does not in any way reflect on his current situation or if it is wise to be involved with buying any goods from him.

Note that the Bitcoin Cash Fund asks donators to get in contact with them personally before donating more than 1000 usd.

I am not saying that he will steal the money, I think that is unlikely, especially in a country like Iceland, but buying the Bitcoin Cash in those circumstances can put you in legal trouble by being implicated in money laundering or helping a fugitive. He asks for USD, EURO, or the local currency (ISK), while at the same time claiming that he has no access to any banking services, that makes no sense unless there is something strange going on. Iceland does not take euro or usd in cash as payment.

If someone offers you to exchange 10 000 usd for 6000 usd worth of euro, in person, in cash, then you know that you are most likely involved in something sketchy. Even if you exchange the money in the police station, after the bills have been examined and verified, you are still putting yourself up for a possibility of being implicated in some sort of criminal network.",1522884531
"&gt; First of all, the quantum computers of D-Wave can't be used for Shor's and Grover algorithms.

While not Shor's exactly, it's been brought up in the QRL discord that D-Wave has been demonstrated to be able to perform prime factorisation: https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.05796

""We investigate prime factorization from two perspectives: quantum annealing and computational algebraic geometry, specifically Gr\""obner bases. We present a novel scalable algorithm which combines the two approaches and leads to the factorization of all bi-primes up to just over 200000, the largest number factored to date using a quantum processor.""

&gt; Also, the quantum computers are more of a threat to the ECDSA than to SHA-256.

&gt; While the consequences of the above for elliptic-curve crypto would be fatal, Grover's algorithm (which can lower the security of hash functions) still wouldn't make the SHA easy to attack.

Awesome distinction and summary!",1522884490
"I think a lot of the value is in it being the only form of money I am aware of that is transparent and auditible.

In general it is also less expensive and quicker than most other methods to make large value transfers with.

You can also use Bitcoin without fear that some gatekeeper like your bank, credit card, or government will reject the transaction.

Lastly you can buy stuff with it which is pretty practical especially when combined with the other qualities I just listed.

Why would you choose to open your new business then and not in a year or layer. Now imagine buying with usd. You have 50,000 and it will cost 50,000. You look at the inflation rate and see it will cost 60,000 to open it next year at the same spot. Why wouldn't you open your business right away to prevent loss. ",1522884376

"**Pretty Good Privacy**

Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is an encryption program that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication. PGP is used for signing, encrypting, and decrypting texts, e-mails, files, directories, and whole disk partitions and to increase the security of e-mail communications. Phil Zimmermann developed PGP in 1991.

PGP and similar software follow the OpenPGP standard (RFC 4880) for encrypting and decrypting data.

The inflationary reward had to happen one way or another, as there needed to be an initial distribution of the coins. Satoshi's way of doing it was quite clever IMHO. And again, if you read Austrian Economists, Mises in particular, you'll understand that any amount of currency is enough. It's the variation of this amount in time that might not be beneficial. Again, Satoshi was clever enough to make the inflationary curve asymptotic, making inflation less and less representative as time goes by, up until the point it is completely negligible.",1522884184

To define the ""network effect"" in any sort of meaningful sense, you'd have to either talking about merchant adoption, or number of people who own coins. Forcing everyone to upgrade to LN throws merchant adoption out the window. So all you're left with is the distribution of coins. Which, as of the fork was exactly the same for Bitcoin Cash.

LN is starting over as far as merchant adoption goes. It's on a level playing field with every random shitcoin in that respect. Except it's not even done/stable right now.

Everyone who owned Bitcoin before August now has BCH as well, so regardless of what ""network effect"" BTC there's literally no reason at all for anyone to stick with BTC. Except name recognition.

It will not increase the wealth gap. (does that matter, why if not jealousy?) Bitcoin as a system encourages saving. Saving makes capital available to the people who can provide better things or services more efficiently. And the deflation makes it possible for extra competent people to get access to the capital at no extra cost. (nominal rates can be zero if you have a steady deflation rate. People have shown willing before to fund people for their competences even though their plans are wildly unlikely. But because they are potentially life changing for mankind.

"As /u/s-h-d-p explained in a reply to this very comment, Shorting means ""to bet against"". Longing means ""to bet in favor of"".

 The mechanism is as follows:

 * If you want to short/bet against Bitcoin, what you will be doing, in essence, is taking a borrowed amount of Bitcoin, say, 1 Bitcoin at 7k/btc value. You will immediately sell this Bitcoin for 7k USD dollars. You still owe the lender one full Bitcoin. So if Bitcoin's price goes up to 8k/btc, you'll essentially be oweing the lender 8k dollars, paid in Bitcoin, so you will be down 1k dollars, plus lending fee. If Bitcoin's price goes down to 6k dollars, you'll essentially be oweing the lender 6k dollars, paid in Bitcoin, plus lending fee. The 1k difference is yours to take home.

 * If you want to long/bet in favor of Bitcoin, what you will be doing, in essence, is taking a borrowed amount of dollars, say, 7k dollars, and immediately buying Bitcoin (say it's now 14k) with that value, at a fixed price. This means you'll be ""buying"" 0.5 bitcoin, and you will owe the lender 7k dollars. If bitcoin doubles in price to 28k, your 0.5 Bitcoin will now be worth 14k. As you borrowed dollars, all you owe the lender is 7k plus lending fee, and the rest 7k is yours to take home.

Now, usually you don't short ""naked"". Traders usually short/long with leverage. That means they leave a few bucks in the Exchange as guarantee, and the exchange allows them to take as much as 200x more money than that to open short/long positions. However, if trading at 200x, a simple slip of 0.5% in the other direction of your bet will wipe your account entirely. If at 100x, 1% in the other direction of your bet will wipe your account entirely. And 1% in your direction will give you 100% gains. Usually traders use ""low"" leverages (25x-50x is high, 100x-200x is ABSURD) so their positions are ""immune"" to volatility and they can set stop losses to avoid getting entirely burned.

"The most likely scenario is that BTC were stolen from the servers, not through a bug in the code. I have asked the trustee for an image of the server at the time, but this could be an issue with our hosting provider of the time, like what happened with Linode hack (which also ended flowing to Vinnik).",1522881025
"That’s fine since they’re not contributing to the network. I don’t know how you could measure that other than inspecting their settlement transactions. 

The great thing about many of the upcoming bitcoin soft forks is that any of these on-chain settlement transactions become indistinguishable from other on-chain transactions. ",1522880994
"People weren’t excited about the % gains, people were excited by the fact btc rebounded. People will be just as excited if it happens again. I‘ll take those excited comments over the low effort trolling comments any day of the week. ",1522880969
"Stop acting captain hindsight my god, everyone can a read a chart, price history doesn’t mean shit, how does the fact that bitcoin was 300 dollars years ago relevant to the current situation? ITS NOT ",1522880958
Ta is about 15% useful in crypto,1522880920
"Because that's actually what happened, more or less. It was extremely stagnant in price.  
  
This is important to see because it highlights that for the majority of bitcoin's lifetime, it was not going to the moon.  The majority of it's lifetime, it was not increasing exponentially. Thus the log chart misrepresents the data for the lifetime of bitcoin.",1522880905
"...or it might be 6.5k, the truth is for bitcoin to succeed it needs to be 6 figures per coin. I'm not saying it will happen, no one can be sure but it has a fighting chance. If you're thinking of investing, it may not be worth the risk of trying to catch the knife (buy at the absolute bottom) - I think that's what OP was inferring. ",1522880892
"Yes, you are correct. Problem is, history is often twisted in this sub. I don't think Roger was involved with BCH at all, as I recall he was trying to sort out how BTC could be salvaged with 2x.

There is a reason why he is not able to sell the Bitcoin Cash at an moderately discounted price, and there is a reason why he is selling an non-trivial amount on short notice for cash in person.",1522880606
"What do we think would happen to the market if 160,000 of BTC was suddenly redistributed to creditors? Would BTC drop as they sell it for fiat? Would alts rise as they diversify their investment?",1522880587

""*No one doubts Verge has a partner.

I literally kept telling them all 'this is more then likely a bad project or a scam, if you believe in Power token, sure, if you believe in XRP, sure- But if you're looking at Verge like you can trust it, your in for a not good surprise.'

What I'm really getting at is if people want to just take whatever the media is hyping at this point in the crypto game, and the media is doing such a piss poor job of judgement in good and bad projects- I feel this market will collapse very badly and literally theyres only going to be a handful of legitimate tokens or cryptos look to.

"I fail to see the ""destruction"" and looking at the graveyard of similar comments on other threads I suppose I will suffer the same fate, but so be it, I will still try to understand.

How are these two systems even comparable at this stage? Bitcoin Cash has benefited of what the ecosystem developed for year for Bitcoin, it required only few adaptations to systems such as Bitpay to ""adopt"" it, making it available to virtually all the existing merchants that already supported Bitcoin through them. Lightning Network is a system for which the first beta working on mainnet was released less than 3 weeks ago. Before a malleability fix could be implemented in Bitcoin there was no incentive to develop this technology, it wouldn't have been testable/deployable on a significant scale, anyhow development still continued and it made it possible to have a release within months of this fix being implemented. So this comparison seem like a false equivalence by the sheer magnitude of both systems, which is a logical fallacy.

Later in this debate, the only argument he brought to the table for being in such a rush for this adoption to happen is that babies are getting killed, without much context/examples or in other words by vaguely generalizing a situation claiming that this was the direct cause of babies' deaths. While sound money might be a solution to this problem at some point, it isn't in any way the announced goal of any of these projects. Before anyone rains on me, I would also love for Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies in any of their form to solve this, but clearly it would be an indirect resolution. So this turns out to be the perfect example of a ""will someone think of the children"" fallacy (appeal to emotions/pity), it's unbelievable how this very old trick seems to still work on crowds these days.

So someone please enlighten me on how using fallacies lead to ""destroying"" the other party in a debate? In my book, if you have to resort to these tactics you have actually lost, not just the debate, but credibility.",1522879532

"I'm so amazed by how extremely on point this is. This isn't a very popular topic on Reddit, but I'm an astrologer (I also work in energy trading). I'm still learning basics on cryptocurrency, but I am interested in financial astrology. 

In the astrology community, one of the biggest topics for the past couple of years has been the planet Uranus moving into the sign of Taurus in May 2018. The sign of Taurus, represented by a Bull, symbolizes material wealth, money, and finance. The planet Uranus symbolizes radical change and technology. The movement of Uranus into Taurus is being discussed by numerous astrologers as a symbol for the introduction of cryptocurrency to mass markets, there is so much content written on that. I'm posting some examples, but all you need to do is google ""uranus taurus cryptocurrency"" to see how much has been written on the subject. 

Like I mentioned above, the symbol for Taurus is a bull. I'm totally floored that I'm browsing the cryptocurrency subreddit, and I see your art. It is very esoteric, a perfect picture of the concept of crypto and Uranus in Taurus.  I actually wondered if you already knew about this astrological correlation and based your artwork off of this until I read the comments that the bull in your picture represents the markets. Maybe you've just tapped into the collective unconscious in a beautiful and meaningful way. 

Fun anecdote: The concept of the sign of Taurus, depicted as a bull, as the symbol of money/wealth in the zodiac has been around since Babylon, around 1000 BCE. This concept became very popular in the Hellenistic period, around 300 BCE.  It's no secret that banks, governments, and corporations use occult and esoteric imagery in their branding. Since Taurus the Bull = Wealth, Wall Street and banks adopted the image of the bull in their branding. (Another example of this is how financial institutions use a black cube in their imagery/branding, because it is the symbol for Saturn). 

I haven't read through these particular articles all the way through, I just wanted to show you that the concept of Uranus/Taurus/Crypto is out there. If you're looking to promote your artwork, you should consider posting it in the astrology subreddit saying something like ""My Crypto Art / Uranus in Taurus"".

"&gt; Those investors neurons who make good solid pathways and work independently but cooperatively are made stronger, those who don't are discarded by the Darwinian evolutionary process.

Granted I am currently stoned, I loved to read this sentence. Correct me if I wrong, you suggest the value we will retain, will be the value/amount of people that understood said incentive design within Bitcoin? They keep it, because they *know* it will pump again? 


I totally agree with that. 



I'm not sure, again feel free to correct me here, but I was pretty much saying that people that enter in the future, will likly be less smart, which results in a higher 

&gt; Darwinian evolutionary process.


because these people are weaker hands, because they are less smart. Now I suggest *on average* less smart. 


Your beautiful sentence, that I totally agree with, really states how it is that we can hold a level of Xusd per BTC at all ie. 6000$/4000$ being stronger and ever increasing stronger resistance levels, but my original point was about volatility. 


And by volatility I mean all the people entering in the future, probably being less smart and filtered out quicker than before ( Darwin ), results that whilst the next ATH may be 30k ballpark area, but we're also correcting harder, because the new hands are becoming ever increasingly weaker hands aswell. 



Dude, tell me if I'm too stoned, I will re-read this when I'm sober, but it really feels like my original point still holds? Also, feel free to point me towards the last time we had a 75% drop in value. AFAIK that was when MtGox happened. Last January we had a correction too, it recovered 2016 December ATH roughly around Febuary 20th. I think we dropped 45% in value. 


Granted, I can't claim to know whether or not the ""FUD-level"" was equally as hitting as it was this year.",1522878965

Haha thanks but my comment was a bit tongue in cheek. I made sure I mentally wrote off any money I invested in crypto and am well aware that it may well end up being a zero sum game. I really enjoyed the ride up to the all time highs but I found the whole thing was taking up so much time. The plan was always to accumulate some crypto and just stash it away and check back long term. I used to trade the little peaks and dips to gain more crypto and having Delta installed and checking on prices and alerts often tempted me to log into the exchange and make a couple of trades. I needed to free myself of that as I got other shit to do!,1522878917
"I do know that. There is a reason for it too. The ones who create all the inflation also own most of the gold. So they set the price of it. So they keep it on pace with inflation. It’s the central bank hedge. 

The last decade has been more of the last stretch for financializing of economies. It’s no different than those who want to tokenize everything. We have already done that for the last 3 decades. Everything is securitized right now. Including real estate. 

Now as for living within your means. How can a family of four do that after a decade of stagnant wages. House taxes go up. Insurance goes up. These take away any extra purchasing power the consumer has. But great the value of your house goes up. Why not just take out home equity. Well then you just pulled forward future consumption. For what a new refrigerator or a vacation to Disney World. 

If you are 65 yrs old and only have $1000 in savings you maybe ok. But if you are younger then you are one step closer to adding debt for emergencies. I’m being real and I’ve been fortunate for the things I’ve done. But the reality is a majority of the ppl are at fragile points in their lives for most of their lives. 

The cure is to change the money. Bitcoin is that chance. It’s not an investment. It’s your chance to escape from those who control it to control you. The more ppl who think the same way it eventually becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. So save in it. ",1522878898

"No, my original comment was not referring to bitcoin although it might serve as an example.

&lt;I guess what Cardano is trying to do is make sure none of these issues are within the project to make a really sound and secure solution.

I get what you are saying, but I just don't think that's how software development works. You have to deploy and battle-test all the time as there are always too many parameters that you could not anticipate. No peer review will ever be able to ensure a sound and secure solution, the reviewers are just humans themselves, maybe devoting some hours each on a paper. 

If you want to proof a system to be secure, deploy it with a large incentive to be hacked and demonstrate that it still cannot be compromised. ",1522878891

"I have a degree in Economics and am an ex-financial advisor, and have always just loved finance, so naturally I gravitated towards investing. So I began investing for my retirement, and I usually put my money in index funds (SWPPX, SFILX, SWSSX). After I had about a year or two under my belt, I started to look for ETFs/stocks in certain sectors I like (technology, finance, etc.). I am in a vanguard ETF that tracks US tech companies (ticker symbol VGT) which I view as a way to invest in companies that are involved with blockchain. IBM, Apple, Nvidia and others are stocks included in this fund. As for crypto projects, I like VeChain, Stellar, Ethereum, Kin, Ripple (I know, I know) and OmiseGo. I hold lots of other coins (20+) but those are some that I feel most confident about. (VeChain is my favorite, don’t get me started lol)

I really think you should start with the stock market, mainly to start saving for retirement (best time to start is when your young). Even if it’s just $50 a month into a Roth IRA. They’re regulations and established companies, compared to crypto which is full of scams and people trying to hack you and steal your tokens! You also need to have a little bit of technical knowledge to research crypto projects properly (I work in IT). 

As you’ve probably seen, crypto is super risky and volatile, and you really have to be ready and willing to lose the money you’ve invested. I basically consider crypto to be the riskiest part of my overall investment portfolio. I treat them like an emerging market stock. 

Sorry for the super long response, I hope this helps! Feel free to PM me if you have more specific questions about investing. ",1522878763

"I think purpose-thing will lead us nowhere - now that might have to do with the fact that English is not my first language. 

What I was trying to say is this: I own a sports car as a daily driver with 450 hp, it is a lot of fun, but the fuel consumption is insane, more than twice what the manufacturer claimed, and because the tank is really small, I spend quite some time at gas stations. But the ""purpose"" of a sports car is to have fun driving, not to be fuel efficient. And the purpose of Bitcoin based on the whitepaper was clearly to be digital cash for the world - now this may result in long download times for the blockchain - so be it. 

To optimize the download-time of the blockchain is the same as to optimize fuel consumption of a sports car - you end up with a normal car, or a... wait for it... settlement-layer for the lightning network ;)

And about running your private non-mining-node: it is useless because it could be disconnected from the network, the rest of the network could run a different version of the software that you missed installing etc. Bitcoin is designed as a trustless system as you already mentioned - so it is basically a contradiction if you say ""I need to run my own node because I do not trust the trustless system"".",1522878600

&gt;Because you want the basic layer to be as *decentralised* and secure as possible, there is **nothing which comes close or will ever come close**.

That right there is a claim that bitcoin is the most decentralised coin and that nothing will ever compare to its awesome decentralisation. No speculation about you required.

If you claim that the state in which bitcoin’s mining pools are in right now is decentralised then you truly do not understand the concept of decentralisation, a far more fundamental concept in cryptocurrency than how mining pools work.",1522877630

"How are they dying because bitcoin doesn’t work if bitcoin cash does?  Their problems can’t be fixed with gold, so is it’s golds fault that they’re dying too?  Bitcoin can’t solve all of the problems it is capable of solving individually.  Like Mow said, we still need infrastructure and the guarantee that bitcoin will solve the problem scalable, not that it solves everything immediately at the expense of making things harder down the line.

I swear half of these threads are made of of my previous bosses.  ‘It’s easy, just x, y and z and the problem is fixed when in reality, those steps don’t actually fix the entire problem, they break 3 other things, and they make a, b and c, which are also supposed to be fixed yesterday, if not sooner, immeasurably harder to build.

"Think of shorting like this.

Person A owns bitcoin.  You agree to borrow their bitcoin, with the guarantee that you will return it with some interest in the future.

So, you borrow person A's bitcoin, and immediately sell THEIR bitcoin.  You just figure that you need to buy that bitcoin back in the future.  Since bitcoin is going to go down, if you sell it now for 13k and buy it back later for 8k, you've made a tidy profit of 5k (minus interest).

Of course, bitcoin could go up in value.  If it goes up, you STILL owe person A 1 bitcoin.  So you lose however much the bitcoin goes up by.

Exchanges automate and protect this entire process.  They require you to own 1/5th of whatever you short (the 5x leverage part).  That way the exchange knows that even if bitcoin goes up, they are holding your funds to ensure that you can still buy that bitcoin back.  If bitcoin goes up 18%, the exchange automatically buys that bitcoin back to close your short position and ensure person A gets paid back.",1522877464

&gt;Kevin Warsh, a former Fed board member and one of the Brookings panelists, held a different view explaining that quantitative easing as a policy works purely through an ""asset price channel"" enriching the few who own stocks or other financial products (and not the 96% of Americans who receive the majority of their income through labor).

To me, personally, I think bitcoin a risk-asset.  IMO- it is the best barometer of ""animal spirits"" I use to gauge risk appetite in general, and I'll apply that to other markets.  With this in mind, I think if trade wars pull in risk appetite elsewhere, I think bitcoin follows as well, sorry.  If I thought it was a safe-heaven, I can easily see it the other way as well.  These stances almost needs to be somewhat fluid too, because it doesn't have an iron clad set public opinion yet.

Finally, media largely works for ratings for ad spend.  Calling this stage of the game a 'trade war' is a bit sensationalist, solely because the amount in tariffs is microscopic both the scale of both economies.

"&gt; Ripple signaled that its future success hinges in part on getting XRP listed on the top trading venues. 

As much as they market themselves as being in partnerships with banks where XRP is being used in real world cases - the fact remains that XRP's value is purely speculative like the rest of the crypto space and it has no adoption and demand outside speculation whatsoever.

"You guys are being shortsighted.

There's multiple reasons why Robinhood is a good thing:

1) Liquidity and value. There are people who are just in this market to speculate, and that's it. They will eventually use crypto, but by the time they do, they are going to be late adopters, who are pretty much forced to use it, or because it's so convenient to use that it's just alot easier than using fiat or credit cards.

They could care less about the spending their crypto. *And that's fine*. Why is that fine? Because these are the people who are adding liquidity into the market, and adding value to the network.

Do you really think they are going to mess with QR codes or keys? It's all mumbo jumbo to them.

2) Innovation and competition. Everyone complains how hard crypto is to purchase, but this was ridiculously easy. I mean *stupid* easy, easier than purchasing stocks. This is setting a bar for other wallets, who need to work on their presentation and usability issues.

I've used everything from paper wallets, hardware wallets, web-based wallets, exchanges, and everything in between. This was the easiest experience by far, and is what *every* wallet should strive to be.

You guys don't like it? Well support some other technology and push it. Personally I think Ethos is the one, but they are a few months away from global adoption.

"Bitcoin is still thousands of % higher than it was even not that long ago, it's still pumped up way too high that's why it forms no solid support.

"&gt;The whole Bitcoin Cash position seems to be that if a lot of people aren't constantly spending coins on coffee and random retail stuff, it has no value and might as well be useless. Therefore fees need to be kept as low as possible so people spend more, which will somehow drive adoption. There's obvious parallels there in regards to the erroneous focus on the velocity of money as a measure of the economic system's health and growth.

Your argument is wrong though. You completely misunderstand the Austrian point of view, and also wrongly compare both situations. Let me elaborate.

The Keynesian point is that by stimulating __overall__ aggregate demand in any way possible you pull the economy out of a glut. The velocity of money increasing is an indicator that the measures to increase demand are working and, according to Keynesians, the economy is improving.

Austrians argue that downturns are not just a glut in aggregate demand, but there are actually real misalignments in the production system that show themselves as a decrease of the economic activity and entrepreneurs need some time to work them out. Austrians argue that artificial measures to boost aggregate demand like the Keynesians propose will only temporary hide the economic misalignments and will even make them bigger, setting up the economy for a bigger downturn in the future (commonly known as going from bubble to bubble).

But what you get wrong is that Austrians also think that an increase of the velocity of money indicates the economy is improving. What Austrians remark is that the source of that increase has to be organic for it to be sustainable. If the increase comes from some government action, its just hiding the problem temporarily at the cost of making it worse.

So what does all this has to do with Bitcoin Core vs Bitcoin Cash? Nothing.

You say that the reasoning behind focusing on merchant adoption is similar to the Keynesian position. But after reading the above explanation you have to see that is completely wrong. Both Keynesians and Austrians agree that velocity of money increasing is an indicator that the economy is improving. Where they disagree is how it should happen. Austrians argue it has to be organic, Keynesians say it has to be the government. Neither Bitcoin Cash, nor Bitcoin Core promote government intervention, so I fail to see how any of the two are similar to the Keynesian position, as you argue Bitcoin Cash is.

More importantly, Bitcoin Cash does not promote merchant adoption as a way to stimulate the velocity of money and that way stimulate the economy. You are completely misunderstand in g or misrepresenting Bitcoin Cash point.

The issue does not has to do with macroeconomics like you are saying, but with the basic fundamentals of how you value a currency. Bitcoin Cash proponents argue that merchant adoption and spending by its users increase the demand and the network effect of any currency. It makes it more useful, which for most people will make it more valuable. Nobody is stopping you from saving Bitcoin Cash, but by __also__ promoting commerce you are increasing its utility.

On the contrary, by just focusing of savings and even discouraging commerce, you are turning the currency into a musical chairs game, which is dangerously similar to a ponzi scheme (without strictly being one). Commerce gives you a cushion that makes the speculative highs and lows smoother because the demand is ""constant"". Remove commerce and you risk having a bear market where no counterforce stops it.

In conclusion, your exposition of Austrian theory is wrong, and on top of it does not matter because the Bitcoin Cash point is not about macroeconomics but about the fundamentals about what gives a currency value.",1522877051

"&gt; Everything you've said can be entirely mitigated by doing the following

I don't think you read my comment, then, because this procedure doesn't solve the issues I've described. Besides - I may be misunderstanding your ideas here, but how can someone who sends you a transaction also send you a Merkle branch for it when it is yet to be included in a block? This would not be possible to implement. If instead you are talking about the Bitcoin servers providing the SPV client the Merkle branch, then this still doesn't address my comments...

In particular, you seem to be making two primary arguments: 1) SPV is more private (opsec), and 2) SPV is easier to audit. Both of these assertions are silly. 

You suggest that Ross Ulbricht ought to have used an SPV wallet to improve the security of the Silk Road. Of course, this would subject SR to simple denial of service attacks via omission, and law enforcement could have made SR useless with little effort. Besides this, anytime SR was connected to a law enforcement full node, they would be able to gather additional SR wallet addresses and know they are interacting with SR. So the SR client better be running over Tor!....except that this doesn't solve the DoS vector or address clustering vector. In fact, your entire argument about how Ross should have just memorized his mnemonic and stored block headers is related to not loading a private key into the client - but you could just as easily do the same with a full node, and then you don't have to trust anyone.

The audit argument is even less coherent; as stated in my OP, you are still trusting full nodes and must include them in your audit as well. This presents further challenges due to not knowing necessarily which clients you must interact with. SPV requires more trust than running a full node - you can argue that it isn't much, but it is *something*, and certainly doesn't remove the need for auditing. Instead, it just makes auditing the code even more difficult.",1522876621

You could take precautions in a will. However losses will still occur. As it is not reversible over the decades won’t there be steady rate of loss as you say.

"It's simple for me:

What drew you to crypto?  Was it getting rich quick?  Then I don't know what to tell you.

I've made it a point to buy into many different coins all who are more than just part of a digital gold rush but instead seek to provide value whether it is anonymity or a development platform or to replace fiat.

I bought into them because I believed in them.  So why the hell would I sell now?  We're still like 4-5x higher than we were last year.  If at this point last year if a future version of myself traveled back in time and said ""not only will BTC cross the 2k ATH but in a year it'll be somewhere between $6k-7k in value"" I would have been over the moon.

I get why people are upset.  I don't like to think about the fiat value my portfolio has dropped, but I came up with a plan and I decided, for once, to trust my instincts and I'd rather see it all go bust (it won't) than to stop trusting my instincts, sell for a decent haul and then watch it climb again in the next 1-2 years.

"Additionally, i’m considering locking in small losses &lt;= $3000 between crypto-crypto trades.

Let’s say I purchase 1 eth for $1000, and then I immediately exchange it for 1000 of some altcoin and start with a zero cost basis. Then, during a crash where, hopefully, my eth-altcoin trading rate is still .001, I can exchange my 1000 alts back for the 1 eth, which is now sitting at a fiat value of $300.

That leaves me with a fiat tax loss of $700. I decide I like my altcoins and want them back, so I exchange my 1 eth for my 1000 alts straight away again, and there I have another zero cost basis with an additional $700 I can deduct on my taxes without having ~really~ lost anything since I’ll have the same amount of eth or altcoin.

Granted, this is the ideal scenario in which eth-alt trading rates stay stagnant, and that’s never guaranteed. But hey, there are no rules on wash sales for crypto, so why not try it, right?

I haven’t done any of this yet, mostly because I find keeping track of trades to be a headache, but I wonder if this is a viable way to take advantage of volatility even in a bear market.",1522875952

"&gt; that could justify, being up to par with Mtgox 80% volume hack?

How is the price determined in Bitcoin? The short answer is supply and demand, but on inspection, this is not like any other ""thing"" in history, I'll venture out on a limb and say it is the most supply inelastic thing ever.  

The price comes from speculation on future value. Arguably the value proposition does not change. The price goes up because of investor exuberance FOMO, and it comes back down when that fades. It is most accurately expressed in the [Mania and Blow-off phase in the hype cycle](https://bravenewcoin.com/assets/Uploads/_resampled/ResizedImageWzcyMCw0ODJd/four-stages-chart.jpg) when I entered Bitcoin we could see over 100% price growth in a day this volatility is diminishing as the network of speculators increases. 

While on the surface it may still look as volatile, daily volatility has shrunk and overall but not having looked at a measurement I can only express my opinion that I think the trend is still showing volatility decreasing over the 1, 7, 30, and 200-day moving averages. 

&gt;What did we have that was so concerning?

a wake-up call. 

&gt;Does she panic sell? 

She buys the dip. 

What is happening now is investors are forming a bitcoin brain the equivalent of a decentralized Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), and bitcoin neural pathways are being strengthened. Those ~~investors~~ neurons who make good solid pathways and work independently but cooperatively are made stronger, those who don't are discarded by the Darwinian evolutionary process.

"Do you understand how miningpools work? As I said before, it consists of individuals who mine together. Each individual makes its own decicions where and how to mine, the manager of the pool itself only has power as long as the users mine for them.

When a pool gets too dominant, miners move away to other pools, often the community acts as a guide in this, the more people complain about centralization in mining, the more individual miners will make a decision based on this. 

You dont have to suggest what I think or claim, I can do that for myself. I asked you to show centralization in bitcoin and the best you can come up with is a link how individual miners work together in pools. Its a pool, because they all mine under the same name at this moment, doesnt mean they act forever as one entity, 

You would make a better case for centralization if you would point out how bitmain is very dominant in mining, but with the new patents going on, that will also be solved very soon.

This my friend only shows how strong bitcoin is, when problems arise, individual users will take action to protect their own investment and that will lead to less centralization.

Then you call me an idiot for understanding these mechanics better than yourself. Besides that is not the nicest thing to do, I also dont think you understand what an idiot is. Again, you write stuff but you dont really understand what you write. Its ok though, you are entitled to have your individual opinion and us, as the community as a whole, discussion these things will lead to less centralization.

"&gt;ROI is already low. Initial Investment to start mining is higher and higher.

ROI is pretty much 8-9 months regardless of what you're mining. Cost of GPUs has gone up but CPU prices are pretty stable and mine cryptonight. 

&gt;If there is a true cap on the amount to be distributed, miners will get less and less and either: A) Fees will become high to compensate miners, B) It wont be worth the investment to start, giving control to the main facilities who started mining early. 

Which crypto is nearing the end of mineable blocks?

&gt;These miners will have complete control of crypto. It will lose the appeal that ""everyone can mine and help the blockchain"" 

Then the market should respond accordingly and place more value on crypto not mined by cartels. 

&gt;A certain few people will be in control. That's if the fee's aren't too high to even use it anymore. 
Correct me if I'm wrong please. I am an early adopter - I am holding and have been through the winter.


Mining isn't going away. GPU prices are soaring and manufacturers are preparing to load up shelves with GPUs while rolling out dedicated mining GPUs. There are ways to thwart cartel influence on an algo but it depends on dev activity and willingness to stay ahead of the curve. ",1522874721

"""Do you take &lt;worthless item X&gt; in lieu of payment?""

If Bitcoin was valuable, you wouldn't trade it for anything. You would hoard it. And if you absolutely *had* to part with it after exhausting all other options, you would try to replace it immediately by buying more of it. Would it stop you from buying things you need? No, of course not. You need to pay living costs, pay for entertainment, eat food. But I think rationally you *should* spend the constantly inflating US dollar before parting with your _precious_ limited digital resource.

Once business owners start seeing the light, and seeing how they are idiotically putting themselves into an economically disadvantageous situation by collecting huge sums of constantly inflating dollars, they will change their minds about accepting Bitcoin. At that moment, Bitcoin becomes even more valuable than before.

However, for business owners who have yet to see the light, you will only give the impression that Bitcoin is a worthless item to you that you are so willing to part ways with it as soon as you can. And a typically skeptical business owner does not wish to be fooled by you.

Maybe what you should say instead, while paying US dollars, is tell them, ""I am so glad you accept this worthless government paper instead of my Bitcoins. I get to keep my Bitcoins, thank you so much!"" and walk away with a smile.

Yeah, I agree with that, although there were some external factors, I mostly just think of them as a catalyst for the crash, but not the cause. The cause was that it was in a hype bubble.  2013 was also a bit of a hype bubble but it could have sustained for a lot longer of MtGox didn't die.  MtGox going down was a huge eternal event and eroded a lot of confidence.

"&gt;That´s wrong.

It really isn't. The removal of trust is the main part. Rather than just read the heading of the whitepaper look at what it was the result of - years and years of work to remove the need for a trusted central authority. If you stop checking and validating yourself you have to trust others. Or if you just want to look at the whitepaper and not look into what problem it was trying to solve - ask why trust and the need to remove it is mentioned so many times (14). Ask what peer-to-peer means - it doesn't mean having to trust a central party to say what's what.

&gt;your non-mining node does nothing for the network, and nobody cares if your Rasberry-PI-node says that you have money - you only have money if the other nodes say that you have money.

I care - that's the point. You don't need to trust anyone with Bitcoin. You don't 'only have money if the other nodes say you have money' - you have what your nodes says and it will agree with every other node that is in consensus (you've heard of that I assume). If someone tries to change the rules and you are all trusting the nodes of miners how are you going to ensure that your coins are on the chain that follows the consensus rules you want. You can't - you just get pulled along with what a centralised group want you to do. ",1522874120

&gt; That's your personal opinion. Many users have a diametral different opinion, and many of them are not idiots.

No. It's the most plausible and almost certainly correct deduction examining the available facts. You can have a different opinion that's less grounded in facts and more in elaborate fiction.

It seems to me, if anything, that over time it got even more volatile. What ""real shitty news"" did we receive in Jan-March, that could justify, being up to par with Mtgox 80% volume hack? What did we have that was so concerning? We had Binance FUD, China FUD, SK FUD. That's it. Coinbase wasn't hacked, neither was Bitfiniex, nothing really happened.



And we still dropped 75%. 




I actually believe that people going in the market, are now less and less required to be smart about the tech behind it. I'd argue people in the past were more so in it for the tech, than for pure speculation. This is why, new people, with no idea, buying BTC at 18000$.  



In other words, as adoption grows and tech becomes easier to use, also implies that less techy people get involved, which means a lot of weak hands will enter the deck.

"Correct, I was referring to investing in those companies via stock market. It’s really hard to say if Stellar or IBM would be the better blockchain investment. The way I look at it; IBM has other blockchain based products and services other than Stellar. Investing in these companies that are involved with crypto is essentially a safer way to invest in blockchain, as the stellar project could fail and IBM could end the partnership, and IBMs stock would be (relatively) fine. If you invest in stellar, and stellar ends up failing, then.... you’re shit out of luck. Same with investing in Apple. They’re working ok blockchain technology, and if the project fails, then you still own Apple stock which has certainly done well without blockchain projects. It’s also important to realize that buying a crypto token (ETH, BTC, XLM) is not the same as buying a stock. Sure, when we buy a token, we expect the growth of the company to create a rise in the tokens price, hence we receive a profit from selling later on, but *technically* buying a token and holding it is in no way the same as owning a share of a companies stock.

"There is no long term pattern or speculation for bitcoin.  Any attempts to do so are inaccurate.  Here why:  
  
Lets say it's January 1, 2015.  More than a year ago you saw bitcoin go on a meteoric rise to about $1200 and then crash back down to about $300.  The forecast, on January 1, 2015 was exceedingly pessimistic and negative, based on prior data.  By all indication, bitcoin was at the end and barely alive.  So why couldn't we predict the boom from 2016 to 2018 based on prior data?  Because you cannot predict the long term future of a chaotic system like bitcoin using prior market data when the prior market was never stable in the first place. 
  
Fast forward to 2018 and here we are, pretending we can see far into our crystal ball 2 years into the future when we were unable to do that on January 1, 2015?  What changed that we now have some magical insight?  Nothing of course. It's just more people spreading FOMO.  
  
But, the data isn't entirely useless.  We can make reasonable short term predictions.  For example, I can pretty safely predict that bitcoin is not going above $20k by tomorrow afternoon.  While that might be possible a few months out, it's just not going to happen overnight.  
  
With bitcoin, you can only look into the future by a few days to a few weeks.  1 week out it could be + or - about $2-3k, tops. Like it's not going to be less than $3800 or more than $9800.  2 weeks out that margin of error is even more.  1 day out it's it's probably not going to be more than $1000 +/- from where it is today.  That is the predictable volatility of bitcoin based on typical daily or weekly market swings.  
  
Now, we are also into a downturn from $20k, and that trend has been, each week on average, down.  So next week, it's probably going to be on the down side of that +/- $3000 variable.  And that's not going to change until we see an extended period (3-4 weeks) of leveling-off or going up in price. Indicating that it has either stabilized or rebounding.  ",1522871654

"I completely agree with your point of view. Businesses either need to find a sustainable business model, which is very hard in bitcoin or need to rely on donations. Only projects with very competent and passionate members like lightning labs, bitcoin core, samurai wallet, ... can survive on donations. Even Andreas Antonopoulos was having financial difficulties some weeks ago, before receiving $2MM in donations. 

In order for bitcoin to thrive, I think people should donate a small portion (say, 3%) of the money invested or earned with bitcoin. If this is not done, we won't stop having scammy ICOs and useless ERC20 tokens. I wish there was a website where people could ask funding for bitcoin-related projects.

There are several websites that list non-profit organizations that people can donate bitcoin too, like [this](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Donation-accepting_organizations_and_projects) and [this](http://donatebitcoin.info/).

Hi. You said in your AMA that you don't want a billion dollars. Can I have twenty million dollars in Bitcoin to retire and invest? I'll settle for 5 million..

I have a crippling form of schizophrenia and major clinical depression. Getting up every morning is a struggle and it's hard to live. I'm obese, my hair is falling out, I'm on Medicaid, I have erectile dysfunction as well. I'm 24 years old.

Can you please help me? If I had twenty million dollars I would invest 4 million in 3.5% return dividend stocks, put a few million in $200,000 checking accounts, invest $5 million in Google and save the rest. With that money I could buy a house, retire, live my life without working and manage my schizophrenia. I can provide proof that I have schizophrenia if you want it.

I have $40,000 in student loan debt and $1500 in credit card debt. Please help me Mark Karpeles. 

If my investment in Google turns out to be successful, I can pay you back in twenty five years after the value of the stock goes up.

"Let me ask you something, would you rather get paid in bolivars or in Bitcoin?",1522870651
"Go look at the stock market and pick any new company that has performed well over the 1 year.  Let's say they did an IPO at $25 a share (opening price) and it's currently at $250/share, or a ten-fold increase.  When placed on a logarithmic scale, where it increases from $25 to $250 to $2500, etc... you're going to see a nice steep incline from $25 to $250.  Now, knowing all that you know about how the stock market works, is going from $25 to $250 over the period of 1 year a solid indicator that it's going to be $2500 next year? Of course not.  That's insane.  But...the graph makes it look like that's going to happen.  Wrong.  The graph shows what has happened, not what will happen.  
  
When a company has an IPO, and is successful, we usually see a pretty steep increase in price over a relatively short amount of time. But of course it soon levels-off and grows at a more reasonable, not exponential growth.  The same holds true for bitcoin.  Just because it got hyped up into a bubble doesn't mean that hype is going to continue forever and ever until it (LOL) overtakes fiat.  It's going to level off at a point. So the prediction of $100,000 at 2020 is pure fantasy BS.  
  
More important is that the log scale also obfuscates major declines near the peak.  It went from $20k to now about $7k (currently less), which is more than half of price lost, yet, on the chart, it's but a pimple.  It's obfuscating the real data.  The real data is the shit was cut in half and this chart doesn't represent that reality very well.  
  
Another example for you:
  
Let's say you have a friend and they want to borrow some money.  For most of us, it's no big deal to loan anywhere from $1 to $10.  But $10 to $100 is a different matter.  Yet, why is it given the same amount of high space in a logarithmic chart?  Are we to be fooled into thinking that during the first 2 years of bitcoin, when it was priced from about $0 to $10, that it was doing anything other than stagnating and virtually worthless?  When in fact, that was very much the truth.  
  
[Put the chart on a price line from when bitcoin became somewhat popular (~$1000 near the end of 2013) to the current price and don't use a logarithmic scale.](https://i.imgur.com/glGJwUR.jpg)  What you will see is a lot less exciting and less upwardly mobile. Now, that's not to discount the fact that bitcoin made great gains during that run from 2017 to 2018, but that hype run is not indicative of the direction it's headed. The direction it's headed from the crash down from $20, is downward, not upwards.  The market indication, that is useful to investors, is that it's downwardly mobile, not upwardly mobile.  Because we can clearly see the rise and fall from $20k was an unrealistic hype bubble.  Once you scatch that shit out, then what you see is:  short term (3-6 month) speculation is downward, but long term speculation, based on prior non-hype performance, is up, but not as much as OP has made it out to be.

Coinbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of stakes.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA](http://archive.is/Prd01)) and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, ""share"" their personal data with ""3rd parties"" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**

"It's relevant because money velocity is another important Keynesian metric, as it ties directly into how much people are spending and therefore how much economic activity there is on the surface. So for a Keynesian high money velocity, aka lots of spending, is good because it stimulates aggregate demand and economic activity. 

The whole Bitcoin Cash position seems to be that if a lot of people aren't constantly spending coins on coffee and random retail stuff, it has no value and might as well be useless. Therefore fees need to be kept as low as possible so people spend more, which will somehow drive adoption. There's obvious parallels there in regards to the erroneous focus on the velocity of money as a measure of the economic system's health and growth. 

The key thing to understand is saving is just as legitimate a use and ""activity"" of a currency as spending it, and also much more foundational and important. This was one of the important Austrian insights. Bitcoin might not be the best means of exchange today (and not just because of fees, the volatility is actually the biggest factor) but as long as it remains a secure store of value it will remain useful and demanded, and can in time improve as a means of exchange as market cap increases and the technology improves. However if it's compromised as a secure store of value at any point, it will become useless as a means of exchange in an irreparable way. So potentially risking that to make it a marginally simpler means of exchange today is totally irresponsible. But that's why there's now two chains, so have at it. 

I can sympathize with Roger's feelings on the plight of many people in the world, even if the rhetoric seems over the top to me. However good intentions alone count for less than nothing. It's easy to be angry and self righteous.

"**Gaslighting**

Gaslighting is a form of manipulation that seeks to sow seeds of doubt in a targeted individual or in members of a targeted group, hoping to make them question their own memory, perception, and sanity. Using persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, and lying, it attempts to destabilize the target and delegitimize the target's belief.

Instances may range from the denial by an abuser that previous abusive incidents ever occurred up to the staging of bizarre events by the abuser with the intention of disorienting the victim. The term owes its origin to the 1938 Patrick Hamilton play Gas Light and its 1940 and 1944 film adaptations.

"&gt; when he said ""I've dumped a few hundred BTC for BCC"" and then two weeks later said ""I haven't cashed a single Bitcoin, or altcoin, or cash, or anything for Bitcoin Cash up until yesterday, and I sold like about a dozen Bitcoins for Bitcoin Cash.""

Ok, so you want to attack the guy as a complete fraud, not to mention the entire ecosystem and philosophical disagreement that lead to the first major fork of Bitcoin, simply because one comment among the thousands of hours of recorded video the guy has done flip-flops about where 0.56% of his bitcoin investments went?

Sorry, that doesn't seem to be relevant to the vast array of fraud accusations made against Roger daily, nor is it of any consequence.  There shouldn't have been any doubt which fork of Bitcoin Roger would be supporting, if anything the only surprising thing is that such a small amount of his Bitcoins were sold for BCH.

This is similar to why politicians are so frequently viewed as liars or flip-flopping.  There's thousands if not tens of thousands of hours of recorded video of them speaking to dozens of completely opposite audiences.  I think if the average person, myself included, were subjected to such scrutiny, there would be a lie somewhere there too, even if I didn't intend it or was simply confused or under pressure, or trying to speak to different audiences with subtle distinctions that would be missed without knowing my mindset at the time.

For all you know, that might not have even been an outright lie.  That's not much money with as much wealth as Roger is known to have, and his organizations and finances are large and complicated (as is true for every person with a net worth that high).  He undoubtedly has people he trusts that manage at least a portion of his coins, he might have directed someone to trade some hot wallet trading funds from BTC to BCH but never moved any cold storage funds himself to do such a trade, making both statements true in different ways.

But it doesn't even matter.  It's a small percentage(0.55% of BTC, much less of total net worth) and a small time period(2 weeks ish), and both statements are logically consistent with both his long term views(opposing Core's strategy of telling the economy to fuck off) and his views at the time(cautiously supporting BCH in small amounts while he was committed to 2x).

I could pick apart the second ""string of lies"" you linked which is even more tenuous and ridiculous, but I'll give you a chance to pick a different one that is actually solid instead.  Surely this isn't the best you have to demonstrate that Ver isn't trustworthy or is a fraud?",1522868399

"yeah, agreed. there is too much alchemical weirdness about money. its just so far from rational. there are a hundred coins that do what btc does better and more efficently at this point, but none of them have that magic something. Honestly the cultural critic in me thinks it has a lot to do with Satoshi's blessed absence, so we can't learn about him fucking the interns or screwing over his partners or whatever. Religion figured out things went a lot easier when you relegated Big Daddy to some implacable place in the sky, and I feel like BTC is proving the same point. Its more fun when you can project whatever you want to believe on the idea of somebody rather than just another sad bag of flesh. 

Eth is really a completely different thing, and its a great irony of history that something as simple as BTC lives alongside something as complicated as ETH. but I also think it will last, just because its going to take its competitors so long to match its ecosystem. Its not like facebook beating friendster and myspace, because things weren't built on top of friendster or myspace in the same way. the only hope I think is if some 2.0/3.0 blockchain arrives with a killer app already built on top of it, and this is what I would be looking at if I was running EOS or Cardano - what's my instagram I can debut at the exact same time as mainnet to drive adoption and make people use it immediately.

But that's when I just had to transcribe this quote about after that about transactions:

Mow on litecoin: ""faster block times 2.5 minutes - it's great for payments""

Roger: ""So luckily Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash already have a bigger marketshare than litecoin. You don't have to wait for a confirmation in a block for transactions to be acceptable by a merchant. So the rule, probably before you got involved in Bitcoin so you might not be aware of this, but the rule was called ""first seen first safe"", which meant as soon as you broadcasted your transaction to the network that was the transaction that the miners were going to include in the block, which made it perfectly safe for merchants all around the world to accept as soon as it was broadcasted to the network, so basically instantly, and then a bunch of people who came to Bitcoin much later started advocating for a system called Replace by Fee, which meant that you can replace the transaction with a different transaction at any point up until it is included on the block. And on the Bitcoin network its about 10 minutes average per block, on litecoin its two and half minutes, so they get all excited about it, ""well its two and a half minutes on litecoin rather than 10 minutes on Bitcoin!"", that doesn't matter one bit when you have the policy of ""first seen first safe"" which means the transactions on Bitcoin Cash are instant... Why would you want to wait around for a block when you could do it instantly? ...And that's how Bitcoin was... up until a bunch of people who came to Bitcoin later changed the way in which Bitcoin worked, and made it less usable as money for the world.""

"Imo widespread adoption is a ways off because of what happened in December and January. Bitcoin made headlines, and started pulling in investors who typically wouldn’t be interested in bitcoin, but didn’t want to miss out. Then once enough got in, bitcoin bit back and hard. The drop was amplified by new money being concerned of a sharp drop in value, causing even more selloffs.

"&gt; But because Tails routes through TOR, your traffic should remain untraceable, and any attacker would have to control all the exit nodes you selected or the full nodes you’ve connected to for any chance of fooling you. And if you can’t connect through TOR, just assume you’re under direct attack.

Except that it isn't especially hard for an attacker to MITM your Tor connection when you use Bitcoin. See ""[Bitcoin over Tor is a Bad Idea](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=7163022)"". Even if the specific attacks here *may* not directly apply to an SPV client, they do apply to the full nodes that the SPV client is *required* to trust, so this isn't much better.

&gt; merchants can be relied upon to run full nodes so long as they can accept 0-confirmation transactions, because that’s the only way to verify a transaction before miners have done so. 

Merchants are generally recommended to not allow incoming connections, in part to prevent network based attacks like Eclipse attacks. Therefore, if these merchants want to safely accept 0-conf, they won't be servicing SPV clients.

&gt; and you don’t trust that the Keynesian Beauty Contest would lead miners to orphan blocks with invalid transactions

It is worth noting that many miners do not validate transactions, historically at least. At least 51% did in July 2015, for instance. SPV clients can get screwed from this.

&gt; Full nodes are bad OpSec.

I'm sorry, but this is absurd. SPV clients have *terrible* privacy. If your SPV client connects to a law enforcement operated node, you are giving them your wallet addresses. 

&gt; In Full Node software, there’s a few orders of magnitude more code to audit.

But when you run an SPV client, you are dependent upon and trusting the full nodes you connect to. To your point, then, if you run SPV you would need to audit *both* the full node *and* the SPV client implementation...and of course, you would have to do so without dependable knowledge of what full node code to audit, since there are multiple implementations.

A few more things (and I'm sure there's more I'm not thinking of):

1) Privacy *is a security issue*, and SPV clients are opening up their wallets to the nodes they connect to.

2) SPV wallets are [more susceptible](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.09193.pdf) (PDF, reference below if you don't want to click) to Vector76 attacks. The attacking miner embeds tx1 in a block in a secret branch that he mines, sends the block to the merchant/victim directly, and then transmits conflicting tx2 to the network. Since the SPV node doesn't broadcast blocks, tx2 will be mined.

3) You trust that the nodes you connect to are following the rules that you want. A rule change that might be popular in general but that you do not support can have you following a chain that you do not want to be transacting on.

Where? Here's an actual quote from Satoshi, in a e-mail to Mike Hearn:

&gt;There is only one global chain.

&gt;The existing Visa credit card network processes about 15 million Internet purchases per day worldwide.  Bitcoin can already scale much larger than that with existing hardware for a fraction of the cost.  It never really hits a scale ceiling.  If you're interested, I can go over the ways it would cope with extreme size.
 
&gt;By Moore's Law, we can expect hardware speed to be 10 times faster in 5 years and 100 times faster in 10.  Even if Bitcoin grows at crazy adoption rates, I think computer speeds will stay ahead of the number of transactions.

https://pastebin.com/Na5FwkQ4

One global chain, meaning no Blockstream sidechains are necessary. It also means that no other network or means for transacting is necessary.

Mike Hearn is doing an AMA on tomorrow, maybe you can ask him what Satoshi meant?

Here's a few more informative quotes:

&gt;I think client-only nodes should receive full blocks so they can scan them for their own transactions.  They don't need to store them or index them.  For the initial download, they only need to download headers, since there couldn't be any payments before the first time the program was run (a header download command was added in 0.3.18).  From then on, they download full blocks (but only store the headers).

Also, referring to the blocksize limit:

&gt;A higher limit can be phased in once we have actual use closer to the limit and make sure it's working OK.
 
&gt;Eventually when we have client-only implementations, the block chain size won't matter much.  Until then, while all users still have to download the entire block chain to start, it's nice if we can keep it down to a reasonable size.
 
&gt;With very high transaction volume, network nodes would consolidate and there would be more pooled mining and GPU farms, and users would run client-only.  With dev work on optimising and parallelising, it can keep scaling up.
 
&gt;Whatever the current capacity of the software is, it automatically grows at the rate of Moore's Law, about 60% per year.

I think this is what you were looking for:


&gt;&gt;I haven't fully understood why sequence numbers are a property of the tx inputs rather than the tx itself.

&gt;It's for contracts.  An unrecorded open transaction can keep being replaced until nLockTime.  It may contain payments by multiple parties.  Each input owner signs their input.  For a new version to be written, each must sign a higher sequence number (see IsNewerThan).  By signing, an input owner says ""I agree to put my money in, if everyone puts their money in and the outputs are this.""  There are other options in SignatureHash such as SIGHASH_SINGLE which means ""I agree, as long as this one output (i.e. mine) is what I want, I don't care what you do with the other outputs."".  If that's written with a high nSequenceNumber, the party can bow out of the negotiation except for that one stipulation, or sign SIGHASH_NONE and bow out completely.
 
&gt;The parties could create a pre-agreed default option by creating a higher nSequenceNumber tx using OP_CHECKMULTISIG that requires a subset of parties to sign to complete the signature.  The parties hold this tx in reserve and if need be, pass it around until it has enough signatures.
 
&gt;One use of nLockTime is high frequency trades between a set of parties.  They can keep updating a tx by unanimous agreement.  The party giving money would be the first to sign the next version.  If one party stops agreeing to changes, then the last state will be recorded at nLockTime.  If desired, a default transaction can be prepared after each version so n-1 parties can push an unresponsive party out.  Intermediate transactions do not need to be broadcast.  Only the final outcome gets recorded by the network.  Just before nLockTime, the parties and a few witness nodes broadcast the highest sequence tx they saw.

The idea of the Lightning network, in simplistic terms, is basically making a whole separate network aside from the Bitcoin network, to relay these payments and transactions. But as stated by Satoshi, this is meant for contracts and ""high-frequency trades between a set of parties."" High-frequency would generally mean multiple trades per minute, and set of parties gets really complex beyond just a few. Now, the lightning network aims to create of network of the open contracts, can you not see the complexity and uselessness of telling people who only make one transaction per day to use this for every single transaction?",1522865164

"This might sound off topic, but I believe it's worth thinking about.

Have you ever heard the story of why Armistice Day / Veteran's Day is November 11th?  The ceasefire that ended WWI went into effect at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month of the year, which is why that day is celebrated.

The sad fact is that the ceasefire could've gone into effect earlier, but the signers chose that moment because the numbers were neat.

I don't remember the specific numbers, but some time back I saw figures for the number of people who died in WWI between the time the ceasefire was signed and the time it went into effect.  All those deaths could've been avoided, but the people orchestrating this event wanted to play cute tricks with numbers, so people died.

That's what I'm thinking of, here.  Samson Mow doesn't believe Bitcoin (in any form) is going to be usable by the poor masses of the world.  Roger Ver and I believe that it is going to be usable by everybody and that it is going to help end war.  That is why we are doing this.

"The value is the citizenship contract. I'm surprised no one understands this.  When you sign on as a citizen you accept obligation that comes with the system of money. Asset and obligation is the dual nature of the system. The obligation is so strong that assets will be taken from you to meet your obligations if you don't. A dollar is worth a dollar because a dollar's worth of stuff will be taken from you to meet the obligation is a worse case scenario. That's the only thing that gets this type of enforcement and it greatly stabilizes money to the point where it is the only standard by which to value other things. There's a reason why we are said to be societies governed by the rule of Law. The law is the tool of enforcement. Without it fools would think they could hold on to money, never circulate it and have stable value from it as someone else was crushed by the weight of the obligation tied to it.

In our societies there is only government that can impose obligation. In others it could be whoever is ruler, perhaps a warlord, but he would have to have a lot of power.

Gold is commodity in the west. I know of no government that accepts is as payment of obligation. You are stuck running to market and converting to money to meet those. 

By giving bitcoin some of the very same properties that made gold abandoned years ago what smart thing has been done? It's limited in quantity, it's not equally distributed on the globe, it is hoardable, it takes energy to source (a waste) and it projects to go up in value to exploit a desire for it. That is entirely about having world of haves and have nots. You want money to be the exact opposite of that. You want it to allow equality and combat hierarchy. Bitcoin is for greedy people who love to hold things and just watch them go up in desirability. We got closer to ideal when we moved to fiat, which knows no bounds to limit any of us to have to slave away at the hands of a holder of something that we need. We are free to borrow against our future earnings with fiat. That pisses off the hoarders of money who would much rather have you wanting what they have in hand.",1522864844

What I'm trying to get at is ... Once crypto gets to the point that users are using crypto (I should really say blockchain, sorry) without even knowing it, that's when the whole market will *truly* thrive.

VeChain I believe (yes, I'm bias) will be the first to make blockchain and crypto as a whole go mainstream without the mainstream actually knowing they're adopting and using blockchain tech - especially if the likes of DHL are looking at implementing VeChain into their business model. Soon the mainstream goats will go to their post office and ask for a postage stamp, but will get a unique QR Code instead or the option of an RFID chip for extra tracking features. Research and lightbulb moments of 'wow, blockchain really is game changing' ensue.

Am trying hard not to make this all about VeChain, as I know /r/CC for some reason dislikes it (sadface.jpg) but I truly believe VeChain is what's going to (help) dig crypto out of this rut sooner rather than later. That National level partnership where they're running VeChain in the city of Gui'an - if/when that trial is a success, they'll no doubt spread wider into China. I'm being way optimistic here, but imagine if the whole of China ran on VeChain what that would do for crypto awareness and how much FOMO other countries' governments would have seeing China's success in being turned into a smart country

"One really nice go-to example (because there is no way to construe it as anything *but* a lie) is [when he said ""I've dumped a few hundred BTC for BCC"" and then two weeks later said ""I haven't cashed a single Bitcoin, or altcoin, or cash, or anything for Bitcoin Cash up until yesterday, and I sold like about a dozen Bitcoins for Bitcoin Cash.""](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7fmvix/when_you_invite_someone_to_do_a_video_interview/dqdc44h/)

The nice thing about this example is that in the direct self-contradiction, you don't really need *any* information on what Ver actually did at the time (in other words, whether he bought or sold BCH is irrelevant; no matter what happened, *one* of his statements had to be false). Note that *even* the ""futures"" gimmick represents [Ver lying](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7fmvix/when_you_invite_someone_to_do_a_video_interview/dqdh3ff/), so there's really no way to wriggle out of this one: Ver lied, and then rather than honorably admitting his lie later on when he was called out and apologizing for it, he doubled down and lied again.

"&gt; the hopes of becoming a millionaire in just a few years.

So many more people have singlehandedly destroyed their chances of being a millionaire in their 60's by not diversifying their portfolio and ""investing"" in speculative bubbles on well intentioned hopes of being a millionaire in a few years. You hear a lot about the successes, the guy who bought at $1 and sold at $20k, and less about the failures, the guy who bought at $20k and is still holding at $7k. In order for someone to win, someone else needs to be holding the bag, but someone holding the bag is not going to be bragging about it online.

This does not mean that you remove speculative investments from your portfolio, it means that you build a balanced portfolio of investments around them. Your talk of ""diversifying into stocks down the road"" is scary because that means you've got 100% of your investments in something volatile, like Crypto. 

Sure you could be lucky and buy before a run and sell right at the tip of it, but those points are only obvious in hindsight. When it is dropping, it feels like it will never stop, when it is rising, it feels the same. When do you buy? When do you sell?

Having a portfolio of something crazy aggressive like 30% crypto, 60% stocks and 10% bonds, diversifying within those percentages so you are not in one coin/market and rebalancing on a set schedule regardless of what the market is doing will be much better than having 100% in anything.

In 3 months (of whatever your rebalance schedule is) if crypto has done well so it is now 50% of your portfolio while stocks have shit the bed to 40% of your portfolio and bonds stayed at 10%, you sell 20% of your crypto to bring you back to 30% of your portfolio and use that 20% to buy stocks to bring you back up to 60%. 

Crypto might keep going up, so you are giving up some profits there, but you don't know so at least in the meantime you've taken your crypto gain and put it into something that is down, so when stocks come back that 20% is doing work there.

It isn't sexy, but it gives you a much better chance of a good return at the sacrifce of maybe not having the best return (but only in hindsight). Doesn't even need to be stocks on bonds as your alternate items, just things that are unrelated to Crypto soif one goes down the other doesn't necessarily follow.",1522863172

"&lt;Rant

That Crypto-Keynsian / Crypto-Austrian spiel was the stupidest horse shit I've heard in a long time, and I've heard a lot of stupid shit in my day. I was hoping Ver would hit back a bit harder, but I guess it took him a bit by surprise. Such a silly argument is difficult to counter, it's just way too far off base.

Keynes was all about ""aggregate demand"" and how to stimulate it by manipulating the money supply in various ways. His theories were discredited many times, but most dramatically and in a real way during the stagflation of the 1970's, which was a phenomenon contradicted by keynesian economics - inflation should boost demand by stimulating ""aggregate demand"". Really retarded shit on the face of it, but central banks and governments love it because there's nothing they love more than control of the economy - which is why we're still living with this economy destroying garbage after nearly 100 years.

Austrians, on the other hand, base their theories on human action and basic common sense reflections, rather than preposterous mathematical models where the base unit ""utils"" is so laughably absurd that the whole system falls apart at the most superficial analysis, and falls apart more, the deeper you get, kinda like dissecting manure ""On the surface it's shit, the deeper you get it's still shit."" 

OK, you're thinking, fine. But what does this have to do with bitcoin vs bitcoin cash? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. The point, I guess, if there is one, is related to ""velocity of money"". The idea being that the higher the velocity, the lower the value. Velocity is a measure of how much money is changing hands. The basic idea behind the theory is that if money is shitty and losing value all the time, then it will be ""burning a hole in your pocket"" and you'll want to spend it really quickly just to be rid of it. This is also unrelated to the BCH vs BTC debate, because clearly, at the limits, if you can't spend the money it is worthless shit, and if you are just dumping it you won't be able to trade it for anything.

"Money is a very specific thing. It's universal standard of value in a country. It does not go to market to find its value, unless it acts as a commodity outside of its borders. It is given it's value by obligation. Only government can manage that on behalf of everyone. It can hire private entities to manage that for them too.

Trading ""as money"" is essentially saying that you can exchange with it. You can very well exchange the ability that money has to meet government obligation in secondary markets with other commodity holders. That is saying that money can be ""as commodity"" too. Bitcoin, which is commodity, will thus trade as money that trades as commodity. I do not argue with that statement because its circular. Commodity isn't money though. Only one thing serves as universal standard of value. Bitcoin is valued in that standard in exchanges, and it is not money that gets altered in price by Bitcoin sales.

There were other exchanges, but lots of them had been hacked - it was a weird time - and MtGox seemed as good as any other and being the largest exchange it seemed safer than most.

In the end, I lost 3.1 BTC - which was what was in transit at the time.   And if that seems like an insane amount of money, my recollection at the time was that it was worth about $800 or so.

"Ant-n, I don't know how to properly, and without making you feel like it's your fault, express how tired I am of these sorts of debates (as I said, it's down to my history in /r/ancap, even though you posit it's not the best place to debate such matters), most of all because they're **always** exactly the same, with the same arguments, and they also tend to end the same way. Way back then (and I'm talking previous to my creating this account), I even had a folder on my computer with a compilation of all the academic research pointing out the extremely common fallacies in the ideology... want to guess how many people actually debated back with actual sources?

Through a series of years, I could only count them on one hand. 

But alas, let me pick a representative phrase in the interest of making this as brief as possible, and then taking it from there:


&gt; I would add that socialism has no proven to be sustainable either.. even moderate form of socialism lead countries to have chronic deficit, meaning one generation pay its privileges/benefits by leaving immense debt to the next generation.

Here, as well as all throughout your comments it seems you believe the world is divided between ""Socialism"", and ""anarchism""; when in reality the opposite of ""anarchism"" is ""Statism"", and not really ""socialism"". At any rate, there aren't any truly socialist states in the world right now, and there have never been. This coupled with the fact that you seem to attempt to ""defeat"" socialism by assuming that's something I'm proposing, and I'm simply not. But to humour you...

Frankly, citing communist Cuba or Venezuela, or the USSR which I assume are what you refer to when you mean ""socialism"" (in its pure form), is a bit of a disservice to your argument, because I don't think any historian right now actually considers any of those actually ""socialist"", in a Marxist way, states. They are/were ideologically-justified dictatorships and totalitarian states, that have had little to do with their economic system beyond what flavour of propaganda they chose to control the masses. 

Secondly, and even if we were to take your example to heart, I would point out that the closest examples to ""pure free market capitalism"", and ""Marxist socialism"", we have in the current world, are the US on the one end, and Scandinavian countries on the other. You may not remember this, but we've debated about this before, and you told me (unless I'm misremembering) your personal story about being French but having chosen to move to the US on account of not considering fair what you had to pay in taxes in France. We ended up that discussion with me concluding that it was perfectly fair for there to be a diversity of systems in the world to choose from, and that you were free to pay less taxes for the privilege of (for instance) being able to be left without healthcare if you so desired (and without having to pay for it); but I also pointed out the sad situation that is that you cannot recognise that thanks to a far more egalitarian state in which you grew up, you had the chance and choice to study, and be in a position to emmigrate in the first place, a luxury that people born in the US to disprivileged families simply absolutely do not have. I seem to remember you not valuing ""equality"" as a worthwhile measure of a succesful human system, but I may be wrong. I will absolutely argue that equality is absolutely essential in terms of minimising as much as possible the suffering for human kind. 

Which brings me to my next point regarding your citing the ""fairness of the free market"": It absolutely, unmistakenly, and evidently, **is not so**. A truly free market tends towards oligopolies and progressive concentration of wealth, passing through the mechanisms of regulatory  capture, amongst others. As I said this is unquestionable in all the breath of economic literature, as it's painfully obvious in the world around you, which makes me seriously wonder why you can't see it. Which market has better internet access offerings, the American or the European one? Which one is more regulated?

And so on and so forth. I'm absolutely willing to debate this based on evidence, but as I said, I'm a bit dismayed at the notion that we disagree on such fundamentally obvious matters. A free market is not fair.

Yes, bitcoin is a well-designed system, and therein lies its genius; but just to cite that as some supporting argument for anarchy is a bit disingenuous, unless you explain exactly how those ""incentives"" will be laid out so as to favour constructive behaviours. Bitcoin is a payment system, anarchy is a proposal for a whole political system. There is no ""mining blocks"" equivalent for society at large. Let me explain:

&gt; The solutions is to don’t create bad incentives with naive law (even though they come from good intent they can be counterproductive)

OK, cool; I actually agree here, as do many countries that we should consider amongst the most socialist. Marijuana is legan in the Netherlands for quite a while now; it has nothing to do with the economic system (you're creating a false dichotomy and a straw man argument in one). But just saying ""not forbidding drugs creates the right incentives"", is far, far, far from a comprehensive incentives mechanism that disfavours psychopathic behaviours. How does not forbidding drugs make my neighbour not wish to raid my house in search of all the gold he knows I have? It all feels like handwaving and blind trust in very, very vague notions to me, and to date, nobody has been able to lay down exactly what these fantastically utopic policies would be, and who would possibly enforce them.

Now, if you are a small time guy like me, and you have bills, seeing you lose your 10k when you have bills suddenly becomes a big deal. If you got 5k in the market, and 5k in bitcoin, loss is loss and you panic and pull your investments out because it's sinking, regardless of the status of bitcoin.

You are making the assumption that people are buying for HODL and really they are buying to make money today, because bills are due today. 

Does that make any sense? My point is TLDR that investors are investors, and it doesn't matter what the stock or currency is. They invest to make money, and if the market bears, so does the currency. The whole concept of 'if the markets tank currency will not' is complete fallacy. The first thing someone does when they need money is sell crypto to pay rent. If the market crashes, crypto will head right there with it.",1522863041

Personally I think there needs to be better groundwork laid by governments to regulate exchanges but it's hard when we're in a global space of trading with a bunch of different laws in different places.  Bitgrail has left a bad mark on nano even though it appears to be a decent crypto.  The security aspect to wallets needs more wide spread info and adoption.  It's tough to try and pull from grassroots info systems like Reddit and youtube.  If you had a friend or actual place you could go to for help and it would greatly grow adoption.",1522862968

I agree that the technology is amazing.

There is zero added bonus, and well, people are lazy. Just as Apple Pay failed to gain enough marketshare, but was a great idea, so too will be bitcoin. 

Everytime I watch the videos with people talking about global currency, one thing strikes me as odd. They keep talking as if the United States and global economies are going to suddenly collapse, and go to war, and dollars will be worthless. Here is the thing. If I am in America, and the thing collapses, Dollars will be very valuable in America because nobody will have any. We will all be on bread lines and looking for spare change. Electronic currency will be of little to no value because the first thing people do when there is a problem is allow ""ONLY CASH"". Not Credit, Bitcoin, or any other currency. I think the same fo the Euro or Brit Pound. If you are living in those countries and things go bad, having Pounds on hand is where the wealth is, not electronic currencies.

"&gt; The spam issue has always seemed to be a joke to me. If your product is built to make money from usage and someone can attack it by using it, you need to fix your product.

Agreed, and this is something I noticed years ago. Bitcoin does not have perfectly aligned incentive structures. Miners can fabricate transactions and fee's to game the system, resulting in higher costs to the end users.

But this is where the irony sets in. The people on the bigger block/BU/Bcash/bicoinxt side have notoriously supported mining cartels. *The same mining cartels caught red handed manipulating the fee market by spamming the blockchain*.

&gt;I invest in other cryptos because they appear to have already solved these problems or are solving them in the near future according to their roadmaps (Plasma, Sharding, etc).

How does Plasma and Sharding fix the fee incentivization issue? I could understand if one made the argument that DAG systems fix it by literally removing the blockchain and miners all together (though I think these systems wont hold value over time), but not blockchain assets.

&gt;So yeah, I stick by my assertion that these theories of attacks on Bitcoin by deep pocketed fraudsters sound ridiculous to me.

Demonetization and perceived discrimination is a widespread issue among content creators 

Whether the shooters claims of being targeted are true or not, it's beside the point, because in a decentralized system there isn't any single authority that could possibly be blamed for any kind of selective censoring or demonetization.

"Depends on what you mean by ""no chance"". Like, if you put Coss head-to-head vs. Binance, you're absolutely right. Coss will probably never touch Binance in terms of volume. 

But think about how much money there is out there that cryptocurrencies could capture. There are TRILLIONS of USD circulating throughout the world, and crypto is just beginning. With how much money could flow into crypto in the next few years (and beyond), there's going to be a lot of room for a lot of exchanges to grab part of the market share. 

To give an example, HitBTC's 24-hour volume according to CMC right now is about $200 million. And HitBTC isn't even that great of an exchange. And we're in a bearish market where volume is pretty low. If COSS was handling $200 million of volume, coinholders would earn 2 cents per coin per week of trading dividends. And the coin itself would be valued around $18+. That's extremely feasible! Again, we're in a bearish market. Back in December, trading volume was almost four times higher.

What is Bitcoin in a nutshell

Small wonder that Bitcoin emerged in 2008 just after Occupy Wall Street accused big banks of misusing borrowers’ money, duping clients, rigging the system, and charging boggling fees. Bitcoin pioneers wanted to put the seller in charge, eliminate the middleman, cancel interest fees, and make transactions transparent, to hack corruption and cut fees. They created a decentralized system, where you could control your funds and know what was going on.

Bitcoin has come far in a relatively short time. All over the world, companies, from REEDS Jewelers, a large jewelry chain in the US, to a private hospital in Warsaw, Poland, accept its currency. Billion dollar businesses such as Dell, Expedia, PayPal, and Microsoft do, too. Websites promote it, publications such as Bitcoin Magazine publish its news, forums discuss cryptocurrency and trade its coins. It has its application programming interface",1522860551
"&gt; How does Bitcoin script always halt [...]

Bitcoin script always halt by design, because we don't want a node to get stuck processing a transaction forever. If someone manages to place script that never halts inside a transaction, it will DoS every node that tries to validate that transaction.

&gt;  and how is halting a problem?

It is a problem because by definition, a Turing complete system must be able to do everything a Turing machine does, and Turing machines can run forever (even with finite tape), thus a system that always halt can't be TC.

&gt; Isn't a TM supposed to be able to simulate the logic of an algorithm?

It is much stronger than that: Turing machine is the very formal definition of an algorithm. People had the notion of algorithm since much earlier in mathematics (the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) is an ancient algorithm, for instance), but the notion was only been formalized by Church and Turing in the 20th century.

&gt; How are the physical attributes of the machine related to this at all?

Don't understand, TC's are not physical, they are a mathematical concept. Every TM must be able to be encoded in every TC system, by definition of what a TC system is.

&gt; It seems to me like you're trying to redefine what a TM is. I mean, take a TM that outputs bananas. No known programming language can output bananas, thus Turing completeness is impossible.

I said a machine that never stops. TM's may not be able to output bananas, but there are a infinite number of TM's that never stops (and CSW said as much as himself in the paper). Take the following code in Python (which is TC):

    while True: pass

this code is perfectly finite (18 characters), uses a finite amount of tape, and never halts.

&gt; Take your never halting TM, e.g. one that calculates all the digits of pi. How is it going to get by with a finite tape?

Just because your example of TM does need infinite tape (it does, for the digits of pi are not periodic), doesn't mean there aren't non-halting TMs that works with finite tapes (like my Python code above). But tape size is irrelevant: neither my example or yours can be encoded in Bitcoin script, while every TC system can be programmed to calculate all digits of pi, and that program takes a finite amount of code.",1522860540

In my opinion, most investors don’t benefit from taking on unsystematic risk. If the history of the stock market tells us anything, most investors are really bad at beating the market. Over the last 15-year period, 95% of active funds failed to beat index funds.

I built a bot that does this automatically for me on Binance and rebalances my portfolio every month.

Also, who is to say that if they give it back to the investors, they won't sell at their first opportunity to get FIAT?

The story is a little bit more complicated than that. Mark always used the excuse of banking problems. He implicitely promised me I would be able to sell my 5 mil worth of btc and get my money. After I sent them to him and converted into USD, it was suddenly no longer possible. My lawyer told me to freeze his bank accounts, but I said no cause I didn’t want to bring Mtgox down (I know it would have). This is all provable with emails. So I actually put the community above my own (5 mil) interest at that point, because 1 week later mtgox went belly up anyway and if I would have filed my claim and frozen his accounts the week before that, I would have been before any other creditor and would have recovered my 5 mil much easier. After that I converted back to btc and exited at 20% of original value through bitcoinbuilder. And yes, I originally claimed the difference between those amounts cause I felt Mark was responsible for making false promises and luring me in, but later I realized that this money would come from other creditors so I didnt press my claim after it was rejected. I still fully intend to sue Mark personally to recover my money, but at least it won’t be coming from anyone else.

* Ripple currently partnering with &gt; 100 companies who are trialling Ripple's various Platforms
* Some major companies, including Santander, Western Union, SBI and lots others too
* There is an existing Use Case for Ripple's software - used today
* XRP's platforms come with a cost saving over and above existing X-Border transactions using the Swift Network
* Ripple Futures will enable banks to hedge any price risk, should the attempt to buy and hold XRP (i.e. use XVIA for settlements, rather than XRapid)
* The Ripple team is, along with the IOTA team, the only one with more than a hundred established and tenured Industry professionals
* Their CEO and 'C' level team are very professional and well connected
* The XRAPID Platform actually supports equivalent of [XRP BuyBacks](https://np.reddit.com/r/Ripple/comments/881net/the_secret_genius_plan_to_raise_the_xrp_price/) -- which can increase the XRP demand and hence supply
* Social benefits -- Reducing fees in X-Border transactions for Economic Migrants
* 24M USD donation to charitable causes
* Freeing up of several trillion USD in nostro/vostro accounts, that can circulate into the wider economy

**Reasons Against:**

* Some 'holier than tho' ""Experts"" on the CryptoCurrency Reddit Forum will tell you that it is not decentralised
* Some immature people will liken this to the 'bankers coin' without explaining that whilst benefitting banks due to operational efficiencies and cost savings, it's actually the wider population that will benefit

Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly (don't watch too much porn with the same pc you are dealing with btc, or don't play those stupid mobile games on the same mobile you have a btc wallet)

Out of over 20 students, only the teacher and one other student has heard of it. And remember. More and more people are hearing about it by the day.

The tricky part is that I believe an opinion came out that if you trade crypto for crypto, the IRS looks at it as two transactions, selling crypto A for fiat, and then immediately buying crypto B with the proceeds from the sale of crypto A.

"Thank you for your reply.

I hope that your trial and Vinnik's trial in the US will allow everyone to get a crystal clear picture of how everything happened exactly. WizSec's presentation was great, but so many questions remain.

For what it's worth, I hold no grudge against you anymore and your behavior recently has been exemplary. I sincerely hope that the time you served in jail already will cover your possible sentence. When I put myself in your shoes, I don't think that I could have coped with the extraordinary amount of pressure and doubt you've had to live with for so long. I'd probably be a depressed recluse or a fugitive.

The consequences of your oversights and poor decisions were mind-bogglingly huge, but in my opinion, you've paid enough for those oversights and poor decisions already. These actions or lack of actions should be looked at in vacuum, not through the lens of the suffering that resulted in part from them.

I didn't dispute the rejection because it wasn't a significant amount of money, because the procedure seemed complex, because I didn't have much evidence and because I always viewed this transfer at the 11th hour as a gamble that didn't pan out.

I only mentioned it because I was really surprised that the trustee didn't work with a database that included these deposits. I can understand why the deposit might not have been added to my account automatically with the site down, but I would've expected the trustee to do it or to freeze the bank account and have all deposits sent back.

I wish you the best of luck and sincerely hope that you'll be able to live in peace after the trial and the potential lawsuits that might follow.

"The spam issue has always seemed to be a joke to me.  If your product is built to make money from usage and someone can attack it by using it, you need to fix your product.

I'm holding my BTC because I hope it can fix these shortcomings.  I invest in other cryptos because they appear to have already solved these problems or are solving them in the near future according to their roadmaps (Plasma, Sharding, etc).  

I continually re-evaluate, so my investments are subject to change according to mostly technology advancements or failures.  Rarely do the conspiracy theories factor into my investment decisions.  

For example, Craig S. Wright could decide tomorrow that he's been wrong all along and now supports only BTC.  It won't change my mind about BTC by one bit.   Then if Roger Ver suddenly decides BTC and Lighting are the holy grail of crypto and he was wrong all along, I still don't give a crap.  I'm not selling my BTC.  Likewise, the drama between BTC and BCH zealots don't push my money one way or the other either.

So yeah, I stick by my assertion that these theories of attacks on Bitcoin by deep pocketed fraudsters sound ridiculous to me.

"Well I think SM does work on a limited simulation model, so many people get tricked into thinking this is an actual model of a Bitcoin network.  The real Bitcoin network is an economic game theoretic system, and you cannot really simulate that.  Plus   [As csw says](https://www.yours.org/content/the-cancer-in-bitcoin-e75381d0fd75):

&gt; In fact, a large number of the existing miner community will just black list you if you tried this… So, you start this attack, you start causing the honest miners to orphan blocks, and they will just sit and lose money. This is the crux of this trickery.

&gt; It is the idea that all miners are stupid other than the dishonest ones. Painting miners as evil has become a hobby as painting any capitalist as evil is the corresponding norm.

&gt; The selfish miner strategy leads to a loss of up to 33% or more of direct revenue. Profit is only a fine margin for most miners, so this is a huge loss. 

&gt; The entire argument is that miners will make incredible losses to show a small increase in perceived hash rate.

&gt; Using an attack that is simple to detect. In fact, it is impossible NOT to detect. It is the most stupidly obvious and simple to block attack ever devised.

So if the attack were to happen it would be noticed and other players in the system would react.  These simulations take no account into other players in the system and their reactions to selfish mining.  It does not take account the real network topology which is commonly mistaken as a mesh network as [forkius maximus explains in this article](https://www.yours.org/content/craig-wright-s--negative-gamma--and-the-curious-lack-of-intellectual-c-191f72455730).

"&gt;I think you're a low effort troll and you're full of shit basically every time you open your mouth.

That's nice and all, but not what I was asking about. In any case, I'm not trying to promote BCH, so my own reputation isn't going to do it any harm through association, as you are arguing CSW's does.

&gt;I haven't found any convincing proof of any lies that Roger told that are both 1) relevant to issues at hand, 2) objective facts, 3) on an issue that matters, 4) not attributable to human mistakes, and 5) provable beyond reasonable doubt.

There are about 20 that I just provided proof of, so if you take the time to read through what I just linked you to, you'll find plenty of examples. It's unclear what you mean by ""the issues at hand"" and ""an issue that matters"", because the subject right now is simply ""people with provable histories of lying (and whether or not them being liars is doing harm to BCH)""... you originally made a very compelling case about Wright in this context, and I asked you whether you felt the same about Roger Ver's influence (who has been caught lying just as many times as Wright has, as you can see from my links).

You'll notice (if you do take the time to look it over) that many of the lies I provided proof to include explanations for why they cannot be mere ""mistakes"" and are, in fact, accompanied by proof beyond any reasonable doubt. Each of your 5 listed criteria are met here, many times over.

&gt;I've written elsewhere that I'm not a huge fan and don't personally trust him

Well, that's good to know. I suppose that at least partially answers my question. I suppose it is fair to say that you *don't* believe he is harming BCH through reputational association, though.

&gt; but he's simply not comparable to CSW

I'm not sure I follow you on this one. They seem comparable (in more ways than one) to me.

We have a few more examples of direct lies that Ver has told, and the nature of the lies (most of the time) are different, but both of these men are relatively famous in this space, both aggressively promote BCH on a regular basis and are associated with it at this point, and both of them are proven liars, so they seem quite comparable in the respects that are relevant to this particular discussion.

&gt;I find him to be more honest than... assholes such as yourself.

Perhaps that is a result of you refusing to read the documented lies that he has told. You seem to dislike me (likely as a result of the fact that I have thoroughly and methodically explained errors in your reasoning on multiple separate occasions at this point) so much that you are willing to accuse me of dishonesty and lying *even without having any examples of me doing so*, while outright refusing to acknowledge a long list of examples of Ver doing so. This is logically inconsistent in obvious ways, and highly irrational.

&gt;If you think anyone with half a brain is going to actually dig through that steaming pile of garbage you linked, you're a moron.

I can't force you to read facts that you don't want to read, but they're there if you're interested in learning the truth. There are links there to give you direct access to everything you need to know to verify what is being explained; the proof is bundled in.

&gt;If you want to convince people of something, link to something directly relevant,

I just did. Again, the conversation here is about CSW being a liar, and the potential harm this is doing to BCH by association; I asked you whether you think that Roger Ver being a liar might have a similar effect, and gave you access to a long list of instances of Roger Ver lying (replete with accompanying proofs). Again, I can't force you to read it, but it's there, just in case you want to dig into the matter.

&gt;I know you think you're on the side of right

Well, in this case, the proof of correctness is included in the links provided. I'm not talking about Satoshi, Core, or even Bitcoin here; those aren't particularly relevant to this specific discussion.

"I think you completely misunderstand. These papers show that the assumption, that Bitcoin is secure if &gt;50% of the miners are honest, is wrong. 

Whether a selfish mining attack is likely to happen in practice is a completely different topic and depends on how many miners are honest.
None of these papers say anything about whether they are honest or not. But they do show that a large rational miner or mining pool has an incentive to execute such an attack.

&gt;Certainly there are blind miners who will go wherever profits flow strongest, but as we've seen - when a pool gets too big people start yelling ""you idiots! You want a warehouse full of scrap metal?! Switch pools!!"", and then magically, everything reverts to equilibrium.

This is exactly why selfish mining (and double-spending through block withholding) is relevant. Without the paper by Eyal and Sirer, people assumed that an honest majority is enough, i.e. they would only be concerned if a mining pool has more than 50% of the mining power.

&gt; The company Midex, which offers international crypto-currency exchange services, carried out a social experiment in which several employees, who were being hired by different companies around the world, were offered the option of receiving their salaries in crypto-currencies.

&gt; Overall, the study found that 36% of the workers were willing to accept a portion of the salary with cryptocurrencies; while 2 of the employees agreed to accept the entire salary with those assets.

&gt; Of course, the volatility factor can work both ways: on the one hand, as with any investment, there is the risk of loss, but on the other hand, with the increase in the value of a given cryptocurrency, the employee could see his or her salary increase in a short time.

It is interesting how similar to life, once we get used to certain things, then the perspective changes. 

Similarly, right now, we can't imagine BTC being at 1000 dollars.  Why?  Because we feel like in our April 2018 mindset that if somehow BTC was at 1000, everyone and their moms would buy BTC propelling the upward launch.

Why??? These papers are stupid because they assume that all miners are complete idiots who choose a pool based on profit alone. If you'd ever tried to mine bitcoin you would know that this is simply not true.
Choosing a pool is big decision and there are tons of little trade offs you have to think about. Profitability is one of them obviously, but it's NOT on top of the list. 

What is on top of the list for a large percentage of miners?? The question ""is the pool operator a shady motherfucker who's going to try to pull some bullshit?"" &lt;---- that's my number one

Certainly there are blind miners who will go wherever profits flow strongest, but as we've seen - when a pool gets too big people start yelling ""you idiots! You want a warehouse full of scrap metal?! Switch pools!!"", and then magically, everything reverts to equilibrium.

It's not naive to think that this is how miners will continue to act in the future. Saying selfish mining is a danger is like saying you shouldn't fly on a plane because the airline might be able to make more money by intentionally crashing! Possible that this is true?? Absolutely.

Interesting.

&gt;I don't want this. I don't want this billion dollars. From day one I never expected to receive anything from this bankruptcy. The fact that today this is a possibility is an aberration and I believe it is my responsibility to make sure it doesn’t happen. **One of the ways to do this would be civil rehabilitation, and as it seems most creditors agree with this, I am doing my best to help make it happen.** I do not want to become instantly rich. I do not ask for forgiveness. I just want to see this end as soon as possible with everyone receiving their share of what they had on MtGox so everyone, myself included, can get some closure.

"I agree. With bitcoin and other cryptos **you are your own bank** with all implied rights and responsibilities: **your** crypto cannot be stolen or seized as long as **you** secure it the right way.

Eventually you will leave on your exchange whatever you may want to trade and in a cold wallet what you want to hodl for a while.

For physical cold wallets, if you have enough bitcoins to justify the investment, I would go for the Ledger (my preferred) or Trezor.

The key thing when you have a cold wallet is to have a copy of your seed or private key kept in a safe place, in a separate location, that no one but you (or a person you trust enough) can access. This could be a plastified printout in a personal safe, a metal plate, or an encrypted file on a differently encrypted partition of a HDD...

&gt; The selfish miner strategy leads to a loss of up to 33% or more of direct revenue. Profit is only a fine margin for most miners, so this is a huge loss.

"I expect that your reply to this will be along the lines of 'it was always theirs', but have you considered how your ideal plan (returning the original BTC to creditors), however unlikely it is, is just rewarding people for their own ineptitude?

I'm sure you will agree that holding a large number of coins on an exchange in the first place was a foolish exercise, and if your plans come to fruition you will have made some people very wealthy not just because of the first mistake of leaving the coins sat on Gox, but also by forcing them to 'hodl'. 

If Gox had never happened, the vast majority of your creditors would have traded away, wasted and sold their BTC over the years. You would now be returning BTC to them and instantly making many of them extremely rich, by virtue of their own incompetence.

I'd say businesses/institutions will be the major adopter of cryptocurrencies. Smart contracts have the potential to create a lot of efficiencies that businesses and institutions can take advantage of.

I imagine it will start with companies/institutions using private blockchains to improve their own internal systems (since for the most part nobody wants to risk things on a public blockchain). Then they will find they can improve things more by interacting with other company/institutional's private blockchains (that data is useful afterall). Having the interactions between these private chains is where a public blockchain will come in and facilitate these interactions (just like how the internet isn't just a few private intranets between a few companies). This is why I'm going big on interoperability blockchains (ICX, AION, WAN) and smart contract platforms (ETH, NEO).",1522854646

"you are overlooking very important details here. for one, the price of BTC would drop so much that even if they found a way to double spend thier own transaction they still have no clue how much value that will be once they get the coins on the market. They cannot change previous blocks, and I dont believe they can change the wallet address of the other transactions in the currernt block. IF they doublespent a transaction, it is very likely it would be detected almost immediately, and they would have to somehow get thier btc from the wallet they double spent on, into an exchange which would have to wait at least 10 minutes(for the next block) while the prices on the exhange plummet to incredibly low prices because everyone is anticipating a huge dump of double spent coins. so they will only get a fraction of the value they ""stole"" because price would drop before they could offload it onto the market. *furthermore* any individual who has accrued the kind of wealth it would take to gain control of more than 51% of the hash power is likely an incredibly savvy businessperson, and they probably consistently make good decisions regarding the use of capital to generate returns long term and short term.  they are likely able to do math, likely able to see that they have an incredible resource with great potential for producing profits well into the future with a huge market advantage since they have accrued so much hardware that is only used for securing the BTC network and **literally** nothing else. They would realize that manipulating the blockchain would lead to a destruction of value of all the hardware they have and all the BTC they have. its just incribly counterproductive for any one actor to do that.   
  
having said all this, obviously im not pushing for 1 miner to control majority of the hash rate. OBVIOUSLY it would be better if 10 or more companies were vying for something like 80% of the has rate, but thats not the case. Im just not ready to go to code red, nuclear option and ""brick"" all the ASICs and give a big middle finger to every miner who secures the BTC network. If you change the algorithm you will likely never see a return to the hash power that we currently have, which means BTC would never be as safe as it was yesterday. there are more factors to consider than just, ""I dont like bitmain....... 51% attak!!!""

"Have you ever bought a wallet in a physical store. I mean truly there will be hundreds on display. Some cheap, some expensive. I’ve even seen some free and they are still on the shelf. Free ones still on the shelf. And all of them are basically from an open source design. Better yet look at Women’s purses. It’s even more competitive on that front. 

The issue with free bitcoin wallets is developers have all these ideas that can’t be done because you can’t capitalize on it because it’s open source. The reality is if you get people to pay for it the devs will try to dictate to users on what is good for them. Like offering shitcoins or doing an ICO. 

As for pricing, even at $0.99 you can still build a product. If a competitor comes out with a cheaper one then so be it. If you offer more value and support then no user will leave. Build a product that has pricing power is all I ask. Support the product that a user pays for. I’m serious if your wallet leads to the use of LN and includes features for a premium like in app purchases for coins I’d pay for that. Even if it involves open source software.

When was the last time you bought a coffee and thought “yeah, cash is great, but I wish I could spend the Alibaba stocks I own like it was currency and then file capital gains with the IRS...”

Personally I believe BTC, ETH, ADA, etc. will appreciate because they are either stores of value or provide utility for programming platforms. XLM and XRP (both of which I hold) I have my doubts about, because the goals of investors are at odds with the goals of the developers. Investors want it to appreciate but the devs want it to be used in daily transactions. 

I like the inflation built into XLM but I don’t think 1% is enough. People on the forum cite inflation as a negative of using fiat but from a behavioral sciences standpoint, it is a powerful tool. The government is motivating people to re-circulate their money back into the economy through spending and investment, rather than hoarding an appreciating asset.

Suppose its the year 2140, all Butcoins have been mined and the float sets Bitcoin's price at 100.000,00 USD each. This means the total marketcap is 21.000.000,00 Bitcoins times 100.000,00 USD, totaling to 21 trillion dollars. But we just learned half of these Bitcoins are lost and can never be reclaimed. So the practical number of Bitcoins are 10.500.000,00. These are all almost traded on a daily basis, having the float set the price of Bitcoin at 100.000,00 USD, as Bitcoin is now usable as a currency. This means the practical marketcap is 10.5 trillion dollars. So you can see the TOTAL market cap is telling a lie while the practical market cap is telling a more real value.

"Let me see if I can condense this charlatan's ramblings into a coherent thesis:

1. In Bitcoin, every node (miner) connects to every other node (miner). This produces a nearly complete graph (every node connects to every other node).
2. Non-generating nodes can be disregarded from this analysis because they don't produce blocks.
3. Lightning Network will never produce a complete graph because creating edges costs money.
4. LN can be attacked by DOSing highly-connected nodes.
5. DOSing a miner, in contrast, can't bring down the Bitcoin network because the each one connects to all the others.

So what?

Although he never comes out and says it directly, Wright seems to be driving at the idea that unconfirmed transactions can be made secure at the consensus level. At least this is what he's said in other settings.

In particular, miners will refuse to build on blocks containing mempool double spends.

Never mind that the entire purpose of the block chain is to solve this problem.

If implemented, Wright's scheme opens the Bitcoin Cash network up to some nasty new timing attacks. For example, miner A can sabotage the block of miner B by ensuring that a single transaction reaches them last. When miner B publishes its block, it will be rejected by the hash rate majority.

Absolutely not as a group and certainly not from anyone in a position to speak for the group. They all rejected it and multiple Core developers are on record as likely to halt all code contributions should S2X become the dominant chain. There was never any BIP for S2X.

"Right now most of the features that are useful (aside from use as currency) are under development so the ""buzzwords"" judgement isn't incorrect. However the team is competent at developing the platform and the ideas they are implementing have been proven to work by demo apps on the platform (ACES etc). Once it's ready it is going to be a great platform for devs as an alternative to Ethereum.
I can mention some points that interest me as a developer:
- Ark's main chain is VM-less which means it's not bloated by third party apps such as crypto kitties. It's purpose is to facilitate on chain and inter chain transactions using encoded listeners (referred to as ""smart bridges"").
- Smartbridges are a particular use case of time-locked multisig transactions so everything is done in a trust less manner.
- Ark implements a DPoS consensus mechanism with a weighted vote. Only one delegate can be voted by each ark staked which rules out the possibility of cartels that have formed in other chains. We're seeing similar staking pools arising in Ethereum as well which signifies a convergence towards a possibly optimum system.
- Delegates are voted in by holders of ark. Different delegates offer different contributions to the ecosystem. Some are marketing, some are developing code. At the moment delegates offer somewhere between 85-95 % of the mining rewards to voters in addition to these contributions.
- Each dapp in the ark ecosystem will run on it's own blockchain with it's own delegates. So no rent for developers. Also no need to worry about crypto kitties wrecking the network and disabling your dapp.

As an investor you may want to wait until the v2 is released if you don't want to take the high risk associated with software projects. Especially since Ark has a policy of giving no dates on their road map which can be frustrating as an investor. Of course the entry price would be higher once v2 is released but that's simple risk/reward economics for you. Lastly some investors are interested in the voting/staking rewards which are currently about 10% per year. Ark has a constant block reward of 2 Ark per block and it will remain the same for the foreseeable future. The 10% is calculated by dividing block rewards forged by the delegate according to the offered percentage among the voters by weight however as the supply of Ark grows this % will decrease since the block reward is fixed.",1522852417

More than likely it is Tatsuaki Okamoto or someone who knows him. It isn’t some guy who read the Bible and googled ‘how to crypto.’ It would be someone who had a long history of working in the industry in academia, government, and private industry. I mean all three. IE a university, writing research, and working for the NSA. Like Tatsuaki Okamoto. This sort of knowledge doesn’t just spring up over night. 

“Recently, several “divisible” untraceable off-line electronic cash schemes have been presented [8, 11, 19, 20]. This paper presents the first practical “divisible” untraceable1 off-line cash scheme” 

“we prove the security of the proposed cash scheme under some cryptographic assumptions. Our scheme is the first “practical divisible” untraceable off-line cash scheme whose cryptographic security assumptions are theoretically clarified.” 

“Note that coins divided from the same coin can be linked each other in the proposed scheme, although they are anonymous, i.e., “untraceable” from the customer’s identity. In other words, the unlinkability among divided coins is not satisfied, although the untraceability is satisfied.” 

1995. Annual International Advances in Cryptology Conference. Tatsuaki Okamoto submitted his paper in conjunction with NTT laboratories. PhD in Applied Math entirely achieved through University of Tokyo. Was working on this and wrote about it since the mid 80s. Also worked with the NSA.

"It's an alternative to bankruptcy. Bankruptcy would lead to the liquidation of MtGox's assets. The creditors would receive $483 per bitcoin and 100% of the cash they had at MtGox. The surplus (~160,000 BTC and BCH, plus ~200,000 BTG) would be converted into JPY and given to MtGox's shareholders (Mark Karpelès and Jed McCaleb) and the Japanese government would get a large portion of that money in taxes.

If the court accepts to switch from bankruptcy to civil rehabilitation, the remaining bitcoins and the forks could potentially be distributed to the creditors instead of being sold for JPY and given to the shareholders.

We could hope to receive around 1/5th of a bitcoin for each bitcoin we owned, which is substantially better than $483. Plus, converting the bitcoins and the forks into JPY would be catastrophic for the BTC, BCH and BTG markets. This would probably also affect other cryptocurrencies that have nothing to do with bitcoin.

Mark stated that he doesn't want the money and that he supports civil rehabilitation, which is fantastic. Most creditors do too in all likelihood. The court will only entertain civil rehabilitation if the plan makes sense and is in everyone's interest.",1522851457

"That is clearly not what he said. In that circumstance, ""distributing it would still end in more costs"" not necessarily affects his willingness to distribute (in that case, at least).

Notice though that his willingness to distribute may be quite irrelevant, though, because he is personally bankrupt. Depending on how much money ended up in his hands in the end, he might not be able to give back anything even if he wanted.

So, if through civil rehabilitation we can get, let us say, 80% back of the 160k BTC, through suing him (e.g., for criminal responsibility in the hacked coins) we might get 30% or less.

Additionally, Karpeles is not the only shareholder. 12% is owned by Jed Mccaleb and his claim was bought by Brock Pierce. He paid for buying that claim, so he will not easily give up his share (and let us hope that helps to back the tethers!).

Oh, and do not forget that Roger Ver owns part of Coinlab and its bogus $50M claim on Gox.",1522851391
"I mean, you can dream. But if the economy tanks crypto tanks faster, there’s not a doubt in my mind. Casinos are always hit hard by recessions because the vast majority of people don’t gamble with money they can’t lose. Same with crypto, you had people here literally saying as much with the “only invest money you’re completely ok with losing” stuff. And with casinos, you don’t have the added pressure of knowing if everyone else stops going your chances of winning decrease drastically like you do with crypto. ",1522851374
"Feels a bit tense in here...no, lol.

I’m a long term holder too so I don’t really care the next 48hrs.
But I am watching to see if we stay above that Feb 6th low....why would a long term holder care, because even if those of us who bought over a year are still way up I absolutely do want to see that Feb 6th support level hold, and as we all know, it’s likely that “if” we break below our Feb 6th low, the odds are it will be within the next few weeks. Every week we stay above that support level the law of permanence creeps into investors minds.

For many of us, we still have a hard time buying because we remember buying at cheaper prices. Every week this price becomes more part of what is consider the normal price and the memory of buying $2000 Bitcoin becomes  farther and farther into our memories and replaced with the new norm.

Respecting the support level of Feb 6th is a pretty big deal for me. Because if it doesn’t hold then we need to rebuild the permanence of value at the new price.

Instead of mathematical proof of his grandiose claims, he gave us NDAs, backstage bamboozlement, and promises of the great things he's going to do in the future.

Now CSW is trying hard to position himself as a Thought Leader on Bitcoin Cash. Imagine if this guy's mug becomes the most recognizable face in Bitcoin Cash. Not only does he not understand Bitcoin at a technical level, but he's repeatedly demonstrated his intention to mislead people.

"Question, is this true? Or even partly true?

Wallets like exodus and Mycelium are all running “on top” the Bitcoin Core wallet. Does that question make sense? 
I’m considering making a tutorial on the core wallet and a teacher of mine said this, but I’m not certain. (Maybe the tutorial will stay really simple)

Are all the Light wallets running bitcoin core wallets behind the scenes, with the core wallet doing the work and exodus just being a nice user interface on top of it?

If you think this is true, then that is really bad for Bitcoin. That means that awareness is saturated, which means there is little potential for it to go up any more, compared to before when awareness was still growing.

No one really wants to use it. It’s highly inconvenient compared to traditional means of shopping.

Imagine for some reason shorting bitcoin last october, with maturity date in december. That shit would hurt a lot more than just buying it in december and selling it now, because you already gave the money you were willing to lose when you bought it. If the price starts to rise after you short it, you don't know how much you will lose until you close the position, in theory it could be unlimited if you wait until maturity to close the position. 

Just imagine shorting now with maturity date a month from now, you don't close the position until then, but bitcoin increases to $100.000 (hypothetically). You would be super fucked.

"&gt; You know, if he was seeking attention for himself, we'd be hearing about him much more often than we do. I think the point of this post is actually the opposite. He wants less attention (and is willing to take temporarily elevated attention to achieve that).

He has spouted the same rhetoric for years but still has failed to answer even the most basic questions about what actually happened. You could check this for yourself but he deleted all of his posts some time ago. 

Note that he won't answer any of the creditors poignant questions relating to the bankruptcy but he will answer questions about his underwear.

At this point in time it's safe to say that yes he does just love the attention and this AMA serves nothing other than his own colossal ego and delusions of grandeur. 

&gt;So, while you might have a point in criticizing his spending, it's pretty likely things would have failed even more spectacularly if he had tried to use all his time for the stressful work. You're basically saying that he should not have had any free time at all.

If you believe the story he has told, Mark didn't even have a basic system in place to reconcile account balances with btc wallets. 

But of course this can't be confirmed because the ""records"" he has provided the court have been somehow destroyed or manipulated. 

I'm not saying that he shouldn't have had any free time at all. 

What I'm just saying that maybe he should have spent **a few moments ** using his wonderful coding skills or spent **a couple of measly dollars** of the at least **$200m** of our money that he spent on god knows what to come up with a basic accounting system so that the thefts couldn't have gone on for so long or for such a large amount of money. 

But of course he couldn't find the time to do this very basic, obvious thing, he could however find time to go gallivanting around with hookers and buying expensive machines for his failed cafe.

&gt;Also, it's quite clear in hindsight whose money he was using. However, it's rather likely he didn't realize it at the time and thought it was his money to use.

It's rather more likely that he knew exactly whose money he was using for a long time considering the emails indicating he was well aware he was in the red since the very beginning. ",1522849476

Bitcoin has been through [quite a few bubbles](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6a301q/evolution_of_bitcoin_bubbles/). The first few peaked 3-4 months apart (and found their respective floors even quicker than that). The next bear market took longer to find its floor, and the following bubble didn't peak until almost 2 years after the preceding one, but the price found its floor less than 5 months after the bubble peaked in mid-2011.

I sorta get the point but honestly using web wallets or phone wallets is just as easy as using a bank website. I dont think having an optional centralized system to hold your crypto would really actually be easier. However it might be safer. I think the main appeal of that sort of system is that it your crypto could be insured. Also if you lose your login information you could just go to your bank prove your identity and regain access. Thid makes it safer for people who dont trust themselves to handle their money safely.,1522848535

I want to thank you.
  
Probably not something you hear a lot these days.  But back in the days before Gox went belly up, I was a plebe who had decided to look into bitcoins.  I had heard about them for a while but never had any money to invest.  
  
I had gotten a career level job then and decided to jump in.  Naturally I wanted the most trusted and stable place to put my first investment.  I chose Mt. Gox because, well because it was the obvious choice.
  
So I sent out all the information requested and waited.  Two weeks went by and I heard nothing.  I got some hardware fob in the mail that would give me access to my account, but no account had yet been set up.
  
I contact Tech Support who told me that things had been really backed up there and they'd get back to making my account in a week or so.  That sounded really odd to me.  But I waited anyway.
  
At the end of that week, I had still heard nothing.  So I reached out again.  I got an apology and pretty much the same answer.  At this point I decided maybe Gox was not the best place for my money and went elsewhere.  Honestly I don't even know where it was but the coins I bought eventually ended up safe on the Trezor that sits on my desk today.
  
A few days after I made my first purchase at the Gox alternative, I saw the news about the coins lock down.  Then it went belly up.  Then people we camping out in Japan with big signs.  But my coins were safe in my other account.
  
Had it not been for the immense incompetence of your staff at creating new accounts, I would have given Gox my very first coin purchase.  And would have almost immediately lost it all for good.  And then I most certainly would have been so soured at the experience that I would never have had anything to do with crypto again.
  
So again I want to thank you and your staff for fucking up my new account create request and bullshitting me about it to the point where I no longer trusted Mt. Gox.  I also learned almost firsthand why you never ever keep your coins on an exchange and always be in direct control of your keys.
  
Thanks.  A lot.  Seriously.",1522847926

New investors become interested at all points along the way - It seems to have found a way thus far.

Personally I think it could manage a *partial* recovery on the path back to 19k just from people who were already in the market before and are waiting on the sidelines with their cash (whether it's fiat or tether on an exchange).

In the realm of little to no regulation of crypto, can you truly, accurately detect this happening?  I don't think there is an effective framework to prevent or detect, the entity mixing the coins would have to slip up, but if there were no slip ups, you could inject unlimited valuation into cryptocurrency on the back of tether that's pegged to a price but not backed up with legitimate fiat despite that being the expectation.",1522847784

"Had a dream in June 2017. 

Was in a field.  3 Coyotes surrounded me and followed me with no ill intentions I could see.  They seemed like they wanted to be friends. They ran away shortly after I moved toward a house.  A bear shows up.  Bear charges me in the garage of the house.  A man comes out of the house and grabs the bear by the neck as it charges and chokes the bear out.  The man acts like it was nothing and disappears.  

I think my dream was telling me to be wary of the market. I had just started investing at this time.  Maybe I was warning myself of this bear market to come.  If my dream stays true something will end this bear cycle suddenly.  I don’t think that has happened yet but it seems as if the market may be priming itself for the event. We are edging back to a bullish sentiment but not there yet. One significant piece of news, adoption, partnership, regulation, or something may be the catalyst for a turning point.

Polychain were the first crypto fund I think. They bought at good prices. They got Monero at around $30 a pop. They got in early.

VCs also get better prices on ICO token sales, from what I've seen. So the best connected aren't even playing the same game.

"&gt; IF YOU want to mine bitcoin from the comfort of your own living room, you require three ingredients; some free software, a steady supply of (preferably cheap) electricity and a computer.  The citizens of many nations have become devotees. But why are Venezuelans among the most avid miners of the cryptocurrency ?
&gt; 
&gt; Bitcoin provides people worldwide with the ability to exchange tokens of value online without having to rely on banks. All the necessary record-keeping is decentralised to a “blockchain”, an online ledger that holds the transaction history of all bitcoins in circulation. Crypto-evangelists extol the virtue of its decentralisation, highlighting that there is a fixed total supply, preventing the token from being debased by tyrannical governments. In functioning democracies with reasonable rates of inflation, there is limited take-up because there are so many other options on offer for creating wealth or for investing. Venezuelans, on the other hand, have almost no such opportunities, since the bolivar, their currency, has lost 99.9% of its value since 2016. Strict currency controls have been in place for 15 years, cutting off the supply of hard currencies, like the dollar, that retain their purchasing power. Even Jamie Dimon, a well-known banker who called Bitcoin a ""fraud"" that will ultimately ""blow up"", has admitted that, in somewhere like Venezuela, it might be useful.  
&gt; 
&gt; Venezuelans who can afford it have imported machinery such as the Antminer S9, a shoebox-sized contraption retailing for roughly $2000 on Amazon, that sucks in cool air and electricity and spits out noise, heat and freshly mined bitcoins.  And in one area Venezuelans have an edge.  Electricity price controls have subsidised supply. The extent of the government's subsidies means that, according to data from Crescent Electric Supply Company, Venezuela is the cheapest place to mine bitcoin in the world. Miners are arbitraging, buying an underpriced commodity (electricity) and converting it to bitcoin for a profit. On localbitcoins.com, a site that allows the crytocurrency to be exchanged for local currencies worldwide, Venezuela trades more bitcoin than China.  Venezuelan miners can earn hundreds of dollars a week, a relative fortune.  Some use it to store savings, others to buy scarce necessities.   
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately, the government has caught on. President Nicolas Maduro does not like bitcoin miners, and the government's ownership of the electrical grid enables it to locate, and crack down on, those using the unusually high amounts of electricity that bitcoin mining requires. There are no laws regarding cryptocurrencies, so targets have been arrested on spurious charges such as energy theft. Mining equipment has been seized by officials, some of which were then used for their own gain. While bitcoin can protect from the tyranny of governments printing money, other kinds of tyranny remain unchecked.",1522846675

Thanks for doing this AMA.
While I understand why people who lost money in the colapse are angry, I do want to thank you for helping grow the ecosystem in the early days.

2) during the silk road trial, Ross's lawyer tried to name you as the DPR. Did that affected you in anyway? Was there any legal repercussions for you? Have you ever had a chance to speak with Ross?

"I have done that blockchain analysis, hence my claim that he's a fraud and not a thief (at least not in the sense of stealing those coins). In addition to claiming to own coins stolen out of MtGox as well as coins clearly controlled by MtGox, several of the other claimed addresses can also be confidently tied to other people rather than to Wright. As far as anyone can tell, Wright himself never historically owned any significant amount of bitcoin, and just runs around pretending to own other people's bitcoin instead. That he included stolen MtGox coins in his list simply reinforces that he had no idea what any of those addresses were, or he would have presumably avoided ""implicating"" himself.

When the news of the lawsuit hit, Wright quickly denied that these coins were the fabled ""Tulip Trust"", so I guess now you're supposed to believe that there's *another* million BTC in a trust somewhere out there that he totally for sure owns (pinky-swear), unrelated to the million BTC in a trust that he was just caught lying about?

"Yes, very good. But bear in mind that the Bitcoin ecosystem outside of Exchanges isn't typically commercial.

Between a vendor and the exchange the infrastructure and software is largely non-commercial and it is typically very difficult to commercialise.

For example, if I build the worlds most fabulous Lightning Wallet, I'd struggle to be able to turn revenue from it since in order to do so, I have to make it closed source and license it.

Being closed source adds an aspect of trust that would otherwise not be there which turns a lot of savvy users off using your product...no matter how straight up you actually are.

Without revenue development of tools, services etc takes a lot longer as you have to rely on the generosity of others.

There is a lot of generosity in the Bitcoin space, but there are far more people simply demanding more progress. This demand requires technical resource both manpower and infrastructure...these are expensive.

Ive built and scrapped numerous projects because I've been unable to sustain them financially and when your motives aren't profit driven it's virtually impossible to attract investors because they want a return on their investment...which is yet another cost.

If it was possible to rely on donations alone, we'd probably see faster progress since people will feasibly be able to dedicate more time to their projects rather than their main source of income.

A lot of us out there are desperate to build and sustain things but we are unequipped financially to do so.

That said, if someone out there wants something developed or some degree of consultancy, I am for hire...DM me.

Or if you're simply feeling generous and just want to dump some money on someone that might just do some good in this space with it. Get in touch.

1. I'm sorry but I cannot respond to that at this point due to ongoing legal proceedings.
2. At the time withdrawals in BTC were closed only transaction malleability was known, and stopping withdrawals was a way to stop this from being abused as we couldn't track transfers which IDs were changed. While over 1000 BTC were stolen that way, it wasn't expected any large amount of BTC were missing until later investigation in MtGox assets, which then prompted filing for civil rehabilitation.
3. Chances are the hacker couldn't transfer more, which resulted in avoiding detection.
4. The only other shareholder would be Jed McCaleb, but I do not think he wants (nor needs to) claim anything.

Hopefully this case can end soon with all assets distributed to creditors.",1522845811

If he recevie this surplus as a dividend, tax advance is 40% but later settled on his final personal income tax (20.4%) what would get him big tax return. Beside, when trustee settle with all creditors, what he almost can do with recent btc/bcc sale and no need to further btc+ forks sale, or at least not all remaining btc, Mtgox and Tibanne are not longer in bancrupcy liquidation and can resume business with this capital without requesting paying to the shareholders as a dividend. What I try to say: Trustee or nobody can force any shareholder (Mark) to receive dividend or to liquidate remaning capital (by court order) if there is suficient monies to settle all creditors, but even if this remaining btc are liqidated (sold) it will be at mtgox capital (mtgox held bank account).

"Psychopathic behavior are not a proof that anarchy (or non/low-hierarchical) society is impossible, if anything we should avoid creating a society that would incentivize psychopathic behavior.

Take drugs for example, naive law (drug is bad, drug must be forbidden) lead to situation with incredibly strong incentives to act dishonestly because drug trafficking becomes an incredibly profitable business (historically even led to drug traffickers being nearly as powerful as countries itself).

The anarchist approach would be drug is bad, let’s trust people judgment but let them buy and consume drugs.

The solutions is to don’t create bad incentives with naive law (even though they come from good intent they can be counterproductive)

And thats in essence the whole difference between anarchist and socialist.

Socialist think « little » peoples are stupid and must be protected from themselves therefore restricting freedom is okay or necessary.

Anarchist think peoples are smart and if they are left free, following they best interest they will act for the common good. (Free market demonstrate that)

Just like bitcoin if rules are carefully crafted to not create bad incentives then there is no need for a superior authority to punish bad behavior because the market will punish bad behavior itself.

Just like bitcoin, though obviously not perfect, you cannot deny it works. 

It is not called p2p honor cash system as you said exactly because is rely on greed instead of honesty. 

A system that would rely on honesty alone is a system designed with poor incentives and will need an authority to take the punishment role the incentives (market?) fail to gives. (And it authorities can be corrupt themselves because they too facing the same bad incentives.. etc..)

Anarchist is not no rules, it is no rulers.

Just like with Bitcoin.

I would add that socialism has no proven to be sustainable either.. even moderate form of socialism lead countries to have chronic deficit, meaning one generation pay its privileges/benefits by leaving immense debt to the next generation.

Which I think is fundamentally immoral.

(Not even talking about strong form of socialism which have led again and again to incredible amount of suffering around the world and death number that dwarf world wars..)

If he recevie this surplus as a dividend, tax advance is 40% but later settled on his final yerly personal income tax (20.4%) what would get him big tax return. Beside, when trustee settle with all creditors what he almost can do with recent btc/bcc sale and no need to further btc+ forks sale, or at least not all remaining btc, Mtgox and Tibanne are not longer in bancrupcy liquidation and can resume business with this capital without paying to the shareholders as a dividend.

I will not attack Craig, but I will say that so far he's done nothing substantive for BTC or BCH at all. It's also a tremendous coincidence that all the things some peoplr would consider him having donde for it (""giving talks and inspiring people..."") he happens to have profited greatly from. 

I see a pattern, and since you speak of ""proofs"", what I can say about him is that he has not proven to be an honest or positive asset for BCH at all, in any capacity.

Funny you didn't so much as ask or were interested in the details of Craig's attack on Tom. You just assumed /u/thomaszander deserved it somehow.

If this won’t happen you’re a real fraustar and most likely end up being shot. I think you’re smart enough knowing if you get rich out of this dilemma you’re a dead men and somebody will eventually do it.

He doesn't need to put himself in the spotlight and he certainly could send his energy elsewhere and would be just fine.

In contrast, look at the motivations of Samson Mow. He started as a Twitter troll before being hired by Blockstream months later. He has continued to troll, only now he is paid for it. As a non-wealthy individual, he depends on Blockstream's salary for survival. He's not a developer or an economist, yet will still say anything affirming Blockstream's 2nd-layer middleman-settlement business despite having no real authority to do so.

"&gt; First of all, Bitcoin (BCH) is trustless, permissionless, and agnostic. It's not about people and personalities. At least it shouldn't be.

Tell that to CSW who makes every attempt to make it a cult of personality.

&gt; I'm pretty sure there's a concerted effort to troll around this particular point, because well... trolls will try to attack BCH from every angle, including the big names associated with it.

And the endless every day for months and months and months plastering and cultivating the CSW cult on this subs reddit is no manipulation of some sort is it?

&gt; I'd like to point out that at the end of the day, all such ad hominem attacks are still ad hominem attacks, and therefore weak.

Pointing out that somebody lied and manipulated to appear to be Satoshi isn't an ad hominem attack. It's facts. Citing facts now ""ad hominem attacks"" are they?

&gt; But they are especially weak for those trying to prove Craig wasn't part of Satoshi as if that even matters.

You got that backwards. It's on CSW to prove he was. There is no proving he wasn't, but there is near certainty he wasn't because he tried to lie and deceive his way into beeing seen as satoshi without the ability to prove it. The burden of proof is squarely on CSW.

&gt; Regardless of whether he's Satoshi

Isn't.

&gt; I think its unfair to accuse him of ""fraud"" because claiming to be Satoshi (and then not proving) isn't fraud.

Using lies and manipulation to try to impersonate somebody he isn't isn't legally fraud. It's just factually fraud. The legal fraud part would be when he commits other crimes in the act of impersonation (such as forgery, wire fraud, etc.), which is usually difficult to avoid with real non anonymous entities (but fair game for an anonymous persona who can't sue).

&gt; Also, giving away tons of money to various BCH endeavors doesn't seem like fraud either.

Citation needed.

&gt; And if he is Satoshi

Isn't. Burden of proof is on him.

&gt; SATOSHI was on record calling for on chain scaling and an electronic cash system

And that's where most everybody has their idea that this is what should be done from, not from CSW.

&gt; The trolls would like to have everyone believe that we only give credence to on chain scaling because we ""believe in our leaders"".

I bet they do, that doesn't mean you can't take a hard stance on CSW.

&gt; We're going to scale Bitcoin (BCH) on chain to be a global peer to peer electronic cash system

I don't believe you're talking about the same ""we"" that CSW included himself into when he said that. Cause he's done jack squat other than hoarding software patents without offering them under an open source compatible and harm limiting fashion. Far as I know he can't even code, and neither he nor his company have ever contributed a single line of code to anything.

&gt; If you think you're going to stop us by discrediting any one individual (whether they deserve it or not), well, you won't.

I have no desire to stop you from scaling. I support on-chain scaling. I don't support CSW in any way shape or form. Supporting on-chain scaling and criticizing CSW are not exclusive. And it's not discrediting, that's what CSW did to himself. It's reminding everybody of the facts.",1522841070

I doubt Craig is a thief and I actually think he is Satoshi, but if the documents in the case are legitimate and Craig claimed to own private keys to Gox addresses then the Gox creditors deserve to know why as that is highly suspicious.  His Tulip Trust is supposed to complete in 2020 so Kim Nilsson should just watch and ensure that he can't trace the coins that Craig moves out of the trust back to stolen Gox coins that he has been moving around through wallets owned by his associates for years to cover his theft.

Just as an example, if you take the daily RSI and apply it to december last year, you would have had to sell at 2017-11-25 when it went over 70 which is a clear indicator of it being overbought.

I have had a few questions on my mind for years some of which you may be able to answer here.

1. Who wrote/managed the ""Willy bot"" &amp; what was it's intended purpose? 
2. Pior to the closing of withdraws at Mt Gox at what point were you aware that the BTC had gone missing? 
3. Chain analysis seems to show that the hacker/hackers were stealing coins for years prior to the final bankruptcy. 
Are you aware of any reason why they simply didn't empty the wallets completely? 
4. Are there other company shareholders who also have claim to this extra BTC? Do they share your opinon that it is the creditors who deserve it?

Despite what people may think Mt Gox helped build and shape this community. It showed people bitcoin had real value when it was just some cool tech. We learnt from Gox and the community is stronger because of it.

Thank you

Do you think decentralized exchanges and atomic swaps will eliminate counterparty risk and disintermediate crypto markets?,1522838823
it might not change you're perspective of ' world' but from the first time someone thought about bitcoin. it changed the world. if you think about it,1522838782
"Actually most exchange are making quite a lot of profit. CoinBase made the equivalent of some 150k BTC revenue last year, probably more because the price was lower at the beginning of the year.

There also remains the possibility bitcoins are found following the analysis of Alexander Vinnik's computers and other electronic devices. I wouldn't put too much hope there, but one never knows.",1522838779

"Thanks for doing this AMA. On 2011/04/28 Jed McCaleb wrote to you

&gt; There are 3 solutions I have thought of:
&gt; 
&gt; - Slowly buy more BTC with the USD that Gox Bot has. Hopefully you would fill up the loss before the price got out of hand.
&gt; 
&gt; - Buy a big chunk of BTC (really just moving the BTC debt to the USD side) If BTC goes up this is a huge win. Problem is there isn’t enough BTC for sale on mtgox. Maybe you could find someone on the forum to do it.
&gt; 
&gt; - Get those crystal island people to invest･They have 200+ BTC so they could fill in the gap.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe you could just mine it？

So that's actually 4 possible solutions. Which if any did you and/or Jed try to apply?

Did you reply to this email, and if so in what way? ",1522838666

"""Oh, hi mark!""

1) Let's say you end up with the 160k BTC. Would the trustee decide wether to just hand the coins over to you or sell them for JPY? Would it be up to you? Could the trustee even be forced by law to sell?

2) Let's say the coins are given to you directly: would you make an effort to distribute those to the creditors? Is there even a legal way to do this properly?

3) If MtGox were still around today, what would've been its policy on forks like bcash? What's your personal opinion on this schism?",1522838618

I don't care about Bitpay. I care about what the data in this article says about user adoption of Bitcoin as a payment method.,1522838089
"I'm of mixed opinion on the future of crypto. I think crypto will stick around, but I'm not sure it'll ever ""mainstream"" in the way that a lot of people hope. So I'll go over my concerns. 

1. Too complicated for the average person. Cold or hardware wallets, private keys that can be lost and as a result you permanently lose access to all your money, wallet hacks, the presence of thousands of different cryptos with thousands more on the way, etc. Massively more complicated than fiat and credit cards. That's not even considering the extreme volatility.
2. Most of the activity in the crypto market caters to the already existing crypto market. A lot of projects are geared towards making it easier to trade crypto to crypto, or building social media for crypto addicts, or enabling other cryptos to be created, etc. None of that expands crypto's base.
3. Much of the effort towards adoption at merchants has gone unrequited. People keep saying ""it's getting adopted by more merchants"" but I don't see that as being true at all. It's still a small fringe, and many of the merchants who allow crypto payments only do so under the condition that those payments are instantly converted to fiat by some third party. That's not really crypto acceptance. Sure, a customer might spend their crypto, but the merchant only accepts it as fiat. The merchants who will accept crypto as crypto are very rare.
4. I don't think crypto will ever replace fiat in the wider economy. Crypto has too many macro fundamental problems to displace fiat. Fiat has macro problems of its own, but I'm not convinced they are worse then macro problems of crypto. Again, it comes down to volatility. Businesses need to have a predictable flow of income and costs in order to operate. They can't have their cash going +- 15% in a day.
5. Many of the ""problems"" crypto is taking aim at--banks, fiat currency, governments--just aren't seen as problems by the vast majority of people in the world. There are very few hardcore libertarians or anarchists. In that way, I think a lot of cryptos are ""solutions"" in search of a non-existent problems.
6. The sheer number of scams people encounter in the space, plus the very large scale wreckage that many enthusiastic new buyers have experienced in the current crash. My non-crypto friends were once very interested, but now think crypto is all one gigantic scam. The few who I convinced to buy crypto now aren't speaking to me anymore because they blame me for the money they lost.  I think the crypto-core is really underestimating the damage done in the last few months to crypto's public image.

Crypto is designed in such a way that it is incredibly user unfriendly to the average person. The current situation reminds me of Linux promoters in the late 1990s who were convinced that Linux would drive Microsoft Windows out of the market and every computer would be running Linux. Obviously that didn't happen and today only a tiny fraction of computers run Linux. Why? It was (and in many ways still is) very user unfriendly.",1522838066

My question is this:  How realistic is it that creditors would be paid back fully?  I know the crypto world has expanded to many alt-coins now so you coould make profit from more than just Bitcoin itself, but to we are talking about over half a million BTC you would need to reimburse creditors.

I've been following the bankruptcy process fairly closely. It seems the CoinLab case will be the biggest barrier in receiving any payments in the near-term. Is there not an argument for the trustee to sell enough bitcoin to pay the case in full - similar to what he did when he locked in full payment a month ago - to settle the suit? 

While bitcoin creditors would lose out on a reasonably large chunk of what they would receive in civil rehabilitation, it would enable fiat creditors to be paid in full, soon. Also it would speed up the distribution (probably by several years) for those holding in bitcoin.  ",1522837807

"Copy from another thread:

So many issues with Verge, that if the partnership is real we should really start thinking about the market as a whole. My known issues with Verge:

- the ""optional privacy"" feature is not private at all. Stealth addresses are known to grant only forward privacy and are subject to blockchain analysis

- hiding IP addresses is a nice to have feature, but you can do this with VPN or TOR or I2P on your own with every coin

- the dev is a liar, simple as that. Claims from the whitepaper are plain wrong (there is no private ledger, no transaction vanishes, that's not how stealth addresses work). He promised privacy audits, has said he got two back but they did not satisfy his needs. What?! Who did he ask for these audits and is it possible they also said what I claim since the release of Warith Protocol? Why doesn't he let his ""vergefam"" decide and publishes them? I bet there are no audits.

- he breaks copyrights and lies again: he copied the ""opaque address"" feature and claims to have invented it. Usual answer: ""lol, copied from 2015 shitcoin, who cares?!"" (the author of the code could shut down the github repo immediately if he wants too...)

- he risks users privacy. If somebody relies on the tech, and we know it is not private at all at 2018 standard, the user can come into serious problems.

- the 3 million $ funding for an announcement on 26th of march. Funding went through, and there is again no announcement. Postponed, people hyping up again, but with all the flaws mentioned above: which company doing their research would not see this? An amateurish developed crypto lead by a notorious liar not living up to its promises while keeping almost no deadline?

Verge is a perfect example for the cryptomarket: pure gambling. And if the partner relies on privacy this will be a real mess in no time since every transaction to this partner, e.g. pornhub, could be tagged through the blockchain.

"1. When you spend 1 BTC to create a USC 0430 contract, you’ll get 1 USCA contract and 1 USCB contract at the same time both of which can be traded in BTC market. Or you can convert back to 1 BTC with 1 USCA contract and 1 USCB contract. When the contract is due and delivered at 24:00 April 30th 2018 (UTC), against the USDT/USD price e.g. 0.95, a USCA holder will get 0.95 BTC from a USC 0430 contract and USCB holder gets the rest.
2. If you believe there’s a default risk, you can choose to buy USCB contracts. When a default happens leading to a drop of USDT/USD price e.g. to USDT/USD=0.4, a USCB contract will get 1-USDT/USD=0.6 BTC.
3. If you don’t believe there’s a default risk, you can choose to hold USCA contracts and sell USCB contracts. If no default happens, meaning USDT/USD=1, each USCA contract will bring you 1 BTC and the amount you get from selling USCB is the extra profit.",1522836868

in Feb 2014 Oliver Janssens sent you emails asking you to send him 10000 BTC of his coins from MtGox and pressured with his lawyer. One of these emails is shown in this post on [bitcointalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=497847.msg6952045#msg6952045).

"They are currently working on V2, which is a major update and complete rewrite of the code. This will make Ark very firm, secure, easier to integrate and work with, and even faster (current transaction speed is around 7 seconds)

on top of V2 there will be ArkVM, which is basicly Ethereum.

From Ark there will be push deployable blockchains. meaning Free clones of Ark. Private businesses both big and small, organizations, and individuals can have their own Ethereum capable blockchain instantly and for free.

This will create an ecosystem of blockchains around Ark. Ark will be the centrepiece of this ecosystem. Ark will handle conversion to dollar and such, and will be the link to trading exchanges. Ark is also able to do smart bridges, where Ark is an intermediate between various currencies (including the ark clones/side chains). For example this will mean that with ark you can use Ethereum blockchain, or Neo, or any other coin. This really will make things easier from a consumer perspective, because only one coin is needed for nearly all blockchain applications in the cryptoverse. you could also use Bitcoin to enter these services, smart bridges work both way. The key is that Ark is the intermediate.

Now the team is working hard, is expanding slowly but surely, and its becoming more professional. Their focus however is not on hype and quick money, but accumulating talented developers and true consumer adoption. There also might be some type of partnership with the state of France, as Ark is involved with France's legal framework for ICO's.

* Everyone knows that Bitcoin is a cash grab for greedy people, supported by unstable and manipulated marked and it is a hassle to use compared to simple good old fiat
* Cryptocurrency is going to be centralized, projects bought out and decentralized useful stuff will remain underground
* Everyone who is rushing to get merchant adoption is trying to get ahead in the game of a highly unpredictable and volatile speculative business
*  Majority of stores use bitcoin to draw attention, especially online, to get more business. Most stores don't want it because they don't even understand it
* I am repeating all my points because I care, but realize that no one else does as everyone here is just greedy and want to get rich. When everyone cashes out - and cause another huge drop in the prices, who is going to want to adopt the crypto?
* An absolute insane number of projects is going up, and as history shows, a huge majority of these projects will go bankrupt
* Students and scientists putting in work is related to development, and has no relation to money - as it in fact is developement of technology - which once again will be bought out by rich companies.

- Hal Finney regreted in an interview that he didn't mine more Bitcoins in the beginning (however, Satoshi mined a lot). His main inetrest and work focus was cryptography (co-inventor of PGP) and less economics.  
- Nick Szabo fits Satoshi in many aspects. But, doesn't like BCH at all. So, I guess he would have sold his BCH for BTC and thereby completely ruined BCH's value and reputation.  
- CSW claimed to be Satoshi, wanted to prove it, tried to fool everyone with a ridiculously poor ""proof"". Plus, other questionable behavior and plain wrong comments.   
- We don't know much about DK. He was a friend/business partner with CSW, and a computer security expert. Besides that, not much about his life and work hint to a special interest in economics, cypherpunk, or anything similar.

okay I think I got most of it. Other arkies correct me if I am wrong, or add what is missing.

"Yep. You're absolutely right. Just looked it up. But even so, crypto is just so much more accessible, and the multipliers are MUCH faster. Yeah, with leverage I can put in $10,000 and get a 50:1. This will put me at $500,000. So if I earn 5% in a year, which is standard, that gives me a gain of $25,000 in a year. Yes this is a lot of money, BUT there's just been so many stories of people making millions with only a few hundred or thousand after  a few years in the crypto world; this of course makes crypto MUCH more exciting. I can tell you at one point during the recent bull run I had seen over a 100x multiplier in 3 months. Obviously that is MUCH lower now after a total of 5 months, but it's still more than what I would have made in the stock market with a 50:1 ratio in a few years.

"Presumably MAST will enable us to do more complex locking scripts, thus any estimations on how much it reduces tx size don't tell the whole story. How much it reduces tx size depends on the transaction, an average could be estimated but that neglects the fact that with MAST we will start doing even more complex scripts, that is, the ""average"" transaction will change.

Afaik MAST goes far beyond simply ""reducing the tx size by 20%"" or whatever % it is. It would be more accurate to say it ""reduces tx size by 20%, WHILE allowing more complex scripts"", as well as all privacy enhancements and enabling for further development (I think stuff like Taproot depends on MAST being implemented)

The one thing that I haven't wrapped my head around, and notabene I'm quite new to bitcoin development, is the size of the locking script itself. MAST allows us to only publish what's necessary of the redeem script, but afaik it has no effect on the locking script itself? So given very complex conditions, won't the locking script remain large, and grow as the conditions get more complex? 
Or is the locking script always hashed when transactions are constructed? As I'm writing this I feel like that's the case, but I'm not certain.",1522834304

BCH has a longer chain than BTC.

Objectively by the founding rules of bitcoin BCH should be viewed as the true chain. Transaction count was never the guiding metric.

"I must say that right now after the most recent dip I feel like we've gotten rid of most of the weaker money. It feels like we're finally hitting the bottom of this bear market.

However, I'm still cautious to be optimistic because there are any number of things that could drive the market down further which are external to the standard weak money that has come in from the last pump. Things like Mt. Gox dumping more Bitcoin come to mind as a scary possibility for the market.

Either way I'm personally confident from all of the information that I've gathered and been following that the fundamentals of the market's underlying technology are stronger than ever and constantly improving. Not to mention there's lots of great news about new exchanges opening with lots of fiat pairs to separate from BTC as a base pair. Plenty of optimism surrounding exchanges moving to countries where they can acquire official regulatory status and start to operate not in a grey market but with proper government sanctioning.

Pretty sure it's more smoke and mirrors. Also, ringCT would make verge much slower so there goes their ""super fast"" advertising point. TL;DR: verge is a shitcoin that you can make money on.

I'm not op, but there's the presupposition that those who are on core are incorrect in their understanding of satoshi plans. This is not put within enough context to be justified as a claim and also cannot be called neutral as it takes a position on the issue. 

The unbiased phrasing would be more like: Two parties arouse. One believed that the ideal scaling method was off chain. The other believing the ideal scaling is on chain. Both believe they are most in line with satoshi's vision and both have the best interests of bitcoin at heart. For a discussion of which is more in line with satoshi's vision click here: (link to a referenced piece that's like ten pages minimum.) This project represents the on chain solution.

On average if i paid £2 a week in to my work place pension in 40 years time that's £4160 which is fucking nothing... Now if that £2 a week was  paid as Ripple and as the prices changed some experienced trader moved it back and forth for profit my £4160 could end up as £10,000 or i risk it all and i end up with nothing but the state pension because the prices tanked.  
  
So as a working class man working minimum wage jobs £4160 in 40 years time is fucking nothing and is kinda pointless so i'd rather risk it in crypto then gain £1 a week on top of my £65 state pension or whatever i'd get in 40 years time.

Well, that ""$100"" in bitcoin I gave them is only worth $50 now, even though they still feel like it's worth $100. Now they pay you back for their $10 lunch with what was originally $20 worth of bitcoin.

"That is precisely the document that made me conclude he is a CS illiterate. Quote:

&gt; Consequently, we have demonstrated that bitcoin script language is Turing complete.

False. It is a homework level demonstration to prove otherwise. Quoting myself:

&gt; Proof: Assume, by contradiction, Bitcoin script to be Turing complete. Take a Turing Machine that never halts and encode it in Bitcoin script (which should be possible because, because we assumed it to be Turing complete). Since the Bitcoin script will always halt, the encoded Turing Machine must halt, too. But that Turing Machine never halts! Contradiction! Thus, we know Bitcoin script can't encode that particular Turing Machine, so it can't possibly be Turing Complete.

If you think that the major conclusion of the paper is plainly and obviously wrong, you can imagine it is not hard to find wrong claims throughout the text that enabled a wrong conclusion.

The major error is to assume a TM must have an infinite tape in order to execute indefinitely. That is wrong, a finite TM with a finite tape can run forever (and that is why it is so obvious Bitcoin script is not TC).

A few other examples:

&gt; only decidable programs are known to run to completion on a Turing complete system

False, because an undecidable program (I am assuming he means by this a TM attempting to solve an undecidable problem, because he made up that concept and failed to define it) might stops on particular instances of the input, even if it may not stop on others.

He repeats the same wrong thing a few paragraphs below, with a more convoluted wording:

&gt; The set of programs that run on a Turing machine and halt that are not decidable is a NULL set.

He also makes a laughable attempt at showing that Turing's original tape was finite, as if Turing himself hasn't demonstrated is is impossible to know if a TM will ever stop, thus he (wrongly) concludes:

&gt; The process have to halt if the system is Turing complete.

Which is amazing, because to be Turing complete means to be equivalent to a TM in what it is able to to, and he said himself that we can't know for sure if a TM will ever stop.

At least I must give him credit for the creative use of the proper jargon, giving credibility to the technobabble, and for citing some some of the most fundamental works on the field, which are the references for theory of computation textbooks, even if he completelly fails to understand contents of those works.",1522827568

Whether you realise it or not you just repeated a bunch of those talking points in your rant.

&gt; trolls will try to attack BCH from every angle, including the big names associated with it.

Cricising CSW is not criticising BCH, but it’s really useful for his puppets to imply that anyone who is against Craig is against “us”.

&gt; If he is Satoshi and doesn't want to be known, creating doubt was a brilliant strategy that seems to be working great.

If he really was Satoshi and wanted to create doubt the best thing he could do was say “I’m not Satoshi”. That’s if anyone was ever actually asking that question before all this started. There are plenty of more credible candidates who have simply said “nope, not me” and besides the occasional redditor pointing at Nick Szabo no-one cares. Craig, by contrast, turned himself into one of the most recognisable and contraversial figures in crypto. Does that sound like a cunning Satoshi plan?

&gt; If he's not Satoshi and you're upset he's getting too much attention, then why do you help him by giving him even more attention when you fuel the drama/controversy?

If he’s not Satoshi, then he’s a fraud. Those are the only two options. And since he’s not Satoshi I’m going to call out any post I see promoting a fraud within an industry that has been *plagued* by scams and massive financial scandals. 

&gt; People tend to give credence to Dr. Wright BECAUSE he is strongly in favor of on-chain scaling, which we believe in.

This is a line I can agree with. People in this community are only willing to blind themselves to Craig’s attempted fraud because Craig constantly spouts big-block soundbites and frequently criticises the Core devs. 

The problem is you’re still using this line to back up your fallacy that Craig’s critics are anti-BCH. 

What the line really means is that Craig new exactly what to say to ingratiate himself with a certain subset of the Bitcoin community. After his Satoshi claims had been repeatedly debunked he had almost no chance of ever being taken seriously in crypto. But he exploited the rift caused by the scaling debate, told people here *exactly* what they wanted to hear (because he was recycling points that had been made 100 times before), and managed to cause just enough cognitive dissonance to get people to start thinking “it doesn’t matter if he’s Satoshi or not, let’s listen to what this gigantic fraud has to say”.",1522826216

"&gt; So why did bitcoin succeed when it was worth pennies?

Because it was the first one which actually worked, and offered something new and revolutionary, which no other payment system had at that time? It was a revolutionary new technology, and in that sense I think LN isn't a revolution but a logical evolution of an existing system.

&gt; So how did we scale it?

May I offer an analogy? Early ink-jet printers had problems with ink cartridges, because these were too expensive and offered very little ink. Epson solved this by making printers with fixed printing heads and large ink tanks where you can add more ink by buying cheaper bottles which have more ink inside than the cartridges. This didn't solve the nozzle clogging problem, though. HP solved this by keeping the cartridge system, and offering users a ""customer program"" where they send you new cartridges via courier, at a discount price, and in frequency according to ink consumption reported by your printer via cloud.

I'm trying not to be skeptical about LN, and struggling to see the light. I know how the Internet scales, and I think the OSI model is the right concept for any communication system. A.Anotonopulos explained this in one video, saying how phone companies eventually ditched the classical telecom lines and multiplexing in favor of the TCP/IP.

&gt; You can keep advocating for horse and buggies, radio, fax machines and the like

There are some technologies which can scale without any second layer, e.g. polyphase electrical distribution systems, conceived in the early 1900s. That's why I've held onto the idea of blockchains as a good scaling methods. The price ratio between BTC/BCH should be telling me enough, still, I wonder why BCH isn't down to $10 yet. And maybe I've answered my own question now.

&gt; Im not sure why you would ignore every expert on the topic, but there has been consensus for years that this is the most intelligent way to scale the system.

"&gt; Running a node is trivial for any miner. Non mining nodes don't actually matter. In fact they can actually hurt the network by adding another unnecessary hop.

They definitely matter, in that they provide security to the blockchain by validating every block and every transaction in every block. Without non-mining nodes, miners could collaborate to change the blockchain history or protocol at will, which is much more powerful than a &gt;50% attack. On the other hand, if vendors were running non-mining nodes and they tried to do this, the chain would just split, the old BTC would retain its use (and its value, minus or plus whatever kind of chaos a split like that might create) as that's what vendors would already be using, and new miners would flock to the the old chain to take advantage of reduced difficulty.

According to whom? That's a pretty bold statement, considering we already have a major centralization problem in bitcoin.

Maybe some immature kids may think it's ""cool"" that he has balls to do that, but it just makes me take a moment to rethink things, especially since Ethereum has already crossed the DAO hardfork line. I think to myself ""wait a sec, so this #2 cryptocurrency that so many people are relying their future on is run by a person who behaves in this immature way?"".",1522825771
"Since its inception people have been screaming that crypto has reached its peak ~ its done ~ it cannot go up anymore.....

Have they been right thus far?",1522825698
That s not what carlos said when he told me about crypto,1522825671
"&gt; they might execute few trades durimg the day BTC/USD back and forth

Executing trades on an exchange platform doesn't generate Bitcoin transactions.",1522825618
"I don't understand why an add for ig.com.au is listing bitcoin price. I had a quick look around their website and it seems to be some sort of online/private college with it's own trading platform but I couldnt see anywhere that listed cryptocurrencys.

I live in Sydney and have not heard of IG and have not seen any of their ads before but that doesn't mean a whole lot.",1522825605
I hear E\-toro sucks. No one ever mentions it in any of the crypto\-reddit subs. I think they have outrageous fees or something,1522825589
Hi I'm neither a shill nor a bot I've been banned in the past from r bitcoin for pushing for a blocksize increase and yet I think this CSW fraud is hurting BCH and that's why I upvoted this thread.,1522825558
"We're do for another bubble which is going to be larger than the previous one and then a greater crash. Rinse and repeat. Crypto is becoming like traditional stock market, a never ending cycle of bubbles and crashes.",1522825447
"Right, for day traders for example they might execute few trades durimg the day BTC/USD back and forth. So that tops up the volume but it's the same individual.

Then you have the other majority who buy their BTC with USD to later take it to their prefered exchange and buy their NEO, POWR or whatever they like.

We have to read the data, not only look at it!

But yes, its the principal medium of exchange anyway!",1522825350
"Exactly , 98% of people will not take the risk of getting paid in crypto because there's a chance you will go hungry for a day/week/month. It's a huge gamble.",1522825343
"Ill tell you what we are buying.A crypto thats gone up 60% in the past week.how many of your wise investments did the same?if anybody should be talking shit,it should be XVG hokders not you.",1522825329
"Yes, just so.

*""one coin (Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash) having 10% of the price will mean around 10% of the current hash power will be dedicated to it.""* Having 10% of the *combined* price is I'm sure what you meant. So BCH's hashpower would be BCH price / (BCH price + BTC price). Thus if BCH price was 50% of BTC's, BCH would (generally) have 33.3% of the total hashpower. And to be really precise, I guess we should say block reward rather than price.",1522825259
How many people here think crypto won't fully recover and has therefore peaked?,1522825255
This dude realizes that people have massive amounts of financial incentive to attack Bitcoin and it has been attacked by well funded attackers since its inception?,1522825221
