Seems like the problem is that since crypto is unregulated, there is really nothing the law can do.

"It's not about playing a role though... it's literally about including people into the system that western civilization has completely left them out of. It's for social good dude. There's 2 billion people that don't have access to a bank account or the amenities we take for granted every single day. It's not about them injecting capital, it's about providing them opportunities they've never had in their lives. This is a totally separate issue from retail investors in Canada, the US, Europe, etc. entering the market at increased rates, and/or driving adoption.

Honestly, I'm sure there's wealthy people in Toronto who would see that and maybe decide to look into crypto more. You'd be surprised how many rich people live there that are a) stupid or b) have just never heard of it. Like you said, we're at fractions of percent of adoption levels. A LOT of Coinsquare's clients are extremely wealthy people that wire transfer minimums of 10-50k. Of course the ad is also aimed at average joe. But if average joe sees that, and invests now, you better believe he'll likely be up in a year. The market's at prime time for injection of capital. I don't really see crypto as being marketed as a get rich quick scheme... it may be for scam ICOs and shitcoins (which again, stupid people may fall for). But legitimate projects and non-profits like Stellar, or OMG, among many others, have the goal of actually helping people and making the world a better place. Finance isn't always everything for everyone. That said, CS's new ad campaign makes pokes fun at stereotypical images of ""crypto people"", so you could see it as being targeted at people who don't know much.

"Plagiarism is when you claimed to have come up with a novel interpretation of something when it was someone else who came up with it.

So here's the question I want to ask you: In the original paper CSW ""plagiarized"" from, was it about about ""Bitcoin Selfish Mining""? If the entire paper CSW allegedly ""plagiarised"" from was an argument about Bitcoin selfish mining, then that's a plagiarism. And we should all be criticizing the original writers how much of a ""fraud"" they are for coming up with such an outrageous claim. But that's not the case, is it?

As far as I see, he used equations from some previous research by other researchers and failed to include citations. Someone correct me if I am terribly wrong about this, but as someone who have been a ""researcher"" in the past myself, this has nothing to do with plagiarism. It's just a stupid mistake.

The problem I'm pointing out is, most people seem to just hear the word ""plagiarism"" and don't even bother to see what actually is going on. That's understandable since most people don't have time to keep track of all these things.

But what's really concerning is the so called experts who are trying to make a scandal out of this. They are all researchers themselves, and they all know this is not a plagiarism and they all know it's just a stupid mistake, but despite knowing this they want to call it ""plagiarism"" because that's much more effective way to witch hunt. And in that sense, from my point of view these guys are much more dangerous than CSW regardless of whether CSW is right or wrong.

CSW didn't create any propaganda or censor anyone, he just wrote a controversial paper. On the other hand these other researchers are busy banding together on social media and trying their best to kill of this one person just so that they can gain more power. I really fail to see any difference between this type of behavior and the blockstream censorship/propaganda.",1523687566

"That depends on how thick the order book is.  
The price virtually ran from $5000 straight to $20k almost without correcting.  
This did not allow buyers to build up at the prices in between, and create support levels, making for a very thin buy side on the order book.  

Look at the current Bitfinex order book: https://i.imgur.com/mh637Wn.jpg

- It takes 646 BTC to drive the price down to the lower $100 bracket (down to 7900)
- Then it will take 838 BTC to drive it down another $100 (down to 7800)
- Then it will take TWICE the BTC (1,619 BTC) just to drive it down just another $100 (down to 7700)

The longer a price point has been established, or the more times the chart has touched a price point, the thicker the support there gets.  
This is why people say ""parabolic price rises"" are ""unsustainable"".  
And that ""it's healthy"" when a chart ""corrects"" and the price goes back down.  

This STRENGTHENS the order book by allowing buyers to accumulate to support a price point.  

$6000 was EXTREMELY strong because it was just barely above the point where the last correction occurred.  
So a LOT of buyers were waiting here, and it was strong enough to absorb the 18000 BTC sold.

This is why it's annoying that the BTC was being sold by a lawyer with barely any trading experience.  
Almost anyone else with a bit of trading experience could've sold off this amount without crashing the market like he did, just by understanding where the buyers are.",1523687137

**A fire needs to be put out early.**

Bitcoin Cash will never be accepted by the crypto community as the #1 mainstream cryptocurrency if CSW (Fake Satoshi) is running around on stage as its public face.  

If Bitcoin Cash becomes known as ""Fake Satoshi's coin"", it would be the biggest marketing &amp; branding mistake in the crypto world.

Regarding internal criticism of CSW:

- Amaury Sechet / deadalnix (Bitcoin ABC lead developer) [refutes CSW's technobabble](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8aavhc/after_reading_this_post_it_seems_clear_that/dwx9lf9/). 

- Peter Rizun (Bitcoin Unlimited chief scientist) says [""I personally think CSW is a huge black eye for the otherwise great BCH community.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89h3ek/peter_rizun_is_holding_twitter_polls_trashing_csw/dwr0mfp/)

Should the primary coders for Bitcoin Cash - like Amaury Sechet &amp; Peter Rizun - just sit down, shut up, type code, as the Fake Satoshi brand drives a ""unified"" BCH bus over a cliff?

Some more items:

- CSW (Fake Satoshi) [caught plagiarising](https://coinjournal.net/craig-wright-accused-of-plagiarism/)

- [Some more problems with CSW](https://github.com/CultOfCraig/cult-of-craig). 

As long as CSW is on stage, it's going to end up being ""the cryptocurrency world against Fake Satoshi's BCH"".  His [Fake Satoshi fraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Steven_Wright#Bitcoin) hits at the core of cryptocurrency.

Any benefits BCH has from adoption &amp; tech - bigger blocks, Bitpay integrations, CoinText.io projects, potential Purse.io support - would all be destroyed. 

**From a marketing &amp; branding perspective, this would be a fatal mistake that would burn down the BCH house.**

For example, [Vitalik Buterin has been consistently on the side of Bitcoin Cash](https://www.yours.org/content/3c637b53d926/#comment-9eaf227d59c3).  

But even he is [publicly calling CSW a fraud](https://www.trustnodes.com/2018/04/03/vitalik-buterin-calls-craig-wright-fraud).

- The Real Satoshi operated anonymously, and was able to create Bitcoin, birth the cryptocurrency universe, and change the world with a whitepaper we all read.

- The fact that CSW thinks he must run around publicly on stage to make a difference is just another piece of evidence that he is not Satoshi, but rather a fraudster.

For the sake of BCH, CSW needs to get off the stage, and go into the lab.

"no payment coin is going to come about anytime soon or ever as a general purpose payment. i made a post on cryptotechnology of why, might add it here, refute away.



&gt; What do you all think of payment coins in general? I've got a list of points why this wont happen, i mentioned them in the thread on this sub, asking if btc deserves its market cap. Figured it might deserve its own post.

&gt; I think a payment coin (btc, nano, btccash, etc) being widely adopted as an alternative to fiat payment wont happen for the following reasons:

&gt; - cryptos are volatile in value relative to your fiat. if you intended to use it as general payment e.g. buying coffee or a laptop online. the fluctuations in value especially crashes really suck, especially if you have large sums of money there. oh i cant buy that laptop now because my crypto has fallen by 30%. Satoshi said that volatitily would stabalise over time with btc, but i disagree with this, just my opinion.

&gt; - you have no charge backs like with a credit card or pay pal if the merchant does something wrong. so why would i use a payment coin that has no chargebacks if there is no cost advantage? the visa fee is something like 2-3% more if its forex. however the merchant eats the fee. even if the merchant offered a discount for using crypto to buy something, point 1 is still a huge issue, and the savings the merchant would offer probably would not be enough incentive e.g. 2-3% in most cases.

&gt; - with cryptos, you need to be your own bank, securing cryptos isn't hard, but not user friendly to people who are not tech literate, however big strides have been made there with easy to use wallets. However there is still the potential for phishing, losing keys etc. VISA card, no problem, call up the bank, cancel the card get a new one. The bank will refund any money spent by someone who stole you card, at least here in Australia.

&gt; - most payment coins are not not fungible e.g. btc except monero, this means that the btc you used can be traced back to some nefarious activity, a drug deal etc. this could land you in hot water, but not likely. however it would give pause for adoption by merchants. e.g. people could be laundering btc through them to say buy macbook pros and sell them on ebay.

&gt; - in the case of btc and public block chains as soon you spend BTC, people know your wallet address, they now know your balance. even if you try to hide your balance with multiple wallets and transfers, block chain analysis will find where the jackpot is. if they are motivated to do so, perhaps they know you might have a lot of btc for example. coin mixers no longer work. this is a huge problem. monero does not have this problem however as do some of the other private payment coins.

&gt; - in the case of btc, it has slow confirmation times and expensive transaction fees, though this could be fixed with LN. other payment coins like nano do not have this problem, thought i would still add this as a point. i guess this is not really a point to stop adoption. but i added it here as people generally only know about btc.

&gt; - we can see in the case of BTC, it was never really adopted for general payment. most use it as an investment, to buy alts, or people who choose to use it as payment over fiat if its avaialbe, id classify these people as being enthusiastic about using crypto, but you can see in the case of BTC, over the years, most people didnt use it for this purpose. btc was used in darknets however. this is why i invested in monero as i saw the flaws in btc (lack of annonymity, and fungibility) and figured darknets would eventually adopt monero in the long term.

- a with payment coins is that they are also deflationary as they have a fixed supply. libetarians love the idea of hard money that can not be printed, but i dont think most have not studied up on modern economics Keynesian principles are the dominant thinking. you also have the austrian school that stipulates that gold or a fixed supply asset tied to money is better, i dont really agree but they do bring up some good points in some respects with smoothing the economic boom / busts, but i wasnt sold. deflation in a payment crypto is bad, it encourages hording as the value will go up as more people are chasing less btc as an example. you want moderate inflation as it would actually encourage people to spend or invest as holding onto the crypto would see a steady loss of 2-3% a year, omitting price volatility i mentioned in point 1. perhaps the volatility however would be less with inflationary coins. this was a problem with the gold standard and why they abondoned it. this is a controversioal topic. as many people beleive that governments are stealing money via inflation through seigniorage i..e they print it first so they get the most value before it gets further inflated. this is really more applicable to countries who print money to fund their government, which isnt applicable to modern economies. it is an issue in some countries with very high inflation that do just this.

&gt; ive mentioned monero. (not trying to shill here, insert other private payment coin here) it has the flaws of point 1 which is huge, so wont be adopted widely for general payment. however its fungible, people cant look up how much you own. transactions are anonymous. so even with the problem with point 1. privacy even at a cost has value and good use cases. hiding money from the govt, transfering it overseas. nefarious activities, e.g. buying drugs online. but those are niche use cases. so i dont ever see monero or another private coin being adopted for general payment either.

&gt; if a payment coin can some how exist in the future where it resolves the points i mentioned e.g. holding its value to fiat, then id be interested. however maintaining the value of a crypto relative to fiat would require financial instruments like hedging which would increase the cost of using the crypto for payment thus potentially making it moot for general payment for any cost advantage. the charge back problem could be solved by say a company providing an equivalent type of crypto credit card without credit (or with credit), but this would incur cost of using the crypto, banks make this money back with interest, which is very high, credit cards its 25% or so in Australia. 

&gt; So given all these points, and the above paragraph where i see the only feasible way a general payment coin can exist (which would render using crypto in the first place pointless). do you agree? or think that its possible for the wide adoption of a crypto for general payment?

&gt; I also realise that there is more to crypto than payment, e.g. smart contracts, this isnt about that, its about general payment

"&gt;Just because certain Monero fans say false things doesn't mean you can just start throwing the word ""you"" around when speaking to someone else.

You refers to both plural and singular in English. 

&gt; I also can't recall reading that claim anywhere on r/Monero

That's all well and good, but the claim has been made to me at least 6 times over the last year and its clearly false.

&gt;I call balls and strikes, especially in a group that I'm a part of because my affiliation with a group represents a threat to my integrity when prominent members of the group act in unethical or immoral fashion.

Well, we're all happy that you're such a great guy and everything, but uh, this really isn't about you. This is about your community. You can change the subject and make it about you, but we both know that I'm just arguing with you online so you making this about you really doesn't make sense. This is about the xmr community as a whole.

&gt;If any correlation exists, it's incredibly weak. Currently value seems to be mostly driven by hype and marketing.

False. There is speculation, but speculation only works on top of viable products, no one speculates on the value of a bag of dirt.

&gt;You're confusing two different issues.

No I'm not.

&gt;Recently, as in AFTER I wrote this post you're responding to, a new issue was brought to light, which is the ""timing"" linkability. So at the time I was making statements based on all available evidence, I was NOT lying. **No one has claimed that this issue is fixed, and the lead devs HAVE been open about this.**

Get the fuck out of here. You're a liar. I've had that claimed to me several **times this week**; they say that the devs have always known about this and its not a 'new issue'. Now you're saying, 'hey man, this was a new issue so technically I wasn't lying'. You guys are just not very good people. Anyway, I had no posting on that 0 mixin part, please try to avoid condescension.

 &gt;. I haven't claimed that Monero is perfect and certainly no prominent members of the community have made this claim. 

There's no point in arguing with you because you're full of shit.

&gt;Please prove this. Please also prove that the masternodes are not compromised by LE or criminal actors.

The math on Dash traceability is well known already. Even owning 80% of the masternodes would only allow you to deanon 16% of transactions in a worst-case, hypothetical scenario. If you own 50% that number declines to .3%. You need to own 50% of the network, at a prohibitive cost and liquidity, in order to deanon .3% of masternode mixes. In monero, you don't need to own anything to deanon coins 45% of the time.

&gt;WAS a flaw, as in prior to the Spring 2017 hard fork.

STILL IS a flaw. According to the article monero is still vulnerable to one of the timing analyses.

&gt;however currently cryptos that offer optional privacy have much smaller anonymous sets compared to their non-anonymous sets.

False, PIVX's accumulator mints 10% of **all piv held in core wallets** into zpiv. Dash's anon-set grows with every mix. I don't know much about ZCoin.

&gt;'ll be the first to admit that Monero is more traceable than most of us would prefer, but that's why it's a ""project"". 

This is what is important and this is what I was getting at. Monero **is** more traceable than you would like; its more traceable than most of you have claimed in discussions with me. Its far more traceable than other options like Dash or PIVX. 45% of the time is a dead duck. That's a coin toss, the only people who are using monero after that article are stupid people, not anyone concerned with actual privacy. Just people who want privacy because it gives you electrolytes.

&gt;but the existence of masternodes is an inherent flaw in its privacy.

What? PIVX doesn't rely on masternodes for its privacy. You may want to research the coins before posting about them.

&gt;Having to trust a third party is a problem for any privacy-focused crypto.

You don't know how masternodes work, they are the complete opposite of requiring trust. 

&gt;Most of the people I talk to on r/Monero don't care too much about other communities unless they attack Monero. 

Aww isn't that so nice. I guess everyone that says you guys have a toxic community are just lying through their teeth. You guys have really been sunshine and flowers all along. Got it.

It may have started as money but it is critical Tech for everything autonomous.

1. Meter readings - your electric, gas water all use meters. With blockchain those reading will be sent in real time to an secure ledger. eliminating false readings. making real time billing possible, and helping to identify outages. Instantly. 

2. Autonomous cars - AI to AI payments can be conducted without human interaction. your self driving car will drop you off. drive to a parking lot and recharge its batteries while you are not using it. the car will be able to pay the meter automatically. 

3. Personal item ownership - all hardware / items and merchandise using the BC in the future will be easily traceable to their rightful owners. Eliminating the value of stolen items. enabling easy of returns / exchanges / repairs.

4. Car / auto maintenance using BC will become permanent unalterable. the full history of that vehicle will be known. every oil change, every tire chance , inspection and crash. 

5. Black box technology - cars, planes etc using real time BC technology will actively upload all sensor data to a BC, when needed this data will give instant information that will assist investigations. 

6. Tickets - subway , concert, rail etc. Tickets stored on the blockchain can not be forged, are readily available for check. cannot be lost. no more metro card - just walk on to the subway and your phone (or other device) will ID your BC address. easing congestion and saving time. 

7. AI Accounting - It is not a good time to become a corporate finance specialist. This will be automated with AI and BC. Google : KPMG Blockchain

"Okay so I won't get to deep into the economic theories behind it but for most currency tokens (platforms included) value in itself is just the value what people are willing to give for it. From it's limited supply perspective this can be value by dividing population by the amount in circulation. These projects are in itself allready working and ready to accumulate value (except those that are unlaunched: EOS, Tron, ADA, icon, etc. Market doesn't make sense for these) For these to work though at mass adoption there needs to come an [ending to the s-curve of adoption](https://www.workpack.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/S-Curve.png) meaning it's value would finally have something stable enough to be treated as a decent currenty. Bitcoin now fluctuates multiple % daily but when (and if, maybe bch or nano or whatever will succeed instead or both is also possible) it is finally held by by masses prices will fluctuate far less, maybe a few % yearly just like fiat currencies do. Same for eth or so, when the speculative phase is over and it's value can be judged on the demand within the network, it will see far less volatility. 

Now for Req this is a different story, in itself it's doesn't rely on having value on it's own but it will be valued on the amount of transactions it processes. Say it does eventually compete/disrupt PayPal it might see value skyrocketing in the billions but this will be a slow process of growth (maybe even decades). Not a problem and Req is considered a long hold. So here is where it will get harder for them; since many currencies allready there are also planning to compete with PayPal it will be difficult to stay ahead of then. For Req, it's importance is not in processing payment, but in the other features built in what they are developing like invoicing, auditing, accountcy, etc. They don't plan to compete, but to go alongside these other cryptocurrencies and intergrate them. For merchants, I'm sure many might be really happy to have such a platform able to accept all these different currencies and have these features in a way for them so easy they don't even have to understand cryptocurrency itself. Also, it will burn tokens with each transaction creating even more scarcity and a rise in value per token. 

All sounds wonderful for the future but here's the other side of the story:
Much of Reddit is in love with Req but outside of it many people don't think it will succeed saying; merchants don't need decentralized applications/features, they have centralised ones superior and only have to accept cryptocurrency itself. Which many vendors are allready doing now. (They do use centralised payment processors though now). Besides it currently processors no transactions, just like many projects it's all just speculation now but its doing extremely well at 130m marketcap. Nothing undervalued as many claim. It does have a fair advantage to others since it is not prone to volatility; it processes according to current worth of the crypto's and it's token is processed automatically as well. No hassle for merchants or users. 

For a quick valuation; if Req manages to process millions worth (volume) per quarter, and comparing it to PayPal (based on EBITDA number) it will be fair to value Req over 1b marketcap. Until then, its value is fine as it is, promising stuff, but their adoption in merchants and users actually spending their crypto relies on it. If you think it will succeed sure get some, but it will be a long long for it to gain so much value. I'd suggest buying in once they get the transactions rolling.",1523679493

"&gt;Do you not find it strange that there's a financial disincentive to ""use crypto the way it was created to be used""?

Not particularly. People are using it in a way that it falls into that category.

&gt;This is what people wanted when they wanted a fixed supply currency store of value, something that would indefinitely increase in value and so would always be more profitable to hoard than to spend.

&gt;There is something fundamentally wrong with the way it was created to be used if the way it was created to be used is less profitable than hoarding it.

You're talking to a sub that knows nothing about, and indeed cares nothing for, the technology involved or its actual use cases. They don't even know of, or care for, *why* bitcoin was implemented in the first place.

You're largely correct though. The core value of blockchain technology is a trust-less, decentralized datastore, the maintenance of its integrity being founded on its reward based system for those ""protecting"" that integrity (miners, theoretically). 

Most coins and tokens do not serve, and will never serve, any real purpose and therefore *cannot* survive. The current boom isn't underwritten by any logic, or perception of value, but due to ease of access (no accredited investors, no verified brokerage accounts, etc) to what has largely to date been a get-rich-quick scheme for some at the cost of many others propped up by a system of faith that ""institutional money"" is suddenly going to flood public crypto coins and tokens and make all these ""HODLers"" rich.

The gamblers here will shit all over anything that goes contrary to that notion, but it's the truth. Most of the ""use cases"" trotted out - e.g. OMG WE CAN TRACK BEAN TO CUP FAIR TRADE COFFEE ON THE BLOCKCHAIN! - are far more easily implemented with existing tech at a far lower cost.

&gt;I know I will be marked as ""CSW shill"" by posting this, and that's exactly what I'm talking about.

It almost makes me doubt whether a truly decentralized governance is possible in the long term, because humans have tendency to pick sides and hurt one another regardless of how many small groups they split into.

As you mention, this is human nature. It's human nature to disagree and it's human nature to fight over our disagreements. It's unfortunate that people do so by attacking other people, but there's no getting around it.

&gt;it seems that people are saying ""CSW is a fraud because he plagiarized"".

&gt;On the other hand, the people criticizing him for the plagiarism seems to think the missing citation is so important that they would rather make the whole thing about the ""lack of citation issue"" instead of the actual problem the paper is trying to address. Ever heard of ""propaganda""? I wonder why this feels so familiar.

Let's not downplay the severity of plagiarism. I don't know if csw plagiarized or not (I haven't been keeping up for the past few days), but if he has then that's a truly big deal. That doesn't mean the issue the paper presents isn't also a big deal. But it's not like there can only be one important issue going on at a time.

&gt;And there is ABSOLUTELY no excuse, as a mature adult, calling others a ""fraud"" when all they did was write a controversial paper which may or may not be true, is not right. And what's also not right is if you keep going on your Twitter trying to create your own clique of high priest pals trying to extinguish this person you hate from the community. That's disgusting.

If CSW did indeed write the paper, then he is not a fraud (even if the paper turns out to be wrong). If he is claiming credit for the paper, despite not having written it, then by definition he is a fraud. Again, not claiming whether or not he actually has plagiarized since I don't know.

&gt;Lastly, those of you who think ""getting rid of CSW"" will magically solve all the problems and everything will be all right, you are making the same mistake all over again. Historically, whenever one power gets killed off by another party, that ""another party"" becomes the dominant power which becomes corrupt over time. If you call me ""the shiller of CSW"" you're missing the whole point, because what I'm saying is if you try to kill of a power through another power, that doesn't solve the problem of centralization of power. It just creates another centralized power that's even more centralized and stronger, which is not what we want.

It's human nature to blame all your problems on whoever is the top power of the day. The only thing to do is to keep pointing it out.

&gt;What we need is a decentralized community with no single dominant player--which it used to be--NOT a centralized community with small number of high priests censoring others and calling names to people who they don't agree with.

It was never a decentralized community with no single dominant player. At least, it isn't any less so now than it was in the past. Reddit, bitcoin.org, bitcoin.com, Twitter, YouTube, yours.org, these are all centralized platforms. Until we have a truly decentralized platform (which will assuredly attract the worst kinds of people before it attracts everyone else) there will always be dominant figures.

None of this is a big problem for bch for a few reasons. First, merchants aren't paying attention to what csw is saying (for the most part). They're convinced by local movements or employees who are passionate. Second, we are still united where it counts - in wanting bitcoin (bch) to be as good as it possibly can be, to enable on-chain scaling to visa levels of transactions and beyond, to enable and help along the building of applications on top of bch, and to increase the utility and value of bch. None of this csw issue changes any of that, none of that will lead to a hard fork of the bitcoin consensus, and none will actually stall bitcoin development.",1523677157

2) there's wasn't enough donations;

3) TokenPay says they're gonna match;

4) still not quite there;

5) TokenPay sends the rest - goal reached;

Per your post 80% of the 85 mil is tokenpay's. So the real loot here is 17 mil XVG - right now about 1.7 mil USD.

That was the amount that was recently **ALLEGEDLY** moved to Binance. The rest are TokenPay's coins and they are in the control of it.

So the **""biggest scam in history of crypto""** only brings $1.7 mil and they're gonna split it 50/50 between XVG and TokenPay -- that's $850,000 each divided by all the people that are on the scam.

**Makes no sense so far.** But let's continue.

Now why would tokenpay risk their reputation and pretty much destroyed the whole company for $850,000???? 

Why not just send all the XVG quietly so it looks like whales or maybe some **BIG NAMES that want to stay anons** decided to donate? Wouldn't it be better?

For example, if a liquid coin is barely traded in a given day, its usd denominated price will accurately follow btcusd. Cryptocurrencies markets have a somewhat reasonable book depth when compared to the volume of aggressive orders (most aggressive orders are in fact bots executing venue arbitrage). As a consequence, the inertia effect is predominant and prices movement will be coupled.

Coins that are traded against btc and usd are a little more complex to analyze. The opportunity for triangular arbitrage results in movements that depend on the ratio of the book depths on both markets. For instance, if the ""inertia"" in the bchusd market is higher than in the bchbtc market, btcusd will decouple from bchusd, i.e, arbitrageurs providing liquidity in the *usd markets will take liquidity in the bchbtc market.",1523674870

"- when you ""open a long position"" is when you buy bitcoin, say at 10k
- you should then make a ""stop loss"" which limits your losses. you'd say... ""sell if it goes below 9.5k"" 
- the atr (average true range) is a number which shows how much the price fluctuates in the last week or so

so if you open a position now at 10k, and the atr is $500 lately, you could make a stop loss at 9.5k

obviously if the price goes down to 9.5k, you've just lost $500, but it's better than watching the price drop to 6k, right?

if the price goes up to 11k, you could move your stop loss up to 10.5k, guaranteeing at least $500 profit. this is called a ""trailing stop"". if the price goes up to 12k, you could move your stop loss up to 11.5k 

this is one way of guaranteeing profits while limiting losses. this is like, rule zero of trading

My only quibble is with this:

&gt;For one group of transactional users to minimize the time they hold ownership of the token, another group of market makers must agree to hold large amounts of tokens in a way available to transact.

I don't think that's quite right. Market makers don't need to hold tokens. No one needs to ""hold"" them at all for any length of time. Given sufficient velocity and sufficient demand, they could potentially maintain a somewhat stable  value. (Relat",1523672470

"They're only going to get better.  Before crypto, scammers had to put a lot of effort in even if they got your credit card number, and it still might be traced back to them.  The effort and the risk were both annoyingly high, so you only got the most low quality scatter-gun scams.  But now, they can get real actual money, which is effectively untraceable, without any additional work.  The scams are going to get *very* good.

This is what people don't realize.  Cryptocurrency requires a new mode of thinking.  IT security no longer means possibly being inconvenienced, it means possibly losing your life savings.  In the normal world, there's insurance and regulation, and a whole network of controls in place to protect you and provide a legal avenue for recourse if something does happen.  In the crypto world, nobody can stop them, and you can't trace them, and there's no insurance or recourse.  The potential gain for thieves is HUGE and the risk is all but non-existent.  This is why you need to be extra careful.  A crypto exchange, even one with regulations, can just up and disappear with the owner taking his hundred million worth of crypto and setting up a very nice life in another country.  Or it can get hacked.  Same difference as far as the user is concerned.

But the point is, you HAVE to change your threat model for how this is going to play out.

CryptoKitties is a blockchain based virtual game developed by Axiom Zen that allows players to purchase, collect, breed and sell various types of virtual cats. It represents one of the earliest attempts to deploy blockchain technology for recreational and leisurely purposes. The game's popularity in December 2017 congested the Ethereum network, causing for it to reach an all-time high in transactions and slow down significantly.

On March 20, 2018, it was announced that CryptoKitties would be spun off into its own company and raised $12 million from several top venture capital firms and angel investors.

Do the right thing Roger! You can do it!  /u/MemoryDealers 

Yes without nChain we will have less money to fund project, but it should be very clear by everybody that nChain is not funding our projects out of the goodness of their hearts. They are buying themselves in to our communty, trying to integrate themselves on every level.

Like other people have said: We got free of blockstream and now blockstream nummero two is on it's way to try to hijack the project again. 

Say NO to CSW and no to nChain. They are a bunch of frauds and there is no reason why the Bitcoin Cash could not be in DIRECT contact with nChain their investors. nChain was bought by a fund called "" High Tech Private Equity Fund SICAV plc"" whatever that means. Somebody should figure out all the people that the money actually comes from and then approach does people individually. Then nChain is done. 

These investors just want to make a profit, and we know that they way towards adoption should be focussed on profit motives, like Pirate Rick has been teaching the community.

So let's break the nChain and remain free now we still can. 

Do the right thing Roger. Your credibility in the entire crypto space will only go up when you break of relations with CSW and nChain. I think that's a win win for EVERYBODY in crypto that is in crypto not just for the money but also for the freedom that comes with it.

"&gt;  thing I have not seen much of here, is discussion about BTC derivatives. The turning point for BTC, as I see it, was when the authorities approved BTC for derivative trading in December 2017 (link below). Unfortunately, and fortunately for some, this gave speculators the ability to sell BTC without holding a single coin (also known as short selling). This happens in stock markets all the time where the price is driven down not by the lack of buyers, but due to the sheer volume of derivative sellers. You can easily find those stocks that are heavily shorted and it ultimately puts pressure on the sell side driving the price down further.
&gt; 
&gt; We are now in April 2018 and BTC is trading at 40% of its all time high. This is not due to lack of buyers IMHO but simply due to the volume of sellers, specifically on the derivative platform. Think about it, what better way to make money other than sell an asset that is trading at an all time high as there is large potential for a massive sell off. This is why we have seen massive sell offs with BTC after periods of large gains such as, $19.5k, $17k and $11k.

Since solving the problem of possible scaling issues depend on solving the problem of getting widespread use in the first place, logically it does not make sense to spend so much time and effort on focus on the Lightning Network. 

Of course the people that don't know their history or have been victim of core propaganda think that Bitcoin already has seen widespread adoption and ran in to a limit. This limit they say is because transferring more then 1 MB of data from all nodes in a network to other nodes in the network every 10 minutes, and the disk space required to store it .... is a problem.

But what if it's not a problem? With 4 MB per block we can do 800 000 tx per day. But is there even enough demand for 800 000 tx  a day?  Well, I guess now we will never know ... unless we try again. This time with Bitcoin Cash because Bitcoin Core can never ever change  their max block size. People will say: oh, yeah then we will go with Bitcoin Cash ... apparently they were right. ",1523670193

"""fee crisis"" happens over time. CPFP solves that, since the merchant can also fund the fee to give it a higher priority as well. 

Claiming RBF means you don't understand RBF. 
First of all, if I submit a 1sat/byte transaction and want to raise it to a 2 sat/byte, I can. I can't lower it, but I can raise it. I also am NOT ABLE to change the recipient though, so claiming RBF has anything to do with it is false. Secondly, RBF transactions have a flag bit turned to false, and parity to follow. If you are a merchant, you can just choose to accept RBF by conformation only, or not accept RBF at all. So again, flexibility. 

If you bought something for less than $0.50 and then the fees spike immediately, then it may not be worth it. But then you're only missing out on the difference between the fees paid. 

So nobody will run off with your goods.

If BCH is better, they should get a lightning network too. It's much different than the proposed LN a year ago and testnet 6 months ago. 

If I want to send money to you through someone else, they just need a non-zero sum in either channel. I can route 10btc through someone else to you, even if the middleman only has 0.1 Bitcoin. It would take 3 seconds as opposed to 30ms, but it's possible.

"One thing I have not seen much of here, is discussion about BTC derivatives.  The turning point for BTC, as I see it, was when the authorities approved BTC for derivative trading in December 2017 (link below).  Unfortunately, and fortunately for some, this gave speculators the ability to sell BTC without holding a single coin (also known as short selling).  This happens in stock markets all the time where the price is driven down not by the lack of buyers, but due to the sheer volume of derivative sellers.  You can easily find those stocks that are heavily shorted and it ultimately puts pressure on the sell side driving the price down further.

We are now in April 2018 and BTC is trading at 40% of its all time high.  This is not due to lack of buyers IMHO but simply due to the volume of sellers, specifically on the derivative platform.  Think about it, what better way to make money other than sell an asset that is trading at an all time high as there is large potential for a massive sell off.  This is why we have seen massive sell offs with BTC after periods of large gains such as, $19.5k, $17k and $11k. 

So the price of BTC is largely driven by the volume of short sellers, not the volume of long term buyers (eg; Hodlers).  Now my thoughts are that sellers are running out of steam and there is largely more upside at current prices than there is downside, this could mark a significant change in sentiment.  Not to disregard that prices have also somewhat plateaued around the 6000-6500 mark.

This is either a turning point where those derivative sellers become buyers, or continue to sell knowing that the lower the price goes the more risk there is of potential upside and that short trade being stopped out.  Sideways trading is always a good signal that sentiment may be shifting and yes we had some sideways trading recently (31 March to 11 April) which was followed by a large swing upwards. Long, boring periods of sideways trading is what BTC needs people, the more this occurs the greater the potential for upside and the greater the potential for a return of the bull market that we all are eagerly awaiting.

"I wanted to buy some bitcoin when it was ~$1000, but I was too lazy and forgot about it. When I remembered it was $6k. Then I bought. ",1523667190
Whats that?? I can't hear you over the roar of my bitcoin lambo,1523667113
Did he ever run a scam crypto that constantly spreads lies for over a year?,1523667106
"&gt;Arbitrage is an issue too but when the btc ath market cap shrunk to... a 1/3 of what it was so did price 🙄

If market cap shrunk by 1/3 (and supply stayed the same), of course price also shrunk by 1/3. That's because to get market cap, you multiply price by supply. But that doesn't mean that to get $X more in market cap, $X amount of dollars is necessary. It might be 1/1000X or 1000X. It depends on discrepancies in supply and demand.

I posted this a while back to give people an idea of how unreal market cap is.

""And let's say that someone has exactly one bitcoin for sale for 9500. I see that and I buy it. So I give some guy 9500, and some guy gives me one bitcoin. The next sell bid is $1 higher, so technically the price is now 9501. So in that transaction, $16,790,000 worth of market cap was created ($1 * 16,790,000 bitcoins). But all that really happened, though, was I gave someone some cash and they gave me one bitcoin. Certainly, 16 million dollars of value was not created in that transaction.""",1523667041

He used to be a ""Core troll."" You're moving up in the world u/contrarian__. You guys are trying so hard to make ""Bitcoin Unlimited Troll"" be a thing. Not going to happen.",1523666851
"That's the whole point, a way of differentiation is the same in their eyes. Don't expect *Bitcoin core* to be responsible either even if it's less of a slur. Here's the problem that I have, as i have a bit of both, I call them Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash. I see no problem with that, it is what it is. So if BCH turns out to be the better scaling solution, and BTC drops dead, why not wait for that transition to finally claim the name? Now it's horribly confusion and not differentiation at all. I'm fine calling BCH Bitcoin at the end of the day, but for now why this toxicity? Btw, seen the reply for the other guy has well, makes some good points.",1523666851
"He did come across very convincingly in that South African CNBC thing the other day, where he was arguing we're still on track for $1M BTC by 2020. Of course, given what he's put on the block he has every incentive to be convincing.",1523666833

Also I don’t want to say the people that think crypto is worthless and going to zero are wrong. It’s certainly a possibility. Those people aren’t really involved in crypto. And those people  weren’t really who I was targeting in my article. I was really targeting people who are longer term bulls but are trying to be a short term bear.

That sentiment is NOT what comes across when you say things like: 

&gt; What mental gymnastics training have you been taking? /u/coblee

"There was only the largest short squeeze in bitcoins history the day after I wrote it.

Point is anyone that is short right now is exposed to a $1000-$2000 point move in a span of 30-60 minutes at any point in time.

Of course bitcoin can still go down some. It will chop. No shit.

Lets say i make a lot of money in a few years then i will use monero to move it around till i can spend it on shops without any goverment knowing. 

I use crypto because its above goverments, banks, taxes etc. I dont need another valuta in the hands of goverments. ",1523666238
"You are spot on my friend! And either they got pushed a little too hard on the last push and they got a bit squeezed or they may have very well just let us have this little jump right before they resume their fun. Either way it is good for crypto and Bitcoin, the amount of buy pressure has been growing, and as soon as these guys are done shorting they will use their pressure for the buy side since they have accumulated a very nice amount of longs as well I'm sure. They have likely been buying those up as they try to drop us lower and lower. We can't predict their moves, but we can try to follow and profit that way! :)",1523666204
Started eating cheap and depositing extra every month into crypto,1523666182
"To your second point it depends on your model.  Time series or panel data is iffy with crypto due to the lack of data. Now 10 years of daily data to predict a day could work in theory, it’s enough data. I doubt there is significance though. 10 years of annual data certainly isn’t enough to predict a year.

However most of my work is cross sectional which isn’t really time sensitive.

To your first point it is incredibly difficult, in fact near impossible to time inflection points. That’s why market timers fail. That was really the point I probably made poorly in my article. It is impossible to truly know when this cyclical bear market will end. I’m not calling a bottom.

What we do know is we are in a cyclical bear.

And another we do know is cyclical markets end in V recoveries.

The V will be magnified because we are in a secular bull.

In my opinion anyone that believes in blockchain and crypto has to believe we are in a secular bull. The only other option is crypto fails and basically goes to zero. We are either going to get real world use cases, adoption and decent regulation or it’ll be banished to the history books. If you believe the first the debate is whether adoption is to the moon level, Mars or Saturn. The debate is the severity of the secular bull.

Therefore the logical conclusion is a violent V will occur. We saw it the other day (literally the day after I wrote this) of a massive squeeze. More will come.

Maybe the bottom is in. Maybe we get below 7 again. Maybe under 6, but I doubt it. 

The point is anyone that is short right now is exposed to a potential $1000-$2000 point move in a span of 30-60 minutes at any point in time. That is incredibly risky. ",1523666162
It's reverse psychology.  Good news = price drop.  Bat shot crazy devs begging for cash = pump.  Perfectly logical in crypto land.,1523666023

4. Question 1; Spent on what? Those are large amounts of funds, no company or coinproject does this kind of budgeting/spending. This is definitely suspicious or/and that guy is very irresponsible with finance.

6. Not weird? You gotta be kidding. He accidentally forked and all the minned funds could allready been sold in the time no fix was put out. A legitimate dev would not have made this happen.
7. Problem isn't missing the deadlines, it's the marketing behind it promising so much they can't deliver. No comment on McAfee.
8. Again he is irresponsible with money. I don't even care about the coinbase issue but the fact that he can't pay his taxes without it means most of his money is in crypto, which is idiotic. Also, for what other things is that day good than?

Looking quite strong overall and we have formed a bull flag , however, short term we can see RSI divergence on the 30m chart, and tightening Bollinger Bands indicating a small drop pending. We will most likely break down from this bull flag and touch the current trend line (yellow) once more, if we bounce off it we will make our way up to 8400, if we fall through that trend line we could fall back to the long term wedge resistance turned support.

Monitor closely any sudden drop from BTC will see alts flash dump.

"BTC recently spilled out of the bottom of the downward-sloping channel following its failure to form a new lower low last week. That type of signal provides an indication that the price is beginning to consolidate, but it could lead to some degree of retracement of its downtrend that began in early March. The high on Monday aligns with the midpoint of the candle on April 4 and should act as an area of resistance for the price. A close above this level may indicate the initiation of a retracement and the potential to reach the 38.2% retracement of the downtrend at 8400. The current daily ATR is at 522.82 and a potential stop could be placed that amount below the entry price or the resistance level around 7170. are you investing in bitcoin? is the current setback of bitcoin frustrating you? worry no more, using one of the most secured strategy patterns and a reliable platform which i use to invest and trade this particular Coin (btc) and believe me the profits are simply off the hooks. interested folks should get in touch with me and you too could stop loosing your money from bitcoin and get started on making your investment worth your every penny.

"Huh? How on earth was I proven wrong? First I wrote this when bitcoin was 6800, and I still won’t be proven wrong if it goes to 6000. Bitcoin is a volatile asset, it moving 5% is mainly noise. It’s absolutely hilarious you think a highly volatile asset moving a couple percent means anything. 

But seriously if your goal is to scalp 1-3% you can long or short bitcoin virtually anytime, anywhere, without looking at a chart and it will almost always hit your target if you are patient enough.  That’s why TA here is such a fraud.

Obviously my post wasn’t geared to those quick volatility traders (they are really trading vol, not TA). 

My post was geared to legit actual bears. If you think we are still in a bear market...aka sub 6k, or more specifically 5k or under target, you’ll get burned.

"Easy: For literally everyone except those of you here in /r/btc, Core is Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin Cash. Yes, core may have forked. Yes, it may not be what Satoshi wrote in the white paper. That doesn't matter. To everyone outside who sees it - Bitcoin made a choice to fork and that fork is Bitcoin. Period. Semantics don't matter. It's how it's perceived, and that perception to most people is the truth. 

Don't get me wrong, I completely agree with the goals and what is trying to be accomplished with with BCH - I'm 100% a supporter. But there is so much effort spent arguing about Core vs Cash that seems so petty and counterproductive. 

In fact, it's an absolute turnoff. In fact, with the maturity shown by the vocal majority of this sub it's not a surprise that Core was able to be taken over. Ad-hominem attacks, schadenfreude, not to mention the sheer insecurity of being called ""bcash"". I honestly don't understand why we can't celebrate the successes of BCH for what they are. I swear every great story on adoption I read here isn't just that. It's ""&lt;story about adoption&gt; &lt;underhanded comment about core&gt;"" like ""Bitcoin Cash now accepted at Merchant X because Core fucked up!""

I want BCH to succeed. I want your version of Bitcoin to succeed. The reasons that BCH exists are great. It's a superior product. It's a better technology. All of that. Everyone likes to point out how it meets the vision of Satoshi. It's the better product. It's technically superior. So on and so forth.... So if all of those are what is so import.... Who the fuck cares if it's called ""BCASH""? Shouldn't we all just want the right tech to win regardless of name?

I dunno. I just don't get it. This is a great tech, but everyone's just bitching about a name. And frankly, BCH is BCash and Core is bitcoin. That's it. That war is lost. Best beat core in the places that it counts - because BCH can accomplish that and that's what's worth fighting for.

"&gt; Meaning investors will have to pour $450 mil into the market daily just to keep the price flat at $250k. 

Price doesn't work like that. Bitcoin is not an account where dollars are stored. Market cap is a very deceptive number. It's an abstract number. It's not holding a real thing, like an account. It could be that no where near $450,000,000 is needed to create $450,000,000 of market cap, or that much, much more is actually needed to do the same. Price is determined by discrepancies between supply and demand, not by the difference between credits and debits on a ledger.

There has to be some resistance to attempts to dilute the Bitcoin brand, or the bitcoin cash brand. I guess the question id pose to you would be: at what level should a fork be considered a community division, and what level should a fork be a branch. 

Bitcoin cash is not the first fork of Bitcoin, nor is it the largest competitive crypto currency. Bitcoin has never changed its nomenclature previously and it has not caused linguistic confusion. 

I understand you are a bitcoin cash supporter, and it's perfectly reasonable to want to consider it as viable and popular as bitcoin. But by any and all metrics it is a minority fork. We've seen those before. The biggest difference is this minority fork is aggressively attempting to retain the bitcoin brand. Which I understand, and if I believed what some Bitcoin cash supporters believe (that blockstream is evil etc), I could justify to myself.

Sure, it has all these ""flashy"" nee things as you say, are just a means to gain attention, but from what i see, using ADA as an example, its a way to use Blockchain for things such as governing for example... ill have to do more research though, my understanding of it is quite basic/minimal thus far.",1523662989
"&gt;That risk exists no matter what your view of taxes are, meaning it's false to say that this ""depends entirely on one's view of taxes.""

You're talking about risk as being impractical. But Bitcoin is easy to use with a high level of anonymity (somewhat effortlessly if someone understands how it works). Plus Bitcoin and taxes are completely separable things and using Bitcoin without consideration of taxes makes it rather convenient/practical.

Someone's view of taxes (downside) and their view of benefit (upside) will determine the risk/reward decision they are willing to take. If a person believes in his/her government and the benefit of taxes, the'll pay the the taxes and there is no risk to consider. If they don't believe in gov't/taxes, then they might be willing to take more risk and not pay them. Still, we're talking about fractions of risk because it's so small. And in the very small chance that someone did get caught for making a few bucks, the fees would be insignificant. So it absolutely does depend on that persons view of taxes. 

Also there is another consideration. People view bitcoin as a currency. When people travel abroad, often they exchange for other currencies (EUR, USD, CAD, AUD, etc) to buy items in that local country. Nobody thinks ""if one currency rises in value relative to the other currency, then jeeze I will probably owe taxes!"" they just see it as a way to buy things. Same with Bitcoin in many people's eyes. It's another currency use to buy things. 

So yes, it totally depends on ones view of taxes and money in general. And it's practical to use it in various ways or else people would not use it.",1523662955

"Yes, it's currently possibly using the Rootstock layer of bitcoin: 

https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/guides/what-is-rootstock/

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RootStock

&gt; Rootstock (RSK) is a smart contract platform that is connected to the Bitcoin blockchain through sidechain technology. Although the smart contracts aren't actually deployed on the Bitcoin blockchain itself, RSK allows users to send Bitcoin directly onto the Rootstock chain through a 2-way peg, which are then converted into smart Bitcoins on the Rootstock blockchain. These RSK coins can be used to deploy or to interact with smart contracts and dApps on the RSK blockchain.

&gt; The RSK account model, virtual machine and application interface are highly compatible with Ethereum [13]. However, RSK has adopted new opcodes that enable some additional functionality, like contract code upgrades[14].",1523662003

I have some NANO myself but it is by no means secure and trusted, Bitcoin has been working exactly as intended for about 9 years.",1523661861

"&gt; You know you can buy things over the internet with bitcoin in other countries right... It is a self-fulfilling prophecy at this point

shipping across the border is pretty inconvenient and depending on the case pretty expensive. Also, Every bigger company will obey the laws of the country they ship / sell good to. Steam would never allow bitcoin for European users if it's against some EU laws and so on.

&gt;Get rid of the link between BTC and fiat and people with BTC will want to spend it creating a larger ecosystem

but no one will want it... currently, almost every mid size+ company that ""accepts bitcoin"" get fiat through payment processors like bitpay. 

&gt;If Countries start adopting a decentralized crypto which is essentially a gold standard countries that don't cant compete against this.

it's actually the other way around. The gold standard was abolished to be more competitive and less vulnerable from foreign economic attacks.

"I'm not sure why you just listed a bunch of problems about the coin you are defending,  but that you for making my point.  

Firstly,  I already said that btc is OG and paved the way for the rest of us.  Kudos. We will will take it from here. 

Second,  btc power consumption is a net negative,  and people are actively pursuing less hungry options.  Saying that btc could power a country is misleading.  What you should have said is "" it would take an entire country to power btc"". Btc doesn't produce power for anyone,  it takes it.  So stop that. 

On to the numbers. Saying it has a 5.7b revenue stream is great.  But then following it up with a 3b operating cost readily takes the wind out of the sails.  Nobody is battling an eye at a product with a 40% profit margin.  

So ill go ahead and sum up the current pros  for you since you failed. 

- btc is currently the best fiat on ramp to other crypto. 
- btc is currently a reasonable store of value. Willing to say great store of value for those of you who can hold a year or more. 
- btc is known by many,  and understood by few.  This is a pro because as more people begin to understand it,  more people will see that there is any alt out there for every one off btc intended uses.  All of which do it better. 

And in case you were wondering,  bch is garbage too. I'm not a bch troll. Bch is literally bitcoin, but slightly faster and cheaper.  With a quarter of the name recognition.  ",1523661696

"All currency is similar to fuel in a certain sense, anyways.

We acquire fuel so we can use it to make something happen without having to do it ourselves. I want a gear to turn but I don't want to sit there cranking it manually, so I put some fuel in a motor, spark the combustions, and voila, it turns.

We acquire currencies because we want to make things happen without having to do them ourselves. I want an apple, but I don't want to plant an apple tree and wait for it to reach maturity and pick an apple off of it, so I give some money to an apple dealer, they hand me an apple, and voila, I have my apple.

In both cases my fuel/currency is used up. It is no longer tangibly mine. If I want to power more motors, or buy more apples, I need to acquire more fuel or currency.

It is in this sense that they are using the term fuel. Bitcoin fuels commerce. The drug trade is a type of commerce just like any other and it requires currency to run. In much the same way a car needs fuel to run.

If you can't see how this analogy works then I really don't know what to say.",1523661674

"Weird because I thought BCH was formed after Jihan was ousted for using covert asic boost and to keep mining without the Segwit malleability fix, and at the same time spam the network to help push the bigger blocks now narrative to further delay Segwit. 

Segwit is now implemented and gaining adoption by major players, and spam suddenly stopped a few months ago for reasons we can only speculate. Bitcoin didn't actually need larger blocks right now as I can send tx in the next block for 1 satoshi/byte.

"All shorting means is that you're selling an asset at the current price and buying it later at a cheaper price, essentially increasing the amount you have of that asset.

Example: you have 1 BTC = $10,000. You sell it at $10,000, buy it back when it reaches $5,000, essentially making your total 2 BTC instead of 1. 

Going long is the opposite which is what people understand because that's what we usually do. We usually buy and sell at a high price. that's longing.

The catch is that shorting and longing is not actually selling and buying the actual asset. They're buying and selling CONTRACTS from BitMex that says they borrowed X amount to trade. But all they're really buying and selling is just contracts. They're betting on the price of BTC of going up or down.

You simply don't understand that when someone claims they made a 365% annual return they are **not** saying they made 1% compounded every day for the year. No one here is close-minded but you. You seem to think that your crypto is compounding every day, but that's only true if it goes up **every day**. It doesn't. It goes up, then it goes down. That's why people don't bother calculating average daily returns. The percentages are typically very small. Instead, they calculate average annual returns.

If you invested in NCASH when it was .03/coin, and it's now .04/coin, you've made a 33% return: .01 (your profit per coin) /.03 (the original buy price of the coin). If you think the chart is showing you something different, then somewhere you're miscalculating what you think the chart is showing your return to be.

"TL;DR: IOTA is still too new.

IOTA is aimed at machine-to-machine economies comprising of both secure data and value transactions for the Internet of Things, an emerging global infrastructure *much* bigger than crypto. This is similar in many ways to the emergence of the internet, except this time we have an open, public layer (IOTA) which functions independently, both online and offline, and remains secure, fee-less, decentralized with data integrity -- something the internet can not offer. IOTA is cementing itself to be an important layer among many others in this infrastructure. But, this IoT infrastructure is just a baby right now.

In time, adoption will come -- but it will do so gradually. People will not even need to now IOTA exists when they will use the network, or even spend tokens. The odds are, FIAT will remain and IOTA will be the behind-the-scenes currency for machine, trading FIAT for IOTA constantly. 

People will only learn about the benefits IOTA will afford. Most likely, they will learn about module features and how it can help them in the real world, regardless of tokens. 

Example: MAM (Masked Authenticated Messaging) for example, would allow a business owner to grant access to content/services to paying customers, allowing freedom for this business owner complete control over his/her business model (one-time payment model ... *all the way to...*  pay-per-millisecond/view model) -- all this **without** a need for any third party. No more need to pay fees to PayPal. No more need to pay for access to platforms that allow you to sell content online, whether apps, music, blog, courses, product, etc. --  with possibility of *micro-transactions*, allowing a completely new business model currently unavailable.

A lot of people were warned when Bitconnect was going on, and people who were emotionally invested in it were calling it FUD, ignoring all the red flags around that. Now I'm NOT saying XVG is a scam or will pull a Bitconnect, but the truth is there are some serious red flags around it you simply can't ignore: 

1. They've asked for donations without specifying what the money will be used for. 

2. Confusing / changing dates as to when the partner will be announced (First it was March 26th, then April 16th) and some deleted videos that were caught.

3. Weird donations campaign in which TokenPay, an already Verge partner, donated almost 90% of the total.

4. Related to #3 - People donated around 15-20m XVG, and the rest was put by TokenPay. Now strangely 18,6m XVG have been transferred to Binance... I'm being suspicious, but this looks around the amount raised which didn't come from TokenPay.

5. They claim funds moved are ""to pay for Ledger integration"" - that's $1,7m USD for Ledger to integrate them?

6. A weird hack just happened a few days ago, with a massive exploit that allowed the hacker to steal a lot of funds and it was solved also in a weird way by a fork.

7. The coin already had some past bad moments like McAffee pumping it, the Wraith protocol hype which ended up not being impressive at all, etc.

8. The founder was caught writing a post about how his Coinbase account is blocked, and that he needs money for his taxes. On top of that, the new announcement date of the partnership is just after tax day in the US...

(I don't actually know whether the theory is that both FIFO and specific identification of actual delivery would be allowed for reporting, or only the latter.)

I think it would be much more sensible for the IRS to allow both FIFO and optional specific identification, but devising a method of performing specific identification on Bitcoins is challenging at best.

If you think this was ever allowed, you are VERY DEEPLY confused about what section 1031 is for, and what ""like kind"" means. (Hint: It means the thing you're trading out of and the thing you're trading into are ""the same"" or similar in the eyes of the law. It's an open question whether this could previously have been true between one cryptocurrency and another, but it was never true of cryptocurrency and real estate, and as of 2018 it is no longer true, by law, of anything but real estate and other real estate.)",1523657725

"&gt; The monero 'bug' still isn't fixed, 45% traceability bub. No other coin has that failing.

You're confusing several different ""bugs"". The cryptonight bug was fixed, that was the bug that would allow anyone to mint unlimited coins. Then there was the presence of 0 mixin transactions, which was not really a bug, but was an undesirable feature that was removed for good reason. Now there is the issue of timing, which again is not so much a bug, as it is an inherent trait of Monero as it currently stands. This is a recent finding and is a problem. That's where 45% traceability is coming from. Although, you can't simply make a statement like ""no other coin has that failing"" without providing proof. Please prove this, I'm being sincere when I say that I would really like to see proof of this. It is of great interest to me.

&gt; Compared to? If you don't ask this question, then maybe it is YOU who should spend more time in math class.

Compared to pretty much every distribution in the world. I'd say we should at least expect Dash to follow a Pareto distribution, but it can't even manage that! Honestly, just admit that it has a really poor distribution, it's not hard. You don't have to be a Dash zealot just because you really like the project. You can criticize a project even if you believe in it and like it. No project is perfect. You can talk about the things you like about Dash while also pointing out its shortcomings. Distribution is not a strong point for Dash, that much is obvious.

&gt; I'm sorry to say that, bluster aside time has not been good to your comment. All your talk about 'default privacy' and it turns out your coin can't do better than a coin toss.

Had I known about the ""timing"" issue at the time I probably would've phrased things a bit more delicately, but the majority of my points still stand on their own. Currently Zcash is the only other coin that has proven to have a lower probability of linking transactions, but it's not close to zero (about 31% if I recall correctly). Unfortunately it's the trusted setup that currently prevents me from trusting Zcash. If zk-starks is implemented in the future perhaps I'll reconsider my position on Zcash. Both Dash and PIVX require trust in masternodes, so while their anonymity sets may be larger (debatable as I had a hard time finding a source on this, so if you have one I'd appreciate it) their privacy is questionable at best. If you can prove otherwise I would genuinely like to read your reasoning on this.

&gt; That's just as bad as bitcoin from a computer science perspective.

That statement is yet another that places a large burden of proof on you. Do you have a degree in Computer Science? Because I do. 

Honestly man, your debate tactics are strangely aggressive for someone who doesn't offer proof to back up their very matter-of-fact statements. Usually that's a sign of someone who has only a tenuous grasp of the topic they are debating. You attack my character and call me a liar and claim the devs are lying, even though the source you provided shows the lead dev of Monero talking openly about the issue you claim he lies about. Don't call people liars unless you have actual evidence of them lying. It makes you look petulant and people are less likely to take you seriously because of it. It's a bullying tactic that suggests your position in the debate is dogmatic and less than reasonable. If you had not been so aggressive during our initial debate we probably could've had a more civil and productive conversation. I probably would've interpreted your points as more sincere, but instead you come across as a very insecure person who is weirdly interested in browbeating people on the internet who disagree with you. You constantly misconstrued or misrepresented my arguments and suggested that I'm somehow responsible for the words of people who go around trolling and fudding.

Just try having a conversation that doesn't involve name-calling or accusations of lying. You'll probably find that people are more receptive to what you're saying. It's perfectly fine if you like Dash or PIVX or whatever, but when you accompany your fanatic and overblown statements about these projects with insults and aggressive language, people tend to raise their hackles and return in kind (as I did here). I get that you've probably had many unfriendly interactions with people who talk shit about other projects and pretend that Monero is the best and flawless, so it's understandable that you have this sort of default reaction to conversations about this sort of stuff on Reddit. I just hope you understand that I'm not one of those people, and the correct way to deal with those people is not to become one of them. I'm perfectly willing to have a civil discussion about the shortcomings of Monero and various other projects, it's healthy to criticize these projects, it makes them better. I just think it's a bad idea to act with the sort of zealotry that you've displayed here. I don't view any other project as ""enemies"" that need to be defeated. I still think Monero is the best choice for practical privacy currently, as z-transactions are simply too resource intensive to warrant the small gains in privacy and the risks of the trusted setup. Maybe that will change in the future. I want Monero to be better, but I also want every privacy-focused crypto to be better. I hope Grin delivers on its promises, that would be good. I hope zk-starks comes along and delivers, that would also be good. If another crypto can prove that it's more efficient and private than Monero, I'd like that very much and would happily use it. Monero is not my religion, Dash or PIVX should not be yours. A criticism of a project is not a criticism of you personally.",1523657261

"Oh man, I really don't have the time nor the desire to continue a full debate from months ago. But I happen to be bored sitting in JFK waiting for a flight so I guess I'll go ahead and respond. I probably won't respond to any replies you may post after this. My zeal for arguing with strangers on the internet has waned recently, mostly because I'm tired of repeating myself and I'm very busy.

&gt; I have and what you said after that is false. I've argued with you guys on DNMs, r/cryptocurrency etc. and you always claim that XMR is the ""#1 privacy coin on the DNMs"" or some mess. Someone actually argued with me 'if Dash is so great why is monero the #1 coin on DNMs?'

I think you should learn how to distinguish groups from the individuals that compose groups. Just because certain Monero fans say false things doesn't mean you can just start throwing the word ""you"" around when speaking to someone else. I have never made any claim that Monero is ""#1 on the DNMs"" because that is an objectively false claim that's easily disproved. I also can't recall reading that claim anywhere on r/Monero, so just because people on DNMs or r/Cryptocurrency are making this stupid claim doesn't mean that the Monero community at large or even a significant portion of the community believes it.

&gt; It has nothing to do with the fact that you're a member of that community does it? You know? A little bias?

No, I don't make judgements about groups as a whole based on the actions of a few individuals within that group, regardless of whether I belong to that group or not. It's a stupid thing to do. I've been outspoken about scandals within the Monero community in the past. Especially when they involve influential people (i.e. Fluffypony) I don't dig group identity or groupthink in general. I call balls and strikes, especially in a group that I'm a part of because my affiliation with a group represents a threat to my integrity when prominent members of the group act in unethical or immoral fashion.

&gt; But this argument is irrelevant in relation to ZCash's privacy, which is what we were talking about. You don't have to trust anything about ZCAsh's privacy.

Fair point, I don't think Zcash's privacy is trustful, but the existence of the Trusted Setup is enough to dissuade me and many others from using it. Hopefully a blockchain in the future will implement zk-starks, that would be good.

&gt; Its not a one-to-one correlation but there is definitely a link.

If any correlation exists, it's incredibly weak. Currently value seems to be mostly driven by hype and marketing. See the insane Verge pump a few months back for a perfect example. 

&gt; This is where you guys are lying, it WASN'T FIXED and they were not open about it. They, like you, lied and said it was fixed. But in the research posted by cryptographers it is clear that the flaw went from tracing coins 90% of the time to tracing them 45% of the time. So no, it was not 'fixed'.

You're confusing two different issues. The first was the original link paper showing that transactions that happened before mixins were required were traceable. That was fixed last year. Recently, as in AFTER I wrote this post you're responding to, a new issue was brought to light, which is the ""timing"" linkability. So at the time I was making statements based on all available evidence, I was NOT lying. No one has claimed that this issue is fixed, and the lead devs HAVE been open about this. If you read the article that YOU JUST LINKED you'll see this quote from Fluffypony: *""There are steps we can take to continue to improve the sampling, but the reality is that this isn’t a solvable problem by just pecking away at it,"" he says. ""We need to have a better scheme that allows us to sample a much bigger set [of coins]."" But he also notes that the larger the set of decoy coins in every transaction, the more storage Monero requires on users' computers and the longer its transactions take. ""We're trying to find the balance,""* I don't know how much more open you can get. I haven't claimed that Monero is perfect and certainly no prominent members of the community have made this claim. This new issue of timing is a problem, it sounds like the way to fix it is to, unfortunately, go the way of Zcash (i.e. make private transactions more resource intensive). 

&gt; It is an non-argument because you have to assume that your premise is correct, which it is not. 'Default privacy' is only better than 'optional privacy' because it increases the anonymity set. There is nothing magical about it, it just makes it harder and impractical to perform various analyses. So, if your optional privacy provides a large enough anonymity set then you can have SUPERIOR optional privacy than with 'default privacy'.

Correct, and as we see with all current coins that do not have default privacy, their non-anonymous set is MUCH larger than their anonymous set. The linkability of Z-transactions within Zcash demonstrated why this is a problem. PIVX's non-anonymous set is considerably smaller than its anonymous set.

&gt; This is currently the case with PIVX and Dash. Neither of them has anywhere near a 45% chance of traceability.

Please prove this. Please also prove that the masternodes are not compromised by LE or criminal actors.

&gt; Again, this is only assuming that ALL OPTIONAL PRIVACY SCHEMES SUFFER FROM THE SAME FLAWS. Like above, this is an argument formed from an incorrect premise: MONERO'S privacy scheme was destroyed by being optional. This is because it made it easy to decrease the size of the anonymity set to the point where you can guess which mixins are the real ones. THAT IS ONLY A FLAW IN MONERO'S OPTIONAL PRIVACY. That is not an inherent property of optional privacy. That is an inherent flaw of MONERO'S privacy.

WAS a flaw, as in prior to the Spring 2017 hard fork. The anonymity set is much larger now. You can say that small anonymity sets are not an intrinsic trait of optional privacy, and that's true *in theory*, however currently cryptos that offer optional privacy have much smaller anonymous sets compared to their non-anonymous sets. So *in practice* it does appear to be an intrinsic trait. We have yet to see this change, mainly because anonymous transactions are very resource intensive. I'll be the first to admit that Monero is more traceable than most of us would prefer, but that's why it's a ""project"". It's being improved every day by many competent devs. The Github is a hive of activity. The recent timing revelations are a problem. I won't argue with you there, and neither will the devs.

&gt; No, PIVX demonstrably has a larger anonymity set than Monero. 10% of ALL PIVX held in wallets is sent to the accumulator which means that 10% of all pivx is minted as ZPIV and has no coin history. Further, Monero is vulnerable to timing attacks such that 45% of the time you can determine the traceability of a coin! PIVX has no such vulnerability.

I think you're confusing privacy and anonymity, they're two different things. Anonymity facilitates privacy, but it does not wholly compose pivacy. PIVX accumulators increase the anonymity set, obviously, but the existence of masternodes is an inherent flaw in its privacy. Having to trust a third party is a problem for any privacy-focused crypto. As I said though, PIVX seems to have a good community and devs, I'm not going to crap all over them. Just different strokes I think. Third party involvement in private transactions is a no-go for me personally, and for many others. 

&gt; Well, that's a good point. Tell us, how does your community deal with the fact that your coin was started by scammers? The largest portion of your hashrate comes from, get this, minergate which your community admits is SCAMMING unsuspecting users! So I guess your question would best be answered by yourself.

We deal with it by being open source. Like I said, anyone can verify the Monero blockchain's integrity. I'm not sure why should I care who is mining Monero. You said it yourself, the community tells people not to use Minergate. What else can the community do? Scammers will scam, but I don't have to deal with Minergate if I don't want to. They're not a part of the Monero project and they don't influence its development.

&gt; Right, except the very same thing you guys keep fud'ing the Zcash community over ACTUALLY happened to you too.

There you go again with the ""you guys"". I don't care about the Zcash community and I don't waste my time trolling them or any other community for that matter. Some people might be doing that, but that's not my problem. Most of the people I talk to on r/Monero don't care too much about other communities unless they attack Monero.

"If hashrate increases ""fast enough"", even near an initial exchange
price of zero, then a virtuous price spiral can be shown to exist ""as
long as a positive mass of agents values censorship resistance or
trustlessness"".

&gt; On the demand side, the price increases with the number of network
&gt; participants and the average *censorship aversion* value.
&gt; Furthermore, if consumers expect a higher (lower) network size in
&gt; the future, the market clearing price increases (decreases) today.
&gt; Thus, high volatility in expectations on network size will translate
&gt; into high price volatility.  This intuitive property finds a formal
&gt; representation in the closed-form expressions in Theorem 1.

The authors rely strongly on a notion of trust in the asset.  When
looking for numbers that can be measured, they pick hashrate as their
proxy for trust.  As was made clear during the Segwit2X attack and
UASF defense, those who run a full node don't have to trust the miners
to verify the blockchain.  The authors are aware of this distinction,
but don't have a completely satisfactory way to build it into their
model.  They address this in a footnote on page 8, and add a variable
in a later section.

That's a good description of Segwit... An unnecesarily complex contraption that had to be pushed as a softfork, despite its ""invasiveness"", all to avoid a simple hardfork.

You know BCH hardforks regularly, in order to upgrade the software cleanly, and to respect the consensus rules, hardforks are voluntary to run.

Really?

Because the second layer ""experiment"" over a mult-billion technology is a complete fiasco, that doesn't work in theory and it doesn't work in practice.

to commodity positions generally apply. Counterintuitively,
bitcoin transactions are as unique as physical stock certificates, which means the default identification rule of the §1012 regulations is likely to be actual delivery; however, this will often not apply
to an owner who uses a hosted wallet, and does not
control his private keys.

"Agreed.  Another thing that should be pointed out here is the incredible level of bullshit in this space (primarily found on reddit) which is targeting newcomers to crypto.  While people should evaluate their tax liability and determine how they wish to proceed, there have been a huge spate on reddit of self-professed crypto-tax experts whether on this sub or in cryptocurrency or in ethtrader, where OP has also posted (and various other so-called crypto-tax experts have posted). Some of the worst offenders are those people who have been posting all over the universe, Tyson Cross and Jason Tyra, who (like OP) have been claiming that they are crypto tax experts and they know what's good for you! Guess what.  They don't. 

Usually it goes something like this:  ""Hi, we're (insert company or service or firm name here).  My name is (name), CPA.  Blahblahblah.""  Followed by wall of text, and a claim that everybody under the sun and every single action they ever do every time they ever touch crypto must be reported to a tax authority.

Which is, of course, bullshit.

1) *DO NOT TAKE TAX ADVICE FROM RANDOs ON REDDIT (that includes me, though I hope you will not listen to OP's advice - I mean, if your solution to this is ""huh I think I should listen to StoptheVok because that entity made CryptoTaxes and StoptheVok's post got voted to top of reddit,"" then guess what: that's a really bad decision you are making! Rethink it!*

2) *DITTO FOR TWITTER OR ELSEWHERE!*

3) If you are going to get tax advice for cryptos, don't listen to me or some other schmuck hawking their P.O.V. on reddit (or twitter, etc.)! FFS, *go to some well-respected, well-recommended tax advisor, CPA and preferably tax lawyer (if you're looking at large-ish sums)*.  Depending on your country, how you have them stored, if you've ever even traded, what vehicle you have used to store / legally shield your assets, and so on, there are literally a million different ways this could go.  Alright, not a million. BUT MANY.

4) Stop listening to U.S. centric people who are shrieking at you that it must be true that it must be so that you must be taxed on every single crypto to crypto trade.  Yes, you absolutely should track all your trades and keep good records of what you do! No, you should not listen to random redditors who speak in convincing tones suggesting that you are responsible for reporting every trade you've ever made. Instead, go to a tax lawyer!

FINALLY, and this is important:  Not tax advice, but you should confirm shit for yourself and do your own homework on things like (U.S.A.) 1031 and not just believe whatever you hear people spouting about it.  For example (again: not tax advice), I can tell you, because I have researched it, that the exchange from crypto to real estate (based on new tax reform bill) is now really not allowed anymore, and that nothing has truly changed for the question of crypto-to-crypto exchanges (in the USA at least) since the IRS literally has not issued a ruling on it. _The final tax reform bill repealed the ""like-kind exchange"" rules effective to exchanges completed after 12/31/2017, but no further rules were published either to replace these (and certainly none were developed for crypto by the IRS yet)._  Which means, by the way, that crypto-to-crypto exchanges are not formally taxed unless you convince yourself that someone yakking about it on reddit can issue regulations merely by posting on reddit (but, it is easy to see, it is in the interest of people who run tax services, and self-professed crypto tax ""experts,"" to try to convince you to report as many transactions as possible regardless of whether or not each transaction is reportable, because these ""crypto-tax experts"" make more money the more that people either assess for possible reporting or ultimately report.)

BUT AGAIN! DO NOT BELIEVE THIS (That is, me) RANDOM REDDITOR OR ANY OTHER RANDOM REDDITOR ON THE SUBJECT OF TAXES!  *DO NOT TAKE TAX ADVICE FROM PEOPLE ON REDDIT!* That includes from me, since I offer no such advice, I heartily encourage and indeed demand that you go do your own damn homework, seek legal counsel (e.g. a tax lawyer), and verify independently of reddit what the heck is going on.",1523655293

"Bitcoin received a blocksize increase while an almost unbounded payment network was being built on top. Heavy shared resource users were incentivized to make their usage more efficient, and they did just that. This only worked *because* of the temporarily high fees. If we had just added more space, then a handful of companies would still be filling a significant % of the blockchain themselves. You seems to be talking about exponential increases in blocksize like it's nothing. Why are you comparing a website to the Bitcoin network? Costs aren't externalized when websites scale up, it's completely different. Websites aren't distributed. If your concept of scaling doesn't favorably change the CONOP to tx/s co-efficient then you are just increasing capacity and not really scaling at all. LN is the solution that decouples that co-efficient, or at least goes some way towards it. You should also be able to see that exponentially increasing the blocksize is simply out of consensus for the BTC community. This is why BCH even exists at all, because its' proponents simply found themselves out of consensus. In that scenario, forking off is the exact right thing to do. It's the only mechanism that exists. Bitcoin still works just like it did before (other than a now much higher value, causing fees to be exponentially more painful when measured in a quote currency). The difference now is that companies that abuse the blockchain shared resource now know that the community isn't willing to just increase the blocksize for them. They must be more efficient first.

The phrase ""put it on extreme hold"" implies that someone is in control here and making unilateral decisions. I see this attitude a lot in certain BTC communities, but the developers don't have, nor want the right to make such decisions. This is what really sets Bitcoin apart in my opinion. It is the community that decides, and they don't seem convinced (and an alternative option now exists who those that do).

LN could be used on BCH, and likely will be once that community sees the benefits (beyond scaling, that is). But for now, BCH is committed to on-chain or bust, to the point of increasing the blocksize to 32mb despite it currently being wholly unnecessary for them. It is nothing more than a signal.",1523652805

"point is, Bitcoin went through similar development with FX as in commodities. Meaning many traders look partly to shorts/longs in their opinion on trends, in determining trading direction. Meaning, the price on spot exchanges now are weighted more relatively by what's happening on the FX market. It doesn't matter in that sense if FX exchanges use corrections to index pricing from spot markets.

"But it's not going up every day. Some days it goes down. Nothing earns a set % each day. Sometimes they lose value, eliminating all of that previous compounding. So this 'perfect world' of earning a set % each day compounded every 24 hours is moot. It just doesn't happen.

That's why people use average annual compound rates, not daily rates, because the average daily rate is something like .0001%. Assets are more likely to increase annually, but daily, their value fluctuates wildly (at least in crypto in and the stock market). You're not earning 1% (or anywhere close) compounded daily in almost any asset, including crypto. It'd have to increase 38x, as people have said. And it's not the same 365% annual return; it's a 3778% return.",1523651203
"&gt; The Lightning whitepaper itself says:

&gt; &gt;    If all transactions using Bitcoin were conducted inside a network of micropayment channels, to enable 7 billion people to make two channels per year with unlimited transactions inside the channel, it would require 133 MB blocks (presuming 500 bytes per transaction and 52560 blocks per year). Current generation desktop computers will be able to run a full node with old blocks pruned out on 2TB of storage

Oh to add something here, just because I feel like countering BS today. The lightning paper also has this absolutely beautiful sentence in it:

&gt; At the same time, it is desirable to create a system which does not actively use this timestamping system unless absolutely
necessary, as it can become costly to the network

That timestamping system is *Bitcoin*.

In other words: We do not like to pay the network fees and want to avoid paying them and like to evade the fundamental assumption of Bitcoin, that transaction fees will eventually ensure its security!

"**Availability heuristic**

The availability heuristic is a mental shortcut that relies on immediate examples that come to a given person's mind when evaluating a specific topic, concept, method or decision. The availability heuristic operates on the notion that if something can be recalled, it must be important, or at least more important than alternative solutions which are not as readily recalled. Subsequently, under the availability heuristic, people tend to heavily weigh their judgments toward more recent information, making new opinions biased toward that latest news.

The availability of consequences associated with an action is positively related to perceptions of the magnitude of the consequences of that action.

"Good questions - I have no reason to donate my money directly to the projects (I actually work with some at my workplace), if I like them I will invest in them.

In general, different coins do different things. For instance, I might like Vechain for the thought of staking a node and receiving THOR power in the future once the mainnet goes live - But I wouldn't actually be using their network (As I'm not in the luxury RFID business) as far as I know.

If they expanded into RFID tagging for Law (For all I know, they already have) I would mention them specifically as a partner to use in future business opportunities.

As for the not caring about my money - Well, Crypto is speculative. You invest what you're willing to lose, pick the best, safest picks (Or the most risky, depending on what kind of investor you are) and hope for the best.

Some things like NANO or BTC/BCH that can get integrated into my personal life so I can avoid banks and the hassles that come with them, all the better. 

The second someone comes out with something that gets adopted worldwide that can replace my credit or debit card, I will smash money face first into it.

I thought I was being conservative by selling when I thought it would go down (was paranoid about crypto being a huge bubble that could go to zero at any time).

Anyway, so yes I sell whenever the TA guys I follow on Twitter agree that BTC is about to go down.  Still haven't concluded that the savings are worth all the trouble of having to follow everything 24/7, but it works at least reasonably well and perhaps most importantly I am learning a lot.  I look at trading skills as valuable life skills that will transfer certainly at least to other asset classes later in life.

Now you are risk free and you don't care if it crashed to 0.

Other methods are taking 15%, 25%, 33% profits of your gains when you have substantial increases (like you gained 3x your crypto), but you probably won't know when to do it. So you can take off 10% every week and exchange to fiat, or put a part of it into an ICO.

"While I agree with the message (Crypto needs to be simpler), the tone is entirely wrong.

Crypto should be as easy as:

- Going to the Google Play store
- Downloading a wallet for &lt;x&gt; currency
- Buying it through the wallet/app
- Using it in a store

However, saying that the only time you hear about crypto is from ""tech guys who sit in a dark room coding"" is silly.

Yes, adoption does need to happen, I think pretty much everyone knows that. Stuff is always being worked on to push easier, newer adoption into the general public.

Honestly, I don't think Crypto needs the ""largest bull run in history"" - I think the entire concept is to shape up the financial system and remove excess and waste, but sometime in the future.

Sure, everyone wants profits and things now now now, but the more interesting thing about Crypto is blockchain and its adoption into daily life - Governments using it for accounting. Businesses using it to track products. Institutions using it to record data. 

This is a generational thing as well. Older people who didn't grow up using computers will of course shy away from something generated and controlled by computers. In another generation, boomers will be gone and the people who grew up with the internet will be able to adopt Cryptos snap snap quick.

But that's a process that takes time. Most stuff is still in infancy.",1523643985

"Crypto is currently focused on institutional and business adoption. The same factors that would hold back LN/BTC for average Joe users also affect businesses and institutional entities that are interested in the tech. The article you are commenting on lays out why Pro Hashing (a prominent crypto business) didn't want to use LN/BTC:

&gt;But it's the money transmission license issue that ultimately caused us to decide not to run a Lightning Network node, and which will probably be greatest hindrance to the network's success. Everyone in the Core seems to brush this problem aside, stating that ""common sense"" means the network shouldn't be in violation or that they are working with regulators to try to convince them that it is not. The truth is that it doesn't matter what the intent of the law is or what they believe it should be; regulators can fine anyone for violations regardless of whether they are good or bad people. A money transmitter is pretty clearly defined as someone who receives money from one person and who transmits it to a different person or location. Regardless of how many Core twitter feeds try to argue against the fact, the definition of a money transmitter does not have any exclusions for whether the transmitter has ""control"" over the transmitted money or not.

&gt;The regulations are the key problem that makes the Lightning Network worthless to most companies. It's simply a case of economics. To avoid being a money transmitter, we don't accept deposits. We could make a lot of money if we did, because we have software that can take any coin in and send any coin out to a recipient, using the best path through 1000 markets in 9 exchanges. But that software can't earn back the millions of dollars to pay for the licenses, so it isn't available to the public.


&gt;Why would we run a Lightning Network node, which very clearly accepts deposits and therefore very clearly requires us to spend millions of dollars to obtain licenses? Let's assume that, as happened last December, we end up paying $500 per day in bitcoin transaction fees to pay customers who want bitcoins. If becoming a money transmitter costs the $3m I estimated, that means it would require an absurd 20 years of transaction fees before running a Lightning node would be worthwhile. On the websites advertising the Lightning Network, the pros of the network are listed as ""cheap transaction fees"" - a true statement, after you've paid the license fees or accepted the risk of fines.",1523643851
One of the incredible things about bitcoin is that it's entirely opt in. It can be something where each individual can decide at any given moment to be subject to a given monetary policy. But most things aren't like that. You can't do that with laws against violence for example. Otherwise murderers would just opt out. Currency's monetary policy and transaction regulations are one of the few things usually considered the purview of government that can be reminded entirely from it.,1523643739

"Say you borrow your neighbour's TV and sell it for $100. Then you find an IDENTICAL TV in an ad that you buy for $40. You then take the TV you bought and put it where your neighbour's TV used to be and your neighbour doesn't notice. You pocket the difference which is $60.

Now do the same thing with crypto coins (or stocks). That's shorting. And you don't actually have to borrow anything. But you do have to buy back eventually. If the price climbs instead of going down, your broker will do a margin call which will force you to sell your assets to pay for buying back the coins you sold that you didn't have.

Several margin calls at the same time will cause the price to climb because people are forced to buy. This can cause a cascading effect where it chains margin call after margin call. This is called a short squeeze.

Now ask me what options are. (Actually, please don't.)",1523643673

"This all comes down to legal issues. Anyone who’s been into crypto for 5 minuets knows that government bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are now paying attention to crypto in a big way. This legal wording is to avoid all the legal complications in this emerging space, block.one do not want to find themselves in a lawsuit as we are seeing with an increasing amount of other ICOs. Many token creators that launched ICOs are now in deep water for selling unregistered securities. 

&amp;nbsp; 

A filing from the Tezos lawsuit:
 
&gt; 
""In sum, Defendants capitalized on the recent enthusiasm for blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies to raise funds through the ICO, illegally sold unqualified and unregistered securities, used a Swiss-based entity in an unsuccessful attempt to evade U.S. securities laws, and are now admittedly engaged in the conversion, selling, and possible dissipation of the proceeds that they collected from the Class through their unregistered offering.""
&gt; 
&amp;nbsp; 

To ensure EOS tokens are not classed as a unregistered security block.one has made it clear that they are creating the EOS software only and won’t launching a public blockchain themselves. This task is left down to the community, or more precisely, the Block Producers (BPs). The following disclaimer is seen after posts from block.one:

&amp;nbsp; 
&gt;
""block.one is a software company and is producing the EOS.IO software as free, open source software. This software may enable those who deploy it to launch a blockchain or decentralized applications with the features described above. block.one will not be launching a public blockchain based on the EOS.IO software. It will be the sole responsibility of third parties and the community and those who wish to become block producers to implement the features and/or provide the services described above as they see fit. block.one does not guarantee that anyone will implement such features or provide such services or that the EOS.IO software will be adopted and deployed in any way.”
&gt;
&amp;nbsp; 

It is expected that many blockchains using eos.io software will emerge. To ensure DAPPs are created on an ecosystem that aligns with the interests of block.one a $1bn fund will be has been created to incentivise projects to use this blockchain.

"1. There are only 7 validating nodes that are all currently controlled by Neo (thereby making it VERY centralised). 

2. This centralisation tradeoff should mean that the network is incredibly robust, fast, and scalable... however, the NEO network has been down several times during times of ""high"" (put in quotation marks because it has never been anywhere near as high as eth's or btc's peaks etc.) transaction volume. For example, during the Trinity ico, the ledger froze up. Also, a couple weeks ago a single node went out of sync which caused the whole network to go down.

3. From a market standpoint, it gets shilled as ""Chinese Eth"" which means absolutely nothing since eth works just as fine in china as it does anywhere else. This kind of shilling often leads to the same people who invest in things like Tron or Verge buying which may lead to very weak hands.

4. iirc (I probably have this number slightly wrong) but last time I checked, it cost ~$8k in GAS fees to launch a smart contract on NEO... compared to Ethereum, Wan etc. that only cost ~$0.50.

"Bitcoin adoption is a complicated issue.  

While I agree with your statement on some level as it is true of all the technologies I use, and I'm not a typical user as I seek to understand everything I use enough to satisfy my curiosity.

Money is different. People inevitably think they understand money, they use is every day.

Before bitcoin is even considered as an idea you need to understand why money (fiat) is broken, Money creation is largely responsible for the wealth inequality, unrest and environmental destruction in the world today. Yet 99.9% of people are unlikely to make the connection if they don't understand how fiat is actually working. 

that said Id venture to say over 70% of people invested in bitcoin done have that insight. 

Understanding how bitcoin works and the incentives are not very complex, I'd argue it's more simple than understanding the global fiat system. 

Once you understand how bitcoin works you can take a position in it even if you don't understand how it has the potential to change everything. 

It's hard enough convincing people that bitcoin solves problems people don't think they have. Trying to explain the Lightning Network, a more complex network running on top of the Bitcoin Network, as a solution to problems bitcoin has when people can't even see the problems bitcoin solves is a losing battle.

Yes, but because of scale, whoever owns more BTC will have more connections which will get more fees. It's a centralizing force.

&gt; If miners fork themselves off, they create a new coin. But they have no one to sell it to! Remember that exchanges need to change infrastructure to support the new coin, and that is not a 5min job. Bottom line, miners mine a useless altcoin, an miss out on very valuable Bitcoin.

Yes, but I believe there would been enough people/businesses to follow their chain. It was only their fear that was preventing them.

&gt; This is along conversation, opens Pandora's box... so don't really wanna get into it. What I'll say is that if you leave markets to their own devices, the ""rich getting richer"" is the ONLY natural outcome. Someone filthy rich, would set up their own bodyguards, police, doctors, ... and leave the rest to rot on the streets. Regulations (and taxes!) are a way to avoid that. Yes, I know that taxes are a sore subject in the US, but that's what they are meant for.

Yes, it's getting into another topic entirely, but to me your scenario is the reality today. The rich are already rich and the law/military/police are used to force people to participate.

&gt; Point is... free markets most definitely lead to imbalances. So does broken regulation. But at least it's an attempt to curb the brutal survival of the fittest nature of free markets.

Yes, I don't dispute that but market corrections balance it out. I believe regulations prolong those imbalances.

&gt; I know everyone loves to hate him, but Maxwell together with others is doing great work on confidentiality and anonymity. That kind of work cannot be done with PR... and if one day BCH will adopt that, it'll have to be Greg Maxwell you'll need to thank. Because efficient confidential transactions require pushing the boundaries of CS and cryptography... marketing just won't do it.

When I say adoption, I don't mean marketing. I mean real world usage and cost of moving to another coin once you are in one. Great thing about tech is it can be copied.

Bot nets are not 1 or 10 or 100 PCs. We're talking big numbers that can really multiple hash rate. If that power is pointed to an ASIC-resistant crypto, it can have a large effect both on 51% and consensus behavior (not to mention other forms of gaming).",1523641345

"Hi.  A straight up answer to your question is YES. A Blockchain Wallet can definitely be hacked by crypto-hackers who are able to just empty your wallet once they sees an opportunity.  Another way hackers will hack a bitcoin wallet is through P2P interception.  This is not hard to do, what they would do is ask you to send them sats to another wallet as a proof that you actually own that wallet, once you have send them the sat/s they will do something called a 'draw-back-chain decrypting"" well, once this is done your Bitcoins are gone. 

I would also advise any people mostly companies who have been victim of this kind of threat most recently.  Hackers are now even working with corporates to ease this process.  So my advice for everyone would be, NOT to send even 1 sats to a wallet which you are not sure to whom it might belong to.

 This question is at the moment of international industry. Blockchain is now known to most people through cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. ,1523640913
Plus the insanely powerful bank cartel has no problems with this particular use of crypto.,1523640891
"Lightning actually scales much worse, because you can fire and forget an on-chain transaction, you can't do this with an open channel.

Lightning is like everyone running a full node, but worse. It's like everyone running two full nodes!

Here's Satoshi's thoughts on scaling:

&gt;Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe 
for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for 
double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or 
about 12KB per day. Only people trying to create new coins would need to run 
network nodes. At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the 
network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to 
specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would 
only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with 
that one node.

&gt;The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think. A typical transaction 
would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact). Each transaction has to be 
broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction. Visa processed 37 billion 
transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day. 
That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 
2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.

&gt;If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, 
sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal. 

&gt;[Satoshi Nakamoto](http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/2/#selection-67.0-107.16)

Also:

&gt;The existing Visa credit card network processes about 15 million Internet purchases per day worldwide.  Bitcoin can already scale much larger than that with existing hardware for a fraction of the cost.  It never really hits a scale ceiling.  If you're interested, I can go over the ways it would cope with extreme size.

http://plan99.net/~mike/satoshi-emails/thread1.html

&gt;&gt;The final number I'm interested in is the 500kb limit on block sizes.
According to Wikipedia, Visa alone processed 62 billion transactions
in 2009. Dividing through we get an average of 2000 transactions per
second, so peak rate is probably around double that at 4000
transactions/sec. With a ten minute block target, at peak a block
might need to contain 2.4 million transactions, which just won't fit
into 500kb. Is this 500kb a temporary limitation that will be slowly
removed over time from the official client or something more
fundamental?

&gt;A higher limit can be phased in once we have actual use closer to the limit and make sure it's working OK.

&gt;Eventually **when we have client-only implementations, the block chain size won't matter much.**  Until then, while all users still have to download the entire block chain to start, it's nice if we can keep it down to a reasonable size.

&gt;**With very high transaction volume, network nodes would consolidate and there would be more pooled mining and GPU farms, and users would run client-only.**  With dev work on optimising and parallelising, it can keep scaling up.

&gt;Whatever the current capacity of the software is, it automatically grows at the rate of Moore's Law, about 60% per year.

"Even if it was just an hour or a day, it would still just be a spike and wouldn't be that much of a problem for the miners because the bottleneck would just be temporary. 

It isn't until you have consistently high volume that the mempool will start to fill up that the fees and transactions will take time, and that is what is going to happen eventually if the volume starts increasing, with the difference being that this time Bitcoin Core will be a little bit more resiliant because of more people adopting SegWit transactions.",1523640758
"Surprise surprise, when you're shown that blockstream doesn't have commit access you start to pull an explanation out your ass about how they *do* have it, even though they dont. Now... you got some proof of this? Otherwise, if no-proof explanations are accepted I'll add this one to the competition: bcash is created by bilderberg in attempt to split the bitcoin communities and increase blocksize so its easier to control. They didn't succeed with bitcoin, so their goons Ver and Wright (who both will become rich without comparison) can control bitcoin abc (behind the curtains ofc).

Seriously though, how about we drop the tinfoil and stick to what we know, instead of making up stories?

&gt; Regarding patents, if not nChain, then it would be Bank of America and other similar companies patenting everything. So it's either nChain or BoA.

Its fine that nchain patents. Just release those patents under the DPL like blockstream, so anyone can use them. On a side note, blockstream does not have any bitcoin patents. The patents they have are related to their sidechains... and are freely available under DPL.

&gt; nChain promises everything will be available to freely use on Bitcoin Cash 

Have you not figured out why this model is incredibly problematic yet? If bcash builds on patented tech that nchain holds the keys to, then nchain effectively can decide what direction bcash takes. Remember, if anyone tries to fork it, nchain will not let them use the patents, as only the thing they call bcash may use the patents. Well, thats a problem you get to enjoy, I don't really care. If you don't think thats problematic, all the more power to you. Enjoy your patent ridden coin then.

&gt; Bitcoin Cash is making real progress while BCore stagnates adding features needed only by Blockstream, not real users.

bcash has done nothing. Increased blocksize, real impressive lol. Enabling old code. *slowclap*. Meanwhile in bitcoin schnorr, mast and bulletproofs are being developed and thousands of coding hours are being done towards lightning network. Tell me, which way do you think code is being pulled?

"&gt; There is no exact criteria. 

Exactly! So, *someone* must decide *when*. The improvements are taking too long.

&gt; I mentioned above some fairly objective criteria - a very high proportion of txs are using optimization techniques. That can be reviewed objectively on the blockchain. At that point, there won't be any efficiency to squeeze out anymore, and the only way forward will be block size increase.

Yes, I'm actually very grateful for your criteria. It gives me a platform to think in your shoes. For my view, it's based on a false premise that people need to run a non mining node.

&gt; Disagree. Why? Again, s-curve adoption. Once adoption explodes, there won't be much time to optimize.

This is why I love discussion. I was waiting for hyperbitcoinization too. Your comment made me realize that price bubbles and corrections keep that S-curve adoption in check. It won't be a sudden rush of the entire world trying to funnel into crypto.

&gt; You misunderstand the socialization of cost. Companies that move money need to pay for txs fees. If these costs are not directly passed onto customers, they are absorbed by companies. Now, if you increase the block size, these costs disappear. With small blocks and optimizations, on the other hand, companies need to spend dev $$$ to take advantage of the lower costs. Basically, big blocks externalize the cost of dev time, which small blocks force onto the company. (No free lunch... so someone must cover those costs.) That's why I'm saying ""socialization of cost, but privatization of profit"". Companies certainly don't share their profits with node operators!

I think here too stems from the different view of what a node is.

&gt; Funny, you just admitted to wanting to leech off Core's work... but then r-btc is very keen on bashing everything Core does!

I'm just saying what I think will happen. I don't participate in those negative threads. I want bitcoin cash to just move forward and work on the positive things. I can't force that. In terms of human work, adoption cannot be copied or forced. Say BTC puts in 1000 hours of human work into coding. BCH puts 1000 hours of human work into adoption. At this point, both chains are even in the amount of human work hours put in. On BTC, now that certain people are satisfied with the efficiencies, it's time for adoption. On BCH, 500 human work hours are put into integrating the efficiencies of BTC into BCH. BCH now has, in effect, 2000 human work hours, while BTC has 1500 human work hours (HWH). The example is flawed in that BTC has a head start but I'm betting that adoption HWH will happen faster than the dev HWH as there are more people working on BCH adoption over BTC dev work. With regards to BCH in the example, you can swap it out with anything else.

&gt; in any event, my post on Proof of HUMAN Work, linked elsewhere, should put this in perspective. Yes, everything can be copied, but you'll need to find bodies to do it. People dedicating their time to do it. And don't say ""someone will do it!""... that's wishful thinking, not a serious plan. Trust me, if you make these kinds of comments at work, to your boss or even higher up, you'll never get promoted. You need to tell people exactly HOW are you gonna address a problem,. And that's difficult. Alas, most of the narrative around big blocks I can hear is always ""TECH will improve! Stuff will get done! We're on-board!"", but no one is actually putting forward any specific proposals.

Yes, I agree with you. I know there are believers in bitcoin cash and we are putting in the work. In the same vein, I don't think the devs to work fast enough to outpace adoption in terms of HWH.

"Bitcoin open source implementation of P2P currency

P2P Foundation

2009-02-11 22:27:00 UTC - Original Post

I've developed a new open source P2P e-cash system called Bitcoin. It's completely decentralized, with no central server or trusted parties, because everything is based on crypto proof instead of trust. 

The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts. Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible.

A generation ago, multi-user time-sharing computer systems had a similar problem. Before strong encryption, users had to rely on password protection to secure their files, placing trust in the system administrator to keep their information private. Privacy could always be overridden by the admin based on his judgment call weighing the principle of privacy against other concerns, or at the behest of his superiors. Then strong encryption became available to the masses, and trust was no longer required. Data could be secured in a way that was physically impossible for others to access, no matter for what reason, no matter how good the excuse, no matter what.

It's time we had the same thing for money. With e-currency based on cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman, money can be secure and transactions effortless.

One of the fundamental building blocks for such a system is digital signatures. A digital coin contains the public key of its owner. To transfer it, the owner signs the coin together with the public key of the next owner. Anyone can check the signatures to verify the chain of ownership. It works well to secure ownership, but leaves one big problem unsolved: double-spending. Any owner could try to re-spend an already spent coin by signing it again to another owner. The usual solution is for a trusted company with a central database to check for double-spending, but that just gets back to the trust model. In its central position, the company can override the users, and the fees needed to support the company make micropayments impractical.

Bitcoin's solution is to use a peer-to-peer network to check for double-spending. In a nutshell, the network works like a distributed timestamp server, stamping the first transaction to spend a coin. It takes advantage of the nature of information being easy to spread but hard to stifle. 

The result is a distributed system with no single point of failure. Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly with each other, with the help of the P2P network to check for double-spending.

"&gt; Actually no one at blockstream has merge access.

It is set up to appear that way but everyone knows the truth. Taking away Gavin's access was the final step in establishing full control.

Devs with merge access have ties to Blockstream / Chaincode / MIT Media Labs Digital Currency initiative but these are all closely related companies funded by the same people.

Regarding patents, if not nChain, then it would be [Bank of America](https://news.bitcoin.com/bank-america-filed-cryptocurrency-patents-company/) and other similar companies patenting everything.

"&gt; The one being dishonest is you, my post history is open record, double posting happens with extreme infrequency and only happens to get around downvote brigades. Claiming it is something that happens with any kind of frequency is extremely dishonest. For comparison, I've probably made 20 or so threads, only 1-2 of which I've reposted, both times to get around shadow bans.

Oh yes boo hoo poor you, everything is a conspiracy :) getting around the shadows bans that you recieved because you break the rules.

&gt; No, you are wrong. I directly quoted to you the several places where the paper indicates that RingCT does NOT fix the issue. You can be in denial all you like, your money.

Still nope, they claim that RingCT doesn't matter yet they are not able to use transactions with RingCT in their numbers. Shows their bias.

&gt; Man this has been done to death! There have been so many posts refuting this notion that the fact that you even bring it up should be considered spam. Like IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. Whatever wild speculation you use to justify your hatred of Dash DIDN'T HAPPEN. Evan wasn't the only one mining, the coin was worthless and almost immediately dumped as THE BLOCKCHAIN SHOWS. Yes its written history but I'm not going to do your research, of course you already know all this but you're hoping that a noob that reads this doesn't.

LOL yes ""it didn't happen"" you are one good cultist, damn Evan must be pround of you. It is not proven at all, Evan most likely holds the majority of these coins today. But yea I know..since Evan ""claims"" that he doesn't, it must be true... the Dash cult &amp; the typical logic of it.

&gt; So, who else is complaining about it? Only your community, completely unaffiliiated with Dash, seems to care about an issue that stopped affecting the network years ago. Your privacy is still broken however.

Consensus in the cryptocurrenmcy community is that Dash is a scam, hence why you get downvoted when you shill/fud your stuff in /r/cryptocurrency. Not just the Monero community, most communies.

&gt; I'm not telling myself anything! Who do you know only uses their wallet to receive one transaction? And then mixes and doesn't touch it again? THOSE are the conditions for use. It doesn't work against funds that have already been mixed. They admit this in the paper. It doesn't work outside of that narrow edge case. Which means its a non-issue. If you can't use it then its not a vulnerability. A theoretical exploit is in no way in the same league as this privacy-breaking timing analysis, come on dude!

They said, it remains to be seen if it works in practice and the timing analysis doesn't work on Monero with all of its fatures, only on decoy inputs 1/3 privacy features.

&gt; LMAO i have never seen someone try so hard to change the subject! Kudos. But the fact is the monero GUI wallet just came out very recently and before that the only wallet with any sort of usability was this closed-source wallet by lead developer fluffyPony.

Well I mean the GUI has been out what? A year? Not very recently, by those standards the few years between now and the Dash scam start shouldn't be seen as much either. Atleast it should be considered fairly recently.

&gt; Man, you guys are just so full of shit it's sickening. Here are several items done from a 1 sec google search all that clearly refer to fluffy pony as 'lead developer' of Monero:

Oh yea, you will be able to find tons of people who believe that he is infact the lead dev, doesn't make it so.

&gt; But it did inherit the huge premine, Vitalik said he was able to get up to $6000 /day using his optimized miner, which means that someone else released the cripplemined code and intended to profit from it too.

Oh yes the founder of another currency said...so that must mean that it's true. Yes someone did, under the name Bitmonero, that guy went bye bye. So you are ok with your own creater/cultleader/god premining half of the Dash supply, saying ""who is it hurting or scamming?"" meanwhile some old dev that got kicked from Monero did something similar, yet less serious and it's a huge deal? You can't stand consistent to saved your own life.

&gt; Just trust us, right? Are there any cryptographic proofs that the current dev team is not related to that 'one guy'?

Oh yea just like ""just trust us, Evan didn't keep any coins, because uhm he said so"". 

&gt; Whom did Evan cheat? Oh and btw, he wasn't made the leader, he created the coin. The people monero cheated are obvious of course, their own community through the cripplemine scam. No wonder you guys harp so much on the early days of Dash, you were born in scam and will never be able to grow beyond that mentally, like a sort of crypto-oedipus complex

So yea, how do you want it? ""The cripplemine cheated the Monero community"", but the cult leader of Dash premining his own coin spawns the question ""who did he cheat?"" LOL you are just too much, do you even think about what you write? And yes I know Evan created Dash, but the fact that you accept him as a leader when his creation is a scam, is just nuts. So he wasn't ""made"" the leader, he made himself ""the leader"", that is in no way better. Read it as ""accepted as leader"" then instead.

&gt; This is word salad.

Your bad reading comprehension does not = me writing word salad. I guess i struck a nerv when I mentioned that Dash isn't even considered as anything more than a scam by the general crypto community. Sad for you, but true. Everyone knows about your scheme.

&gt; “In the above experimental setup, we started from a single premixing address holding Dash. In reality, users may obtain Dash in multiple installments and hold these coins in their wallet in a manner that is not easily linkable to each other. Relying on this is unwise for privacy, as it is a form of security through obscurity; nevertheless, it is a factor that will significantly hurt the accuracy of the attack in practice

Oh and still, none of that means that it can't be done. No matter how you twist it.

&gt; Uh huh, and here is what your boss, fluffyPony ACTUALLY had to say for the article, notice how he doesn't lie to them. Almost like he knows he is not allowed to lie like this guy above is trying so hard to do:

Funny, nowhere in that quote do I see him saying ""yes Monero is 45% traceable"" like you are claiming, strange isn't it? So Fluffy is essentially saying ""Monero isn't perfect"" and that there is still work to be done and you somehow manage to twist and spin that to fit in your own agenda. Damn, what was your dayjob before you joined the trollfactory?

&gt; Guess what? Dash has that better scheme already. PIVX does already. Nowhere in his post does he throw the usual garbage responses you see on here, that's how you know they're garbage lies. He doesn't point anyone in the article to the 'unofficial response paper' (LOL). He has measured, realistic comments that basically accept that Monero's privacy is broken. This report is not about 'theoretical' attacks, they stated they were able to identify individual coins. That is DAMNING for a privacy coin. There is no coming back from this.

A comment taken completely out of context, he is obviously talking about ring signatures only, not the entire coin. Again spin away, lie, cheat and manipulate in hopes of promoting your pyramid-scheme Dash. Keep trying to discredit Monero and keep getting laughed at. You know that you are seen as a nutcase and total fking muppet in /r/cryptocurrency right? The thing is Masterminded or Dashguy or whoever you are, that people don't care about your bullshit propaganda, as long as people know that you are affiliated with the Dash scam, no one will take you seriously. Be sad, be mad, I don't care. And that leads me to my conclusion:

This conversation is leading nowhere, not a single person is reading these long ass posts but the two of us, so any hope on you spreading your lies here are in vain. I suggest you go back to double &amp; tripple posting FUD in every thread you come across 24/7, because arguing with me is not visible enough for your agenda anyway.

"Here's my thoughts...

Right now, we are in ""adopter FOMO"" portion of the start of the bull run. So many people waiting on sidelines timing the floor. The more green days we have coming up, the more of that money jumps in. That money is more likely to go back into projects they once were in. For that reason, I think this bull season is going to start off with a non-typical altcoin run with BTC gaining, but maybe half as much as good solid alts.. and likely some verges too :( 

However, in another month or two or five, when the average person starts hearing about the bitcoin phoenix rising from the ashes, they are going to get back in. Those people are going to come in riding the BTC. 

When that happens, the current holders will hop off their alts and try to ride the BTC bull for as long as it runs.

So I could be nuts but...

I think you want to be in good alts right now. Maybe 10-15% BTC at most. Good positions in stuff like ETH/NEO/OMG/VEN/ICX/NANO/WAN, or whatever your solid projects are.

When new money comes in after hearing about the market turn, they will go into BTC. So watch for some big BTC days in a few weeks or a month from now, then get half your alt money back into BTC for that run. Go up to maybe 50% or higher BTC for the ""new money rush"".

Once that dies back out, and BTC start hitting high fees and long transaction times again (sure sure LN, etc, yeah right like Sally Busdriver is going to be setting up LN nodes), then move back into alts for another alt season.

Then once hype is maxing out, take profits and brace for the correction and ""bubble pop"".

In my mind,  when btc recovers,  and my alts go back to their previous aths, I'm not really thanking btc for that.  I'm thankful that my fortune is changing,  but i also understand that as soon as we no longer need btc as an on ramp,  my alts will move dependant on their own merits.  Which is a much more lucrative case for me,  considering my alts are much more meritorious than dusty ol btc.

"&gt;Virtually all off them are faster and cheaper. 

Untrue. Dash for instance, which is one of the least expensive is more expensive to use than BC. So is ETH. So is Monero. So is BTC. So are most of the major alt coins.

&gt;You can say BCH has 0 conf well any shitcoin can implement either that or instant send at the expense of security.

For 99%+ of practical purposes, 0 conf *does not compromise security*. Yes, I would sell a house or a bag of groceries with 0 conf. If you don't understand why I would say that, you probably haven't heard the arguments.

&gt;And I doubt a user will make a distinction between a 0.00X cents fee and 0.0000X cents and always use the cheaper fee regardless of other variables.

You're looking at prices at current rates of transactions. As transactions increase, this difference becomes meaningful. Back in December, Dash cost $0.15 to use while BCH cost order of magnitude less than $0.01 to use.

Paying a $0.15 tax every time you buy a $5 sandwich is considerable. And that difference only increases as usage goes up.

&gt;Is a transaction spam or invalid if it pays the fee?

It is valid is it pays the fee, by definition.

&gt;How can you say a network with few transactions has more use than one with many transactions?

Greater Use =/= Greater Usability

More people buy overpriced stocks to try and increase their purchasing power than buy underpriced stocks. That doesn't mean that overpriced stocks are more ""usable"" for increasing your purchasing power. They are not. They are demonstrably *less useful* for that purpose, but people currently do it anyway.

Sometimes, people do irrational things. Often, because they have a poor education on a subject, often due to propagandized ""education"".

&gt; IMO the smaller the fees, the harder it is to determine fake volume.

Fortunately you don't get to determine what ""real"" and ""fake"" volume is. If someone is willing to pay a fee, it is by definition, a ""real"" transaction.",1523637196

"TBH, I don't know.
When I first got into this game, it was on the back of extreme FOMO.
I learned a lot, very quickly, made a lot of mistakes, silly posts to this sub, got confused etc.


The sudden market downtrend woke me up. I held my assets through that and learned more, switching my portfolio to investments which showed the most promise.


In this game, anything can happen - and my expectations may be way short of the mark either way. 


What I have learned, is that it's a long game - there's no quick bucks unless you are lucky - very lucky. There's plenty of people pretending they are super smart investors **because** they got lucky - but back in October/November and early December, **any** sucker could've made a killing by timing the market right.


As far as I am concerned, rather than dwelling on ""the right time, the right place"", it's best to focus realistically on investment goals - and there's just soooo much to learn about how to invest wisely. I'm just scratching the surface. 


Pick your assets carefully, based on research. Hold them, keep an eye on markets, trade in and out between them, drop assets for others if you need to, but prepare for a long game with many ups and downs.


Any noob who got in during December and now has a portfolio that didn't see great loses is possibly in a good position to keep learning.


Some would say we're in for a bull market and some will play this game so much better than I ever could, whatever, I'm playing it the only way I know how currently - carefully, with no emotion (anymore) and without stupid expectations. 


I'm sticking to my guns, I got through the shitstorm that was Feb/March and into April and expect more shit at some point - my assets are sound coins and like most of them, they are in early investor territory. 


My 2x or 50% is pretty much based on maybe one or two of them performing well for the long term.


Heck, if one of them hits the big time and does a BTC or an ETH on me, oh my God, wouldn't that be nice. :D",1523637099

Full quote [here](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=93366.msg1031394#msg1031394).

If miners fork themselves off, they create a new coin. But they have no one to sell it to! Remember that exchanges need to change infrastructure to support the new coin, and that is not a 5min job. Bottom line, miners mine a useless altcoin, an miss out on very valuable Bitcoin. 

&gt;Because people have been coddled their entire life. No one has any self responsibility. Funny thing is, I used to have the same view as you. I realized that politically, the rich are getting richer so, in my view, regulations aren't working. It was in the past but the rich just lobby/bribe to dismantle it. It's possible it could be a cultural thing. We have people here voting against their own interest because they are misled.

This is along conversation, opens Pandora's box... so don't really wanna get into it. What I'll say is that if you leave markets to their own devices, the ""rich getting richer"" is the ONLY natural outcome. Someone filthy rich, would set up their own bodyguards, police, doctors, ... and leave the rest to rot on the streets. Regulations (and taxes!) are a way to avoid that. Yes, I know that taxes are a sore subject in the US, but that's what they are meant for.

Point is... free markets most definitely lead to imbalances. So does broken regulation. But at least it's an attempt to curb the brutal survival of the fittest nature of free markets.

&gt;How do you really measure that?

Easy: Github commits. Research papers published. 

I know everyone loves to hate him, but Maxwell together with others is doing great work on confidentiality and anonymity. That kind of work cannot be done with PR... and if one day BCH will adopt that, it'll have to be Greg Maxwell you'll need to thank. Because efficient confidential transactions require pushing the boundaries of CS and cryptography... marketing just won't do it. 

Look at how much research is going in crypto. By far and large, like by a million years ahead, it is for Bitcoin and ETH. Massive advantage. I'd say impossible to catch up to.

"RBF messes with the incentive structure. If someone sends me a RBF transaction it's non-obvious what it is and they can simply send a higher one immediately after to themselves. You would have to reject all 0-confs if you tried to not accept RBF transactions.

I love that you don't understand 0-conf. 0-conf has always been about a risk-reward relationship, and that is an idea from Satoshi himself. On smaller transactions, accept 0-conf because it's difficult if not impossible to reliably double-spend, if it's a higher value, then wait 10 seconds and a double-spend is impossible but if you want to, wait 10 more seconds. If you think you do understand it, why don't you just do it then? r/btc thread named ""or_anyone_confident_you_can_pull_a_double_spend/"" (I don't know how to post a link to another subreddit here without the auto-mod removing it)

Here's what the Co-Founder posted:

""This is how a double spend would work if anyone could pull it off:

1) pay for the gift card using x amount of fee 2) do a second transaction from the same wallet right after it to an address in your control, including a higher amount of fee 3) because of the higher fee, the second transaction will get confirmed faster, making the first transaction invalid. So you end up with the coins you send with the first transaction, and a 1000$ gift card.

If you are confident this will work, you shouldn't have a problem with paying double. That money never reaches me.""",1523636704

To resolve the issue in the future, we have imposed higher order size minimums when fees get outrageous, so if Bitcoin mining fees are $50, we won't let someone do a Bitcoin order that is less than, say, $250.  But then of course people complain about not being able to do smaller orders ;)",1523636631
"&gt;Lol, because no one cares how many ""teams"" there are. What matters about decentralization is the consensus. Instant forced hard fork are not consensus.


And BTC follows consensus? 94% of the miners wanted to upgrade the blocksize, all of the original devs (since kicked out of the core club because they didn't agree with the new corrupt developers), except 1-meg (since quit) and cobra (since changed his mind), wanted to upgrade the blocksize and the vast majority of the community wanted lower fees via a blocksize increase. Instead of following consensus, a development team of a handful of people, with very close ties to blockstream pushed through segwit which had 20% of the miner minority, and no real community support outside of /r/bitcoin.

Also, if it hadn't been for the ddos attack (orchestrated by hardcore BTC shills), that took down every major exchange for up to 9 hours, when BCH was at 0.5 the pure buy volume left in the order book alone would have been enough to bring BCH to 2 BTC easily. ",1523636627

"I'm a freelancer journalist in the city, I interviewed Dr. Soltys and we discussed these topics and his views on crypto. 

Nothing magical about his observations. I was sent this chart. Red area is people short-selling Bitcoin, darker area in black is longs contracts. This is short-term but Dr. Soltys states this has been happening since January. But the red area has been increasing since January and price was falling. Over the last few days the red area was increasing at a rate of $25-50 million dollars (USD) daily in efforts to push Bitcoin price down but we didn't go down. Per Dr. Soltys the price was getting more and more expensive to keep down, hence anticipation that we would surge up very quickly soon. He states his assumptions were correct, if look closely the red area sharply drops at the end, 38,000 contracts to 24,000 which is $116,000,000.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/Tw9ryFqn/

Dr. Soltys believes that if these sellers decide to cash in further and ""rollover"" on those shorts we will soar thousands of dollars in just a few days. When these sellers end their short-sell trades, their actions will be two-fold, 
1) remove the sell pressure
2) buy-to-cover to end short-sell trades

People who believe in BCH don't want to buy it, they're waiting for a better price.

Also the propaganda does it's job. Very few people actually want to have anything with a thing that someone somewhere called a scam. They fear BCH becoming another BitConnect.

Lastly, there's Bitmain which owns insanely huge amount of BCH, and I personally dread the day Bitmain starts selling those accomulated coins.

On the other hand, adoption is a slow process. It would take years for BCH to reach LTC adoption levels. In the meantime, downward pressure on the price is super high, and nothing can pump BCH back to 0.2 or 0.3 BTC. I wouldn't want to be in Roger Ver's skin right now.

It's going to be a great second half of 2018. I predict this bull run lasts right until Jan again, when we'll have nearly the exact same thing happen all over again.",1523635906

"**Tyranny of the majority**

Tyranny of the majority (or tyranny of the masses) refers to an inherent weakness of direct democracy and majority rule in which the majority of an electorate can and does place its own interests above, and at the expense of, those in the minority. This results in oppression of minority groups comparable to that of a tyrant or despot, argued John Stuart Mill in his famous 1859 book On Liberty.

Potentially, through tyranny of the majority, a disliked or unfavored ethnic, religious, political, social, or racial group may be deliberately targeted for oppression by the majority element acting through the democratic process.

American founding father Alexander Hamilton, writing to Thomas Jefferson from the Constitutional Convention, argued the same fears regarding the use of pure direct democracy by the majority to elect a demagogue who, rather than work for the benefit of all citizens, set out to either harm those in the minority or work only for those of the upper echelon.

Anyway, inside Brave is something called ""Brave Payments"". When a user enables Brave Payments, it will generate a crypto wallet in the browser. The balance of this wallet can be used to donate to websites, content creators (Twitch streamers, YouTubers, etc.) every month, much like Patreon or subscriptions on Twitch. 

This wallet has several ways of getting ""topped up"" (funding options). Right now it has ETH, LTC, BTC and BAT. This would add BCH as a funding option as well for the in-browser wallet. Again, the browser has over 2M+ active users now. This is up around 600k for a month or two ago! Growing fast!

"&gt; Don't be surprised, or annoyed, if people talk about BCash.

Oh, I'm not. I get that it gets to other people so people call it bcash. I don't mind in part because it makes it easy to filter out low effort comments. 

&gt; Yes, I never claimed the opposite. There are people who truly believe to be the reincarnation of Napoleon or Marcus Aurelius. They are generally locked up in white cells. There are also people who truly believe the Earth is flat (flat Earthers, Google them). Does not make it so.

Hahaha that's true. I am for the principle of bitcoin which is a peer-to peer electronic cash system.

&gt; If I can deposit $1,000 in a certain channel, and pay a $30 fee, that's the same as using credit cards today. Because CC fees are ~3-5%.

When I got into bitcoin, it was about empowering the poor. The poor can't afford that. What the forced fee market will do is create two tiers of people, those who can afford fees and those who cannot.

&gt; Incorrect. If miners attack it, nothing will happen. The proof is in the pudding - S2X failed, and was supported by ~85% of the hashing power! Full nodes impose the rules of the game.

Because they got irrationally scared. Too much living in a state run society. If they did fork with 85% hash power, their chain will survive and the other won't. That's why Mike Hearn quit, because the weakness of bitcoin stemming from social upbringing prevented in allowing more TX for the network. 

&gt; Well, that is technically correct. We've paid a very hefty price for that self regulation. You know the 1%? They are the result of that ""self regulation"". I'm very close to that world, and it will happily rip your face off, if you let it. And not regulating is exactly that. Think all the elderly being predatory targeted by Wall St to get their pension taken. Do you know why it doesn't happen? Regulations. Remove them, and I'll talk to you after YOUR parents have been ""talked into really lucrative investments"".

Because people have been coddled their entire life. No one has any self responsibility. Funny thing is, I used to have the same view as you. I realized that politically, the rich are getting richer so, in my view, regulations aren't working. It was in the past but the rich just lobby/bribe to dismantle it. It's possible it could be a cultural thing. We have people here voting against their own interest because they are misled.

&gt; Proof of HUMAN work. Show me one other coins with as much HUMAN work behind, and I'll start to be concerned.

How do you really measure that? Like I said, BTC is coasting on the human work put in before and being first. We'll see in 5 years!

Plenty of fees if every on-chain fee is $10.

&gt;They can try to enforce it but they won't be able to. Maybe on a small scale like taking one miner down. It won't have much effect since crypto is worldwide and miners will emerge where there isn't regulation.

With giant mining operations that's pretty easy to achieve... that's exactly what banks the world over are, huge institutions processing txs. And they are collectively regulated by a few bodies. Sure, some differences, but they all talk to each other.


Bitcoin is either decentralized, like a swarm of bees, or it'll die as an idea. I've also said this before.. personally, I trust central banks more than I trust miners to run my monetary policy. So I don't want to see any centralization whatsoever. My perfect situation? We could all run a full node on our phones, in ~10yrs. THAT's decentralization.

"Oh, I believe most of those international analysis systems are already firmly in place at the state level. Stitching together a profile based on access to banking records, IP addresses, phone accounts, and more definitely makes the job a lot easier.

The caveat to all this is that Bitcoin is not the only game in town and other coins and tokens will further obfuscate linking ownership and transactions to individuals. That said, it’s not like the world’s economy is frozen under current conditions where the private sector knows all about your money and will easily give that info up to the State. ",1523633699

The publicity would also be good for the market as a whole, as it would bring a huge amount of public attention. 

That said, I don't think it would be good for the market in the long-term because it would bring in a lot of people who don't know what they're doing. Trump also has a poor business track record, which wouldn't bode well for the crypto he partnered with. ",1523633627

I am not saying I trust them more than other places.  Merely that they are giving away increased free bitcoin daily due to the low price of bitcoin currently and its smart to take advantage of it.,1523633433
"The story is seven years long. Here’s the most possible condensed version: 

Bitcoin was intended to scale on chain. Transactions on a worldwide ledger. Decentralized through nodes. Peer to peer.  

A corporation came in and bought off the top bitcoin developers. Convinced them to force transactions off-chain into their own for-profit transaction processing hubs. 

So they can get filthy rich off of bitcoins usage. 

The community mutinied. Bitcoin cash was created to restore peer to peer decentralized on-chain transactions. With no corporate corruption. 

Blockstream has literally an army of people online that troll, down vote, and spread misinformation. I’ve never seen conspiracy theories like that actually play out in real life.",1523633420
Blockstream would’ve made more money if they allowed the blocks to get bigger and by building the best bitcoin. They messed up. ,1523633373

"If the Bitcoin crash ends now, and we go straight to a bull run, we could be looking at a stellar run, and I wouldn't be surprised if Bitcoin hits close to $30K this time.

What many people have lost sight of, is Bitcoin at $8K would be already starting at a strong position, at over 700% from a year ago, and over double what it was before the late 2017 spike. That means it had a lot of resistance, and the support was strong. I really still expect another big dip before a bull run. Either way, there's been a lot of money standing idle on the side line waiting to see what happens with the crash, waiting for the dust to settle. When all that money jumps back in, we could see another serious bull run, but this time with $8K as the starting base, instead of $3-4K. ",1523633047
"It really doesn't matter - it's just perspective.

Look at alts in terms of BTC or ETH just puts your alt investment in comparison to leaving your money as BTC or ETH (i.e. lets you easily see the opportunity cost of investing in an alt).  The only reason it is those two, is because that's what exchanges use.  Does anyone care about the value of their alts in NEO?  Or VEN?  or NANO?  See - it doesn't matter, it's just a relative measure.

Looking vs. USD does have a few distinct advantages though:

1)  It helps you judge the value of your investment vs. your initial investment.  When you first bought in to crypto, you had to use some fiat pairing.

2)  It decouples your wildly varying alts from a wildly varying BTC or ETH - thus making it easer to see value changes.  (e.g. if BTC goes down 10% in USD and your alt keeps its USD value, then your sats have gone up but the real-world value of them has not - that is, buying them with USD/EUR/whatever is still at the same price).

3)  It allows you to better realize the value of your holdings.  This is good for both comparing your crypto money to real life products you can buy (for example - let's say you want to buy that lambo, do you pay in USD or BTC?) and let's you compare your crypto assets better in terms of your overall investments.

"&gt; Ok 51% attack, there is no such thing as sybil attack with PoW.  

Technically, you're correct, but the stolen nature of the hash rate makes it very Sybil like to me. It subverts Bitcoin's governance by weakening the Proof-of-Work aspect.  

&gt; Have you ever mined a ASIC resistant cryptocurrency?  

I have indeed. But in either CPU or GPU cases, their or cryptocurrencies that make themselves easier targets. In the CPU case, there are the GPU resistant cryptos, or the ones that modify algos such that custom GPU software isn't keeping up. On the ASIC resistant, but GPU friendly, there are still vastly more unsecured PCs with reasonable or powerful GPUs connected, than there are unsecured ASIC miners.  

My point simply is, in every instance an extensive ASIC secured crypto is less susceptible to malicious/bot mining antics than ASIC/GPU resistant cryptos.  

&gt; That bring no benefits, actually some decentralisation is gone. (Neutral hash power is good)  

I didn't say the benefits might not have other trade offs, but there are truly benefits.  

I feel like we just will have to agree to disagree here. We've both made our points. Is there something we haven't already discussed on this issue?",1523632939

"&gt; Bitcoin's biggest asset: Proof of HUMAN work.

&gt; Bitcoin Cash, and all the other coins out there, have this as biggest disadvantage compared to Bitcoin. If you don't energize people to start building shit in the BCH ecosystem, you just won't be able to compete. And you are at a significant disadvantage right now. Ignore at your own peril.

People are working on adoption. Because I believe it's supposed to be a usable currency, I'm not just sitting around like I was with BTC. 

&gt; What if I use hubs outside of the US? Do you think Venezuelan hubs will comply with US laws? Or Syrian hubs? Iranian? North Korean? They will ignore all that just to spite the US!

That's assuming the routing issue is solved.

&gt; LN is not PoS because LN is not trying to achieve consensus. With LN there is no global consensus! That is, if me and you open a channel, nobody will even know how much do I have and how much do you have... the definition of no consensus.

I meant it as TX processing and network security not for achieving consensus. 

&gt; Sure. And I think that's where the fundamental difference lies. And, I'm afraid, it's an irreconcilable one. I told you about banks being left to their own devices prior to 2008. In this case, IF big blocks are no good enough, we fucked up, and I'm not sure we get another chance.

Yes, a fundamental disagreement. Market corrections are a natural part of the free market. If big blocks are a failure, then necessary changes will be adopted because everyone's investment into the coin.

&gt; Accountants are businesses...

Bad phrasing on my part. Miners are a TX processing business. Actually they are one and the same. 

&gt; This is a naive view. You can already see how ""the blockchain industry"" is starting to form ""self regulatory"" bodies. It's happening in the UK and in Japan. Prob in the US as well. (Again, Google it.) It's only a matter of time before miners start forming ""self regulatory"" bodies, or ""industrial alliances"". Especially if they keep on being giant mining operations. And then it becomes extremely easy for governments to start regulating them, and imposing whatever they will.

They can try to enforce it but they won't be able to. Maybe on a small scale like taking one miner down. It won't have much effect since crypto is worldwide and miners will emerge where there isn't regulation.",1523632782

"Just about all exchanges have at least one token which would be classified as a security on their exchange. The SEC has not (yet) come out and said which coins are securities, and how they are exactly classified. However, a good way to determine it is, did that coin have an ICO? 99% of the time, if that coin had an ICO, the SEC would favor it being a security token. An example of a coin that the SEC might not look at even though it once was an ICO, is Ethereum, although that's still just speculation. There is no true answer to this yet from the SEC.
With that said though, centralized exchanges will be regulated just like the stock exchanges in the coming years, especially once large banks (BoA for example) start opening crypto trading. Some exchanges including our upcoming Bitmora Exchange, Coinbase, and Poloniex (bought by Circle), are all taking the first steps to registering in certain ways to be fully legal in the US. This is a lengthy process that might take the SEC months to come to a decision on, and possibly even years if a crypto exchange attempts to register as a National Exchange. However, once the first few exchanges register the SEC it will allow for more adoption and liquidity on them because of the trust produced by regulation.",1523632733

"Cheers to the discussion man.

But you're making some patently false statements now. ""You can't yourself deny that advertisement for crypto is borderline on the same standard as advertisement for kids cereals."" Umm, one of the most sugary, unhealthy foods ever marketed to children, and by extent ill-informed and misled parents? That's not remotely close to crypto. Anyone who invests in crypto is making their own financial decisions with their own money and is not being forced into anything. The ads targeted to kids are shitty, but ultimately their parents have all the purchasing power and are the ones feeding their children. Calling all crypto enthusiasts, who may happen to be young, ""clearly not developed"" is wildly inaccurate. 

This honestly is more related to my earlier point; less educated people are more susceptible to jumping into things without doing their research. So many people were buying in at all time highs during November - January, who had little to no idea about the technology. Those same people probably sold 2 weeks ago and are now FOMOing back in. Coinsquare's target audience is not these people, however. Their largest demographic is comprised of millennial males, largely young professionals, (many of whom live and work around Toronto) between the ages of 20-30. This ad is eye catching, but isn't going to make some informed person go throw their money away in something they haven't researched.

You're criticizing marketing, but admit it's inherent in our capitalist society. You market to your TARGET demographic(s). Heart medication is marketed to those of the age wherein heart disease is most prevalent. Likewise, Viagra and Cialis aren't marketed to 20 year olds, now are they? Crypto is being embraced overwhelmingly by millennials, so it is no surprise then that the marketing would be in line with that. If you have a problem with a society which utilizes advertisements and marketing to generate revenue, that's a whole different discussion, but simply calling a company out for targeting their largest customer base makes no sense in my opinion.",1523632524

Yes, I never claimed the opposite. There are people who *truly believe* to be the reincarnation of Napoleon or Marcus Aurelius. They are generally locked up in white cells. There are also people who *truly believe* the Earth is flat (flat Earthers, Google them). Does not make it so.

&gt;You running your own node does nothing for the collective of the network. If there is a hard fork you disagree with and everyone else forks off, you are left with essentially an altcoin. But if miners attack it, there be a fork.

Incorrect. If miners attack it, nothing will happen. The proof is in the pudding - S2X failed, and was supported by ~85% of the hashing power! Full nodes impose the rules of the game.

&gt;2008 crisis is the market regulating its self.

Well, that is technically correct. We've paid a very hefty price for that self regulation. You know the 1%? They are the result of that ""self regulation"". I'm very close to that world, and it will happily rip your face off, if you let it. And not regulating is exactly that. Think all the elderly being predatory targeted by Wall St to get their pension taken. Do you know why it doesn't happen? Regulations. Remove them, and I'll talk to you after YOUR parents have been ""talked into really lucrative investments"".

This libertarian view of the world is as flawed as it gets. Hope you'll one day get it.

"Much of the world population does not have access to bank accounts.  Bitcoin allows everyone to secure their own funds and transact with whomever they want, whenever they want.

If you don't have a bank account and earn a paycheck, you have to use payday lenders or exchanges to turn it into cash (after paying a substantial fee) or a secured credit card.

If you use the card, you can only transact with those who can accept cards.  If you are in a country where cards aren't used, you have to use cash.

If you convert your check into cash, or can only get paid in cash, you have other problems:  Now you have to somehow keep it secure (under a mattress? on your person?).  These are subject to theft.

Using strictly cash also means that transactions can only be done in-person.

With Bitcoin Cash, the fees are negligible (even for people earning just $2 each day).  The coins are secure.  You can transact with anyone, anywhere on the globe, any time.

This is a very powerful economic force that can improve lives (and health)  for many people.

"The thing is, this isnt even really crypto. I see VEN  being more about blockchain solutions, literally as they call their product a BaaS. Crypto as currenices, in the form of BTC, and other later projects that focus on being currencies, like Nano and so on, they are exactly that, a crypto currency. And my personal opinion is, actual true adoption at the level that fiat has, might never really come. There are too many obstacles, and the simple fact that the prices fluctuate so much deny these currenices being used as an actual currency. You dont want your paycheck to lose 30percent of its value the day after you received it.  But this is not about being a currency, this is about providing a blockchain service to successful enterprises, and showing them that it has its benefits and that they want to be a part of it. They arent selling a crypto, they are selling a service. Huge difference, and the most important reason why this will take off much sooner - I mean years, maybe even decades - sooner than crypto currencies. There is still the possibility that crypto currencies will sit in the sidelines for years, and ultimately not getting anywhere. BaaS on the other hand... this is real, this is now, this is THE project that you should want to be invested in. ",1523631871
Your making an assumption. I never said I don't plan on owning any crypto. I said I don't plan on ever holding ETH or BTC. Which is perfectly fine. ,1523631855
"&gt;I want to know what the exact criteria is to increase the block size. They also never say how decentralized bitcoin should be. If either of those statements are false please let me know.

There is no *exact criteria*. And one of the reasons for this is that it opens up a can of worms, where every Tom, Dick and Harry would start to argue about how these criteria are shit, wrong, blah, blah, blah. The criteria, however, do exist. Roughly speaking, when most of the Bitcoin on-chain traffic employs the available efficiency improvements. Say SegWit... we are now at ~35%. If that was ~90%, you could say we'd be ready for a block size increase. (If it was the ONLY improvement.) A similar story with txs batching, which saves SO MUCH space on the blockchain it's untrue. And Schnorr once it's deployed. And once we have millions of LN nodes open... it's now ~1,800, after a month of beta launch. And this is just what we know for now. There is a lot of room to grow.

As for decentralization, I'll give you one (personal) criterion: Syncing up a full node on modern hardware in an average urban area (of the first world) should not take more than 1day. Even 1 day is too much time to wait for most people, but let's be OK with enthusiasts only running nodes. (On my RasPi3 it took me ~1month to sync up last summer. But that's a RasPi3.) On modern hardware, if it takes more than 1 day, we are significantly curbing the distribution of full nodes.

&gt;I suppose this is the very core of the issue. Who decides when enough efficiencies have been implemented to raise the block size? I mean, we're going to need bigger blocks anyway so why not a bit now to not lose to altcoins (well tbh, now that there's BCH, I hope BTC doesn't increase the block size until every single small blocker agrees to :p)

I mentioned above some fairly objective criteria - a very high proportion of txs are using optimization techniques. That can be reviewed objectively on the blockchain. At that point, there won't be any efficiency to squeeze out anymore, and the only way forward will be block size increase.

&gt;I believe we should be fostering adoption while adding those efficiencies.

Disagree. Why? Again, s-curve adoption. Once adoption explodes, there won't be much time to optimize.

&gt;Who decides when ""we're all on-board""?

See above.

&gt;That's the point of the block reward. It's a subsidy to get the network and ecosystem bootstrapped. Companies get to use the blockchain for cheap to provide additional value to the network/infrastructure.

You misunderstand the socialization of cost. Companies that move money need to pay for txs fees. If these costs are not directly passed onto customers, they are absorbed by companies. Now, if you increase the block size, these costs disappear. With small blocks and optimizations, on the other hand, companies need to spend dev $$$ to take advantage of the lower costs. Basically, big blocks externalize the cost of dev time, which small blocks force onto the company. (No free lunch... so someone must cover those costs.) That's why I'm saying ""socialization of cost, but privatization of profit"". Companies certainly don't share their profits with node operators!

&gt; It's good enough.

It's not... you cannot have 10,000 txs/s ready anytime soon. Not good enough.

&gt;It will be less work to copy those improvements to BCH than to move all the BCH users to BTC.

Funny, you just admitted to wanting to leech off Core's work... but then r-btc is very keen on bashing everything Core does!

in any event, my post on Proof of HUMAN Work, linked elsewhere, should put this in perspective. Yes, everything can be copied, but you'll need to find bodies to do it. People dedicating their time to do it. And don't say ""someone will do it!""... that's wishful thinking, not a serious plan. Trust me, if you make these kinds of comments at work, to your boss or even higher up, you'll never get promoted. You need to tell people exactly HOW are you gonna address a problem,. And that's difficult. Alas, most of the narrative around big blocks I can hear is always ""TECH will improve! Stuff will get done! We're on-board!"", but no one is actually putting forward any specific proposals. 

I'm happy to discuss the merits of any proposal, but it must be a very specific one, not a hand waving one that relies on wishful thinking and goodwill.

I bought my first BTC in May 2015 as I read about the technology and really wanted to just try it out. Spent some back in the good old days. Stayed for the devolution of 2nd layer solutions on BTC and glorious evolution of Bitcoin Cash.

Through general interest in the tech, I started buying some other coins, trying to stay based on tech but certainly threw a little around on random shit.  I also went in ICO for TenX just to try an ETH smart contract and the idea was a great one. That was exciting for me. Now TenX is all but dead, buying time with announcement after announcement. The card worked great when I had it, but the creator is anti-BCH as well which is a true shame. Luckily they added ETH just before it died, but any post to do with BCH at TenX gets brigaded hardcore and Julian seems firmly in the original camp.

"&gt; When you do this, you can't expect to have a rational conversation with people. If Bitcoin Cash was to run on its own merit nobody would have a problem with it. With this, you will bring out the worst in people.

Bitcoin is owned by no one. You're going to have to get over that. I can call it whatever I like. Of course, you're able to call it whatever you like. Keep in mind that for me, it looks like the Core devs derailed bitcoin. I am not trying to scam people, I truly believe it is bitcoin.

&gt;  ""Once a month you need to top your Starbucks account up"". And that it works ""Like a Starbucks gift card"". That's it. And everyone understands that.

Except they won't use it because topping up requires and on chain TX and it won't be worth the cost. How much are fees supposed to be again? What is a good fee cost it should be? That will be determined by the block limit. 

&gt; And if you cannot when it hits the fan, your project is dead in the water.

This is what I don't get. It was hitting the fan when fees were rising. The difference is, we have a different view. You think high fees are okay, I don't. 

&gt; In short, just holding your keys does not prevent miners from, collectively, increasing the block reward.

You running your own node does nothing for the collective of the network. If there is a hard fork you disagree with and everyone else forks off, you are left with essentially an altcoin. But if miners attack it, there be a fork. You will hold coins from both chains. If miners want to attack it that way, users can fork their own coin. But to me, that's a strawman because I don't think they will want to increase the limit. It's in their interest not to. If they do, it will kill the coin. Their version of it anyway.

&gt; This is the same mentality, exactly the same, that led us to the 2008 crisis. Yeah, just let financial markets self regulate, it's in their interest to not fuck up.

2008 crisis *is* the market regulating its self. What you are trying to suggest is a centrally controlled coin where ""experts"" decide to do what they think is best. *That's* what got us the crisis. 

&gt; The small block crowd has embraced the cautious approach.

Bitcoin's biggest asset: [Proof of HUMAN work](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8bqj48/the_real_power_of_bitcoin_proof_of_human_work). 

Bitcoin Cash, and all the other coins out there, have this as biggest disadvantage compared to Bitcoin. If you don't energize people to start building shit in the BCH ecosystem, you just won't be able to compete. And you are at a significant disadvantage right now. Ignore at your own peril.

&gt; force people to use AML/KYC hubs

What if I use hubs outside of the US? Do you think Venezuelan hubs will comply with US laws? Or Syrian hubs? Iranian? North Korean? They will ignore all that just to spite the US!

(And of course, all of this is assuming LN nodes will be forced to adopt AML/KYC, which is far from guaranteed. And many people are mounting legal challenges to the very idea, based on the fact you never have control of people's money. That is, AML/KYC only if you have discretionary control over people's money, which with LN you don't.) 

The AML/KYC story for LN hubs is a broken one.

&gt;LN turn into the equivalent of PoS running on top of PoW chain that isn't secured enough because LN is sucking up fee value that should be going to miners.

No, no, no. First, LN is not PoS because LN is not trying to achieve consensus. With LN there is no global consensus! That is, if me and you open a channel, nobody will even know how much do I have and how much do you have... the definition of no consensus. 

As for sucking fees... think I recently saw some dude's twitter post where he claimed to have collected 1sat for 10, or even 100txs! I think that is kind of enough to settle the question about LN fees. (Remember, high competition drives costs down.)

&gt;I guess I rather go bold than be too cautious.

Sure. And I think that's where the fundamental difference lies. And, I'm afraid, it's an irreconcilable one. I told you about banks being left to their own devices prior to 2008. In this case, IF big blocks are no good enough, we fucked up, and I'm not sure we get another chance.

Also, this approach is like playing the Russian roulette - Some things are just not worth gambling over.

&gt;Yes, they are a business, not accountants.

Accountants are businesses...

&gt;No, because banks have regulations protecting them, preventing more efficient businesses from taking their place. Miners will always have competition so they will be forced to keep fees low. If they try to hold out for high fees, other miners will mine the transactions that are profitable. The fees will be determined by a free market, not a centrally controlled arbitrary limit.

This is a naive view. You can already see how ""the blockchain industry"" is starting to form ""self regulatory"" bodies. It's happening in the UK and in Japan. Prob in the US as well. (Again, Google it.) It's only a matter of time before miners start forming ""self regulatory"" bodies, or ""industrial alliances"". Especially if they keep on being giant mining operations. And then it becomes extremely easy for governments to start regulating them, and imposing whatever they will. 

This is on the assumption that only huge hubs can run a mining operation. The lucky thing here is that setting up a mining pool is not too difficult and if governments try to crack down on mining pools you'll see the same thing you see when trying to squash a spider egg... countless mini spiders running everywhere. 

Make no mistake. If the only way to mine is through giant hubs running server farms, that's the same as ""crypto banking"", and it WILL attract regulation and all that. Including AML/KYC.

"Ideally there would have been a halt to excessive debt-massaging inflation and if there was a need for digital currency it would be accounted for in some direct ratio, but that requires developers to work just as hard or harder (they have bosses in the form of governments and regulators in this scenario) for much less reward so likely wouldn't happen.

The idea probably wouldn't have taken off at all if people didn't have some ""Aha!"" moment where they realised that it definitely has a true utility/reason to exist, therefore more people will hopefully want it in the future, therefore fill the bags with as much as you can.  Profit is a much greater motivator for the vast majority of people than some idealistic common good.
Generally the price or cap of a token doesn't mean much in terms of the service rendered, tokens being used for a specific purpose still get pegged to USD at the moment of transaction - if there's liquidity and a low spread then it's the right price for the coin at any given time (this is working on the presumption that the token actually has utility - not too many of those around). There's probably no ""ideal"" price unless there's some functioning part of it's economy which gets hindered by a price drop (i.e. mining).

Price stability will come in time but it will still be more volatile than a dollar due to other currencies or opportunities arising, best to view your holdings as a type of index fund which you can rebalance or have managed for you and you get to cash out to a stablecoin if needs be in the future.

That probably sounds like heresy to a Bitcoin maximalist who thinks we'll be buying everything in sats but I'd be looking at the likelihoods of the value the entire crypto space may be able to offer vs that value being swallowed by one particular project and it's sidechains. Latter doesn't seem too likely to me, it requires devs to defer to Bitcoin's Core devs as an implicit authority figure over their own developments (the reason Ethereum exists).",1523630479

"Possibly, but also the trigger for this (and a lot of the runup) was from the big market order push that crushed shorts.

That being said, it was largely in response to an oversell artificial dump the preceded it.

So many people have been trying to figure out where the floor is for the last month or more. All that matters (literally the only thing) in a speculative market like this is what people think. The floor is where people think it is.

I think the large spike was just the adrenaline shot that the market needed to wake back up. There's 2B USD in tether that's waiting to jump back into the market, trying to time the floor. How much money is sitting in fiat in exchanges, just holding out, waiting, trying to get as much of that bottom as possible?

If we get another 10% today, we could potentially explode, as people decide that the floor was 2 days ago, and they need to get in now while they can.

The same thing happened when BTC was $10. the same thing happened on the $1000 to $500 dump. People tried to wait until BTC went to $400. It went to $1000. They waited until it returns to $500, it went to $2000. The wanted to wait for the correction back to $1000, it went to $4000. 

Sometimes the floor is the floor and you either get on it, or you watch everyone adopt the thing that you believe in, but were too greedy, trying to squeeze 10-20% more, and miss out on 800% rise, praying for a correction that never comes.

Don't be that guy.

Are you serious? Why would anyone manipulate bitcoin if they didn't make any money doing it? That's completely absurd. 

&gt;They're breaking though the buy/sell walls at a loss in an attempt to influence trader psychology

This is also absurd. Psychology is fickle. Basing a manipulation scheme on psychology would quickly render the manipulator broke, as you have correctly pointed out.  

since ""manipulation"" still exists, it means people are not going broke doing it, which means your entire thesis falls apart. 

&gt;""The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.""

The stock market is entirely based on entities creating cash flow. Bitcoin does not create cash flow. That doesn't mean that bitcoin has no value, but it does mean that you can't value bitcoin the way you value a stock. 

&gt;Bitcoin is gradually getting less volatile because the manipulators keep running out of money.

Bitcoin is getting less volatile because more players are entering and exiting the space at a more consistent pace. If manipulators were running out of money, they wouldn't be manipulating. Incentives matter. Economics 101. 

Since I've been so negative, I'll give you an example of a manipulation scheme that would actually make money, given that you had enough capital to execute it (hint: it has nothing to do with psychology. Nobody with enough money to manipulate the market is stupid enough to rely on something so fickle)

Let's say you're a massive hedge fund that has accumulated 100k bitcoins around December, at 20k a piece. Then that fund gets a new manager. A typical manager getting hired at a fund will not be held responsible for any moves made in the first 3 months. This is so he can liquidate the old managers positions, if he doesn't care for the company, without it affecting his track record. 

Let's say this guy hates bitcoin, and wants to get 100k coins off his books, but doesn't want to destroy his capital in the process. In theory, said fund manager could go short futures contracts 4 months from now. Over 3 months, he could liquidate the bitcoin portfolio, dropping the price of bitcoin down substantially by selling smallish chunks over time. 

By doing this, he is able to get all 100k bitcoins off his books, while hedging his losses. Because the futures contracts are cash settled, he makes 20k - 7k x100 per contract, and gets all of his bitcoins off the books.

His overall trade is arbitrage, and represents a net-zero gain. Any market forces besides his own that move the price don't affect him, because he is hedged.  

This IS NOT manipulation in any way. In fact, plays like this happen all of the time. However, the artifacts of his trades would have you, and people like you, claiming manipulation.

"You got no idea about the goal of bitcoin. If you had, you would understand.",1523629303
"So first, the definition of arbitary:

&gt; Based on random choice or personal whim, rather than any reason or system.

That said, while sentiment is very bullish basically every time BTC has made a run like this - admittedly not this *sharp* - in recent months it has subsequently dived lower in the days and weeks after.

9K though would signal that the market has the energy to pull itself up past one orgasm of pent up buying energy. ",1523629292

"&gt; bitcoin (BCH)

When you do this, you can't expect to have a rational conversation with people. If Bitcoin Cash was to run on its own merit nobody would have a problem with it. With this, you will bring out the worst in people.

&gt;That demand is kept in check by the cost to run a mining operation.

This is relying on miners setting their own fees... I already remarked on how this is the same as banking. Elaborting on it elsewhere.

&gt;I have to disagree and I think you are extremely optimistic on the rate of adoption. Crypto adoption is slow and introducing another 'hop' of LN will slow BTC adoption even more. Of course I could be wrong and mania speculation could make BTC the reserve and LN as payments. I'm trying to see it but I don't. Crypto adoption (and speculation) happens in waves and it won't be like 'oh LN is available everyone adopt!'

You're right, it won't happen because LN is available. But there won't be any hops to jump through - All the complexities will (are, actually!) hidden by the GUI. You send Bitcoin to someone else, period. You don't need to know if this is via LN or on-chain, all of this is hidden. Look at Eclair, that's exactly what it does. The only thing people will need to understand is that ""Once a month you need to top your Starbucks account up"". And that it works ""Like a Starbucks gift card"". That's it. And everyone understands that.

But sure, it will take some time. The one thing I would like addressed by big-blockers, though, is the S-curve adoption. The prevailing attitude is ""We won't need 1GB blocks for ages!!"", but that's more false than true. The way things go is today you need, say, 4MB blocks. In a month you need 1GB blocks. That's how real life adoption works. Scale is not on a spectrum - You either can scale to millions of txs/s or you cannot. And if you cannot when it hits the fan, your project is dead in the water.

&gt;Non mining nodes provide no benefit to the network. You are your own bank by holding your private keys. 

This is another myth of r-btc. I suggest you do some independent research on the subject. In short, just holding your keys does not prevent miners from, collectively, increasing the block reward. (Keep in mind, increasing the block reward favours miners exclusively, so they all have the incentive to do it.) Running a full node does.

&gt;I will keep working towards 'money for everyone' until it is proven it can't work.

This is the same mentality, **exactly the same**, that led us to the 2008 crisis. Yeah, just let financial markets self regulate, it's in their interest to not fuck up. This, in essence, was the story people like Greenspan (chairman of the FED!) were telling about regulation. Google it. And then we fucked up royally, and now there's pundits going around saying ""Lessons have been learned"". Well, if we listened to the ""Doom&amp;Gloom mongers"" we would have avoided 2008. You, and others that think like you today, are committing the exact same logical fallacy: 

""*Let's keep going until it breaks down. But I don't believe it will break down because [reasons]*""

where [reasons] is anything from miners are incentivised to be honest and not break the system because it benefits them, to tech improvements and what not. And despite 2008 happend, it seems to be just impossible to convince you to adopt the cautious approach. The small block crowd has embraced the cautious approach.

"No, you entered into your position using ETH, so you're right you shouldn't be using BTC as your base trading pair you should be using ETH. The number one factor that affects USD value of any coin in this market is the performance of bitcoin and to a lesser extent ETH. Therefore, knowing whether your coin is going up or down in USD value is useless information unless you compare it to the performance of your base trading pair i.e. value in ETH.

To evaluate your coins performance properly you need to eliminate the swings of the market as a whole, which you do by ignoring USD value and instead comparing to your base trading pair. Otherwise you'll make stupid decisions like selling a 30% increase in USD value of your chosen coin when ETH went up by 35%, meaning you've actually lost coins overall since you bought in and would have been better off sticking with ETH the whole time.

Valuing your portfolio in terms of your base trading pair is the objectively correct way to do it if you have any plans to try and trade to increase your holdings. If you are literally not going to do anything but hold long term then fair enough just look at USD.

"Hi, with the “every trade being a taxable event” rule, wondering if “exchanging” my alt coins while they are down will help reflect a more accurate status for taxing. 
Purely made up numbers - Ex: bought bitcoin @ 1000 - sold at 10000 for alts. Alts tank. 
Alt1 (5k) now worth 500
Alt2 (5k) now worth 500
Taxable status shows 9k profits (sale of BTC only)

My proposition - realize loss with no change in position: 
Sell 500 of Alt1 for 500 of Alt2, and vice versa. Taxable status now shows break even (you have realized the losses), and you are in the exact same positions as showing 9k profits before. 

Is this feasible?",1523628483

I had bought BTC in spring 2017 with the intention of getting some things for our new home as value went up. Was going to need to sell 2 BTC to pay for these items, but coinbase locked me out.

So I got credit card debt that took 1 month to resolve. During that time BTC hit 14k when I finally sold. The credit card interest was nothing compared to the gains. **Thank you coinbase** :P

"History tells us to be very wary of economic 'experts' who believe they have a greater grasp on predicting the future of a given technology than those *actual* experts (i.e. scientists) who actually understand how the technology is evolving:

&gt;“The growth of the Internet will slow drastically, as the flaw in ""Metcalfe's law""--which states that the number of potential connections in a network is proportional to the square of the number of participants--becomes apparent: most people have nothing to say to each other! ... By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet's impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine's... As the rate of technological change in computing slows, the number of jobs for IT specialists will decelerate, then actually turn down” — Paul Krugman, 1998

Krugman's error was not recognising that the internet was merely the backbone (or, protocol) for the emergence of *multiple* parallel networks of communication and idea sharing platforms that would be built on top of this protocol.  Therefore, Metcalfe's law does not apply, since we are not talking about linear scaling and usage of a single product or service (like a fax machine).  

Similarly with bitcoin...  The technology is not evolving in a vacuum; beyond obvious metrics such as wallet signups / volume / search trends, we cannot clearly see where all this goes once sidechains and the multiple trust networks being built atop the bitcoin blockchain begin to evolve in parallel.  

TL;DR: Time and user adoption of real world services built on top of the protocol will tell where all this goes... (not 'experts' in matters of economics attempting to divine the future).",1523626256

A set of values that engender one with a duty to behave with virtue and responsibility beyond kith and kin. 

To me, crypto has the power to side step and potentially disrupt the financial systems and their toxic self serving ties to government. It has no regard for ones national identity, race, religious, political beliefs or social class. There is no middle man to conveniently take a cut depending on any of the above, be they banks or government. We just have to ensure it stays this way.

"This is what I think you will see in BTC

~$15k to $30k Thanksgiving spike, 2018

~$30k to $80k Thanksgiving Bull Run, 2019

~$50k to $250k Halving Bull Run, 2020

Some days I say $80k, other days I feel $250k, but...

2021 I suspect will actually be a very ""trying"" year. There are numerous things which I think will occur in 2021, which may harm Bitcoin, namely an 'overly optimistic' bull run - And other factors.

Crypto will ultra explode 2021, but say BTC gets to $100k in 2020. That's $1 Trillion per year spent on Hash Security, or $2.5 Billion daily needing to be funneled into Bitcoin to simply maintain, let alone grow.

This also means that minimum Satoshi cost for sending a BTC transaction over network (we will be pure 2nd layer by this point, obviously), would be $0.001 or $0.23 at 1 Sat / Byte, 225 Byte. If you speculate 10 Sat as 'standard', than $2.30 per BTC direct transfers, effectively preventing $5 transactions from using BTC direct.

But what is more relevant, is you presume mining continue along the path of specializing (which it will), and monopolistic tendencies (which it most likely will), then you have real issue. For example, say Jihan achieves 5% Excess Profit vs Public Common, say 50%.

Say this is 625,000,000 Sat / Block, or 1,389 Sat / Byte processed.

Thus Jihan could pay, at cost same as Public Common, 1,389 Sat / Byte for every single Bitcoin transaction, flooding the network - or $312.50 per transaction, at 225 Byte. Presuming 50% Hash ownership, and that block remain over 50% full, then this is effectively at no cost to him (and artificially drives up the sale of mining equipment to public, causing them to over pay, in which he can 'short' them afterwards, and re-purchase equipment at close out values, like today).

Even if BTC is to cost $300 / Transfer during a transaction spam attack, presuming 2nd Layer, this is largely inconsequential as it is divided between 1,000 Real Life Transactions or $0.30 Each. But the quantity of Bitcoin required to execute this is actually quite little. If you say you most flood 50% of Network, then 150,000 BTC can flood an entire year, or anyone with $1 Bil BTC today.

And then you have the EOS attack vector. ""Alt Coin"" raising funding via your platform, in your value, promising to replace your platform and destroy it simultaneously. As the 'concentrations' of BTC are not well distributed, this person could be a disgruntled Ver, a Winklevoss, or a series of brats who just like fucking people and happen upon 150,000 BTC. Example, Draper has 300,000 BTC, as noted.

I don't know a great solution to solve, but I suspect Transaction Fee Reward should be Burned, or some % burned, ultimately. Even in a 100% Monopolistic mining scenario, double spend is of less value as opposed to Transaction Fee spam, which would be costly, perpetual, and insanely destructive.

Waiting until the price has already escalated, 2nd layer ingrained, and so on, effectively makes hard forking impossible, unreasonable, and the 'high worth terrorist' has equal ownership of new chain, so on. He would have millions to pay in social media shills, drowning opposition.

I do not think Technology works in such a way the public can prevent concentration. Public is too sheepish, honestly, and Ideas come upon single individuals, or small groups. BTC was founded by the work of 1 (or a few) man, not the 'open source' of millions of people attempting to destroy the Fed, etc.

I think the only solution would be (in the end) to Burn some % of transaction fee, to prevent it from becoming cost-less to the monopolist. There could be other ideas, but this concept was tested last Christmas, and will be tested again this Christmas, and will be executed in full force 2020.

In 2021, the public will be required to accept, or adjust. In this moment of chaos, the flood of noobs will be so insane, the anger so vehement, the Craig Wrights &amp; Ver's so numerous, 'overwhelming social consensus' could be a challenge. As people say, social discussion is best in times of downturns, most everyone agrees with this. Up cycles create too much noobery, and maximalist justification, etc, to produce critical though.

But that's just my opinion. Take it with a grain of salt. I've been wrong many, a many times before.",1523625140

"Adding a trading pair to an exchange is not much more than adding a few database records - e.g. to enable the user to have a balance that can be traded. Then adding deposit/withdraw ability depends on the coin; but generally speaking, it just requires a daemon setup (maybe a few for redundancy) and for that daemon to talk to the exchange software using RPC calls (which are generally identical for all coins based on bitcoin and the same for ethereum-based coins or ERC20 tokens).

ERC20 tokens are the easiest to add, as you already have the daemon set up for it.

I'd estimate at an absolute maximum, you're looking at 6-8 hours work to do all of this stuff and maybe a slightly increased operating cost due to extra load on your server(s), however I'd say that's probably covered by the exchange fee on every trade.

I can't say exactly for the bigger exchanges what is required, but if their code is anything like the open sourced exchange codebases I've looked into, it can't be anything much more difficult.",1523624969

It seems that the intention of why you use Bitcoin is what counts. Nevertheless, you're required to keep track of all transactions you do.

In reality, nobody knows shit, even inside the ATO. Unless you're transacting a huge amount of money, you should be fine. However, they'll probably judge your intention. If there's evidence your intention is to use it as an investment, then you'll pay CGT.

I'm not sure how it would look like on the wild. Has anybody here that lives in Australia been charged by the ATO for somehow not paying Tax correctly? If so, how was the experience?",1523624450

Maybe you think BTC's tech is outdated and doesn't have a future in the cyrpto space.

"Hey man I'm in the same position, waiting for a consolidation. This could be the start of the bull run or it could not, we both made a mistake and based on the 2014 crypto crash layover (which looks name near identical), we still have some room to grow before we crash again. I would wait it out, there's no way it rises to 10k without a crash, that's basically gauranteed. Good luck.",1523623829
"Someone asked a question and I typed a long and thoughtful response out, only to find out they deleted it! No! so here it is anyway..  
I would hold a chunk in Eth and BTC as they aren't going anywhere any time soon.  

I'm invested in Cardano. It's aiming to knock Eth off its throne by being designed ground-up to beat it in terms of transactions, smart contract platform, security and usability. Lots of great updates coming. No product as of right now.  

Tron, multimedia token. Think purchasing and tipping. Potentially a way to consume multimedia on a worldwide marketplace. No fucking dumb currency barriers like region locking of content. Testnet has just been launched with good success and mainnet is coming end of May. Lot and a lot and a lot of FUD surrounding this, some of it true, some just salty bag-holders or missing out. I was ready to cash out if it ever hit 9-10c but the testnet turned my sentiment around. It actually works and works really well.  


FunFair is another I have a bunch of. This has made some partnerships and use cases already. It's a Casino coin designed to make online-gambling provably fair for both the company and the user. This is something that Blockchain is actually really useful for as it can verify the legitmacy of payments and odds to ensure nobody is screwing anyone over - the Gambling industry loses billions of dollars per year due to fraud so this is something vendors will look into picking up.  

Ughh.. What else do I have.. Ripple. I'm kinda halfway on this, I only have 100 or so coins. People have moved hundreds of billions of dollars worldwide in one transaction and it only cost them a tiny fraction of a cent. Really clever stuff, banks are adopting the underlying technology but people confuse this with banks using XRP, which they aren't. Regardless, I really can't see this coin going to 0.  

I also have EthLend. Not much again, but some. It's a nice project - decentralized lending, think AirBNB lending + blockchain. But people are realising the coin doesn't have much utility and it's up to the creators to make the coin have some usability. At the moment people borrow USD by putting Ethereum up as collateral and then pay back with an interest rate they set. Lenders find an interest rate they're willing to loan to and send Eth... So where does the LEND coin come in? Don't know.   


People will tell you coins are good and coins are bad. Just find out which coins have good volume and which have projects which can lead somewhere and invest. Try and ignore all the shilling and fudding.  

I hope I have explained my portfolio without looking like I'm shilling my coins. I'm confident about 3 of them, almost sure on one and iffy on the other. Like everyone else, I've made good and bad investments (Cardano before it shot up) (Ripple AFTER it shot up) and don't underestimate the benefit of hindsight - there's **always** a better way you could have done something. Don't sweat it and just enjoy the ride.",1523623819

"&gt; Proof it.

Segwit if you want something more specific.

&gt; What? This sentence makes no sense.

I'll try try to be more verbose.

If you claim that bitcoin is only bitcoin if the changes made to it are made or approved by Satoshi that means that bitcoin is Satoshis vision. Satoshis vision was for bitcoin to become a peer-to-peer electronic cash system without middleman which is a vision that is rejected by BTC. Satoshis vision was for the block size to increase which it seems is also rejected by BTC. Since BTC goes against the vision of Satoshi we can only conclude that BTC is not bitcoin.",1523621779
"Of course, Im up to BTC and also EOS and CS coins!",1523621735
"- The 0-conf on BTC is unusable in many circumstances including when the block is full as we saw in the early of this year. So when you order your pizza, if you channel missing $2, you may be stuck to wait for 6 confirmations, when the mempool is jammed, it totally unusable!
- The locked money is a huge problem. If you have a single channel open, the model will be extremely centralized, if you have many channel open, you need to lock many times the money. Considering how people are broke in general, I don't think this is economically feasible to have 5-6 channels per users with a relative amount of money so they can be used in both direction.

"I'm 100% the complete opposite. I did what you did last pump, missed 30% of the ground floor. It felt AWFUL.

This time, I held the whole time down and simply moved stuff around to more stable coins - not tether but out of alts into BTC, etc. I caught some good pumps by being in good coins (a nano pump, a BNB pump) which helped me stabilize on the way down. 

Most importantly, I let buys build up for a week (and longer in the last month), and timed buys on big non-organic dumps. 

I made a great buy 2 days ago and nearly caught the knife buying in with about 20% of my total stack.

I'm already back in the green, and had ground floor position. I didn't sell a coin, so I never at any point realized any losses. I'm also part of the ground floor IF this keeps going up sustained, and never returns this low ever again.

Similar to when BTC fell from 1k to $500, there were people who were waiting for it to go back down to $500 to buy back in when they missed the floor. Many gave up waiting at $2k, $3k, $4k and had to buy back in, and lost out in 800% gains, just because they were trying to squeeze out another 30-40% of a ground floor position.

Don't be that guy. I know I won't.

I have a piece of the ground floor now (a large piece). My earlier buys were never realized losses and should all look great in 5 years anyways. It's ZERO stress way to invest. 

If it goes back down, it just means I can get bigger pieces of the ground floor. 

If it goes up, I get everything pumped. 

IMO, it's win win either way for me. But that's because my timeframe is 5 years, not 1 month.

NOTHING I bought this year is going to look bad in 5 years, not even Feb dollar cost-average purchases. They are already ""diluted"" due to the last 3-4 weeks worth of $5 Nano, $45 Neo, $400 Eth, $6000 BTC, etc. 

But waiting for a ground floor that never comes, and watching everyone get rich because I wanted to skim another 20%? No thank you.

To learn more bout Milton Friedman, consider perusing [this great collection](http://www.openculture.com/2014/01/milton-friedman-john-kenneth-galbraith-tv-shows.html) on open culture's website.

I'm curious if he was predicting the future, or was privy to ideas that had simply not been fully realized yet. I mean, someone in his position was likely pretty well connected into the space of economics, the unintuitive effects of money, and the nature of greed as a positive force.

He was a very interesting person. If you squint a bit, the math behind his proposal of [a negative income tax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtpgkX588nM) looks a heck of a lot like a basic income.

In the end this technology used as advertised would end up buckle and dining fees out if the user or even encourage buying more than you wanted to try and chip away at the fees. One day if reloading/splicing is made available it might be viable, but I would imagine LN splicing would add another on chain fee. It was already determined that 100's of Starbucks mocha's would have to be purchased to break even on one open/close and individual purchase routing fees, and that test was done with the open and close fees at the lowest fees on btc since sometime in 2016",1523618906

To learn more bout Milton Friedman, consider perusing this great collection on open culture's website: http://www.openculture.com/2014/01/milton-friedman-john-kenneth-galbraith-tv-shows.html

I'm curious if he was predicting the future, or was privy to ideas that had simply not been fully realized yet. I mean, someone in his position was likely pretty well connected int the space of economics, the unintuitive effects of money, and the nature of greed as a positive force.

He was a very interesting person. If you squint a bit, the math behind his proposal of [a negative income tax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtpgkX588nM) looks a heck of a lot like a basic income. ",1523618679

"**Texas divisionism**

Texas divisionism is a mainly historical movement that advocates the division of the U.S. state of Texas into as many as five states, as statutorily permitted by a provision included in the resolution admitting the former Republic of Texas into the Union in 1845.

Texas divisionists argue that the division of their state could be desirable because, as the second-largest and second most-populous state in the U.S., Texas is too large to be governed efficiently as one political unit, or that in several states Texans would gain more power at the federal level, particularly in the U.S. Senate to which each state elects two Senators and by extension in the Electoral College in which each state gets two electoral votes for their Senators in addition to an electoral vote for each Representative. However, division may be wastefully duplicative, requiring a new state government.

Texas' division was frequently proposed in the early decades of Texan statehood, particularly in the decades immediately prior to and following the American Civil War in which Texas seceded from the Union and joined the Confederacy.

Event segwit was sold in a package that would have increased the block size at some future date. So it is obvious that it was never considered that changing the size limit would somehow make it no longer bitcoin. Block size has nothing to do with what we call bitcoin.

"Scenario: I am shorting, pizza == bitcoin

Lets say a pizza is worth $10.  
I think pizza will be worth $6 tomorrow. I short a pizza, which means I borrow a pizza from the pizza shop, and sell it back to them straight away - I now have $10.This comes with an agreement to buy that borrowed pizza back tomorrow, for whatever price it is then.  
The result - if I am correct in my theory that pizza will lose 40% of its value, then I make a profit of $4, which is the difference between when I sold the borrowed pizza, and then buying the pizza back.
The risk - if the pizza becomes more expensive tomorrow, then I must stick to the agreement and buy it back - after all the pizza shop wants the pizza back!. Say the cost is now $17 - which means I lose $7 as I am forced to buy it for more than I sold it.

Where things get crazy, is with leverage. Say I use $10 to get a levarage at 5x, and borrow 4 more pizzas in addition to the one I got myself. If once again the price drops to $6/pizza then I make a profit of 5 pizzas times $4 price decrease - so from my $10 I have made an extra $20.

Now lets say I am wrong..and the market value of pizza goes up. I now need to buy back 5 pizzas at a loss. If, like previously, the pizzas value becomes $17, then I have a loss of $35 (7$ loss per each of 5 pizzas) from my starting amount of $10. Well...I only had $10 to begin with, and theres no way I can afford to buy them back at a loss higher than what I started with. So, the pizza shop liquidates me to make sure they dont lose anything. In this case, as soon as the market value of pizza becomes $12, I am forced to buy it back at a loss of $2 a pizza. Result - I lose all $10..any more and theres no way that Ill be able to pay back my loss.",1523617088

"&gt; Perhaps the top priority for the Bitcoin Cash community should be to find a replacement for reddit. It doesn't have to be fully peer to peer or decentralised, but a forum which had a different approach to community moderation might be a help.

A system called Politeia is being built to replace Reddit.

Communication software suitable for serious open governance process must satisfy requirements I covered in detail [here](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/ZcashFoundation/issues/58#issuecomment-368159053), but briefly: protect integrity and authenticity of messages, resist (silent) censorship and prevent spam.

In short, Politeia is Git anchored to blockchain, hence expensive to rewrite, easy to replicate and verify. Moderation has provable censorship. For every post you get a ""censorship token"" that you can use to publicly prove you've been censored. Additional spam protection is done by requiring tiny payment to create account and post.

The design is not fully decentralized, only the critical bits. I find it quite pragmatic, it allows to get something working with minimum P2P challenges and is ""good enough"" to bootstrap governance process that is still a huge improvement over vanilla Reddit. End goal is to decentralize control of project fund and disburse according to holder vote.

Relevant for Bitcoin Cash is that it is coin-agnostic (Decred stuff is plugin). Further, parts can be reused to allow broader application of the concept of versioned and timestamped data.

Current state: storage and anchoring done, paywall in testing, coin voting in development. [Test version](https://test-proposals.decred.org/) is running with CLI and Reddit-looking GUI.

Correct me if I am wrong here:

I know people shorting BTC are basically betting that BTC is going down in value on a specific date, and they can use margin which is like a leverage effect? So if they are betting 10$ with a 10x leverage they will lose/gain 100$ depending on the price of BTC.

Who are they betting against though? The exchanges? Us? Does that kind of trading have any impact on the market as a whole? If I am invested in BTC and hoping for prizes to rise, should I be happy that people who shorted BTRC got rekt?

"&gt; What does bitconnect has to do with ANYTHING we are discussing here?

Ironic that you miss a pretty obvious joke right before calling me autistic. The point is that the quoting the official docs has no weight when they aren't trustworthy. 

The term hard fork has a meaning. It's a chain split due to disagreement on the rules of the chain between different nodes and miners. Meaning that *one* chain gets split into two. It's called a fork because it's like a fork in the road. One path is split into two. 

In this case, it was ZCL that was split into ZCL and BTCP, just like BTC got split into BTC and BTH in august. 

**You can personally verify this statement using block explorers like I suggested in the comment above.** 

&gt; Meaning, you can claim your BTCP if you held BTC or ZCL in your wallet during the snapshot.

This has been said a thousand times by now - BTC users got an airdrop.

I can make a brand new coin that will allow BTC, LTC, BCH and ETH holders to claim coins that they have on the respective chains. That does not make it a QUAD-fork. It's a new coin with airdrops.

Being ignorant of the terminology and underlying mechanisms is not an excuse to make factually incorrect statements.

"Hey thanks for your input and passionate expression of your view. Honestly this is exactly what is needed more. Individual thought that has no issue breaking mould and conveying their mind.

I never did put it so simplistic though. I never said that is all what millennials do. I also agree that innovation, specially tech based and new social orientated DOES come primarily from the minds of mills. That is a much broader topic though and not really what I was touching on.

There are many things at play obviously but also do not think that anyone who refers to Elites in automatically on the path on Illuminati. It in itself is not a dirty title. Also, one must realize that if we are existing as a system of Societies within this Civilized manner of being Human. Then one must give acknowledgement to the fact that there is a spectrum of intelligence among that collective. So it is natural that the lesser able will be influenced by those who place themselves in places of power and dominance over the collective, within the system which we manage.

Again, though this is a MUCH greater topic, for another sub, clearly. You can't yourself deny that advertisement for crypto is borderline on the same standard as advertisement for kids cereals. Those minds are clearly not developed and seek shiny colorful stuff! That also, without subjectiveness, is a successful system of advertising. So it would then be feasible to conclude that in order to apply that same type of success across other products, and information delivery to the masses, the masses would first have to be moulded to accept it.

The California State Legislature is the state legislature of the U.S. state of California. It is a bicameral body consisting of the lower house, the California State Assembly, with 80 members, and the upper house, the California State Senate, with 40 members. New legislators convene each new two-year session, to organize, in the Assembly and Senate Chambers, respectively, at noon on the first Monday in December following the election. After the organizational meeting, both houses are in recess until the first Monday in January, except when the first Monday is January 1 or January 1 is a Sunday, in which case they meet the following Wednesday.

**Political party strength in California**

California is largely a Democratic stronghold and one of the ""big three"" Democratic states in presidential elections alongside New York and Illinois.

The following table indicates the party of elected officials in the U.S. state of California:

Governor

Lieutenant Governor

Attorney General

Secretary of State

Treasurer

Controller

Insurance Commissioner

California Superintendent of Public Instruction

The table also indicates the historical party composition in the:

Board of Equalization

Is crypto a threat to our monetary system?  YES ABSOLUTELY!  
  
The answer they provided is the misconception. If btc, or any other crypto for that matter, where to replace fiat, THE VALUE WOULDN'T FLUCTUATE. An apple at the store would remain the same price every day, and that price would be in btc. It only fluctuates this heavily because people keep changing back and forth between crypto and fiat and if you pay something in crypto, in most cases the price is calculated based on the current exchange rate to fiat. If crypto would replace fiat, the price for goods snd services would be a fixed price in crypto, thus the value would remain stable.",1523609571

"&gt; Why did you get into Bitcoin?

I am an avid internet user, and Being 30-something old I've witnessed the user experience hickups that comes with online payments. When introduced to bitcoin in 2011, I dismissed it as a futile attempt that would get banned by law sooner than I'd be able to learn the ins and outs of it. Needless to say, when I got re-introduced in 2013 I decided to learn those ins and outs.

As I learned how it works, I realized that it solves not only the problem of online payments in a cost-effective way, it also solved a great deal of monetary abuse by virtue of being transparent; as well as break down some current power structures by virtue of being inclusive.

No longer could a bank hide their dark sides, and no longer could those who do the good work of exposing corruption be economically silenced.

Well, that's why I **got in to bitcoin**, but that is not why I'm here today.

I'm here today because I took a very transforming journey as part of learning how things work, and most importantly, how they work **together**. I went from being a rather strong socialist (more like marxism, but not quite marxism) to a heavy believer in voluntaryism, realising along the way that I don't need **the establishment** in order to **cooperate** to build a future.

As such, you might view me as a little *""anti-establishment""*, but that would probably be a misstake, I am not against establishment in itself, only some implementations of it. For example, I don't mind the concept of a tutoring institution called school, but I utterly despise the mandatory regulation forcing it on those who are too young to make well-educated decisions. In fact, I don't think there needs to even be a difference between contemporary schooling and the ideal schooling for a given individual, some people learn very well in the current environments and benefit greatly from them. My concern is merely what happens **if** an individual decides a different path to knowledge is better suited to them.

I also don't believe that establishment is the root cause of corruption, but that corruption will find its way into any system, and would rather fight corruption itself than fight the establishment.

I do believe that people, given security, will be good to eachother. People without security will do what's necessary to ensure their survival in a scarce-resource environment.

Now Bitcoin has a role to play here, and that role for me is to negate the most powerful tools for corruption: censorship, secrecy and trust.

Without the ability to deny people financial inclusion, they can no longer demand cohesion - those that want to be different now has the means to interact with society at large without having to conform with society at large.

Wihout the ability to hide their intentions and results, they can no longer get away with damaging the community at their own gain, and the incentives to do good is once again balanced such that helping others will also help themselves.

Without the need for trust, those who corrupted the current power structures are no longer irreplacable, and new power structures that is not (yet) corrupt can take their place; and what those look like - we don't know yet.


All in all, I didn't get in to this for the money, I never asked for the money, and while it has been helpful to me privately, as long as I have security I shall sustain working on making the world better and my excess wealth will be shared.",1523609456

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_currency#History

In 1983, a research paper by David Chaum introduced the idea of digital cash.[4] In 1990, he founded DigiCash, an electronic cash company, in Amsterdam to commercialize the ideas in his research.[5] It filed for bankruptcy in 1998.[6][7] In 1999, Chaum left the company.

In 1997, Coca-Cola offered buying from vending machines using mobile payments.[8] After that PayPal emerged in 1998.[9] Other system such as e-gold followed suit, but faced issues because it was used by criminals and was raided by US Feds[who?] in 2005.[5] In 2008, bitcoin was introduced, which marked the start of Digital currencies.[5]

Origins of digital currencies date back to the 1990s Dot-com bubble. One of the first was E-gold, founded in 1996 and backed by gold. Another known digital currency service was Liberty Reserve, founded in 2006; it let users convert dollars or euros to Liberty Reserve Dollars or Euros, and exchange them freely with one another at a 1% fee. Both services were centralized, reputed to be used for money laundering, and inevitably shut down by the U.S. government.[10] Q coins or QQ coins, were used as a type of commodity-based digital currency on Tencent QQ's messaging platform and emerged in early 2005. Q coins were so effective in China that they were said to have had a destabilizing effect on the Chinese Yuan currency due to speculation.[11] Recent interest in cryptocurrencies has prompted renewed interest in digital currencies, with bitcoin, introduced in 2008, becoming the most widely used and accepted digital currency.",1523608911

"Let's assume you have one BTC and sell at 9k if the price drops to 8k you can buy back the one BTC and still have 1k profit or 1,125 BTC if you reinvest your profit. If you leverage your position instead, let's say 100x (don't do this) you sell 100 BTC for 900k and buy back 112,5 BTC at 8k. You pay back the 99 BTC you borrowed and have a profit of 12,5 BTC. However the exchange makes sure that you pay back the BTC, no matter what. If the price goes in the other direction and your account doesn't have the funds to cover the loss, youre position gets closed and your remaining dollar equivalent is used to buy back the borrowed BTC, leaving you with nothing",1523608565
"I guess my issue is: the limited supply of bitcoin should theoretically drive value over time because of basic principles like scarcity, supply &amp; demand, etc.  The fact that there is a limited supply of gold/diamonds/oil/iPhones/etc. drives he price. You compete with others at a price the market sets for an item, because you need that whole item. 

If a bitcoin is divisible, it isn’t scare. Most of the developed world will always be able to obtain *some* BTC. 

While I was writing this I also kind of realized that the limited supply still makes it consistently “difficult” or “competitive” to obtain any substantial amount, so I do see the value. ",1523608561

"We have a striking example here already: the existence of the BCH itself. It forked away from the Bitcoin because of the reasons we know.

The other chain, no matter of the user consensus, will be forced to remove all the patent technology that has been accumulated during the time. Something that could be impossible if tech and tech will accumulate year after year.

This is like giving the control of it in the hands of this or that other commercial company, that is exactly what is criticized to the Bitcoin and its devs.

"&gt; As a decentralized network

Just look at the topology of the current LN, there's no ""decentralized"" there; there's few huge centralized nodes that serve all other nodes. And that's when there's nothing you can buy with it, so the economic incentive to use centralized nodes is still not present. With this topology sure, everyone uses one channel connected to his favourite Bitcoin bank and only him will ever use said channel; even this approach, when extended to 7 billion people, still requires 20+ years of full blocks at 1Mb for everyone to open their single channel.

Of course with a decentralized network, instead, everyone's channel would always be in use, that's the objective that makes us call it ""decentralized"" and it's silly to say that individual channels will not be used much.

&gt; Lightning isn’t designed for larger transactions

Lightning is designed to force off-chain every transaction except the very huge multi-millionaire transactions. The whole security of the system is based on never ever having full blocks for more than a day, if people start to always making on-chain transactions for amounts as low as 1000$ that requirement won't be met and people will sooner or later have their LN funds stolen.",1523608313
"Most people around the world dont have bank accouts thus limitimg their financiql mobility and digital currencies could solve this problem.

"They are complacent, always getting snookered by the generational repetition of boom and bust as they try to justify why they ""deserve"" constantly rising house prices, ever increasing wages, more tat to fill the house with.

I think this ingrained entitlement and the economic incentive for getting into good cryptos is what will tip the balance eventually. For as long as the gains to be made outpace the gains of keeping funds in property, stocks or supposedly static in a bank account (losing purchasing power to inflation), there will be interest and adoption. The potential gains don't end until money supply is usurped. I'm not sure how past debts could be factored into this, that'll be a very complex mess!

The primary barrier besides genuine utility is that the UX for crypto is terrible. Every step you have to take to interact is a wall that has to be broken down and in order to break those walls the user has to understand what they're doing - there has to be a lot of work put into streamlining and removing barriers for the largest swathe of normies to enter. It has to become as easy to use (including on-ramp and private keys) as an app.",1523608137

"With Bitcoin its best to buy as needed for purchasing and if you want to invest, you need to invest a small, set amount on a regular basis and commit to never impulse buying. Its not good to impulse sell either but at least with that the worst case scenario is you lose out on an oppurtunity to make a lot of money.

I have automatic withdrawals set up so I invest about $100 a week into crypto and if I want to use BTC for a purchase, I do a one time exchange of just enough for the purchase and spend it immediatly.

The biggest mistake you can make is trying to play the market. Get the phrase ""is this a good time to buy"" out of your head because no matter what you will always be gambling. Small, regular investments over long periods of time is the strategy most likely to work. Sure, you might think about buying in big time and then later finding out you would have made a killing if you had done it, but for every situation like that there are 100 more where you buy in and end up selling at a loss because you panicked or invested more than you could afford.

A deathbed conversion is the adoption of a particular religious faith shortly before dying.

Claims of the deathbed conversion of famous or influential figures have also been used in history as rhetorical devices.

"So I‘m from Zurich, Switzerland. In the city of Zurich we have about 6 BTC ATM‘s. The process of buying BTC from an ATM is: You get a paper wallet drom the ATM with a public, and a private key. Then you insert money, usually CHF or EUR. The amount of money you insert will be directly converted to BTC. If you inserted the amount you want, you finish, and get a kind of receipt. Then you wait about half an hour, can be varying. And you can withdraw the BTC from the paper wallet, to a other wallet of your choice.

"I can see that to a degree. I think there is another factor a lot of people are missing or I just simply dont see it being discussed and I read these forums and listen to Crypto Youtubers a lot. Here is the deal:  Bitcoin is being taken over by Large Wall Street Entities and Foreign Big Market Players. 

Circle who is Owned by Goldman Sachs just bought Poloniex. This is big. Look at the Digital Currency Group out of New York. https://dcg.co/portfolio/ They are working with a lot of companies to make Bitcoin and ALL Cryptocurrencies(well those that want to utilize the LN) work Mainstream I believe. 

It **feels** like to me, that they attempted to onboard into Bitcoin, But they went in to hot and heavy it clogged up the network. They are just waiting for the LN to be complete. The LN is not for normal users like everyone on this site. the LN is basically the VISA Processor for Big Business for Crypto. So they can do millions of transactions a day and just close out once at the end of the day. Saving Crypto. Without LN, Crypto is dead as it screeches to a halt with Mainstream adoption. The only other choice is to keep abandoning clogged up Networks for Fresh networks(bcash) and when that one gets clogged up go clog up another one. Or bump up the blocksize to 64MB and see who wants to maintain copies of the Blockchain after 5-10 years of usage. 

LN is the Key. Yeah, its rocky right now, but so was Bitcoin when it first started. I heard it was programmed with Spaghetti Code. But soon, we will have a super smooth highway for Big and small business to use so us regular folks can use Bitcoin as it was intended.  ",1523606414

My advice is to set up and automatic exchange of like $20 a week or whatever you would consider pretty much insignificant and to keep up just scan the headlines for bitcoin related news. If the price spike, sell half of what you have and go back to scanning headlines. Your saftey is the low constant investment.

There is also a belief that there is opposition against *ever* scaling on-chain, in BTC. That's simply false. Last year, it was *simply* premature. Yes, I fully know people had to pay high fees in november/december, though decent confirmation times *never* did cost more than $10. I don't have the exact numbers. It's still *too* much for small transactions, but I do not think we should *ever* try to fit every small payment onto the blockchain. It's stupid bloat, unncessery, and *will* lead to centralization.

I understand what you are saying. But I think my perspective is more as of someone who got into bitcoin years ago who has funds in btc already. At the moment fees are low so I suggest anyone with dust or small amounts consolidate while you can. If things go according to plan 1mb blocks will remain full and fees will remain high. That was Gregs stated objective. Which essentially removes people's choice for on chain. Its not an issue for people who have not yet bought in.

"People borrowed btc from the exchanges to short sell them. The borrowers immediately sold the borrowed btc, and were hoping the price would go down so when they had to buy it back to return it, they could make a profit.

In order to be able to borrow the btc, the borrowers had to put up some collateral. The exchanges require that there's a specific margin between the value of the collateral and the value of the btc that was borrowed. So maybe like the collateral has to be worth more than 10% of the btc that was borrowed.

When the price of btc went up, people dropped below the margin and the exchanges liquidated the collateral to buy back the btc they had loaned out.

Hence the short was liquidated.",1523605475
"Yes 100% agree with you. I should have emphasized the 'potential' note in my reply. At this stage it is harder and only (well not only) appeals to those that would like decentralization.  Like you have already stated by saying ""as for now"", or in its current state, it does fall short in those areas but it can mostly definitely be those things. For crypto to be adopted as a true global currency the whole UI will need to be much better. I personally believe there are better use cases for crypto/blockchain than as a true currency.  Partially due to do the average Joe's you speak of. They will not be the ones that fight for decentralization of currency.  

I'm perfectly content with how transactions, etc. are handled today. So instant transactions or many more than current per second doesn't appeal to me. 

What does appeal to me is that a government wouldn't control it. I hesitate to say manipulate it because hell look where we are right now. Manipulation runs rampant. 

Basically I was wrong with my reply based on what they stated, especially being that they stated Bitcoin, a true currency.

"Yo, don't be so quick to count us out. There are a lot of folks in the food and hospitality industries that give a lot of shits about crypto. Just because baking and pastry might be my day job doesn't mean I don't have viable interests outside of work. ;)",1523604867
"Dude, shorters increase the volatility of the market. 

Yes, I'd prefer it to be stagnant when compared to highly volitile. We can expect any merchants to accept Bitcoin in their shops if the price is so unstable.

I'm not generally against shorters, they provide a necessary corrective. But the gamblers can stay away. Hopefully they got burned enough to be more careful in the future.",1523604738
"Eh, idk. The problem with predicting the value of a particular crypto is that because its digital, anyone can come up with a new coin. Its really going to be about who comes up with the coin best suited for modern transactions. Bitcoin has the advantage of being the most well known but as more people understand and start to use bitcoin, more people will understand its limitations and that there are better options.

Ultimatly, its still just a currency and needs to be ""backed up"" to have value. Right now currency is backed up on a national level, which causes a lot of problems because it creates a way and an incentive for currency to be artificially influenced. A global currency that could be traded easily and that was backed up soley by itself and global acceptance as a medium to transfer wealth is ideal, and bitcoin is a step in the right direction, but I don't think it has what it takes to become the global currency.",1523604715
"not really, the risk here is significantly more pronounced, if you just buy a crypto currency, no matter how low it goes, you can still wait for it to go up. if your short/long gets sqeezed, that's it, you lost your money, forever, even if the price went back in your direction",1523604623
"OST. It basically allows any individual or company to mint their own coin. You don't need to know how to code, or have any expertise in crypto currencies, etc. It's literally all done through a few steps on a really simple, informative UI. Public beta testing was just concluded -- a huge success. The main working product is set to roll out soon. The success of OST will be HUGE for the adoption of cryptocurrency. $58m market cap.

"You are either being short sighted or you just want a cheaper Bitcoin to go moon cuz you missed out the first time. Just use Litecoin, its better than Bcash. Or Digibyte. 

Bcash is basically someone taking a good thing and turning it into BASE-ket Ball",1523604526
Yeah but they are not on the blockchain and require you to trust in banks. Its the entire point of crypto to cut out third parties,1523604507
"But in what ways it is ""easier""? In some it is, but in some it's harder. You won't get cashback, you won't get your cash back in case of hack as it is with banks if they are hacked or someone stole your credit card etc. \(as for now\). It is not clear that crypto is ""easier way to handle money"" for average joe. For average joe, especially is he is not smart, the easiest way is to keep money in his mattress or in the pocket.",1523604458

"We broke out of downtrend channel. We just need to stall here a bit and do one more run. Then FOMO will kick in and we will have one more run up in the channel which will create uptrend channel. But all depends on some dueche exchange to manipulate again to clear the longs. This market is manuplated easily either way. May be when the market cap goes up another 100x up, then manuplation will start to reduce a bit. But you can compare the Bitcoin to a human being. A person might look big. But when you compare the mass of that person to the total space in the universe, it is like dust particle. So Bitcoin market cap is a dust particle compared to all the wealth in world. ",1523604407
With Big Ass Bitcoin Engines,1523604391
To be fair the analysis is very good however they seem to be ignoring the fact that we don't want bitcoin to be just an 'asset' but a standard to a new world where cryptocurrency can have a real life use...as a mean to exchange goods and when that becomes reality then its no longer a speculative market. Bankers see it coming this is gonna be a war soon boys xD,1523604371
Because Bitcoin name makes the owners rich.,1523604341
Transaction fee was so high because exchanges didn't adopt segwit fast enough. Now its fine. After adoption of LN the tx fee for normal tx will drop to pennies. I'm 99% certain of that. But people are blinded by stupidity and think they are better than btc or ln devs.,1523604336
"Some changes are coming in mid-May. See the [dev workgroup(s)](https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/workgroups). Particularly [opcodes](https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/workgroups/tree/master/wg-opcodes/summaries) and further capacity increase greater than LTC, BTC and ETH combined.",1523604231
There were digital currencies long before Bitcoin. Look up Digicash. ,1523604182
Agreed and with Stack (STK) now having a partnership with Matercard I don't have to use the banks for anything. I LOVE CRYPTO!,1523604086

"**Hodl**

Hodl (often written HODL; pronounced  HOD-əl) is a slang term and Internet meme that is used in the Bitcoin community when referring to holding the cryptocurrency rather than selling it. It originated in a December 2013 post on the Bitcoin Forum message board by an apparently inebriated user who posted with a typo in the subject, ""I AM HODLING."" In 2017, Quartz listed it as one of the essential slang terms in Bitcoin culture, and described it as a stance, ""to stay invested in bitcoin and not to capitulate in the face of plunging prices."" TheStreet.com referred to it as the ""favorite mantra"" of Bitcoin holders.

Since entering the Bitcoin vernacular, HODL has become a backronym for ""hold on for dear life"".

"&gt; Bitcoin is also concerned with increasing transaction volume, but its solution involved moving some data off the Bitcoin blockchain, therefore keeping the blocks on the blockchain small. This theoretically preserves the spirit of the Bitcoin experiment because small blocks make it cheaper for anyone to run a “node,” which means the network can be run by a giant collective of small users instead of by institutions like banks. 

This is wrong. 

BTC lets more users (still less than 1%) **run** full nodes but it stops most of the users to **use** BTC. This is not what Bitcoin is about. Bitcoin has always been supposed to be **run** by the big miners and **used** by everybody. ",1523603867
"EOS: Could be huge if brings a working product to the table by fixing ETH scaleability issues.
BTC: King of the market, you should always hold onto it.
NEO : It also intents to accomplish the same thing as ETH AND EOS ( Even though I am much more confident about EOS compared to neo) I can't ignore it's potential.
ARK: it is aiming to becoming an one-stop solution for all crypto needs (e.g. cryptocurrency, smart contracts/dApps, side-chains/push-button deployable blockchains for corporations etc. Could be huge too if they can pull through!",1523603802
"Are you going to start using ducks as a currency? No. It's very obvious that cryptocurrency's end game is to be a currency. If a private institution wants to classify them as that, so be it.  You, as a consumer, have a choice whether to use that bank or not. It also should be said that you shouldn't don't get angry with a bank if they feel a person is attempting to collateral their credit against crypto (credit accounts, not checking/savings; aka not a good idea).",1523603743
"Well, I think that they've only banned exchanges. What they DIDN'T ban was peer-to-peer Bitcoin marketplaces! The only P2P platform I know is Paxful, I mean... I use it and it's done well for me. Good people over in India should check it out.",1523603700

"A lot of companies are participating here though.  Bitcoin cash back for major online retailers, no banks rejecting exchanges, Coincheck was an electricity third party (until their hack), etc.

The adoption here seems pretty wide spread.

My friend's mom is even participating as a form of diversification a little bit and she's in her 60s.  She got into it from her own research, before it got hyped, and has no technical background.  So it's reaching normal people, who aren't just trading, more than you might think.",1523603346

"Well you’re an idiot. Maybe, the whales are female because they’re unpredictable and irrational since they manipulate Bitcoin’s prices. But, Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that doesn’t get to choose its own fate. People and investors that.",1523603057
"You seem either sadly misinformed or in despair over your losses. Here’s a paste from an excellent post down below. Ever heard of Hemmingway’s “slowly at first, and then suddenly?” That’s not manipulation. It’s a cascade effect.

tl;dr - short squeeze

People had positions where they bet on BTC to go down in price, called a short position.  To do this, you borrow someone else's BTC, sell it, and buy it back at a lower price.  However, they expect you to pay back the BTC regardless of what actually happens.  

If BTC got too high you could never afford to buy it back with what's in your account, so there's a threshold where the system will automatically close your position/buy BTC before that happens in order to make the lender whole.  Usually this threshold is some percentage of your overall account.  You typically can't short unless you have other assets.

When a lot of people are shorting like this, a cascade can happen.  When the price gets too high, people will have their positions closed for them and BTC will be purchased automatically with their accounts.  Of course, with the buy, the price gets higher.  This causes more short positions to be closed, causing a higher price, and on and on.

If you're not paying attention, the price can get very high and wipe out a large amount of your account.  It's brutal and savage, and people get rekt.",1523603054
"You are not correct. There is no way to short bitcoin, it is impossible. Now you can use the conventional market with options but there is no loaning of coin to cover later.",1523603046

Aside from different prefix, it's identical. Even the interface of the two pages is hilariously similar aside from color theme and the logo.

This is a Zclassic block. You know why it's a Zclassic block and not a BTC block? Because BTCP forked from ZCL.
