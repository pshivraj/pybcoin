"I remember the day a guy paid my friend in Bitcoin for a beer at his bar. 7BTC for that beer, at the time it seemed like a pretty sweet deal for the buyer. 

In the office next door the bar owner had a Gnome Linux desktop machine mining away via CPU. Every hour or so it would just say +50BTC in the console. Nobody much cared. Wasn’t like it was worth anything. 

That bar is long gone now, the owner is long gone too. Monoxide poisoning, in his sleep, accidental, not self inflicted. Whenever I look at the red numbers from buying in December, I think of how lucky I am to still be able to. 

There are worse things to lose than bitcoins and dollars.  RIP Steve.

"Alright, tax season is over. Let's start this up again. We see there a Bitcoincash now. That has to go. It confuses new users. One thing I realized is that US customers is all that matters with regard to price. Refunds are coming now and if the community cares about the future they will keep it simple and easy rather than needing a computer science degree to operate. We see lightning is coming on but without uers, whats the point to scale? These hardforks need to stop now. Mistakes were made and passions ran high but lets move on and ignore the 8/1 fork and move on with 2nd layer. We need better interfaces. Coinbase hurt the market more than anythingby allowing bitcoin cash on its services. If they keep allowing hard forks, no one will invest. There is one bitcoin. adding blocks is just centralizing miners to have more power. Coinbase would be wise to get ride of bitcoin cash and any future hard forks. Enough ideology of the free market will decide. The free market are uneducated and we are just confusing new users. Enough. Apologize, remove it, focus on adoption and ease of use and lets go. This year will be the last time the current generation gives bitcoin a second look. 2 weeks all.... enough of editors allowing FUD. Lets get this right in the next month and take back the years lost that bitcoin cash and coinbase cost us. Get to work. ",1523170550

"Yes definitely! Like the directions many different tokens will take, many will also have no reason for value at all. On of the projects I hold is WaBi, yet their token is only used as a loyalty point. Their RFID tech will work whatever the price of the token is, even though its needed as a utility. So no indeed, I don't think mass adoption means an increase in value. Many projects can go up or down (and perhaps die) and as the article mentions a few factors of why it can happen but other assumptions can be made too. As you mentioned Stack (similar to Req?) I don't think either of these projects will survive. To add a personal assumption, either Bitcoin (or LTC, nano, *-insert currency coin-*) becomes a currency or otherwise survive as stores of value and centralised companies (I use a Wirex debit card, has shapeshift so I can even spend all my cryptos, love it) will take their places. Many have had their ico's but I don't think these were great investments at all. Personally I also think many ico's will move towards a security instead of forcing a utility to get out of certain security regulations.",1523170087
"So many people ""just want to break even"" now because they didn't get the moonshot they wanted or thought it would just keep going up. These people also probably overinvested and they have since lowered their price targets for taking profits because that means they get their money back sooner. This game probably isn't for you, or at least it isn't for you at the amount you have invested.

Since last year the media went from publishing warnings from big money telling people it was a bubble and to avoid crypto, to considering it as a viable investment vehicle and adding it their product catalogs. Shit, Goldman Sachs-backed Circle bought Poloniex. Institutional money has been getting their shit together so they can get a piece of the pie. What do you think is going to happen when the average person can invest in crypto through their financial advisor or large financial institution? I am extremely bullish on crypto for 2018/2019 and the next decade. You might not get in the green this month or next, but it will happen unless you are holding bags of shitcoins (and even then it might still happen). You have to be patient otherwise you're giving your money to people more patient than you.

Regarding price, the upside potential in the market is way, way higher right now than it was in December and January. I've only been in crypto since November 2017. Most of my crypto was purchased in December (85% ETH at the time) and I have been investing any time I have disposable money since February. I have gained, lost, and made some very stupid and smart decisions. As of right now my portfolio is down 9.3% from the fiat I put in since November. I have converted zero crypto back to fiat, which was a mistake. I should have cashed out my ETH on January 9, but hadn't yet learned to identify sell signals. Fortunately, I've been able to preserve some capital due to some large swing trades I did when bad news temporarily drove down prices of certain crypto. I digress.

Right now is the time to be greedy.",1523170025

"The ""monero classic"" move is pretty dickish, and not likely to stand since they made it a feature of the cryptocurrency from day 1 that it be ASIC resistant. 

For all that, when it comes to BTC / BCH / et al I don't think ASICs are a bad thing necessarily since ASICs force the miner to mind the currency they're mining and act in its best interest since higher value means more profit - as opposed to GPU / CPU miners who can hop to whichever cryptocurrency is most profitable.

Ideas were floated which would have automatically increased block sizes according to some schedule which would have been outside of the influence of any human.  There were many other ideas as well.

Also I believe they want both. A centralized and decentralized exchange. Because if one day they are at legal trouble whit their centralized one, they still have the decentralized one that can’t be taken down. Ensuring their market share.

"I mean none of this is true really. What lead Dev is banning people? Name one? 

Dev team doesn't get most of its funding from banks. Some Devs do work at a company (blockstream) which had AXA (which is an insurer) as an investor (among other investor). Those Devs contribute to a minority of total commits and only 1 of them has commit access. Also most those Devs have been contributing to bitcoin before it got funding and their contract include closes which prevents company to tell them what to do regarding bitcoin protocol. 

Blockstream has done pretty cool stuff over the years as well lile bitcoin satellite or their own LN client (although imo not as good as LND's), they've also funded research and their Devs and researchers are responsible for some cool papers (including scriptless scripts and CTs - plenty others).

Regardless their ideas are also subjected to same standard every other contributor is subjected to.  You have other companies (like MIT, chain code lab) that employ bitcoin contributors and account for more commits than blockstream does. Bitmain also gave some grants to a Dev, so does coinbase etc so quite a diverse source of findings (lots of others don't get any funding at all). 

Do point me to a crypto project with more diverse group of developers and a transparent governance mechanism, I'm genuinely interested. 

Regarding returns in fiat then for sure last year (unless you invested in the wrong multiple alts that went to shit) would have given a much better ROI than purely holding bitcoin. Doesn't mean it will be true in the future tho and doesn't mean a thing if you didn't cash out as well. 

But anybody with eyes can see lots of those projects have not enough users or value props to justify the market caps they achieved in Jan or last June and a lot of alt investors also would have faired better in buying bitcoin than whatever alt flavor of the months was shilled here.

Bitcoin is the safest bet atm in CCs but of course probably won't give you the highest return short term. Personally I love to grow my bitcoin stack and invest accordingly in some alts. However I'm not delusional enough to think most of those coins will be anywhere close to where they've been at or currently are at in the next couple years and I know a lot of them will die like a lot of others did before. 

Also not delusional enough to think alts got anywhere close to the amount of research and development (general mindshare) and more importantly security that Bitcoin has.",1523167608

"Good point, I think.

So, I just upvoted you mostly because I noticed you have been downvoted. I really don't have a clue what most are talking about on either side of these bitcoin/bitcoin cash (btc) subreddits. I just don't have the time to do the research and probably I'm just not smart enough to take a stand and wave a flag for either kingdom. 

All I know the passions are strong. On one post about a month ago on the bitcoin sub someone talked about how he just bought some chutney dip using bitcoin. The puns flew about buying on the ""dip"". I added my own humor, something to do about chips. Then sincerely asked what the transaction fee was. I guess a few thought I was being rhetorical and got downvoted to minus 2. 

You see some of us on Reddit are interested in cryptocurrency because we use it as an actual currency. Not for investment speculation. Not for darknet markets. But for the grey net market. There are some legal analog tryptamine and lysergic compounds sold by vendors who can't get credit card companies to support them. So some of us ""hippies"" are taking advantage, stocking up while we can. Bitcoin was the go to currency for awhile. Then sometime before and after the hardfork on 8/1, bitcoin wasn't feasible for this. Litecoin and Ethereum and others were the go to currencies for these vendors. Maybe bch too (?).

Judge us as using cryptocurrencies in nefarious ways, but at least we have given them value as a working currency. So me, having some bitcoin stuck in a wallet because the tx fees became too high, I asked a sincere question and get a couple downvotes for the first time. I was a bit taken back.

I shake it off. Tread lightly on the respective subreddits. A few months later I read a comment on the Futurama subreddit that lightly (I thought) makes a dig on the Simpsons. It gets a lot of upvotes.  I can't help but notice the similarities. Futurama and The Simpsons  have the same creator.  I try to make a joke about how Bender (a self server robot) would make use of the rivalries between different subreddits and place carefully crafted comments on competing subreddits like bitcoin and btc, just to rack up karma points. That would definitely be in his character. No allegiance to anything.

Problem was I may have been under the influence of a plant that may or may not have been legal in my State. So the reference to the commenter's upvotes was not made clear by my ""joke"". And probably most Futurama fans (like the majority of humans) are unaware of the extremely strong feelings between the bitcoin/bitcoin cash loyalists. The ""joke"" fell flat and may have been misinterpreted. 

In a few hours I got 61 downvotes. I was devastated. Imagine being on Reddit for about 6 months and only getting 2 or 3 downvotes total,  then suddenly getting hammered by downvotes from people of your own ilk. I mean I have watched every  episode of Futurama at least twice. I have never met anyone in real life-face to face who has admitted to seeing more than a few episodes. My best friend thinks it's a stupid cartoon. I met a couple people who may have seen a few and think it's kinda funny. 

Then I find a virtual community of like minded folks and in one poorly worded comment I'm shunned by them. Now I know how Zoidberg feels.

So that is why I upvoted you, dglod!

"1. The community of bitcoin can be considered cancerous because it's a meritocracy and yeah feelings are not often people's priority. But it's a reflection of crypto as a whole. It often appears cancerous  since only loudest voices are heard. However if you look passed Reddit for example or Twitter and go to where innovation happens (github repos and slack channels and not necessarily bitcoin ones but all other OSS projects building on it).

2. Not sure why you think it's outdated tech. Lots of actual blockchain innovation comes from bitcoin Dev research (mast, schnorr, scriptless script, ct, bullet proof, segwit etc..) and is often added to altcoins. They are pretty conservative in what is actually added to the protocol but that's because it requires a high level of technical and community consensus and safety/security is prioritised over adding the latest unproven/untested  tech.

3. A subreddit has nothing to do with a coin especially when none of the actual bitcoins Devs are mods.. the fact you think so reflects more on you than on bitcoin. Most of the actual tech discussion happens on github and opened mailing lists and is of pretty high quality.

4. No development team was hijacked. In fact lots of the early Devs  (2010/2011 etc) apert from the loudest ones (aka Gavin/Mike/Jeff)  are still working on the project. There's a pretty balanced and diverse list of contributors as well (more than any other crypto project for that matter). And it's even better than back  &lt;= 2013 since now there's truly no leaders.

Again development team is one of the most competent out there. A lot of academics working on it, lots of blockchain improvements actually done by bitcoin Devs etc..  check the github repo and the actual code, you'll see the code quality is pretty great. You can easily find credentials and experience of most of the bitcoin contributors and researchers and see they actually know their shit (from fixing bug in open SSL, rewriting an ecsda curve which is now widely used in most crypto projects, being part of Linux kernel Dev etc....)

&gt; Slow growth due to marketcap

Not sure what that even means.

Tbh your reaction tells me that you're pretty cancerous and has some serious hate going on. But that's fine, bitcoin will still be bitcoin despite your current ignorance!

Good luck tho on whatever project you are into, would love to see the github repos of those so I can check them out, I'm sure it will be an outstanding display of diverse contributors, open governance process and innovation. Always opened to learning!",1523165867

So instead of getting $700, you only get 628.32.  You've paid 11% for the privilege of using a bitcoin ATM.   That's worse than using a CoinStar!",1523165679

"Hi,

Thank you for sharing your experience. I was thinking of having Tyson Cross' law firm prepare my taxes as well.

I do have a follow-up question on the like-kind exchange treatment on Form 8824:
How did Tyson Cross end up reflecting Part II of the Form 8824 (Related party exchange information; lines 8 - 11)? How do you know who you traded your crypto with, and whether or not the party you traded with, sold or disposed the like-kind property? Did Tyson Cross end up attaching a justification letter for 11c?

The above-mentioned Part II (lines 8-11) seem to be sticking points that might disallow like-kind exchange treatment for crypto.

I know that Tyson Cross wrote an article in Forbes recently suggesting that he is inclined to treat crypto-to-crypto exchanges as like-kind crypto:
https://www.forbes.com/sites/tysoncross/2018/02/19/the-truth-about-cryptocurrency-and-like-kind-exchanges/#1f92dfd16fd1

However, it is interesting that back in 2014 Tyson Cross himself suggested that like-kind exchange treatment for crypto is unlikely to fly:
http://bitcoinassociation.org/bitcoin-tax-treatment-part-1/

In addition, other information online does not seem to favor the treatment of crypto-to-crypto exchanges as like-kind exchanges:

All of these coins can’t and won’t be used. Mass adoption of P2P will boil down to one winner. NANO seems to have the best tech, and the worst marketing/market position currently.

BTC: the above doesn’t even mention Bitcoin, which could knock out all of the previous mentioned coins.

XRP/XLM: People love XLM and hate XRP. They are literally the same coin with a different name. Apparently Ripple’s protocol/potential use case doesn’t really need the coin. XLM has an IBM partnership that hasn’t been fleshed out completely, and FairX exchange which has been teasing some super secret revelation lately. I don’t really have an opinion on the future of either.

EOS/ADA: huge market caps for coins with no real products. Thoughts continued in the next category.

ETH/NEO: Apparently 70% of dApps are games. This isn’t world changing. It’s yet to be seen whether any world changing applications actually need DLT. Remember, changing the world doesn’t just require creating an app that is better than the status quo, it also requires convincing the public to use it. Just an example, how does REQ convince the public to switch away from Venmo or PayPal?

Monero/Verge: Same problems as LTC/BTC/NANO/BCH, and then add regulatory issues governments will have with privacy coins.

IOTA: Technical issues to be solved, such as getting a high enough transactions per second to remove the coordinator, is the cryptography actually secure etc.

DASH: I literally never see anyone mention DASH, yet it’s consistently on the top 15. I know nothing about it honestly, and I follow crypto forums relatively closely.

I know I haven’t covered them all. I don’t know enough about the rest to have an opinion. TRX seems scammy. Who is developing ETC, and what future does it have? VEN seems to have a lot of big news that may or may not be over-hyped. I still don’t know what XEM does.

&gt; There is a feedback loop between hashrate and price

There is no feedback loop in price and hashrate.

The overall demand for the coin compared to the overall supply of the coin determines the price, money flowing in from investors and speculators not involved in mining.

Increased prices increases the daily total revenue generated by block rewards, which increases the demand for mining hardware, which increases the total hashrate over time beyond what you expect from pure technological advancements. 

You can lookup the daily inflation of a coin (how many Coins are released as mining rewards times the price per coin) and that will be the portion of the total hashrate that is dedicated to that coin on average.

It does not matter if a SHA256 coin is bad, 100kb blocks, high minimum fees, forced adress reuse with no privacy, 1 hour blocktimes. If the total amount of buyers have put up enough orders to buy one days worth of mined coins for 1.8 BTC worth of USD, there will be around 0.1%  of the total hashrate dedicated to mining that coin.

Miners only care about one thing on average, what they can earn mining today compared to the operating costs of mining, they do not mine coins for ideological reasons, and investors do not care about total hashrates as they lag behind the market by weeks and months.",1523161839

I have done some traveling in this country. Everything revolves around politics and bureaucracy. From what I read Modi is not doing so great at polls for next years election and cannot afford to lose majority. Political parties generally gear up with illegal transactions to buy alliances. So its very likley they decided to restrict crypto for this purpose. Its a shame though that they are missing out on a technological revolution with a large youth demography.,1523161737

"Certainly I agree that, in general, argument from authority is not proof, but it makes a reasonable proxy when you have non-experts arguing with experts. I am not an expert on bitcoin. I don't think you claimed to be either, and if I recall correctly you said you haven't read E&amp;S's or Wright's papers carefully. So it's not unreasonable to think that someone like Sirer who has an extensive track record of research in cryptocurrency is much more likely to be correct than any two non-experts.

I'm glad we agree that the model stands as long as the original assumptions hold, and sure, it's plausible that the SM strategy may not work in the real world if some assumptions fail. That has been discussed in other papers like, for example, this one by (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.1718.pdf)[Courtois &amp; Bahack]. Like most mathematical models, it is somewhat idealised and simplifying assumptions have to be made to make calculations tractable, but as far as I know there haven't been any convincing arguments that the E&amp;S's result is wrong given their assumptions. I think you're taking some of E&amp;S's words too literally here. 'Honest' is being used in the sense that the HMs rigorously follow the bitcoin protocol. If they change their strategy because they notice a selfish miner they are no longer 'honest' in that strict sense only. Calling it a 'loosely connected network' is not a technical statement that is right or wrong, it's just some roughly descriptive text, and they don't consider the network topology in their model anyway.

The original criticism from Wright's paper that you thought invalidated E&amp;S was that they used a Poisson distribution instead of a negative binomial or an Erlang distribution. I don't think that argument is valid, for a couple of reasons.

* Both a Poisson distribution and a binomial distribution describe probabilities of discrete events ie. the random variable corresponds to a count of the number of occurrence in a given time (Poisson) or after a given number of trials (binomial). They are different distributions, but it happens that when the number of trials is large and the probability of success is small, the binomial distribution can be approximated very well by a Poisson distribution.

* The Erlang distribution is a continuous distribution where the random variable is the time between successes. For the time between 2 successes it is just the exponential distribution P(T &gt; t) = 1 - exp(-lambda*t). That is exactly the distribution for intervals between successes you get from the Poisson distribution.

* The ""negative binomial"" distribution corresponds to the distribution of the number of Bernoulli trials until success, so it could be considered the binomial distribution equivalent of the Erlang distribution.

So firstly it doesn't make sense to say that the process would be better modeled by a negative binomial or Erlang distribution, because that would be replacing the Poisson model (which is about the number of occurences) with something entirely different, a distribution that describes intervals between successes. Secondly, the Erlang distribution is already the correct model for intervals between successes when the Poisson distribution is used to model occurrences. If you wanted to be really pedantic, you could use the binomial distribution to model occurrences and the negative binomial for intervals (trials between successes) but it just makes the calculations more complicated while yielding almost the same results.",1523161449

Alice and Bob are fictional characters commonly used as placeholder names in cryptology, as well as science and engineering literature.

Subsequently, they have become common archetypes in many scientific and engineering fields, such as quantum cryptography, game theory and physics. As the use of Alice and Bob became more popular, additional characters were added, each with a particular meaning.

Point A) that's $3/transaction.  Sure if you take out $20 and pay $3 you are paying 15%.  That $3 is fixed though.  If you take out $100 the fee is 3%.  If you take out $300 the fee is now 1%.

"I recently posted this on a 401K/IRA thread.. related and may be of interest to you.

Here’s what you can do if it fits your investment strategy for retirement planning. You can use a retirement (IRA) to invest in crypto and you will never have to pay taxes on your gains. It is what I have done with some of my retirement plans. I’ll give you the main points and let you do the research if your interested.

There is a little known secret known as a “Self Directed Checkbook IRA”

It’s basically structured like this:

-establish a Traditional or Roth IRA with a passive custodian. (Being that you are young, a Roth might be the way to go, because the money you put in is post-tax and therefore never taxed again)

-fund the IRA 

-establish an LLC which is 100% owned by the IRA. 

-you are appointed as the Manager of the LLC 

-IRA funds are transferred to LLC account in exchange for 100% share of the LLC.

-Invest in almost any traditional or non-traditional investments such as stocks, bonds, etc and real-estate, tax liens, precious metals and pretty much anything that can demonstrate a market value. The IRS doesn’t say what you can invest in only what you can’t, which is a pretty short list.

The main thing is that all gains and earnings of the LLC go back into the IRA and you personally can’t benefit from it directly until you retire as per normal IRA rules.

The beauty is, especially with a Roth, no taxes EVER. With a Traditional IRA you wouldn’t be taxed til 59 1/2 at which point your money would have work for you tax free and your tax bracket would likely be much lower than it would be now when your earning most of your money.

Anyway, this may sound complicated and you can do the legwork to set this all up on your own or there are service providers that pretty much do everything including setting up the Ira and the LLC. Of course they do charge a premium for the set up. 

I went through IRA Financial Group and it was a smooth painless process and took about 12 days to set up.

Just look up “Checkbook IRA” and you’ll get all the info you need.

Good luck! I’m open to questions 👍

"I agree with your points, it will be a process of survival like the dot com bubble. However I think this is not the main discussion.

I am going to change the question:  Do you think the winning and mass adopted utility coins of the future will increase in value?

For example: 

**Bluzelle:** They are a Decentralized Database Service. BLZ tokens will be the utility exchange coin to transact operations between users. However, Bluzelle will make money by charging fees. As long as volume increases, BLZ company won't be affected negatively. Doesn't matter what price the token is.

**Stack Token:** They have a partnership with Mastercard and will provide the service to easily pay with any crypto at any point of sale. STK token will be the state channel to make the transactions and a fee will be charged (USD fixed but in STK tokens).

"I have read the thread in full multiple times. My TLDR stands. Greg was explaining how high fees are actually a good thing because when the block reward subsidy goes away we will need people to paying at least that high of fees to do on-chain transactions. His interpretation of December's fee event was:

1. This proves my idea to make on-chain transactions super expensive and permanently congested can work.
2. The market doesn't really mind paying such high fees obviously. If they did more people would use Segwit.
3. The traffic is fake anyway.

Nowhere in here did he acknowledge what a failure it was for Bitcoin Core to have allowed the fees to go this high. Tech companies employ people with pagers and have them work round the clock to make sure that there are no availability drops as severe as what we saw in December.

"&gt; Well, first of all your claim was that it's enough to just use a different change address. Now you are agreeing that it's not enough and you need yet another wallet?

From a third party perspective, it's impossible to tell if a payment is going to another wallet, or to another address within the same wallet. You can either send to another wallet, *or* send to n address within the same wallet, it doesn't matter. Both ways will result in private BTC usage.

&gt; In reality chain analysis builds a graph over time, and the probability of success depends on how many txs you make and how much information they can extract from other sources, like cookies.

You're talking about a different kind of chain analysis than what I'm talking about. If you have corroborating evidence then you can probably convict on that evidence alone, you don't need chain analysis.

I'm talking about chain analysis where the only evidence brought forth is from the blockchain. For instance if the prosecutor has a TX that is proven to be a drug deal, and another TX that is proven to be yours, and then they try to prove the links between them. This ""proof"" is impossible, and any defence lawyer can pick the analysis apart and the jury won't buy it. Obviously if they gave GPS data and cookies and stuff like that, then you may be toast.

&gt; Remember, all they need is to show beyond reasonable doubt that you are guilty.

If their case involves guessing that an address belongs to your wallet, then there is reasonable doubt that they guessed wrong.

&gt; And please don't endanger users with simplistic claims that new change addresses make a wallet absolutely untrackable,

Obviously this is not what I'm saying. Using bitcoin anonymously is *possible*, but not guaranteed under every circumstance. If you're selling drugs out of your coinbase account, you'll probably get busted. If you send the coin from coinbase to a burner wallet, and then make a new burner wallets as you go, you'll be OK. If you send money from the burner wallet to your coinbase account, you may get busted. OpSec is an artform. No cryptocurrency, even ZCash and Monero can guarantee every user 100% opsec at all times. If you go posting your monero addresses everywhere and telling everyone you're buying drugs with monero, you can get busted too.",1523153171

"Most people who have money to invest in Bitcoin are already banked. For them, Bitcoin is just a speculative asset. The unbanked don't want to buy Bitcoin because they often have no money that they can afford to lose: every cent counts. Every conversion of fiat to BCH and vice versa is an expense, at least $1 is lost in various exchange fees or middleman costs, which is still a lot of money for the unbanked.

If BCH's fiat price is stable or grows steady over time, then even the unbanked would have a strong incentive to buy coins, at least a tiny amount, as it wouldn't be a risky investment. As people buy Bitcoin, it's value grows, because of increased demand.

Why BTC haven't reached any wider adoption than it has now? Why BTC didn't manage to bank at least 10% of the unbanked in 2012, 2014, 2016, when network fees were very low? And why would it be any different with BCH? I can't find an answer to these questions yet.",1523149544

Bitcoin belongs to what the rest of the article deals with:

""**Speculative instruments are not stores of value**. They may ""have value"" when purchased, but are not ""a reasonably stable store of future value"". As mentioned above, the key to defining if an asset can be considered a store of value, is that it can predictably retain purchasing power into the future.

At various times throughout history, people and nations have famously made the mistake of believing that they could ""store value"" in speculative instruments, misunderstanding that **ones personal choice to invest in a speculative asset does not automatically convert that asset into a proper and predictable store of value**.""",1523149444

This doesn't make every single way they extract that data justifiable, but you need to grasp how important this shift truly is. 

Also, on the topic of the article, blocking crypto ads was phenomenal - it reduced the visibility of scams immensely. When do you think an amazing ICO has ever relied on Twitter ads to find success?

"&gt; Store of value is not the same as being immune to inflation/deflation. It means that if you have 1BTC, It cant be taken away from you because of its fixed supply, immutability and cryptographic keys.

I will skip the rest of your obvious misunderstandings, but this one to ignore.  ""Store of value"", is a standard term, means pretty much what it says and your ""re-definition"" is bizarre.   Sample this:

*A store of value is the function of an asset that can be saved, retrieved and exchanged at a later time, and be predictably useful when retrieved. More generally, a store of value is anything that retains purchasing power into the future.*
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Store_of_value

See if you can relate bitcoins wild volatility to ""predictably useful when retrieved"".    Perhaps a ""contra-example"" will help you.   Right now, I have $10 in my pocket; in a week I will go to KFC and there use my $10 to get same type of meal that I got today; both KFC and I can rely on $10 having pretty much the same value next week that it does now.   Store of value.

On the other hand, nobody can count on what one can do with bitcoin on a weekly basis.  Not even on a daily basis.   And fixed supply, immutability and cryptographic keys are of absolutely no help in that regard.

"I'm going to play devil's advocate, but as long as bitcoin is treated as an asset (which it technically is since overall adoption is still very low and the closest comparison we have for it is gold) you don't really need to play any taxes on it. 

If you sell something and you get bitcoin for it you don't need to pay taxes on it. You can trade the bitcoin for goods or sell it for Fiat. If you sell it for Fiat you need to pay taxes based on how much you sold the bitcoin for. I think this makes sense since it takes into account the volatility of bitcoin as well.

I think there's always going to be someone selling bitcoin for Fiat so in the end the taxes for it are payed. If bitcoin floats around between 10-20 people or small business before that happens I don't see a problem with it. It means the economy is improving and most of those people will sell something that's usefull to others. In the end everyone that uses bitcoin benefits from it.

As of right now I doubt bitcoin purchases account for even 1% of total sells in any given business that accepts bitcoin. If I were to guess I'd say that if you have a business that accepts bitcoin you'd probably have like 0.25-0.5% of your earnings in bitcoin. Compared to your earnings in fiat that amount is simply irrelevant.

If it ever gets to the point that 10, 20 or 50 years in the future bitcoin overtakes fiat and everyone is payed in bitcoin we'd probably have a new system where you send part of your bitcoins to fund certain projects either worldwide or within smaller communities. Now you'd probably say that this way no projects are ever funded, but honestly I think people would just fund the projects they find usefull. In a way we'd have proper democracy.",1523147630

*From:* https://www.inc.com/business-insider/stripe-no-longer-accepts-bitcoin-payments-goobye-april-23.html

""Stripe, the $9 billion online payments company, is putting an end to the product that enabled retailers to accept bitcoin as payment.

Citing a decrease in use by both retailers and customers, Stripe said will wind down support for its bitcoin payment application and stop processing bitcoin payments entirely on April 23.

""**Empirically, there are fewer and fewer use cases for which accepting or paying with Bitcoin makes sense**,"" Stripe product manager Tom Karlo wrote in the announcement. 

When Stripe first enabled bitcoin payment process in 2014, advocates for the cryptocurrency believed that it could be a cheaper than credit cards like Visa, which charge seller-side customers a fee on top of each transaction, and more accessible to people in part of the world without banks or stable currencies. 

""Our hope was that Bitcoin could become a universal, decentralized substrate for online transactions and help our customers enable buyers in places that had less credit card penetration or use cases where credit card fees were prohibitive,"" Karlo wrote in the blog entry.

After some reading, ok not much of a loss regardless.  In 2017, ""hey buy one of these bitcoins only a few thousand.""  After some reading seems cool, but very risky for that kind of money.  
Yes, Mathematically and no it is not the same.  investing a few hundred for a coin a few years ago is very different than investing a few thousand for the same amount.  Say btc reaches 100k at one point 10k for 10% of a coin is more of a risk than it was at $1000 or even $100 if the volatility remains the same.  If you have been in this space for more than 6 months you realize it was easy to drop a weekend of beer money on a risky asset and forget about it in the past.  Investing a few grand now for a significant portion is much different, even if you could afford to lose it.  I understand what you are saying a loss of 80% is a loss of 80%, but I wasn't investing thousands for a coin only hundreds.  Some folks might be investing thousands now and thousands years ago.  I, however, made my investments in % of btc not $ total.  This is why alt coins went crazy people didn't want a % they wanted substantial coinage with a few hundred dollars just like bitcoin use to be.   
In the future buying a small % of btc that might not have that much more room to grow, but could still have 60% volatility is going to be a bad gamble.  ",1523145505
"To clarify; 

Our lawyer and the one that filed for CR, who are working in tandem, have both indicated that the sentiment of creditors is a helpful tool in persuading the trustee and the court at this time.

In the future creditors will be called on to vote on a CR plan (hopefully). Most are uninformed and unconnected with the process or its consequences. Our aim of growing the group is to help with both of these challenges. 

You have never offered to send this mail. You alluded and hinted you might, but when it came to it you've always found an excuse not to. This is another example. It's fine Mark, I accept you won't do it. 

Asking the trustee. That's a good idea, I'll ask the Trustee, although we both know he's unlikely to do it. I don't see that you're bound by the same constraints as he is though so you have no reason to refuse. 

You're right. I was trying to get you to send this email. Not by manipulation though, but by stating some unsaid facts. And it's not on my behalf. It's on behalf of 900+ creditors and on behalf of the ones that don't yet know we exist but would like to join it and benefit from it. 

The court is many things but it's not been a practical source of information.

There is strong evidence you cooked the books. There is evidence being cited in your trial against you in which you are charged of embezzlement. And there is evidence you yourself have published. When Jeb told you 80k btc had been stolen from the exchange you as CEO chose not to come clean and tell creditors. Three months later you moved 424k btc in a bid to deflect claims gox was short on reserves. I believe that was a gratuitous attempt to mislead creditors to the state of Gox accounts. At no time did you declare to creditors there was an 80k btc shortfall until after Gox went into bankruptcy. I think a libel court would accept ""cooking the books"" as a fair representation of your actions there. ",1523145484

"You really should think a bit before you rush to the keyboard.   By way of encouraging you, let me give you just a small example: in order to receive BTC payment in that wallet, a business must calculate a fiat price in BTC.   Why, because it is fiat that is the real money; that is how he pays his suppliers, for utilities, rent, etc.   Now, how often does, say BTC/USD price change?  The never-ending cries of anguish on the ""Daily Discussion"" thread should give you an idea.   Then you have the whole business of having to wait for confirmations and what-not.   Are you starting to get the idea?   Good.   

Thinking of using third parties to ease the pain?   Sample this:

**Stripe, the $9 billion online payments company, is putting an end to the product that enabled retailers to accept bitcoin as payment.**
.....
**Citing a decrease in use by both retailers and customers, Stripe said will wind down support for its bitcoin payment application and stop processing bitcoin payments entirely on April 23.**

No old skool tech businesses could understand how the internet could work with no patents... And a whole bunch of those companies rather than embracing the internet, tried instead to compete with different protocol concepts... before they finally grokked why the more open protocol would eventually prevail and shifted focus to building stuff on it, rather than trying to compete.

A whole lot of time was wasted, but a whole lot of important stuff was learnt along the way by all 'sides'.  That's literally what's just happened in the 'blockchain' space.  

What's more, all those trying to compete with bitcoin via esoteric blockchain concepts were told all this was going to happen (5 years ago) by those very greybeards that were all here the first time around...  And, funnily enough, knew that just like the first time around, they would be pooh-poohed for not understanding 'business', just as Bill Gates laughed at Larry and Sergey for not 'understanding' business (Bill said he'd give Google 'a year' before they went under).

I think that Tether is mildly brilliant, but like a lot of things in bitcoin-land can quickly get flipped onto it's ear and become an exit scam / bankruptcy, and get that spun into losses for people who were holding Tethers and who hoped to either buy bitcoin, or get dollars with their Tethers.

So how I see it, you get some bank accounts in a country, and people of that country deposit to it, and some do withdrawls, but they're all ""locals"". From the banks point of view, there are no unknown persons here. If the Tether people were super smart, they would insist that people have bank accounts at the same bank. Then there's not even any settlement, it would all be just money moving between pockets at a bank, and the bigger the bank, the more customers could be pocketed, and the less any cash leaves their system (it would only exist digitally). So ING in the Netherlands is a great example.

Now out at the people controlling Tether between exchanges, they can do a net settlement with the Tether company (bitfinex people wearing a corporate veil actually), and exchanges, but from the banks point of view, there is no volume of money moving around. 

Tether *hides* the volumes being transacted here.  It puts banks to sleep. They have less odd multimillion dollar wires to report. It makes the exchanges activities much more opaque and less the banks problem. What they don't see they won't block or can't block.

It is a way to alleviate the pressure on the network caused by small and numerous transactions which do not really have to rely on instant on-chain settlement (but still could if necessary, for example if one of the party seems dishonest) and can be settled at a later time to take advantage of lower fees. LN also facilitates other features such as atomic swaps for example, even if it helped only in this area it would mean a lot for the whole cryptocurrencies ecosystem. Based on this, hating on it makes no sense technologically, as much as praising it as a be-all and end-all solution to scaling.

I hold the exact same opinion on people who believe block size will never be increased on Bitcoin, excluding this possibility is so limiting. It makes no sense and when doing it will not imply massive long term trade offs for decentralization, it will be possible to achieve it if people do not entrench themselves in such absolutists positions (""I want TB/unlimited blocksize"" / ""Blocksize should never be upgraded or should be lowered""). If nobody calls out people making these claims it will be become harder and harder to get social consensus on this issue when necessary. Sorry if I went a bit on a tangent but I felt like this was kinda related as I keep seeing people with such absolute/extreme views on both sides of the debate and this wasn't specifically pointing at you.",1523142943

"Thought of your comment when I read Satoshi's introduction to Bitcoin. 

&gt;The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts. Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible.

[Source](http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source)

The motivation really was about inflation and credit bubbles, like I talked about in the post. All currencies have this problem. He said that the history of fiat currencies is full of central banks debasing the currency, and implies he doesn't trust that won't happen again.  It's no coincidence Bitcoin was created right after the financial crisis of 2008. Bitcoin was all about creating an alternative option to our current financial system. Satoshi made libertarian and Austrian economics statements against inflation, over extending credit, bank bailouts, and fractional reserve banking.    ",1523142689

"Craig S Wright is currently the worlds greatest purveyor of the finest, purest, handcrafted, artisnal, organic and gluten free vegan bullshit.

His brand of crap is so pure, science has yet to find a way to quantify and measure it. It defies all known science.

Rumour has it the main problem is the intense smugness surrounding him. In the same way that in quantum physics, the act of observation changes the measurement, observing Wright's crapwave increases his smugness which via some sort of self aggrandising feedback loop changes the purity.

Another problem is, his bullshit can exist in three different quantum states with four possible outcomes that can change upon observation. Either he believes it himself, idiots believe it or nobody believes it or indeed all three simultaneously. If unobserved entirely, then none of these states. A kind of Schrodingers paradox of sorts.

Take for example, a speech he may deliver at a crowded venue typical of him and his associates...lets say one of Roger Vers backyard barbeques, with 5 put of 6 of the chairs occupied. At the time of delivery only Wright believes what he is saying as nobody else there cares (they're chatting amongst themselves enjoying the free booze) and/or they are people paid to be there. However, upon publication of a video to the Internet the state of the bullshit changes because now it has been observed by the people at /r/btc. Ergo due to observation the state is now ""some people believe it"". Eventually the video will make it to /r/bitcoin whereupon it is called out as bullshit. Another observation, another change in state. Now nobody believes it because /r/btc tangentially start talking about censorship, satoshis vision, fees etc therefore no longer acknowledging the bullshit.

Many scientists have considered that it may not be a quantifiable variable but a universal constant, since regardless of the state, it's all still bullshit.

Further to this, after drawing a curve with a red marker on a whiteboard, some beard scratching and then erasing the curve scientists have concluded that  in sometime during his lifetime CSW will probably make the following claims:

1. He cracked the Voynich Manuscript.
2. He invented the Antikythera Mechanism.
3. He knows and has coffee with Lord Lucan.
4. He can fold a 1m square sheet of paper more than 12 times.

Less likely, but also possible:

1. He will claim to be Lord Lucan.
2. He will claim to know what was in the briefcase in Pulp Fiction.
3. He will claim to be able to throw a shoe over a block of flats 30 stories high.
4. He wrote the Voynich Manuscript.

So there you have it folks. Even science can't accurately measure or predict the CSW reality distortion effect. It is still a hot topic of debate.

The only thing known for sure is that he is full of shit and will, for reasons even the smartest people on Earth can't fathom, keep producing more and more of it and keep being paid for it.

Thanks for the lolz. The real Bitcoin engineers have left the ship long ago.

&gt; So which is it? Lightning is a centralised hub and spoke system, or lightning is decentralised? Pick one. 

You tell me. Bitcoin Core developers can't make up their mind, they only say that routing in the Lightning Network will work somehow, by divine intervention I guess, defying the law of physics. Not one Bitcoin Core supporter has been able to explain how decentralized routing will work. I can tell you that routing will be:

1. Either a hub and spoke topology, with a few trusted and nodes
2. A decentralised routing model that cannot scale and that most lileky has greater bandwitdth requirements than Bitcoin Cash's on-chain scaling requirements.

In other words, LN doesn't bring any advantages compared to on-chain scaling combined with SPV nodes, but in fact adds a lot of disadvantages.

But hey, you don't have to believe me, but if I were you I would seriously research this subject and don't accept at face value that routing will work ""somehow"".",1523141662

Hmm...

&gt; The very long term viability, centuries ahead, of Bitcoin depends on preventing the runaway growth of the UTXO set

This is the opening statement and it contains an assertion that seems to fall from the sky. I have two things to say about it;

1. a worry about a software being able to run 100 years from now may be postponed quite a bit. Maybe your worry is wrong.
2. My experience in working on this stuff shows you are wrong. The technology scales amazingly well and there are much better ways to solve the issues when actual scaling issues hit.

One thing that many people that think about Bitcoin are **still** missing is that the transactions in a block are not validated as it comes from a miner. They are instead all validated in the time between blocks.

Applying concepts from (JVM) garbage collection design, you can move utxos that are old to ever more long-lasting storage. Something older than 80 years may be in a collection that only has all the transactions not being spend for 80 years. This collection doesn't hurt the performance of all the newer transactions. It may cause a full second delay on an incoming transaction that is indeed that old, though. But that is Ok because we have parallel validation (at least in http://flowee.org) and there is no time-pressure because it is done in between blocks.

If you hate desktop wallets, try the latest Exodus wallet. It's what all wallets should be. Easy to use, looks so good I want to make love to it. Hugely customizable and stores many currencies. It has an inbuilt exchange. It's not open source though, which shouldn't matter for smaller holdings but once you hit billionaire status, maybe find something more secure :)",1523140052

My mom is a CPA and she literally had a team of her CPA friends looking into how crypto is taxed. They all think the way it is done is ridiculous. Not only that, but I also think it has a lot to do with this dip. People made huge gains in 2017. They’re finding out now they owe taxes regardless of if they converted to fiat or not so they’re having to sell off some of their BTC. It has been going down since January and tax day is coming up.

"Here's my understanding. Numbers are arbitrary. Also, I'm not trying to talk down to you or anything - in fact I'm half trying to understand myself.

Step 1 :
You have 100M$.
Bitcoins are worth 5k$/₿.
You buy bitcoins with your 100M$.
Let's simplify and say that your first 80M$ invested don't move the price, so you get 80M$ / 5k$/₿ = 16k₿.
Then for the last 20M$, bitcoins are 8k$/₿. That's 2.5k₿ more.
You own 18.5k₿. You've invested 100M$. Overall, your bitcoins cost you 5.41k$/₿.

Since the current value of bitcoins is 8k$/₿, you could say that you have 148M$ in bitcoins. 

You could start selling bitcoins and would make 2.59k$/₿ on the first few you'd sell - but the value of bitcoins would shift down like it did on the way up. In the end, you would probably end up with little overall profits.

Step 2 :
Short 2000 bitcoins, aka sell 2k₿ that you don't own at the current market price (8k$/₿). This basically mean that someone is loaning you 2000 bitcoins. For simplicity's sake, we'll assume that the person loaning you the bitcoins is doing it from the goodness of their hearts so no fees are charged.

You've made 16M$, but you still owe your loaner 2k₿. You will have to ""close this position"" (pay back the ₿ loan) at some point in the future. You could give some of your 18.5k₿ to close the position, but then you wouldn't be doing a short. A successful short happens when the price of whatever you've borrowed lowers between the time you borrwed and sold it and the time you close your position.

Step 3 :
Shortly after step 2, sell your 18.5k₿.
Let's make this incredibly contrived and assume you make your 100M$ right back - aka the first 2.5k₿ you sell is bought at 8k$/₿ and the rest at 5k$/₿.

Bitcoins are worth 5k$/₿ at this point. You are already in a great position, but it gets even better. Because bitcoins went from 8k$/₿ to 5k$/₿ very fast, everybody on the internet is losing their shit and saying ""this shit is bombing, get out while you can."" Weak hands sell, and the price of bitcoins falls to 3k$/₿.

Step 4 :
When you feel not many more people will sell and the price is as low as it will get, you close your position. You buy 2k₿ at 3k$/₿ - a 6$M purchase. You give your friendly bitcoin loaner of step 2 these 2k₿, which pays back your loan.

This process has netted you 16M$ - 6M$ = 10M$. Considering you've risked 100M$ in the process, that's a 10% return on investment. That's not bad at all. And can be improved in many ways (you could short more bitcoins at step 2, for one thing).

By the way, if people at step 3 held their bitcoins after the cost fell back to 5k$/₿ and you closed your position at that price, you would still make (16M$ - 10M$ = ) 6M$. Not as good, but nothing to sneeze at either.

Bonus step : Conspiracy! 
Just before step 3, call your whale friends. Agree with them that they don't do THEIR step 1 while you are selling, for that would put you in a bad situation. In fact, get your whale friends to synchronize with you. This effectively makes the cycle more powerful - their money makes the price go higher when it rises, and when they also dump, the price drops lower. This is collusion, and in a regulated market is not allowed. Which is good, because it's then much more risky to attempt these kind of shorts - you could be at step 4 when another whales comes around and fucks everything up.


The only thing I don't understand is how the loaner of bitcoins is not getting fucked. Sure they can charge for the loan, but aren't they losing massive value on their holdings? Why would you accept to loan?",1523138794

"Thanks for the post. Litecoin was my first ""alt""coin, and I thought it was superior to BTC due to the faster block times. Then it became pretty clear that the community was going in the same path as BTC for scaling via LN.

If you extrapolate to the future... If LN perfectly succeeds, block time will be quite irrelevant. Also, dealing with multiple currencies is slightly annoying, so wouldn't people just trend toward one of the two? Odds are against LTC in that case. Thus, it seems that the development path for LTC is *likely irrelevancy if all goes to plan*. Why would someone accept a less commonly used crypto if the transaction method is identical to that of a more commonly used one?",1523136269
"Why do you seem to think that transactions will be done exclusively on LN by merchants and their customers suddenly (""adoption from 0"")? All the merchants currently accepting Bitcoin (through third parties or not) will still be able to use on-chain settlement as long as they find it useful. Merchants which could benefit from supporting LN payments/invoices in addition of direct Bitcoin payments won't be too hard to convince if the benefits of the system outweigh the setup costs.

"Modeling it visually doesn't change anything. Using the correspondent bank network model(bank is a loaded word I know but for the visual): http://corporatecomplianceinsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/image003.png

Envision each correspondent bank as a well connected liquidity providing node instead, At different liquidity levels. So lets say 3 tier system.

Tier 1 - small class(consumer setup), liquidity .1-1 btc, channels 50-500

Tier 2 - medium class (professional setup), liquidity 1 - 100 btc, channels 500 - 5000

Tier 3 - Large Class (Enterprise setup), liquidity 100-10000 btc, channels, 5000+

Assume Consumers will typically connect directly to 2 or more Tier 1 or tier 2 nodes. Also again assume, liquidity providing nodes will have capabilities to maintain local and remote balances sufficiently since balances are monitored locally and can be rebalanced, closed or reopened in near real time(re-opening of course will require on chain tx waiting period). Assume tier 1-3 nodes are well connected not only to consumer wallets but also other liquidity providers so there are several layers of redundancy for routing and re-balancing.  

Incentivizing this model at this point is based on the singular assumption that a tier 1 - 3 node can at the very least cover operational costs of providing the liquidity. That is the bare minimum, most will be seeking profit but I would assume some percentage will be doing it because they can without a profit motive. But for the majority we have prove say 95% of tier 1-3 nodes can break even or better using relay fees only. ",1523135576

"&gt; so there is no way in which you can claim that a majority were in favour of slavery. The abolitionist Republican party even won a general election prior to the commencement of the civil war, so even among white people slavery was falling into disfavour.

Lol. I love this amazing attempt to backtrack into somehow arguing that slavery was not the majority view for thousands or even tens of thousands of years all over the world. True mental gymnastics.

&gt; Moreover, the reality is that not only was chattel slavery deeply immoral it was also economically inefficient, and unsustainable. Innovators and entrepreneurs were finding far more profitable uses for labour than bondage via the industrial revolution. In a market system, workers can specialise in their own talents rather than being directed into a specific channel of labour by their master. So what I am proposing is actually quite comparable to the background of the abolition of chattel slavery.

No, because what you proposed was that what must be adhered to is the will of the majority. Which supported slavery of all kinds for millenia.

&gt; Have you driven around the USA recently? I drove around the USA in 2016 and there are thousands of homeless teeming everywhere, especially in large metropolises such as San Francisco, and Los Angeles. Have you not seen the tent cities?

How about you go and find actual data? There are not millions of homeless in the US. And the homeless that do exist are cared for in some fashion. Most of the problem of homelessness has to do with mental health problems and failures of state-organized care.

&gt; Abolishing a centralised system that the majority of people support is right-wing central planning, and right-wing social engineering

No, no more than abolishing slavery, something that a majority of people supported. A lack of central planning is not central planning. Sorry, you don't get to simply assert your preference as an axiom by accepting contradictions. The fact that people would reject your hubristic planning notions is not an indicator that they, too, are trying to plan society/the economy.

&gt; There is a better alternative, called replacing state-run centralised technologies with decentralised technologies. Bitcoin is at the core of this revolution.

Bitcoin has always been a libertarian, even anarchistic technology, and offers us a way around outdated state structures in the long run (agorism).

&gt; The political process has been a failure for our movement. We need to build decentralised technologies that are better than the systems that we are trying to replace.

That's what I'm talking about: abolishing the state slowly, by making it obsolete, by producing economies and institutions outside its purview that will outcompete it and eventually be adopted voluntarily by the populace when evidenced by its superiority.

"&gt; What I don't get was why was the 1 BTC split to begin with when the transaction only called for 0.01 BTC to be sent?

To understand this you really need to understand how bitcoin works. In bitcoin you send transactions. Transactions have inputs and outputs. 

An input says, send x bitcoins to address ...

An output that hasn't been spent is an unspent transaction output (utxo). A utxo is a coin. Think of gold coins.

When you send a transaction your wallet looks at what coins you have. It collects enough coins that are equal to more more than you want to send. These are the transaction inputs. 

Think of taking gold coins out of your pocket to cover the cost of the transaction. You melt all the coins down and mint 2 new coins - the 1 you want to send and a ""change"" coin. This is basically how transaction inputs and outputs work. ",1523133836

"BTC and ETH are the easiest to cash out in my experience. 

The quickest way (depending on which country you are in and if you have an account) would probably be over to GDAX/Coinbase and direct to your bank. Fees are fairly high and some people hate using it.

Localbitcoins is really good and very active so as long as you price realistically you should be good using that. 

There is Localmonero but it's not very popular yet so not sure how quickly you could sell them.

If you do have to convert to BTC and will need to do this in the future I've found having a Monerujo wallet really helpful as you can send BTC direct from it (it converts it in route for a small fee).

Good luck with it. ",1523133691

""Use SHA256 and 10 minute block times"" is an implementation. ""Retarget difficulty every 2016 blocks based on the hashpower during that difficulty period"" is an implementation.

I suggest you read the whitepaper. It doesn't say anything about the 2016 difficulty period. It just says to retarget it based on hashpower. Big difference. Bitcoin is **defined** by its **definition**, *not* its *implementation*. Change the definition and it is no longer bitcoin.",1523133671

How much of what we learned over our lifetimes from Dino-Media, schooling, various govs etc... have we (at least I) found to be the opposite of the truth??? For me, the vast majority of what I was raised to believe is NOT true! From health... what to eat, who is good/bad (the end-less wars) etc...

And no where have I said paying $60 will allow you to pay zero. There is still a *cost* even when one follows *the law*. The cost is time to educate/learn the truth of what *the law* says and then how to comply.

"Part of the challenge with this question is that it's often layered and wrapped up with other questions, like: 1) What is Bitcoin? 2) Why should I use it? 3) How does it work?

The what and why is actually pretty easy to explain in a succinct manner (see below) but the how is much more complex because it gets into exchanges, wallets, private keys, addresses, blockchain, etc. I've made the mistake of jumping right to the HOW only to see eyes glaze over.

For explaining what it is and answering why you should use it, this is the simplest and truest way I know:

&gt;Bitcoin Cash is a new form of electronic money completely and one hundred percent under your control. It's a faster, cheaper and more secure way to send and receive money outside the control of any government, bank, or institution. To send or receive this new money, all you need is a mobile phone, computer or access to a Bitcoin ATM.

"**Probability**

Probability is the measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. See glossary of probability and statistics. Probability is quantified as a number between 0 and 1, where, loosely speaking, 0 indicates impossibility and 1 indicates certainty. The higher the probability of an event, the more likely it is that the event will occur.

"The Nov/Dec rush, which pushed BTC to its ATH was a matter of people rushing in with hopes of getting rich quick. Many of those people got burned, learned a painful lesson, and won't be back.

BTC prices are on a downward trend, towards zero.  The current BTC prices are what they are  only because some people still imagine, that there will be a greedy rush (and they will get rich) or that BTC will at least recover to the point where they can get out without a loss.   None of that will happen.

The past---i.e. BTC going down and recovering---is not a helpful guide here, because people are now more aware than they were in the past.   There won't be any new money coming into bitcoin; the only people now making money are those involved in ""pump and dump"" schemes in which they fleece ""hodlers"" who mistakenly believe in ""daily cost averaging"".

There won't be any major problems so long as Bitcoin &lt;-&gt; USDT and Bitcoin &lt;-&gt; USD rates remain close.

However, the growth of Tether's marketshare is worrying nonetheless; As Tether cannot be redeemed for USD, this increase in market share is slowly eating away at market liquidity. This will become a problem as mining creates a mostly-static demand for market liquidity.

If Tether keeps eating away at market liquidity, the liquidity will eventually drop to the point where mining continuously pushes the price down.",1523132861

"On this chart, the space between 10000 and 20000 is the same as the space between say 20000 and 30000. On a LOG scale, the distance between say...100 and 1000 is the same as the distance between 1000 and 10000. That makes it much easier to see percent gains because if I bought say 10 BTC when it was worth 100 dollars, if i sold it at 1000 I would have made 1000% gains, whereas if i bought 10 BTC at 1000 and sold it at 10000, then I would have also made 1000% gains. A linear scale is bad for large price ranges like this because if I had bought BTC at 1000 dollars and it dropped to say 100 dollars, I would have lost 90% but the price only dropped 900 dollars, meaning it would appear small on the linear scale.

Craig isn’t a threat to BTC, he’s a pompous windbag with zero credibility. He hasn’t actually contributed anything except noise and empty half-baked pre-announcements. If Blockstream were funding anything it would be his flights and hotels for BCH conferences.

By contrast nChain has every reason to astroturf the community and try to plaster over and prop up his reputation.

"&gt; rejecting connections from peers that don't produce blocks

How _should_ that be interpreted? Do they only accept blocks from peers known to produce them, while still accepting transactions from other nodes? How do they distinguish a non-mining node from a block-producing peer?

To me it seems a dangerous step to only accept blocks from a select set of nodes. In fact, I'm quite put off by the importance placed on the gossip network - or specific announcement side-networks, e.g. FIBRE - within the Bitcoin space at all. Even relying on the internet itself is a form of centralization that has the long-term potential for harm. A wonderful feature of Bitcoin's design is that a block contains all the information needed to validate it against a known chain. No matter where you receive a block from, you can quickly and independently verify the work proof in its header. There is no _need_ for additional entities.",1523130930

"Another fabulous article in [Wendy McElroy's series](https://news.bitcoin.com/the-satoshi-revolution-by-wendy-mcelroy/)!

I recommend reading the whole piece. Below are a few excerpts...

&gt; The boiling frog is a false fable that has a valuable lesson attached. A frog is boiled to death because the temperature of water in the pan where it sits is raised so gradually that it does not notice the lethal process; it does not jump out. The boiling frog is a metaphor for people who blithely tolerate a series of incremental changes until the end result becomes deadly.  The process is also called “creeping normality”; a major shift is accepted as “the norm” because it is introduced in small steps, each of which is sanctioned or, at least, not opposed. The end result may be widely viewed as objectionable—or, rather, it would be if it arrived in a single leap—but it comes inch-by-inch. **The slow erosion of freedom becomes an everyday event.** There is one more blank to fill out on a form; boarding a plane  requires a standardized state-issued card; police stop random cars or pedestrians to demand ID.

&gt; And, to make sure as much data as possible is raked in, government recruits crony corporations—such as central banks—that act as centralized points of data collection. Then government eliminates free-market competitors who do not act as bureaucracies. The loop is closed. Anyone who uses a government service, from schools to social security, must give up their data to do so. Anyone who uses a faux free-market service, from air travel  to banking, must give up their data to do so. What the loop closes around is the individual.

....

&gt; Into the walls of this Brave New World, Satoshi Nakamoto carved an EXIT door for those who want to privatize their own data and to decline the nationalization of their identities. It opens to a path around government, central banks, and crony corporations—a path around trusted third parties—because no one should be trusted with the custody of human rights.

&gt; It is impossible to predict the future of crypto because the future evolves quickly and in unexpected directions. But, wherever it goes, the principles of the Satoshi vision remain true North: individual control of privacy; peer-to-peer exchanges (or as close as possible on exchanges); and, decentralization.

&gt; Privacy is not dead; it is enjoying a revival. Governments know this. That’s why they choke off discussion by claiming privacy no longer exists. Nothing to see here, folks. Move along. Believing authorities means allowing your identity to be nationalized and accepting your fate as a number to be ranked by bureaucrats.

&gt; Or you can take the EXIT.

You, and many others don't seem to recognize how much personalities, and appeals to authority sway your views. I think this is why CSW, and Ver, trigger such a reaction from Core; at some level you base your opinions on authority, and the possibility that a competing authority could undermine your paradigm scares you, it would invalidate you, make you wrong, and that's too much to cope with, so you must tear them down.

"&gt; I find it very unlikely that taxation is what creates ""inherent value"" for fiat currencies. Taxation means there's some need for that particular currency, but no evidence is shared that argues that that need is what drives the value.
&gt; 
&gt; For example, consider the United Arab Emirates. There is no income tax and, until recently, no VAT either. Government spending was done through the money raised for oil. Yet they still had a functioning fiat currency. According to your argument here, this should be impossible.

The writer limits his example to US dollars.  I see no reason to believe that it is necessarily to be extended to any and all currencies.   

Still, let us consider this.   Let us suppose that the US dollar has value for the reasons given by the author.  And according to you tat does not apply to the United Arab Emirates dirham because ""no tax until ... revenue from oil ..."".

Here is a question: what is the (mostly) standard currency for trading in oil?  **What currency have the sheiks been taking for their oil for all these years?  Why?**  What do you think would happen to the UAW currency is USD tanked?

&gt; Your scenario here doesn't really seem to make sense 

As indicated above, I did not write that.  But let me try and take a *guess* at what the author is alluding to: contrary to what bitcoin zealots think, ""limited volume of money"" is ultimately a disaster; and we know that from past ""experiments"".  Indeed, one of the most important jobs of a central bank is to periodically adjust the money supply---increase it or reduce it, as appropriate.   There is for example, the idea that the 2008 economic disaster was ""the result of printing too much money, which is why we need something like bitcoin.  Actually, not quite.  ""Printing"" (or ""quantitative easing"", as the Federal Reserve called it) was actually the solution!

Bitcoin cannot function as, say a national currency, precisely because the volume is limited.   And when the author states that *""if the supply of a currency is limited, and the quantity of goods and services in the economy grows, it follows that the price of those goods and services in that currency must fall""*, my guess is that with a limited volume of money, prices in an expanding economy must literally become smaller---for the very simple reason that there is only so much money to be divided all around.",1523130041

Also, it is worth mentioning that your allocations don't have to be equally split. In your example you said ""equal parts"" which means you chose 25% btc, 25% eos, 25% ada, and 25% neo. You could also choose other allocations, for example 30% btc, 30% eos, 30% ada, and 10% neo.",1523129587

"Here is my thinking, right wrong or indifferent. Not a fan of the alts, as the developer may or may not be developing anything beyond just making more coins. Quite a few of the developers have stated, they just buy McClarens, have no intention of building or making anything beyond the coin. Quite a few developers just pump the speculation of the coin, nothing more. Quite a few of the projects sound stupid. Quite a few of the projects are not now nor ever will be needed, used or gain any adoption. Quite a few of the projects have teams that are previous fraudsters. Quite a few of the projects have dumb uses for the coin. Very few, and maybe not beyond 3 coins have present working projects. The current coins with a working project have no good tie in with the coin beyond speculation of the coin. Quite a few of the projects need recognition and will never get recognition.

You don't understand crypto as well as you think you do.,1523128705

"I don't completely understand how this works. I know I divide my portfolio in equal part for e.g I bought btc, eos, ada, neo, all with 25$ each. How would the rebalance work after their value has changed?",1523128673
"&gt;But that argument misses a crucial point. Fiat currencies do have an inherent value. The US dollar, for example, has value because the US government insists that Americans must pay their taxes in US dollars. And if they fail to pay their taxes, the US government will send them to jail (unless, of course, they are rich enough to employ expensive accountants and lawyers to devise legal tax dodges). That threat creates an underlying demand for US dollars which lends the currency a real value.

I find it very unlikely that taxation is what creates ""inherent value"" for fiat currencies. Taxation means there's some need for that particular currency, but no evidence is shared that argues that that need is what drives the value. 

For example, consider the United Arab Emirates. There is no income tax and, until recently, no VAT either. Government spending was done through the money raised for oil. Yet they still had a functioning fiat currency. According to your argument here, this should be impossible.

The reason this is possible is because currency gets its value from what others are willing to give up to get it. Taxation may create some small amount of demand, but it is not the only source of demand, and is not a necessary component of demand.

&gt;Without similar backing from a government, bitcoin lacks any inherent value. Yet even if it were to win the status of legal tender, bitcoin would still have critical drawbacks. In particular, the very factor that enthusiasts like most about the cryptocurrency – its limited supply – ensures it will never replace conventional currencies as a widely-used form of money. That is because if the supply of a currency is limited, and the quantity of goods and services in the economy grows, it follows that the price of those goods and services in that currency must fall. And if prices are falling, businesspeople become increasingly reluctant to borrow to invest, because they would have to sell ever more stuff to service their debt. But with falling prices, customers defer their purchases, which means selling stuff gets ever harder.

Your scenario here doesn't really seem to make sense - as you said, bitcoin would increase in value as the quantity (and quality) of goods and services for sale grows. If this leads to a high level of deflation that discourages investment broadly speaking, then the quantity and quality of goods and services for sale would no longer 
be growing. The deflation rate should be tied to the productive capacity of the global economy, which means that is should reach some sort of balance - if it's growing really quickly, investment is discouraged, if it's shrinking, investment is encouraged.",1523128655

"""Doublethink lies at the very heart of Hodl, since the essential act of r/Bitcoin is to use conscious deception while retaining the firmness of purpose that goes with complete honesty. To tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them, to forget any fact that has become inconvenient, and then, when it becomes necessary again, to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed, to deny the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality which one denies-- all this is indispensably necessary. Even in using the word *doublethink* it is necessary to exercise *doublethink.* For by using the word one admits that one is tampering with reality; by a fresh act of *doublethink* one erases this knowledge; and so on indefinitely, with the lie always ahead of the truth.""",1523128532

Lots of people have faith that driving the technology forward will bring the price up, and lots of innovation is happening on the LN.  People attempting to drive the price up directly arn't really adding much to Bitcoin's value on the medium-long term...I think the huge runup last quarter of 2017 was driven mostly by short-timers driving the price, which I don't believe will hold a candle to what the medium-long tech-drivers will bring it to in the next five years.

&gt; Bitcoin is the beginning of something great: a currency without a government, something necessary and imperative.

"&gt;The majority of people -- aka society -- at that time believed strongly otherwise.

An absolute majority of the people adversely affected by slavery, i.e. the slaves were not even polled, not counted, so there is no way in which you can claim that a majority were in favour of slavery. The abolitionist Republican party even won a general election prior to the commencement of the civil war, so even *among white people* slavery was falling into disfavour.

Moreover, the reality is that not only was chattel slavery deeply immoral it was also economically inefficient, and unsustainable. Innovators and entrepreneurs were finding far more profitable uses for labour than bondage via the industrial revolution. In a market system, workers can specialise in their own talents rather than being directed into a specific channel of labour by their master. So what I am proposing is actually quite comparable to the background of the abolition of chattel slavery.

&gt;There are not millions of homeless in the United States. And the homeless almost always have shelters and other resources to fall back on if necessary. Furthermore, lack of health insurance is a symptom of a complex problem and not necessarily indicative of ""poverty.""

Have you driven around the USA recently? I drove around the USA in 2016 and there are thousands of homeless teeming everywhere, especially in large metropolises such as San Francisco, and Los Angeles. Have you not seen the tent cities? The USA is very, very far away from abolishing poverty. I believe that decentralised technologies will solve most of these problems by giving the poor tools to lift themselves out of poverty. But there's a very long way to go.

&gt;""Lack of planning is central planning!"" ""War is peace."" ""Ignorance is strength."" Jesus christ, dude, just listen to yourself.

Abolishing a centralised system that the majority of people support is right-wing central planning, and right-wing social engineering. 

There is a better alternative, called replacing state-run centralised technologies with decentralised technologies. Bitcoin is at the core of this revolution.

Seriously, what has done more to challenge the Fed? Political campaigns (e.g. ""End The Fed""), or Bitcoin? The first has been completely impotent, to be honest. Ron Paul (who was a sincere man, sincere about peace, and sincere about sound money) was shuttered out by the Republican establishment, and his supporters were mostly cannibalised by Trump who is a hardcore statist and authoritarian and war hawk.

The political process has been a failure for our movement. We need to build decentralised technologies that are better than the systems that we are trying to replace.",1523126662

"At Particl (PART), we believe the best way to protect your personal data is to not share it in the first place. As you can never fully trust a third-party to not share it without your consent, the only way to be truly certain is to be completely in control of it. This is why we believe areas where our data is the most mined should be decentralized and made trustless.

Our privacy-focused and decentralized marketplace (the first Particl dApp) targets this issue directly by allowing buyers and vendors to retain full control over their personal data and shopping habits. As our platform is made to accept almost any coin through the use of atomic swaps, we would be extremely interested in working together with any other crypto project who share our vision of decentralization, privacy and control over our own personal data. Let's build bridges between different crypto projects and make each others better and more efficient so that we can give the power back to the people. 

In a way, Facebook's debacles is a blessing in disguise as it has been making a lot of waves into the mainstream and is surely going to lead to more people becoming aware of the importance of privacy, security and freedom.

"I touched on that in the yours article.

Basically a UTXO database is just a list of transaction outputs that have not been spend yet. Its about 25 bytes in size at best.

Now, what a node need to validate it is spend by the correct person is to combine it with the original transaction. Which means you need to link to the actual historical transaction. Which Satoshi did in the initial design.

Core wanted to make nodes prunable, which means removing old blocks. And this causes an obvious problem, you can't prune a not yet spend transaction because you need some info from it to validate it being spend later.

Of all the possible solutions core choose the worst kind;  they copied a rather large binary-blob of the original transaction into the UTXO database. There are a large set of negative side-effects of this decision;

* your UTXO gets 50 times as large as it has to be.
* retrieving data get immensely slower
* database-cashing will cause much higher memory load
* Bigger blocks cause more memory (not disk-space) to be used for the database records.
* Huge hindrance to parallel validation.

This are the ones off the top of my head. Its enough, I think.

Incidentally, Core only last year got pointed out a denial-of-service attack based on the misdesign of the UTXO at the 'breaking-bitcoin' conference. They since changed another problem which alleviates the issue.

---

So, re-designing the UTXO can have a huge amount of benefit on both speed and memory-consumption. It will also make a big difference on parallel validation (although Flowee is already down to only 5 hours to validate the entire BCH chain on git-master).",1523126476

"For me, it is Particl (PART), a little known coin that is very ambitious and directly targets real-life utility. For what it is worth, I have been into Bitcoin since 2013 and have seen so many crypto projects come and go. The only one I ever truly wanted to get involved with and contribute actively was Particl because, big personal opinion, it is one of the only coin that ""has it all"" in terms of economics, vision, purpose, privacy and utility. 

Very simplified, Particl is a privacy-focused platform where users can use and build decentralized applications focused on privacy. Almost any coin will be able to be used as soon as they integrate atomic swaps into the wallet (atomic swaps have been enabled since Nov 2017 but not graphically). If you want a crash course on Particl, there is this new Youtube channel where this girl [CryptoCandor](https://youtu.be/DVq3PoLGq9c) has made a more than awesome review of the Particl coin. Note that she is in no way associated with Particl and I thought it was the most in-depth and more important than all unbiased review of this coin. 

**So why is Particl a good fit to your post?**

Particl's first dApp that is just about to be released (the alpha version) is a fully decentralized/trustless privacy-focused marketplace where users will be able to buy, sell and trade any product or services anywhere in the world and do so in a completely anonymous fashion. To illustrate why it is so important, let's think about how Bitcoin decentralized currency, but is still pretty much dependent on its (centralized) infrastructure (for example, exchanges, payment processors, third-party services, etc). Particl aims to decentralize the cryptocurrency infrastructure.

When I think of the ""next logical step in cryptocurrency"", I always think of the eCommerce side of things because to me one of the best use case of Bitcoin is being a currency (and you need somewhere to spend it). While there are a couple of eCommerce/marketplace projects being built, the only one that really stands out to me is Particl because it is the only one that resolves these current problems with eCommerce as it stands today: 

**Privacy**
As we all know, tech giants like Google, Apple, Facebook, but also Ebay and Amazon, make a business of collecting and mining our personal data. This represents a huge risk for the user as not only does that data can totally be willingly abused as we've seen in the case of #DeleteFacebook, but it can also be compromised/hacked like the gigantic Equifax data leak. Let's not forget that these companies also sell that information to third-parties who use that data to build an entire profile associated to your identity. In fact, big data companies know you more than you know yourself.

IMO, for privacy to be truly enhanced, the blockchain has to have native privacy tools enabled by default that preserve its users' privacy. It also needs to be made completely trustless (even escrow), as introducing third-parties always leave the door opened for data mining. For example, escrow agents could log conversations between vendors and buyers, or log the tracking number of a parcel. Also, as tech companies are starting to nail blockchain analysis tools, analyzing marketplaces running on pseudonymous blockchains will become trivial/easy, thus the definitive need to have privacy-focused tools natively built into the blockchain (and preferably, enabled by default).

**Lower costs for vendors**
Giants like Amazon, Ebay, Etsy or Alibaba take a huge cut off each sale or ask for astronomical membership fees (for a more in-depth analysis of their fee structure, you can read my article that I wrote about a year ago about that [here](https://decentralize.today/who-is-going-to-use-particls-decentralized-anonymous-market-and-why-is-it-so-badly-needed-7eb79cc8b9ad) (specifically the ""Much Lower Fees Than Centralized Counterparts"" section).

**Less fees for crypto users**
When you are a full-blown crypto user and want to buy some stuff, you need to cash out back to fiat or use some third-party who will fulfil an order for you. Not only does it add several steps to the purchasing process, but it also adds a considerable amount of fees. 

What is interesting about blockchain marketplaces is that they allow users to purchase and sell items and pay entirely in crypto. This eliminates the superfluous fees and allow people to basically buy or sell anything without ever requiring fiat currencies. 

This is of course awesome for anyone that has an axe to grind with the fiat global system, but it is also a great way for people in countries experiencing hyperinflation (like Venezuela, for example) to opt out of this punitive system and live of the crypto economic system instead. This may seem like a stretch for us people who live comfortably, but for people in countries where the economy is out of control, the ability to opt out of the fiat system is extremely valuable for them. 

**Potential tax optimization**
Now this may be a stretch as well, but there seems to be some countries that don't tax purchases made with cryptocurrencies. Buying stuff directly in cryptocurrency, in those countries, could prove an interesting strategy for people wanting to pay less taxes as they don't need to cash out to fiat anymore (and thus be taxed on that withdrawal). This is of course something that would preferably need to be investigated more but it does open door for that kind of activity, especially if the marketplace has built-in privacy features (like Particl ;) )

**More engaging ecosystem for users**
As we are already aware, coins and blockchains do generate communities around them. These people get very dedicated and want to contribute to the project. This community aspect is something that is missing (or at least, is not as pronounced) to giants like Amazon or Ebay, and I believe that the kind of excitement blockchain projects generate would be highly beneficial to the success of a marketplace. This basically makes the shopping experience much more friendly and, especially if the marketplace has some kind of reward program, incentivizes people to come back to it. 

**Friction-less Shopping**
Sometimes, we forget just how lucky we are to live in comfortable countries where most tech giants do business in. But actually, most countries on Earth are barred from using Ebay, Amazon, Paypal or even banks. Blockchain marketplaces allow every human to be able to partake in the global economy and create links between individuals regardless of the political or economical situation of their country. Particl takes that concept a bit further by basically accepting almost any cryptocurrency. So now not only would you be able to use the Particl marketplace anywhere in the world, but you would also be able to use almost any coin (and yes, all non-PART transactions are automatically transfered into PART through atomic swap so that the marketplace can use PART's RingCT capabilities to maintain its users' privacy, thus generating buy pressure for PART even though the user buys a product using BTC, for example). This is what is deemed as currency-agnosticism and is a great attitude (cooperation between crypto projects rather than crude competition).  

---

So for the reasons mentioned above, I am really a big Particl fan. It is a blockchain project that is building an entire decentralized economy and its first application is a decentralized, private by default marketplace governed by the community and which has absolutely no third-party. It will (it is still in development, Alpha in a few days) accept almost any coin compatible with Atomic Swaps, and is in my opinion the ultimate decentralized marketplace solution being proposed in the cryptocurrency scene right now! 

---

Bonus: A video you would find quite helpful for your article would be this video interview from Tai Zen where Joe Fisher, one of Particl's advisor that has made a career out of inventing products and selling them online, explains in great details why decentralized marketplaces will change the industry. His perspective is very interesting (especially as he explains how Amazon rips off vendors by analyzing their sales data and stealing the best selling ""new"" products) and one that is quite frankly eye-opening (at least it was for me). There are two parts to this interview and you can watch it [here for part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAhZK6AnPLw) and [here for part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlAL3x2HHFY)

its all moot because I don't need to trust those people, I don't need to know who satoshi is.

Just say how many finnies you have or something. Then you could use a different decimal, but you wouldn’t want to use bitcoin as the unit. It would still be bitcoin but you wouldn’t call it that for clarity. Like saying I have 1 penny instead of .01 dollars except even lower. That kind of works, but it takes a real ego maniac to want one currency for the whole world. If that is really what Satoshi wanted then I’m sure he still has millions of bitcoin and is going to use them at some later date because he would be a power hungry maniac.",1523124900
"&gt; im not a native english speaker so maybe i used the word ""feel"" where i'd have used something else to make my position clear

So far, the only thing clear about your position is it's a combination of misinformation and stupidity. You should fix it if you care about the truth, but frankly I get the impression you don't, you've convinced yourself of a counterfactual narrative, and you're sticking to it, no matter what. Your facts and reasoning are flatly incorrect.

&gt; don't get me wrong: i posted in this thread just to explain to OP why people around the globe hate BCH

And as you do, I am correcting your clear mistakes, both to make it clear that A) your reasons for your perception are invalid and B) there are actually no reasons for your position at all. It is based in emotion and stubbornness.

&gt; either you are lying or you are misinformed. i ve seen this with my own eyes so i'm rocksolid sure about this

The definition of ""a block"" was changed during the segwit soft fork. According to the opinions of nodes prior to the activation of segwit, the block does not contain signatures, and because the upgrade was a soft fork rather than a hard fork, their views are as valid as the activated nodes. You may well have seen a block dump in a post segwit activated block showing signatures within what it perceives to be the block, but active nodes prior to that activation do not see those signatures or even acknowledge their existence, and they do not accept the existence of that external piece of the block as ""the block"".

&gt; and i'm sorry but i'd rather support satoshi's vision over jihad's and ver's one

Satoshi's vision was and always has been mining nodes scaling to handle the traffic of the network. End of story.

&gt; https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1790.msg28917#msg28917

Perhaps your English is inadequate to ascertain the fact he is talking about the size of blocks in Bitcoin *relative* to the ledgers of other projects that aren't necessary aiming at the same goals of Bitcoin, like BitDNS ad et al.

It is simply unquestionable that the original intended vision for scale is exactly what BCH is doing, end of story, and there's no ""it was only said in private"" about it, citation provided;

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=532.msg6306#msg6306

The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.

Besides, 10 minutes is too long to verify that payment is good.  It needs to be as fast as swiping a credit card is today.

See the snack machine thread, I outline how a payment processor could verify payments well enough, actually really well (much lower fraud rate than credit cards), in something like 10 seconds or less.  If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry.

It's clear you are heavily invested in this and convinced you're right, but there's no doubt about it, you are flat out wrong.

You called people dumb. Whether you actually meant to or were just trying to come up with a provocative title, that is how people likely took it. You followed that title up with a fairly long post that isn't formatted in a way that will help people skim and get a quick understanding.

This may confirm your opinion that people are dumb and following a stupid strategy if they aren't willing to read your post. Problem is, you don't have prior credibility for people to trust you (as far as I know). If you actually want to help people you have to meet them where they are. Throwing the gauntlet down, like you did, will only cause people to raise their guard and prepare to defend their position. You've got to build credibility before you directly challenge someone's beliefs.

I've personally deleted more posts then I'll ever submit because of this very reason.

So, there are a lot of places you can get work. I'll tell you about the jobs boards, but to get any work you'll probably need published samples, so what you need to do is pitch some websites. That part's pretty fun! Pick a topic you want to write about, write an article with links and maybe some royalty\-free images from pexels, flickr, pixabay, etc, and send it to the editor. Just go to the ""contact us"" section. A lot of sites are even openly advertising that they need writers. Put ""article pitch: \[article title\]"" in the subject line and say something like ""I've been reading the content on your site and I think this might be a good fit"".

Pitch a few sites, publish a few articles. You might even consider having one published for free just to get the byline \(oh, you can also post to Medium or Steemit, that would do the trick for some clients \- better to have it on a news site though\). Honestly, in crypto at the moment, you're probably not going to get more than $0.05 per word for news articles I'm afraid. If you like writing the articles only, stick to that \(success!\). If you want ICO clients \(double or triple the rate per word, maybe more\), hit up jobs boards with your samples.

[Freelancer.com](https://Freelancer.com) is a jobs board with lots of work \- the site takes 10\-15&amp;#37; and lots of clients expect good work for next to nothing, the only reason I'm mentioning it is there are a lot of ICO clients there if you're interested in that specifically.

You can find more ""respectable"" work on Problogger, Bloggingpro, Indeed, and CryptoJobs, and just by googling ""crypto writer wanted"" or ""crypto jobs boards"".

"&gt; Ok, but feelings don't matter,

im not a native english speaker so maybe i used the word ""feel"" where i'd have used something else to make my position clear.
sorry but i m not able to explain myself better in this foreign tongue

&gt; Depending on how you define block, no it isn't

either you are lying or you are misinformed. i ve seen this with my own eyes so i'm rocksolid sure about this

&gt; Your position is based on your feelings

my positions are based on facts and reasoning. hate, anger, and so on are just consequences of facts and reasoning. 

&gt; especially considering you are terrible at discerning fact from fiction.

perhaps you lack knowledge or wisdom or intelligence, thus you don't understand things. i dont know but i really dont care.

don't get me wrong:
i posted in this thread just to explain to OP why people around the globe hate BCH. i have no interest in trying to convince you or explain you stuff. time is the best teacher. much better than me ( btw debating in english would be too hard and time consuming for me)

&gt; you're an ignorant idiot that holds positions based on feelings

thanks for the ""idiot"" but you are flatly wrong. i hold position based on facts. 
and i'm sorry but i'd rather support satoshi's vision over jihad's and ver's one

&gt; for the record and interested lurkers watching this exchange and thinking you have anything approaching an actual point, I just want to make it clear you don't.

for the record i guess i have a rather compellig and strong one. these are satoshi's words:

""while Bitcoin users might get increasingly tyrannical about limiting the size of the chain so it's easy for lots of users and small devices.""

I do realize that Tone is a tool, yes. However his arguments are valid, espcially when it comes to the distribution of STEEM and how it all simply will never fade out working at all. 


____ 




If all of this is not enough to at least make you think twice about investing, then ask yourself this. How long is STEEM around and what *exactly* is their platform good for? Have you looked at it? EOS founder ditched it long ago, what people do they even have left? 


When you check your feed on Steemit, does it compare to the quality you get on Reddit? When the Verge hack occurded, did you find out about it on ""bitcoin"" searches in Steemit, or did you find it in Reddit? 


I checked Steem at the time and found *nothing* mentioning Verge, well 4 hours after original news release. 


You know who's getting money in Steemit? Pakis with sympathy. You know how an article/post gets paid? People WITH Steemit control who gets paid. Right. It's not ""upvote get paid"", it's people will currency, deciding if they like your stuff or not. That's not inherently bad, but if you then take into account that VAST AMOUNTS of Steem are still *with the developers* you will quickly understand that the little bucks they pay off to some articles means nothing at all, because the broad picture is to dumb their shitcoin the next time it moons again.

"**Did india ban cryptos?**

Not technically, no. But all indicators point to the fact that they are going to, so far. The only saving grace so far is the bureaucracy taking its sweet ass time to drag this process. It can go either way. 

Remember: In the past, India tried to ban porn, and resulting backlash immediately made them took back that decision. Similarly, this can change if enough people put pressure on the central bank and the government. 

**How can you buy cryptos?**

You cannot use INR to buy cryptos. But you can probably buy it using USD/EUR. Maybe you could use your international debit/credit card and convert inr to usd/euro?

"$35 is rather low for any real graphic design work...

However, if you just want a (text) explanation, how about this:

When you go on to Amazon, or ebay or any shop online you either need to use a credit card, debit card to pay for whatever you buy. You can't just take a paper dollar bill that's in your wallet and spend it online.

In order to use a credit card or a debit card, you need an account with a credit card company, or at the very least a bank. Whenever you want to buy something with your credit card, a small percentage of that money goes to the bank, and not the person you're paying which means that the merchant needs to make prices a bit higher than they need to be. 

Additionally, the bank keeps a log of all of your transactions. Anything you buy they know about. For example, if you buy medication for an embarrassing condition online, they'll know. Even worse, a bank can decline a transaction, which means a bank can prevent you from sending someone money. They can prevent you from doing business with someone.

Wouldn't it be great if you could just send someone money online, without the banks being involved? Ideally, it would be as simple as handing someone a dollar bill, with no one else's involvement.

That's exactly what you can do with Bitcoin Cash. It's a way of sending and receiving money online without the need for a bank or other third party. There is a fixed fee per transaction with Bitcoin Cash, but this fee is a small fraction of a penny, far, far lower than typical merchant fees on a credit card. 

Bitcoin cash is nothing more, and nothing less than a version of cash that works online. You would use it exactly like paper bills and for the same reasons: It's private, it's simple, and there's no significant fee for using it.

Your tool against them is to just keep buying in this accumulation period. Once a few ""weak hands"" holding tether FOMO back in, this thing is never getting this low again.

Once the next bullrun starts, outside money pours back in and we take off again. We're still very early in adoption.

Look at the 1k to 20k BTC run. We went on a run, had a 80-90% correction and we're still way above 1k BTC. The same thing will happen on the next run. We will take off, we will get massively overbought, we will correct hard, but we'll never be down at 5-8k ever again.

People who stayed in on this pullback got kinda reamed. The same thing will happen to people in Tether who don't FOMO back in soon enough. Imagine if you tethered at 1k BTC. It fell to $500 and you thought it would fall to $300 so you were going to wait for a better floor. That floor never came and at some point, if you didn't ""FOMO"" back in, you got roasted. You would have missed the entire bullrun. Even on this insane pullback, we're still nowhere near 1k BTC. That's what I mean. 

Once the next bull season starts, holding tether is going to feel WORSE than it felt holding on this bear run... because if you are still holding, you haven't lost money until you sell.

"Hi,

I'm the maintainer and dev behind http://FloweeTheHub.org which has an UTXO as well as many other parts.

I did publish some research in this [yours post](https://www.yours.org/content/a-roadmap-for-scaling-bitcoin-cash-b11efae5ef9d) some time ago where I explained my experience with the UTXO implementations we have, and how it indeed doesn't scale linearly and additionally is not possible to use for parallel validation.

The good news is that the limitations are not inherent in the UTXO. (even older writing of mine [here](http://zander.github.io/posts/utxo-growth/)).

The problems with scaling comes for the most part due to the misdesigns that Core contributed to the codebase. Which additionally means we can't really put them into a real database.

I honestly am having a hard time formulating a response to this because its just so obvious to me. We do not have many decentralized exchanges, if it doesn't happen soon the regulators may not be aware of such decentralized exchanges and outlaw them by accident.

"It may be a lower level of auditability in a certain sense but I think that is the nature of the beast.  But lets be careful not to conflate this with the idea of ""breaking the chain of digital signatures"".

If we go back to Peter R's talk ""A segwit coin is not a bitcoin"", the idea that Segwit destroys the chain of digital signatures comes from the fact that in Segwit, the signature does not become part of the transaction hash that is used as an input the next time the coin is spent.  Iow, the transaction is signed, but we can drop the signature, hash the rest of it, and now that's a valid unspent output which will become an input for the next transaction.

Coinjoin and even OWAS doesn't change the Bitcoin property that the signatures are still part of the chain.  

I don't know much mimblewimble but it seems interesting.  I watched a little bit of Andrew's talk.  Seems like it has the same non-interactive coinjoin ability, but it is using its own cryptographic trick of calculating an ellipitic curve point based on excesses, whereas OWAS is using bilinear piarings.  

Also keep in mind that optionality doesn't necessarily change things.  If there is, lets say an 'auditability issue' , you would still have that issue with the blockchain in general even if not everyone was doing those kinds of transactions all the time.

In terms of purchasing power, which is what matters, your current wages drop year to year if they remain nominally the same.  If your wages fall in nominal terms but increase in purchasing power, that is all that matters.  Who cares about the nominal amount?

"**URGENT PUBLIC-SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT: UNDERSTANDING LIMITATIONS OF BITCOIN**

**Borrowed from**: http://www.scmp.com/week-asia/opinion/article/2122500/why-bitcoin-fever-bubble-waiting-burst

The cleverness of the underlying technology doesn’t mean that bitcoin is viable as a form of money. And it certainly doesn’t mean that the legions of punters rushing to buy bitcoin as an investment for the future can be confident of earning superior returns, or indeed any returns at all.

Enthusiasts like bitcoins because their supply is limited. The pace at which bitcoin “miners” can create new units automatically declines over time, with the maximum possible number of bitcoins fixed at 21 million. To converts, that limit means that bitcoins, unlike the fiat currencies issued by the world’s central banks, can never be debased by governments intent on printing as much money as it takes to pay off their debts.

Yet despite their scarcity, bitcoins possess no intrinsic value. Unlike hard commodities – copper, say, or even gold – bitcoins have no utility value. And unlike securities such as bonds or stocks, bitcoins do not carry the promise of a future cash flow that allows investors to put a hard figure on their value today.

Bitcoin enthusiasts argue that much the same can be said for fiat currencies. With interest rates around the world close to zero or even negative, conventional currencies also offer no income streams, and hence carry no real value. They are nothing more than an illusion, a confidence trick perpetrated by cynical governments on their gullible populations.

But that argument misses a crucial point. Fiat currencies do have an inherent value. The US dollar, for example, has value because the US government insists that Americans must pay their taxes in US dollars. And if they fail to pay their taxes, the US government will send them to jail (unless, of course, they are rich enough to employ expensive accountants and lawyers to devise legal tax dodges). That threat creates an underlying demand for US dollars which lends the currency a real value.

Without similar backing from a government, bitcoin lacks any inherent value. Yet even if it were to win the status of legal tender, bitcoin would still have critical drawbacks. In particular, the very factor that enthusiasts like most about the cryptocurrency – its limited supply – ensures it will never replace conventional currencies as a widely-used form of money. That is because if the supply of a currency is limited, and the quantity of goods and services in the economy grows, it follows that the price of those goods and services in that currency must fall. And if prices are falling, businesspeople become increasingly reluctant to borrow to invest, because they would have to sell ever more stuff to service their debt. But with falling prices, customers defer their purchases, which means selling stuff gets ever harder.

In short, the widespread adoption of bitcoin as a means of exchange, unit of account and store of value would depress demand and discourage investment, leading to economic stagnation and a rising real burden of debt. It would be a disaster.

Bitcoin could still have a useful future as a specialist means of exchange for internet transactions. However, no one is currently using it for that purpose. Instead it has become a vehicle purely for momentum-based speculation. But with no intrinsic value to support prices, and with alternative cryptocurrencies springing up by the hundred and threatening to negate the very scarcity that is touted as bitcoin’s chief virtue, the bubble that last week propelled the price of bitcoins to a record high is clearly unsustainable.

That's exactly the point.  Tax laws should be based around the common use of the asset being taxed.

"I understand market cap but I don’t see it as an important indicator. It can mean that the last few trades made have been for stupid sums.

This ability to let investments lie dormant takes away the usefulness for me.

In a large market, these differences would be evened out. If however 50% of bitcoin (guess) lies in cold storage or mt gox or wherever and never sees the light of day, how do you work out supply?

Because there's too much dumb shit like this here.  You expect facebook to wade through 5000 scam ads to see if 1 is legit?  Or would you do the same thing and say, ""lets just ban them all for now.""  

The only thing I agree with, is if the industry matures it will be hard to get that ban lifted.

&gt;I think it was plainly obvious that any tweet asking to be sent 0.5 ETH that would return 5 back was a scam without needing to see evidence of wrong doing.

Going by your own suggestions, they should allow it until they prove its a scam.  How do you know you won't get 5 ETH back, besides common sense?

Ok, but feelings don't matter, and if you think they do, reality is going to give you exactly what you deserve at the end of the day anyway, so your opinion is irrelevant.

&gt; /r/btc is full of ""with segwit signatures are outside the block"" this is a lie.

Depending on how you define block, no it isn't, and since it was a soft fork, that definition of a block is entirely valid.

&gt;  I personally checked so i know that segwit's signatures are inside the block and this is an HARD FACT

Since when do you care about facts? Your position is based on your feelings, you admitted it yourself. That being the case, why muddy the waters with facts, especially considering you are terrible at discerning fact from fiction.

&gt; exactly. every thing satoshi did was for small blocks so a ""private"" email that contradicts all of what satoshi did has non very much credibility, don't you think so?

The comments about the intended configuration for scale not being everyone running a full node and that being silly, like everyone running their own NNTP server, were quite public. Of course, you're an ignorant idiot that holds positions based on feelings, so... largely irrelevant, but, you know, for the record and interested lurkers watching this exchange and thinking you have anything approaching an actual point, I just want to make it clear you don't.

&gt; LN was invented in 2015 and satoshi disappeared in 2010. but LN is by all means an upgraded version of the ""layer 2"" that satoshi envisioned. this leaves me no doubt that LN is the way to go.

Upgrades are supposed to work, if they don't work, and the previous version did, they're not upgrades. They're... well, sabotage, I guess.

That's missing the point, you're changing the argument to something else. You're the one that's deluded or perhaps a government agent trying to stop Bitcoin from progressing and taking over as a global decentralized currency.

Businesses are there to take money from users. Miners have no incentive to play by the rules if they can take advantage of users they can and will. Users running nodes are necessary to balance the power.

If the government shut down legitimate businesses then it would just be miners running nodes which would be very dangerous. Countries like China can block internet ports which stops Bitcoin being run in their country stopping miners. This is dangerous for Bitcoin as a whole if nodes are banned making Bitcoin more centralized.

Since the second half of the 20th century, inscriptions have been found on pottery in a variety of locations in China, such as Banpo near Xi'an, as well as on bone and bone marrows at Hualouzi, Chang'an County near Xi'an. These simple, often geometric, marks have been frequently compared to some of the earliest known Chinese characters appearing on the oracle bones, and some have taken them to mean that the history of Chinese writing extends back over six millennia. However, only isolated instances of these symbols have been found, and they show no indication of representing speech or of the non-pictorial processes that a writing system requires.

People say that maybe Hal was trying to hide his identity. Maybe he'd go with Windows-only C++, indeed, but I don't think a programmer like him would specifically try to forget everything he knows about modernization and modularity and make monolithic UI-only codebase. It just makes no sense.

"Yeah sorry I did poor job at articulating.  I agree with what you said about changing the protocol too much could be what is risky.  I am not sure if this coinjoin/aggregate sig scheme would destroy the chain of signatures or not.  But I have thought a lot about Mimble Wimble before which is a similar aggregate sig scheme.  [Andrew Poelstra has a good video explaining it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHTRlbCaUyM).  In that type of scheme there would essentially be every signature aggregated into a hash, and each block is basically like one giant hash.  

I am thinking with this type of MW scheme it breaks the chain of sigs, and the ledger is auditable in that the hash audits the chain, but I think its a lower level of auditability compared to being able to see every signature and the chain of sigs.  I think being able to see a complete picture of the ledger is a more secure way to audit, and can make better sure no trickery went on or hack on the system.

An example of this is on Monero which also does not have a fully auditable blockchain.  There was [even a bug that allowed infinite coin creation](https://www.ccn.com/cryptonote-currency-bug-allowed-creation-unlimited-number-coins/).  Although this was detected you could imagine if it had gone secret for longer, or if other bugs existed and the public would not know.  Whereas with a public auditable ledger like Bitcoin originally designed, if the ledger were hacked in such a way it would be known globally.'

I still think I didn't do a great job at articulating, but maybe you can start to see what I am getting at and have some input on what you think, and how your suggestion would alter the protocol and the auditability of the ledger compared to a system like MW aggregate signatures.
I am curious how your suggestion would compare to that type scheme and if the chain of sigs would be in tact.",1523112577

Congrats! Why BCH and not BTC?,1523112381
"Why Nick Szabo is unlikely to be Satoshi Nakamoto:

1. Nick has very academic writing style influenced heavily by law jargon. Satoshi is nothing like that. I'm sure people analyzed writing styles using special software and found it doesn't match, otherwise Nick would already be exposed.
2. Actual content and ideas are significantly different too: Nick tried to align his idea with legal tradition, Satoshi made no such attempts whatsoever. It seems Satoshi was more influenced with p2p networking ideas.
4. No evidence Nick is particularly good at writing code. Few code snippets he published are nothing like Bitcoin code.
5. Szabo's smart contract ideas are, again, heavily influenced by legal stuff and do not really look like code. Satoshi's Bitcoin script (which can be used to implement certain smart contracts) is a Forth-influenced VM, which is very pragmatic from programming perspective. Satoshi made no attempt whatsoever to accommodate Szabo's smart contract ideas. (Which would be weird since he spent considerable effort on VM.)
5. ""Bit gold"" is too similar to ""Bitcoin"". If Szabo tried to hide his identity he could have found more different name.
6. Nick re-posted his 2005 article in 2008. He didn't change dates, he made another post. I guess he wanted to get more feedback or find people who can help with implementation. Again, it would make no sense to re-post old post with flawed ideas if he was really working on Bitcoin at that time.
9. Finally: Nick is unlikely to be Satoshi because Wei Dai says so.

Wei Dai is cryptographer who came up with proposal of PoW-based digital cash called [b-money](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/B-money) back in 1997. So among Hal Finney, Nick Szabo and Wei Dai, Wei Dai has the priority.

Apparently Satoshi was aware of b-money and sent Dai a draft of the paper for review and feedback.

As you can read [here](https://www.gwern.net/docs/bitcoin/2008-nakamoto), Wei Dai has an opinion that Satoshi Nakamoto isn't Nick Szabo. Specifically he listed three reasons:

1. in Satoshi’s early emails to me he was apparently unaware of Nick Szabo’s ideas and talks about how ""bitcoin expands on your ideas into a complete working system and it achieves nearly all the goals you set out to solve in your b-money paper"". I can’t see why, if Nick was Satoshi, he would say things like that to me in private. 
2. Nick isn’t known for being a C++ programmer.
3. Satoshi’s writings just don’t read like Nick’s to me.

So I assume Wei Dai knows Nick Szabo quite well and thus he can tell if the guy he was exchanging emails with is Nick or not.

"It's hard to put a timeline on full scale Bitcoin adoption imo because you are talking about fundamentally changing people's beliefs on what 'money' is.

The thing is... people are extremely, extremely emotional about money.  Money, religion and romantic partners are probably the three things in life that most often cause people to absolutely lose their shit.

Throw a lifelong viewpoint of let's say 50 years of believing something is a certain way, and it's easy to dismiss.  Which is why the young people I converse with have a much easier time accepting that Bitcoin is money and the older crowd likes to often claim scam, fake, play money, etc.

I have no idea what full scale adoption looks like but I'm thinking 20-30 years after inception at this point simply because it's going to take an entirely new crowd/youthful people that haven't been programmed their entire life to believe that pieces of paper are more valuable than a resource with Bitcoin's properties.  Hopefully I'm wrong and it's sooner... but I see it taking another 10 years minimum.

Tai is an honest guy after timeless truth and selling education as a service.  I'd take the class again because it would prevent me from investing in bitcoin at the peak euphoria.  After China and India start cracking down on miners and making bitcoin ownership and transfers illegal (this is happening literally now), then bitcoin is going to have a decade of hard times.  It will survive, but it needs at least one sovereign as advocate, and it has none.

All the hate on this thread is wayyyyyy oversold.  His courses are long winded, but they give you the real scoop and the reason everyone is mad is that his Erudite analysis basically says don't buy, because 2018 is mountain-peak bitcoin.  The next decade is flat and down.

We have seen even 50% corrections and immediately bounced back in the recent past. Now how do you expect an avg joe to realise market will lose 80% unless we are already down by 70-75% ?

It is easy to say in the hindsight that selling after 50% loss would’ve been wise, but imagine how hard it will be for someone to sell at 50% loss when you are not sure if we are going further down? It’s not easy, hell its extremely painful for majority. You know what’s easy for majority of people to do? HODL - thats easy, you dont have to break your head understanding TA (you will not get good at TA unless you do it for many many months) and you dont have to worry about selling at the bottom because it can bounce back anytime.

was thinking the same thing.

You have two choices with bitcoin. Either you keep it on a server somewhere, in which case if that server gets hacked then you lose your money PERMANENTLY. This is a huge downgrade on fiat where that money can be compensated to you. 

Or you can have a hardware wallet. I am not sure I would want to keep $10k+ in my house though. That seems even less of a good idea, as again this can be stolen permanently. 

There is a reason we moved from using gold to buy things, to cash to buy things and now to credit cards to buy things. We have reached a much less risky and more convenient way to buy things. Adopting crypto would take us back as it is less convenient and more risky.",1523110331

"OK, so I'll probably get downvoted into oblivion for this, but...

I own both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, thank you fork.  I've traded away half of the Bitcoin Cash and almost traded away the rest on multiple occasions even though I know the biggest argument this forum makes (Bitcoin Cash is closer to the whitepaper) is completely true.  Why?

I know how Open Source Development happens and the consensus required to change a project.  The Bitcoin Cash people had a legit argument, but failed to achieve consensus on raising the block size because the Core argument had some legitimate points as well.  But, rather, than just forking and taking a new label, a whole lot of time and energy is spent trying to pry the name Bitcoin from the github project that is actually Bitcoin.  To anyone on the outside looking in this comes off as very weak.  Rather than hear about what is better about Bitcoin Cash every conversation degrades into an argument about what is the real Bitcoin and, to anyone technical, the current Github repository for Bitcoin wins.  Keep in mind, this is coming from someone who owns a, not insignificant amount of, Bitcoin Cash.

This is further compounded by Roger.  It doesn't do any favors for Bitcoin Cash that the primary spokesman in the western world has zero ability to talk technical and has many quotes in his past that come off as whining about Devs not listening to him.  I've been working in the technology field for 20 years, anyone that tells me to listen to them about a particular technology that can't actually get into the nuts and bolts technical aspects is someone I will instantly tune out.

To bring this to a personal level, I always tell people to own their flaws so no one can ever use them against you.  The Bitcoin Cash community does the exact opposite of this and it screams weakness and insecurity to most people.  The day Bitcoin Cash proudly takes up the label of BCash (the altcoin fork of bitcoin to prevent centralization of layer 2) and starts making all of their arguments about why they are more decentralized and secure than the original bitcoin is the day I stop thinking about selling and start thinking about buying.  

I still hold some and want it to succeed, so I felt compelled to write this.

The same thing will apply to any crypto that actually delivers but isn't allowed to advertise but competitors in the same area not using crypto to do the same thing but less effectively can.",1523110192
"&gt;In fact, more than 50% of all countries in the world have less than 6 mln citizens, and most of them have their own currencies.

&gt;It means, the typical national currency has only a few millions of active users (1-2 orders of magnitude less than Bitcoin), and the daily number of their transactions are of the same order of magnitude as Bitcoin.

The average person is making 1-2 transactions per day in cash and cards. A typical national currency with only a few million active users is having millions of transactions per day.

If you're claiming Bitcoin has 10s-100 million ""active users"", but only results in less than 200k daily transactions, then that's not in the same order of magnitude as normal currencies.

The way you're counting adoption, a guy who got sent 100 satoshi from a reddit tip bot 6 years ago and has never used it, and someone who uses dollars twice a day, are both counted as one user of each currency. That's obviously not an accurate measure of adoption because it treats someone who uses bitcoin for 1 in 10,000 transactions as an equal adopter to someone who users it for 100% of transactions.

&gt;99.9% of all stores in the world don't accept the Pakistani rupee

It's accepted 100% of stores in Pakistan, which is what matters. 

A currency that's accepted by 1 store in 1000 in every nation in the world is not as useful as a currency that is accepted in 100% of stores in a single nation and 0 stores anywhere else

In stocks, it does have more of a valuation basis in buybacks, dividends, and a much more distinct consumer and production infrastructure. In crypto, the foundation is still more shaky. 

In the future, we expect this to change. Most of the current coins predictively will fade off. The ones that will survive or prosper will have coin security, network effect, an entrenched ecosystem of merchants and users, a clear revenue stream (such as proof-of-stake coin with increasing traffic), etc. As useful dapps and smart contracts proliferate, the limited fuel to pay for that will also impact coin value.

There were several competing technologies in both these spaces, or as you already got explained to you, in the internet itself. In the end one came out on top and became the reference.

i like small blocks
i like segwit
i like LN
i like core developers

BCH opposes the things i like thus is my enemy

/r/btc is full of ""with segwit signatures are outside the block"" this is a lie.
I personally checked so i know that segwit's signatures are inside the block and this is an HARD FACT

this convinced me beyond any reasonable doubt that BCH is evil

&gt; That's a Roger Ver fabrication or something, right?

exactly. every thing satoshi did was for small blocks so a ""private"" email that contradicts all of what satoshi did has non very much credibility, don't you think so? 

&gt; Also, I notice you falsely conflating ""2 layers"" with ""the implementation of lightning via segwit""

You can screw yourself in taxes with crypto by holding and not immediately creating 2-3 new taxable events to get back to USD.

"&gt; In summary the only effect SM has is wasting other miners time?

It is  only profitable after the next difficulty update.  Since the HM waste proportionally more resources than the SM, the SM makes a small profit after the update if he keeps running his attack.  Maybe there is also an earlier effect  on the price if the competing miners sell fewer bitcoins.  However it is more likely that the bitcoin price plummets when the selfish mining attack gets publicly known.

Whether this attack is feasible in practice is a different question.  If the SM was a pool with 35 % hashpower,  after the difficulty update it would probably be a pool with much less hashpower, because the miners have abandoned it when the attack became known by the public.  If the SM has invested in mining hardware itself, it risks to lose his investment, since there would be discussion about a POW change, if no simpler solution would be found to protect against selfish mining (e.g. don't accept blocks where the first seen time and the time-stamp differ by more than a minute).

But this doesn't change the fact that the paper by Eyal and Sirer is mathematically sound.

"&gt;Ethereum has smart contracts. 

For the record: so does Bitcoin. Every Bitcoin transaction *is* a smart contract, in fact.

&gt;I think Satoshi always wanted more than one bitcoin.

No, he was very clear about this, and said the exact opposite. Though he *did* support other blockchains experimenting and trying to do things other than what Bitcoin does, and discussed how cross-chain atomic swaps can be used to securely trade across blockchains if they end up being useful and valuable.

&gt;Who would want people to go around talking about 0.00053 of a coin for all time. The number is just too low.

Satoshi addressed this directly by saying: [If there's massive deflation in the future, the software could show more decimal places. If it gets tiresome working with small numbers, we could change where the display shows the decimal point.  Same amount of money, just different convention for where the "",""'s and "".""'s go.  e.g. moving the decimal place 3 places would mean if you had 1.00000 before, now it shows it as 1,000.00.](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=44.msg267#msg267)",1523107734
"I've long felt that this sub's vendetta against TRX is way overblown. 

It seems that the hate was originally born of crab mentality (the thing went freaking 150x in the span of a month, after all... a crypto doesn't do that without attracting significant dislike) which is not uncommon for a coin that's just had a huge run up, but the whole thing just snowballed way out of control to the point where it became popular to hate it around here and most people didn't even know why. The whole thing has been a pretty interesting psychological phenomenon to observe.

Yes it has an overly enthusiastic founder who loves to spend his time on Twitter hyping it with pre-announcements, and yes there were some questionable things going on like sections of the whitepaper being copied, but the way people were talking about it in January, you'd think Justin Sun had just performed an exit scam and was in the process of fleeing his country.

Now did he really mean to say: ""the effect of attempting a sybil network will have a negative impact on the selfish miners because it acts as an insulating layer, affecting how fast they hear about blocks"". ? 

Maybe he meant that. I don't know.

Other issues with his talk:

He ranted on a bit about ""near complete network"" without providing any evidence. I mean at least describe how you gathered the data a bit. 

He also made some comments about LN, and those comments would have been fine if he didn't deviate into techno babble about np-hard problems and solving the discrete log problem. He showed a graph and appeared to simulate tx propagation across the LN network, without saying how that was gathered or what the actual time was (was it supposed to be real-time simulation?). I couldn't see the entire slide in the video but he didn't speak of the details. 

Tx propagation speed in LN could be a legitimate issue but only when comparing it to something like 0-conf , bip70 type transactions in Bitcoin Cash (which he touched on but not as it relates to that LN picture). That is probably where he intends to go with this. 

He talked about how we don't need to run nodes as users. This in many cases is true, specifically as he brought up when spending coins. You don't care if that tx confirms. But the merchant does. So wouldn't the merchant want to run a full node? He dodges that.

"I've been watching ontology. I'm afraid to jump in because it has the look of a massive pnd. No working product, just launching testnet, and massive sudden gains in a bear market. It's either a big pump and dump or it's getting the cardano treatment. I'm not sure yet. I'm hoping it's a quality project for 2 reasons. 1 - crypto needs all the strong players with quality projects it can get to succeed. 2 - i want to see investors around the world making money rather than losing it.   

Careful though... ontology's rise seems rather sudden and it's hard to believe it's worth more than some projects out there that it's currently blowing by. Icon is a coin I'm familiar with, for example. Icon has a working product with universities, financial institutions, hospitals, etc and is signing mou's with the S Korean government. S Korea has clearly moved towards the widespread implementation of utilizing crypto. Is ontology and their brand new testnet more valuable than icx?  Icx is just one example here.

"&gt; You do realize that mining pooling allows miners to mine a block without having most of the contents themselves, right?

I do realise that, but a 30% mining pool involves enough people to still have a leak risk. At least when there is a bounty/incentive for someone to leak it. So unless we are speaking of a big mining operation in syberia that alone holds 33%+ then, yes the risk of leaks/hacks is non negligible. Moreover, other things the article doesn't consider is the ultimate effect of Selfish mining on coin price. As I said, bitcoin is already volatile on its own, what kind of miner would add even more to that uncertainty by launching an SM attack that could destroy the price? This is also important because when someone selfish mines everybody knows. How does the selfish miner know that the price won't collapse and why would he selfish mine in the first place then?

The bottom line is **in the SM article none of the defensive HM strategies were discussed**. 

&gt;I strongly disapprove of all that stuff. Theymos should be ashamed to call himself a cypherpunk, and I fault the bitcoin core community for not doing more to ostracize him.

You know very well the funding for such campaigns comes from Blockstream, Samson Mow is CSO of Blockstream. Any person representing Blockstream is a fraud by definition.

&gt;To be clear, he is mis-educating. That's a negative-value contribution.

He is educating people on the economy of bitcoin, its network topology and the importance of user experience.

&gt;You and he are both misusing terms. Gamma is an input to the model, not an output. Craig himself then tried to clarify that by negative gamma he meant negative probability. Well, let's look at what negative probability is. If you read one of the linked papers, it becomes very clear that negative probability is a mathematical abstraction that can be used in cases where there is the possibility of anti-events:

We saw the video, in the conference you were at he said:

&gt;you have negative gamma..the more sybils you put out there the slower your selfish miner becomes.

If gamma with sybils is lower than gamma without sybils then you can say sybils have negative gamma. I have heard this all the time by doctors discussing protection factors in medicine.

&gt;In our case, gamma was the probability that the attacker's block comes in first, as opposed to the honest miner's block coming in first. What does an anti-event in this context even mean? An attacker's block not getting in, and also somehow magically transmuting itself into a second honest block, so as to make the honest chain instantly grow by 2?

An anti event means that without sybils out of 1000 attempts, the attackers block gets mined first 10 times. With sybils, every 1000 attempts, attackers' block gets mined first only 5 times. Therefore we can say that gamma is -0.005%. 

&gt;The article seeks to rescue Craig's claim by turning it into an argument that introducing zero-power nodes has a negative effect on gamma, but that's not even aligned with Craig's own effort to rescue his own claim.

It should be clear to you by now that Craig doesn't have to explain anything. Again I'm shocked that you called someone a fraud for saying sybils have negative gamma. ",1523105220
"Are you lying on purpose or are you just to lazy to play back the interview?

The vehicle routing problem (VRP) is a combinatorial optimization and integer programming problem which asks ""What is the optimal set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to traverse in order to deliver to a given set of customers?"". It generalises the well-known travelling salesman problem (TSP). It first appeared in a paper by George Dantzig and John Ramser in 1959, in which first algorithmic approach was written and was applied to petrol deliveries. Often, the context is that of delivering goods located at a central depot to customers who have placed orders for such goods.

"As you should. Some people will stay with him and hopefully he can retain his integrity to the community. 

People really shouldn't make it too easy for these people to just do these things. What he did was highly unethical and to what extend he did it is also very questionable. 


What is also questionable is his current content. Just watch the 5-6 recent videos of him. He's pushing *his* shitcoins in every one of them. 



I do value his content and what he does for the sphere, but he has to show over time that he really deserves any trust whatsoever. 


Also, Suppoman is not dead yet, despite being a known scammer. The sphere really is full of shitters and my advice to *anyone* is trust *noone* but *yourself*. Datadash has an agenda, Verge has an agenda, everyone has an agenda. If you're unsure about an Altcoin, don't invest. 



Not hating here, he *does* say that people should do their own due dilligence, but I think deep in his heart he knows, nobody or most of his viewers are not doing that. They watch his videos and take his word. That's the sad truth. 



_____ 


To give props where props are due. Datadash leaked himself. It wasn't discovered or anything, he came clear out of his own will, which is good. 



And also, you can't give him shit for talking about Verge. He talks about *many* Altcoins on his channel, infact I'd argue that's what the entire channel is about, more so than overall Cryptonews, it's Altcoin information channel. At one point eventually you will get a scammy coin in there aswell. You may have done a shitty analysis that day. 


Either way in my books he *is* safe. He does say it every single time. Do your own research. If people ignore that advice, then they're the only ones to blame if they lose their money. Also the guy is just really nice to listen to. He's not overly technical, he's a previous trader and that's it. 




Crypto *is* the wild wild west. You have your own gun, don't ask for other people's gun is my advice to anyone really.

"again i must qualify that I'm not overly informed on the ins and outs of the situation, but as far as I'm aware they will not be reverting to an earlier block.

in layman's terms, a hard fork just means you're changing something about the code that isn't backwards compatible, it doesnt mean rolling back. (as opposed to a soft fork, which *is* backwards compatible meaning you dont have to upgrade your wallet etc).

So no, as far as im aware, the coins that were fraudulently mined will not be disregarded. 

if they *did* roll back, it wouldnt just cancel out all the coins that were mined, it would also cancel out all the transactions that happened on the chain after the point you rolled back to. think of what a disruption this would be to exchanges etc who have bought/sold verge for real money since that time.

there are a lot of very informed people who have and are saying not very favourable things about verge. the fact that an attack of this nature can happen is a bit of an indictment of the dev team. we must remember that this wasnt just some wallet or exchange hack that you read about where some incompetent boob had their private keys stolen, its the *xvg blockchain itself*.

See its nonsense like that that makes it impossible to take you seriously.

And that's not enough for the foreseeable future? 5x on chain plus layers above should be more than enough for the foreseeable future. And while you're moaning that bitcoin can't scale, the real software engineers will be making bitcoin scale. 

&gt; The problem with the Lightning Network is that decentralized routing needs every node to broadcast the change in liquidity in a channel to the rest of the network

So which is it? Lightning is a centralised hub and spoke system, or lightning is decentralised? Pick one. 

&gt; Which solution will scale better again?

We'll find out for sure. But I'll pick a coin that isn't trying to market itself as another coin, but rather trying to succeed on its merits, every day of the week. I'll jump to Monero or lightcoin or doge before I use bcash. ",1523104275

"No transactions got hacked.  No coin holders lost money.  It was an exploit in some old code relating only to the mining of coins.  and it was some pro-group of Iranian hackers apparently called (IDC-Team) who may have hacked HBO for an attempted 6 million a few years ago (not like it was some kid in a basement or something.)  Anyway..with the price going up on the announcement I guess they figured now would be a good time to use whatever exploit they were sitting on.  It allowed them to pretty much just keep pumping out the mining bonus on new coins every 30 seconds..instead of legit miners getting it.  and it only was about 1% of total supply.   99% of supply not effected.    So no user transactions were hacked.   Everyone's coins are safe, and HBO is clearly out of business...(don't listen to all the FUD)  and the coin is going up..because what some of these people cannot comprehend on here...it has a broad appeal to many common users who might not be sitting on this thread (and new users cannot even post on here, as under 100 karma can't post..and they downvote most people who like Verge..so..how many will even have over 100 karma...not a lot...its a feedback loop of stupid in here ...as 90% of the rest of the world does not care what fancy tech or great ""team"" some coin has that they back...the world does not care.)

This is what IBM must have felt like..when they figured out a dude in a garage had beaten them...it is desperation ..they even come into our Verge thread and down vote innocuous posts from Verge fans...and if they were smart they would realize they could just siphon some of those Verge fans in a year or so if they think their coins will be so much better..once those people adopt crypto.  Instead they bash newbies and don't even let them post on here for the most part...and wonder why there is almost no adoption in crypto and prices are down lol....Verge's price is up....

The jealousy is rampant and comes out as nonstop desperate FUD...this is in no way good for crypto...let people join a coin and if it has problems..then they have ADOPTED crypto..and then they MIGHT USE YOUR COIN LATER ON.

"&gt; Nice mental and verbal gymnastics there.

You tell me.

&gt; Because they are all centrally controlled shit coins. It's not competence, or lack thereof. It's intrinsic to bitcoin that network forking upgrades are hard. And that network breaking upgrades to the centrally controlled shitcoins are doable shows that they are centrally controlled shitcoins.

Insults but no substance. BTW, given that Bitcoin Core has only one development team, we can qualify it as centralized, lol.

&gt; Bring on schnorr and whatever else comes next. 

All optimizations together in the pipeline will only bring max 5x more transaction capacity on-chain. In other words, not much more than BCH already does today.

&gt; Kind of like the centralised spv network Rogers starving babies will have to rely upon because they will never be able to run their own node?

SPV is in Satoshi's roadmap. BTC and BCH are already centralized around a few dominating mining pools. What you really want is geographically distributed data centers. You won't be able to scale BTC or BCH to world-wide adoption if everybody is required to run a full node on his phone, at least for some time to come.

&gt; And yet you think bcash can scale in a decentralised way? Centralised with multi gigabyte blocks and gigabit networks? FFS, I live in a first world country and I can't run a full node any more due to the bandwidth required. Good luck with that.

The problem with the Lightning Network is that decentralized routing needs every node to broadcast the change in liquidity in a channel to the rest of the network. So for one payment through multiple nodes, you have multiple broadcasts. In other words, the bandwidth requirements are liquiely several times bigger than the broadcast of on-chain transactions.

Blocks on the other hands can be optimized, as the nodes already have most of the transactions of a future block in the mempool. So a protocol update could be to just broadcast the ids of transactions that are included in a block, and not the whole block. This could reduce the size of blocks a lot.

Which solution will scale better again?",1523102756
"&gt; Create an app that allows me (or my staff) to enter the fiat amount I wish to charge. The app will then create a QR code that my customer can scan with his wallet. The QR Code will contain my receive address and the amount of the payment. The customer makes the payment and my app alerts me when the transaction is seen on the blockchain.

2. Managing the cash balance in two units. That is either converting immediately to your unit of account, or manage it with trading futures, or just keeping the bitcoin cash and taking the risk/opportunity with the rates.

So there are going to be a lot of people doing their taxes next week and paying for the 2017 crypto gain.  Given that people presumably made crypto money on 2017 but are at a loss in 2018, I suspect that a lot of people have to sell their current crypto to pay for the 2017 tax.

"&gt;The world’s first global deflationary currency

Gold was a global deflationary currency. Or rather it had long deflationary periods. No currency is inherently inflationary or deflationary. It's relative to the supply and demand of currency.

&gt;You may lie awake at night fearful of a future where people starving to death as they hold off buying food until next year when they can buy five or even ten percent more.

Or people just [resort to barter](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DsKk-VyTkIE/maxresdefault.jpg) and save deflationary money instead.

&gt;When Bitcoin destroys the fiat currency, it kills the root on which the menacing tree of government grows. Without control of the money supply, governments will be limited to smaller less threatening trees that are constrained by economics and market forces

Yes, there's no way government can just increase taxes to the equivalent of what they'd lose by not owning the money supply. They've only managed to seize 1 million out of 16 million bitcoins in existence despite only seizing bitcoins in relation to other crimes. They'd definitely not be able to do anything if they decided to ban bitcoin.",1523099747

"&gt; Governments don't need to make something a currency so long as they haven't made it illegal to use other currencies.

I absolutely agree with it. But it's also possible that some gov will officially adopt Bitcoin before it become a de facto currency in the country. 

&gt; If you go by actual number of transactions its one of the smallest in the world

There is a popular misconception about the size of the average/median national currency, especially in the developed countries with hundreds of millions of citizens (like the US).

In fact, more than 50% of all countries in the world have less than 6 mln citizens, and most of them have their own currencies. 

It means, the typical national currency has only a few millions of active users (1-2 orders of magnitude less than Bitcoin), and the daily number of their transactions are of the same order of magnitude as Bitcoin. 

&gt;  There are less than 200k daily transactions and most of them aren't actually using it as a currency they're just speculators and exchanges moving bitcoins around for fiat. 

You can say the same thing about any currency: the wast majority of all transactions are made by speculators (think high frequency trading on Forex etc).  

&gt; It's a fantasy to think bitcoin is one of the most popular currencies in the world yet 99.9% of stores in the world don't accept it

99.9% of all stores in the world don't accept the Pakistani rupee, in spite of the fact that it's the 6th most popular currency by the number of users.

Because they are all centrally controlled shit coins. It's not competence, or lack thereof. It's intrinsic to bitcoin that network forking upgrades are hard. And that network breaking upgrades to the centrally controlled shitcoins are doable shows that they are centrally controlled shitcoins.

"Hi!
First things first. Media blows things out of proportion. 

There is no ban on cryptocurrencies or trading or any blockchain related thing . 

RBI just has mentioned that entities under its purview should not provide services to these companies. This just means that RBI is trying to stifle a way by regulating in the flow of INR to digital asset exchanges. This would be overcome. 

Your crypto, INR are completely safe with us. And we would urge users not to panic sell. 

We are introducing things to ensure users can get better rewards for the cryptos they hold with options like margin trading. Margin trading has been extended to other 12 more digital assets now. Check them out here 

There are definitely ways to resolve this. And we would work on the same. One of them is - 
We are supporting this petition and we urge all of you to spread the word everywhere. We are already at 10,000 + in a day. Sign it here. 

In south Korea after 220K people signed a petition and there was massive momentum and the South Korean govt overturned the decision to ban crypto. 

We applaud the steps taken by other exchanges and would give full support to fostering a dialogue with RBI and concerned regulators on this. 

We as a crypto community need to stay strong and together in this. We have been the early adopters of this revolution. We need to educate and explain constantly to regulators, negative proponents on how being associated with blockchain has impacted you. Once we do this constantly and enough times we would win. There have been instances like this like SavetheInternet - Where TRAI tried to stifle net neutrality in India. In the end the users won. But it was not until the voice was raised multiple times everyday in different forms by hundreds of thousands of supporters. So tag official twitter handles of RBI, finance ministry, the prime minister and make your voice heard. Send them emails here. Go to their office. Constantly remind them. 

We are here for the long-term. We would continue no matter what till we establish India at the forefront of blockchain revolution. This we just see as a minor blip in the long road ahead. We love the fanatic users who are going strong. We would win this. Let's stay strong.

"Hi Vitalik, I have a question, if I may, about your comment re: the unimportance of network topology. But first, let me say thanks for dropping into r/btc and taking the time to provide such a clear and thorough explanation. All of us are the better for it, and it's been much appreciated.

If I understand CSW correctly, he wants to suggest that network topology *is* crucial to the profitability of SM. Namely, that if mining nodes form a near-complete graph, then by the time SM ""listener"" nodes detect a new HM block, this block will already have propagated to the entire network, thereby beating the SM broadcast. Hence, in Ittay and Emin's first scenario, where honest nodes nullify the SM's lead by successfully finding a block on the public branch, there will in-fact be no ""toss-up"" as assumed between SM and HM's blocks. Because the SM block always reaches miners second.

*If* the above is true, then it would also seem to undermine the strategy pursued by SM in scenario 2. The paper suggests that once the SM pool has a lead of two blocks, it now publishes one block from its private branch for every block publicly found block. This would lead us back to scenario 1, with the caveat that if SM loses the toss-up, it has another hidden block ready to broadcast. But if, due to network topology, there really is no toss-up between SM and HM blocks, then the SM strategy would only work if the SM pool publishes a longer chain. However, as the paper correctly notes, it would be an abnormality for SM's to have a longer chain, ""[s]ince the selfish pool is a minority, its lead will, with high probability, eventually reduce to a single block."" Hence, by pursuing strategy 2 without a possible fallback to strategy 1, SM pool gambles all its block rewards on the probability of finding two blocks in the time that HMs find 1.

So, my question: Is CSW simply *wrong* about miners forming a near-complete graph? Or is he wrong to assume this network topology would lead to full HM block propagation? Or is there something else wrong with this argument?

Thanks for indulging my long question.",1523097805

Satoshi certainly used 30 plus years of ground work and then as this was coming into focus within the space things will no doubt sound similar and characters today will be linked somehow from their train of thoughts. 

Overall, It all seems too clumsy for someone who spent a lot of time managing this risk knowing what was at stake.

Doing research into the subject is great and all, but show some respect, man. Even if you *did* figure it out, aren't you doing Satoshi a disservice by trying to draw attention to your revelation?

Second, you're almost certainly wrong. Namely, the ""Hal Finney was part of Satoshi"" bit doesn't make any sense.

[As I just wrote, less than a day ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8aaenc/nick_szabo_defined_the_basic_concepts_of/dwxau69/):

&gt;It seems much more likely that Satoshi was a single person than a group effort. It's not clear exactly why so many people assume that Hal was directly involved *as* Nakamoto (especially since he was openly involved from the earliest days *as* himself).

&gt;Hal Finney was a legend and definitely contributed to Bitcoin both philosophically and as an early supporter and user, but bundling him as ""part of Satoshi"" is a bit silly, given the facts that we know.

&gt;The Szabo = Nakamoto theory is pretty darn convincing, though.

To follow this up, see [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8aaenc/nick_szabo_defined_the_basic_concepts_of/dwxen8d/), where I elaborate on why ""Finney collaborated with Szabo"" Is an unnecessary complication to the theory, which makes far less sense than Szabo being Satoshi himself. Really, it just doesn't add up.

"&gt; On the other hand, governments need to be ready to make Bitcoin the national currency (political readiness). Will take a long time.

Governments don't need to make something a currency so long as they haven't made it illegal to use other currencies.

USD became the most popular currency in Zimbabwe long before the government recognized it as an official currency. Them accepting USD as legal tender came only after it had replaced the Zimbabwe dollar. Government recognition was a symptom, not a cause of the USDs popularity in Zimbabwe.

&gt;Bitcoin is already one of the biggest currencies in the world, both by adoption and by the aggregated value.

If you go by actual number of transactions its one of the smallest in the world. There are less than 200k daily transactions and most of them aren't actually using it as a currency they're just speculators and exchanges moving bitcoins around for fiat.

There are single businesses that handle 10x more daily transactions than every bitcoin in the world does.

So now those bagholders have to work out a way of getting even more new adopters, or the scheme will fail and their losses will be fully realized as everyone rushes for the exits.

Bitcoins do not produce anything of value, as say a logging company does (and thus its stock). As Buffett has correctly pointed out, 'Cheques transfer value - are cheques worth a whole lot of money?'.

With Bitcoin you only get out the money you put in. And in order for someone to make a great deal of money (such as the early adopters who already cashed out for Lamborghinis and the like), there must be a great many losers. That Lamborghini requires the deposits of perhaps 1000 people.

"&gt; « digital gold/store of value »?

&gt;Why should I have to? At 5 sat/byte fee per standard tx [...]But please make that case, I have lots of popcorn. 

I agree, I actually think you cannot be digital cash without P2Pecash. (Otherwise you are a Ponzi scheme.. plain and simple)

That’s why I think only BCH has value long term.

(Also you seem to suggest low fees are good.. did you forget last Dec?)

&gt;&amp;gt;Yet it is, leaving that capacity changed the characteristics of Bitcoin.

&gt;Live with the consensus of the Bitcoin network or create a coin of your own where the parameters are to your liking. Oh you did? Great! what are you going to call your alt coin?  

Yes, we just refuse the economics change supported by censorship and manipulation.

I personally think change in economics and incentives should never be done via SF because it give miner too much power.

&gt;&amp;gt;There was no block limit at all.

&gt;And now there is. So what?

So it needed to be raised, it is not rocket science really.

&gt;Core writes software. Implementation is up to the rest of the network participants to implement, or not.  

And if part of a community refuses, they are silenced and attacked.

If the economics change had consequences there would have been no need for censorship.

&gt;But feel free to expound on your distinction between moderation and censorship in the context of multiple media platforms and multiple subs on reddit.  

Moderation based on opinions is censorship.

&gt;BCH fails at even that, by your own standards. ""original"" Bitcoin should have ""no block limit at all"". Using a different different difficulty adjustment and wallet address format just underscores how un-""original"" BCH is. 

Limit will be lifted or removed all together (maybe dynamic blocks), it is done progressively next step is 32MB.

the difficulty algorithm fit well what is written in the white paper. it is actually much closer to the definition as one implemented in BTC.. 

(BTC fail to regulate properly and it produces too much blocks, you can check fork.lol if you don’t believe me)

Regarding address format nothing is said on the white paper about it, even if it did changing an address format has economics/incentives effect so I see no problem with that.

&gt;&amp;gt;This is not soft fork detection.

&gt;If you say so. 

It is a flag to tell the network a soft fork happen, if you know how to build a blockchain that can detect soft fork, you will be very famous.

&gt;By consensus rules it would be Bitcoin, yes. There may or may not be a successful solution to that scenario, if it were to occur. There is no guarantee this experiment called Bitcoin cannot fail. I accept that but so far it has not happened.  

This is why defining bitcoin by consensus is ridiculous, it mean bitcoin has no defined characteristics.

Very much a problem for an economic system.

But I have to say onvenient definition to support radical change of the project... 

&gt;&amp;gt;Segwit just increased block size via SF didn’t you forget already?

&gt;Not the portion allocated to tx data, do you still not comprehend the actual mechanics of this thing you loath so fervently?

Almost like segwit is NOT a block size increase, hahaa..

Change of narrative again?

BTW using extensions block it is trivial to increase the “effective” block size as a SF.. (and a shot load of other parameters)

It is rather ugly but somehow you guys seem to like ugly patch..

&gt;&amp;gt;Easy just hide the data to old nodes, ala segwit.

&gt;The data is not being hidden, the data is still there to validate if your node is upgraded. 

It is hidden to old node.

segwit is basically tricking nodes into following a chain they cannot validate the full set of rules...

You don’t see a problem with that?

The wierd thing is it comes from a community that keep saying running your own node is critical.. yet get upgrade by cheating nodes auditing capabilities?!?
 
&gt;&amp;gt;No misinformation, one fork stick to the original characteristics (BCH)

&gt;Repeating that a million more times will still not make it true. 

Do you deny that?

Do you say that BTC has made no change form the original? (Segwit, 1MB4EVER)

All that exactly fit the bitcoin original experiment?

You would have more credibility if you guys assumed what you did..

&gt;&amp;gt;Easy, I don’t know why you guys are so bitter about it.

&gt;The pro BTC, pro segwit, r/bitcoin community is hardly bitter, 

Intense trolling and arguing in bad faith arguments suggests otherwise.

Just test it yourself, do one cheap post “Roger and Jihan control Bcash” and you get the first page of rbitcoin.

Some have actually used it to ge BCH news out on rbitcoin (just turn it in a bad way use the term “bcash” and you got exposure in 200.000 sub that supposed to block all BCH news..)

&gt;Transaction malleability was a genuine problem, what's wrong with fixing it, especially if doing so eases the creation of very powerful second layer solutions. 

I have no problem with that until you restrict onchain capacity to force second layer usage.

&gt;I suppose your point here is that the ""unproven"" might not work. So what? 

Also no problem If capacity was allowed onchain to let second layer solutions mature.

&gt;the base layer is intact and on chain capacity is greatly improved by segwit, 

I disagree, see weight calculation.

If decentralisation is what matters most why give a massive discount to very large tx? (See the content of this testnet block: https://testnet.smartbit.com.au/block/00000000000016a805a7c5d27c3cc0ecb6d51372e15919dfb49d24bd56ae0a8b)

it favor second layer solutions at the expense of the first layer, I cannot see why. (Though it is great if your company rely on sidechain tx for its business plan)

&gt;there is nothing stopping BTC from adding larger blocks later when needed. 

Then it will it be bitcoin anymore?

&gt;The people who really believe in the BTC project really feel the path we're taking is the best way forward. Did I mention that's the vast majority? 

You have no way of knowing the majority through the use of a censored media.

&gt;Your 1 in 10 clan seems to think you're the smart 10% on the bell curve. However, if you were the bottom 10% Dunning–Kruger wouldn't tell you.

Say the guy that use a censored forum to evaluate the support and consensus around BTC.

That should give you a clue on which side of the curve you are.

&gt;As for the ""compromise"" you (so generously offered), many times... Small blocks are a security setting. I don't want to compromise security on my coin, thanks. 

You say so,

Your security feature has been spammed (according to rbitcoin) for the lst two years.

Look like a weakness to me of spammer can make you Transactions fees skyrocket so trivially.

You are very educated so I am sure you have the LN white paper, chapters forced expiration SPAM attack.

Seems lile your security feature directly endangered LN.

&gt;for Bitcoin to fulfill the destiny we want it to, it will need to withstand the full force of a combined frontal assault by multiple governments, central banks and many other entities at the same time.

So the only way it can remain resilient is by being small?

&gt;The network needs further hardening and it's best defense has always been decentralization. [..]For the sake of decentralization -this primary defense, small blocks are better than big blocks. That's all this is about. 

Interesting, ETH now process much more tx than BTC.. yet it has more nodes.

It is almost like decentralisation is a bit more complicated than just small block.

&gt;Big blocks offer more on-chain capacity, short and mid term, that keeps fees low, which in theory is good for adoption (in practice I'm not impressed). 

Low fees offer more use case, which in turn increases the need for nodes and therefore decentralisation.

&gt;Adoption was a hot topic during 2017 when big block proponents were clutching pearls over alt coins ""gaining"" on BTC. Don't make the mistake of thinking small blockers are fools, or like high fees or don't care about adoption speed, we think those are secondary issues. 

Funny how thing are so simple in small blocker mindset. Small block equal more decentralisation.

Then why not going to 300kb as luke-jr suggested?

Good luck being a small miner with high fees, do you know what are their profit margin? High fees kill small miner because they have to mine much longer to be able to afford the payout fee. 

Small blocks are very good for large miner, it kills the small competition (AKA decentralisation)

&gt;We simply do not compromise on security, and because of that there is no 'good enough' when it comes to decentralization. We like your ideas, but we have our priorities.   

No compromise? So why no 300kb block now? Why weight discount for large tx?

&gt;The ""original"" Bitcoin, V0.1 was *broken*, no? **That's why it was not released as V1.0** As a mater of fact, how[...] find most people here disengage as soon as logic and facts hit the fan.    

Segwit and 1MB4EVER was supposed to fix fundamentals flaw of bitcoin?

I am not talking of a specific version, I am talking about the “bitcoin cannot scale” argument.

The original was flawed and lead to security flaw, don’t you agree?

&gt;Crying about censorship is itself also a social attack,

"**Argumentum ad populum**

In argumentation theory, an argumentum ad populum (Latin for ""argument to the people"") is a fallacious argument that concludes that a proposition must be true because many or most people believe it, often concisely encapsulated as: ""If many believe so, it is so.""

This type of argument is known by several names, including appeal to the masses, appeal to belief, appeal to the majority, appeal to democracy, appeal to popularity, argument by consensus, consensus fallacy, authority of the many, bandwagon fallacy, vox populi, and in Latin as argumentum ad numerum (""appeal to the number""), fickle crowd syndrome, and consensus gentium (""agreement of the clans""). It is also the basis of a number of social phenomena, including communal reinforcement and the bandwagon effect. The Chinese proverb ""three men make a tiger"" concerns the same idea.

I'm going to try and **not** sound like a shill as much as I can whilst delivering the information that I've accumulated since the project begun. Basically, Qash is a Japanese FSA regulated liquidity token (Important due to the Coinbase CEO saying in his most recent interview they'll only be working with regulated tokens, adding ERC20 tokens and GDAX likely being used in Worldbook) at the moment. It's somewhat useless because it's only half of the puzzle. The main part is WorldBook which saw its Beta get pushed back a month due to 3rd party hardware issues. It was set to launch end of May, It'll likely be a month later. 

The Worldbook is a multi-exchange order book that matches crypto to crypto, and crypto to fiat and the reverse across all currencies. So say someone is selling Bitcoin is USD on exchange1 not owned by Quoine and someone is buying Bitcoin in EURO on exchange 2 not owned by Quoine. If the forex conversions and crypto conversions match then the trade will go through and the Worldbook will match it, it'll make the sale and the purchase on either exchange and each user will get what they wanted. I believe it can do thousands or millions of these trades a second which means exchanges with lower liquidity if they join the Worldbook will be able to fill orders and take trade fees they otherwise would miss out on.

They turned it on to test it a few months ago for an hour or so and their exchange was the top exchange in the world by 4x volume for the day because all Worldbook trades ran through it.

At the moment it's Qryptos and Quoinex which are the two exchanges but they're going to be consolidated and rebranded under the Liquid brand. They purchased Liquid.com for $750k and when Liquid has the Worldbook running it'll dwarf other exchanges for volume. 


Here's a lovely summary of Mike's latest AMA.

**On QASH and the blockchain**

* QASH is a liquidity token. We are packaging our platform and white labelling it. There’s an element of connecting liquidity.
* GBX platform is essentially our platform. We are going to do that in every large continent. Those who whitelabel our platform, the QASH token will be a standard token there.
* Binance wants BNB to be used on their one exchange. We want our QASH token embedded in all our partners.
* Our aspiration is is for local exchanges to tap into this liquidity.
* We will scale our white label solution into these markets, expanding utility, which brings up value.
* I believe in decentralisation, but when you touch currency, governments and states won’t let you go.
* There needs to be a hybrid.
* Performance and latency are key.
* We need to be able to cope with high frequency traders. If can’t stay up to innovation as an exchange you will go out of business.
* When you are a decentralised exchange and you have these nodes, latency between nodes can be a killer. If you want to do tens of thousands of transactions every minute and want to have an automated investment strategy, you can’t do that on a decentralised exchange.
* But we are trying to find a combination where it’s distributed but with a certain amount of control.
* There’s no blockchain we could migrate our services onto that can be used for financial services. We need high frequency, high performance, low latency.
* Our blockchain will be commercial not academic. Don’t need to reinvent the wheel, but have something that any fintech company can launch their services from day one.
* The native token is QASH.


and more about the world book

**On the World Book**

* New matching engine does multi market orders.
* Already connected to 17 exchanges: 3 in US, 2 in Europe, and others scattered.
* When we look at counterparty risk, only a handful of exchanges where we would want to put our liquidity.
* The important part is to have multi-market orders so someone can trade in own base currency but tap into other markets and pairs seamlessly.
* That's where hidden tech comes in.
* MMO goes live next week, first part of World Book.

If banks love it so much and it has such an awesome use case, why appeal to crypto market at all? maybe ask us like outsiders and we will oblige and throw some crumbs. But keep openly hating btc in your sub, declaring yourself the best crypto and openly saying btc should die for xrp to go up, coming here to beg for money as xrp is the biggest dump of the last 4 months, and we will point and laugh at morally bankrupt ceos and bag holders of ripple.

"So you are saying that Segwit had no consensus, and had to be sneaked in via a softfork? Which might explain the low adoption rate to,this day.

It doesn't make a difference if an upgrade is soft fork or hard fork, buggy software can mess up the network in both cases. How come the Core team has not the competence to properly execute hard forks, whereas they are routine upgrades in Monero, Ethereum, Dash and Bitcoin Cash? Could it be that that argument was just concern trolling?

The Core developers were invited to the NYA, but didn't deem it necessary to show up, and which isn't surprising given their inability to negotiate and make a compromise.

Segwit is only an upgrade to 2.2Mb on average, hardly enough to satisfy future needs, and Lightning can only work in a centralized hubs and spokes model.

A crypto could be designed to be anonymous, or you could just have two wallets. Honestly, you would not want to carry around your life savings every time you went to the grocery store, that wouldn't be smart. Also, if you went into a store and pulled out a large roll of $100 bills, the merchant could also see you had a lot of money on you, so the current situation for crypto wallets is similar to paper money.

You can't blame crypto problems on criminals, the number one currency used by criminals is still the US dollar. Criminals will use whatever is available, and don't care about laws and rules. Mining is going to be replaced with something else, its just too inefficient, as the Bitcoin farms have come to show. Many 3rd gen cryptos do no mining at all, and just have the transacting computers do a small amount of work to verify the transaction, instead of paying third parties to make blocks.

Most gen 1 cryptos suck for payments, but several altcoins are actually quite fast and cheap or free, so this could go mainstream, if they could just get over the network effect that keeps everyone using paper (or digital version of paper) money.

Though the past is not a metric that can foretell the future it shows that the potential is there, within reasonable range.

Another strategy is to wait for even lower prices. Personally I bought some more recently at 6.7k based on my experiences since I started with bitcoin after the crash in early February. If that turns out to be a good purchase only time will tell, but that's my wager. If people wait for 6k and it happens then congratulations to them.
