"Segwit is an experiment that probably cant be removed from BTC. We don't know if it will make BTC unable to scale if it tries. They say they will not try to scale since that does not fit the Blockstream business model (they want high fees so everyone has to pay the corporation fees instead of paying the miners). If they go back on their word again and try to scale (hardfork in a bigger blocksize), it could help a lot in the short run. Few would trust the people behind this whole fiasco though. ",1523948264

* 2FA, Good captcha solution like that from binance, KYC etc. good security is important
* When buying / selling something with a very different value than the current price, it should notify you, so you don't accidently set an order with one digit less or more. With some prices in crypto this can easily happen.
* ideally it would be decentralized. Every bit of centralization in crypto is a weak point in my opinion.
* Would love to see those ugly giveaways / competitions go away. They often look like they came from a online casino page and in most cases only benefit those that buy the most anyway.
* A good app or at least mobile version of the website should be a no brainer and still most suck quite a bit. A user interface made specifically for mobile would be really great.
* Let me convert all small amounts to something else. Often when selling everything I have of a coin, there is still a very small bit left that can't be sold as it is not enough. Especially a problem on binance, I really don't like that
* Clear visibility on the connection status and ping to the server.
* Nice trade history and export of trades as csv (and please let me set some basic filters)",1523948200

Granted, people speculate that BTC may be six figures in a couple of years, and it's possible, but I'm not necessarily convinced that BTC specifically will get there. The coin is being held hostage by Blockstream. 

There are numerous coins now that are quite low compared to where they used to be, as they fell faster than Bitcoin. They'll also grow faster than Bitcoin as the market recovers.

Staying in the top 50, I'm personally inclined to believe in coins like Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Stellar, NEO, Monero, Wanchain, Substratum, Factom, Power Ledger, Request Network to pick my personal ""most likely to succeed"" coins. But I'm sure I'm biased and possibly misinformed...

"Wow, you Bitcoin supports are cult-like and delusional if you consider Bitcoin's blockchain tech to be the most superior crypto project out there. Just because something has been around for years doesn't mean it is the best choice. As I have posted elsewhere, Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and has been around for many years. However, where is its mass adoption by major retailers, companies, etc.? When you think about it, the only mainstream adoption Bitcoin has is that of serving as the de-facto base/exchange currency at a majority of crypto exchanges. Bitcoin has, what I like to call, ""sporadic boutique"" retail usage here and there, but nothing noteworthy after 10 years in the game. Let me put it this way. If Bitcoin's network is so magnificent then why don't we hear of its worldwide domination of fiat currency etc.?? Let me be clear, I'm not bashing Bitcoin. Like I've stated elsewhere the blockchain technology that gave rise to Bitcoin has ushered in a whole new industry around digital securities/assets allowing the transfer of digital property/value, such that the transfer is guaranteed to be safe and secure. I will keep typing this until my hands fall off. Adoption is key here. Bitcoin doesn't have it.



If Bitcoin had a remote chance of becoming the global digital asset standard it needed to have garnered support from those in the global financial community who control monetary policy (i.e. IMF, World Bank, BIF, Central banks, ECB, PBoC etc.). I believe Bitcoin would have been more readily accepted by the broader financial/banking/regulatory community had there been a more conciliatory partnership to help make improvements to the overall system. This chasm created by Bitcoin, coupled with the lack of network scalability etc. gave rise to others, like Ripple, who saw the opportunity to strategically place themselves as the antithesis of Bitcoin's anti-bank stance and technological disadvantages. Instead of following the footsteps of Bitcoin in opposition to the entire banking/financial system, Ripple embraced the role of helping banks/regulators modernize the antiquated financial systems in place around payments of all types (cross-border, Retail, P2P, B2B, etc.). This show of good-faith, cooperation, and support from Ripple to the broader financial, banking, and regulatory community worldwide has not gone unrewarded. This pretentious idea many in the “cryptosphere” have believing governments and central banks around the world are going to relinquish the reigns of monetary policy, AML, KYC, and CFT laws to the PoW or consensus mechanism performed by a cryptocurrency or digital asset without having rules and regs in place to govern such said processes is simply nonsense.",1523947683

"Come on... serious? Look at how many devs are doing meaningful commits, and then try again. I’m talking active development—not documentation updates and minor bug fixes. 

SegWit actually doubles the block size, but only if there are enough SegWit transactions in the block to fill the space not being counted toward fees. A straight doubling of the block size would therefore have been more effective since it doesn’t discriminate in this manner and all transactions could benefit. And for what? The transactions themselves end up using more space so it is more physical resources being used for less throughput (vs a straight blocksize increase of the same magnitude). It also introduces a couple of attack vectors that didn’t exist before. Furthermore, because it didn’t have consensus, it was pushed through as a soft fork which means they had to do a ton of extra coding in order to trick legacy nodes into accepting any new SegWit blocks. This introduces a huge opportunity for a lot of bugs to emerge. 

SegWit was never about scaling as it is a poor and complicated solution for that. It was about the malleability fix needed by LN. Maybe the pair will someday be able to handle December level transaction volume, but right now that is provably not the case. Further, the system is provably worse than it would be if they had simply doubled the block size. Right now. That’s not to say things won’t improve in the future, but to say that BTC can easily handle December level volume in its current state is very very false. ",1523947139

- Funds being vulnerable if your node goes down
- Trusting and paying a 'watchtower' to prevent the above
- Losing the built in immutable ledger from the blockchain
- Paying wealthy hubs for existing instead of miners for doing work

Dammit no; it's a bird, it's a plane, it's Lightning!!!  It's just laughable to see so many clinging to this delusional fantasy of how Bitcoin and its new and improved ""Lightning Network"" it is going to solve the scaling and exploding transactional cost problems. The truth is that there is a huge misunderstanding that unlimited scaling (via the new Lightning Network) will solve all Bitcoin's problems. Because every open/close of an LN channel means an expansion in transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, causing the bottleneck shifts from a limit on the transactions that can be processed on-chain to a bottleneck on how many payment channels can be opened or closed at any given time. It's important to remember that Lightning doesn't allow instant settlement of funds. That means that you can't spend lightning funds until the lightning channel has been closed and the final state transmitted to the blockchain. Effectively what lightning does is allow a massive increase in the capacity for changing ownership of BTC but the BTC doesn't ""move"" until the channel closes. This means that if more than 7 channels want to close per second you will once again get lag.",1523946649

"Well let's take the poster's number's that you're responding to, They audit .8% of people filing returns. Now imagine crypto / coinbase transactions automatically flagged you for an Audit. How much sheer workload would that be that the IRS simply isn't staffed to handle?

Recall seeing the last number at roughly 6% of American's own crypto. So their workload would be .8% of population audited --&gt; 8.3% of the filing population audited.

That seems unreasonable. And they probably look at the numbers of refunds issued with most audits and see them as something that they actually want to avoid doing. They may want to be able to tax crypto, but I think they realize that, right now, they don't have an effective mechanism to make it easy for users to pay. And trying to audit a ton of people for not filing it properly when they themselves aren't super clear with it,  just doesn't make sense.",1523945653

"Yeah, that's the typical BS shade/response that is always thrown at Ripple/XRP. Haters reject what they fear or don't understand. While Ripple does hold a considerable share of XRP, they have been good stewards of this massive trove and to prove that they recently locked-up 55-billion into 55 escrow accounts with 1 billion to be released every month. The excess XRP left over at the end of each month goes back into another Escrow account and the cycle starts over again. This Escrow lock-up was done to mitigate the idea of them flooding the market with XRP. XRP Escrow: https://ripple.com/insights/ripple-escrows-55-billion-xrp-for-supply-predictability/.  Ripple's success hinges upon the successful adoption of XRP by the financial/retail/corporate industries, so it would be suicide for them to undermine their most strategic and valuable weapon. They understand that in order to maintain network reliability to mitigate the risk of a single point of failure the XRP-Ledger needed to be able to securely run without depending on any one entity. Ripple selects its validators based on diversity, performance, reliability, and security. They purposely have not rushed this process in order to do the proper due-diligence selecting leading data centers throughout the world like WorldLink, Telindus-Proximus Group, Bahnhof (Swedish ISP), AT TOKYO Corporation, Microsoft, MIT, and CGI. Just because Ripple isn't following the same ""cookie cutter"" path to decentralization like every other blockchain entity out there doesn't mean they are not cognizant of the importance of decentralization. If you are more technically savvy, I recommend downloading the PDF file on Ripple’s new whitepaper regarding the new update to the XRP Consensus Ledger featuring Cobalt (link #2 below, PDF file link will be on the right-hand side). It goes into great details as to Ripple’s plans to make the XRP Consensus Ledger even more dynamic and robust as well as clarify and further define how this new protocol will allow them to create more diverse UNLs.

However, at the end of the day, it all comes down to adoption. Individuals like yourself can't seem to come up with a counter as to why Ripple's blockchain tech (xCurrent, xVia, ILP, and yes, even xRapid/XRP) is being used/implemented by real businesses, over +100 FIs and Banks, or the +40 central bank consortium. Yet, the closest thing to adoption we hear coming from likes of Ethereum or Bitcoin that remotely resembles adoption are proofs-of-concept, MOUs, atm machines, or some random ""boutique"" retail outlets. You also have never heard of RippleNet having any ""scaling issues"" or ""downtime.""",1523944970

Here's what I put together today, it's heavy on BTC this week so bear with me.

42% BTC: Rinse, cut in halves length-wise and bake flat side down at 425 degrees for 25 minutes. This is a slow cooker so prepare the other ingredients in the meantime.

25% DGB: Pat dry with a paper towel, sprinkle with salt and pepper and sear on medium-high for 5-8 minutes each side.

11% OMG: Chop in a bowl, toss with lemon, salt, pepper, and a bit of oil and Italian seasoning.

10% LRC: Serve cold or with honey mustard.

6% ETH: Slice loaf to desired thickness.

6% ETC: To complement the ETH.

Enjoy! Tune in next week for the next shitcoin recipe for more gainz :)",1523943962

Alas, time to shill my personal sub 10m shitcoin:

25m circulating, reached an ATH of $2.89 in the January bullrun. Now it's currently priced at $0.10. Why invest in a coin that's down 99%?

Because it's down 99%. 

ICO was ~7 months ago and and since then no real development took place due to internal conflict between CEO and Developer.

About a month ago a FUD campaign started during BTC at 6k to further destroy this coins price.

Flash forward to present day. The internal conflict never got resolved which is why the CEO made the initiative to work behind the scenes in preparation for a potential fork, and relaunch a new coin.(There's a reason for the fork but I won't go into specifics.)

Either way, if you want a true 100x, you need to make take some risks. Personally, I'm optimistic for this coin. Way more optimistic than I would ever be towards a logistics coin.. (pointless coin like denta)

What the paper means, is _in the realm of CT_ the inflation is possible. However, if your system is not all-CT, but has a cleartext realm too (as would be when CT is deployed in Bitcoin), then you the effects of silent/uncontrolled inflation in-CT will become equivalent to a theft from the perspective of the cleartext realm.

That said, another issue is if the attacker never actually withdraws cleartext coins making theft eventually obvious, but continues silently exploiting the system until the trust in CT realm naturally erodes and the market emerges with different prices for cleartext coins and encrypted coins.

Would be interesting to figure out how to make a global proof of solvency across all encrypted coins once in a while...

Pure speculation but gold did very well during the last major recession Bitcoin may mirror it as an exit from the stock market. Bitcoin hasn't been battle tested against a recession yet. So we're not sure what the market will decide during that time. 

&gt;massive job losses and possibly a world wide recession

People are starting to flee the system that can cause those job losses and recession. 

Bitcoin can't return to $1 a coin. It will fade into irrelevance long before it hits $1.

"No one accepts lightning payments yet, but I can send them to other nodes for less fees than BCH.

But you can't send me 1BTC with lightning if you have 1BTC. This may seem trivial, but it adds complexity for the end user. Dummies want to be able to send 1 nano with 1 nano, and they can.

1, you can run a node, and it is easier than running a BTC node

I think you're mistaken. I tried to run a nano node and found it requires IPv6 and an SSD for storage. In contrast I run a bitcoin node on a Raspberry Pi with 1 GB RAM and an HDD.

You only have to run the desktop wallet to run a node, doesn't need much tech but does take awhile to download the blocklattice.

Lightning transactions can be streamed, i.e. I can send transactions as quickly as data can be sent over the internet.

Nano payments fit into a single packet, they can transfer faster than lightning or atleast as fast as anything else on the internet.

Nano transactions can not be, because of the PoW.

Yes they can, you can precompute the proof of work

Nano doesn't support any form of smart contract, as opposed to BTC.

Its a tradeoff of the tiny transaction size, well worth it for the benefit of a small transaction history and speed. Something like Iota or Ethereum will be needed for on chain contracts... 

So Bitcoin will be able to do more TPS than nano, more securely, in a more decentralised manner, with simple smart contracts such as multi-sig and timelocks. If LN succeeds, Nano has zero value. It's that simple.

Still can't do fee free, and still has inflation, dummies won't pay lightning fees if they don't have to, no matter how small.

I don't want to patronise you because you've been polite, but this is absolutely not how LN or BTC works.

LN is a layer on top of BTC. Every lightning channel is represented on the Bitcoin blockchain as a multi-signature transaction. Without the blockchain lightning cannot exist.

Well if lightning does work it can be used on any blockchain with smart contracts, and another blockchain that does not have the legacy costs of BTC would be very attractive and competitive. Good luck.",1523940527

Finally, if Lightning is so good when finally working, it would be better off to do away with the BTC aspect, as most users would never interact with the main chain anyway.",1523939127

I think the big point of debate between socialists and capitalists  nowadays are ""equal outcome"" vs. ""equal opportunity"".

This is completely different from socialists' ""equal outcome"", where they want to change the outcome (instead of opportunity) to virtue signal equality.

You're comparing apples to oranges. All crypto rises and crashes against fiat. What is valuable info is the relative value of the cryptocurrencies, for example ETH vs BTC, or BTC vs BCH in my example. You could see when the ICO craze started that ETH gained a lot of ground vs BTC, and that has nothing to do with the fiat market.

&gt; What are your objective reasons that LTC is superior to BCH?

* More decentralised
* More transaction value over network
* More liquidity (greater percentage of coins move each day)
* Adopted segwit
* Adopted lightning
* Doesn't put businesses over users like BCH which forces the protocol to be upgraded instead of business infrastructure (segwit vs. 8 MB).

Bitcoin Core opposed the hard fork.

At one point we had nearly every major Bitcoin company, as well as the majority of hashing power, supporting on-chain scaling, via the BitcoinXT initiative:

https://bitcoinxt.software/industry-letter.pdf

Which was also supported by the original Bitcoin Core developer Gavin Andresen, and Bitcoinj developer Mike Hearn. Jeff Garzik, another Bitcoin Core developers in support of on-chain scaling, created the BIP 100 proposal.

Later, even more Bitcoin companies signed up for the much more modest Segwit2x initiative:

https://medium.com/@DCGco/bitcoin-scaling-agreement-at-consensus-2017-133521fe9a77

In both cases the majority of Bitcoin Core developers opposed the change.

"&gt; I don't see this as promotion, or any more political than Bitcoin's genesis block is.

The genesis block promotes (I'll stand by that word) a particular article which described a decision by a state.  I don't think it was ideal, but at least it was general criticism of the system - not a promotion of certain elements within it.

If Satoshi had directed people toward a particular politician's social media, I think thought would have been massively problematic, don't you think?

Sure.  The material got posted and upvoted, and that's fine.  I don't agree with the speech myself, but I don't have a huge issue with it being on Bitcoin's front page.

"&gt; At nChain he is the supposed technical guy

Wrong. He is the guy on top of a team with over 60 technical guys, researchers and engineers. I'm sure CSW is well past the stage where he has to code Reddit bots to prove his worth. His experience and holistic knowledge puts him in a position where he can manage overall efforts. Gregory Maxwell had a similar job and his biggest achievement, judging from when he uncorked champaign, was when BTC was crippled once and for all with $100 transaction fees. 

&gt;but since the nChain business is to sell patents, it doesn't matter stuff they make doesn't work

nChain sells patents, hence his work is judged based on what he manages to sell and the profit he generates. No company operates at a loss. Since they love him there, he must be doing a great job selling patents and acquiring patents. 

Beware that this is a guy who has over $3.5M in personal angel funds (4000bch). In other words more than what Lightning could raise in their last round with investors.

&gt;only that you can convince guys like Jon Matonis it does, as he is not a computer expert

He is not a geek, hacker. He is much more than a computer expert, he is also an economist, a lawyer etc. This gives him a holistic understanding of bitcoin that allows him to debate economics even with economics experts such as Jon Matonis. 

&gt;I dare you show where he reviewed and agreed with any CSW technical work. So far their relationship is summarized as CSW bamboozling him (the first of many in crypto space) gaining reputation at expense of Gavin, fucking him over, and lastly,

CSW is not an undergrad student, nobody needs to review/agree his technical work. The market reviews his technical work and obviously the market prizes CSW much more than Jorge Stolfi, Emin Gun Sirer, or Peter Rizun.

You are lying when you say 

&gt; So far their relationship is summarized as CSW bamboozling him

you could say this only if Gavin had accused him of bamboozling him. As far as I know this has never happened, I also know that Gavin liked a tweet saying whoever speaks foul of CSW reveals more about themselves than CSW. 

&gt;making Gavin second guess his opinions of CSW by publishing his famous forged proof of being Satoshi.

Again you are lying, blatantly. Gavin always said he was sure CSW was Satoshi based on the proof he had shown him on private. The public proof CSW was forced to release to the public against his will was fake. This means that CSW proved it to Gavin, but refused to provide public proof. You trying to spin this proves you are a Blockstream troll. RES earned.

&gt;Hey, at least I think now it is very clear of Falkvinge on the subject. Last we spoke you was in denial. 

I was not in denial, I was sticking to facts. CSW has PhDs and masters, so /u/falkvinge couldn't have been speaking of him. Recent comments by Falkvinge make it clear that apparently he was speaking of CSW indeed, although if we look objectively at Falkvinge's criteria CSW is the least likely candidate.

&gt;And we also have Jorge Stolfi, Emin Gün Sirer, Peter Rizun, Vitalik Buterin...

Aside from Vitalik, which I think is young and will come around one day, the rest are not worth considering especially in light of their recent behaviors. They are just a bunch of coders, with very little perspective on bitcoin and who get lost in ad homs as soon as they get out of their little holes.

"Thanks for the conversation, this is my favorite part of the community. Civil discourse.

I don't mean Bitmain will always own 51% or more of the network, but it seems likely to me that some entity (or a few entities) will, simply due to economy of scale. Even when Bitmain no longer has a monopoly I believe there will most likely be a few entities that dominate the hashrate. From a practical standpoint that would mean maybe 4-10 groups would have the majority (in my opinion). That means we would be relying on a few large entities not to collude. 

Its simply not economical for home miners to run based on the cost of power. This may change as we go over to more alternative energy sources, but once again who knows how long that will be. Also, Bitmain has a massive head start in terms of capital available and hash power available, it would take a pretty major player to cut into that. Ideally the hash rate would be distributed to home miners, but even Satoshi knew that wasn't realistic. His idea of specialized mining centers relied on the idea that everyone would be playing by the same set of rules. This is not true when you have countries like China that can churn out power at a fraction of the cost due to lax environmental standards. There is a reason the majority of the hash rate comes from China.

Relying on a few large entities not to collude just doesn't seem all that much different to me than many other alts. It seems slightly hypocritical that its okay for BTC to be centralized at the moment but decentralize over time, but when other coins offer the same plan it is scoffed at. How is Bitmain gradually losing their monopoly all that much different than Ripple slowly removing their validators? Or IOTA removing their coordinator? All currently have aspects of centralization, but all are moving in the direction of full decentralization.

From a technical standpoint no one in is in charge of development, that's true. From a practical standpoint it's not. It would take a massive amount of resources to subvert the direction Core wants to take it. This also applies to the other altcoins as well, the vast majority are open source. Even the epitome of centralization in the communities eyes (Ripple) is open source and encourages third party development. 

Those individuals may be all about Bitcoin only personally, but once again the companies arent. Google is an early investor in Ripple, IBM is partnered with Stellar, Mike Hearns is no longer a BTC proponent, Request Network is a Y Combinator backed project. There are also plenty of ex Facebook, Google, Apple etc execs that have thrown there support behind alts (not that I think that means all that much). Not to mention the mass amount of large corporations that are part of the Hyperledger consortium. I do think Bitcoin will be successful, but I am not closed off to the possibility that corporations and other institutions may choose to go another direction.

Just like BTC, many altcoins have extremely devoted communities that are now comparable to BTCs following pre 2017. NANO is one in particular that has a ton of community engagement, it definitely has its own set of issues to take care of and is far from perfect but it has a community that really believes in its ability to help people and possibly help reduce the environmental impact from BTC. That may be naive, but they will defend it to the death. They legitimately love NANO, the same way I used to love BTC. They may not have the same amount of capital to throw around, but some of those communities really remind me a lot of BTC in the earlier days. The enthusiasm and the ""we can do anything"" attitude of NANO is actually nice to see. Sure many may be a part of the""lambo packs"", that may be true for 95% but the other 5% are extremely dedicated and competent and they don't necessarily believe BTC is the right direction to go. NANO has a pretty active third party community.

All of this isn't even taking into account the performance issues that BTC has been plagued with. The fact of the matter is that it has serious performance concerns. Even if someone was spamming the network, that means that it's relatively easy to spam the network essentially into uselessness. LN may take care of many of those issues, but I have been hearing that for awhile. Also, I have been doing a lot of research on LN and it's virtually indistinguishable from the BTC I know. Even if it doesn't develop into a hub and spoke pattern, which I believe it will if mass adopted, the watchtower idea as well as the fact that it almost seems inevitable that there will be additional fees for people to provide liquidity means it is moving farther and farther away from the original idea. They won't be doing that out of the goodness of their hearts, which basically takes the peer to peer aspect of it away. Not to mention the fact that doing it off chain takes away half of the point, the immutable ledger of transactions.

I'm not necessarily disagreeing with you about BTC. I just think that many maximalists have kind of closed their eyes to the ecosystem developing outside of BTC. I wouldn't be so quick to dismiss them all.

"Technically, there's effectively no additional electricity expended between a block that has one transaction versus a block with 2,000 transactions.

So that's a useless metric.

Now it is true that Bitcoin mining uses a lot of electricity.  Roughly in the range of 3,500 MW +/-.     That's 84M kWh/day.

There are somewhere in the range of 200,000 Bitcoin on-chain transactions per day.   That's means that's about 420 kWh per transaction.   

A house in the U.S. is just under 12,000 kWh/year, thus roughly 33 kWh/day.

So 420 kWh per transaction divided by 33 kWh/day means a transaction uses as much electricity as does a house for 13 days, roughly.

Now lightning transactions are not easily measurable, so as the hashrate rises (and thus electricity consumption rises as well) the ratio of electricity used by mining per on-chain transaction will continue to increase, since there's a block weight limitation that factors in at some level above the current daily level of ~200,000 transactions/day. 

So while saying a transaction uses the same amount of power as house would technically be wrong, ... it does communicate how there's really a lot of electricity used in Bitcoin mining. ",1523935041

"&gt;How do you correlate something that's literally denominated in what you're comparing it too?

As I already asked, what does it matter if the BTC/ETH to fiat price is used when determining the price of a given altcoin in fiat? You can still obtain a price (in fiat) for altcoin A, and you have a price in fiat for ETH/BTC. So to answer your question, you'd calculate the correlation by plugging those prices into the equation for correlation. In other words, the exact same way you'd calculate any other correlation.

Do you think that calculating the correlation of two random variable requires the two variables to be independent or something?",1523934165
"Yeah it's totally a smear campaign.

The reality is that back in the day, when it wasn't clear what bitcoin was, I did my taxes and I just called it income. 

Now, this year for the first time, I'm doing it as capital gains, short and long term. It's easier now because there are sights like bitcoin.tax and cointracking.info

Otherwise it would be nearly impossible to calculate beyond ""fairly accurately""

&gt; ""No VIP seats for the wealthy. Assistance for the not-so-wealthy.""

"This is a bit of a mess, monetarily.

In his bitcoin world, he says that the government's expenditures are capped at 5% of the total money supply, and that won't be funded via taxes. So the government is just expanding the money supply at 5% a year, every year. And then he adds that everyone gets a UBI while abolishing welfare, social security, and the rest of the welfare state. While that's well and good - and it's a position I personally think makes a lot of sense - the state would not be able to afford a reasonable UBI if capped at 5% of the money supply, because that 5% includes many other services beyond welfare. Finally, his system (which is magically tax-free) fails to account for how states, not the federal government, would receive revenue. After all, there are no taxes, so unless the individual states are also inflating the bitcoin supply to fund themselves, then they are without funds.

As further proof that Dan knows more about programming than he does managing the money supply, his plan is just a bad version of the existing system. States, via fiat money, possess the capability to finance themselves through inflation by printing more money than there is demand for. His system - the state printing money to finance itself - is functionally the same. The only way such a system would avoid long-term inflation is if the state keeps the rate of money supply expansion less than or equal to the rate of overall economic growth. Since every measure of economic growth is backward-looking (not to mention controversial), keeping that limit is not practicable. Even if that metric could be accurately obtained and adhered to, our reward would limit the state's ability to conduct counter-cyclical policies to stimulate growth in downturns, the necessity of which was the great lesson of the Great Depression.

Watching this made me think less of Dan, in all honesty. I know his reputation and have met several people he's worked with. He's unquestionably an extremely talented programmer, business developer, and entrepreneur. But I don't think his expertise in those areas has expanded to cover monetary policy yet. Nothing in this utopia makes economic sense.",1523932784

"Thanks for your thoughts.

It kinda' astounds me how people who got into bitcoin (which has thoroughly shaken up a whole bunch of old world status quo's we thought was never going to change) will then go on to cite entities like Bitmain as if they are going to be here forever.  Clearly, with companies like Halong and Samsung entering the mining space, the days of any one entity being able to play fast and loose with their mining power are numbered.  

We mustn't forget either that backup plans (such as an emergency PoW change) would brick their entire enterprise.  

&gt;corruption is just a part of life, and I don't see the people in charge of bitcoins development as immune to it. 

That's the thing, no-one is *in charge* of bitcoin's development.

When we talk about Bitcoin's greatest strength when it comes to decentralisation... It is really in the open, transparent and fully decentralised processes that have been put into place *on the coding side*, and the strict peer-review from 1,000's of computer scientists and engineers from MIT to UCL that ensures no single line of code can be added without going unchecked...  These are people that can come and go as they see fit, who do not need to be paid by a corporation where they feel cooped up in an office environment.

It is a system where no one person has any more 'power' than any other.  And so it is bitcoin's resilience to power corrupting that remains it's greatest USP.

As for corruption being a part of life.  That really depends on who you have around you in your life and the kinds of morals they were bought up to follow.  Some believe in the Golden Rule, or 'treat others as you wish to be treated yourself'; some keep our promises; some do not believe business has to be ruthless.  In fact, that entire corporate philosophy of ""don't be evil"" expresses the idea that we can make money and do good things in the world without exploiting others.  Adam Back and Austin Hill took it a step further and asked could we build a network that ""can't be evil""?

So, again, just because an entire generation of people fell for the lie of ""greed is good"" does not mean the world will always remain that way.  Indeed, many of the younger generations called bullshit on that a long time ago when they saw the cliff edge it leads to...

&gt;I do think it can be a bit dangerous to just assume silence means that they are working on BTC sidechains, silence could mean anything from them working quietly with Hyperledger to them not being interested in cryptocurrency at all.

These are fair points.  Although I would remind people that ex Google Security Engineer Mike Hearn (who famously rage quit BTC) was the 2nd person to start coding on bitcoin in his 20% time at Google and was running an internal email group of 400 googlers whilst regularly reporting back to Larry.  

Paul Graham (Y-Combinator) has come out in support of bitcoin and said he has no interest in alts like ethereum via his twitter.  Chamath Palihapitiya (ex-Facebook executive) has been vocal about his love of bitcoin and stressed that it would take years to scale and 'become a payment instrument'.  

AirBnB (which came from Y-Combinator) hired the Changetip team some two or more years ago.  Developers on Google's unified web payment gateway dropped BTC as an example currency into the docs.  Coupled all of that with the pro-bitcoin statements coming from the greatest computer scientists in this space (Szabo et al), I think there's enough dots there that can be joined to figure out where this is likely to go.

Not to mention all the real world bitcoin establishments and infrastructure that have taken years to permeate... the bitcoin meme has now been firmly sewn into the public consciousness in everything from episodes of the Simpsons and Family guy to monuments in Slovenia, pop songs, Hollywood movies, and modern art... 

Cliched as it may sound, a lot of people in this world really do love bitcoin.  

No amount of slick marketing campaigns or cleverly coded 'bigger, faster, stronger' altcoin coding adjustments can buy any of that love.  

Which means for all it's chaotic quirks and imperfections, that love and the huge diversity of the ecosystem alone means it remains in good stead to weather whatever storm is thrown at it.

The group behind this are long-term thinkers and may do many mini-crashes along the way up (to gather massive BTC), so, this could take quite a while. The last one was years between the 1k and 20k pump. I think they plan to use BTC at least one more time. If they are not keeping it alive, it seems unlikely it would be recovering from crashing since smart money can see it lacks the fundamentals to succeed long-term. ",1523932147

If you want to sell now, its not as simple as recognizing whether you want to sell. Unless you want to cash out of crypto entirely, you most likely want to buy in lower. So, you need both an exit and an entrance strategy. Bitcoin has a nasty habit of turning around when you least suspect it.

"An interesting read from the Princeton classes on blockchain technology, which was published before the fork in 2016:

On pages 172-173: 

""The interesting case is if the fork reflects a fight between two groups about what the future of Bitcoin should be -- in other words, a rebellion in the Bitcoin community, where a subgroup decides to break off, because they think they have a better idea about how the system should be run. In that case, the two branches are rivals and will fight for market share. A-coin and B-coin will each try to persuade more merchants to accept it and more people to buy it. Each will want to be perceived as the ""real Bitcoin"". There may be a public-relations fight, where each claims legitimacy and portrays the other as a weird splinter group.

The probable outcomes is that one branch will eventually win and the other will fade away. These sorts of competitions tend to tip in one direction. Once one of the two is viewed as more legitimate and obtains a bigger market share, the network effect will prevail, and the other becomes a niche currency that will eventually fade away. The rule set and the governance structure of the winner will become the de facto rule set and governance structure of Bitcoin.""

"This is a decision you will have to make for yourself. It's up to you to evaluate if you think the long term prospects of bitcoin is worth it.

There's nothing wrong with taking out profits for yourself when you think that the price has reached a proper level. Like others have said, this will also be dependent on your private economy.

Study the fundamentals of bitcoin and make up your mind based on your evaluation of the value of the technology and where you think it is going to be 1-5 years from now. If you prefer to consider more immediate perspectives, then cashing out at a time when you have a profit, such as now, could be a good and safe strategy.

Personally I think that bitcoin is worth more than the current price at 8k. The recent bounces at 6k, 6.4k and 6.6k, in my opinion give decent indications that the market considers bitcoin sufficiently undervalued at those levels to merit a strong buying pressure. However, I could be wrong and don't take my opinions as financial advice; cryptocurrency markets can change for the better or worse in a short period of time.

I prefer to keep my investments in bitcoin for the coming 2-5 years, but that's just because I have confidence in the fundamentals, have no need for that cash right now combined with the fact that I don't invest more than I am willing to lose.",1523930814

"&gt;Here's where I think you underestimate current tech, badly. Take a look at AWS Snowball. Already does petabyte level transfer into AWS data center.

I don't underestimate anything. It is you, actually, who ignored my argument. Again, fully validating the Bitcoin blockchain today takes something like ~4-6hrs on modern consumer hardware. If you start building (effective size) 2MB blocks on top, next year it will take *longer* than that, and this **factors in all the tech advances**. If you then keep increasing the block size, it will take longer and longer to validate that full blockchain. Eventually, you'll just run out of steam. This is simply because the blockchain grows faster than tech improves! And would be true today, not in 20yrs. This is not something you are addressing.

Example - 1GB blocks will give you a blockchain of ~50TB after ONE year, not after 10yrs. (Again, talking effective space on disk, not limits.)  I'll let you calculate the time it takes to download the whole thing from scratch. And then validate it. At 1Gbps it will take you about 5days to download. The year after, with another ~50TB, *and* assuming a 50% faster Internet, it will take you ~7days. One more year? Even longer. And that is on professional grade hardware!

And we all know 1GB is nowhere near enough for global adoption. That's just VISA-level. True global adoption would require what, 100 times as much? At least.

What that leads you to is a very precarious situation where if one node drops off, it's the end for that node because you cannot sync a new one!

And of course, let's not even mention the level of (de)centralization you reach if a node can only be run on AWS. But that's another story, and people like CSW are very happy with that. 


&gt; If you can't transfer by network, ship hard drives.

So a trusted setup, then?

&gt;Start from a good checkpoint, heck, embed block hashes at every 10000 blocks so the network can observe an old known trustworthy block.

Again a trusted setup? 

Btw, you also need to address the problem of UTXOs which have been created BEFORE your checkpoint. AND validate their accuracy. How are you gonna do that? Not saying it's impossible, but it's certainly FAR FROM OBVIOUS. This would be perhaps the holy grail... but Bitcoin is not like ETH which only requires the most recent state, Bitcoin needs the full blockchain to be able to validate the last block.

Blockchain size/growth is a huge problem. But I don't see this community address this issue. The problem won't go away just because you don't like it.

"One of the fundamental advantages of cryptocurrencies is that it is trustless. The internet, with its bgp, functions by everyone trusting everyone else to do the right thing, e.g routing my packets directly to the destination without tampering or inspecting what I'm doing. The service providers are king, they can, and on occasion have gone bad.

This also happens to be very similar to how our traditional banking system works across the world. One of the key reasons bitcoin was created and gained traction was that it allowed us to move our money as far away from a system like that as possible.

Lighting currently gets around the trust issue by having the sender build the entire route, and then using onion encryption around the hops.

The problem with this method is it just can't be scaled on the 'idealogical' network layout. It can however potentially be scaled while the network has a small amount of hubs with many spokes, i.e a simple layout  (more like the physical layout of the internet, but even simpler).

Although I believe lightning style channels and even small networks will have good uses, having the whole world on one lightning network is ridiculous and can't work without taking away the primary reasons we use cryptocurrencies in the first place. There are many fundamental problems that just get hand waved away or people just don't realize they exist in the first place. For example no fees going miners is a huge problem in the long term.

"I'm not saying BTC is dead or that alts are going to take over by any means, it is still a pretty large portion of my portfolio and the dev work alone will ensure it stays competetive but I also think there are other projects doing interesting things for niche use cases. I do think it can be a bit dangerous to just assume silence means that they are working on BTC sidechains, silence could mean anything from them working quietly with Hyperledger to them not being interested in cryptocurrency at all.

Microsoft's Daniel Buchner may only be interested in BTC but Microsoft is already a participant in IOTAs data marketplace, so it's not like they aren't open to working with alts. The ""Microsoft/IOTA"" partnership was blown out of proportion (by a Microsoft employee) but they are still working together. It's true that layer 2/3 solutions may make many alts obsolete, but who knows how long it will be until those are truly ready for widespread use, first mover advantage isn't always guaranteed to keep something on top.

I became somewhat cynical regarding the BTC development direction, I think it's almost inevitable that power consolidates in the hands of a few. I guess you could say I gave up too soon on decentralization, it just doesn't seem practically possible. Theoretically it's great but from a practical standpoint it's almost impossible. Even BTC, arguably the most decentralized cryptocurrency, has issues with centralization. This community fairly widely believes that Bitmain could potentially pull off a 51% attack, just that they have no economic incentive to do so. I fail to see the practical difference between that and other ""centralized"" alts, it seems hypocritical to call out other alts for centralization (not talking about you specifically) when BTC itself is pretty much controlled by one entity. This same discussion is going in the ETH/XMR communities after the fork seemingly exposed massive covert ASIC use within XMR. Yet people within those communities still have no problem calling other alts centralized trash despite the fact that the major cryptocurrencys have centralization problems of their own. People running nodes for alts have no incentive to attack their networks just like Bitmain has no incentive to attack BTC. Got off topic here though, kind integrated ranting haha. 

I guess much of it depends on why an individual is here. I am kind of the opposite of most (people can hate me if they want). I grew up, gained some money and perspective and realized that corruption is just a part of life, and I don't see the people in charge of bitcoins development as immune to it. If you look at it from a long term investing standpoint it just seems reasonable to hedge with other well established cryptocurrencys.

I can respect people that think otherwise though, I thought the same way up until early 2017. Maybe I'm just cynical, maybe I'm just selfish, maybe I just got tired, maybe I gave up on decentralization too soon but the world just doesn't seem to care about decentralized trust the way I used to. Most have no issue whatsoever with the status quo, and most new cryptocurrency investors don't care at all about true decentralization (besides using it to smear coins they hate), I guess I just decided it was easier to go with the flow rather than right against it. This kind of turned into a journal entry haha, but that's basically my rationale for investing in alts.

"Dems are always more likely to put rules and regulations around any system.  Republicans are more likely to let it ride and have the free market organize their own ""rules"". Rep. like to keep a small government and Dem's like to have the government overlooking and checking in on everything.  In the short term, no regulation can cause some pain. People will get hurt (i.e.- bitconnect) but after some time people and the markets adapt to their environment. Less regulation tends to let systems adapt more efficiently and accurately than with the friction of governmental regulation. Some regulations can be good and allow for less pain in the beginning. They can stop uneducated investors from getting scammed, protect people, and point industries in the right direction. Although, if there is too much it throttles innovation during the birth of an industry lowering its trajectory of change. Unfortunately, regulations usually come too late, are made by people with little to no understanding of the industry, and often have earmarks and partisan BS attached that help no one but the politicians. 

For instance, the peak of Bitcoin prices and the flurry of innovation in crypto, would not have been nearly as high had Hilary been elected. She has strong ties to Wall Street and the likelihood of her regulating the crypto space was much higher than Trump. That risk would have been priced into Bitcoin as investors would have been more scared to invest in the asset due to the skew in risk/reward. The rush into the space and peak of prices would have been muted. On the other hand, many uneducated investors lost money due to investing at the tail end of the bubble. This harm would have been reduced a little had the chance of regulation been on the table. So there is a balance to be had between free markets and smart regulation. ",1523929931

"&gt; and? even the wheel had to be advertised so people know how to use it and how it can benefit their lives...
The wheel was invented as a necessity to increase efficiency of agriculture about 5000 years ago, when seed was a loaned to farmers and they had to pay it back plus interest (the begin of debt). There was no need to advertise it. But again, this is about innovation, not economic growth. 

&gt; it was literally the lack of incentives to be innovative. There was no reason to develop a new product 
You ignore the reality. Soviet Union was very advanced in many fields as technological achievements prove till today. 
&gt; because in its current state it doesn't add anything at all. There is literally no reason to use bitcoin right now besides 

Wrong. Bitcoins allows permissionless and trustless transmission of wealth at way lower cost and much higher speed than fiat. It is economically more efficient, because it cuts out the middlemen through application of technology.

"Admittedly the proof is convoluted-as intended and written that way (the law) purposely! For as written, it IS constitutional. And it is because it does NOT generally apply to the average *american*.

But when one reads the *law* as shown/listed VERY well in Champions book, one can clearly see that most americans are not liable. For example one of the key definitions in the tax code is *US Person*. It does NOT mean what most-including myself originally-assume it means. 

Like much of legalize, one needs to know EXACTLY what a word or phrase means when in a legal setting. VERY often, a word or phrase in a legal setting has a VERY different or narrow meaning than in common/everyday use.

In any case, it is made Crystal clear in Champions book (came out in 2010 I think). And he has an excellent reputation for being the definitive source on the subject. Champion was also a source in Aaron Russo's documentary (2006) *Freedom to Fascism* which can be seen in its entirety on YT [here](https://youtu.be/ZKeaw7HPG04). Which also had among many others: Dr. Ron Paul, G. Edward Griffin, Edwin Vierra, Katherine Albrecht, Joe Bannister (former IRS CID employee), James Bovard and many more...

All operations in the bitcoin core code are based on an integer unit where the integer is equal to 1 satoshi.

When you see ""1.00000000 BTC"" it is actually 1e8 satoshis, which you can see here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/08a7316c144f9f2516db8fa62400893f4358c5ae/src/amount.h#L14

What I find so disturbing about this is they are actively advocating for socialism. The reason why VIP seats in capitalistic society exist is because that's how they subsidize for the people with less money. It's free market in play. People who value useless ""premium"" crap that comes with VIP seats can choose to do so, but the rest--even the ones who are rich but frugal--can decide to just pick the regular seats.

For some reason they decided to turn this into a political statement, and not only that, they wanted to emphasize how they're against capitalism, which I believe Bitcoin is all about. It's about free market, and how the transparency and trustlessness can actually make free market work.

What's really unsettling about this is not just the socialistic aspect, go ahead and browse through the rest of the website for their conference https://aantonop.events/ It's not only socialistic but also very much totalitarian.

I believe Bitcoin is God's gift to capitalism. With a trustless protocol like Bitcoin we don't have to resort to these political virtue signaling but let the market decide.

"You make some very good points.  

I think a lot of that 'running before we can walk' comes from an older generation that were the first tinkerers in cyberspace having to work alongside a younger generation that can't remember the world before a fully formed internet...

Heck, Daniel Buchner (head of Microsoft Decentralised Identity) was, ironically, working at Mozilla in the middle of the 'browser' wars that culminated in the famous Microsoft antitrust cases (their intention was to use windows to ""cut off Netscape's air supply"").  Bill and co. just saw the internet as a new business vertical to be exploited, and didn't care much for the ""information wants to be free"" ethos that lead to Tim Berners-Lee giving it to the world without a patent.

Whilst I understand the excitement of many in this space enjoying their first flush of success on the internet, there are many experienced techies behind the scenes who are approaching all this with considerably more caution... many see history rhyming, and are loathed to repeat the same past mistakes.

I bring up Daniel btw, because he has been rather vocal in expressing his opposition to competing alts like BCH and has firmly stated that the only blockchain of interest to him at Microsoft is the one that remains most decentralised and resistant to hostile takeover (in other words, bitcoin).  His history at Mozilla during those browser wars gives him invaluable experience that means we ought pay attention to some of the wisdom he gleaned during those years. 

Talking of experience, we forget that all the web giants who have caused so much positive disruption these past few decades (from Google to Ebay and AirBnB) have been virtually silent about all this...  Could it be they're all way ahead of the ""lambo pack"" and have been diligently working alongside the 1000+ other coders who have been tinkering with [Sidechain Elements Alpha](https://www.elementsproject.org/sidechains/alpha/) and other Layer 2/3 initiatives for the 3 years? ;)

"First things first, since we have an example security failure, let's first take that apart.

The evidence indicates that Ballina was spearfished. They then used social engineering to change his password to one of their choosing.

That is how security really fails. 

Now let's start going through this massive pile of horrible advice.

&gt; ▪️ **Are you using a cold storage to store your crypto, meaning do you own a Trezor/Ledger to store your crypto?** 

Good advice.

&gt;
&gt;**If NO, buy atleast 2 of them IMMEDIATELY. Keep one as backup in case one gets stolen or lost.

If your hardware supports using a second one as a backup, you don't have hardware security. 

It does however make sense to have a recovery process where m of n devices are necessary. 

&gt;
&gt; ▪️Is **your password for all of your logins complex and greater than 32+ characters including a capital letter, lower case letter, numbers, and special characters?**
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;If NO, make sure your passwords for your email, comptuer login, and any other important logins fit this criteria.

This is awful advice, with no connection to relax security at all. Seriously it has absolutely no connection to reality at all.

The Ballina hack is a perfect example of how this advice has no connection to reality. The attackers didn't guess his password, they exploited the password reset system that Google out in place because stupid people pick passwords they can't remember. The actual password he used made exactly 0 difference to them.

The real advice is to keep sensitive information off systems someone else controls. What Ballina did was hand his wallet to Google and trust them.

&gt;
&gt; ▪️**Whenever you use your computer are you logged in on a reputable VPN service like NordVPN with CyberSec enabled?**

If YES, you're simply wrong about the threats. 

This simply does not address any valid threat, but does create centralization threats, this is the opposite of good advice.

To see why, let's look at how this completely fails to prevent an attack, and instead makes it easier.

Villainous Scum sends a spearfishing contact to Ballin Ballina. The VPN does nothing.

It looks like a good site to BB. VPN only gives BB more confidence in his security.

BB sends his information to VS. VPN does nothing to prevent this.

VS uaes this information to highjack BB's account. The VPN doesn't even see this happening.

The VPN only serves to make you feel more secure it does not increase security.

Worse, it reduces security.

Villainous Scum only has to compromise a single location, probably tricking then through directed DNS poisoning. Now since BB and all the other CryptoKiddies use that VPN the value of the attack has been amplified.

So it does not offer any protection from attacks, and at the same time makes viable attacks more valuable.

&gt; ▪️**Is your computer free of viruses and malware? Are you using the latest security systems to prevent attacks like this? Do you have a realtime and automatically updated anti virus on your system?**
&gt;
&gt;** If NO, stop being cheap and go to www.bitdefender.com and buy a subscription to protect your computer from malicious attacks.

Good advice.

&gt; ▪️**Does your mobile phone carrier have security settings to prevent your phone from being ported etc?**

Yes or no makes no difference. Quit handing random companies your wallet and simply believing they'll keep it safe.

&gt;
&gt;** If NO or if you don't have a clue what I am talking about, call your mobile phone carrier ASAP and tell them you want to SIM lock your phone (so no one can transfer your number) and also port freeze your phone line (so no one can forward your number to another number.) Also, ask them to setup a pin to make any and all changes to your account.

Every piece of this is bullshit to make you feel better.

It fails in exactly the same way as before, Villainous Scum yses social engineering, and your phone carrier protects their brand.

The real answer is stop trusting random companies with your wallet.

&gt;
&gt; ▪️**Are you practicing common sense?**

If you're following your own advice, then no.

&gt;
&gt;** Don't click on links in your emails. 

Decent advice, effectively impossoble to follow, but decent advice.

&gt; Always double check usernames and where emails are coming from.

Trivially faked.

&gt; ▪️**Where are you keeping your seed recovery keys for your wallet? Who knows where they are?**

Your recovery key belongs only one place: a safe deposit box in a bank. The only other option involves a platoon of Marines, I'll assume you can't afford that.

Bonus: you can actually tell people where they are for things like inheritance.

&gt; ▪️**Are you showing off your profits and portfolio to people?**
&gt;
&gt;** If YES, think twice about who you show it to and where you are posting it. Your closest friends can be your biggest enemies. People are snakes. There are bad people out there always plotting ways to get something out of you. Always assume that - and don't fucking post your portfolio online. You are asking to get tied up to a chair in a dark basement and tortured. 

Also known as the make sure you cower in fear approach to life.

For those of you that want to actually have a life this is obviously horrible advice.

&gt; ▪️**Are you traveling a lot?** 

More cower in fear.

&gt; ▪️**Are you protecting yourself from danger?**
&gt;

And more cower in fear.

The absolute best advice anyone can give you on security is don't panic. If you look like prey, you're prey.

&gt;▪️**Are you keeping most or more than $10,000 of your crypto on any exchanges while you are not actively trading?**
&gt;
&gt;** Honestly, WTF are you doing and WHY are you doing this if the answer is yes to this question. 

Follow that advice.

For the real security that you need everything is very simple. Hardware security bests software security every single time. Anything not in your hardware wallet is at risk, make sure it is actively making you money. Your paper recovery for your wallet belongs in a safe deposit box. Don't look like prey. ",1523928185

There are plenty of sketchy practices in crypto, but pulling off a major scam on a privacy-focused coin community when your real name and face are plastered all over social media is tantamount to trying to pickpocket a mob boss in broad daylight.

&gt; Again, read the entire post. The holy partnership probably isn't Ledger integration. The way they're pumping the event, it's probably something entirely different. Hardware wallet integration is just something that's been on the roadmap for a while. ",1523927940

Better is a subjective word. It totally depends on what the individual values most. Is it security? Speed? Fees? Decentralization? Ease of use? Enterprise adoption? Bitcoin has perhaps the best balance out of cryptocurrencies but many alts would rate higher in specific attributes. You know in video games when you get 100 points to spread across attributes? It almost reminds me of that, it's possible to be better in speed and ease of use but that typically makes it lack in decentralization. It's easy to be low in fees, but typically at the expense of securing the network. BTC has a good balance of all the attributes but only really stands out in decentralization and security.

Many breakthrough technologies were not taken to the finish line by the architects behind them. Netscape was a pioneer but didn't end up winning the race, others took the ideas behind the breakthrough tech and adapted it. There are tons of examples of this, inventors making incredible technologies and having others take them further before they even really take off. I don't personally see anything wrong with that, especially with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general being open source. Others may have different takes on how it should be implemented and I don't think there is anything wrong with them attempting their own variations despite the fact that BTC hasn't started ""running"" yet. They may have different ideas on how things should be, but at this point as long as they aren't ripping people off I think it's too soon to say that the only way to do cryptocurrency right is BTC.

"&gt;A network where the third parties have to prove to a gatekeeper that they are known and legal entities falls on the centralized side of the line separating decentralized and centralized applications.

&gt;Even if the gatekeeper didn't exist, the fact that coin holders would be voting the delegates in would mean that the delegates would have to already have significant reputations, and be known and trusted, to stand any chance of getting elected.

You're wrong there. Blockchains are politically and architecturally decentralized, but logically centralized. And decentralization DOES NOT mean any man or his dog has the right to contribute to the network. You are mixing facts and logic with ideology if you think this is the case. 

*Architectural (de)centralization — how many physical computers is a system made up of? How many of those computers can it tolerate breaking down at any single time?

Political (de)centralization — how many individuals or organizations ultimately control the computers that the system is made up of?

Logical (de)centralization— does the interface and data structures that the system presents and maintains look more like a single monolithic object, or an amorphous swarm? One simple heuristic is: if you cut the system in half, including both providers and users, will both halves continue to fully operate as independent units?*

source - https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274

What this means is that it doesn't matter if the legal entities, corporations or whatever nodes get voted in are, as long as they are different to the others it still contributes to decentralization. Just because some random can't run their own node cause they won't get voted in, doesn't mean its not decentralized! The network still maintains the main reasons for decentralization, fault tolerance, attack resistance and collusion resistance. Whether a single individual or group of people can or cannot be a delegate has nothing to do with what actual decentralization means.

Sure the NEO council currently owns most of the tokens, but they are slowly releasing them over time as the network becomes more and more decentralized. They are smart, they want the network to grow slowly and organically. Once they have relinquished control of their share of tokens they will be just another node running on the network, no gatekeeping required, with all token holders voting in new delegates. This will actually be much more decentralized than what BTC and ETH are with their mining pools that own so much hashpower

It appears that the Iranian people are losing trust in the rial as it continues to depreciate in value. In response, the government of Iran is trying to prevent them from getting their hands on foreign currency, providing another example of the need for bitcoin. We should expect to see a growth in local bitcoin use as this situation develops, just as has happened in Venezuela and elsewhere.


No More Currency Exchange Shops

The Central Bank of Iran (CBI) has announced a ban on the trading of foreign currencies by individuals and companies at private exchanges across the country. According to local news reports, forex exchanges in Iran are now only allowed to buy or sell gold coins “until further notice.”

Mohammad Ali Karimi, head of public relations for CBI, reportedly said on Iranian television on April 13 that the new government guidelines are meant to “redefine the job description of exchange bureaus.” He added that instead of buying and selling fiat, the exchanges “might be given the role of a mediator for cases when Iranian banks are not interacting with some foreign banks.” It is possible that the CBI sees the move as a temporary emergency measure due to rapid decline of the rial, however the fact that money changers are offered a new role suggests that the central bank expects this to last at least for a while.

Police to Enforce Exchange Rate

Ferdowsi street, Tehran

The move to “redefine” how Iranians can buy foreign currencies came soon after the government set a new official exchange rate last week. The CBI also announced a €10,000 ceiling on the amount of foreign currency that citizens of Iran can hold outside banks. Those moves reportedly caused people to flock to exchange shops, only to find out they have no money to trade as the CBI did not transfer them any.

In order to enforce the new fixed rate, the police were out in force on the streets, according to local reports, to deter anyone from trading at underground or black-market prices. And the Tehran police revealed that it arrested a dozen “currency market schemers.” One religious leader, Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi, has even called for money changers to be killed. “In order to teach a lesson, we should execute, according to Islamic rules, a few foreign exchange traders who try to plunge the country into chaos,” he was quoted by Iranian media.

Arresting currency traders in Iran is nothing new these days.

Bitcoin clogged up when Wall Street entered and tried using on chain transactions.

Now that Wall Street has exited the scene for a moment, things have cooled down and Bitcoin is fully functional again. 

Once LN is fully operational and has the bugs worked out, wall street is gonna flood the cryptosphere with money. But it will do it through the LN channels with compatible coins.

"&gt; Why is this? Max block size just means the maximum size.

Not in Segwit enabled Bitcoin it doesn't.  The MAX_BLOCK_SIZE constant doesn't even exist in the source code anymore; it now uses MAX_BLOCK_WEIGHT which has different ramifications.

&gt; A full segwit 4mb block has 1/2 the transactions of a full 8mb BCH block.

Completely untrue.  Bitcoin (BTC) still has a 1MB limit on the amount of non-witness data that can be included in a block, which means that in order for a 4MB sized block to be produced, the transactions have to have a 3 to 1 ratio of witness to non-witness data.  This restriction constrains the amount and type of transactions that can be used to produce a 4MB block.

Here is a (testnet) example of a 3.7MB Segwit block, with fewer than 500 transactions:

https://testnet.smartbit.com.au/block/00000000000016a805a7c5d27c3cc0ecb6d51372e15919dfb49d24bd56ae0a8b

Note, I'm not saying that Segwit blocks can't have more transactions than non-segwit blocks, I'm saying that describing Segwit as a 4MB block size increase is misleading, due to restrictions that limit what type and amount of transactions can actually go into a 4MB block.

Had Segwit been introduced to Bitcoin as a hard fork, what you are claiming may have been true (since there would likely be fewer restrictions on how the non-witness data were formulated to match consensus).

&gt; When/If a fork happens, the new coin will not be Bitcoin, because it won't work with Satoshi's client.

Then there is debate as to whether the current BTC chain is Bitcoin, as it's not obvious (for example) that pre-v0.8.1 versions of the client can be considered compatible with the chain.  Nevertheless, I personally don't agree that a hard fork necessarily defines a new currency.",1523925781

"Naaah, I'll bet Ripple over Ethereum or any other blockchain tech in crypto for that matter. Ripple is so far beyond everybody else in this space is laughable. NO OTHER blockchain organization/foundation can lay claim to Ripple's level of adoption in any industry especially the global financial community as a whole……. NONE!!! While most can only speak of ""collaborations"" and ""proofs-of-concept."" Ripple can actually show evidence and provide proof of how they are solving their ""ACTUAL"" customers problems.  “Surveying the market, Ripple was the only company that has delivered battle-tested enterprise solutions and global bank customer traction, including commercial deals with top banks already signed in Asia Pacific,” said President and CEO of SBI Holdings Yoshitaka Kitao. “Distributed financial technology is undoubtedly transforming financial infrastructure and we’re excited to drive its adoption throughout Asia” (https://ripple.com/ripple_press/ripple-strikes-multi-national-deal-with-sbi-holdings-to-meet-growing-demand-for-ripple-solutions-across-asia/).


Ethereum's broad adoption is primarily from ICOs and the question that oftentimes come to mind is how many of those ICOs are going to fail as a result of no defined use-case, lack of vision and focus, poor leadership, etc? I believe while this a-la-carte ICO market has been very lucrative for Ethereum in the short-term it may ultimately cause its downfall. The fact that Ethereum has yet to find a viable solution to the network’s scaling and technical issues is still the ELEPHANT in the room (https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-time-highs-overshadow-wave-technical-issues/). It is evident that Vitalik realizes that a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus model is not robust or dynamic enough to scale appropriately. He has recently started a ‘scalability initiative’ in attempts to solicit help from the broader developer community to assist with Ethereum’s scalability issues caused by the ever backlog of Cryptokitties, Etherbots, and ICOs clogging the network (https://blog.ethereum.org/2018/01/02/ethereum-scalability-research-development-subsidy-programs/). According to Vitalik, scaling Ethereum’s network “is the single most important key technical challenge that developers need to work on before blockchain applications can be widely used.” The folks at Ethereum have even gone as far as changing the consensus model from a PoW to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) strategy called Casper (https://www.coindesk.com/ethereums-big-switch-the-new-roadmap-to-proof-of-stake/). However, as has been pointed out in Ripple’s new whitepaper regarding the newly proposed XRP-Consensus Ledger replacement consensus: 'Cobalt: BFT Governance in Open Networks,' there are inherent flaws with a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus model (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.07240.pdf Pgs: 10-11).


In addition to the ICO/Tokens that plague ETH network that I mentioned earlier, you have the resurgence of Ripple’s smart contract platform called Codius that will be revamped and rolled-out this year. According to Stefan Thomas (Ripple’s CTO) who said in a Quora Q&amp;A session (https://www.quora.com/session/Stefan-Thomas-1/1), “I worked on Ripple’s smart contract system Codius back in 2013–2015. Back then, our conclusion was that a viable smart contracts ecosystem requires a standard for payments first. Contracts need to be reviewed to be trusted and that’s expensive if you need a new contract for each type of asset because every ledger has a different protocol/API. Thus, Interledger was born.” Smart contracts have been the backbone and life-blood of Ethereum’s existence for the better part of the past +3 years. I think we can expect great things for Codius especially since it will be built on Ripple’s Interledger Protocol. While Ripple might not have had sufficient “bandwidth” to fully commit to Codius development early on, due to the focus on the development of its blockchain solutions (xCurrent/xRapid/xVia/ILP), it is my belief that they have been quietly working on it behind the scenes for a while now.

"1.) Turn off the computer
2.) Remove the drive.  You'll probably have to go to an apple store to do this for a fee.  Have them put in a new drive.
3.) Download paid software which does a read-only recovery of the drive.  When a disk deletes a file it normally just marks it deleted, but the more time that passes, the more likely it is that your files are gone.  SSD's have internal firmware that moves bits of data around in order to not wear out a single spot on the drive, so your chances are not as good with SSD, but still possible. Also, I recommend attempting a recovery on your own, because sending it off to some random nerd for data recovery could get your key stolen if even if the data is recovered.
4.) If all else fails, take it to a professional as a last resort.

Only try this if you did not already explicitly do a full reformat.  Even a quick reformat will leave data there, and if it's a magnetic disk then it takes multiple reformat and writes to completely erase all traces of data.

Up until Bitcoin there were no decentralized investment vehicles/currencies, does that mean everything up until that point was a scam?

Scam gets thrown around way too much. You personally dont believe coins that run on less decentralization than BTC serve any purpose, while millions of other people disagree. You are using your own personal definitions to label things scams. Under your criteria basically every company is a scam.

"I finished my Master's degree the year after the 2008 financial crisis and read a lot about it at the time. I learned how the federal reserve and banks manipulated the financial sector for their benefit. However, the worst part was that these tactics the financial system less stable and dangerous for everyone else. This was compounded with inefficient government spending, quantitative easing, inflated markets, and insane levels of debt (consumer, student, national, etc.) I saw that our biggest hurdle as a generation would be to reclaim control and stability over financial systems.

I learned about cryptocurrency and BTC in 2013. I found the concept and technology fascinating--it had the potential to lead to real community-led solutions for our financial woes. But I also saw how unstable and early it was, so I didn't have the guts to invest yet (I was also early in my career and was trying to get debt free). I watched the Mt. Gox fiasco and thought this might be it, it's over. I kept tabs on the price every couple months, just out of curiosity. Never put any money in, despite some occasional temptation.

In 2017, I learned about other cryptos (Ethereum, mostly) and regained interest. I was intimidated by the high market caps -- after all, these coins still weren't being used, *really*. I waited and waited, kept researching until the December run. The more I learned, the more I realized how:

1) Market caps don't accurately represent the value of the tokens

2) Crypto is here to stay, and it's only getting bigger

Then I FOMO'd in. Despite that, though, I've been lucky, and am still in the green atm. I'm staying because I still believe the solutions to our financial woes are going to come from crowd sourced decentralized tech. The leaders of our systems are incapable. They've dug us all too deep, and their interests are shortsighted and self-centered. If we're going to reclaim economic stability and control, it will come from decentralization.",1523923011

"Very well said, from each angle. 

I agree with you for the most part. 

The part I don't entirely agree with:
&gt; I think far more businesses would prefer decentralization/immutability over centralization/mutability. We already have centralized/mutable options on the market. 

There are absolutely a ton of businesses that would prefer 'a platform where you can rely on never locking you out or raising fees on you at the best of its proprietor.' I do agree that there are many, but I feel that most larger businesses would prefer something like NEO's blockchain as opposed to Ethereum - specially because things are more controlled. 

I am part of the community that understands that decentrazation is all 'the people have' to take the power back from governments and institutions; but the best part about this all is that NEO's community can still mass exodus over to any blockchain they so choose to support if NEO begins to not act in the best interest of the community. Though, those decentralized blockchains will still exist at the point of a mass exodus from NEO and, in that case, Ethereum would actually benefit far more than NEO. 

This might be NEO's way of getting ahead of Ethereum for a short-time, maybe, but Ethereum has pretty powerful Venture Capitalists backing many, many projects being developed on that side of crypto. I think NEO will be a big competitor to Ethereum, creating healthy competition that only forces Ethereum to forge a better product than NEO.

If you're right and NEO does leave holes for corruption in their 'decentralization process,' we should know pretty quickly as there are many eyes on the network. I'm very wary of this and will continue paying close attention - something else that will happen, if you are correct, is that NEO will just be another centralized network that the community will know is corrupt or vulnerable to corruption and, in that case, opt for a decentralized public chain like Ethereum. 

And obviously a vast majority of businesses would not want to be censored/screwed by the person running the platform so they would likely quickly notice a disruption to their business if this is to happen. 

If you're right and this turns out to be a bad-apple-chain, I have faith that true decentralization will prevail in the various other communities working on  blockchains :) ",1523922209

"I've been invested in ECC since January and new to Crypto. I am very wary of scam coins and I would never place an investment in one.  At the time I invested, it was difficult to find any info on ECC.  There were only a few articles I found with limited info, the website was old, and it was difficult to find info on the dev team.

I went to great lengths to find the information I needed to be comfortable enough to buy ECC, more than most people would.

Fortunately, there is much more information available today, including the video.  So in an effort to take your concerns head-on, I am going to address them as best I can.

1.  This coin has been around since 2014, I think there are a couple of developers working on it.

While many people feel that a coin which has been around since 2014, abandoned and then picked up by a part-time developer as a red flag, I see the exact opposite.  Especially since that part-time developer has turned into a 7 to 9 person dev team with a full-time lead developer.   While many of the devs are part-time, they are putting in significant time every day which they do because they believe in ECC.  

Members of this dev team have also donated their own money beyond their time to move this project forward.

There are community members who have been around since 2014 who have made investments of time and money to support ECC.  They are active and willing to donate more money to help advance this coin moving forward.

Since January, there has been a large influx of people who have joined the community and are actively working to help move this project forward.   This new surge has helped ECC expand its team and create more transparency, an example of which is a weekly post on Medium called The Weekly Standup.  The Stand up informs the community on the most recent news and updates on the project.  You can read the most recent standup at https://medium.com/@project_ecc/weekly-dev-stand-up-apr-15-2018-957b0bd232c9

The video, which seems like an expensive production and put doubts in your mind was the work of new community members who have partnered with ECC to build greater awareness and understanding of ECC.

I have personally experienced an extremely transparent community where the devs have regular and meaningful exchanges with others in the community.  They are active in the slack group and you can follow their updates to code on Github.

The Lead Developer has cut his teeth working on BCH among other projects and has clearly put a lot of thought into how to develop this project for long-term success and not short-term gain. 

3. It's difficult to buy and the exchanges seem sketchy.

Coin Exchange and Cryptobridge, the only two exchanges where you can buy ECC each have their own challenges.  The latter has such low volume that I never bothered to try it and the former felt kinda sketchy.  

That said, I have found Coin Exchange to be a fairly easy exchange to use and I have not run into any problems with it, nor do I know of anyone in the community who has had any issues.  Is it the best platform? No, but it is serviceable if you want to buy the coin.

4. The wallet is slow to load.

I've heard talk about how long it has taken people to load the old wallet.    I was able to load mine in less than 8 hours and once it was synced, I was able to move my coins into my wallet without any issues.   The community is very helpful and responsive to anyone who runs into issues and has put together a lot of good information for people to follow when questions pop up.  Plus there have been updates to the wallet that have been addressing these issues.

Sapphire is being released to bring about a better and more seamless user experience from a new wallet to services such as ANS, messaging, and file storage.  I don't know what this will look like but we will know very shortly whether Sapphire is as good as planned.  The only thing I can say is that the team has put forth a tremendous effort to create a great product and the community is very excited about it.

I think every coin has people that over hype it and are unrealistically positive about the coin and ECC is no exception but I will also say that the community at large is focused on supporting a team that is working hard to create some very good and needed services using Blockchain.

If you take the time to observe how the team works and the slow but steady progress of this coin, it's hard to not be impressed with what they are creating.  Whether that brings great success down the road or not is something for each person to decide for themselves.  

I invested because in my mind, the focus and effort of this team are real and I think it's worth the risk, in fact, I think the risk is much lower than most coins out there today.  You can decide for yourself but hopefully you find this feedback helpful.

"Ah the Twitter troll @_Emanuel_Neves and the others.   Anyone looking enough will see through your tweets and your attempts at hateful behaviour through your 2 month twitter history. Seems like your Hevel startup is just trying to get off the ground, how do you even have the time? Why act like this to a fellow Torontonian team?  Personal vendetta you said right?

Not sure what we did to you but you seem very vindictive in your efforts.  This constant harassment of our team, partners and social media accounts is just sad really.  The amount of time you put in here could be done living a healthier life.  Why go so out of your way unless there is some underlying issues you have not dealt with?  Please get help as the evidence of your hateful, sexist, racist, and worse tweets show an unfulfilled person.    

Anyways I have to thank you.  You're bringing more exposure to our innovative company and mission with your work.  It's like you're an extended alt-ambassador of our team.  People like you just make people like us work harder to achieve our goals.  What is that goal?  Bring cash to crypto conversions to local areas globally just to start.  We've been in this industry for more than 6 years, we're not going anywhere.  No matter what you say or what you do, time is on our side.  Through dedicated work our entire 50+ team members, and hundreds of thousands of users globally will provide a much needed distributed fiat infrastructure for the blockchain industry as a whole.  The banks are already removing exchanges and other industry businesses as clients.  What happened in China, is now happening in India.  Cash will be the only solution.  We already have tons of software updates partnerships in the funnel that will deploy this summer.  

Thanks again for the publicity.  The real people will see through your garbage eventually.  I applaud your continued determination and efforts.  Our team will continue to deal with it as we usually do.  Keep building and growing.  ",1523920560

"&gt; It's a bit unfair to credit only Rust and Ristretto with the speedup [...]

I apologize for the incomplete title for this reddit submission. In the blog post we specifically mention that the bulk of speedup is due to AVX2, although even without it, using Rust, Edwards25519 and 64-bit arithmetic with 128-bit products is giving a significant speed up.

&gt; [...] some comes from the fact that the Ristretto benchmarks start from proofs represented by full points rather than compressed ones, both of which result in unfair comparisons

The reason we take uncompressed points is to keep the implementation cleaner. As of fairness, the points are being compressed when fed to the transcript, which has approximately the same cost as uncompressing them. Meaning, if we got compressed points, we'd pay cost of uncompressing them, but would use the compressed bytes as-is in the transcript, so the overall cost would be the same. I agree that the most clean way would be to have compressed points on the input, and we are going to do exactly that, after we figure out how to make the API and code around that look not awful :) However, I don't think this would affect the results even by 1%. But thanks for calling this out!

&gt; I think the authors weaken their claim by conflating the speedup from hardware accelleration with the speedup from their own optimizations

I don't think it makes a lot of sense to separate AVX2 out of the rest of the parts that allow for the performance. E.g. 64-bit arithmetic with 128-bit products also gives a considerable speedup and may count as ""hardware acceleration"" as well. And the point of using Edwards curve in the first place is to be able to use the simpler and parallelizable formulas, so it makes sense to actually do so if we can.

&gt; This is especially impressive because the underlying crypto primitive library, curve25519-dalek, actually has worse performance than libsecp for both scalar operations and batch scalar-point multiplying.

Is it the case even with the `nightly` feature? Bulletproofs library turns it on automatically, but curve25519-dalek does not, so if you don't specify it explicitly, it'll use 32-bit arithmetic instead of the 64-bit one. 

(Note to readers: the reason Andy was getting worse performance on curve25519-dalek vs Bulletproofs library is because of the above `nightly` flag that's on by default within BP and off by default in curve25519-dalek. Sorry for the confusion!)",1523920495

"Lightning network from an engineering standpoint is a nightmare compared to nano. Hindsight is a massive advantage and the nano developers had hindsight of bitcoin throughout their entire process. Bitcoin adding another layer on top of itself probably cannot match a technology that was built from the ground up with hindsight in mind.

If the above statement isn't true then why try to make anything better? Why aren't we using chariot wheels on our cars? 

That being said I don't think that nano will surpass bitcoin. Even if bitcoin took 5 hours to transfer it still has a very important place and is useful for transferring large amounts of money. Nano on the other hand could be useful for small or very small transfers of money, quickly. You could always convert nano and bitcoin back and forth, lightning network is going to be unnecessary, and it won't be better at nano for transferring very small amounts of money. It just won't.

"**Web of trust**

In cryptography, a web of trust is a concept used in PGP, GnuPG, and other OpenPGP-compatible systems to establish the authenticity of the binding between a public key and its owner. Its decentralized trust model is an alternative to the centralized trust model of a public key infrastructure (PKI), which relies exclusively on a certificate authority (or a hierarchy of such). As with computer networks, there are many independent webs of trust, and any user (through their identity certificate) can be a part of, and a link between, multiple webs.

The web of trust concept was first put forth by PGP creator Phil Zimmermann in 1992 in the manual for PGP version 2.0:



As time goes on, you will accumulate keys from other people that you may want to designate as trusted introducers.

It can be argued that miners could choose to mine the second transaction if the fees were much higher than the first (only an hypothesis, this never happened on BCH because blocks are empty and fees low but happens all the time on BTC) and it doesn't even make economical sense for small amounts because you can't pay much of a bigger fee.

You're right, that is exactly what I am saying. Satoshi invented Bitcoin, right? Well Satoshi's client works on Bitcoin and not Bitcoin Cash. When/If a fork happens, the new coin will not be Bitcoin, because it won't work with Satoshi's client. 

Bitcoin will always be the older chain that remains compatible with BTC. A forked coin with a bigger block size will not be Bitcoin, it will be a fork, because there is no way to do that without creating a new currency.

They can't compete with miners, so they'll run sidechains of one form or another. Blockstream has promised their investors ""Unicorn-like returns"" on investment. The only way they can promise that is by having some scheme to transfer fees from miners to themselves. Their answer is some form of 2nd layer that they can reap fees from, either Lightning, Liquid, or elsewise.

But one thing is clear, Blockstream cannot reap fees from on-chain transactions. So their goal is to shift transaction fees from the on-chain network where transaction fees go to miners, to 2nd layer solutions that they and their allies can participate in reaping fees.",1523918648

"INTRODUCTION
At present, the cryptocurrency market is relatively small as a comparison to the world
amount of trade in traditional currencies, with the daily volume trading at FOREX market
assessed at 5.1 trillion USD. Even with the current development rate of 1,500 cryptocurrencies
and a market cap of $400 billion, the possibilities of rapid growth present massive opportunities
to serve within an exchange market over the next 2-3 years. Present exchanges that exist in the
marketplace have struggled to keep up with this explosive growth and extraordinary demand
from the hundreds of thousands of new market entrants. In December 2017, some of the
largest cryptocurrency exchanges, paused the onboarding for new users, presenting an
opportunity for the development of WORLDEX to further serve existing and new traders.
WHAT IS WORLDEX
WORLDEX is a platform created for the democratization and development of
crypto trading. In an effort to solve many of the problems that exist in current exchanges the
a team of visionaries and developers set out a goal to dissect the top open-source codebase
(order books, payment gateways, functional scripts, library codes) for functionalities and
security to advance and develop a proprietary modern, yet simple to use the platform. The
knowledge portal will provide a wide range of opportunities for sharing experience and ideas:
streaming of trades, social trading contribution, analytics of recent activities, spotlight on
successful investment strategies, and access to opinion leaders and experts in the world of
cryptocurrency as an unbiased source. The platform will ensure instantaneous mutual swap of
cryptocurrencies within a safe and efficient marketplace.

Look at the Bitcoin Network right now, plenty of room in the blocks, the fees are mere cents and it transacts quickly. Right now, 4-16-18!  With the LN, its just gonna have more room to breathe.

"Here's [a nice read](https://medium.com/@jimmysong/why-bitcoin-is-different-e17b813fd947) from Bitcoin Developer Jimmy Song who explains it all rather eloquently.

This part in particular, is well argued:

&gt;""Every cryptocurrency and ICO other than Bitcoin is centralized. For an ICO, this is obvious. The entity that issues the ICO and creates the token is the centralized party. They issued the coin and thus can change the token’s usage, alter the coin’s incentives or issue additional tokens. They can also refuse to accept certain tokens for their good or service.""

&gt;""Altcoins have the same problem, though not in such an obvious way. Usually the creator is the de facto dictator for the coin and can do the same things that a government can. Taxes (dev tax, storage tax, etc), inflation, picking winners and losers (DAO, proof-of-X change, etc) are often decided by the creators. As a holder of an altcoin, you have to trust not just the current leader, but all future leaders of the coin to not confiscate, tax away or inflate away your coins. In other words, altcoins and ICOs are not qualitatively different than fiat. In altcoin and ICO-land, you are not sovereign over your own coins!""

"You are missing many things.

1.that where I spent that BCH they do not take LN. You are also missing that BCH has always been extremly cheap to get into the next block, whereas BTC-fees have risen above what I consider acceptable some time in mid-2017 and became completly unusable at the end of 2017.

2.BCH forked way before the catastrophe of fees reached its climax

3. a system that gives incentives to be spammed will be spammed and a non-spam resistant system is just not good enough.

4.So it cost you 0.04 is 0.04 greater than 0

5.&gt;When roger and his chinese mining cartel buddies were spamming the blockchain for a few months in preperation

I mean I would like to see proof...

6.&gt;Its just not true that bch is cheaper any more. 
It is however if you are not using LN and additionally I just do not want to deal with another effective live-ness failure as existed in the last december. 

7.Tbh the difference between 1c/tx and 0c/tx  might be big in % but it is only 1c. So I am likely not going to switch back to BTC even if the LN starts to 1. work and 2. get adoption.

"I think you are the one that does not want it to succeed. What crypto needs is adoption, a widespread use. This is where its value would come from, from usefulness. You want everyone to own some and slowly drive its value up. Whole 2017 was a bull run that only hurt it. It attracted day traders, and bots, that increased volatility and concentrated crypto in quite small number of wallets that can shake the market. It made Bitcoin a store of value, a speculative asset, not a currency. It's like gold now, and can you pay for anything with gold directly today?

"&gt; Fractional banking isn't perfect, but by and large, it works and it works extremely well. You cannot sustain the type of growth the world has seen over the past 500 years without it

This is a flawed premise. Most ""Golden Ages"" of innovation and discovery in human history happened when a civilisation had sound money. 

2007-2008 in the States revealed that when you don't anchor currency to a sound store of value, the bailout money ended up inflating the money supply, so your whatever you had in savings will be worth less after the bailout. If you were rich enough to have investments, those grew proportionally with bailout money, so you have [all time highs in traditional investments](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/get-there/wp/2018/01/05/stocks-are-at-an-all-time-high-is-it-too-late-to-get-in-on-the-action/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.f2347c46bc15). The bankers got to continue doing what they did, but this time with inflated money supply, and rinse and repeat. Rich keeps getting richer, poor gets poorer. Losses are socialised while gains are privatised.

But I'm Canadian, and all countries run on the same centralised private banking system. It's even worse here, and I would know because I consult on public health expenditure in Canada . Housing is unaffordable in major cities, cost of living keeps getting higher and higher. Canada has 0% fractional reserve requirement. Canada began phasing out cash reserve requirement in 1992 and removed it in 1994. If you are interested, see BOC Working Paper 97-8 (April 1997) ""Implementation of Monetary Policy in a Regime with Zero Reserve Requirements"" by Kevin Clinton.

We were supposed to implement Basel III capital rules. This is a voluntary global framework to create a better monetary system, and although sources claim that Canada has taken steps to follow suite, this hasn't happened in practice.

I have a colleague who was tasked with estimating the necessary healthcare resources required to treat our growing senior population. We spent $144 billion in publicly funded healthcare in 2015, and that cost grew 1.4x faster than average income per year. We INCREASED our public health spending in 2018 at an estimated 1.8x rate faster than average income. That spending was $35 billion in 2002-2003. Healthcare is NOT 5x better than 2002-2003, and wages have stagnated compared to these rising healthcare costs. In 5-15 years, our healthcare system will be unsustainable from a public spending perspective, and the options are bleak. At the rate which resources are being used now, ""planned termination"" at age 75 is necessary to just maintain the status quo. Obviously planned termination is not happening. The solution would be to minimise wage/salary and automate as much as we can, but you already see organisations like OMA/CMA fighting against it. They're not going to budge, and what we see from a mile away is a catastrophic collapse of the healthcare system.

When cost of healthcare, housing, food is increasing in Canada, the [risk of revolution increases](https://www.financialsense.com/contributors/russ-winter/food-prices-riots-civil-wars). Take a look at how French Revolution happened, and at what levels on the Hunger Index triggered revolution. More recently, take a look at Nigeria, Angola, Yemen, Cameroon on the Hunger Index. As of July 7, 2017, 42.6 million Americans were receiving SNAP benefits during the current fiscal year, down from 44.2 million in 2016. The 2017 figure is the lowest since 2010, when 40.3 million people were on food stamps. The number peaked in 2013, at 47.6 million. Look at all the data and draw your own conclusions. Things are NOT ok.

&gt; The same goes for interest rates. Without the ability to adjust interest rates, a modern central bank is entirely ineffective at managing and stabilizing an economy.

That's untrue as well. Banks react slowly to the market with incomplete information. A free market can establish rates dynamically without central authority.

&gt; Generations of policy makers, economists, and other academics have studied this and don't have a viable alternative.

"No doubt the blockchain technology that gave rise to Bitcoin has ushered in a whole new industry around digital securities/assets allowing the transfer of digital property/value, such that the transfer is guaranteed to be safe and secure. With that being said, I highly doubt that the majority of folks coming into the crypto space of recent days is because of Bitcoin. I think we beginning to see the rise of the ALTs come into focus. IMHO, those spikes in Bitcoin's valuation is due to the fact that Bitcoin continue to serve as the the de-facto base/exchange currency at a majority of crypto exchanges based solely on the fact that it was the first to the market.  The stragle-hold Bitcoin currently has in that regard is  discipating as more versitile, faster, and cheaper, ALTs like XRP, XLM, and OMG move into the mainstream. Unless you got in Bitcoin prior to its run-up, I just don't see how it will compete with the afformentioned ALTs in the payments arena. It's like the Ford Model-T (Bitcoin) vs. Mercedes S65 AMG. Unless this LN network proves to be all that many have hyped it to be, I find it hard to imagine Bitcoin maintaining its coveted #1 status and valuation for very long.",1523916841

&gt; Why aren't you BCH fan boys over in r\/bch? This is BTC right!?

We don't use r\/bch because it is controlled by a party that is hostile to Bitcoin Cash. Around the time of the fork, the subreddit was tightly moderated and astroturfed to paint Bitcoin Cash in a negative light. Many Bitcoin Cash supporters - years ago, long before the name had even been floated - found themselves here [after an official statement from the founder of r\/bitcoin](https://redd.it/3h9cq4). This was only the most visible symptom of a long-standing underlying issue, which is well summarized (despite its length) in [this post chain](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/informative_btc_vs_bch_articles/dl8v4lp/).

"&gt; But ALOT less. Consumerism is a major plague

Completely true. consumerism is a major plague. But does not mean that people are poor because of consumerism. It's not true at all.

&gt; Well, if people need less and what they hold is enough, perhaps they will work less and pay less thus slowy starving the boss.

Completely false. Absolutely and utterly false. I live in an European country, devastated by austerity, where the minimum wage is less than €600 per month. Tell me. Is it possible to live with €600 per month in the USA? I think not. 

I can guarantee to you that a factory manager makes sure that every single worker will work 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. There's no thing such as *""I will work less hours because I already earn enough.""* Try to do that in a factory, and I can guarantee it to you that you will be fired in the next day. 

It's completely false that innovation and technology helps to curb this issue. It's the other way around. With our level of technology, we should have already be living by only working 5 hours a day, and yet, there's constant pressure by managers, who themselves are pressured by stock-holders, to create profit and to respond to impossible-to-meet growth demands.
These managers will tell you in the face that if you want to go anywhere in your life, family is not an option in the company. The company is your new family. They will incentivise you to live in the company. They will shove *""gamified incentives""* such has *virtual badges* so that you keep a young and naive mind, and don't notice the years passing by. Goodbye family. Goodbye society.

These stock-holders, these so called *""entrepreneurs""* who never gave a single f*ck to create a company from ground, who never worked a single f*cking day in their lives and got everything from their mommies and daddies and were born in a golden craddle, these f*ckers are the ones who want more. 
These are the ones who called themselves libertarians and fight for lower taxes. These are the ones responsible for destroying society, just to get their short-term profit. Do they need the money? NO! Why do they do it? Because these f*ckers are junkies for power. They want the power to control society. Nothing more! 

And my biggest concern is that they have already taken over the crypto currencies world and may well be the biggest whalers out there, pumping and dumping into the market, extracting liquidity and making sure that their useful idiots are out there, convincing others to HODL their coins, while sucking their money and time...

"The top reply to the Devs response:

 ""Firstly, I’m not a verge investor nor have I ever been. 

I’ve read some harsh criticisms about XVG and your team but I reserved my own judgement because I do know how irrational the crypto community can be.

But following the events in recent days, I have to admit that this whole ordeal leaves a bad taste in my mouth and I think reflects poorly on the crypto community as a whole. 

Mr. Sunerok, a lot of people have entrusted YOU with a lot of their hard earned dollars. That puts a ton of responsibility squarely in your hands. Quite frankly, you are in their pockets, sir. Yet reading all of your messages, it sounds like you‘re the one who feels somehow wronged by the community?

Your indignation and outrage towards the “trolls and fudsters” is incredibly unprofessional. People have every right to question what you say and call you out. You OWE them explanations and responses. If you think this is unusual then I suggest you look into traditional avenues for raising capital. If you think making a twitter post and answering to some pissed off redditors is an inconvenience, try dealing with a room of angel investors.

Moreover, their concerns are completely valid. You are wrong, not them. Even if your intentions are as pure as the Virgin Mary, you have to understand why the lack of candor through all of this is concerning.

First you raised funds for advertising, then said it’s to integrate with Nano; after it came out that Nano integration is free, you’re now saying that you want an individual hardware wallet and that is what the funds are for, although you aren’t talking to the Nano team about that and have no clue how much that costs. 

Again, you could very well be completely honest right now but at the same time I don’t believe you can get upset towards people. In a space where scams are rampant people deserve to be skeptical, especially after a rocky few days. 

I hope my message finds you and the verge community well. I truly want all cryptos to succeed, even ones I’m not invested in, because a win for your community is a win for crypto as a whole.

"No, they don't. That was exactly my point. 

Previously you would need a company to be able to trade without taxation on every single trade. Now, there's something called a ""stock savings account"", which is 100% free for every customer of different banks, where you can transfer funds to said account, and you only pay taxes on whatever profits you take back out of it. 

I.e, I put in $100k, bank $1m during the next 2 years. I take out $350k, pay capital gains (24%) on $250k (-1.5%), and the remaining $650k I pay no tax on. I can continue trading with that amount indefinitely. Let's push 30 years into the future. My $650k is now $650 million, because I'm somehow a trader god. The only taxes I've been paying, are 0.01% of my networth every single year. 

This is what we should be doing in crypto. 
There is absolutely no reason to subject traders to paying tax on every single god damn trade. 
Look at this complete fucking fiasco with Dec 31 2017 vs April 17 2018. Alot of people are down 65% on their portfolio since december 31st, so now they have to pay taxes on money they don't even possess anymore. This is beyond fucked up.

Of course it was my own fault that I caught the TH, but **Windows Defender** did not catch it!

* If no hardware support is available, save your private keys in an encrypted folder on two USB sticks. Remember to only connect them when you are OFFLINE

"&gt; Date the fork happened with a cost basis of $0.

There is a fundamental problem with this argument.  (A)  You owned BCH before the fork,  and should set the cost basis on the Bitcoins of $0,    OR   (B)   You owned Bitcoins before the fork,  and you should set the cost basis of the BCH to  $0.

The same arguments that would make (A)  true automatically make (B)  true,    and   it's not possible to do both!

That is it's just as much a fallacy to say you didn't have ""BCH""  until the fork,   as it is to say you didn't have  ""Bitcoins""  until the fork.

""Bitcoin Cash""  was just a name  some of the community members gave to the  value on  that version of the Bitcoin chain,  and likewise,       ""Bitcoin Core""    was the name   some gave to the other version of  the chain.

So you could say

(1) Your Bitcoin  BEFORE the fork is Not the same as  EITHER  Coin after the fork,  and,

(2) Your Bitcoin BEFORE the fork is BOTH  Coins after the fork,  and,

(3) The COST BASIS  on your asset  is   the basis for your COMBINED  value  of  BOTH  sets of coins    that you have,   and,

(4)  When you sell  one of your sets of forked coins;  You're going to need an accounting-consistent system of allocating that Combined cost basis to your sales    other than merely pretending the basis is  $0  on one of the forks.

"I was one of many on a forum called the Cheating Network who ran a *hack* for Gomez peer that allowed you to run many instances of it and get paid for running it on your PC in the background, back in 2010.

Gomez peer pays you to run their program, something like $0.001/min worth of processing time. 

I personally developed a script that would load up many instances with numerous accounts, which gave you a bonus $0.08/day/account for running it for at least an hour, but multiplied by many accounts through the day resulted in a total revenue of more than just leaving it to process data on one account all day. 

Eventually the developers caught on to our custom patch and stopped us from running more than one instance, taking earnings down from $40-50/day (depends on how much RAM you could get your hands on) to probably less than $0.2/day (I don't remember..).

Having lost a good source of revenue (for someone who worked one day a week and had numerous small SEO projects making affiliate and advertising revenue), I kept looking for a way to make money by leaving my PC to process information to replace Gomez peer, eventually finding one rather insignificant comment from a user on the same forum about Bitcoin.

I researched for a couple of months, bought a new PC and GPU and mined BTC from March/April 2011, making an average of around $3 profit a day after electricity, but as high as $20/day during peaks, but I believed that one day it would be worth a lot more.

Back then people kinda joked or talked non-seriously about BTC reach $100, $1,000 and even $10,000, but I don't think anyone really believed those figures would become real. ",1523915468

"&gt;	Regular people can send on chain transactions.

You’re utterly clueless. How the fuck are “regular people” going to transact on chain when the blocks are full? LN is inconvenient, cumbersome, and a substantial barrier to entry. Bitcoin Core couldnt even handle a small volume of speculators. How in the evee living fuck do you expect this block space to handle adoption? It cant. The only reason to even use it is for high volume, continuous transactions. Which is fine! There is a positive and beneficial use case for the lightning network *as an alternative option* to on-chain transactions. For example if you had a 32 or 64 MB block with plenty of space and no congestion, people could pick and choose which avenue they want to use to transact. **When the blocks are limited to 1MB it’s going to become expensive to transact on chain.** There is simply no way around it.",1523915377

"True. I should have said “almost nothing”. How many of those alts share some of their blockchain with Bitcoin? Bcash, Bgold, etc. all benefited from the pre-fork market cap, making it appear as if they had a high market cap. It just makes the idea of a market cap look so ridiculous, but it also shows how “value” was created out of thin air.

Sure, other coins could come along with a huge 21 trillion coin premine or whatever and can get their shitcoin listed on poloniex and sell 100 for a dollar and now they have a 210 billion dollar market cap. But that only creates new money out of nothing for the recipients of the premine.

Forks, on the other hand, create money for previous holders. That means rich get richer, and barriers to entry for the non-holders begin to grow. Large holders can sell shitforks, and buy more bitcoin, increasing demand while absorbing supply, driving up the price.

"I am a hub, because I have 4 channels to 4 other people. Does that mean I am centralized?

Well the thing with hubs, is that it does not reduce security in any way. The hub can't even see who sent the money, who receives, and can't even prove the amount. They don't know if they are part of an atomic transaction that is taking 3 routes, they are the 12th hop or if they are the only person in between, and they aren't even allowed to choose how to route transactions. It's like if you use a VPN to send encrypted data. The VPN can see how much data you send through it, but they don't know if that's all the data or even what the data is.

Unfortunately, on-chain transactions don't scale infinitely. 

The whole idea of LN is that it is as fast as centralized transactions. Like Verifone (Visa cards) payment channels, LN can handle a lot of transactions. In it's current form, it can only handle about 30% as much as Visa can, but it's improving. The brilliant part is that while Visa settles data mis-match with a centralized ledger, LN handles data mis-match with the blockchain. 

It's centralizing LN to one single entity: The blockchain, which is trustless.

The goal of LN is not to fix Bitcoin or to replace the blockchain, it's to do something the Blockchain was not meant to do. Visa handles an average of 24,000 transactions per second, 85,000 at peak, and a minimum of 17,000 per second. Lightning will be able to handle this, while remaining trustless with no way to shut it down, or to steal funds, while remaining trustless.

Neither Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash will EVER be able to handle this many transactions. A second layer solution is the only way.

I truly believe that Bitcoin Cash is better than Bitcoin, and if it wasn't for the bullshit the community has been doing to destroy it, I would have continued using it. Choosing FlexTrans over Segwit was done as a statement, even though the 2 are very similar,  but Segwit is better. Bitcoin Cash got FlexTrans. But refuses to implement LN. I think Bitcoin Cash with a LN would have been better, especially with the atomic transactions. Atomic Transactions allow you to pay a BCH address with BTC, and a BTC address with BCH, completely trustless, by exchanging at the lowest price available on the network. 

I use LN to buy mexican food at Albertos, and I like it. I am in California, the tech capital of the country, so there are plenty of places here. I like that it is instant and works the same as a BTC wallet. I can just scan the QR code on the screen, and it automatically pays the correct amount, confirms in under 3 seconds, and I pay a 2-6 satoshi fee, which is next to nothing. 

But I think that even if LN can handle 100,000 transactions per second, it's important to increase the block size to allow more people to cheaply open and close channels. The current 4MB blocks with Segwit aren't enough, and neither are Bitcoin Cash's. 16mb would probably do, although a 5 minute block time would also help, without increasing orphaned chains much. 


I feel like this is a political forum now, you have the Bitcoin Cash people on one side, the Bitcoin people on the other. If Bitcoin Cash comes up with a solution, Bitcoin refuses to use it. If Bitcoin comes up with a solution, Bitcoin Cash refuses to use it. 

This is why Segwit 2X failed, because people were against doubling the block size to 8MB.

Bitcoin Cash is an Altcoin, but like many, they may be technically more capable. Or was, not as efficient without Segwit, but still.

If we had an 4MB coin with Segwit, allowing 16mb worth of transactions, with a lightning network on top, for micropayments able to compete with Visa, with RBF and CPFP, and Smart contracts, this would solve everything. ",1523914698

&gt; Serious question: why do I care about 6 blocks / hr * 24 hrs / day * 365 days / year * 2 MB / block = 100 GB per year? A single one terabyte hard drive will fail from mechanical failure before it gets filled. A single 12-terabyte hard drive will last a century.

It's not about storage space. If your blockchain grows faster than tech improves, you reach a state where you are relying on every node NEVER dying. Rven a mining node on a huge server farm!, because you will never be able to spin it up again. You will never be able to sync to the most recent state. 

Remember, when you spin up a full node *from scratch*, it needs to download the FULL blockchain and validate every single tx. It takes today ~4-6hrs of modern hardware to spin up a full node. Next year, with 2MB blocks, it would be longer than that. Now think about 10yrs down the line, where blocks are effectively 1GB in size. With all the tech improvements it becomes literally impossible to sync from scratch.

Not a like-for-like comparison, but one year ago it was impossible to sync a full ETH archivial node on modern hardware, see [this](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/143/what-are-the-ethereum-disk-space-needs).

Blockchain bloat is a real problem.



&gt;I support an inflationary Bitcoin. The instability of Bitcoin in the absence of the block reward is already documented. And there's always some leakage, from death and forgottenness, destroyed hard drives, proof of burn, what have you.

I'm glad you pointed to that paper, that's exactly what I was referring to. And I don't even necessarily disagree on the inflationary part... but good luck in keeping the community united, i.e. non splitting, with this proposal. Again, pick your poison - Fee market or inflation. 

Ironically, most people don't even understand that paper, yet they happily downvote me and tell me how it's all been proven to be wrong... the latest I've heard ""*Because it assumes a fee market!*"" OK, conversation over.

&gt;Disagree here. Right now, the way to propagate blocks is to send the entire block. That's stupidly inefficient

Not true... even now blocks are are being transmitted much more efficiently. Graphene improves things even more, and is being worked on. At the same time, I'd like to see statistics of orphaned blocks when transmitting 1GB blocks, with or without Graphene. And this has to keep going for 1 month at least, to get any sense of statistical significance.

But this still does not address the problem of the blockchain bloat I mentioned above.


&gt;LN routing

Nobody ever claimed it's an easy problem to solve... but we have ""first approximations"" that actually work right now. Can it be improved? Sure... and I welcome everybody who thinks they have something intelligent to say to join forces. But all I see are videos/posts on why it cannot work and why it sucks. OK.

"I read this as not fundamentally different from stock splits or  receiving ""spinoff stock"" or distributions that occur because of change in structure (non-dividend distribution).

Assuming you bought 1 Bitcoin for $100 in 2010  and did nothing after any of the forks

Your  1 Bitcoin today has   1 BCH in Additional units (fork coins);    the BCH might or might not be worth anything,  but your total Cost basis for  the BTC and the BCH combined is  $100.

If the 1 BCH is worth $1000 and the 1 BTC is worth $8000,  and you sell the  1 BCH today,  then the cost basis should be   $100 * (1000/(8000+1000))   =  $11.12

Since your sale amounts to 11% of the asset,  the level-averaged cost basis would be $11.12

And the left over cost basis for the remaining BTC is now $88.88.

"This... Is not how VPN works. If you would like to understand more about how VPN functions, and how this is absolutely not the case, look up the term ""VPN Tunnel Protocols""

&gt; What makes VPN end-to-end communications different from simple LAN environment is Tunneling. You can think of it as a tunnel in the internet cloud through which the send and receive data requests travel.

&gt; The Tunnel is actually just a concept that helps us better understand the VPN network dynamics. When you initiate communication or send data over VPN network, the Tunneling protocol(s) used by the VPN network (like PPTP, L2TP, IPSec etc.) wraps up the data packets into another data packet and encrypts the package that is to be sent through the tunnel. At receiver’s end, the tunneling device/protocol deciphers the package and then strips the wrapped data packet to read and access the original message and reveal the source of packet and other classified information.

The VPN provider has literally no way of accessing the private keys that generated the tunnel. That is ONLY known the client (for obvious reasons), and so no one sitting on the other end of the tunnel can see the packets you are sending back and forth.

They CAN groom DNS pointers, since those are not encrypted so the client can find resources, which could give some insights that you might not otherwise have (such as the user visiting a Crypto exchange).",1523914160

"Government backed currencies do at least represent the GDP and social conditions of their respective countries. Bitcoin mining factories rely on power provided by government supported infrastructure and rule of law to dissuade people from stealing their mining hardware. In some sense the cryptocurrencies are parasitic in that they could hardly function without property laws enforced by governments and internet infrastructure at a bare minimum. Clearly central banks and government backed currencies are not without their flaws, but it's absurd to claim that decentralized currencies are categorically superior in every respect.",1523913906

You have been direct and specific by stating that ""square root of 2 is irrational"" is equivalent to saying ""selfish miners earn more than their fair share of revenue""? If that's the premise then I could prove I'm Santa.

"If you are new to Zilliqa (ZIL), here's a quick introduction: 

Zilliqa will likely be the first blockchain with live on-chain transaction sharding, which gives them a high, near linearly increasing, throughput:[ 2488 tx/s in their internal testnet](https://blog.zilliqa.com/highlights-of-fresh-experimental-results-testnet-v0-5-f72bcaefd21b). Additionally, Zilliqa uses the smart contract language ""Scilla"", which is similar to Solidity, but safer, e.g. things like the parity hack would've been prevented when using Scilla.

Like Ethereum, it is a blockchain on which you can run smart contracts. However, it is designed in such a way, that it is linearly scalable with the number of nodes of the network. I. e., the more Zilliqa nodes there are, the faster the blockchain gets. With the number of nodes Ethereum has at the moment Zilliqa would be able to process 15 000 tx/s! In the long-run they will focus on blockchain interoperability and privacy as well. For instance, Amrit Kumar, the Crypto Lead published a paper about the traceability of Monero, which spurred discussion about the topic and resulted in proposals for fixes (https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~amrit/papers/monero-analysis.pdf). Another distinction to Ethereum is the previously mentioned smart contract language Scilla, which offers higher security.

The public testnet was launched at the end of March! **Currently processing 2000 tx/s, which will be increased as time goes on.** The mainnet is due in Q3 of this year. [Here's Zilliqa's near term roadmap.](https://i.imgur.com/63BLxLg.jpg)

Minus one of those (farmers), all of those entities are taking all of our money and needlessly raising the prices every year. **This is the problem of distribution of wealth**. We need a way to regulate these entities. *All of our wealth is going to them.*

When we print money, that money goes into the economy, which goes into our paychecks, then to **them**.

You have a fundamental misunderstanding about bitcoin. We don't bitcoin because of hoarding. We bitcoin for control over our money. When we spend it, how we spend it, whenever we want to spend it, to whom we spend it. No one wants to sit on a pile of money. They want to spend it to have a good life.

They make a good profit on it. It can even be done with bitcoin, a deflationary currency, as long as you're smart about it. The problem begins when you make a lot of risky loans like what happened in the 2008 housing crash. If you make safe, smart loans and keep a good reserve then I don't see how it's a bad idea. Personally I think everyone I'd making a bigger deal out of this the. Is necessary. Obviously we need to put a shit ton more regulations on Banks to reel them in but the real issue isn't fractional reserve banking, it's money manipulation through artifical inflation by printing money to settle debts.

The P versus NP problem is a major unsolved problem in computer science. It asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified (technically, verified in polynomial time) can also be solved quickly (again, in polynomial time).

The underlying issues were first discussed in the 1950s, in letters from John Forbes Nash Jr. to the National Security Agency, and from Kurt Gödel to John von Neumann.

"&gt;I don't think that if the central banks stopped engineering inflation, and we allowed deflation to exist, that people would hoard money to any serious degree.

Do you have any actual argument for this, or is this just your opinion? I would argue the opposite based on my previous posts. 

&gt;What would happen then is that the average price of goods and services would start falling.

Again, you offer no actual argument, just speculation. Why do you think this would be so? Just saying that ""some business would have gains and some would have losses"" is like saying ""bitcoin will either go up or down"" ""It'll either be heads or tails"". That has no reasoning. 

The only thing I can agree with you on is:

&gt;banks have to be able to vet business plans, distinguish solid business plans from poor ones, and risky ones from safe ones.

This is what caused the 2008 financial crisis. The banks knew they could just throw out loans to anyone, even to people with bad credit, and eventually would have to get bailed out by the central banks, which in turn, would have to be bailed out by the Fed. This is not an inherent problem with fractional reserve banking or inflation, it's a problem with implementation of it. 

If we got rid of fractional reserve banking, how would you buy a house or a car? Where would you get a loan to do that? Many places even finance furniture. Our total money supply in the entire economy would immediately be decimated, literally. Our economy would crash like crazy. 

We need a way to regulate the banks in the system we already have. The fractional reserve system wasn't just set up the way it was, it organically happened through hundreds of years of banks failing time and time again on older systems. We should know better not to go back to those older systems. We need to improve our current ones. ",1523912297

"&gt; You miss the key point about centralization - Extremely high barriers to entry. If everyone can spin up a LN node, there's no centralization to speak of. Conversely, can you see how big blocks that force everything into the hands of a few miners ARE a centralization pressure? Huge mining operations and server farms are not really the domain of many.

Not everyone will be able to spin up *usable* a LN node. I linked a post regarding the limits of industrialized mining and how it will spawn home mining when ASIC chips hit a technological limit. We're close to hitting physical limits to transistor size.

&gt; Perhaps true. Just keep in mind that when the corrections occur, there's blood running. Quite literally. One such example was the French revolution.

&gt; Social ""corrections"" are not just ""oh, you lost $100"". It's a massive clash between the haves and have nots.

And perhaps it's what we need. It only happens when the have nots hit their limit on what they are willing to put up with. It's when major changes take place. I'll freely admit I don't have all the answers. Hell, I can't even conclusively prove my position. I'm just observing the fact that democracy in my country is not working. Any changes that have happened are because people who were fed up with the status quo decided enough was enough and spurred ""social corrections"". It was never freely given by those in power. Hopefully any 'revolution' is nonviolent and I think crypto is a tool in the nonviolence. Just to be clear, I do **not** want blood to be spilled.

"Just to clarify some points and add my thoughts - 

1) The overall supply of the coins is capped at 1.85bil. As of right now, a good portion of those are locked from the institutional investors along with the portions allocated to the team/advisors, and market development. They update their coins in circulation every quarter to reflect an accurate number.

The EOS variant will be a 1:1 fork of the current ERC20 token, thus creating a new 1.85bil tokens on that new chain but no new tokens are being added to the ones that already exist or will exist on the new chain.

2) Its hard to predict future prices but I really think the potential for this one is quite large, especially in the long run. Reasons:

 a) The current $50bil skins market is the start and immediate implementation and is already integrated with the #1 marketplace, OPSkins.

b) RobotCache partnership - Think of a decentralized Steam. The downloadable game industry is in the billions -and RobotCache merges those digital titles with the blockchain, which will allow digital games to be resold, thus creating a whole new market. Their site launches later this year and Iron (the RobotCache token) will be airdropped to all WAX holders. I believe the are only doing institutional investors and not doing a public sale (correct me if I'm wrong) so I'm thinking a larger portion of tokens may be dropped to WAX holders than I originally imagined, but time will tell.

c) WAX won't be limited to just digital items - it can extend to physical items and marketplaces.

d) Xsolla Partnership: The same payment process that Steam, Twitch, and a whole bunch of game companies use. Steam used to have Bitcoin payments but stopped because the fees were getting too high. One of the needs that WAX had was to have super low fees because some items are sold for pennies. Doesn't make sense to buy something for 5 cents but have 30 cents in fees. Now, I'm not saying a Steam partnership is imminent, or happening, but I can see the potential there one day if the stars align - but having Xsolla is a good first step and makes other things possible.

"BIPs not related to consensus codes are not the same as consensus related BIPs. ""Active"" doesn't mean anything in the context you are implying it does. It is not a softfork, it is not a rule change, it is not a ""standard"". It is something that Bitpay is ramming down people's throats. As well where did I call it a Bitpay standard? That was someone else, not me. That is you inserting comments I did not make to muddy the waters of this discussion. 

Bitpay unilaterally pushed something into the ecosystem, don't get pissy with other people for not just blindly following a company in implementing something, especially when that company was one of the spearheaders of the NYA debacle, which would have **factually ground the Bitcoin network to a halt if followed through with**.

&gt; Addison Cameron-Huff is President of Decentral, the company that develops the Jaxx wallet. Referring to BitPay’s statement that BIP70 does for Bitcoin what secured web-browsing (HTTPS) did for the internet, he told Bitcoin Magazine, “I think BitPay is overstating the case for BIP70. It’s also a bit misleading to refer to BIPs as ‘standards,’” adding that the “BIP” acronym stands for “Bitcoin Improvement Proposal,” not “Bitcoin Improvement Standard.”

“Not showing addresses is a big change in how people use Bitcoin, and, as of January 2018, I think it’s premature to force this change ecosystem-wide, but BitPay is only insisting upon this for people who want to use BitPay,” continued Cameron-Huff. “We’ll see over the coming months how this change affects their user base and whether alternative payment processing firms win marketshare (or don't). Ultimately, the cryptocurrency world is one in which the best products and proposals tend to win out in the market, and only time will tell whether this was a good decision for BitPay and more importantly: a good decision for the Bitcoin community.”

"What gives bitcoin value is people. What gives USD or other fiat currencies value is again, people. A government creating a cryptocurrency doesn't make sense. If they don't cap it, and keep the rights to print money to themselves, no one will use it. Or it will be used instead of fiat, which doesn't change anything. A government will never give up control of money supply. Bitcoin is a fringe experiment, an outlier, which no one thought would succeed. A kind of money that can't be shut off, can't be killed, and most importantly, printed and used by people themselves. It's not possible to stop it now. Never in the history of humanity we had the chance to truly control our wealth. Not even gold has this feature, in US it once became illegal to keep gold. The government literally forced everyone to give their gold and gave them worthless paper instead. This is why bitcoin will always have value. ",1523911269

"&gt; They could just keep it in a pile of cash, and continue to hoard. 

It would be an excellent thing if people could horde money. Then poor people would have cheaper housing and more buying power. And it would be much easier for them to save for the future.

&gt; More money in the economy is good. That's why just a little inflation is good. 

Completely wrong; printing money is inherently unfair, and is used to keep the poor people poor, and the old money at the top. The rich have access to new debt on better terms and vastly larger amounts.  When the rich people take out loans for new buildings or companies, the poor pay for it via inflation. Its a transfer of wealth from one person to another, such as featured in communism.

&gt; When that new money is created, we need to be able to distribute it fairly. This is the problem we need to solve. 

The easiest way to do that, which completely solves the problem is to STOP PRINTING MONEY.

Is that based on BTC dropping 80% :p,1523910778
"&gt;I think if you hang out on any golf course long enough you may find a ""disproportionate"" number of tax cheats as well. Mitt Romney only paid 14% tax on his 22 million USD income. Considering I paid 30% on my little ass income I feel he is a cheater. Granted he didn't evade taxes, he just has the means to hire someone to find all the fucking loopholes...if the system is rigged, aren't the ones gaming it the cheaters?

That's not cheating, that's playing by the rules, which as you point out are stacked in favor of people rich enough to take advantage of various legal loopholes.

The rules might not be fair but you won't change them just by breaking them. Nor will even an untraceable currency (which bitcoin isn't) stop taxes. The government can always just tax things you can't hide like property to compensate for any lost revenue.

&gt;To me the tax code needs to be greatly simplified. Income tax should go away completely imho. But if it cant, then lets make it simple/fast for people to pay them. Every year I spend an entire afternoon of my life filing/paying taxes. Yet I paid taxes all year long out of every paycheck...that seems fucking absurd to me. 

This may well be true, and the US has a particular problem with corporations lobbying to make taxes complicated so they can make money from offering tax filing services, but I don't think any of that changes the fact that Bitcoin attracts a high percentage of people interested in not paying tax (even if they aren't actively evading tax and just hope bitcoin will one day lead to not having to pay taxes).

I don't think the Bitcoin community can simultaneously say they have an ideological problem with taxes and talk about how Bitcoin will help take down the tax system and then complain at media portrayals saying they're against paying taxes. I've heard too many people say anti-tax things to buy it as an unfair characterization. If people think getting rid of taxes is a good thing you should embrace it rather than acting outraged when people call them out on opposing tax.",1523910652

"&gt;BUT... in the long term, you need that fee market to emerge, or the system will just come to a halt because of miners being able to game it. Either a fee market or a constant block reward, i.e. an inflationary Bitcoin. Pick your poison.

I support an inflationary Bitcoin. The [instability](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2976749.2978408) of Bitcoin in the absence of the block reward is already documented. And there's always some leakage, from death and forgottenness, destroyed hard drives, proof of burn, what have you.

&gt; And yet nobody addresses the question of blockchain growth... If blocks were 2MB, and full (aka effective size, not limit) the blockchain would grow 66% in a year. Broadband speed increases 50% every year. Take a minute to think about this, and they you'll realise that with 2MB effective size the blockchain grows FASTER then tech improves. So if it takes ~4hrs to sync up a full node today, it will take longer than that next year. And I'm not talking about RasPis here... broadband increases by 50% for the very TOP END USERS.

&gt; If the blockchain grows faster than tech improves, you have a problem. This is true TODAY with 2MB blocks (effective size). Do you really wanna talk about GB blocks?

Serious question: why do I care about 6 blocks / hr * 24 hrs / day * 365 days / year * 2 MB / block = 100 GB per year? A single one terabyte hard drive will fail from mechanical failure before it gets filled. A single 12-terabyte hard drive will last a century.

&gt;Sorry, but you are just diplaying your ignorance and, ironically, parroting. It's not about stead throughput because network security relies on blocks being transmitted ""quickly"" compared to the block time. That block needs to get to you really fast, or there will be many orphans, which reduces the security of the network significantly since a portion of the hash rate will not be securing the network.

Disagree here. Right now, the way to propagate blocks is to send the entire block. That's stupidly inefficient. Why not send a reversible Bloom filter of what transactions are needed, from mempool, and let nodes gather deltas of the missing transactions from mempool, using the fact that most nodes see most transactions already? Wait, this technique has already been described. It's called [Graphene](http://forensics.cs.umass.edu/graphene/graphene-short.pdf).

Fast propagation is solvable through smart efficiency, and that means the physical limitations that hold you back now are those that are solvable now too.

&gt;Yes it is. Not once have I heard ""yeah, let's start building L2 solutions!"" here. What you DO read a lot, on the other hand, is hos LN is shit and it will never work. How the vision is to scale on-chain. And that's all backed by actual work and dev plans - blocks are being increased, but not a shred of effort towards L2.

There will be a place for L2. In my view, they already exist. It's called exchanges.

LN can work, I don't disagree with that. But it fundamentally can't be better than Bitcoin. What's the weak point of LN that everybody brings up here? It's routing. How do you consistently successfully route? You either centralize into hubs incredibly quickly, or you listen to all transactions flowing through the network, so you (that is, your own LN node) can figure out what channels have what capacity that you have access to. If you're choosing the latter, you've just built your own mempool like any other L1 node, and you're bound by the same physical bandwidth constraints that you're decrying L1 for growing too fast.",1523910281

"&gt; I wish that was true. I think we are far from it.

Not right now, because of the price bubble, but in equilibrium or prolonged downtrends it definitely does.

&gt; I don't understand how you measure footprint of a sidechain. You mean code complexity?

To verify Bitcoin transactions you need hard drive space for the blockchain, memory for the UTXO set, processing power for computations, and bandwidth for transmitting and receiving blocks. To verify transactions on a sidechain you  would need extra resources to deal with that blockchain as well. If it is a very resource intensive and bloated blockchain, like Ethereum, then the resource requirements would be much large than to simply verify Bitcoin transactions. You would also need to be quite knowledgeable about that blockchain and how to implement it, because if a failure there could cause your entire Bitcoin block to be rejected by the network, that would be extremely costly.

What I mean by footprint is the combination of resource requirements and code complexity. Many sidechains could potentially be worth it to fork in, but I think it's important to have a good understanding of the costs and benefits before making a decision.",1523909624

"Speed doesn't matter for the person buying in terms of the money being transferred to the seller, but card transaction can take days to show up on your account (causing you to potentially think you have more money than you have) whereas cryptocurrency transactions are shown instantly. Also all card payments aren't instant, so cryptocurrency payments can be faster for depositing money to the seller.  
  
I don't think anyone disagrees that cash and most card payments are instant. For debit/credit cards, it's about how the bank you're assigned to dictates how the money is verified and used, instead of you being the one in control. Also again how transactions can take a while to be shown on your account.
Cryptocurrency payments can also be faster than cash, if you have a hefty amount of notes that you need to count, then a cryptocurrency payment would be faster. Smaller amounts of cash is of course faster, but then you're carrying around notes, coins, and cards instead of just your phone or a single card.  
  
BTC isn't easy for sure, but it's definitely easier and more free than initially setting up a credit card since there's many restrictions with those; even banks have restrictions which could prevent you from getting an account let alone a debit card.  
Using a card is definitely easier than getting your phone out and having to manually send the transaction, hence why many cryptocurrencies are developing cards of their own for people to use. It's also implied that future cryptocurrency payments will be like contactless card payments, using NFC from your phone and an NFC receiver at the till to make a payment quickly and easily - most likely using your fingerprint or 1million dot IR face detection to verify identity and send the transaction.  
Think about what card transactions were like during their inception. Having to make an ink press of the card's details and then manually inputting that into the system to be verified by the bank later on (I've had to do that in my previous job when the till system went down and it's horrendous). You also have the magnetic strip that is rarely used nowadays that can be a bit time consuming. Now though, you've got EMV and contactless payments making things very fast. Cryptocurrencies are in a very early stage and down the line, their payment process will become much smoother and faster.  
  
Privacy is opinion based, if you're fine with certain details being provided when making a payment then that's fine. There are people though who find it unnecessary to provide those details (such as your first and last name) when making a payment as you're just wanting to exchange some money for an item.  
  
Exchanges are places where you trade cryptocurrencies, they're not a place to store funds or make transactions. If an exchange got hacked and you lost all your coins, then that's your fault for leaving all your coins on an exchange. There's also exchanges who have been hacked and have completely covered the users finances at the exchange's expense.  
You getting hacked doesn't mean anything if your wallet is locked with a secure password and you have the private key encrypted or offline somewhere.

"DISCLAIMER: no one can really predict what the price will be like in 1 year, it might go down, it might stay the same, it might shoot to the moon, so take any predictions with a grain of salt.

Now, that said, I think what you're saying comes from the idea that Bitcoin in its current form has no real value, or has some very little value, with the price being based mostly or fully on speculation. This idea stems from the premise that Bitcoin will only truly attain ""real"" value by being adopted as a common place currency.

I think this way of looking at Bitcoin is totally backwards and 100% wrong. Bitcoin already is useful: it's the world's most secure store of value, it can be transferred at minimal cost in large volumes across the world, and you can carry any amount of wealth in a secure way within your pocket. That's what the price is mainly based on: Bitcoin's utility as a collectible and a store of value. The final stage of its evolution as a currency, when it is finally adopted as a legitimate currency by most of the world, is yet to come, and will surely bring about another huge price surge, but it is not a pre-requisite for Bitcoin to be ""truly valuable"".

"I work as a developer in finance for a brokerage. Investing is a sort of hobby for me. The markets literally holds the key to wealth so this perhaps is a bit of motivator. Master the markets and you'll be laughing. Anyways back to Bitcoin, I initially bought Bitcoin because I was looking for an interesting way to hedge my stock portfolio. From general media I knew the inspiration behind it was the financial crisis and the idea of a singular currency for the internet made sense to me so this seemed like an interesting way to do it so I bought some Bitcoin in 2015. With most things in investing I have a rule. If something is consistently performing well I add to the position so that's what I did over time. I got into Ethereum around $10 (which was pretty much ATH at the time) but really didn't pay much attention to it until it blew up. Obviously I wish I bought more but oh well. As for other alt coins I only really got into other cryptocurrencies july last year which is when I really started learning about it.

This coin is relatively new with no support on any Block explorer as far as I know, so I can't see how much I have in the paper wallet without typing my private key into the desktop wallet that hosts the paperwallet. Obviously, typing one's private key onto your Mac defeats the purpose of the paper wallet. So if I can create a private key for the paper wallet without ever having to type it in (except the one time you want to withdraw it); only to see what balance you have, what do I have to do? Remember: there is no Block Explorer for this coin. Edit: The coin I'm talking about is Campus Coin btw, just in case anybody knows of a block explorer that supports it..

"Full disclosure, I am a core developer on the project.

I agree, two exchanges is not enough. It makes purchasing difficult, and requires trust in at least one of the two. The team is working on adding additional exchanges, but it's a slow and expensive process for a project with low volume. Not uncommon in this space.

The team has had a lot of reports of syncing issues on the existing wallet. There are a few threads in /r/ecc as well as many messages in Slack related to it. With Sapphire, the new wallet releasing on the 20th, it is expected that these issues will be resolved. That being said, it is an open source project and others are welcome to contribute changes as well.

I understand the fear of the coin being all hype and nothing to show for it. But like you said, that happens for many projects in the crypto world. ECC has a working product, and the code for ANS, the first service to launch on the platform, is freely available on Github. The marketing team has done a fantastic job promoting the project and upcoming releases, and everyone is confident the products will live up to the hype.

I'm not going to hype you up and tell you to buy millions of ECC--I am not a financial advisor, and ultimately you should develop your own views based on the facts. I will tell you that the project attracted me due to the combination of lofty goals, project infancy, and the code for the product being open sourced. I love that I have the ability to contribute to the project in ways other than just investing.

Hopefully that was an unbiased view of ECC that helped to answer your question. Feel free to jump on Slack if we have any other questions.",1523906297

You know how long that would take?
The infrastructure has already been set up for the current blockchain and cryptos we have goin now... o car a snowball picks up speed and k EOS growing it is very hard to slow down... it would take years for government to create a blockchain... have you seen everything else they do?
They take forever, waste money while doing so, and NEVER runs efficiently, so good luck with that...

Current blockchain has foundation set, has people who are already slowly adopting the technology, and brilliant people workin day and night to make our banking and overall world a better place...

The financial position of the United States includes assets of at least $269.6 trillion (1576% of GDP) and debts of $145.8 trillion (852% of GDP) to produce a net worth of at least $123.8 trillion (723% of GDP) as of Q1 2014.

The U.S. increased the ratio of public and private debt from 152% GDP in 1980 to peak at 296% GDP in 2008, before falling to 279% GDP by Q2 2011. The 2009-2011 decline was due to foreclosures and increased rates of household saving. There were significant declines in debt to GDP in each sector except the government, which ran large deficits to offset deleveraging or debt reduction in other sectors.

Take for example this:

Trading DOGE to XRB/NANO, two different alt-coins that are dependent on the value of that specific altcoin at that specific time of the day on that specific exchange. DOGE trades in both ETH/BTC. Which value to you take that to be when converting to fiat?

Loaded up a linux vm.  I have a USB keychain drive.  I have to use Veracrypt to mount a container that contains my private information.  Inside that, I have a container that houses my crypto. I then mount that container.  I have folders setup for various cryptos and their private keys.  I used a local copy of MEW to generate that wallet.  I then GPG encrypt both the private key and the QR code.  

I basically follow this format for BTC, and some of the other cryptos...especially if they require their own unique software.  I have a copy of the main container in another location in case my keychain usb is corrupted or stolen. 

All passcodes are 30+ characters using LastPass generation. These passcodes are held somewhere.   

It was kind of my way of DIY cold storage. I understand the risks as well, though...if my PC has malware/virus (afaik I do a good job of keeping it clean, I also disconnected from the internet when I had to create my wallets), but also screen capturing via said malware could grab from my Linux vm.

I give neo similar potential as ether and the price difference mostly due to ether's first mover advantage. Neo will catch up at one point, rising faster than ether. I expect it to happen once neo becomes more decentralized and more ICOs being deployed on neo.

Ark is great and has a lot of potential. Interoperability and one click blockchains will be needed in future and ark does a great job in building a simple platform for everyone to use.  It will take a 1-2 years though until it reaches the deleopment level and awareness to show its full potential. But with 10% staking reward it's a compfy hold in the meantime.

IOTA is still by far my favourite hold and despite its market cap I give it the most growth potential. It's DAG technology is unique and it doesn't directly compete with most other blockchain projects. Many see it as a mere currency but fail to see that it aims to become the one protocol for iot, the biggest technological movement of the  next 10 years.

"Thank you so much for the detailed answers. My intuition is that the marginal effect of hashrate, after it has cleared a certain imaginary threshold of ""sovereign-grade attack resistance"" is probably negligible on the perceived value of Bitcoin. What's the difference between a network with 20 and 21 exahashes per second? It is just arbitrarily high numbers at that point. I think the greatest adversaries at that point are subtler attacks like infiltrations on the core developer team or attacks on fiat onramps (exchanges). 

Some attention has been granted to *relative* changes in hashrate. For instance: http://bitcoin.sipa.be/powdays-ever.png

This shows how many days an adversary with 100% of Bitcoin hashrate would take to rewrite the entire chain. You'll notice that it changes – dramatically sometimes, when new hardware is introduced or lots of hashrate comes online all at once. Some Bitcoiners pay attention to this, although the threshold is still incredibly high to clear. 

Ultimately, as far as hashrate is concerned, I think the biggest actual threat is the concentration of hashrate among single entities. That would make them vulnerable to tampering from the State. The absolute number of hashrate in h/s is probably not as important as the GINI coef for instance. ",1523904985

"From my personal experience, sometimes nordVPN glitches out, has connection issues, or uses a IP that has been banned by the site.  Like others have said, using mulitple IP's and encrypting your traffic may cause some exchanges to lock you out of your account. 
Furthermore a paid subscription seems like a waste of time when the average user has only a very small amount of crypto.   Putting it in a ledger or paper wallet should be safe enough and making things have extra steps only add confusion.

That being said, it’s totally going to be some bullshit nobody partnership or the will make excuses and either delay it again or say the partner backed out.

"&gt; Have you read ""Mastering Bitcoin 2nd Edition""?

No. I am familiar with Andreas' viewpoint. I have listened to his speeches on scaling. Have you read anything other than his book?

&gt; Both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash is going to have to do way more than 32x for it to compete and be ""better""than traditional payment mechanisms.

Yep, agreed. That's why things like graphene/compact blocks/xthin are already being worked on.

&gt;  Layer2 ""Lightning Network"" offers that possibility.

No it doesn't.

Remind me in 5 years.

&gt; The whole point of this is debate is if the confusion between having two versions of Bitcoin.

Nope. The whole point of this debate is a political problem started by a small group of people. Most of the original developers have left BTC.

&gt; If both have good technological use cases and a reason to exist [providing they not too similar] in there purpose/utility - then that's great!).

Nope. The one that's used as a global currency will invalidate the other one.",1523904331
"Ummm... Please tell me what part of my source of information is wrong?

The source I posted, it is fork.lol which is actually a BCore Soyboy/Fanboys site - designed to belittle the Bitcoin (Cash) chain at fork time, when they all suspected it would dump down to $5. Remember that?

"Just what I was thinking. Also, the entire point of having a Ledger or Trezor is that you don't need to worry about all of these other security measures. They remove the worry about malware with requiring a pin entered on the wallet + verifying every transaction made through it. One of their selling points is being safe making a crypto transaction on any computer you want. 

Having a hardware wallet + Mnemonic phrase backup in a safe that's fireproof/waterproof etc, is all you need to be virtually 100% secure. The only other good advice would just be advice in general about personal safety, which isn't crypto unique. 

Don't be a dumbass and shout your net worth in public, watch your surroundings, and don't click on shady things or go to shady areas. ",1523904263

"If it is the biggest partnership in the history of cryptocurrencies with a top tier multi billion dollar company know world wide (as claimed)....then I guess it doesn't change the fact that Verge people have lied before, has a dev that can't code, was hacked, doesn't have any of the features it claims to have, made fake announcements, pays to get pumped etc etc. 

So I won't apologize but I will have to re-evaluate my investment in crypto and what I think the future holds for it, and not in a good way.

Where do you get that number from? A 2-in-2-out transaction, which is normally 250 bytes in Bitcoin, would be about 1Kb with CT+Bulletproofs, so in total 4x the size. Larger transactions would see a much lower increase; with 16 outputs the BP would be less than 60 bytes per output.",1523904171
"Now you understand how a corporate can take the control of a technology by first expanding its influence with apparent support (money) and when those money are enough to function has strut, they will force you to embrace their vision (aka: they will be your owner) or they will suddenly cut their long arm (while you have no backup) leading you to fail.

That is exactly what they are trying to do with their patents: they first inject their ""free"" (but copyrighted) technology into the block-chain to the point that their solution would be assimilated by the users, then from that point you'll be forced to follow their vision, because if you don't (see: forks) you'll loose all their solutions suddenly, while you didn't researched for different (and really open source) solutions, since you assumed that you had one deployed already.. and ""free"".

These companies are like a virus: their only purpose is to infect a technology for their own profits to the point that eradicate their presence is very difficult if not impossible.

"I read this and laughed while thinking about the scene in “Commando” where Arnold is getting all geared up for his final assault.

In all seriousness though, if you own a ledger nano s, set up a second “decoy” wallet on it with a different pin #.  And like OP said, just buy a backup now in case yours gets lost, stolen, or damaged.

Since claiming like-kind exchanges are explicitly illegal in 2018, using that as a loophole for 2017 is a real stretch at best.

It’s impossible to deny that if you were following his picks in 2017 you made out quite well. Hopefully when you come back Ian you can get back to basics and stop letting the advisory cash influence you and your followers anymore!

like honestly man do you not see how stupid that is? 
im not trying to be mean here but how can you think that your post had any merit or provided new/useful information? 

At no point here did i say that its going up 100% invest now.   
*I have no idea whats going to happen next*  
Im just looking at your claims and what you have backing it up/how u came to this conclusion.

From what you said its   
Based on a chart from 2014  
Based on that charts pattern it could go down....but it might not

Thats legit what you said how is that relevant to todays market?  
""Bitcoin didnt crash as hard in 2015-17 ""  
Great so this ""trend"" isnt repeating 
What makes the 2014 chart so special? 
Im sure i could find a walmart or company chart that happens to match current bitcoin moves. Whats stoping me from being like  

""Well back in 2013 walmart did this and we are seing the same pattern in bitcoin curently sooo watch out""

Im just trying to get the point across that you provided nothing of value here.

""This is the only time we might see the same crash we did back then.""
Why? the market and players in it are soo differnt now why is now the time to see the same crash?

Do you see what im saying? theres nothing here to back up these claims.... not that you made any definitive claims all you said is   
""Its could go up or down""    

Anyways man if u dont get it im not going to sit here explaining it to you anymore

Best of luck in yout investment i hope you hit it big
If i can leave you with any advice its dont base current market on charts from 2014. thats it good day :)!

"These are the guys the IRS is going go after, not the average Joe who didn't pay his $500 in taxes. I've talked to a few CPA's and they've said IRS is extremely behind and understaffed. 

- In 2016 the IRS did fewer audits than ever before, despite an increase in returns. 

- Nearly three-quarters of all audits are handled by mail

- Each year, tens of thousands of taxpayers walk out of an audit with a check from the government. In 2016, for example, about 31,000 audits (1 in 4,400) resulted in refunds totaling $931 million

- During the 2015 fiscal year, the latest for which complete data is available, the IRS audited about 0.8%

- Of that 0.8%, 62.55% of those were with incomes higher than 1 Million.

- Taxpayers with a $60,000 adjusted gross income (AGI), for example, have just a 0.47% chance of being audited.

My point is, the chances of being audited are extremely low and the IRS is really behind. Add Crypto to the mix and I guarantee you that the IRS is looking for people like Ian Balina who have a lot of cash and show red flags. They are not going after the average Joe who is making $100,000 (including crypto gains) especially if they are only paying Crypto &gt; Fiat and not every transaction. They will see average Joe paid his taxes, showed no red flags and will focus on bigger fish. They are not going to audit someone who paid taxes but thinks they didn't pay crypto to crypto taxes.

"Of course the only question is about the value :P

The worth of the token strongly depends on the ecosystem, but the blockchain being a full EOS blockchain means, that you got a lot of possibilities you can build on top of WAX. Meaning all thos crypto games can not only trade and sell their items using the WAX token, but also run their whole game on it, and far far more.

Ya it probably is not likely that someone will burglarize your home just for your crypto but the thugs will for your safe which usually contains banking info/cash/ssn. Also of course for the usual stuff like jewelry that can be pawned off. 


Surprisingly most burglaries happen while the residents are still at home. One of the only countries where it is the other way around is the USA, partly due to castle doctrine/self defense laws and of course the 2nd amendment.

"I'm not going to cheerlead Tron, but it makes no sense to call something a shitcoin if it moves in lockstep tandem with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and every altcoin. That's just ignorant. So few people on this subreddit have ever invested in anything at the early stages or made any money beyond straight gambling on price movement that it's like the blind leading the blind.

I couldn't care less about a released whitepaper or whether there's initial code. All of this stuff is free software and it's perfectly legal to assemble it from other pieces of other projects in a weekend. Anyone can create a coin or write a whitepaper.

I also don't care if a coin is on another random exchange or whether it partners with some unknown company that has five customers. These are red herrings, too, because anyone can do this.

What matters is whether there's progress in the codebase, milestones are being hit, and leadership is actively engaged with the community. Can't make these up and they are reasonable expectations for what a successful project or company should be doing. Those are the basic KPIs for me, an outsider, to invest for the long term. There are several altcoins that fit my KPIs.

So far, these have served me very well. I invested in Apple in 1997 based on these KPIs since Apple was 90 days away from bankruptcy and was considered a total garbage company. 

Will Tron be a home run? Can't say yet, too early to tell. It's still too early to tell if Bitcoin will be successful. However, people are foolish to not HODL some on the side for the long term. I hate Bitcoin, but I am not going to let my own prejudices get in the way of making money.",1523902431

Right now, that video and the experience are millions of miles apart.

First and foremost, the only way to buy ECC is in BTC via just two exchanges and the process takes about 30 minutes and really does not feel that safe.

Now my small investment is sitting on an exchange that I have no idea I can trust - it's decentralised - cryptobridge - but hey, this is cryptocurrency, where **anything** can happen.

So, I download the current wallet software.
It works fine, until you get to create the wallet, which can take up to 36 hours to sync - you can short circuit this by downloading a .dat file, to about 3 hours.

So far, so bad - a very flashy video vs. the current state of affairs, so many worlds apart from the actual reality of buying and storing ECC, it's comical.

"1. In [a separate paper](http://www.avivz.net/pubs/15/inclusive_btc.pdf) by the same authors, the game theory behind DAGs is analyzed. Basically, the result is that miners will tend to minimize duplicates because they lose money from transaction fees if such duplicates exist. If miners are completely uncoordinated (as in Bitcoin), the optimal strategy is to randomly (weighted by the transaction fee per byte) sample transactions from the mempool, and this manages to reduce conflicts by quite a bit. The authors have also said that they are working on using block headers to allow greater (selfish) coordination between miners, which allows strategies that further reduce duplicates.

2. In the SPECTRE paper, the authors suggest rewarding all blocks equally, unless they are mined at an out of date difficulty (in which case the reward is proportionally reduced). They suggest this because in SPECTRE it reduces the selfish mining gains, but as you said it's more of a heuristic than an actual estimate of the block's relative value. Transaction fees give a somewhat more accurate estimate of relative value, though, and the ""first"" (in SPECTRE's ordering) block that includes a particular transaction gets the fee. ",1523901888

"Option 1. Data ownership and pseudoanonymity. You purchase membership to an adult site, you don't need to link your personal info.

Option 2. A payment processor would handle the dispute between merchant and consumer. Also, the reputation of the merchant has greater stake due to a  consumer's inability to chargeback. Example: merchant and consumer could both be linked through coinbase and coinbase helps determine consumer dispute.  

Something else to consider. Not all geographical locations have credit card infrastructure. For these places, crypto will be a huge boon. Regarding security, there will be layers of it in place (think retina or facial scans and other biometrics, plus zksnarks, linked to kyc/aml identification), plus smart contract deposit/withdrawal managed by financial institutions. Possibly, some kind of structure can be set in place with multsig keys that can provide greater security as well; consumer keys + plus institution key to fully withraw else limited withdraw amounts.

I can't really see a PoS system get as big as BTC without some player buying up way too much power. All you need is money (somewhat true for PoW as well) and with a PoS system there is no reversing it once it happens.

To me it seems that we need an entirely new way to solve the problem of decentralization. I just can't see how PoS is better. Sure less energy is consumed but that is an entirely different issue and needs to be solved in the world either way. It's not like the market/world/population won't consume too much energy, PoW or no PoW. Energy consumption needs to be solved by much bigger measures than the part crypto plays.

With PoW atleast there is ASIC resistance and possible algo changes. IMO until we find a better way, PoW stays superior. BTC is a bad example, Monero is better. Still it's an ongoing struggle, I realize that but I really like the way Monero keeps fighting centralization.",1523900054

On those occasions when I do encounter someone with a better technical understanding, the conversation generally finishes with ""*Moore's law!*"". 

Now I'm all for tech improvements and love the progress, but ultimately relying on it to make a blockchain sustainable is wishful thinking - It might happen, or it might not. And this is what I've never seen from **ANYONE ON THIS SUB** address, what happens if tech enhancements just don't keep up? Nobody is ever willing to even admit this possibility, just in case... to come up with a plan B. 

And, in my opinion, what's absolutely worst is that there are respected members of this community who know that could happen, who know that tech might not improve as required for on-chain scaling, yet they never say anything about it. You can tell people are aware of this in the subtle ways they avoid the question... Just as they avoid discussing the role of full nodes - The silence in some cases is truly deafening.

"&gt;The good traders GameKyuubi was wrong about only one thing: There aren't any good traders.

If you haven't seen a good trader yet, does that mean they do not exist? 

Nobody had ever seen a black swan. For thousands of years, that meant that they didn't exist. Until someone saw one, of course. 

You are running into a fundamental problem of inductive logic, and it's preventing you from seeing trading rationally. If you want to read more on how this matters to traders, I'd suggest [The black swan by Nassim Taleb](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00139XTG4/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1)

&gt;There are lots of us who believe we are good traders. But we aren't. Of course, some of the loudest voices on Reddit regularly remind us about how well they time the market. Except when they don't time the market well.

Here is the first misconception about trading. The best traders have never timed the markets. They utilize arbitrage opportunities, which exist in countless forms across every asset class, and rarely have anything to do with market timing.

[I highly recommend reading The Quants if you're interested in learning how successful traders operate, as well as their history. It's not only extremely informative, but highly entertaining](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0036894XC/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1)

&gt;A paper published last October by the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley entitled ""Do Day Traders Rationally Learn About Their Ability?"" used nearly 15 years of stock market day trading data to conclude that all day traders are irrational, the vast majority of day traders lose money, and even when day traders are successful, they ""irrationally attribute success disproportionately to their ability rather than luck.""

Now this I agree with. The mass majority of traders are terrible at trading, and when they do win, it's because they are lucky, not because they are smart. One of the fundamental books on Wallstreet for understanding this is [What I learned losing a million dollars](https://www.amazon.com/What-Learned-Losing-Million-Dollars/dp/B00NC63DBW)

The entire story is about an extremely successful trader who lost everything on one bet, mainly because his entire life before that had been a string of extremely lucky coincidences, and he never realized it. 

&gt;Of course, their success was due to their unique trading ability and not the fact that the entire market rose like a rocket.

Keep in mind, the best traders are always benchmarked against an asset or index. This is called [beta weighing.](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/learn/beta-weight) If you make less money trading then you would have from just holding the bench marked asset, you have effectively lost money from trading. 

&gt;Warren Buffett, the most successful investor of modern times, has often said that he only invests in what he knows. His preferred holding period: forever. With that model, his company, Berkshire Hathaway, has averaged a 19 percent annual return since 1965 which means it has risen more than 1 million percent.

There are a lot of reasons for Warren Buffet's success, but it's worth pointing out that it's a lot more complex than just picking a security and holding it forever. If you want to learn about value investing, and the fundemental analysis behind it, check out [Security Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Security-Analysis-Foreword-Buffett-Editions/dp/0071592539)

It's written by Ben Graham, the guy who taught Warren Buffet everything he knows. Arguably the most important concept in the text is called [investing with a margin of safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_of_safety_(financial)

Bitcoin definitely has intrinsic value. The problem is, nobody knows what that intrinsic value is worth. Since there is no currently known method of valuing a decentralized network (although progress is being made) Warren Buffet wouldn't touch bitcoin with a 10 foot pole, and if you want to invest in value, the way he has, you shouldn't either. 

&gt;Trading is no solution for intelligent people. What we need are new ways to use cryptocurrency.

Ouch man, that's harsh. I'm interested in why you correlate hodling with intelligence. IMO, there are dumb people hodling, and dumb people trading. Most of the time, it's those who form an opinion based on a single source, or worse yet a single quote, who are dumb. It's those that thing in absolutes, and without a healthy degree of skepticism. 

According to Ben Graham, it's not the speculators or the investors that are dumb. It's the people that can't tell the difference between the two. ",1523899530
Interesting to see how this business evolved over time. Just goes to show how dynamic companies can be at this stage in bitcoin's development. They have transitioned 'upstream' from creation of bitcoin for themselves (21E6) to creating hardware to allow others to create bitcoin (21.co) and software to allow others to earn bitcoin (earn.com) and now they are being bought out. Quite interesting!,1523899530

"[Emiliano Pagnotta] Thanks for your questions. In the interest of time, I will try to keep my answers concise. You point at many interesting related questions. As you know, one cannot tackle all issues rigorously in a single paper. We envision our work as an agenda and we believe that this paper provides a useful foundation upon which we can build.  

About the first point, we study a single period economy, so the issue of scalability over time is not fully addressed. We plan to address scalability in future papers, but it certainly requires additional features. 

I fully agree on the second point!

Arguably, one of the biggest innovations of the Bitcoin white paper was to make economic incentives explicit in the context of a decentralized network. However, non financial incentives are also important for the resilience and survival of the network and the economic community around it. This is best illustrated by the heroic efforts of open source developers over the years but also by those that run full nodes out of a sense of conviction. We do not mean to minimize these at all. Instead, given our research goals, we highlight the components that are price sensitive, such as mining rewards.

We do plan to contrast proof-of-work with alternatives as we model portfolio choices in this environment.

"If you keep posting about beating banks, that might be why. Let me explain. 

Banks are essential to finance for a couple of reasons:

- Mortgages and loans. Buying houses and starting businesses usually require loans. Peer to peer won’t work without a 3rd party because someone has to look through the loanees financial data to determine their credibility. Plus, the returns wouldn’t be particularly high. 

- Security. Banks are legally required to return funds if they have been fraudulently taken. If I have $250k in my bank account and someone takes it, it’s returned to me. With BTC, it’s gone. Tough luck. You may be fine with that, but most people won’t like that at all.

- Banks aren’t so corrupt outside of America. They are more tightly regulated and have learnt a lot from 2008. For example, my bank offers up to 1% interest, does not charge me to keep my money in there and does not charge me for wiring to another bank. 

You might be able to change the banking system, but you won’t remove it. There is a need for the service they provide. You should be looking at legislation to ensure they do not screw you. ",1523899081

I can see how that might be beneficial to business owners but why as a consumer would I make the switch?  I'm not going to give up the benefits I get with my credit card like I said above so the business can benefit.

&gt;Selling point of crypto is, maybe the businesses offer lower prices with crypto payments?

I could see this, but with the rapid fluctuations in price I don't see businesses going towards holding their crypto but just dumping it for USD immediately.

&gt;Maybe the crypto you originally bought with 10,000 is now worth 100,000 and you can buy anything you want with it? So you rather not waste transaction fees in converting to fiat.

Back when it was 20k people were thinking 30k+ by end of the year. Ive noticed when the market sucks people want to say BTC will never break 15k again and ask these questions. But if BTC is mooning people act like there is no way in hell it will see under 8k prices again. 

My reasoning for it hitting 20k easy is the big money hasnt even remotely flexed its financial power yet. Instustional money will soon come in and make $800 billion marketcap look like its nothing. You have Asian nations that ristricted crypto for the last 4 months beginning to allow their people back in the crypto waters.

2) you ever receive a letter from your bank saying your credit card was compromised and they are sending you a new one?  yeah that doesnt happen with crypto.  if someone gets access to your wallet or exchange and empties your account you are FUCKED.  yes there are precautions to make and stuff, but the security is just not up to par yet.

"As for airdrops, I probably mixed up terms unintentionally. Forked coins != airdrops.

I imagine that airdrops are taxable at market rate depending on how many you received and if you want to stake your claim on them. Personally, I don't bother with airdrops.

One reason the $0 cost basis makes sense to me is that not everyone owning Bitcoin asked for it.  Sure we could just ""not claim"" them but what if we change our mind 10 years from now? Must we go back and amend taxes from 10 years ago?

Another reason is that it also becomes a problem of selling some off to pay taxes. The moment the forked coins become available on an exchange, a massive sell-off would occur just to pay taxes. This drives the price down and you may end up with a handfull of people unable to pay taxes on BCH simply because the price dropped too low to cover the tax bill.

"You're the creator? That's awesome. I transcribed a piece about [Bitcoin energy consumption - Rebuttals](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8694dq/bitcoin_and_energy_consumption_rebuttals/)

I don't know if you'll ever get to do more, but things I think would further consolidate the point

**Environment implications, compared to gold:** https://www.brilliantearth.com/gold-mining-environment/

 Bitcoin's energy use is *one hundreth* of the energy used in mining gold. Gold is integral to the monetary system that Bitcoin is directly trying to replace. There are also environmental costs of mining gold - from sulphuric acid leeching into rivers, denuding hills, destroying mountains, etc. A tiny fraction is being used for industrial use, the vast majority of gold is being held as store of value.

**Step down converters**:

More practically, every charging device with a step-down converter sits plugged in and coverts electricity to heat. The estimated power this consumes is 2 orders of magnitudes greater than what Bitcoin consumes. This is a worldwide phenomenon which is an enormous drain of energy. 

**War:**

The world's largest polluters and energy spenders are military; the main purpose they serve is to kill people.

**Journalistic dishonesty and sensationalism:**

All of the journalistic analysis goes like this: if it takes X kilowatts to conduct 1 transaction, and we took it to world scale, how much energy would that cost? They disregard that the energy used is completely unrelated to the # of transactions.

"&gt; And we should support them for at least supporting bitcoin at all at this point

Not necessary. They are hardly supporting bitcoin by accepting it and immediately converting to USD. Yes, it offers hodlers another place to spend their bitcoin.

"Sure, you can loosely define any investment as a pyramid in which the early adopters benefit more than the later adopters. My point is the value of a P3D token is and will always be derived from nothing except people buying into it. And the more people that buy into it, the harder it will be to continue recruiting people. Many cryptos are like this as well, but I only invest into projects with an actual business model and use-case for their token. For example, VeChain has many enterprise-level partnerships and a working product. There is a high chance that their blockchain will be used more in the future and that they will sell more of their product/service; both of these increase the value of the VET token. The value will eventually be fueled by adoption of the token, not by nothing. The same argument can be made for multiple other cryptos as well. 

Obviously there is no way to know for sure if the VET platform, or any other crypto, will be used in the future, but it's a far better investment than a token that has clearly stated it is based on absolutely nothing except people buying into it. 

BTC is essentially a pyramid scheme but it is still less of a scheme than P3D in the sense that there is a planned use-case for BTC as a currency, and some people already accept it now. Regardless, I don't own any BTC.

Why would they be behind? BTC and ETH are the only two that have ever tested their capacity. Coins without these massive amounts of transactions have not been realistically tested.

Other coins have proposals, but they are ideas only. BTC was supposed to have free and instant transactions too.

Regarding miners, miners only get paid if people use them. If they arent used, they dont get paid. Hardware is irrelevant to this for the most-part.

We provide a discussion on page 17. We also try to estimate this value, please look at Figure 4 on page 23. 

The exact estimate of the optimal inflation rate depends, among other things, on the quantity that reflects the security or attack resistance of the network. We acknowledge that such quantity is very difficult to estimate, since one does not observe frequent successful attacks to Bitcoin. Intuitively, the lower the probability of a successful attack, the lower the optimal inflation value.

Option 2, I use cyrpto.  I get no fraud protection, no cash back, and my money is gone immediately with no protections in place in case of fraud or bankruptcies.  Not to mention I have to call my accountant to figure out how much tax I'm gonna owe just on the crypto itself.

"[Andrea Buraschi] Good question. However, you need to take into account how the monetary reward affects the interaction between demand and supply, which ultimately determines the equilibrium price. 

In the paper we address this question in Proposition 4.iii. The price effect of a change in the monetary reward is non-monotonic. The reason is that it affects the equilibrium bitcoin price through two channels. The first relates to the monetary incentive for miners to contribute hashrate. Ceteris paribus, a larger value of the monetary reward increases the incentive to provide hashrate, thus increasing “trust” and the bitcoin price. 

The second channel, however, relates to the debasing effect of new bitcoin injections, which, by reducing scarcity, reduces the equilibrium price. Our analysis suggests that the effect is in general non-linear. Indeed, for a DNA like bitcoin, if the marginal value of trust is decreasing, there exists an optimal monetary policy: below a certain threshold an increase in the monetary reward increases the price; above that threshold the price decreases.

If you take this in a dynamic setting, if miners and investors know with no uncertainty the dynamics of the monetary reward going forward, their mining and investment decisions today would anticipate any future change. Thus, in absence of frictions, prices would adjust smoothly and no “jump” would be observed at the time of the announcement. This is indeed consistent with an EMH argument.

On the one hand, it would likely lead to higher hashrate, increasing the price. On the other hand, it can lead to less equal hashrate distribution among miners, reducing decentralization and trust. 

For brevity, we model in the paper an economy with homogeneous miners and, therefore, everything else being equal, there is positive connection between hashrate and decentralization. We plan to address extensions with unequal miners in future work. 

Our intuition is that both the system hashrate and the degree of hashrate dispersion across miners have a positive effect on the valuation.

"The INS Platform is designed as a very high-load system. The market potential for INS Ecosystem consists of billions of users, each of them making dozens of orders per year. The main focus is on performance, in which we seek smart contracts support, predictability, stability, and ease of use. We plan to use the most proven and scalable open source technologies and constantly monitor alternative technical implementations. 

As the existing blockchain platforms such as Ethereum have inherent limitation in transaction bandwidth (currently limiting to a dozen tx/sec), and prospective platforms and frameworks are only in the development stage, we also consider designing and developing our own INS blockchain platform in the future, where nodes are selected from a semi-trusted set of supporters. Given the trust in the nodes, we will implement one of much faster consensus algorithms from the BFT family (HoneyBadgerBFT/Zyzzyva/others), enabling up to thousands transactions per second. A smart contract virtual machine will run on top of the consensus algorithm. The state of the INS blockchain will be regularly anchored to the most popular smart contract ledgers (at least ETH) so that proofs of state and proofs of transaction (within INS) can be verified by Ethereum smart contracts (like it is currently done in BTCRelay or will be done in the future in Plasma). Common optimization techniques such as state sharding and payment channels will be also implemented. 

After the ICO period, all contributors will receive an EIP20 exchangeable INS tokens on the Ethereum network. Whenever the INS blockchain is launched with its own token mechanism, the EIP20 token will be always accepted for exchange to a new token 1-to-1.  

The INS token is a core component of the INS ecosystem and is designed to facilitate all kinds of operations that make the token an integral part of the ecosystem and the driver for its economy. The INS token is fractionally divisible, transferable and fungible.

TOKEN SERVES AS A STANDALONE UNIT TO ACCESS SERVICES ON THE PLATFORM

The INS token built to provide bespoke logic for producers to form a loyal base of customers. It’s used to facilitate marketing, bonuses, discounts that could not be efficiently handled in fiat/ETH/BTC. The INS token gets utility value from the services it gain you access to - direct-to-consumer marketing. Over time, the token utility value increases as manufacturers who want to market their goods can get more services (additional types of marketing campaigns) using the token. 


TOKEN HELPS TO GROW A COMMUNITY AND PRESERVE THE VALUE INSIDE

INS Ecosystem will be expanding beyond the crypto community and focusing its activity on the broad audiences. Manufacturers will be able to reap value that they would not receive otherwise . As the INS token is adopted by more consumers and suppliers, the network effect of the INS ecosystem will grow, building the value of the ecosystem for the benefit of ecosystem participants. INS is going to add value to the INS community (expansion to new cities, adding new types of services), and while INS Ecosystem has own token, that value benefits the INS community. If no own token, the value may freely leave the community.",1523894090

A coin doesnt have to solve anything, it doesnt have to be a solid choice, it will succeed if the marketing department is great.

This is what happens often enough in peoples mind, BUT it will not work for the long term IMHO and thats why DYOR is always a good advise.

"I'll do the math for you:

Say you owe $8,000 in taxes for 2017 and have no fiat to pay.

Say you have 3 bitcoin valued on tax day at $8,000.

Do you sell 1 bitcoin on tax day and pay your tax?

Or do you decide 'my bitcoin will double in one month',  so I'll file and NOT pay for a month.

In one month my taxes due are now 8000 plus 40 (8000 * 0.5)  plus  20.10 (8040 * (.03/12)) or a total of $8060.10.

So bitcoin has doubled in one month,  so I sell 1/2 of a bitcoin to settle up with the IRS,  (I find the $60.10 in the sofa). 

I saved 1/2 bitcoin for a risk of $60.10,  not bad.

"Because it's true. The market currently supports BTC over BCH.

By the way, this is the same as late 2011 when investors who bought bitcoins at $2 when everyone was mocking them as digital Beanie Babies. At the risk of stating the obvious, the way to make money as investor is to identify the unjustly hated investment and go big into it.

"Could you elaborate on the relationship between changes in the cost to mine a bitcoin and the trust in the system/pricing? You say:

&gt; Perhaps counterintuitively, the price decreases with the marginal cost of mining, which is driven by factors such as electricity costs, due to the reduction in the equilibrium network trust (measured in hashrate), thus reducing the bitcoin valuation.

Does this mean: if mining a bitcoin gets cheaper (i.e if it costs $3000 to mine a bitcoin and an ASIC is released which reduces that to $300), then the effect on price would be negative? Would this be because it is now cheaper to reverse the history of the chain, as equipment is more efficient? And this damages the trust individuals have in the network security? ",1523892599
"&gt;Give it up, dude. You even claimed that it works on paper. Nobody has proven 'mathematically' that it doesn't work, and every piece of evidence suggests it does work given the assumptions. Whether those assumptions are reasonable is not something that even can be proven mathematically.

Then after saying that I kept researching and refound/posted [this link to CSW's paper draft](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8b8hea/psa_here_is_full_mathematical_proof_csw_posted/), which proves Emin's model is wrong and also includes proof that SM loses both profit and revenue.

&gt;How would you even 'mathematically' prove that miners will act in a certain way to counter the SM behavior?

We are well past the phase where the only criticism was that Emin's model doesn't take into consideration that honest miners react, although that consideration alone already invalidates it. 

The mathematical proof in CSW's paper shows that the probability distribution model in Emin's paper is wrong completely, and selfish miners lose both revenue and profit regardless of whether honest miners react or not. 

&gt;Bottom line: the threat of SM is (and always has been) almost universally agreed to not be critical. The issue has been with Craig's claims about how his 'math' proves it to be impossible even in theory. That's bullshit, and always has been.

Bottomline: SM has been proven to be impossible both in theory and practice regardless of whether Honest Miners react. ",1523892596

[**You**  even claimed](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8a0t74/mea_culpa_there_was_a_mistake_in_my_last_proof/) that it works on paper. **Nobody** has proven 'mathematically' that it doesn't work, and every piece of evidence suggests it does work **given the assumptions**. Whether those assumptions are reasonable is not something that even **can** be proven mathematically. 

How would you even 'mathematically' prove that miners will act in a certain way to counter the SM behavior? 

Bottom line: the threat of SM is (and always has been) almost universally agreed to not be *critical*. The issue has been with Craig's claims about how his 'math' proves it to be impossible even in theory. That's bullshit, and always has been.  ",1523892290

"Hi, PhD student on blokchain here. So I have a few questions \(I mainly read the tl;dr and skimmed through the paper so I am sure I missed a lot of things\):

* There is this \*idea\* that cryptocurrencies follow a trilemma between scalability, security\(censorship resistance in your work\) and decentralisation\(i think this is the same as your \*trustlessness\*\). Any idea how scalability, which relates to usability, could be taken into account in your study?
* By the way, it would be awesome to have mainstream media write about censorship resistance. It is often overlooked.
* What do you think of incentives that are not financial like how full nodes are not paid to verify or how a miner will continue mining even if it is not profitable for some time? The ideology is the big part of the bitcoin narrative.
* Are you planning to study different consensus type \(like the mention on Ripple\)? Anything you want to share on that?
* How did you decide which model to use for the decentralized network? ",1523891978

My interest in blockchain usage is really more of a tech/macroeconomics hobby that helps pay off student loans haha. 

That said, it seems from my limited software development knowledge that BTC is behind the curve in terms of all scaling solutions.  Correct me if I am wrong but this is mostly because miners control the chain governance and they don't like change because it limits their ROI because change reduces their ability to continue using older hardware.  That incentive combined with the concentration of mining power into relatively few entities makes major changes like the ones you mentioned unlikely. 

This is really why I don't have BTC. My original statement about it being a noob's bet was impetuous for sure but I genuinely don't have faith in the BTC development community to scale the project for real use as a daily currency.

This effectively creates constant temporary token burns, and a good deal of actual token burns when ENJ is kept in an item and out of circulation.

The btc accumulation should prompt an alt cycle so i've been slowly entering, setting stops and targets.

Then i realised, why the fuck set targets? the highs should depend on length of the cycle (last summer cycle was longer than winter and we had higher peaks) and the length of the cycle depends on how long btc accumulates.

"Hi cylemmulo. All of your questions have merit. Good questions. Here's a bit more on my background. I worked my way up from a merchandiser to an account manager with Coca Cola. I then worked with other top global companies. For the past 4 years I've been operating my own real estate business and have been a top producer among 600 agents at my brokerage. You can check me out on LinkedIn. 

My entire professional life has been evolved around sales, relationship building, marketing strategies and account management. I couldn't have learned from a better company than Coca Cola, as they are world renown for their marketing and sales. 

Sure, I may not have a lot of experience with cryptocurrency exchanges. This industry is still relatively new though. I plan to utilize my communication skills, creative thinking and my persistent efforts to learning in order to build relationships with the exchange and educate on why I believe GoldCoin should be listed on every exchange that you will find BTC, LTC &amp; BCH on. I believe in GoldCoin's tech, their user friendly wallets and their plans to continue innovating in this competitive market. We are here to stay. 

GoldCoin has been gaining momentum, the community is strong and steadily growing each day. The team has been attending conferences around the world, we've updated our websites, whitepaper, our client and a new iOS wallet app is currently being tested with Apple.

"This week I successfully converted two businesses in Hong Kong to accepting BCH. The first one was **Kavia,** a pretty expensive champagne bar near Lan Kwai Fong. 

http://www.hkclubbing.com/directory/nightclubs/kavia.html

The two girls who run the business are already old-school bitcoin fans, and they already had the Bitcoin.com wallet on their phones. It wasn't too difficult to convince them to let me pay for a bottle of champagne using BCH. 

The second business is a newly opened restaurant called **F-word,** located at 38 Elgin St in Central, just off the escalator. (https://goo.gl/maps/ozyU5KqiDrJ2). They had a sign in their window saying they accepted BTC, ETH, and LTC, so I basically had to ask ""[why not bitcoin cash?]( https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/cryptidz/images/c/c6/Why_Not_Zoidberg.jpg"")"" The sign in the window now also lists Bitcoin Cash as one of the acceptable payment options. They are accepting various cryptocurrencies through a payment gateway built by local exchange ANXPRO. 

I also tried to convince **[Sing Tailor](https://goo.gl/maps/XMx7REr9Xst)**  to let me pay for some clothes with BCH. The manager of the shop, Gabriel, was very receptive to the idea, but he was ultimately shot down by the owner of the business who was not present. I think one of the biggest dealbreakers to businesses considering whether to take the plunge or not is the ease of converting back into the local currency. Currently, ANXPRO does not have BCH trading on their exchange, which makes things a bit more difficult. ",1523889655

The Tax return may declare that you owe the IRS,  but if you don't actually send a check,  the IRS assess a penalty,  and starts charging interest.  And that is perfectly legal on your part AND their part.

Ultimately,  you will HAVE to pay all taxes due,  plus any penalties and interest incurred,  or the IRS will f you over.

This is important because  if you:

* owe taxes on 2017 trades
* don't have the fiat to pay
* believe strongly your coins will recover soon

"I've used bitcoin to move money between international bank accounts before.

I have bank accounts in several countries with different currencies, so I signed up for a local exchange in each country. When I want to move money between my accounts, I do a bank transfer to one of the exchanges, buy bitcoin, send the bitcoin to the other exchange, sell it and withdraw it to the other bank account.

Both transferring to and from the exchanges are standard same-day domestic transfers, so it only takes a few hours from the money leaves one bank account until it's available in the other.

The alternative would be doing a standard international transfer (SWIFT), which would both be slower and more expensive. An international transfer takes at least a day or two, and the currency conversion fee is higher than what it costs to exchange to bitcoin and back combined.

I did have to comply with KYC/AML for both exchanges, but as there's nothing illegal with what I'm doing, I'm not concerned about them knowing who I am.",1523888780

You would pay tax on those stocks yeah. Say you bought Apple stocks for $100, they rise to $1000 in value. So you trade them directly for $1000 worth of Tesla. You've realised a capital gain of $900, so you owe tax on that $900. It doesn't matter if you cash out to dollar or not, you've gained $900 in value. 

In the UK we have a capital gains tax free allowance of £11,700, so we could use crypto to pay for things without having to pay tax provided our gains are below £11,700. I do think crypto specific tax laws need to be created, the current system is ridiculous.",1523888470

"Thanks for saying what many of us are too afraid to, for fear of engaging a false equivalence response.

BTC supporters actively come here and intentionally spread misinformation or deceptive language designed to trick people into buying BTC instead of BCH and prevent them from learning about the technology and history of bitcoin.

They project their flaws, faults, and shortcomings onto Bitcoin Cash. Like the modern-day Tea Party, when anyone points out a shortcoming or mistake the response is to project the flaw onto their opponent and viciously attack. No technique is out-of-bounds and no attack is below the belt.

These are the actions of *fanatics*, not supporters or investors. This is not rational economic activity, this is irrational response to fear. They have the deep-seated fear that they could, in fact, be wrong - and thus lash out violently at the slightest perception of a threat to the worldview in which they are not. Like a religious zealot that finds himself in the logical corner of Epicurus' dilemma, the reaction is to physically lash out and accuse one's opponent of the very wrongs they know they commit. When they are identified as the zealots and fraudsters that they are, they change their clothing, hide their faces and mask their voices so that they may come back with a mask and renewed vigor.

It is my experience that anybody behaving in this zealot manner is attempting to adhere to an indefensible worldview and is solely reacting emotionally to perceived threats to it. There is no rational logic involved; it is nothing more than the guttural instinct of ""it's a threat to me therefore I must prevent it"". The concept of abandoning an indefensible position is simply unacceptable when viewed through this lens.

These pathetic slanderous posts made by impersonators and stalkers only demonstrate how wrong their ideas are. If BTC needs people to attack BCH for its own survival, then BTC probably doesn't deserve to survive in a world where BCH exists, and if it does manage to anyway, it will only attract undesirable activity. BTC supporters already create an environment where legitimate business is unwelcome and thieves can thrive.",1523888030

I can also personally vouch for him seeing as I live nearby and went there last week and paid in BCH. I assure you that the owner of the cafe is not confused and understands exactly what he is doing. I will go ahead and make an assumption that you do not speak/understand Japanese so it is forgivable that you are not aware of the vibrant community we have here.

"**SYN flood**

A SYN flood is a form of denial-of-service attack in which an attacker sends a succession of SYN requests to a target's system in an attempt to consume enough server resources to make the system unresponsive to legitimate traffic.

***

**SYN cookies**

SYN cookie is a technique used to resist SYN flood attacks. The technique's primary inventor Daniel J. Bernstein defines SYN cookies as ""particular choices of initial TCP sequence numbers by TCP servers."" In particular, the use of SYN cookies allows a server to avoid dropping connections when the SYN queue fills up. Instead, the server behaves as if the SYN queue had been enlarged. The server sends back the appropriate SYN+ACK response to the client but discards the SYN queue entry.

You could be buying and selling seashells and make/lose profits in a similar way but that wouldn't be an indication of practical value.

However, a word of caution: Make sure sufficient due diligence is undertaken before investing. Cryptos can be highly volatile and they are at the stage of infancy; there’s a possibility that many coins may fail or are downright scams. The crypto world is extremely intimidating, due to the complexities in understanding the technology. The use of technical computing terms can confuse and deter outsiders. This is the main reason why many stay away from Cryptos.",1523886386

*****
&gt; NEW DELHI - Coinsecure, an Indian cryptocurrency exchange, said nearly $3 million were stolen from its bitcoin wallet, the biggest reported so far in the country&amp;#039;s fledgling virtual currency market.

&gt; Coinsecure, which has over 200,000 users trading on its platform daily, said that around 438 bitcoins, which were stored in a password-protected virtual wallet were siphoned off to an unknown destination on the internet after the details were leaked online.

&gt; Bitcoins in India were trading at 480,000 Indian rupees, or about $7,359 on Friday, according to cryptocurrency exchange Coinome, well below its international market price of about $7,771.

"Statements of intent are meaningless. Actions speak louder than words and those 'defensive' patents aren't doing anything good for the crypto ecosystem, while nChain's patents are providing whole-cloth utility despite being rights-reserved.

I don't see any Blockstream software being produced that is commercially useful, at all. LN has easily another year before it's viable for commercial usage, assuming a magic solution to the unsolvable problem of reliable decentralized routing with incomplete network maps and a magic bullet to prevent liquidity censorship on the part of channel providers. Tall orders, to be sure, but even without those insurmountable obstacles, Blockstream has provided *measurably negative utility* to Bitcoin - not just zero utility, but negative utility. Bitcoin is *less* useful now than it was in 2015. Less providers use it and less merchants accept it, and it is less reliable to send or receive Bitcoins.

Meanwhile, nChain is producing commercially useful software *today*. All those 'defensive' patents do nothing for the crypto ecosystem when nobody is developing utility - they just instead *prevent* innovation by pre-empting others who would accomplish the same goals through the same means. Given a choice between a benevolent ""defensive"" patent that is never innovated on or a traditional ""offensive"" patent that creates utility even at a cost to the user, I'll take the one that creates utility, not the one that stifles it.",1523886236

"&gt; Also, you have no idea whether the private key is still stored and monitored for incoming transactions and whether the private key has been compromised in the meantime.

Pretty much all wallets monitor old addresses for incoming payments. If an old payment key is compromised, then it's the user's fault, not the merchant's fault. The rule should be keep the private key private until you are sure a refund is not needed.

&gt; From a privacy perspective you are revealing a refund has been made.

Not necessarily. That second payment could be from anyone.

&gt; so the refund address not being stored on-chain should not be any problem for the judicial system.

In order to prove that I didn't get my refund, I must first prove I sent them money in the first place. If that first payment transaction also proves I own the refund address, then I can't claim I don't own the refund address. The way BIP70 sends the refund address through a ""backchannel"", Bitpay can't prove that address belongs to me, so I can always claim I don't own that address and didn't get the refund. If I send them the refund address through a support portal, the portal has a record of me sending them that address.

The only problem with refunding to a input address is that it'll be messed up if the wallet engages in transaction batching. In that case, there will be multiple senders, but only one input address. If a refund is sent to the input address, which sender does the refund go to? Batching is a BTC only thing, so it shouldn't affect BCH too much. A solution might be to include an OP_RETURN with each output that lists the refund address.",1523885790

I feel like this is beyond the realm of governments and borders. It's like trying to tax the oxygen that's in the airspace within the US borders.

Regardless of how silly the laws try to classify it.

For example, You ""must"" file an FBAR aka FinCen form 114 if you have had at least $10k worth of any asset or financial instrument in a foreign account at any given time in 2017 ( even if only for a minute ). So they are using this to say if you have transferred $10,001 worth of BTC from coinbase (USA) to binance (China) you are to report.

However, the problem is that bitcoin does not exist in the physical realm. There is no location for Bitcoin. It is  within a digital network and kept track of on ledgers across the globe. Therefore, there is no ""foreign account"" 

Btw, you ""must"" file a FATCA aka form 8938 if you had $50,000 in transactions on a ""foreign account""

Both of these things have extremely harsh penalties and I haven't heard anyone winning against the gov.

Penalties include: 
$10,000 fine if you failed to report because you didn't not know you had to 

$100,000 fine or 50% account value (whichever is greater) if you knowingly failed to report


Things to note:
FBAR is simply a report to notify the gov financial crimes department (FINCEN) and there are no taxes on these reports

FATCA is reported to the IRS ",1523884536

Been having some thoughts around the disclosure of crypto holdings to the authorities as a huge consumer protection risk. Neither them, any government, bank or company has been able to protect citizens from identity theft, a fundamental inherent problem of the legacy system, and one of the reasons such information is not required when using bitcoin by design (assuming you avoid custodial services and exchanges, but then you're not really using bitcoin). 

A further concern is the future breaches which might become more prevalent following the instantiation of the Automatic Exchange of Information (FATCA AND CRS), which has lead to the sharing of personally identifiable information with 50+ participating countries. Exposing such information could lead to personal liabilities if such information is not secured and authorities held accountable for the protection of such information. The amount of information automatically exchanged is frightening, and adding personal crypto assets would expose one to further risk of such information falling into the wrong hands. ",1523884201

"**Final Fantasy VII Remake**

Final Fantasy VII Remake is an upcoming action role-playing game developed and published by Square Enix for the PlayStation 4. It is a remake of the 1997 PlayStation game Final Fantasy VII, retelling the original story following mercenary Cloud Strife as he and eco-terrorist group AVALANCHE battle against the corrupt Shinra megacorporation, and the rogue former Shinra soldier Sephiroth. Gameplay is planned to be a fusion of real-time action similar to Dissidia Final Fantasy, and strategic elements, and the game will be released as a multipart series.

Rumors and demands for a remake of VII existed for many years, but multiple reasons were given for why the project was not being developed.

"&gt; Plus we have a whole raft of circumstantial evidence of covert ASICBoost usage

The ""whole raft"" seems to be no evidence, even circumstantial.

Covert ASICboost is done by fiddling with the choice and order of transactions in a block.  One cannot use it on empty blocks. 

I don't know why Bitmain was reluctant to adopt SegWit, but there were plenty of reasons to reject it, and no good reasons to accept it.  It is an ugly crock of a pointless hack, that Blockstream inented and pushed for the wrong reasons.  And the users seem to think so too: 8.5 months after activation, SegWit adoption is still only 33% (and 15% was from a single entity).

Bitcoin Cash had to be forked before SegWit was activated.  

&gt; segwit stops covert ASICBoost usage

So?  If ASICboost turned out to be profitable, why wouldn't Bitmain/Antpool use the *overt* version, which is not prevented by SegWit?

The ASICboost scare was just another vicious smear campaign from Blockstream and allies.  You can see how sincere it was from the fact that BTCDrak is somehow involved with Halong, that now claims ASICboost as one of their features.

(However, one should wonder whether Halong actually uses ASICboost, given their very small efficiency advantage over Bitmain's rigs.)",1523883914

"&gt; You're going to counter that I've misread the paper again

No I think we agree that the paper probably establishes the feasibility of a narrow, edge-vector attack against Bitcoin that is very unlikely in the real-world because the paper does not attempt to take into account the exigencies of the incentive system; and we agree that the section entitled ""The Problem"" (which, if it isn't the Problem Statement, is probably mis-titled in a scientific paper) is off the mark (probably entirely); and that the ""Solution"" presented is almost surely not applicable.

So what's left is the validity of the math supporting the edge-case attack (which isn't presented as ""the Problem"").  Here, better minds that mine have reached some consensus that the math is at least internally consistent, but I've seen no careful examination of the assumptions underlying the math.  We agree that invalid assumptions were at the root of the failure of the paper's Problem and Solution section, so one wonders if invalid assumptions might lurk underneath sections 1-5.

You can understand that I think the paper is either poorly constructed or poorly written.  At the very least, sections 6 &amp; 7 are an Olympic contender for ""Jumping to Conclusions.""  It seems clear to me that the paper's authors were trying hard to make the problem seem far more dramatic and important than it is: without the possibility of a Sybil amplification, the paper pretty much makes the case that the attack is an edge-case at best and claims that the attacker, without a Sybil amplifier, is at a disadvantage.

Now I'm not going to take the time to try to uncover gotchas in the rest of the paper because, man, this is exhausting.  But, I wouldn't be at all surprised to find that underneath the rest of the paper are some other assumptions baked into the math, that a truly prying mind could uncover.  If the authors could make such a giant leap of assumption in sections 6 &amp; 7 -- *proposing changes to the Bitcoin protocol based on an **assumption** FFS* -- then they might have made similar errors anywhere.  I'll take your word on it that there are no such errors, but not because I think you or anyone else has really taken this paper to task, but because I'm lazy and tired of arguing :)

**How to convert received Bitcoin/Altcoin to USD/EUR/etc**

Bitcoin/Altcoin to Bank Account -

1. You will need to create an account on any crypto trading platforms (Bitstamp.net or Poloniex.com or Bitfinex.com, etc)

2. Setup so that all your received payments are automatically forwarded from your MyCryptoCheckout account to your account on Bitstamp/Poloniex/Bitfinex/etc (enter your Bitstamp/Poloniex/Bitfinex/etc coin wallet address in MyCryptoCheckout payment box settings). And use the ""autosell"" feature (auto trade your cryptocoins to USD) on Bitstamp/Poloniex/Bitfinex/etc.

3. Using that functionality you don't need to worry if cryptocurrency prices go down or up. Within 1-2 hours after a cryptocoin payment has been received by you, your payment will be automatically converted to USD on Bitstamp/Poloniex/Bitfinex/etc and will be kept on your Bitstamp/Poloniex/Bitfinex/etc USD account.

4. Later you can withdraw your USD from Bitstamp/Poloniex/Bitfinex/etc to your own USA/UK/France/etc bank account",1523881479

"I've had customers scan my BIP21 payment codes (yes, including ""&amp;amount=x"") and whose wallets silently ignored the amount and they then entered their own fiat-denomination and let their wallet do the currency conversion; which have hit both over and under target.

I've had customers scan the code and then their wallets just get stuck at ""sending"" but no transaction geting broadcast.

I've had customers broadcast transactions with fees below the relay (they showed me the transaction in their wallets).

i've had customers broadcast transactions with fees that made it very uncertain if they would actually end up in a block, or be discarded.

Most of the time I've just looked at it and figured it'd work out, it's ""good enough"", but that's something I as a small merchant can do; it doesn't work large-scale.

The most significant issue is likely the fee issue; I could eat the risk of a small% deviation in value on a small % of incoming transactions, but a single dropped transaction is worse. People knowingly sending low-fee to get their money back later could quickly become an issue if allowed in the first place.

I can make “cowcoin” with a trillion tokens.  If I add a functionality to a market that slows users to buy and sell I will see demand in real-time.  If the active trading price is $1, then by association I have a 1 trillion market cap.

"I'm not being selective in which fake pumps I'm looking at. 

The key to assess market sentiment is to look at:

1) the reaction after the pump or dump. Look at the baseline growth. Three big negative dump attempts, each getting absorbed by a flurry of buying.

2) volume

Looking at those two things, the last few days, and today especially, is MUCH different than two weeks ago.

Two weeks ago there were these ""fake"" dumps and pumps and the market was dead in between with no volume. 

The last few days? The market pumps and people buy in after and keep raising price. The market dumps and people buy in and immediately erase the dump attempt.

I don't know how much clearer of a signal you want that the market sentiment has turned.

You do what you want. I've been buyin nonstop on the way down, in increasingly larger $ values as we went lower. I'm already green again.

You make money in bear markets either by timing it perfectly and shorting or tethering. You also make money by treating it like an accumulation phase and staggering increasingly larger buy orders. It ONLY works for an undervalued asset, and is obviously extremely risky with something like crypto. But that's why I'm only using money I can lose.

However that strategy is infinitely less stressful to me, and reliable. 

I'm not deluded that I can predict the future, which is why I don't short and tether against whales in a volatile market. To me that just gives away all my edge as a somewhat smart investor, and places it all on chance.

So we could correct bigtime, for sure. If we do, I will just pool buys and keep buying and accumulating.

I'm pretty confident that 2020 me will be happy even with my Feb Mar purchases, but the April ones will look amazing because it's likely I got a BIG piece of the floor.

I dunno man, to me it looks very promising, just looking at baseline floor growth in between pumps and dumps.",1523880271
"This illustrates a nice a nice difference between Blockstream and nChain.

nChain have created a key generation method and have patented it. From the link:

&gt; WO2017145016 (Deterministic Key Generation): ""Determining a common secret for the secure exchange of information and hierarchical deterministic cryptographic keys"" provides a method whereby two connected nodes, with no trust relationship between them can derive a deterministic hierarchy of each other's public keys through simply sharing their respective public keys and a message of some format, where the respective private keys can still only be generated by the owner of that private key. Further information on this method can be found on nChain's website at https://nchain.com/en/blog/nchains-security-inventions/

"BTC is currently too volatile to work without a fiat intermediary, so its ability to be adopted in a country without access to intermediary services (exchanges, banks, payment processors) etc is extremely limited. Merchants can't afford to keep cashflow in BTC, a business with a 10% margin could have all its profit wiped out if BTC drops 10%, and can't afford to wait weeks or months for BTC to rise again before paying its suppliers.

You should also look into the problems Zimbabwe has had with USD deflation (3% deflation a month at its peak), because its not been able to get enough supply of USD to meet demand (meaning value of USD has been consistently rising in Zimbabwe). This despite USD being the most widely available reserve currency in the world.

The USD has also caused problems that it is much stronger compared to neighboring countries money like the South African Rand, meaning Zimbabweans have been encouraged can get more for their dollar by buying imports rather than to buy domestic goods priced in USD, which has hurt Zimbabwean manufacturers and exacerbated the USD shortage (as Zimbabweans sent USDs out of the country)

"Hi everyone. Andrea and I are so pleased with the interest you've shown in the article. We're going to start answering your questions early! We're online now, so keep your questions coming. 

Here's some extra information that might be helpful:

In the article (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3142022) we propose a valuation model for a class of crypto assets that we label Decentralized Network Assets (DNA). We apply this valuation framework to the Bitcoin protocol.

An identifying property of these assets is that contributors to the network quality (miners) are compensated in new units of the same token that are enjoyed by consumers of network applications. 

As a result, network quality and the DNA price are jointly determined. We show that the valuation of a DNA such as Bitcoin can be obtained by solving a fixed-point problem.

Prior to joining Imperial, I was an Assistant Professor at the New York University School of Business. My recent studies have examined the effects of speed and trading fragmentation on asset prices and social welfare; the effect of central clearing reforms on prices and liquidity; the transmission of information in financial markets; and the consequences of new regulations on market quality and performance.

I heard that to stop the continual freefall they need to peg it to something that retains value far better than the currency (Gold, Oil, widely adopted Cryptos, etc...).

To do this is mainly a psychological problem since there is no way they can own enough of the asset to truely peg it to an asset.  I.e. it doesn't have to be definitively pegged merely have enough liquidity such that people believe it is pegged while they run a fractional reserve like every other functioning currency around the world.

Take ISO20022 as the last example, EU has firmly embraced it through SEPA and the fast wave spreads far beyond EU now. There is an ongoing race, time is critical for everyone, this will affect economies. Standardized fiat instant payments will compete with crypto payments, that's why crypto will have to converge in order to win. As the whole ecosystem matures and the right way to scale (whatever it is) gets finally proven in theory and in practice, the concensus/mining/propagation layers will converge first and the upper semantic/application stacks will differentiate a potential global crypto standard at some point in the future.

"I think you have got their technical limitations well thought out. The other red flag has been the involvement of Brock Pierce, one of the EOS founders. I don't like to reiterate the issues surrounding him but there are many.

Like you, I was already skeptical about the platform itself and felt it was a poor third place behind Neo 1 and Cardano 2, and then I read about multiple scandals involving Brock Pierce and it put me right off. With all this said I am a big believer in Blockchain not only performing well but also having the right teams and networks to build an Eco system not only based on performance based fundamentals but relationships, Tron, as much as people like to hate it, is an example. So though I have reasons to dislike EOS I am the first to admit it may have a use case and may have enough heavyweight backing to see it gain significant adoption. 

I have read today that heavyweight crypto investor Ronnie Moas claims there is a top 10 coin about to explode and 4x or 5x very quickly. I ruled out BTC, ETH, LTC and BCH and figure it is either Stellar, NEO, IOTA, Cardano, EOS or XRP. I figure Moas would mix in the same circles as Novogratz so it could be EOS, though IOTA with all it has going on right now is also a good bet. 

A portfolio with equal weighting to IOTA, NEO, EOS, Cardano, Stellar is not a bad set up IMO at this point in time. ",1523875997

"**HODL On: In Defense of Bitcoin's Best Investment Strategy**

https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-in-defense-of-hodlers/

Steven Hopkins is chief operating officer and general counsel of Medici Ventures, an Overstock.com subsidiary focused on the advancement of blockchain technology.

In 1987's Black Monday stock market crash, Sam Walton, the world's richest man, lost more than half a billion dollars in a few hours.

When reached for comment, Walton said, ""It's paper anyway. As far as I'm concerned we're focusing totally on the company doing well and taking care of our customers.""

He didn't care about dollars; he cared about his asset Wal-Mart, and he still owned that.

History of the #HODL In bitcoin's volatile and roller coaster past, ""HODL"" was the meme that bound the cryptocurrency community together. It stood for the proposition that we all believe in the future of bitcoin. It's both funny and insightful.

Here is the original post by GameKyuubi on a Bitcoin Talk forum (spelling errors and profanity included):

I AM HODLING

I type d that tyitle twice because I knew it was wrong the first time. Still wrong. w/e. GF's out at a lesbian bar, BTC crashing WHY AM I HOLDING? I'LL TELL YOU WHY. It's because I'm a bad trader and I KNOW I'M A BAD TRADER. Yeah you good traders can spot the highs and the lows pit pat piffy wing wong wang just like that and make a millino bucks sure no problem bro. Likewise the weak hands are like OH NO IT'S GOING DOWN I'M GONNA SELL he he he and then they're like OH GOD MY ASSHOLE when the SMART traders who KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY'RE DOING buy back in but you know what? I'm not part of that group. When the traders buy back in I'm already part of the market capital so GUESS WHO YOU'RE CHEATING day traders NOT ME~! Those taunt threads saying ""OHH YOU SHOULD HAVE SOLD"" YEAH NO SHIT. NO SHIT I SHOULD HAVE SOLD. I SHOULD HAVE SOLD MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY SELL AND BOUGHT MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY BUY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT NOT EVERYBODY IS AS COOL AS YOU. You only sell in a bear market if you are a good day trader or an illusioned noob. The people inbetween hold. In a zero-sum game such as this, traders can only take your money if you sell.

so i've had some whiskey

actually on the bottle it's spelled whisky

w/e

sue me

(But only if it's payable in BTC)

It was not about bitcoin versus bitcoin cash or 1,000 other cryptocurrencies. It was bitcoin vs. the world and we ALL embraced it.

It only took 11 minutes for this post to become a meme that became the rallying cry for the entire crypto world. We were all on the same rollercoaster ride and GameKyuubi, in the depths of his frustration, had (sort of) elegantly articulated both what it feels like and the best trading strategy for an asset this volatile.

Buy and HODL.

The good traders GameKyuubi was wrong about only one thing: There aren't any good traders.

There are lots of us who believe we are good traders. But we aren't. Of course, some of the loudest voices on Reddit regularly remind us about how well they time the market. Except when they don't time the market well.

A paper published last October by the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley entitled ""Do Day Traders Rationally Learn About Their Ability?"" used nearly 15 years of stock market day trading data to conclude that all day traders are irrational, the vast majority of day traders lose money, and even when day traders are successful, they ""irrationally attribute success disproportionately to their ability rather than luck.""

This sounds exactly like the crypto trader. Any post you see mocking HODL is likely someone who thinks they are really smart because they made money by trading crypto last year.

Of course, their success was due to their unique trading ability and not the fact that the entire market rose like a rocket.

HODLing works Still, empirically, even in volatile assets like bitcoin, carefully choosing an asset and holding long-term positions has proven to offer the best return.

Warren Buffett, the most successful investor of modern times, has often said that he only invests in what he knows. His preferred holding period: forever. With that model, his company, Berkshire Hathaway, has averaged a 19 percent annual return since 1965 which means it has risen more than 1 million percent.

Theoretical models that assume participants know when markets will move against them can offer better returns but, in practice, market movements cannot be reliably predicted so even when people like Bernie Madoff try to make us think that they've figured it out, they haven't.

Long-term investment in quality assets remains the only reliable investment strategy.

Simply put, HODLing works.

More possibilities For those not interested in limiting their activity to HODLing, there are two new and useful ideas that have begun bouncing around that really do advance cryptocurrencies: #BUIDL and #SPEDN.

BUIDL has been used to help remind us that, in the words of a CypherPunk's Manifesto, ""Cypherpunks write code."" In order for the blockchain to really be useful and valuable, we need to build stuff on it. Watching the price go up and down either as a trader or a HODLer does nothing to make bitcoin work better.

We need to create some of the promised applications that can really change the world. To date, the blockchain community has fallen short in this regard outside of the areas of payments but there are some real wins.

Just this weekend, Voatz, a Medici Ventures portfolio company is running party county convention voting in Utah, state convention voting in Michigan and state primary voting for overseas and military voters in West Virginia, all on a blockchain platform.

Blockchain voting is a simple application, but it is one that can bring a much-needed security and transparency to elections. And we are doing it now.

SPEDN is a nod to the many of us who realize that, for bitcoin to be useful, we need to be able to spend it to buy things. And I mean everything. It really doesn't matter whether it is through second-layer solutions like lightning or forks like bitcoin cash; we need more ways to use cryptocurrencies in real-world transactions.

A focus here, rather than complaining about HODLers would be helpful. We need many more merchants to accept cryptocurrency before it becomes useful. Options to spend bitcoin remain severely limited in most areas and this will ultimately limit bitcoin's value.

As for me, I will HODL until I can buy useful stuff and SPEDN.

HODL on This year has seen intense regulatory pressure on cryptocurrencies and its time we stop pretending that HODL was stupid. It isn't and it wasn't. Anyone who doesn't like the HODL mentality needs to give HODLers something else they can do with their bitcoins.

Trading is no solution for intelligent people. What we need are new ways to use cryptocurrency.

We need BUIDLers and merchants who will let us be SPEDNers.",1523873208
"&gt;The whole paper exists to present a Problem Statement.

&gt;The Problem Statement falls down in light of emergent mining topology, and frankly presents a giant sweeping fallacious assumption that appears to have gone unchallenged for years. This we call ""bad science.""

I had to look at the paper again to see if you were right, because the way you phrased it I thought you had a good point. Unfortunately the section you are calling ""The Problem Statement"" is not what science calls ""The Problem Statement"" or what the paper itself calls ""The Problem Statement."" It comes up as a subsection of a section of the paper titled ""Hardening the Bitcoin Protocol"" and it is labelled ""The Problem"" There it proceeds to argue that the Bitcoin protocol cannot assume gamma is low because of the possibility of this Sybil attack, which means that an attacker with almost any hash power at all can selfishly mine against Bitcoin. It then proposes a way to achieve a lower bound of 25% hash power to SM instead of 0% in the subsection called ""Solution."" 

This entire section of the paper, far from being necessary as you claim is actually just an embellishment that could have been removed. Emin and Itay were under no obligation to suggest a way to harden the Bitcoin protocol. That was just them trying to be good Samaritans. If we now know gamma is naturally low in Bitcoin that's great. Then the discussion isn't applicable to Bitcoin, though it may be applicable and interesting to some other crypto thats easier to Sybil.

You're going to counter that I've misread the paper again, and I'm going to reply again asking you which of us you think the authors would agree has the correct reading. I don't know how to get is past this impasse and I think I've run out of energy for this argument. Cheers.",1523873195

"&gt;When in the history of humanity has money sat in a value that remains accessible but persists NEVER being used. If it truly is never used, that is one thing. If it sits unused for a long time waiting for an opportunity for its holder to spend it, that is a very different situation.

The question is meant to illustrate that the market doesn't know ahead of time which currency is lost, destroyed or just not being used. That only a small amount of currency never gets traded isn't the point. 

If you burn $100,000, the market doesn't know there is now $100,000 less in the world, everyone else's dollars don't immediately increase in value relative to the decrease in quantity of currency. Whether you burn it or just put it under a mattress, no signal is sent out to the market, not in 2 weeks or 2 years or 20 years. There is no difference to the inflation rate during all that time. The only time a signal would be sent is if you decided to stop holding the money and to then spend it. it then contributes to the rate of inflation because you are now adding more dollars competing for a given amount of goods and services. 

the more dollars are spent (velocity), the greater the number of dollars are chasing a given amount of goods and services at any one time, the higher prices will be pushed, the higher the inflation rate is. you cannot understand this process from a binary framework of either money is never spent and has no effect or is spent at some point in the future and has equal effect if money is spent 10 times in a year or 10,000.

&gt;If the coins are sold, demand is reduced by the amount equal to the person holding 100k BTC but was previously unwilling to sell. Obviously this would impact DEMAND, but not supply.

If you increase the number of people trying to sell something for a given number of people trying to buy it, you will increase supply relative to demand and price will decrease. If you have lots of people trying to buy but few people trying to sell you will have high demand relative to supply and so price will increase.

Demand and supply are two different concepts. They can both increase or decrease, together or separately. Increasing the amount of something sold doesn't automatically decrease the number of people trying to buy. Increasing supply can increase demand in some cases (i.e. things that become more useful/desirable in greater supply).

&gt;You need to do some thinking on this question for yourself. The resources are out there. Try to come up with an answer and let me know if you have more specific questions.

I've read and discussed extensively on this subject and have not yet found a convincing answer that doesn't have an obvious flaw in it.

Would you like me to go through every answer for that question I've ever read and explain why they're wrong? I was asking you because I argue in good faith and assume other people can have correct answers I haven't heard of yet. I don't need to go read the same faulty arguments I've already read, especially not on a vague recommendation of ""resources"". I could tell you to go read some books on monetarist theory but it wouldn't make for a good discussion.

&gt;Suppose you are a doctor with medical malpractice liability insurance that you pay $300/month for. Now suppose that you save $250,000.

"I've been thinking on the same lines recently and I have been asking people of the world to share their current tax situation. What strikes me is the huge disparity in government's responses. The US and China seem to be hottest on this, whilst Denmark is apparently under no obvious tax guidance at all. The aggressive nature of the US tax system reflects a centralized response to a decentralised threat.

 The UK and many others are collected on captial gains (This tends to vary depending on annual earnings) and is fairly straight forward. If you warm too much, it could be 50% tax!!!

I couldn't even begin to make sense of the NZ guidance recently! Essentially, with so many different approaches, governments are able to (very easily) decide the fate of the nature of crypto at will. China has two rules (inside HK vs rest of country) and I seem to remember the US had a different stand point for NY at one point. One rule for the people, but don't let our investors miss out!!! 

Here in the UK, I've heard all the negatives from mainstream outlets, soon to be followed by huge loss stories from those that got in Dec/Jan and read into the HODL meme. 

In my experience, control the money, control the people. A governments response to crypto is a good gauge on how they treat their people.
