‚ÄúMuh no working product‚Äù - this one is painfully untrue, product has been working for over a year now. It‚Äôs a private chain at the moment

"Nice informative reply.

Yes all is true. I would like to point out that smaller timeframe traders usually want to stick to their small timeframes because that's where they are used to trading. Having these huge spike ups is normal in any market. I have watched currency pairs do the same what Bitcoin did (in relative terms), as the price climbed 100x the previous volume in 1 minute (you see this when you try to trade the news). 

So small timeframe traders have to deal with this, that is their trade-off compared to bigger timeframe traders. That is why they have to put stoplosses. Although i do wonder how well those stoplosses activate in these scenarios.

I understand why you want to warn these traders, but they should already know that these spikes are *supposed to happen*. That is their trade-off of what they have to deal with. Nobody recommends trading on smaller timeframes, because it is actually harder and you need to be an expert (or a bot) to play it well long-term.

Just a short comment: I believe the yet-to-exist crypto from Telegram (TON/Gram?) might be the one to be widely used. Unless if the likes of WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and such beat them to it. Or their implementation is better.

These companies have one big advantage - they already have a presence among hundreds of million users. Most people have yet to own any cryptos because it requires some effort to obtain. They are also intimidated by things which we may see as ""easy"". Like transferring cryptos to wallets, converting to fiat etc. But if companies like Telegram make sending and receiving cryptos as easy as sending and receiving attached images, a lot more people will be using these.

"if you only have crypto worth 50K now you had a significant loss. You could trade your coins for BTC or ETH again and immediately buy back the coins you had before. That way you would lock in the losses for you taxes and could subtract that realized loss from the gains you made when you traded at 300K peak. 

The way taxes work in my country is that you have to convert every crypto value to their ‚Ç¨-value at time of purchase and sale. The difference will be your profit or loss (using First in, first out). I'm assuming thats also how it works in the US so if you trade back and forth now you would realize a loss and could deduct that from your profit.

"Bitcoin cash has a partial malleability fix. I think 3rd-party malleability is no longer allowed. But the sender can still change it.

I think 10 minute blocks may actually allow more throughput than shorter block intervals. Saw a video (by somebody apparently studying etherium), claiming that the maximum throughput of a cyptocurrency is 27 transactions per second. However Bitcoin Cash, with it's longer inter-block interval (etherium is like 15 seconds), will be able to process 100 transaction per second next month (with 32MB blocks).

But Bitcoin and other crypto aren't remotely stable enough to serve as a hedge, so they instead act as a primary investment. And a very stupid and risky one.

I then should plan accordingly knowing I'll be taxed on it (either set cash aside or sell assets to cover it).

What has SegWit solved? SegWit was always a problem in search of an ego stroke.

Re: Big blocks...
&gt; This doesn't get you to massive scaling like we need to take on Visa and MasterCard, but it seemed like an obvious first step.

We shall see. Right now Lightning network gets you only Blockstream hoodies, while Bitcoin Cash works immediately for anything for practically no fee. No one was trying to be Visa overnight (obviously LN isn't). 

""Off chain scaling"" is a euphemism for ""scaling something else."" You don't scale bitcoin ""off chain."" You scale IOUs for bitcoin.

&gt; Anyone could open LN channels

Anyone can open LN channels as long as they can spin up a server and connect other devices and then fund the payment channel. How is this a solution and not a problem? Bitcoin Cash works the same way bitcoin used to work before the self-flagellation of SegWit came in.

&gt; Covert use of ASICBoost conflicted on a technical level with Segwit

This narrative was pushed by SegWit supporters because SegWit had to demonize Chinese Miners and ""there's an attack!"" is an easy narrative to push on people. Same reason you call those who question Blockstream's banker funding ""half-wit anti-Semite."" This is also why Jihan, one of the sharpest minds in bitcoin and the original translator of the whitepaper into Chinese, was villainized.

Perhaps that‚Äôs good for the market in the long term since the financial focus will be almost exclusively on adoption, but in the short term, until there is widespread use, trading for value will collapse and prices will plummet.

"Bitcoin. Litecoin. Nano. Possibly IOTA if they meet their primary use case.

The utopia the most diehard members of the crypto community envision is the replacement of fiat; the day no one will even have to be concerned about trading back to it, because crypto will be the dominant currency.

But even until then, everyone's fiat is essentially being converted (by simply paying x amount) for crypto. Which if you believe in crypto, marks the early stages of a massive transfer of wealth. It's letting people store, in a secure, fast-and-inexpensive-to-transfer way, their current fiat assets. Again, just by purchasing x amount of BTC, Nano, whatever. Look at it as 1:1 if you will, except as more people want it (or less people want fiat...), its value actually goes up over time.

There's no guarantee that demand keeps going up or stabilizes of course, but to that I say, so far so good. And that's how fiat's valuation is measured already with the same inherent risks.

Its not that crypto is new. The problem is the statutes on cryptos is still vague. Example: Wash sales are also not clearly defined for cryptos. It is stated in the statutes that it only applies to stocks and securities. Irs says cryptos are property. So does wash sale apply to crypto? Nobody knows.,1523762911
"People fail to understand that cryptos are not *ready* to be widely adopted. Everything is still very technical and until things are easy enough for your parents/grandparents to use, we will still be in the 'early adopters' phase. 


Just look at that one post that made it to the front page today about emails. You had to connect your phone line and call your damn computer for it to work. Hell no did anyone watch that and say ""omg the future is here!"".  Even when things became easy enough for people to use, it was *still* a pain to use. You had to wait a solid while for your internet to boot up and things were still very inconvenient.


But as soon as the UI was no longer an eyesore and things were as dumbed down as possible did the internet explode. And now? Now the internet is implemented in things that people never even thought needed it. If I told you 10 years ago that your lightbulb would be connected to your phone via the internet what would you say? You'd probably think I was pretty damn ridiculous.


And that's exactly how blockchain is but imo *better*. Our data centers right now are insecure as shit. Bitcoin on the otherhand? This ""scam""? This ""oh it's just online money""? It's essentially just this massive data center that's never been hacked and if that doesn't show the potential of what were dealing with then I don't know what does.


The point I'm trying to make is that we're **way** to early on to know what can happen or what will happen. No crypto, not even bitcoin, is guaranteed to be here 10 years from now. Ethereum, the #2 crypto that's meant to be a platform for other projects can't even do it's job because it still hasn't ironed out it's scaling. And just a while ago bitcoin couldn't even be used as it's intended purpose because fees were too high.


I have zero doubt in my mind that mass adoption will be reached. I have zero doubt that this is not just some scam or trend. Every single person, organization, etc that has talked down to crypto/blockchain has now down a complete 180 and is on board or looking to get on board. That's how I know this is serious and things are only going up from here - and yes, my money is where my mouth is.",1523762909
"I think the main argument is because you have to purchase a crypto to buy any of the others. Btc and ETH are a required gateway, if you're looking to purchase smaller alternate coins. Whereas stock can be purchased outright with fiat money. Taxing those transactions is kind of taxing an unrealized gain. That the gain when you cash out, is what should be taxed.",1523762900
Wash sales are also not clearly defined for cryptos. It is stated in the statutes that it only applies to stocks and securities. Irs says cryptos are property. So does wash sale apply to crypto? Nobody knows.,1523762779
"Im sorry to hear that and mean it from the bottom of my heart when i say that to outsiders America appears to be THE biggest shithole country going in how they look after their own citizens.... How can they even begin to think you owe $60k after cashing out $50k... its inconceivable, surely anyone with a brain would say you only owe tax on the portion that you withdrew.... This is why you dont pay taxes on crypto, once you do you are on their list and they'll keep coming after you.... ",1523762764

How much buy power in USD would need to enter the Bitcoin market for the coin to reach seven figures?,1523762563
"I want crypto to succeed as actual currency, but you do bring up some major points.  These are my ‚Äúopposing view‚Äù examples.

For your first point, you say that you disagree with Satoshi as an opinion.  This isn‚Äôt really something you should be talking about if you want people to disprove your points, as you say they couldn‚Äôt.  What makes you disagree with Satoshi?  I would agree that over time, either projects will fail or they will start to build up adoption from people who care more bout the crypto price than the fiat one, leading to more stability and more mainstream adoption.  

A 2-3% discount on every purchase does add up to a lot of saved money.  Speed would ideally be equivalent, and you have the benefit of not having to rely on a company like Visa, although most people likely won‚Äôt care too much about that aspect, just the fact that it‚Äôs cheap.

This is still early in crypto if it becomes globally adopted.  Wallets are getting easier to use for payments, and there are more secure hardware wallets that could be used for storing money.  You would keep it safe and it wouldn‚Äôt be vulnerable to much as and offline storage.  People could still create insurance for lost keys or other problems, or if you think your wallet might be accessible to someone else you send your money to a new wallet, which isn‚Äôt a difficult process.

For fungibility, in general it shouldn‚Äôt be a problem but if you have a specific situation where you don‚Äôt want people knowing how much you have for example, you can use a coin like monero.  Others will also develop features to keep up, and might add optional settings or something.

The fees and wait times for Bitcoin were never really a problem.  All that needed to be done was increase the block size, which just didn‚Äôt happen until BCH forked and fixed that.  [The predicted non cash transaction count for 2020 is around 725 billion](https://www.worldpaymentsreport.com/reports/noncash), which can be stored in 362.5 terabytes.  This is a lot of storage, but nothing that some groups don‚Äôt already use and the whole world isn‚Äôt going to start using Bitcoin immediately.  Second layers like lightning might be useful for certain types of transactions (high frequency and small value), but the majority of transactions should be able to be stored in larger blocks.

Currencies that actually upgrade to account for more use will get real adoption.  The BTC chain didn‚Äôt, and it got stuck with high fees which made real use impossible.  Especially after a bubble, new people will be wary of using the new technologies, but those who actually believe in them will use them and start to build up adoption.  There are already some merchants accepting various cryptocurrencies, and as more people learn about the ones that actually do something, the adoption will continue to grow.  It doesn‚Äôt have to happen immediately, and complete adoption means replacing the current system, which won‚Äôt happen easily, but it starts now with people beginning to actually use it.

For Bitcoin, there are more coins being created for over a hundred more years at a decreasing rate.  After that, you might not lose any money by holding it, but you still don't make what you would from investing.  If you did use your money to invest, you would be investing crypto to get more crypto.  If inflation is really causing problems at that point, people can fork or switch to something without a limit on the amount of coins.

"This reminds me of an analogy I once gave re: BTC, and other CCs to a friend who was a big Battlestar Galactica fan.  I said you know when Battlestar Galactica was humanity's only hope, leading them out of a dangerous system.  They fly ahead protecting the civilian ships, absorbing the barrage, and holding the Cylons at bay long enough for the civilians to jump to safety.  Well, BSG is BTC, and all the other CCs have to hope that BTC buys us the time to ""jump"" to safety from the dominion.  If BTC fails, all is lost.

This is why BTC doesn't need to be everything for everyone.  It needs to do one thing.  Offer a haven.  Which it does.  It should not be risked until we ""jump"", which may be after the last fiat has thrown in the towel.

Incidentally, the more advanced/networked Battlestars's complexity was used against them, and they were rendered useless.",1523762468

"Here is the problem with owing the IRS, the interest rate is unreal! In 2015 I made quite a bit and owed 450k in taxes, that‚Äôs not to mention the taxes coming out from my check. I then went on a payment plan of 15k a month, with my CPA yelling at me the whole time that it was dumb.  Well turns out he was right. I made 150,000 dollars on the payment plan and only 100k was actually applied to the taxes, I then paid the remaining balance. The best thing to do, which I learned the hard way, just pay them off, the interest is crazy, up to 25%.

"The fee you need to pay to get your transaction in the next block depends on the fees that everybody else sets to get their transaction in the next block. This is only a problem when not every tx fits in a block. With segwit this is about 12195 transactions per block. So Bitcoin-BTC has the problem that as soon as there are to many transactions per 10 minutes and they don't all fit in the blocks anymore ... certain transactions will be left out. 

This breaks the functionality of Bitcoin. If you have no certainty in knowing if or when your transaction will get confirmed unless you pay a fee higher then all the other people around that time you might as well just not use Bitcoin because then it offers a worse payment system then fiat. When paying with a credit card, you always know upfront what your fee is ... if any because a lot of times the merchants will pay for those costs. And with fiat your transaction is confirmed in a couple of seconds. For the merchant there is a risk for fraud higher then with Bitcoin .... but at least the costs and timing are predictable. 

Bitcoin Core developers broke a lot of functionality with replace by fee and by stubbornly refusing to up the block size limit even 1 additional MB.  Segwit allows for more transactions but at the cost of added complexity and the fact that now you are stuck with having to support backwards compatibility using soft forks, which really sucks from every single possible perspective. 

Together with the hostility from the core devs vs anybody that had any  other ideas or thoughts this has created a climate where core has pushed all innovation away ... except for the Lightning Network and Bitcoin being a store of value. 

The Lightning Network is trying to solve a scaling issue that does not exist and might not exist for the next 20 years, because it all depends on how popular the network get. Bitcoin can scale up to Visa levels and do a 100 million tx day. From a technical perspective this is easy. Yes it will cost the miners some money on bandwith, about 10 USD per day ... which is peanuts compared to the fee reward they will get for a 100 million tx a day.  Disk storage is not an issue. That is cheap and the blockchain can be pruned to limit the size significantly. Satoshi engineered a system that works from both the technical and economic point of view. As long as memory and disk space and CPU power all keep on growing at the same speed or faster as the demand on the network then there won't be any problems ... maybe for forever. 

So Bitcoin Core claiming: we need to solve scaling issues before we work on the adoption to run in to issues in the first place of course is idiocrazy.  

Then the only thing that Bitcoin still has to offer is store of value. Well Bitcoin is a horrible store of value, way to volatile short term and long term in depends on there being some utility. It's not because something is just scarce that it has value.  If Bitcoin does not turn in to a global payment network that offers some value to society that other money systems do not ... then eventually the market price of Bitcoin will drop to zero. 


So yeah ... while it's possible that right now you could do a transaction with Bitcoin-BTC and only pay 0.20 ... that is already close to what merchants pay per transaction for traditional payment system. And now the burden is with the customer, people forget that with the traditional system usually the merchant pays for all the cost that come with the system used while with Bitcoin it's the sender that pays for the fees. 

So why would anybody choose Bitcoin offer the traditional system if Bitcoin is way more unreliable and expensive?

And if your answer is, well Bitcoin is only for high value transactions then what good is the Lightning Network?? 

There is only so much speculation and day trading that can be done with Bitcoin until it finally implodes. 

The only way to long term succes is worldwide adoption, at least on the internet.  

Bitcoin was designed to offer a solution to a problem the internet has. No direct payments are possible with the old system, and the transaction costs are to high. Bitcoin fixes this, untill it got hijacked. Now Bitcoin is a worse solution then the problem it's trying to solve! 

Lots of people know and recognized this and it's those people that finally after many failed attempts where able to fork and get back on track with Bitcoin Cash.

If you don't get this, then Bitcoin is nice to make some quick money at the expanse of another speculant but it will never go global. Just because 10 000 hodlers all want Bitcoin to go global does not mean it will automatically happen.

Right now Bitcoin offers absolutely nothing of  value to society. And Bitcoin-BTC went in an extreme direction. Right now it offers negative value to society. Bitcoin Cash offers positive value to society. But that value needs millions and millions of people to switch away from traditional banking on to the new system.

That's not a guarantee. If that does not happen, Bitcoin Cash also offers nothing of value.

&gt; For these business experts, the hype that surrounds the market will only lead to the inevitable demise of bitcoin once the tipping point is reached, culminating in a severe crash in bitcoin prices.

&gt; If the mainstream business scene is the biggest critic of the bitcoin market, governments around the world have been the biggest opposition to the growth of bitcoin.

&gt; According to Bitcoin Bans, an online service that tracks the number of times bitcoin has been banned by government agencies around the world, bitcoin has been banned 23 times.

"Good post, but to underline your last comment, yes it depends on what you are holding.

Sure, if you're holding BCC (Bitconnect), they're very heavy bags and you've lost your money.

I am holding XRP. The current price is 17 cents below my DCA.  That represents several thousands of dollars in the red.  Sure, something catastrophic could happen to Ripple/XRP and I lose my money, but it's very unlikely that the XRP price won't *ever* surpass 82 cents in the future - given its ATH was $3.75, but moreover....given its numerous good news stories and developments going on: Western Union and Moneygram soon to go live with xRapid which is not so much for the ""newsworthiness"" as for the raw liquidity their usage of XRP will add to XRP's price.

&gt;  If you don‚Äôt think your investment is good, maybe put it into index funds or bitcoin at the very least. 

Agreed.  It can be good to hold, it can be bad to hold.  I sold all my alts in late January when the total market cap was $600Bn.  I sold because my hands were weak.  In the end, I got lucky.  But also in hindsight, I'm glad I sold a lot of those obscure alts as I only bought them with the market going up in December - you could have bought ANYTHING and made a profit then.  In hindsight,  it's far better to put your money into one or two very very solid projects with big teams behind them - makes holding a LOT LOT easier.

That's very good exposure for Bitcoin Cash. The creators would be like: hey my content is seen as valuable. They would then see Bitcoin Cash as something very positive.  The community of people here tipping is very small, so you run out of a healthy flow of tipping going around. Soundcloud is big enough that the flow of tipping might be big enough to suck in more and more people willing to buy Bitcoin Cash to support and reward their favorite creators or good quality music.

"&gt; Not everybody is paying from a wallet with a camera that can scan a QR code, 

I disagree. Every major mobile wallet has QR code support.

All they need to do is clearly label each address as either BCH or BTC. I don't believe a large percentage of users are getting confused by this. It's simply not confusing.

&gt; Don't forget, it's not just Bitpay that benefits from using Bip70, it's any service that accepts BTC, BCH, or both

Nobody benefits from Bip70 as long as the address is presented to the user through HTTPS (which is everywhere anyways).

&gt; They are playing a sound strategy here IMO, they know they have a fairly large influence in the community,

I think it's a pretty dumb strategy, personally. I was going to use Bitpay/Gyft to purchase a giftcard with BCH but not I'm not going to because my wallet can't read the payment code, and there is no fallback for wallets that don't support the pointless Bip70.

&gt; If they didn't play this strategy, there may never be a solution that gets adopted to solve their needs.

For the first 5 years of Bitcoin's life before Bip70 ever existed there was no problem sending BTC via normal addresses. There was no pressing need for Bip70, yet here we are and I'm still without a giftcard. The ecosystem doesn't need Bip70. Its solving a non-existent problem.",1523758373

Cryptocurrenccies (such as bitcoin) IMO is better suited as a store of value rather than a payment currency.

Depending on where you are 20k can take you pretty far but if it‚Äôs 20k in the u.s I imagine not, since it might not be above the federal poverty line. Look at cutting expenses, time and money management, and maybe see if you can find a role/job/training to something that pays better. It may be okay to put 200 a month into crypto but REALLY ask yourself and make sure that it wouldn‚Äôt be better spent somewhere else.

This is not meant to be harsh,  but like others have said ‚Äúinvest in yourself first‚Äù. And part of that is developing the knowledge and habits that will be useful to you.

"For those who are new, [here](https://youtu.be/eCE2OzKIab8?t=32m36s) is Jimmy Song calling upon developers to 'fork to oblivion.'

Bitcoin is the next Bitcoin...,1523756469
"&gt; I'm curious about your claim that Satoshi never envisioned this kind of attack. You can search all his writings at http://satoshinakamoto.me/ and a lot of it is about preventing tx fees from being gamed.

First, I prefer this site because it has a really nice organization scheme -

http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/

I did not mean to imply that satoshi never engaged in game theory to attempt to solve issues.

In regards to ""preventing tx fee's from being gamed"" ...you'll have to show me a quote specifically. At the top of my head, I cannot think of him discussing that topic narrowly.

He does talk a lot about miners and security. He discusses game theory about block economics a *lot*. To sum up my general knowledge on his writings on this subject, I believe his general point was -

""Miners wont do anything stupid to hurt the network because it would be against their best interests""

Clearly this is wrong. In bitcoin of 2016/2017/2018, with covert asicboost and spam attacks, there are scenario's in which miners can benefit from *hurting* the system. To understand how it hurts the system you must understand the cause and effect of miners actions in the context of this discussion. Redistribution of some wealth from bitcoin users to miners is OK under normal circumstances, they are doing a job and they should be paid.....but when fee's are $50 due to spam attacks, thats like paying your food delivery guy a $50 tip instead of $3...its rape. No one likes that, I don't believe anyone can rationally say thats a good thing.

And covert AB increases monopolies, something we already have a serious problem with. Fortunately Halong came to the rescue, bringing in some fresh competition and balancing the game a little bit.

This particular discussion is not something I've seen satoshi discuss before, obviously because it came up long after he left. I've actually never seen him talk about stuffing transactions to game the fee.

I don't know why he would, he actually thought that bitcoin would remain relatively cheap for a very long time. So it doesn't make sense that he would be thinking this way when his quotes on the record show that he thought differently about how the way fee's would pan out.

&gt;Even with people trying to game the system, they're still working the system and making it more secure.

If you hire a maid to clean your house, and she does a *really fucking good job*, but then steals your watch, are you supposed to be happy about the job she did cleaning?

I cannot ignore that while these miners are profiting from securing the network, that they are doing it in a way that maximizes the cost to the end user and revenue on their end.

Again, I see this as a problem with bitcoins design. Bitcoin *cannot* rely upon altruism in order to survive. If we cannot fix this problem, bitcoin might always be a very expensive network to use. This may not be as big a issue as we think it is, if it turns out that bitcoins biggest feature is wealth protection. It wont matter if it costs $1 or $5 or even $50 per transaction if it means securing wealth from corrupt nations. What does a $50 transaction matter when you are having $1000 stolen from you a month from a corrupt government inflating your currency?

And with LN, at least you'll only have to pay this fee once. Then you can frictionlessly spend your btc on LN without needing to pay mining cartels ridiculously gamed fee's.

They are playing a sound strategy here IMO, they know they have a fairly large influence in the community, and they don't have to ask permission to do what they need to to benefit their operations, so they've decided to push the wallets to upgrade not just for them, but for any other service who wants the advantages of Bip70.

If they didn't play this strategy, there may never be a solution that gets adopted to solve their needs.

Also worth pointing out deaths that would have occurred due to impurities in MDMA procured from less scrupulous street dealers, and of course, those people taking too much of the stuff (which soesn't even compare to the amount of people who die of alcohol poisoning due to over consumption every single day).

Had MSM not completely overreacted to the death of Leah Betts (who died from drinking *too much* water whilst on ecstasy in the 90s) then calm, rational dialogue and real scientific progress on these issues may not have been held back for nearly three decades.  We can be grateful to David Nut et al for standing firmly behind science when the Blair government asked him to retract his comments on ecstasy or face expulsion.  He said something akin to ""I'm a Scientist; I'm not going to lie to the public about my findings, no matter how uncomfortable that makes the government."" 

It must be acknowledged that Silk Road and other clean drug marketplaces have done a lot to reduce both the street violence and impurities that come with these kinds of drugs, so, contrary to the knee-jerk MSM narrative above, it is a fact that bitcoin and cryptos like monero have done a lot to save lives. 

Here's a detailed academic research paper from the university of Swansea that supports this:

[The Rise and Challenge of Dark Net Drug Markets](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/media/The%20Rise%20and%20Challenge%20of%20Dark%20Net%20Drug%20Markets.pdf)

*Key Findings*

- For vendors and purchasers who use the sophisticated, user friendly and increasingly 
secure Dark Net sites, hidden markets present **a safer environment for drug transactions 
and they reduce the multiple risks** (coercion, violence, arrest, exposure to other drugs) 
associated with ‚Äòstreet‚Äô sales.

- Research demonstrates that anonymised user forums and online chat rooms *encourage and 
facilitate information sharing* about drug purchases and drug effects, representing **a novel form of harm reduction** for drug users and an entry point for drug support services.

These studies are further backed up by University of Lausanne criminologist David Decary-Hetu and University of Manchester law professor Judith Aldridge who drew similar conclusions.  They also observed that recreational drugs such as cannabis and ecstasy were far more prevalent in these markets than more harmful drugs.

"Yeah. You still have to report all of your trades, and are supposed to calculate gain and loss on them, but if you add up all of your trades through the year they will equal out to the last trades you made minus your cost basis. 

Easy way to do this would be to look at every position you held on December 31st. From there, go back and figure out the value of the trades that it took you to get into that position. Combine the figures and there you have your answer. Sounds weird but....

For example. At end of year you hold Bitcoin, NEO, and ETH. You traded thousands of time leading up to this, but on December 31 your three holdings are those. 

Now, if you bought 1 neo at $20, 1 Bitcoin at $2000, and 1 eth at $400. The traded value of those combined is $2420. They went way higher, but those were your last trades. Any further price movement was not realized because you have sold and have not created another taxable event. So, you take the $2420 and then subtract what you initially invested and that will get you your total taxable gain for the year. 

Is that good enough for the IRS? No. They want to see every trade. But, it's good enough to get an idea of what you owe without combing through thousands of trades.",1523754198

"Ironically, this is actually the only ""spam attack"" that has occurred, and makes clear one fact of actual ""spam"" that seems to have never been made that obvious. 

Look at the history of the mempool--not in size, but in _pending transaction fees_. This reveals something critical: while the mempool might have increased in terms of size, in terms of **fees required to get onto a block in a reasonable time**, the network is running almost identically to how it would any other day. Spam attacks **don't work**, they never have worked [at least, in the terms of the kinds of things that they're accused of having done], and what has slogged down the network in the past and accused of being ""spam"" was simply the native demand for blockspace overloading the native supply of blockspace.

But, as it stands, spam does not slog the network down. It simply cannot as long as your network isn't working close to capacity, and the only way it can have _any_ meaningful impact on the ecosystem's ability to use bitcoin is it the spammer uses a massive amount of money on the fees for his transaction, outpricing other transactions. But even then, all he does is create a different baseline for a fee market, and the network will still operate as per usual above that fee baseline, which is completely distinct from the behavior of a slogged down network, where the fees rise endlessly because _increasing fees do not increase blockspace_.",1523753887

* Unit of Account (UoA)

"I am excited because the more money into Bitcoin = the more money into crypto as a whole. There is some amazing technology blossoming ‚Äì no, exploding! ‚Äì¬†out there, and the strength of Bitcoin is the strength of progress and forward momentum. Bitcoin will be the father coin for a long while to come, and everyone rests in the gentle breeze of its shadow. 

The wise form allegiance with many; only the foolish take sides.",1523750894
"&gt;BTC is largely considered a settlement currency now, it is very liquid; when its exchange rate changes ‚Äì all ‚Äòalt coins‚Äô exchange rates change too. (alt-coins are not independent on exchange rates from BTC i.e. BTC effect = all effected)

BTC is a settlement coin only as long as the cryptocurrency market stays small  enough for it to be the main base pair. This is already changing, as ETH and other coins are offered as base pairings against smaller alts and tokens. 

&gt;Why does all the best Cryptographers/mathematicians and software engineers not partake in BCH dev? (other than mostly investors &amp; minors and few developers).

A huge number of devs exited the Bitcoin community during the censorship overseen by Blockstream. These developers distributed themselves on various projects, with a large number ending up working on Ethereum. Now that BCH exists many have offered their support to the BCH community. The Parity team, Vitalik Buterin, and others have supported it by either social media posts or development. Gavin Andresen has been vocal about his support, and he was left in charge of Bitcoin originally by Satoshi himself. 

&gt;Of all the problems Roger keeps talking about in BTC - that BCH solves; are actually only the result of BTC demand outpacing its 'current' capacity today (BCH would have same problem if as popular), hence the tx fees exploded [Core devs ‚Äòhad‚Äô to keep block size to help dev of new layered tech ‚Äì to avoid centralisation ‚Äì and even if they did raise blocks, it wouldn‚Äôt be long before there where back to square one i.e. full block, again &gt; centralisation of ‚Äòfull‚Äô nodes] ‚Äì (Fee problem is only temp). (Doesn‚Äôt mention ‚Äòanything‚Äô in original ‚Äòunedited‚Äô Satoshi white paper about increasing block sizes with demand ‚Äì something Roger keeps saying should happen in that that‚Äôs following Satoshi‚Äôs vision).

 Satoshi spoke on multiple forums about increasing the block size as the demand increased although it was not in the original white paper. Regardless of capacity, abandoning on-chain scaling altogether was never something Satoshi appears to have supported, neither was using a ""peer-to-peer cash system"" as only a ""store of value"". BCH has multiple well funded projects working on global level on-chain scaling solutions. Gigabyte and Terabyte block teams are working tirelessly to address all the issues that will come with larger blocks. 

&gt;Why does it say CEO Roger Ver, if Bitcoin is not a company? (looks centralised agenda).

Roger Ver calls himself this. I can call myself the King of England, does this make it so? Honestly, who cares?

&gt;Different BCH implementations are dangerous regarding trust of the implementation/s itself i.e. bugs DoS attacks hacks etc. (With Bitcoin Core implementations, they are BIPs (community proposals) to one ‚Äòquality/secure‚Äô implementation ‚Äì having that concentrations of resources specialising on the one implementation means greater trust).

Care to elaborate on this? I don't see how the implementations are dangerous. They are open source, and have multiple different development teams. As Ethereum has shown multiple implementations is a great additional layer of security in crypto.

&gt;Are we seriously believing all ‚Äòfull‚Äô nodes are prepared to consume 10Tb+ HDD space per year ‚Äì for standard user? (particular if they are ‚Äòjust‚Äô ‚Äòfull‚Äô nodes ‚Äì no financial incentive) (Leading to large companies taking on responsibility = greater centralisation)

Hard drive capacity is increasing at an amazing rate. [Tech has already been developed that can store hundreds of terabytes easily](http://www.businessinsider.com/glass-chip-360-terabytes-5d-femtosecond-laser-2016-2)...its only a matter of time until it hits the consumer market. I suggest watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKFkhWWiLDk) video from one of the developers on the terabyte block team. 

&gt;According to the block chain technology, the longest chain is the biggest PoW; for every BCH block mined there will be BTC block mined (even if BCH mined more its not possible to historically catch up), and therefore because BTC ‚Äòis‚Äô the longest chain BCH will have to x2 BTC ‚Äòtotal‚Äô hashrate to be ahead of BTC.

This is only true as long as the miners make it so. If it becomes more profitable to mine BCH everything changes. The fundamentals of the technologies are important factors to consider in the long run. What is true today will not always be. 

&gt;In my view Id rather trust devs/engineers instead of Economists, traders and investors (ulterior interests &amp; markets are always very fickle ‚Äì because they are human emotion); just because Roger Ver is the ‚Äòfirst‚Äô investor doesn‚Äôt necessarily make him the best at advocating the argument about BCH being better than BTC argument.

This is just your opinion, so ok. 

&gt;What does BCH have to offer that BTC will offer (much better) when Segwit, LN and payment channels take off? (nothing). (Out of all the problems Roger keeps talking about ‚Äì according to ‚Äúmastering Bitcoin 2nd Edition‚Äù, the 3 developments for Bitcoin solve all these, and reduce fee‚Äôs to historic lows [in the end] and better tx‚Äôs down to ‚Äògranularity‚Äô &amp; tx's far better than any current payment processor can ever offer).

You are assuming that LN will take off. I have my doubts for many reasons. There are [reasons](https://forums.prohashing.com/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=3728) that LN won't have success being adopted on a large scale, both by companies and users. 

&gt;Though Roger Ver doesn‚Äôt like Bitcoin Core team ‚Äì that‚Äôs fine, but why have nothing good to say about the 3 technologies i.e. Segwit, Payment Channels &amp; LN? (He appears to have a very black and white view ‚Äì which makes ‚Äòme‚Äô more suspicious).

There are many arguments against [Segwit](https://medium.com/the-publius-letters/segregated-witness-a-fork-too-far-87d6e57a4179) and [LN](https://medium.com/@jonaldfyookball/mathematical-proof-that-the-lightning-network-cannot-be-a-decentralized-bitcoin-scaling-solution-1b8147650800). DYOR. 

&gt;Satoshi‚Äôs Original white paper says ‚Äònothing‚Äô about following a ‚Äòfixed‚Äô vision like Roger keeps proclaiming (‚ÄúMastering Bitcoin 2nd Edition‚Äù contains the ‚Äòabsolute‚Äô original Satoshi white paper), actually uses the words in the white paper conclusion ‚ÄúAny needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism‚Äù; in other words making changes along the way is expected. (But not according to Roger Ver). (Why is there no emergent consensus proposals before hard forking? Remember Hard forking is not backwards compatible (with older implementations) and quite undemocratic against the emergent consensus (forcing them to upgrade) i.e. the ‚Äòfull‚Äô nodes).

The same thing can be said about changing the block size. If stuff can be changed, then we can change anything. A portion of the community wanted big blocks, the other wanted LN and here we are. ",1523750878

Both addresses in question belong to the same person.

It‚Äôs an Australian lad who (while I won‚Äôt dox his IRL identity) online uses the nym ‚Äúpondsea‚Äù.

He is very involved with [KOMODO](https://www.reddit.com/r/komodoplatform) (a fork of Zcash) as well as the intimately related, soon-to-launch, ‚Äúdecentralized atomic swaps exchange‚Äù (smh) called [barterDEX](https://komodoplatform.com/decentralized-exchange/) (formerly known as [‚ÄúBitcoin Dark‚Äù] (https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoindark/). He **currently operates several KOMODO notary nodes** from servers in St. Petersburg, Russia, Montreal Canada, and Sydney Australia. 



(Remember the highlighted part for what follows)  


Last year and prior this same issue came up. 


The way their Komodo ‚Äúblockchain solutions provider‚Äù system thingy works is by encoding tx details of their originating chain in the OP_RETURN output on the BTC blockchain. 

These ‚Äúnotary nodes‚Äù are performing something that they call ‚ÄúDelayed Proof of Work‚Äù. These ‚Äúnotaries‚Äù are compensated for performing these tasks.  


Their official response (by way of [a thread on bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1808078.0)) attempted an explanation of their MO:  
 
&gt; *‚ÄùEveryone has heard of the block size debate and its proposed solutions. Whether you are a proponent of SegWit + LN or BigBlocks or some other method in-between, most all can agree something needs done. Komodo aims at tackling current and future need for storing data on a secure distributed ledger  through its scalability mechanism known as Delayed Proof-of-Work‚Äù*


continuing with:  

&gt; *‚ÄùDelayed Proof-of-Work  works by receiving submissions from third-party blockchains and recording their hashes into a Komodo Block. The blockhash of that block  is then submitted in a group-signed transaction to Bitcoin's Network through a group of elected node operators.   This signed transaction forms a ""checkpoint""  where if at a future time either a third-party blockchain or Komodo itself  becomes threatened by a malicious actor or a fork divides the community, this checkpoint system gives the operators of the respective networks a "" last known good"" block hash  from which they can start efforts of fixing their network.‚Äù*  



About the spam:  


&gt;‚ÄùThere are several in here that accuse the Komodo notary nodes in their group-signed transaction of contributing to the delays on the Bitcoin Network.  This is not the case.  First, our transactions count for well less than 1% of the current backlog. In addition they are a part of a necessary function in the SuperNET ecosystem aimed at enhancing the bitcoin networks scalability.‚Äù*  


So there you go. It doesn‚Äôt seem to be malicious per se. 

I‚Äôd classify it more as garden-variety parasitism by some weird cartel comprised of one [ridiculously prolific procrasterbating programmer](https://forum.supernet.org/t/has-james-jl777-abandoned-his-projects-in-the-past-how-many-icos-has-he-done/155/3) and his entourage of computer nerds.

"I'm mostly joking with those examples lol....But just because someone's vision is something, doesn't mean it'll continue to stay that way. Especially once the creator is gone.  When Steve Jobs was forced out of Apple they went in a different direction. Satoshi as a person (or group of people ) is either dead, or prefer to stay anonymous ( I don't blame him/her/them). So it's hard to say.

I'm not sure if you're American but many people use phrases like ""George Washington would've wanted this...or would've never wanted this to happen"" concerning guns, laws, etc...While Satoshi's whitepaper was published very recently, and very specific in his vision, we're not sure what he/she would think today with the evolution. Perhaps even Satoshi would not have imagined Bitcoin reaching 19,000 in 9 years. And maybe his mind would be changed.

And yes, bitcoin is king for now, we should not ignore it. But I like to focus on other coins as currency because like you said, bitcoin is not functioning as a currency right now (too many flaws for it as a currency).


I would prefer to buy a house or vehicle with crypto, but if that doesn't come when I'm ready to sell, so be it. I'll sell to fiat.  I would like crypto to make our lives easier. Make it so sending/receiving money with family abroad is cheaper. Smarthouses, smart cars...etc...

"You'd be amazed what anybody with a few satoshis can do...

Even if you have a wallet with just 2 satoshis it is worth making a TX that will never be accepted sending 1 satoshi to yourself.

It really is a shame that these are called satoshis because in the Satoshi protocol mempool was never ever a concept to worry about, block size would always increase to account for usage.

Obviously on the Bitcoin (Cash) network these small units should be called satoshis as they are, but I think for BCore they should be changed....

"Hey man. Thanks for replying. I initially invested 10K in May 2017. Made 25K from working a job. Cashed out 50K throughout 2017.

Highest was over 300K at end of 2017. I had a lot of ICX when it pumped.
At the current moment, I have 30K cash in my bank account and 50K on binance.

I just looked at my binance, and saw that in beginning of January, all my stack of ICX for XRP, then sold that to XLM, then back to ICX and held til now. So each of those is taxable right? The peak was 300K and now at 50K. So you're telling me I owe tax on each of those trades so the tune of a couple hundred K when I only have 50K? This is fucking insane.

Plus I see only Binance shows the Bitcoin value not the USD.

1) I found him on bitcoin.tax under the cryptocurrency CPA section, where most of his clients are filing with crypto. So he clearly knows about this stuff and all the exchanges and such, but I believe he is making me file like kind under the presumption that in a few years when the IRS has a handle on all this, they are going to back trace and start penalizing. So that's I think where he is coming from. And also under the presumption that Bittrex and Binance will become SEC/IRS compliant in efforts to capitalize on growing US interest and money into crypto. So if they do in a few years, IRS can go back and start collecting penalties for those that filed incorrectly. Again, what he said. I am ignorant here.
2) We had a discussion about this for an hour where I even mentioned the same thing, just using turbotax and paying the short term. But argument for me NOT doing that was reason 1 -&gt; in a few years, IRS will have more information and charge for fees

The thing is, he generated a form 4868 and FTB 3519 that I have to mail in with check. Obviously since I haven't sent that, I can still submit through TurboTax correct?",1523746878
"Unless they control a majority of the miners and and mine the majority of the blocks, they lose money. If they control a majority of the miners we have bigger problems and there are easier and less risky attacks to execute. With even only 30% of the miners of BTC you could execute a double spend attack on any BCH accepting exchange, tank the price, and make fortunes on shorts. This attack you're hypothesizing requires significantly more miner resources, the trust and collaboration of pools - some of which will lose money, and the perpetual maintenance cost of raising fees. I'm not saying it's impossible but if the goal is to abuse the ecosystem for cash there seem like more profitable and reliable ways.",1523746865

i thought they were buy and sell walls by their appreance on exchanges. how is this different?

this sub is pretty bad, i suggest you post this to /r/cryptotechnology id really like that, and if you could explain areas what most people wouldn't get e.g. showing the shorts / longs on the graph. 

id appreciate if you could expand on what i got wrong. i did trade stocks and thought i had a good understanding of the order book. if you could either explain what i got wrong and why in detail or link me some good resources on this id appreciate it.

I still dont understand how the graph shows longs / shorts, if you could expand on that.

Appologies for being rude in the post, i was actually quite interested because a few days ago, there was a twitter saying the most btc trade volume ever in history was recorded. this raised eyebrows to me as the market has low volumes, even with the spike in mcap the other day it doesnt justify that historic event as usually btc will just be used to buy alts or ppl buying btc as an investment to speculate.

"Catching up on some of these old r/btc threads, I have to correct you on two things. First of all, of course climate change is real. It's been changing for millennia. What's a myth is that C02 from hydrocarbons is causing it. Have you looked into the Vostok ice core samples? Carbon Dioxide _follows_ temperature increases by a few hundred years, not the other way around (when the ocean heats up, it releases C02).

Governments don't really care about the climate, anymore than they care about anything else. It's about politics. It is politically expedient; a way to get more information from people, more tax dollars, more votes, etc. If you're a scientist, you get a grant when you do a study that is in line with this stuff, not against it. That's how it works. And no, I am not in disagreement that humans are destroying many parts of the Earth; oil spills, forest fires, species extinction, water pollution, litter/garbage, over fishing, etc. But none of that has anything to do with C02. That's what's so disgusting about this whole environmental movement. Every 10 years they tell us we only have a few years before it's too late- that countries will disappear from rising sea levels, that millions will die, etc. Of course it doesn't happen, but in the meantime, the things that are actually important are ignored.

Regarding nuclear energy, I was a large supporter of it for many years. It's true that countries like France are almost entirely nuclear, and that it can be done safely. It's true that things like Chernobyl were the result of poor maintenance practices and improper design. It's true that it's cheap and abundant. All of this is true. The problem with nuclear is two-fold:

1- Most nuclear power plants can not generate electricity for themselves. This is surprising for most people to learn; that the average nuclear power plant can not maintain itself in the event of a power outage. In countries like the USA, most of them have diesel generators to run the coolant systems, should a natural disaster or other such event occur. The problem is, most of these only have enough diesel for about 10 days. In the event of a major grid collapse, such as an EMP bomb, or a solar flare (think [the Carrington Event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_storm_of_1859) in the 1860's), the entire grid would be down for months, if not years, and most electronics would be destroyed. This is what happened during the aforementioned Carrington Event, but because there were few electronics around, nobody really cared. If it were to happen today though, all nuclear power plants would go into to emergency back-up mode. But who would supply the generators with diesel? Pumps wouldn't work. Electronics wouldn't work. People would be in the streets begging for food. And you'd have hundred(s) of these things needing constant attention and energy to remain going. And if a single one of them was unable to be maintained, the plant would automatically go into an irreversible meltdown (think Chernobyl or Fukushima). What's amazing is that we know large solar flares happen about once every ~300? years or so, based off geological records. Nuclear power is simply too risky. It's not worth it.

2- The nuclear waste. Some nuclear waste has a half life of only a few decades, which is not a big problem. But others, like Plutonium 239, has a half life of 24,000 years. Think if the ancient Egyptians had had plutonium 239-producing reactors in ancient Egypt. Today, the waste from one of their plants would still have about 16,000 years to go before it became even half as dangerous. This is alarming when you think about it. Hundred(s) of these plants producing waste for even just 100 years is an enormous amount of waste, and it will all have to be kept and maintained for generations to come. If it leaks, or something bad happens, it will contaminate them. Again, as appealing as nuclear is, it's just not worth the risk. We can do better.

Viagra's unintended/eventual use addressed a very difficult problem that had very few treatments before, if any.

Can we say this of Bitcoin? No, we really can't. We've gone from what Satoshi Nakamoto highly innovative creation, to just another speculative item much like any other, that arguably offers next to nothing for society. Suffice it to say, this is not an improvement over the initial idea, nor does it add more value.

"Chainlink isn't a blockchain first and foremost, it simply provides utility to any it supports, with the initial being Ethereum. It creates a programmable interface to be able to call API's within Solidity. A simple example would be writing a ChainLink request which queries GDAX for the price of Bitcoin. You can then trigger any event you want based on that price, like paying someone or triggering another event on a different contract for example.

The real killer feature is the automatic scheduling of a smart contract. So you can tell ChainLink to query X API at a given duration to which it will then write on-chain. The beauty of that is it allows contracts to process and trigger without any human interaction, allowing Ethereum to become an automated decentralised computational platform.

The relationship also works both ways, so companies whom run LINK nodes can listen for certain contract events or payments, firing an event to internal company systems from on-chain events.

The beauty of it as well is it's adaptability. Since nodes are expandable with external adaptors, people can write their own microservices which can feed any data they have access to back to their node for anyone to use on-chain. To give some examples of that, I've wrote three adaptors for CL: XML-to-JSON, IOTA and asset price aggregation.",1523741253

"Sure, you may.
Most cash back programs are build around the premise that the one getting cash back for a certain product or service gives something up. Most of the time it is his personal data (and later on, advanced analysis of buying behaviour). That is the only value that those programs have for retailers.

That it's not a sure thing now that the price won't go to 3k. No one knows. He was acting like it absolutely can't happen. But it could. I'm not saying whether I think it will or not. I've just been involved and learning about cryptos for like a year now and the amount of predictions I've seen that have been so wrong is absurd. I remember when bitcoin dropped from 20k to like 13k and people were saying it was just consolidating there and that was the bottom. Then it dropped to like 9k and then I heard the same shit. So now it's at 8k and people are saying that this is it and it surely won't drop further. ,1523741103

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6g8fvp/dell_no_longer_accepting_bitcoin_as_payment/
* Edeka  
  Has never accepted Bitcoin as a corporation. There was at some point one franchisee of one store in Hamburg who accepted Bitcoin for his online web shop, but a) not in his physical store (Edeka is a super market chain) and b) stopped accepting Bitcoin even online when it became impractical last year. Today, you can not pay with Bitcoin anywhere in the Edeka organization.
* Alza  
  Is a Czech electronics e-commerce site. Made a [splash about accepting Bitcoin](https://www.alza.cz/bitcoin-everything-you-want-to-know) on their main sites alza.cz and alza.sk early in 2017. Eventually posted an update about high fees and this is what their checkouts look like today: [Alza.cz](https://i.imgur.com/RG2iv3f.png) and [Alza.sk](https://i.imgur.com/4QxlwKl.png). Do you see Bitcoin as a payment option?  
  Besides, [Alza's 2017 revenue was 820m Euros](https://www.alza.cz/history-present-art141.htm), which at the end of 2017 was USD 982m. The exchange rate was highest at the end of the year, so at any time earlier during 2017, it would have been even less in USD. It fails your &gt; $1bn threshold.

There is some demand for storing arbitrary data on the bitcoin blockchain, e.g. the hash of a document so that it can be proven later that the document already existed at a certain time. However, the blockchain needs to store this data forever.

To reduce the burden of storing this data a bit, [OP_RETURN](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/OP_RETURN) is used to create provably unspendable outputs with some data, which can be safely ignored when checking transactions against the set of unspent outputs.

If bitcoin doesn't push past 8.2k then there is the possibility that it might revisit the 7.5-7.8k range.

The buying pressure has been strong for the last two days since the 'great spike' from $6.8k, however, I trust a slower climb more than a sudden elevator, and while I expected a recovery the coming days and weeks, the acuteness of the angle of that rise was a surprise. As for bullish sentiments the overall confidence levels have increased dramatically; even if the price were to fall a few hundred dollars due to temporary high sell pressure, the price would likely bounce back up relatively soon, or at least stabilize and then trend upwards.

"Looking at things objectively, Satoshi Nakamoto invented Bitcoin to be a usable currency, which could potentially replace fiat currency. To shift away from that goal would be to shift away from why Bitcoin was created in the first place. Of course, one of the reasons why people are letting go of the idea of Bitcoin being a usable currency, is because it scaled horribly under mass adoption last year. 

As a fallback to justify it's reason for existing, some are proclaiming it as a store of value like gold, yet is that really accurate? Many would say no, given how the masses now choose to interact with BTC on a daily basis. Today, BTC is largely used as a platform for speculative trading, closer to that of stocks than gold. Admitting BTC has become a mere platform for speculation is a bitter pill to swallow, therefore some in the community are trying to sell the store of value angle, which sounds less dirty and reliant on fiat as an output.

I've seen too many smart people who could do great things for bitcoin stay away from it (and not take the steps to understand the technology, which I know would get them excited if they did) purely because of the only thing they ever see about it being how many dollars/euro/yen a bitcoin can be exchanged for and how various political events might influence that figure.

"&gt;BCH isn't attempting to impersonate bitcoin

* This sub is named /btc
* Roger abuses the bitcoin.com domain
* Bitcoin twitter.

I dont think that is decent behavior

&gt;BCH is a fork not only in code, but in vision and community

I agree with that, but you guys have to make your own identity instead of trying to steal bitcoins identity. 

&gt;If you have any questions about whether or not big blocks can scale or any other technical/economic question about the difference between BTC and BCH, ask away.

I have nothing against the technical solutions of BCH, I think forks are usefull for the experiment. I think 0 conf is a benefit above btc, although its not the best solution, its a good example of development I want to see.

I dont think that just make bigger blocks is the solution to scaling, blocks an sich are a problem for many real life usecases, no matter how big. I think 8 mb is perfecly reasonable with curren tech though.
 I like segwit, I used it from the beginning and really saw my fees go down because of it. I am curious, but also critical to LN. I can see it working out because there could be so much new development on lightning, things which would not work well onchain are possible in theory. 

In a perfect world for me BCH would be the perfect combination with BTC as a duo for me: BTC as the most secure, most decentralized, but because of that, with a feemarket.  And BCH as a payment layer above btc. You keep most of your funds in BTC, and just exchange some of it in BCH for spending. BCH is less secure, and less decentralized, so it makes sense that its cheaper to use, its a ""cheaper"" product because of those 2 reasons. 

I dislike the frontmen of BCH, all of them have dubious pasts and I really dislike their characters and behavior.

And I dislike most people here on the sub because they rather talk about how much btc sucks instead of how bch can mature and get its own identity. You, the community creates the real value of a coin and the discussions here and not so valuable on average. 

Let me tell you how this will play out:

BCH failed so far, It tried to replace bitcoin and the overwhelming majority of the community, users, miners, devs and even the financial sector choose BTC. Its not because bigger blocks, its only because the bad frontmen and toxic behavior the supporters. BCH will survive with its own identity at some point, your community will demand the frontmen to step down, or they will turn on you when the price will drop way more, lets say 0.04 btc. It will happen becasue neither the community nor the frontmen will stop till it hurts too much, and both parties will choose money over principle at some point.

It will never, ever replace BTC for real.

"Hey, it's me, the guy who made all these responses last night (same account, my only account). I am only an observer. I have no skin in the game, except that I want crypto in general to succeed, and I think dishonest tactics like the ones I reacted to are doing it a huge disservice. 

First off, I apologise for the vulgarity. I am not incredibly proud of this reaction, though I do stand by it as at least an honest one.

Let me take a step back and explain what I think and feel, without resorting to attacks.

So... I've been lightly following this new industry for a while and when the fork happened, not being one to take sides quickly, I decided to follow both communities, and see how it plays out. I certainly wasn't on one team or the other, and actually it's safe to say that I'm still not. After months of watching though, I've become increasingly disgusted by the deceptive tactics that the BCH community uses and promotes.

1. This community (look at the sidebar) actively misleads new users about what most people mean when they say ""bitcoin"". This is a huge one, and of course you know it. You might believe (and you might even be right) that the technical decisions taken by BCH mean it's closer to the original vision, but regardless, actively misleading people by referring to your own coin as ""bitcoin"" instead of ""Bitcoin Cash"" is short sighted and unethical. To think what damage that does to crypto alone is horrendous. 

2. The amount of reality disconnect in this sub is ridiculous. You guys sound like flat earthers, and EVERYONE THAT LOOKS AT YOUR SUB GETS THAT IMPRESSION. It does not inspire confidence, in BCH or in crypto in general. I can't help but be amazed at some of the theories and justifications that I see every day here. 

3. You /u/where-is-satoshi. You are also /u/satoshiwarenq. The owner of the green suzukis using several accounts to try to push a false narrative. The only comments of mine you excluded from this post are the ones where I pointed that out. I've known since the first post I saw from you (from another account), just because the language you use is so transparent (if I see it, others also see it). Also, you often start the post with ""*Spotted* in Northern QLD/Townsville/whatever!"". Another user pointed out that you are *the moderator and sole poster at /r/SatoshiWare/*. You also comment on your own posts and agree with yourself (just like you did with this one). This offends me not as a ""core troll"" but simply as a human. No one like bullshit. Not me, not ""core trolls"", not new users. No one. We all see it and it registers.

Why can't this community simply concentrate on their own coin like everyone wishes they would? I don't even know that it wouldn't be great! It might be fucking amazing, and a compliment to the crypto ecosystem. You might even show everyone in the end that you were right, and that bitcoin core made the wrong choice (or choices). I honestly would wish you all the luck in the world if you would just pursue that goal, instead of doing what you're doing.

Bottom line: If you really believe in this, then you have nothing to gain from deceptive tactics. Just be a good sport and show everyone.

Once again, I'm sorry for the vulgarity. I hope you can all be honest and admit that there's a reason why people generally, not just ""core trolls"", might see this behaviour worthy of such a response.

"&gt; What about Arm?

ARM is a company that only sell core IP, the general idea how a CPU looks like and operate.

CPU makers (Qualcomm, NXP, STM...) make the chip, and integrate any extra features they want. The chip design is always closed source. Logic gates and memory arrays are often hidden with a mask layer, so without very complicated and expensive equipment you cannot guarantee what is really inside. Thus you have to trust the chip maker.

There's a reason why every chip installed in [mission-critical applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Outside_the_Box#Electronic_warfare) is individually examined by x-ray. Imagine if Bitcoin ever gains worldwide adoption: governments would make Bitcoin obsolete by using a Stuxnet-like virus which would steal coins from people on a massive scale, so it would make Bitcoin unsafe for use, because no computer would be safe to store Bitcoins. And you have to use a computer to move coins, right? 

If it's possible to [install malware on an air-gapped machine in a nuclear facility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet), then, why it would be impossible to do the same with cold wallets used by exchanges or government central banks? Physical gold bars suddenly seem like a safe storage.

&gt; How do you reconcile the two?

Perfect security is impossible. ""Secure-based processors"" and ""secure enclaves"" are easier to be broken into by LE, because their hardware backdoors are straight-forward and easy to implement by agencies. In case your adversary is this equipped, nothing can replace physical security and keeping the computer device in a safe and/or unknown place. 

On the other hand, data stored in normal EEPROMs and on hard-drives can be hashed/encrypted by software, and this kind of data storage is safe and mostly unbreakable. Data can be read from the device at anytime, but it's useless because it's encrypted. The risk is then on the users themselves. Humans can expose the passphrase or private keys by extortion, truth drugs, blackmail, etc.

By using a general purpose chip and relying on software safety, at least:

1. You think about security and educate yourself, which is way better than blindly believing in something.

2. You do not overpay for your solution (e.g. ""secure"" EEPROMs and CPUs are more expensive than regular EEPROMs and CPUs, so your final product won't be competitive)

3. You are storing sensitive data in hashed or encrypted form, which is better than storing sensitive data as plaintext in a ""secure"" chip and trusting this chip's internal closed-source hardware protection.

"By all means, show me a community who blindly praises USD, or tells you to 'hodl' Eur, or who is generally rabid against anyone who dares to not share the view that Bitcoin isn't the future. ",1523730012
"I see a bubble that has popped with eerie similarities to other bubbles. There's a significant difference between the crypto bubble and the dotCom bubble though in that the coins/tokens model aren't *investments*. 

You're not getting a slice of a growing company for your money. You're not getting shareholder dividends. You're not getting a say in the direction of the company through holding votes as a shareholder. You're not getting any protection from outright scams either. You're getting coins and tokens, at a discount if you pay upfront in ICO, on the basis that the either company may find some use for them in the future to make them useful or that some chumps will rush to buy the *currently useless* tokens from you post-ICO.

Of course some of the companies involved in crypto will find useful usecases, solve real world problems and deliver real world value. My own perspective though is that the coins/tokens will NOT be where the money goes when it comes to backing these companies. It'll go in via VC deals and later public IPOs which will make the companies valuable as investments, but not the coins/tokens they've distributed.

It'll be akin to people buying into Blizzard as an investment, not buying into World of Warcraft gold as one. 

We will see how it turns out, of course. I'm willing to be wrong. I've traded coins/tokens and obviously believe there's still some drop to go, but I'll likely trade them again simply because of the level of speculative gains possible in the short term as people continue to speculate on technology that is largely overhyped and has yet to prove even a basic usecase.

"&gt; You think it's a bitcoin hater spamming the network?

From the [LaruentMT article posted by OP](https://medium.com/@laurentmt/good-whale-hunting-d3cc3861bd6b) -

&gt;These charts confirm that only 7 mining pools have played an active role during the 8th wave: 1Hash, Antpool, BitClub Network, BTC.com, HaoBTC, Kano CKPool and ViaBTC.

These are those who are complicit in this behavior. We all know who is involved with these pools. Clearly there is collusion going on behind the scenes, with company coordination, to collect as much of the spent fee's as possible, to minimize the cost of this behavior and maximize the potential revenue generated by increased fee's.

Watch the documentary on MIT card counting. Pretty much the same plan. If you coordinate with a large enough group, and you spend enough money, with the data known (how many cards/how many blocks/hashpower) there can be a mathematical solution to predicting chance and therefore revenue.

Some of these pools might loose, but overall if they collude they are all going to win big.

"From another post touching on the subject of taxation, because unfortunately there are way too many posts on r/bitcoin in which people seek and obtain tax advice from others on reddit: ""I heartily encourage and indeed demand that you go do your own damn homework, seek legal counsel (e.g. a tax lawyer), and verify independently of reddit what the heck is going on.""  I follow my own advice, and retain legal counsel for things touching a legal sphere. Nobody should believe personal interpretations of random individuals on reddit, including mine or anyone else's, as counsel, they should find out for themselves with the guidance of their own (preferably legal) counsel. 

It's worth pointing out that people's situations are different.  Go find some well-respected, well-recommended (either one of these) tax advisor, CPA and preferably tax lawyer -- the tax lawyer is probably best (if you're looking at large-ish sums). Depending on your country, how you have them stored, if you've ever even traded, what vehicle you have used to store / legally shield your assets, and so on, there will be huge differences in your situation and how this will be handled.

There are a lot of schmucks out there hawking their ""services"" on reddit and even more people who think that by opining on reddit their own P.O.V. about crypto taxation they are doing everyone a vast service.  They aren't.  Analyze this stuff on your own, do you your own homework, and obtain legal counsel to figure out how to proceed.

STOP LISTENING TO PEOPLE ON REDDIT.  (Maybe that last sentence, please take that as advice, and the part about seeking your own counsel too, definitely follow that.  But please stop listening to whatever people are yakking about here on this subject.)",1523728484

"**Decimal separator**

A decimal separator is a symbol used to separate the integer part from the fractional part of a number written in decimal form.

Different countries officially designate different symbols for the decimal separator. The choice of symbol for the decimal separator also affects the choice of symbol for the thousands separator used in digit grouping, so the latter is also treated in this article.

It is often referred to by various other generic names, e.g., decimal mark, decimal marker, or decimal sign, or after the regional representation, e.g., decimal point.

"I'm a journalist in the space \(I write for CCN and Cryptoglobe at the moment, as well as some blogs like Crypto Is Coming\). 

I think most major crypto outlets are just reporting each other's breaking news right now, because I see the same repackaged articles everywhere. That happens in mainstream media as well, and I actually have no problem with it \- different perspectives from different outlets with different agendas is great, and it would be weird if an outlet didn't cover a major story because someone else already had.

The issue is that there isn't the same infrastructure that mainstream media has in the crypto space for contacting influencers and getting original and exclusive content. Most of the time that stuff comes from Bloomberg or somewhere first. 

Personally, I don't even have a press pass, I think a lot of crypto journalists don't. Like the tech side of things, we're just in the early days, and it takes time for outlets to build the credibility and connections that will encourage leading figures to go to a crypto\-specific outlet instead of Forbes, Bloomberg, etc with their exclusives. 

Coindesk does seem to do a lot of sponsored content, which I'm not a fan of, and the quality of writing is definitely better on some sites than others, but at the moment it's either breaking news or very niche op\-ed topics, and they can pop up anywhere. I read a lot of different sites \- I'm curious about DNN, I'll be checking that out when it launches to see if they can pull off fighting fake news with blockchain. Other than that it's a mixed bag!

In my country, we have a long standing history of nobody's becoming champions in the financial sector. I understand that things like that would make you frown, however, the ""fanboy"" was correct in his assesment. 
Imo, this is exactly what's wrong with crypto. Alot of people are basing their investments off of emotional responses to a product, and believe it to be a logical conclusion that they would buy. Not saying you're one of those, but in general, people base it off of reddit communities etc etc. Head over to /r/vertcoin and take a look at what they're writing:

"The Bitcoin mempool is the pool of unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions on the Bitcoin network. Once a Bitcoin transaction happens on Bitcoin‚Äôs blockchain, it is not immediately added; instead, it goes into this pool of in-motion transactions.

Each running full node on the Bitcoin network is connected to this mempool, especially the miners. The miners, working at their respective nodes, collate a bunch of transactions from this mempool, and then they try to solve an energy-intensive math problem.

The collection of these transactions is called a ‚Äúblock‚Äù, and whichever miner first solves the math problem gets to add this block to Bitcoin‚Äôs blockchain. This is the first confirmation of that block.


Bitcoin‚Äôs block time is 10 minutes, but we all experience extreme delays from time to time in getting our transactions confirmed.

"I just saw this comment, and I'm sorry for the late reply.

I'm not sure beta really applies to anything I named other than itself and ethereum.

If you're going to apply beta to the ERC20 tokens, that would be due, mostly, to ethereum's movement.  Even then, I think interest in tokens may be the alpha here.

Feel free to correct me, but my general view of cryptoeconomics leads me to think that Bitcoin isnt as much of a factor on the space as it used to be.  It's still ""the coin you know"", but I'm not certain that it's got much else going for it in 2018 without pulling off some unforeseen miracle.

What can Bitcoin do (ideally) that I'm overlooking?",1523723510
Why is a bitcoin a good store of value? So it's not easily mined anymore? That has to do with the hashrate on the network. Gold can make sense as a store of value but not crypto I've never understood this comparison.,1523723508

But again, this has NOTHING to do with who is ""working on BCH"".  This is about who the BCH community promotes and puts on stage.  

Lots of people ""work on BCH"" in the background, without being on stage.  

In fact, Real Satoshi operated anonymously, and was able to create Bitcoin, birth the cryptocurrency universe, and change the world with a whitepaper we all read.

Blockchain works great at a low tps, we all know now that blockchain rails at high tps.  The Tangle struggles with low tps but actually works at high tps.  And there's no miners, and no fees.  So just to recap, they are a non profit in Germany trying to be as legit as possible with a brand new technology that actually has shown to work very well if you decide to look into it, miners with conflicting interests, no fees, PoW gets easier as more people use it instead of harder and it can actually unlike blockchain.

"Craig and nChain have been great teachers for me.  I have followed him on slack and he taught me a lot about how Bitcoin works and helped me better understand the political divide of the blocksize debate.  Here is a great paper you need to read if you have not: https://nchain.com/en/blog/proof-work-relates-theory-firm/

I think its the most important and enlightening thing I have read on Bitcoin ever.  We need people to lead and teach and educate the community about how Bitcoin works.

I have been working hard in the political battle and information war on Bitcoin Cash.  I was one of the first to advocate for BCH and [even predicted BCH before it existed](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/68jja0/dont_forget_money_and_bitcoin_are_just_a_ledger/dgyysp0/).  I was very influential in getting tip bots back into the community. I lobbied hard for it, and even donated 1 BCH to an early tip bot creator which preceded tippr but unfortunately closed down.  Then I [reserrected the Tipping Tuesday trend](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7179cq/bitcoin_cash_tipping_tuesdaypost_here_in_this/) and gave away large amounts of BCH to newbs, I helped newbs everywhere I could.  Even creating the /r/beginnerbitcoin subreddit in response to censorship in the other sub.  I studied slack channels and debates and discussions and papers including many from Craig Wright, and I archived much of it on pastebin.  [Here is an example](https://pastebin.com/MfRr3kt6).  I helped [expose how Bilderberg/AXA and the CIA](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7d02ee/some_thoughts_about_the_possible_bitcoin_segwit/) are manipulating our community. I tirelessly fought the political battle here making this sub successful.  I poured my heart and soul into Bitcoin from the early days and now into Bitcoin Cash.  I went all in on Bitcoin and Liberty a long time ago, and did the same with Bitcoin Cash and have 100% of my net worth in BCH.  I have been very effective and influential at making BCH a success, much more than you.",1523720475
"&gt;Surely our best days are ahead not behind us

The conditions that triggered an $800bn cap DO NOT EXIST anymore. Further, most people who were screaming at their friends and family that crypto is a bubble and a scam have now been almost entirely validated.

Institutions are looking at use cases for block chain tech, they're not looking at dumping stupid money into XVG or TRX or even BTC. Some large traders such as Soros are looking at ways to get into crypto and absolutely wreck the average person including everyone on this sub.

So when you have BTC, you can always identify/find alts that are underpriced and get in at a really good price.  So it is simple.  Hold alts, take profits, transition into BTC, buy underpriced alts, repeat the process.  ",1523720174

But as Mike Hearn noted, the Bitcoin Cash community is starting to resemble the Bitcoin community of 2014.

Yup, this also defeats the purpose of crypto*currency*  for almost everyone who uses currency as well (because banks in the western world *are* trusted to look after your money).

"LN was not designed with the thought that user would be running LN nodes. The uptime requirement and monitoring requirements are simply too high for the causual user to comply with.


Instead exchanges and banks will run LN nodes. The end user will have to deposit coins into these providers exchanges or bank to make use of the LN. And as the montra goes, if you don't hold the private keys, you don't actually own the coins, so here's hoping their security is okay. 


Beyond this there will be likely be transaction fees that these exchanges and banks tack on in excess of the LN transaction fees. It cost money to run banks and exchanges and keep your coin secure. I doubt the end user will ever see naked LN transaction fees.


These banks and exchanges can then do the doubious this that banks do by creating coins via loans and interest. This is okay until the market crashes and loans enmass become due. It's hard to pay these loans when the sum total of the outstanding loans and fees exceeds the number of coins in circulation.

Bad news doesn't really end up circulating as much because of its effect on the price. If it does inevitably circulate, people try to cook up something positive with it.

Cryptocurrency communities in general end up being pretty shit for this reason. People have too much vested interest to engage in more honest discussions.

"Ha.  Appreciate the black mirror reference :)

What you're essentially discussing is the tradgedy of the commons.

This is why ethereum and the alt coin ecosystem was created, in other to keep busy those that don't understand the responsibility and duty of care that comes with this technology.  Few 'specialists' truly understand the complex socio-economic problems bitcoin was invented to solve, including some of those cypherpunks that latched onto it in the early days who have since moved onto other alts.  As such, bitcoin is far more dependent upon generalists who have a broad understanding of everything it touches, and the perils therein. 

Underneath everything happening in bitcoin is a group of highly motivated individuals who have been involved in disruptive technology for many decades, who were deeply concerned about the state of the world before they realised bitcoin was *the* solution.  They also realised of course, that just as with the internet, releasing this upon the world would create a prolonged periods of chaos as the ecosystem and world at large reconfigured itself to cope with the new adjacent possible.

Whilst the 'blockchain' ecosystem appears chaotic to the causal observer, the networks of collaboration within bitcoin itself have only grown stronger and more diverse as time has gone by.  

As such, the myriad 'backup plans for backup plans for backup plans' many are thinking about 24/7 will ensure bitcoin keeps evolving wayyyy ahead of any who seek to subvert it.

In the end, it all comes down to trust and belief in each other to do good with all this.  That belief is way more important than the technology (which is just a tool).

I also agree that the lengths to which advertisers go to manipulate certain groups (especially children, the vulnerable) is despicable.

After monitoring everything very closely the last 3 days while Bitcoin rose some and dropped some along with my coin I could have bought back at any time and still wouldn't have lost anything.  So my observation is, if I were to sell any of my coins for BTC during a pump, it would be pretty hard to lose any of those coins as long as you have patience.  As long as you are in BTC, if it goes up you the alt may go up with it and if BTC goes down your alt is going down with it.  With the exception of your alt getting added to Coinbase or partnering with Amazon all you have to do is just hold the BTC until your alts Sat value dips which it always eventually does and add more to your stack without adding any extra fiat.

"Do you have anything positive to say about nChain and Craig Wright?  What do you think of this paper [proof of work as it relates to theory of the firm](https://nchain.com/en/blog/proof-work-relates-theory-firm/)? I thought it was very enlightening and important to understanding how Bitcoin works and the political divide over blocksize limitations.  Showing how POW resists oligarchy, and the small block crew want to turn the system into a mesh network democratic node voting system which would only degrade into oligarchy.  Do you think this paper has value?  We can argue about Craig Wright's persona and the satoshi drama all day, but honestly its not something I care about.  I care about ideas, and I feel like you and others are forcing people out of the community based on personas and not ideas.  So what do you think of the paper, and do you have anything positive to say about nChain and Craig?  Or can you only say negative things? If only you can say negative things, its very suspect as to why you are so one-sided.

You can accuse me of being one-sided, but its not the case, I simply support common sense truth and reality.  I do worry about nChain becoming too strong a force like BlockStream one day.  I have seen csw echo similar concerns, [he doesn't want to be king](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1_gxvx_QGo&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=57m32s), so any of the so-called evidence against him doesn't matter anyways, it could have been fabricated to get people to look away and not worship him. Nchain has also said they want to release the patents for BCH only and encourage others to build, this will also help prevent the king mentality.  They also hold BCH coins so they are incentivized to see it succeed unlike blockstream. Craig has proven privately to prominent people like [Ian Grigg](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6lfz1o/ian_grigg_says_craig_wright_and_dave_kleiman_was/), [Gavin Andresen](http://gavinandresen.ninja/satoshi), and [Jon Matonis](https://medium.com/@jonmatonis/how-i-met-satoshi-96e85727dc5a), all vouched for him being Satoshi, based on cryptographic **as well as other evidence**.

"It's a bit unfair to credit only Rust and Ristretto with the speedup -- in fact, the bulk of it comes from the use of AVX2 and some comes from the fact that the Ristretto benchmarks start from proofs represented by full points rather than compressed ones, both of which result in unfair comparisons. Correcting for these, the speedup for verifying a 64-bit rangeproof is about 17% [*], which is still a phenomenal result. I think the authors weaken their claim by conflating the speedup from hardware accelleration with the speedup from their own optimizations.

This 17%, as best I can tell, comes from a combination of using flat vectors to store the exponents in the multiexponentiation, which unfortunately has a nontrivial memory cost, and the use of Rust, which eliminates a lot of callback logic that compilers have trouble optimizing through. This is especially impressive because the underlying crypto primitive library, `curve25519-dalek`, actually has worse performance than libsecp for both scalar operations and batch scalar-point multiplying.

The code is much smaller than clearer than that in libsecp (thanks again Rust!) and the [documentation is phenomenal](https://doc-internal.dalek.rs/ristretto_bulletproofs/notes/index.html#range-proofs-from-inner-products).

Once a decent percentage of transactions occur off-chain, the mining incentive still needs to exist. If BCH uses LN, this will be an issue for them. If they don't use LN, scaling/trust will be an issue for them. No problems have been solved here.",1523715721

"**Monetary base**

In economics, the monetary base (also base money, money base, high-powered money, reserve money, outside money, central bank money or, in the UK, narrow money) in a country is defined as the portion of a commercial bank's reserves that consist of the commercial bank's accounts with its central bank plus the total currency circulating in the public, plus the currency, also known as vault cash, that is physically held in the bank's vault.

The monetary base should not be confused with the money supply which consists of the total currency circulating in the public plus the non-bank deposits with commercial banks.

"Hi xithy,

&gt;you post this shit

I don't post shit, but facts. And I call out bullshit.

&gt;He did rephrase the wording in the text.

The wording in a mathematical proof amounts to less than 10 words. The mathematical formulas make up the proof. 

&gt;This is rephrasing and it counters the argument that Craig didn't cite because 'he wanted to save time'

This is mathematical proof, hence not rephrasing. I never said he did it to ""save time"". I have only said that 

1) This is only one of the theorems used to prove that Selfish Miners lose both revenues and profit;
2) The theorem itself, ""selfish miners lose both revenue and profit"" is new and not plagiarised;
3) One citation is missing in the **paper draft** pertaining one of the sub theorems used to prove that selfish miners lose both revenue and profit. Missing citations in drafts are not fraud. It is called a **draft** for a reason.

&gt;The work developed by liu&amp;wang is the central part of his 'contribution'

Existing theorems are used to prove new theorems all the time. liu&amp;wang's theorem is one of the theorems employed in CSW's proof that Selfish Miners lose both profit and revenue. CSW's '**contribution**' is not the liu &amp; wang theorem, but proving that selfish miners lose both revenue and profit.

Conclusion:

1) There is no fraud
2) CSW has proven that selfish miners lose both revenue and profit. Peter &amp; Co. instead of trying to refute the conclusion focus on a missing citation about a subtheorem to discredit the proof presented against anyone claiming that bitcoin is non incentive compatible.",1523715255
"The amount of people who thinks this is actual ""money printing"" is sad. 

It's an adjusted monetary base. Look at the damn [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_base) before you start commenting on it.

&gt;The monetary base should not be confused with the money supply which consists of the total currency circulating in the public plus the non-bank deposits with commercial banks.

Furthermore, this graph means [basically nothing](http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/08/03/the_monetary_base_is_irrelevant.html) (at least that you would use as bitcoin propaganda)

&gt;On the one hand you have tight money advocates who say that the Fed has printed oodles of money. What the chart shows is that they haven't really. Or, rather, all the money that's been created is sequestered from the actual economy and may as well not exist for most purposes.

"To understand how verge works, just look at ""Wraith protocol"" that does not exist, it was just a hypeword for optional stealth adresses from 2014. Something that any coin can use. It's a wallet level feature, not protocol level. They are also worthless for privacy, especially if they are optional. ""So the only difference with stealth addresses is essentially to move the chore of producing a unique address from the server to the client. Indeed, in some ways stealth addresses may be worse, since very few people use them, and if you are known to be one of them, it will be easier to connect stealth transactions with you.

It doesn't provide ""100% anonymity"". The fundamental anonymity weakness of Bitcoin remains - that everyone can follow the chain of payments, and if you know something about one transaction or the parties to it, you can deduce something about where those coins came from or where they went.""

"&gt;Below 51%, they're not just benefiting the network, they are also benefiting themselves through criminal acts, 

The fact that it benefits themselves doesn‚Äôt matter for the network.

It is actually better that this stolen computational power is use to secure cryptocurrencies than to otherwise nefarious attack (like large scale DDoS for example)

&gt;The problem is the skewed incentives. ASICs minimize the impact of such skewed incentives, 

What exactly are those skewed incentives?

&gt;which is why they offer strictly better security, even if at the possible cost of some decentralization.  

Lower decentralisation directly mean loss of security.

&gt;Again not true, unless you are simply not defining the scope of the discussion. On an arbitrary ASIC-resistant crypto, you would not need 100's of millions of computers, 

Yes small cryptocurrencies could potentially be 51% attacked by large botnet.

Though it is likely much more profitable to mine Monero with a botnet than 51% a small cryptocurrency. (How to profit from a 51% attack?)

Incentives.

Remember that those botnet operators have access large amounts of power.. before cryptocurrency the only way to make a return on that was to launch large attacks on websites, now this power is turned toward PoW. 

I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised mining botnet are a net positive regarding overall internet security.

&gt;many have been manipulated by vastly smaller bot armies already.  

Any link?

&gt;If you're talking about a non-ASIC-resistant crypto, you're making my point for me. 

Well there is no botnet on ASIC friendly cryptocurrency.

But botnet is not really a threat to cryptocurrency so this not really advantageous.

ASIC friendly cryptocurrency However can be effective against what I would call ¬´¬†government botnet¬†¬ª; massive government supercomputers combined might be enough to 51% monero but Bitcoin for example is out of reach (not done the calculation but I think it is correct)

My favorites are mostly platformers like eth and neo but got pretty much all others as well (except Tron, but i did make a lot trading it)

I do however consider many projects unsafe investments as they have unlaunched and unproven products. It scares me that these get large valuations nonetheless. For example it boggles my mind EOS, TRX and ADA are in the top 15. For this, if you would choose a platformer, I'd recommend NEO far more than these. NEM doesn't get much marketing either but since I work with devs a lot they all say coding on NEM is a bliss compared to other. 

As for the currencies: I have both BTC&amp; BCH, LTC, nano, iota (have my concerns on this one though), and some privacy ones (Monero, zen, nav). Even have some Doge and reddcoin. For what its worth, I still think BTC should be your largest portfolio holding. I hold the same amount in BCH too, but from an economic standpoint, the market treats it as an alt (higher volatility etc) Personally have a lot of Kucoin shares (about 10k) as well for long term holding. Obviously BNB as well, desperately need those for cheaper trading. 

Some midcap coins I hold: GNT, BAT, FCT, LINK, TKY,
Some lower cap promising ones include; WaBi, Trinity (neo scaling), MOD, QLC. 

I'm sure i'm missing a lot still but I think most you get off it is that I don't prefer the pump&amp;dump projects with BS marketing (fucking tron and XVG) but try to follow those with actual development. A lot of money is still to be made in crypto, don't follow the greedy path and risk it one projects that promise so much but don't deliver.

**Scronty tells in great detail they were using email addresses @rcjbr.org back in 2008 (discussing the bitcoin whitepaper) but that domain was only registered in november 2011** 

So yes, that's just fan fiction

Detailed explanation follows, copied from an eralier post of mine elsewhere....

In this narrative, Scronty, is speaking with (2) and (3) (CSW and Kleiman)

There are two inconsistencies in all this

&gt; 12th March 2008 (2) asks (3) to help with his white paper and code.

See my thread here: https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/80fzhw/craig_s_wrights_email_to_dave_kleiman_is_provably/

The fact that this email is taken as granted already makes everything less plausible

More importantly, around April 2008 Scronty wants a new domain to be used for email addresses

He tells Kleiman to ask CSW to create this domain

&gt; I told (2) via (3) to generate a new TLD ( Top Level Domain ) for us to use for correspondence 

He then gives the example of the existing cjb.net, where he was then hosting scrontsoft.cjb.net, as a generic domain.

The domain that is registered is rcjbr.org:

&gt; He came back after obtaining rcjbr.org and creating two email handles for us.

Scronty starts using this domain for emailing, but is disappointed with the chosen domain:

&gt; In my very first direct email to (2) I said, ""You were supposed to create emails using rcjbr.net, not rcjbr.org !""

**Scronty is telling us that in the very first email he wrote to CSW, he was speaking about the domain rcjbr.org.**

The problem is, the domain is in effects owned by CSW but was only created on november 2011, and it was never registered before.

"Decentralisiation is better in a situation where no-one trusts each other to even agree on fact. A situation where everyone is constantly trying to scam and fleece each other and can't even agree on what ""truth"" is unless it's in the blockchain. A situation where people are so untrusting of each other they can't even trust escrow or other third parties.

For everything else, centralisation makes more sense. 

Even in the blockchain situation, a large enough group may 'decide' that the longest chain isn't valid and just agree that someone else's chain isn't valid, cutting them out. This has happened before (post-DAO eth, any hard fork protocol changes, etc) and will happen again.

Bitcoin does most of what it was designed to do, it is a trust-free protocol for the exchange of tokens that can represent cash. 

It suffers from low transaction throughput (made worse by *later* artificial limiting of block size). However the one place it in some way failed was artificial scarcity. The whole block-chain can be duplicated and forked to just double the circulation of money and that's not something that Satoshi considered. He thought that the longest chain would always win because the protocol said it would, he didn't consider that both chains may end up valid because of politics.

It's like the new Ghost Busters movie in that it is an altered version of the original to meet the current market demands.   At the time of inception, this coin was filling a real demand by crypto enthusiasts.  Unfortunately, the BCH team has gone off the deep end claiming they are the true Bitcoin.  

Roger Ver was not a developer of the coin but he has been a huge investment force and most certainly is guiding the marketing of this altcoin.  Personally, I would support the project more if there wasn't a blatant attempt to hijack Satoshis shine.  At this point, I am surprised they didn't call the coin Bitcoinz to even further confuse people.

This approach seems quite straightforward although miners should be properly incentivized to keep orphans (header is enough at this stage). l know for sure Ethereum actually rewards miners who produce orphaned blocks but I don't know whether DAA takes orphans into account.

In fact keeping orphans around help the community monitor and study Bitcoin mining network. It is healthy and valuable by itself. Now it can also defeat SM permanently. One stone, two birds. Why not?

"Actually, the point of holding the token is for passive income through token burn when/if adoption picks up. You don't have to hold REQ to use the platform, as REQ is purchased (at market value) in the background when you use a dApp that is built on the platform. I feel like their PWC partnership has much more substance than many other crypto partnerships. Request team was working with PWC for 6 months before a partnership was announced, and the partner is in the same sector. You say many teams have a working product, which is actually not true. More teams do not have a working product compared to the ones that do have one. True, adoption is very low right now, but they are working towards the components to pick up steam in that department. WooREQ plugin for WooCommerce should be completed soon, and a Shopify plugin is also in the works. The biggest advantage is going to be the simplicity for normal people that aren't into the crypto world. Pay in FIAT, which gets converted to whatever the seller wants to be paid in, whether that be crypto or fiat. We are probably a long way from this, but that's the plan. In the meantime it will help with cross-crypto payments instead of having a million different crypto payment options. REQ will allow many of them to be consolidated into one once their ERC20 support is completed. Just a thought.

4. He faked [threats](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/80o2xf/its_time_for_another_reminder_craig_wright_is_not/duxbjuw/) 
5. He faked [a public key signing](http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/05/craig-wright-s-proof-he-invented-bitcoin-is-basically-a-canadian-girlfriend.html)
6. He has a [well-documented history of fabricating things bitcoin and non-bitcoin related](https://www.scribd.com/document/372445546/Bitcoin-Lawsuit) (see numbers 88 through 102)
7. His own mother [admits he has a longstanding habit of fabricating things](http://archive.is/kjuLi#selection-1655.0-1655.94)

And specifically concerning his claim to be Satoshi:

1. He has provided no independently verifiable evidence
2. He is not [technically competent](http://archive.is/6C3C9) in the subject matter
3. His [writing style](http://seclists.org/basics/2008/Mar/42) is nothing like [Satoshi's](http://satoshinakamoto.me/)
4. He [called bitcoin ""Bit Coin"" in 2011](https://theconversation.com/lulzsec-anonymous-freedom-fighters-or-the-new-face-of-evil-2605#comment_6162) when Satoshi never used a space
5. He [actively bought and traded coins](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4hx3q9/according_to_the_mtgox_leaks_from_early_2014_our/) from Mt. Gox in 2013 and 2014
6. He was [paid millions](http://archive.is/kjuLi#selection-729.989-732.0) for 'coming out' as Satoshi as part of the deal to sell his patents to nTrust - for those who claim he was 'outed' or had no motive",1523705364

"&gt; Untrue. Dash for instance, which is one of the least expensive is more expensive to use than BC. So is ETH. So is Monero. So is BTC. So are most of the major alt coins.

SO the other 500 that no one uses are mostly cheaper. And there is an inexhaustible amount of shitcoins that can be created that are gonna be free to transfer. Some are free now. WHy is no one using those?

&gt; For 99%+ of practical purposes, 0 conf does not compromise security. Yes, I would sell a house or a bag of groceries with 0 conf. If you don't understand why I would say that, you probably haven't heard the arguments.

OK. Still insta send is all around.

&gt; You're looking at prices at current rates of transactions. As transactions increase, this difference becomes meaningful. Back in December, Dash cost $0.15 to use while BCH cost order of magnitude less than $0.01 to use. Paying a $0.15 tax every time you buy a $5 sandwich is considerable. And that difference only increases as usage goes up.

You assume BCH is the only scalable coin? What stops any coin from scaling like BCH did? Now it's the fact that no one wants that but from a technical point? So far last pump I haven't seen an exodus of people from expensive coins to cheaper ones, but of course no one is buying coffee. IMO that is not a meaningful use case at this point anyway.

&gt; More people buy overpriced stocks to try and increase their purchasing power than buy underpriced stocks. That doesn't mean that overpriced stocks are more ""usable"" for increasing your purchasing power. They are not. They are demonstrably less useful for that purpose, but people currently do it anyway.

No idea what you are saying. Since we agree all transactions that pay the fee are valid, a blockchain with more on chain transactions is more useful/used/usable/etc than one with fewer. So DOge&gt;BCH, although it is a work in progress, I just don't see how BCH can win the medium of exchange battle. Both because a)other alts are superior and b)the coin that people use to store value has a huge advantage.",1523705183

Bitcoin Cash hard forked off in August 2017, the chain had a difficulty algo that cause massive swings in hash rate, so it was abandoned (mostly, but now lives on in the form of Bitcoin Clashic and is in fact still mineable thanks to the EDA), the Bitcoin Cash fork kept the name as 99.9% of people preferred that (and no miners were willing to put serious hash power to contest the fork).

Another fork is due for Bitcoin Cash, which _may_ leave a legacy chain (but probably not) again.

May support the mentality of the ""We're forking and we're taking the name with us"" mentality, which I guess was learned from Ethereum.

Again not true, unless you are simply not defining the scope of the discussion. On an arbitrary ASIC-resistant crypto, you would not need 100's of millions of computers, many have been manipulated by bot armies already.  

If you're talking about a non-ASIC-resistant crypto, you're making my point for me. If you're talking about a crypto that was originally ASIC-resistant, but is in the process of failing such resistance, then you're in the grey area where one case transitions into the other.",1523704825

This kind of back-dating fraud is like how CSW went back and altered an old 2008 blog post, to make it seem like he was working on cryptocurrency in 2008, to bolster his fraudulent Satoshi claim in 2016.

I'm supportive of 99% of the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem.  All my posts on yours.org, youtube, reddit, twitter, are pro-BCH.

**But CSW's Fake Satoshi brand is poison.**

If ""Fake Satoshi"" is promoted as the public face of BCH, it would be a **fatal marketing &amp; branding mistake**, as the crypto world would never embrace ""Fake Satoshi's BCH"" as the #1 everyday cryptocurrency. 

The disastrous ""Fake Satoshi"" brand is the **NUMBER ONE THREAT** to Bitcoin Cash's future.  It would wipe out all of BCH's tech &amp; adoption gains (bigger blocks, Bitpay integrations, CoinText.io projects, etc).

If CSW really cares about BCH, he should get off the stage, and publish whitepapers under a pseudonym (like how Real Satoshi did), or under the nTrust / nChain name.  

Promoting CSW &amp; BCH together is suicide for BCH.

I urge the BCH community to wake up before it's too late.

btw, I also recommend watching Rick Falkvinge's recent video:

https://youtube.com/watch?v=nOLZNtbLUTY",1523703922
"Start of by reading the white paper (bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf). At least read the first page (there's only a total of 8 though). After considering this you will understand that you should look into Bitcoin (BCH) as that is the version of Bitcoin that is still useful as money and the project with a roadmap that is in line with the original vision of Bitcoin as a ""p2p electronic cash system"". 

Bitcoin (BTC) is a slower, more expensive and deprecated version with a centralized management (Blockstream + Core dev team) and a censored, authoritarian community. Moreover, the BTC community erroneously thinks the coin is a ""store of value"" despite lacking any and all utility as a cryptoCURRENCY.

Get your smelly meats and bitcoin,1523703775
"&gt;Thanks to you I took a closer look at the paper and actually, section 6 (the ""Problem Statement"") falls completely apart in the absence of non mining nodes, it actually states that without these, the SM is at a disadvantage

You're completely misreading the statement. I believe what you're referring to is the following:

&gt;The Bitcoin protocol prescribes that when a miner knows of multiple branches of the same length, it mines and propagates only the first branch it received. Recall that a pool that runs the Selfish-Mine strategy and has a lead of 1 publishes its secret block P once it hears of a competing block X found by a non-pool block. If block P reaches a non-pool miner before block X, that miner will mine on P.

&gt;Because selfish mining is reactive, and it springs into action only after the
honest nodes have discovered a block X, it may **seem to be at a disadvantage.**

You're reading this to mean without Sybils SM ""falls apart completely."" What it's actually discussing is gamma and how it may seem like it will be low because SM is at a disadvantage in the race, but SM can increase gamma using this Sybil strategy that you and I both agree probably won't work. Like I just said, this is unimportant. You don't need to be able to increase gamma to be able to selfish mine profitably.

&gt;Section 7 (the recommendation) becomes spurious in the absence of a credible Problem Statement.

You mean section 6.2, but I mostly agree with this point, in so far as the near-completeness of the Bitcoin network actually does harden Bitcoin against attack like this and make gamma naturally low.

&gt;This leaves sections 1-5 and no problem.

last night i was having beers with a guy who lives in vietnam primarily.  he mentioned that one of the larger real organic uses in the country was to escape currency controls, and many filipinos working abroad in vietnam would send remittances home got into crypto to avoid the controls and fees of traditional money transfer agents.  they used bitcoin for a while, but the high fees drove them out, and they now use bitcoin cash.

it's simply an anecdote - but i certainly find this much more meaningful than whatever complexity you needed to go through so that you can buy tacos from the one store that will sell you some in the heart of the most technologically experimental places on the planet.

&gt; It is the community that decides, and they don't seem convinced (and an alternative option now exists for those that do).

based on what though?  only time will tell.  i don't consider the sheer value or 'market cap' (a concept that doesn't sound right for a currency to start) an indicator of this, but it is something i hear often.  i would not find the price claim very valid normally, but in an environment filled with FOMO and people who claim bitcoin is store of value digital gold - who don't actually seem to understand how gold, or money, or any store of value have ever worked - price at a point in time matters even less.  i literally cannot even come and post in here without multiple people claiming things like i'm a shill for daring to even talk about how some things are valued or work.  wtf?  

what i'd actually find meaningful is something i don't think we have any real metrics around, which is how many real organic use cases are being leveraged for any given crypto.  remittances, merchant transactions, black or white market, etc etc.  in the least your one taco guy, does he take BTC or other coins too?  how many tacos has he sold in any of them, and over time?  he's a silicon valley taco guy i expect a full taco dashboard analysis.

"Understood, and I absolutely agree that better PR would be, well, better.

But I think for various reasons BCH, such as heritage, lack of a single leader (despite CSW's attempts to become that), most importantly the most massive mining system backing it, POW being better than POS and being the *obvious alternative* to BTC when the fees will rise again means it still has an absolutely *excellent* shot at becoming crypto #1.

I think another reason why there's controversy is actually the current price ratio, which is admittedly far from stellar. Makes people itchy, unruly and negative. So I feel a bit like a contrarian now saying that I actually am quite bullish on BCH.

I took part of the discussion here because, well, as you say, I have met and trust Peter and coming from a somewhat similar background, understand where he's coming from, why he's calling BS BS and so forth. And I think it takes guts to go, as an individual, against a well-funded company, and the least I can do is to use my pseudonymous identity to voice my support.

**Bitcoin vs other cryptos**: the crypto space as a whole is becoming bigger than Bitcoin in the terms of the aggregate value. But Bitcoin remains to be the #1 crypto.  

**Bitcoin vs national currencies**: Bitcoin is now one of the biggest currencies worldwide, both by the aggregate value and the number of users. It's still tiny in in the terms of the volume and dominance, but both metrics show significant growth. 

**Politics**: the world is becoming more divided on what to do with Bitcoin: both the number of haters and fans are growing among governments. There is a growing number of influential political parties who support Bitcoin. 

**Tech**: thanks to the massive upgrades of the past year,  transactions are now both cheaper and faster than before, while providing some new features like atomic swaps. ",1523701181

"The reason why it is fast is because they have a 30 second blocktime while bitcoin has a 10 minute and lightcoin has a 2.5 minute blocktime.  
This fast blocktime sounds good but there are reasons why bitcoin has a 10 minute blocktime. 
https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/1863/why-was-the-target-block-time-chosen-to-be-10-minutes?utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_source=google_rich_qa&amp;utm_campaign=google_rich_qa  
Also all nodes need to sync with the latest data and it will become difficult for all nodes to sync within 30 second as the network gets larger. Monero changed from 1 minute to 2 minutes and they still think they will need to increase it if they grow even more.   

If you know a developer who you could trust I would recommend you having he or she take a look at their github repo and review their development process. It would be best to have a blockchain developer review the code but I think any developer will be able to notice if they are skilled or not.  

Anybody could fork bitcoin and change the blocktime to 5 seconds and run it on centralized nodes and create a super fast fee-less currency, however you could imagine that will not work in the real world.

It's not that simple. Most people here are buying cryptocurrencies with the expectation that it's fiat exchange value will increase so they can sell and make a profit. That is an investment (look at the definition) and because the purchase is not a simple wager but rather the ownership of value on the blockchain it is a digital asset. If you are buying cryptocurrencies not to make money but perhaps to buy things with it then it's primarily a currency for you. I don't think a lot of people actually use it as a currency because no one wants to be that guy who bought a pizza for an obscene amount of Bitcoin only for it to be worth millions later. It's role as a currency will take stage when the liquidity has got big enough for the price to not swing wildly.

"I agree with this wholeheartedly.

Here's the thing: it is possible both that Peter Rizun, Emin Gun Sirer, and Thomas Zander are smarter than CSW and that they nonetheless hurt BCH by turning him into the focal point of a rift in the community. It is also possible Craig is a fraud and doesn't know what he's talking about with respect to crypto yet creates a net benefit by donating tons of money and time to promoting it.

As I've said before, I lack the technical expertise to judge the relative knowledge of e.g. Emin and Peter versus Craig, though certainly the former have more polish.

And I think this may be where a lot of the trouble comes in. Craig may have spent a million years in various degree programs, but he's fundamentally not an academic. He doesn't adhere to their standards of care and rigor before saying things and he doesn't really speak their language.

As an academic myself (humanities, but not, I don't think, entirely irrelevant experience), I know that a big part of the training process is consciously and subconsciously learning not just how to research and write about problems, but how to present your research and writing and self in a manner acceptable to other academics. It is entirely possible to have a research paper that is fundamentally correct and insightful rejected because it did not adhere to typical academic style, was sloppy in its citation practice, did not give nods to all those it should have, etc. etc.

Craig, whether his ideas are good or not, is not acculturated in this world and does not speak the language of Cornell professors. This makes him seem like not a Serious Person to Cornell professors. Cornell professors want to be seen working on Serious projects with Serious People, not amateur hour with cranks and conmen.

This, I am guessing, makes it seem very urgent to people like Emin and Peter that they eject someone like Craig from any prominent position he may occupy in anything they are working on, even though their attempt to do so may ultimately be more harmful to the project than not.",1523698979

Understood.  But I sincerely don't want you to lose respect for them.  I think their intelligence and contribution is also part of their humanity.

As disgusting as the censorship and propaganda spread by the BTC core team.

I couldn't agree more.  I thought it was a very ugly moment when Vitalik stood up and called out Craig at Deconomy.  Even if you don't like Craig, what a terrible thing to focus on.  I felt Vitalik was co-opting the entire conference that moment in effort to reestablish his hierarchy.  I demoted Vitalik right then and there.  Not to make this about Vitalik.  I feel the same way about everyone who is doing it.  I very sincerely want to thank ROGER VER for his leadership and consistency. 

&gt;  It almost makes me doubt whether a truly decentralized governance is possible in the long term, because humans have tendency to pick sides and hurt one another regardless of how many small groups they split into.

I prefer the term self governance over decentralized governance.  I do think it's possible.

Its so very easy for issues to become politicized.  And we will commit all sorts of internal logic flip-flops to maintain our group identity. 

Its really interesting material.  And I think its worth acknowleding that supporters of crypto have alot in common, but we argue incessently over realtively minor differences - in what is a open source decentralized software. There are two chains now. Live and let live. I personally don't see it as a zero sum game. ",1523697084
"wait, i wasn't talking about market cap. Like someone mentioned before i was wrong about the $450 mil number. If mining reward halves twice it means miners will get 450 btc daily. I'm not even counting rewards for transactions that miners also get. 450 btc x $250000(price per btc) = ~$110 mil.  To give a rough estimate, miners on average will cash out $110 mil daily. Let's pretend that no one else in the market is selling but miners, people would need to buy $110 mil worth of btc daily to sustain $250000 price per btc. To me that sounds impossible.",1523697012
"First off, just read A LOT about everything. From what blockchain tech is, what cryptocurrencies are, which cryptocurrencies there are (look up all coins in top 30), look up all the negative news too, about exchanges, about hacks and scams. Make sure you are well informed. 

Second, buy a PC man. You can buy a second hand PC with a quad core CPU (amd Athlon / phenom II range of the am3 platform are cheap nowadays, else Core2Quad, make sure you have at least 4gb ram, the rest doesn't really matter, I've bought fully functional PC's for 50 euros so it should be affordable for you - buy a second hand workstation with one of the above configuration). 

Third, read up how you can safely store crypto. Read up about wallets, nodes, paper wallets, ledger etc. Coins get stolen all the time, make sure it won't be happening to you! DONT use web wallets, or at least don't use them online. Some are trustworthy, but never assume because one is trustworthy, all are. 

Fourh, you missed the boat for now IMO. When btc was in the 6k range, it was a great buy, as was eth/neo and many other alt coins. If you do want to invest, research the shit out of it, so you build confidence in your investment and you won't be scared out if it does drop in value for a while. I'd say look in IOTA, NEO, ETH, XLM, ADA, XRP and VEN as strong alt coins. Don't just invest though, read up and feel if it connects with you, rationalize how it could impact the (financial or supply world).

Next big thing is , how you will be paying for btc . If bank transfer then you screwed big time. Banks will ask reason behind opening account.

Most likely category which describes misuse of bank account. Once you ok CIFAS you virtually done in UK . None of the banks will do any business with you(under your name) , none of the services using credit score and CIFAS.org will do any business with you. 

UK is fucked up country to do any business with crypto. That's why some company's have dormant business done in UK but banking accounts in Europe . Also banks eventually will fill SAR against your account which means you will be checked by NCA and maybe other gov bodies.

"Indeed, I just 5 minutes ago wrote something similar in another thread :

I wouldn't necessarily say better, but at least it's a solid coin :

---&gt; subjective, but I find the branding and naming cool. Don't underestimate this aspect; why you pay 50% more for an Apple, mainly branding. And positive or negative, the name is out there. Most in crypto heard of Verge and the bumps in the road, but still, brand awarenes is pretty high

---&gt; Really fast; don't know that much about specific technicalities but when transferring from exchange to wallet it was hella fast

---&gt; Big supply, good for mainstream adoption, no 10k units which deter regular folks buying them

---&gt; No pre-mine

---&gt; Optional privacy. Yeah I know about all the technical debates and stuff and for sure it can get improved (Ring signatures coming I understood), but still; even in it's current state it does offer something others don't. Yeah, every coin could use Tor, but adoption is also about ease of use and Wraith provides that with the click of a button. And again, Wraith, pretty cool branding.

These are some that pop to mind. So it's not revolutionary or anything, just a pretty solid alt. Nothing close to the Carmageddon and Hitler-level disaster many make it out to be. Not sure why they do; it's almost like some mass psychosis, or herd mentality, like everyone picking on one guy during school lunch break. Really pathetic. If you don't like a coin fine, but the level of hate against Verge is not rational anymore.",1523696133

But since it's obvious the government will tax any income they can, the proposal to tax income from crypto as capital gains, seems logical at least from the first glance.

The difference from other assets capital gains would apply to, like stocks and bonds, is that cryptos are frictionless to transfer, in contrast to the former. Depending on the details, this could be an accounting nightmare - if you would have to journal every transaction you make with cryptos along with the price.

It seems more likely though that one would have to log the transaction when converting to/from fiat (in an exchange), which is more fair, as long as a sale at loss also reduces your outstanding amount taxed. ",1523694437

While I did say ""The Crypto Fairytale"" it doesn't mean I don't agree that there is true good which this phenomena aims to bring. 

Again though, those are separate from my initial point and what has always existed as my point. Which is the sharks know how to manipulate. Advertising is essentially THAT.

I think that's his argument. Sure.

No. Of course I can agree on certain things with someone who is untrustworthy. 

Although I don't fully agree what Bitcoin in its current form is sustainable. I was a big blocker because it can at least scale a LOT bigger than 1.7kBps. But there really are limitations at some point, but if Bitcoin (Cash) doesn't grow too fast, all that could be perfectly fine. Might never hit a scaling limit.

"&gt; The perfect solution is in DA

&gt; One simple protocol tuning that almost has zero impact on honest miners is to change how difficulty adjustment algorithm (DAA) works. Instead of adjusting mining difficulty according to average effective block rate in the past, we can adjust the difficulty based on average total block rate including orphaned blocks. In normal times without Selfish Mining, this new DA will be essentially the same as  the old one because orphans are very rare. In case of Selfish Mining, the new DAA completely thwarts SM's prospect of recouping the loss and profiting through DA. With this new DAA, only suicidal miners will do Selfish Mining because there is no chance to gain any benefit in doing so now and in the future. We can just let the mostly honest mining community handle these suicidal miners.

&gt; With this simple DAA tuning,  we can leave behind Selfish Mining and move on to make bitcoin cash great forever by focusing on adoption. ",1523694019

"Do not invest anymore than you can loose this is the golden rule, I'll explain, the second you see your investment doubled you will not cash out, because of the greed of doubling again, the probability of this happening in a Short term (5 months apparently) is pretty low, and since the growth (like the one we had this week) is so crazy it  brings new people like you it will correct (it seems we are still correcting from December, which is when I got in, the temperature feels like we are up for another crazy increase) when it corrects you are going down probably more than 70% of your overall investment  and most people crack down and sell at a loss, when the next price increase comes you'll want to try again and so on...

Now what you must do is, read my friend, read everything you can about each token, know what the white paper says (technical and philosophical point of view star with btc's) probably buy some btc and watch how the market behaves, learn the team that is behind and then ask yourself thinking about on how the email was first said it wouldn't be helpful and nowadays we still discover usage  cases for it which still generate income to stablished parties. Then and just after all this research is done watch the volumes on each token, watch the prices, would you as a potential consumer pay that price for that token to be used on what ever it does? Would you pay more? Buy said tokens, get them out of the exchange and go live your life occasionally checking the price if you like, download an app and set alarms when the price is near your profit exit point or before it hits your entry point to stop losses. 


Or you could go the trading route but you will  find out soon enough that on the short term the market is crazy and it goes up and down so day trading is a full time job and you can get wrecked (this week whoever sold before it shoot up are holding Fiat or some alt coin let's say they watched the volume on trx and decided to gamble because they read somewhere it would shoot up like crazy, and suddenly after they sell their btc, it leaves behind the price point where they left and it could be months without touching lower, or never or tomorrow just after they bought in a little higher than before producing never ending constant loses which will dry them out...


So yeah, spread your investment, hold, think, research and enjoy the ride, you will be telling this story to tour grandkids or grand nephews or... To some one over the Webcam on chat roulette when you are all alone and sad when you're 90

This is not investment advice what so ever, but I'm holding btc eth Ada xrp and thinking about getting iota stellar monero and ltc... I'm currently way down of what I initially invested so you know that even when you are reading and constantly updated you can and will fuck up so... 

Never invest more than you can afford to loose, this means, a commitment to yourself that if you claim that instead of going out to drink tonight you are going to add 50 bucks to your portfolio then you will not party out the next day with the same 50 bucks and double spend money you don't have... 


Happy ride =3

"Trust me man if you're struggling with a lack of money, buy a computer and put money into savings before gambling on a new speculative asset class. Most people lose money ""investing"" in cryptocurrency. There are plenty of opportunities to make money but even more opportunities to get scammed in this space, it's like the Wild West. If you really want to invest though, use GDAX (backend exchange for coinbase). Given your situation I doubt you want to lose any of your investment in obnoxious fees. Deposit fiat to coinbase wallet then instantly transfer it to GDAX and place a buy order for BTC or ETH or LTC. Using GDAX allows you to mitigate buying fees and transfer fees at the cost of having to wait for your money to be sent to coinbase initially. From there you can store your coins relatively safely on coinbase, send them to a private wallet, or trade on an exchange like Binance.",1523693289

Bitcoin will even the playing field because it will also reeuce the power of the state, where despite what everyone tells you, the state mostly benefit the rich.

So bitcoin will even the playing field, and although some early adopters will probably be disproportionately wealthy, there will only be very few of them, and lets face it, they wont have any skills. all they have is a pile of money. They will either waste it or take it to their grave.

This comment only shows your ignorance about the concept of identity and public key cryptography. You are free to say whatever with ""100%"" certainty but that doesn't make it 100% certain. It just makes you a fool who has a blind belief in something that's not true.

There is absolutely NO way to prove that someone doesn't own a key, just based on his failure to sign. This is actually one of the fundamental principles of how Bitcoin works.

Also there is no such thing as 90% plagiarized paper. If the point he's making is novel, then it's not plagiarized. And he DID make a novel point (although whether it's correct or not is up for discussion, which IS NOT happening because you can just conveniently label it ""plagiarism"")",1523692642
"Your claim about TA is mostly false and only applies to certain conditions. I was studying forex trading, (but have shifted to crypto because i get to be part of it from the beginning, get better fundamental news and historical knowledge compared to forex) and if you want to talk how TA analysis is hard then go to EURUSD and make the same claims there. Yes there are big players and the market can do the same price action Bitcoin does (big candle out of nowhere on timeframes less than the daily, huge run-up on the weekly), but people **are** making money of that market. 

&gt; Guys be careful with any kind of TA on Bitcoin. I'll be the first to tell you TA works on Bitcoin, but all that matters over the last month and a half is what the big money wants to do and what they are doing with the short-sell orders. Imagine TA being like studying the race-course before a giant car race. You painstakingly study each turn, each bend, each obstacle in the race and if that was the course you would do well. But if you guys see all these massive 1-2 candle spikes or dips for $500-1000 you know that this isn't the race-course you studied. Every few hours someone comes in and drops a hurricane on the course and wipes it clean. You don't have any idea which way things are going.

I want to say that you sound like a newbie, because from what you are saying it seems that crypto was your first introduction to the market. **This is what happenes to every market**

Every market, regardless if it is unregulated or regulated the story is the exact same. The only thing that requires a price to jump or for a certain pattern to be broken is **one** person/institution. And these aren‚Äôt my words, you can go to ‚ÄúTradeempowered‚Äù and you will hear the same words, even we are talking about a *regulated Forex market*. 

Yes your analogy of the racecar is correct, but that is why teachers don‚Äôt recommend trading on lower timeframes because they are less predictable. There is*market noise* which gets more influencial the lower the timeframe you go.

&gt;ANYONE giving you TA on Bitcoin right now clearly does not understand what has been moving Bitcoin for the last 6 weeks. Do not trust it. Any guess is 50/50 at best. There's someone sitting on the sidelines right now with at least $100 million that can drop it whichever way they please, they can short or they can go long. Again, ANYONE telling you they can predict Bitcoin right now will only lose you money if you trust them - that includes me. If you think I'm lying go look at the chart for Bitcoin and you tell me if this is natural movement:
""flat flat flat flat flat +500 flat flat flat flat -300 flat flat +1000 flat flat flat""

It‚Äôs not 50/50. And it does not matter if it is 30/70 (you only are right 30% of the time), because you don‚Äôt take into account **risk reward**. The example:

* Trades that lose 70% of the time, lose 10$ on every losing trade.
* Trades that win 30% of the time, win 100$ on every winning trade.

In probability you will lose more traders than you win, but you will be making money regardless. Losing the first 6 trades will give you - 60$, but after winning one you will be +40$ in profit.

The big problem is people trust TA on sources which have no historical background or they themselves have no experience trading.

**Trading isn‚Äôt black and white. **

[Let‚Äôs look at Bitcoin at the 1 hour. Pretty spiky and hard to predict. Sharp candles, hard to trade, big manipulation.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/CjnIzw4Z/)

[Let‚Äôs look at Bitcoin at the daily.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/nyZ9aIHk/) 

These kind of price movements on lower timeframes will screw you over, but on higher timeframes it just is a little bounce that i personally anticipated, because of support zones. Will it go upwards from here? I don‚Äôt know, but i could have traded that and made money.

Now does this only happen in crypto?

[GBPUSD 2016 June Brexit. Timeframe 4 hour](https://www.tradingview.com/x/nyZ9aIHk/)

[GBPUSD 2016 June Brexit. Timeframe Daily](https://www.tradingview.com/x/HCA2Y0GO/)

[GBPUSD 2016 June Brexit. Timeframe Weekly](https://www.tradingview.com/x/zUXIxFx9/)

If you were in this long you would be screwed over if you had no stoploss (the stoploss woulnd‚Äôt even be guaranteed). Doesn‚Äôt matter if it is Bitcoin or if it is any other market, big money can screw you over.

That doesn‚Äôt mean you couldn‚Äôt make money shorting this. Look at the GBPUSD Weekly, (third pic). The price went up to 1.5000 (psychological number), look left there is support, then went down. Big players probably knew about Brexit a lot sooner compared to the public, but if you follow the big players, you can make money.

The bigger the timeframe, the less you give a damn about *market noise*. If you trade Bitcoin on the 1 hour, then you have to deal with these kinds of spikes. Trade Bitcoin on the Daily and you care less about spikes.

**The market has taken EVERYTHING into consideration**

All the manipulation all the TA that people do, all the regulation, everything is already part of the market, because the market is run a lot by human emotions and during the past few hundred years i am pretty sure out emotions haven‚Äôt evolved much.

If you say TA doesn‚Äôt work then you are dising all the traders that make money consistently of it. The reason why people say TA doesn‚Äôt work is because 95%, the majority say it doesn‚Äôt. Meaning the 5% minority won‚Äôt be heard.

Go ask Richard Heart or any other youtuber and they will probably tell you TA does work, but you need well managed emotions, experience, knowledge and discipline to be part of the 5%.

You are the only one here so obsessed with comparing different coins and shitting all over the ones you don't seem worthy of your attention. Nobody here asked for your opinion. Nobody here cares about your opinion. Nobody here will never even know who you are other than ""that elitist asshole who came to this subreddit to shit all over himself and cry like a baby"".

So. You can spot deficiencies in Bitcoin? Awesome! What are you doing to help? Nothing? That's what I thought.

So unless you have any real critiques or possible solutions, your opinion doesn't mean anything and just comes across as narcissistic and pathetic.",1523690318
"that depends if you believe the 20 million BTC which are actually tradeable and not lost/locked should only represent a 20 billion value, given that the world population is 8 billion and q guy like Bill Gates on his lonesome is worth 90 billion.",1523690268
"Dont be daft. No one ever said btc and bch are the same. they are both versions of the bitcoin open source software. bch is the version of bitcoin that is useful as money, btc is slow, expensive and less reliable. bch is more inline with bitcoin than btc which has been degraded by inept leaders censorship, and a sheepish, collectivist community",1523690254
I mean come on. I know now its cool to hate on Vechain but you cant deny the fact that the team is delivering like crazy. Solid crypto and very comfy hold,1523690157

"Depends, traders do that but alot of investors want a healthy market with organic growth. I stay away from the scams even if I think that I can make a quick buck. This is because I believe that the money will be better in the long run if we purge all the scams and hold good coins. 

I want crypto to succeed in the long run, not just be a get rich quick scheme that people will eventually leave because they lost too much money to a few scammers, who will later also leave the market because they are rich enough to not have to work/scam anymore.",1523690133
"Great write up.  What about the current % fee to even purchase crypto? Why would I buy BTC and be charged a fee to use it to buy something else? It makes no sense.

"&gt;When your internet funbux are so weak that the best you can say about them is ""other things are just as bad.""

That's an actual comment from /r/Buttcoin, upvoted and everything, when someone mentioned that USD also has issues with theft and hacking.

What I thought was funny is that it implies bitcoin is of the same value as USD. Which is ridiculous. Bitcoin is much more valuable and versatile than USD. I can much more with a paper wallet with $100 worth of bitcoin than what I can do with a $100 bill. ",1523690057
"If half of the community wants to do what nchain says

And half of the community doesn't want to be patent trolling

How does bitcoin cash decide things like this with no leader?

Without a leader or someone making the decisions, how do you decide if you align yourselves with people like Craig when the community is effectively split?",1523690045
It is harder to track cash transactions. I bet that crypto will help actually to track terrorists down better than any fiat would.,1523689994

Those advices here give me cancer. Stay out until Bitcoin goes sideways for a couple of month. We will see lower drops to 6.000. After that support breaks it will finally go down to the last state. I don't know where the bottom will be but the current state is not the bottom lol. You will.hate yourself for fomoing in. Thank me later.,1523689920
"The problem is that people in this sub can't accept any criticism of CSW (seriously, your post is textbook cognitive dissonance) because they somehow take it as an attack on Bitcoin Cash.

CSW is a liar, this has been demonstrated many many times already, including when he fabricated evidence that he was Satoshi.

&gt; What we need is a decentralized community with no single dominant player

That's exactly right, stop tying CSW to Bitcoin Cash or you'll have to keep defending him senselessly like in the present post.",1523689814
"&gt; Compare this to other people, say, Jonald fyookbal. He is the ideal contributor in the sense that he is very discreet and mostly open threads to announce actual products released. 

You inadvertently raise an excellent point. I was surprised as hell to see jonald_fyookball post [his ‚Äúrant‚Äù](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89mcjd/my_csw_rant/) where he ended up regurgitating many of the false talking points that Craig‚Äôs obvious sock-puppets use on a daily basis (Maybe he deliberately created a bunch of fake evidence to throw people off his scent. If you don‚Äôt believe him just ignore him. You‚Äôre either with us or against us). 

Having seen Peter_R‚Äôs recent claims that nChain privately contacted him every time he challenged or criticised Craig, and ultimately withdrew their funding for a project Peter was involved in. It‚Äôs natural to question how many of the real, respectable developers working in this space have this kind of conflict of interest going on. ",1523689803
"It is my moral duty to inform the BCH community about fraud &amp; poison.

"&gt; Bitcoin is obsolete technology.

I see your point but I don't think it's useful to your agenda.

Imagine it's the early days of the Internet, and someone invents 56k dialup internet access, then someone else invents 4G LTE. Most people still don't have Internet access. Sure LTE is the superior technology, but you know what? If I happen to live in a place where there are no cell towers, I am damn sure gonna use 56k because the Internet is still a massive win even at restricted speeds.

That is the real point, metaphorically speaking. Internet.

People need to understand the value of being connected to the Internet.

Anyway, I generally agree with your sentiment. People need to be able to connect to the Internet easily.

"Why does the American media always miss the main source of a problem? It is clearly your pharma industry that is responsible for the crisis. Forgetting abuse and recreational use, the opioid prescriptions alone in America make up 80&amp;#37; of the world's total opioid prescriptions. Reminds me of A scanner darkly type situation.

Meanwhile the politicians are still targeting immigrants while giving the giant pharmas tax breaks. Way to go. And the establishment will obviously target bitcoin, and other decentralized currencies because they feel threatened by them. We live in an important juncture where power can become absolute, and power will brainwash even the most liberal of democracies, we need to take a stand and prevent that dystopia from becoming real. The only way to protect individual thought and transparency is by giving ordinary people real power, not just votes that can easily be influenced via data analytics. Fight the pharmas and government that has allowed lax prescription laws.

"Nah, I think it's more like if you'd like to invest into a asset similar to gold in Crypto you choose Bitcoin. If you're looking for a transactional crypto, then you can choose from the other few available. Bitcoin would do well for very large transactions (just like how you can just transfer gold instead of USD/CAD/EURO/etc.. for the transaction if the buying party agrees). 

You don't really think in real life when should I spend my gold over fiat, and I think the same will be with Crypto.",1523689355
"But it is one of the most valid points being raised in a long time. 

Using crypto really is a hassle at the moment. There are fast transaction times, woop-dee-doo, but do you really think that makes up for the user friendliness?

You hardly find decent fiat to crypto exchanges, choices are limited an scattered across lots of exchanges, exchanges work with clumsy UI's rather than one click trades, working with and securing a private key is a hassle and there is too much pf a risk of you losing your crypto if not secured properly, I have to spend hours looking for a decent wallet and then I still hardly have he possibility to store multiple different coins in one wallet ...
