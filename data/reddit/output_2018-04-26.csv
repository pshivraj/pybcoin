"I strongly dislike Ver and co but I just wonder where these poor fuckers are that wanted BTC and know its $9000+  Went to bitcoin.com and bought BCH at $1300....

I am SURE there are a few but I honestly wonder are there enough to matter..?

Does ANYONE jsut go and type in .com after the thing they are looking for anymore?  pets.com?  No, I use google...",1524812325
"Have an up vote, although I am still on the other side. I don't deny BCH is a better coin and probably more inline with Satoshi's vision, but the same can be said of many other forks. BTC won't be top dog forever, and when that happens we can call one of the other forks ""the"" bitcoin. It could be BCH, or it could be an ASIC resistant one like BTCP or BTCZ. BCH isn't exactly decentralised when Antminer's ASICs mine most of the supply and their pool is manipulating the price.",1524812302

So your saying when BCH gains majority Hash Power it'll be bitcoin.  But beforehand its it isn't.  Hmmm.. ok  Lets have this conversation in a few more weeks.,1524812207
"Bitcoin _was_ the reason. Aside from being the most battle tested and recognized name (which are both fairly significant) there a better tech for almost any possible use case now. Financially it still underpins the market, but I think it's becoming increasingly unclear what role it should have (hence the core of some of the issues that caused the BCH split)",1524812201

"#4 doesn't matter. Once it's above Bitcoin they can call BCash whatever they want, but it's not likely to happen. Once public opinion turns against Bitcoin for being slow and old it's not going to be replaced by yet another Bitcoun, but by an altcoin.",1524812115
Satoshi supported no block limit and only added it as spam protection when Bitcoin was worth pretty much nothing. The whole idea was to raise block sizes as soon as you come even close to filling blocks.,1524812106
"The whole name thing was a technicality that I blissfully ignored in the whimsical grandeur of my dream of a noble implementation of Bitcoin.  I get *why* it's called Bitcoin Cash.  I can fully appreciate when you say why holding onto the name of Bitcoin brings security and a sense of legitimacy.  It makes sense that potential new users would find trust in the most well know name of crypto.   

Do you not think it is unfair to immediately discredit what you call an ""altcoin"" because it doesn't have Bitcoin in the name?  Is it required if you fork from Bitcoin to use it's name?  I simply think that as long as the foundation is the whitepaper and is forked from the original blockchain, the worthiness will be in the product itself and not the name.  

If exposure is your main concern, I would say that the truth always reveals itself, and with code there is no ambiguity.  If it is bitcoin but better, it doesn't need to be called Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is just the name of Satoshi's idea, it is not bound to the code.  It's function is not to be called Bitcoin, it is to disrupt the monetary constraints that prevent the people of all nations from being in control of their personal financial destiny.  It is to free us from the fraud and thievery that dominates our companies and leadership, no matter what government or CEO rules.  I don't mean to chastise you but do you not understand the implications of this?  This is our future.  We finally have a way to beat the masters.",1524812103
"I'm genuinely curious, why do you even spend time on this subreddit, you obviously don't like anyone here or any of the content (i.e. any variants of the original bitcoin.)  So why?",1524812026
"I was being glib, but I do think there are things that would disqualify entities from claiming to be Bitcoin, even if they're not strictly dictated in the white paper. For myself, issuing from the original Genesis block would be one. Personally, changing SHA256 proof-of-work would be another.",1524812019
"&gt; No, you've got people intentionally misleading others by calling Bitcoin Cash ""Bitcoin""

Saying that Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin is a marketing plot, but also makes sense from a technology point of view. Is it too much to ask today that people do a five minute Google search about what they invest in? Nobody gets confused by the fact that there is Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola and a multitude of other Colas.

"&gt; The marketplace deems BCH as a worthy investment.

The argument many hold is that some part of the marketplace deems Bitcoin worthy of buying, but got tricked into BCH, something they didn't even ask for, but now own anyway, because they simply got tricked. 


That's the argument. 




Imagine your dad wants to get into Crypto and starts with Bitcoin naturally. But you later find out that he bought BCH instead, because he bought it from bitcoin dot com and got mislead. He wanted Bitcoin, but bought BCH. 



What would you think? 



Would you also tell him, that there's a very large part of the Cryptocommunity saying, that he owns a scam? Would you tell him that and let him reevalute? 


You see the problem, right? 



Your philosophical fucking bullshit, on whether or not they can use the name, is absolutely irrelevant, because people buy the thing thinking it's Bitcoin, when it's simply fucking not. 



You think it's ok, that new buyers get tricked into rBTC, and get directed to buying Bitcoin Cash? You think they understand the underlying, very much politically originated issue, if they first enter the scene? No they fucking don't. They wanted Bitcoin, but go again mislead to the fake fucking thing. Could've been your girlfriend that got tricked. Would you tell her many think it's a scam she's holding and she will even inevitably get dumped by Chinese miners? ",1524811693

"The most correct answer. Bcash chose to incorporate a set of features which broke compatibility with the bitcoin network. It was not done so in a manner to attempt to gain consensus with the greater bitcoin network. The entire point was to become a minority fork.

"We already had this at 8 MB blocks with massive spam attacks.. guess what happened? Some actual 8 MB blocks were worked on and a few blocks later everything was fine again. Even though the fees are low, they are not that low, it would still cost millions to spam and cripple the network (And the moment you stop the large blocks quickly work through the transactions). Even with a massive attack we would just have a full mempool (Like Bitcoin) but it would get worked off in no time.",1524811562
"Time to stop referencing him then. Ezpz.

The difference is that some do not accept the SL chain as being the majority chain in context of all of the requirements. 

Such as SegWit by some not being considered the chain of signatures defining a coin in the design. Or even varying properties, such as the very important one of having a low fee which is influenced by another variable, the blocksize.

In any case Bitcoin BCH is never Bitcoin BTC at the same time and the properties of both systems make it clear what we are speaking of.

Saying that ""Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin"" can be an obvious philosophical statement. Provided the context is right it doesn't have to be fraud.",1524811538

"You guys keep yelling ""core this core that"" and simply can't accept that there are many, many people who know the argument between both sides and simply did not agree with your big blocks \+ purely on\-chain scaling plan.

On a personal note, I see it as a hopeless dead\-end with no way of evolving outside of Amazon and Alibaba servers.  You can trust in 0\-conf all you want \(even Satoshi said never to trust it\), you can keep pushing people by telling them that SPV clients are all that's needed because nodes are ""useless anyway"" and only mining rigs matter, but I wonder if you're even able to understand that so many people simply disagree with you.

I see BCH as very shortsighted in the long scheme of things.  I'm not a core shill but apparently r/btc will never accept that.  I don't belong there and probably never, ever will.  Think for yourself why BCH is one of the most hated coins in the cryptosphere.  On my end, I trade it in the lows, sell it at the highs.  I would never invest in it though.

BCH came out to destroy BTC, simple as that.  Let's not fool anyone and be frank with the whole forum.  The repercussions and simplification of that boils down to BCH maximalists versus BTC maximalists and all other altcoin lovers.  Think about that well.",1524811415

"Ugh, that hurrrts.

Lesson to take from it:

1.) Maybe we should stop being annoying to some people who already made their mind?

2.) Miners are important. We know. High fees at btc chain will indeed secure miners profits and attention. Bch is moving cost of transaction from users towards miners. There is no incentive for them to switch to bch unless its difficulty is low and require small resources to mine, or.....we gain enough users to convince miners that bch has future to exist and grow!!! Btc with current model might never go above its ath price and adoption. It has hit the ceiling lately and now is a little under, but not much space to grow.

Let's focus on adoption.

"Yep, that's the original Bitcoin project started by Satoshi himself.

If you look at that Github repo you linked to there's currently over 18 thousand forks of that repo. Most of those are not actually altcoins of course, a forked GitHub repo is common to do any kind of work on the repo so that you work on your own copy and submit a pull request for the original repo to pull in your changes.

Bitcoin Core is the name of the original implementation. Forever ago it was named Bitcoin-QT like the parent commenter said but after changing the name of the project to Bitcoin Core it's not like they started referring to Bitcoin the chain as Bitcoin core, it's always just been Bitcoin from day one.

"Hi bitusher,

1) This is a six month comparison chart, so I'd rather not cherry pick the highest conversion ever achieved between BTC/BCH and compare it to today's. If I were to do that with BTC's price in USD, it's a pretty significant drop (&gt;110%),for something which aims to be a 'store of value'.

2) 7-day SMA used in the hashpower calculation to avoid any accusations of cherry picking for this six month comparison. Given the increase in BCH's hashpower this week (which is being averaged down by the 7-day SMA calculation), this figure could actually have been significantly higher for BCH. People are free to check fork.lol or bitinfocharts.com if they want to verify both the figures and the trend. 

3) The batching argument is true, but weak. Anyone reading this willing to explore that statement should visit outputs.today and see the numbers themselves. Yes, some batching occurs. But there are still fewer outputs on the BTC network than there were six months ago. BCH has grown over the same time period. 

4) Until Segwit adoption reflects a full 4MB of weight per block, the network can't achieve the theoretical full tps of Segwit. It's been 9 months and Segwit adoption is still only [one third](http://segwit.party/charts/#). It doesn't appear to be increasing, either. 

5) The routing methods on LN mean this theoretical millions of tps isn't actually possible today, so this just isn't factually correct. LN [lost 20+% of its nodes just a few weeks ago to the equivalent of a DDoS](https://www.trustnodes.com/2018/03/21/lightning-network-ddos-sends-20-nodes). It can't handle that volume of traffic yet. However, one way of measuring how much of LN has *increased capacity* is by measuring how much *demand it has removed* from the main chain. This is what I've done, but unfortunately the LN network only has 15 BTC on it. One way of making this number fairer is to perhaps normalise this ""% of all BTC transferred to the LN"" figure by a measure of economic daily activity for BTC.

You don't understand. People who use e.g. western union don't give a shit about fiat pairs. They want to send money from A to B and even with all the crypto currencies available the only solution they can use is Western Union/Moneygram etc. Why? Because they don't have skills or means to use those fancy services you take for granted.

If fiat pairing would solve the problem then why aren't people using all the exchanges that offer fiat pairs for many currencies? Think about that and you have your answer why fiat pairing is not going to solve anything for nano.

&gt; Second, I don't like Ripple. It has fees and is centralized

I don't even know where to start. First of all there is no payment service that is used by hundreds of millions of people for free. Just because nano is free now doesn't mean shit. Nobody uses it so of course it can be free. VISA/Mastercard would be free if it was possible. But it isn't. Someone has to maintain commercially ready network, offer support, solve issues etc. That is not free.

Say I have a shop and I use nano. What if the transaction doesn't go through? What do I do? Are you saying I post issue on github/reddit or what? Do you really think that is what businesses are going to do? No. They need guarantees that someone will fix the problem for them and offers 99.xxxx guarantee that payments are processed. Your decentralized network cannot do that because it is decentralized!

About decentralization: Explain to me how you are going to build a decentralized network that supports millions of hundreds of millions users and transactions. I mean ex ETH devs building CARDANO say that it cannot be done but surely they must be stupid right? Did you know that those ex ETH devs are building CARDANO and try to fix all the shitty things that are wrong with ETH. 

Oh and about fees: *The current minimum transaction cost required by the network for a standard transaction is 0.00001 XRP* Go ahead and convert that to FIAT and then think about how big deal transaction fee is. 

Also https://ripple.com/dev-blog/decentralization-strategy-update/

As much as I wouldn't wish it on anyone, I promise you, you will get rekt. Not because you're dumb \(even though most of you are\), but because this is fucking crypto. One does not simply invest in crypto without getting rekt at least once. Running all over the place like you have a 12 inch dildo dipped in hot sauce up your ass screaming ""WOW LOOK AT OMG GO MAN, MOON, 25&amp;#37; INCREASE IN 5 SECONDS, VEN LOL, ICON, ONT, BAGS LAMBOS BITCHES HAHAHAHA"" is literally you just asking to get rekt.

Bitcoin ain't nothing to fuck with. She can legit go to $4,000 overnight and you'll all be crying again. Chill the FUCK out already and smarten up. Be more conservative with your predictions and, hopefully, you'll find yourself pleasantly surprised in the future. Blow up your predictions with insane, manic optimism and you are more likely to be disappointed. Sure, I hope the market cap goes to $100 trillion, but I'm not going to go around acting like crypto can't go anywhere but up. It's completely unpredictable, and it always goes down sooner or later.",1524806942

"**Law of triviality**

Parkinson's law of triviality is C. Northcote Parkinson's 1957 argument that members of an organisation give disproportionate weight to trivial issues. He provides the example of a fictional committee whose job was to approve the plans for a nuclear power plant spending the majority of its time on discussions about relatively minor but easy-to-grasp issues, such as what materials to use for the staff bike shed, while neglecting the proposed design of the plant itself, which is far more important and a far more difficult and complex task.

The law has been applied to software development and other activities. The term bike-shed effect or bike-shedding was coined as a metaphor to illuminate the law of triviality; it was popularised in the Berkeley Software Distribution community by the Danish computer developer Poul-Henning Kamp in 1999 and has spread from there to the whole software industry.

Pantera Capital, whoever the fuck they are, don't know any more than we do. They did their research and they took their best guess. If you believe that they know anything more than we do just because they have a website that says they are a crypto investing company is just flat out ignorant.

This will also reduce the amount of hate and negative energy that is spread towards bch and will attract more developers to contribute, users to use it, etc.

I feel the area to focus on in a marketing sense is actually differentiating itself from bitcoin, in a branding sense. Spread the message that this is bitcoin cash, not bitcoin. A good buzz word would be EVOLUTION. This is the evolution of bitcoin.

It's the same principle of why democracy does not work as well as it's usually thought, inercy.

Bitcoin is not a trademark someone owns, one of the ideas behind it was to have a network where there is not a single owner. Nobody has the right to claim or protect the name, so the loudest people tend to just take the name using violence.",1524804662
"The success of previous forks is hardly relevant in the question of is Bitcoin supposed to be forked or not. And so is this concept of ""consensus"". The point of decentralization is that small players can follow their own path if they want to. And that worst thing the majority can do is cry in reddit about scams and class action lawsuits that are never going to happen.

"The thing that is most astonishing about this is the thought that a 100% gain is not a good performance.  Some are predicting far more than that just for Bitcoin.  It's going to take some spectacular new innovation, still not demonstrated, to knock Bitcoin off the top of the heap.

On the other hand, if you really want to moon to stratospheric returns, find that next new thing early when it is still small cap and put all your chips on it.  Pay particular attention to credible claims about solving the scaling problem.",1524804527

"You ""adults"" that ""lost respect for the CEO"" need to understand that companies at different stages require different personalities to succeed.

When you are a small team trying to build on a revolutionary idea, you don't want a Fortune 500 CEO ""professional"" suit running the show, you need passion for the project and actual technical ability to push through.

Bruno has always been vocal, not always in the best way, but he has great vision and he has pretty much put all on the line for this project, and he came up with the core idea and is doing his best to make it work. He put his money where his mouth is, which, in this scam-filled wild west of a crypto world, is a big positive and is super rare.

Take a chill pill, if they deliver the promised utility, there is no way PRL won't moon, so, if you believe they can do so, this is a good time to get in, if you don't believe they will, then sell or don't buy in, it is that simple.

The nice thing about PRL is that it doesn't require a huge paradigm shift to work in the real world. If it delivers, people will use it, because it will have immediate real world tangible value.

all this political bickering is nonsense. BTC won the early round of this fight, and as long as it maintains a lead in functionality, it is likely to be the winner. BCH lost the early fight, but is still viable and in many ways has been more functional. If the BCH guys are right, their dedication will be a savior. 

if both continue, that isn't terrible, either. 

but all this disingenuous bickering is bad for the community. The fact is, that Roger Ver said some outrageously misleading things, and if it wasn't for his opponents being just as egregious and misleading on the other side, that likely would have been resolved within the BCH community.

"Look, I'm about as pro BCH as they come, but the truth is that the ticker, the hashrate, the repository, the exchanges, the wallets, the address serialization format, the difficulty adjustment, and the adoption all followed one chain after the august hardfork, and it wasn't the BCH chain.   

If someone intends to use a wallet to pay to a base58 P2PKH address in a wallet or on a website that states that they ""accept bitcoin"", then the truth is that they therefore want to buy BTC.  If someone says ""I accept bitcoin"" they almost always mean they accept a coin to a base58 P2PKH address .  If you buy bitcoin on an exchange, it means you are getting coins that are valid on a particular chain.  Etc.

if someone says they need to pay their cousin in bitcoin, and they have an address to pay to, and asks you to sell them ""bitcoin"" and you sell them BCH, you've *actively* committed fraud, and telling them ""Well I've done you a favor because BCH is better"" won't help them.

If a flippening happens and the BTC chain dies then so be it, the market has decided.

"&gt; Can someone help me understand the ""centralization"" arguments that some people are making against big blocks.

They are _completely_ unsubstantiated. Bitcoin's original blocksize was 32 MBs, with plans to increase it later as needed without problems. It was known that there would be less full mining nodes as the blockchain became bigger, as Satoshi himself said in 2010: [Satoshi Quote](http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/bitcointalk/287/). Non-mining full nodes do **nothing** to secure the network.

The story behind the refusal to increase the blocksize was eloquently written in [this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/informative_btc_vs_bch_articles/dl8v4lp/?st=jaotbt8m&amp;sh=222ce783).

The real risks of centralization come from the Lightning Network, which this short video details extremely well: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYHFrf5ci_g)

Fun fact: Ethereum's blockchain is bigger than BTC's yet has more full nodes. Why? _Usage_. Ethereum is _used_ more than Bitcoin, which is a result of Ethereum's efforts to scale as quickly and logically as possible (unlike BTC).",1524803377

This adventure has costed me as of this moment 200 USD more or less, but the knowledge I've got is, and will be, the greatest value obtained...

I was living what Socrates describes as an unobserved life, but not entirely... 

I've always been an introspect, was diagnosed with dislexia (this could be revised in the future, it could be that it was just a somewhat clever scam)... 

As a human I belive we are programmed to be egocentric, maybe is the rational survival instinct... So, I was somewhat blinded by this...

I think I'll investigate some on how to better write my ideas...

I never dwelled on how stuff works... (awesome podcast by the way, look it up) how our life is sustained, I've been living a 30 year old childhood, and I just hit puberty and asked myself. Why the fuck am I poor? Why the system is so broken? Hail socialism! OK not that far... I love me some consumism... 

And I'm far from being poor... Shit now I've learned what poor is, felt what poor is, seen what poor is... And that's why I say I was half blinded, I could see what was up there, you guys surfing and sky diving and watching magic shows at Las Vegas, shit your life is movie like!

But I didn't pay attention to what was down... People dissolving kids in acid, because one looked kinda like some one from other cartel...

Crypto brings a promise, brings hope... To people who live next door to this stories, please do not break that promise, bitcoin will get as far as their holders do, and some of this people have shared bitcoin with some others which cannot even read, much less understand economics, let's bring them up here, let's make them want to buy a TV and watch Netflix so they work and we all get a little more close to immortality...

Which really will just only give them more...

"1. SegWit fixes first-person malleability but only for transactions that spend using a SegWit signature (i.e. were received at a SegWit address). No SegWit, no BIP141 fix. What technically happens is that the signature isn't included in the transaction hash at all (it's stored as an ""addendum"" to the block and gets a byte-weight discount for fee calculations WRT hashed data), so transactions that spend only SegWit outputs won't have a different TXID even if a malleated signature is produced.

2. That's a good question. Lightning relies on unconfirmed TXID's to craft payment channel transactions, so some other method would be required to prevent first-party malleation possibly rendering a channel state invalid to the mining network. It's not impossible without SegWit, but building SegWit directly into Bitcoin validation rules makes it a whole lot easier than, say, waiting on or developing more advanced script operations that can provide another mechanism to prevent this potential for fraud.

3. Even better question. Couldn't even fathom the answer, myself, and I do try to see the ""most rational possible"" interpretation of the opposing argument whenever appropriate. ""Decentralization"" is sometimes a moving target; some people refer to hashrate, others to adoption, others to nodes; the decentralization that *is most critical to bitcoin* is that of mining pool operation. Pool competition is the necessary manifestation of the fundamental premise of bitcoin's security model. A pool with too much hashpower is a point-of-failure for the entire coin, and thus a risk to itself; competition is *healthy* for the competitors in the bitcoin mining industry because it protects themselves, their competitors, and the other non-mining transactors they service from potential attacks. Sure, decentralization of pool participants (within and across pools) helps, but if only one pool was mining they could potentially censor the whole network unrestricted (or be hacked to do so!) until more than half their participants formed one or more competing pools. The potential for chain control is the reason decentralization of mining pool operation is vital for the health of bitcoin, and is the only form of ""decentralization"" that I consider worthy of discussion. Decentralized nodes don't prevent centralized pools from censorship, nor do decentralized participants. Mining pools keep other mining pools honest through honest competition, by bitcoin's design. Individual miners can boycott against and/or compete with dishonest operators (by joining or starting a competitor).",1524802090

"&gt; In the current state of the market, the buyer/seller himself does not directly hold the weight, he entrusts his coins with a centralized exchange. Exchanges and other services act as sort of representatives in this matter, and of course the users can decide which services they want to use.

That is not true. People wanting to buy / sell /trade coins literally **are** the market. The exchange just facilitates the trade by connecting traders willing to make a deal. Sure the exchange can decide which consensus rules they want to follow but they can't force anyone to buy or sell any particualr chain and thats what drives the price. In the event of a fork, the market decides what each chain is worth, not the miners, not the exchanges, not the government, the market. 

Now granted, most market particiapnts right now don't give a flying fuck about the consensus rules so they just allow the exchanges to make that decision for them. But they do ultimately hold all the power themselves. The bitcoin split due to consensus rule disagreement, and one chain was really good and useful, and the other chain was really shitty and useless, eventually as the market begins to realize this, the desire for coins on the shitty chain drys up, and as such the price get REKT.",1524801577

The idea that miners need to be kept under control by heroic users sacrificing their resources to run full validating nodes is clearly Propaganda 101.

Bitcoin has a built-in mechanism to keep mining power in check. It's called the block reward. Miners are supposed to follow the rules of the network because that is the strategy which yields the highest returns for them. The higher the mining power, the higher the reward, and therefore the smaller the incentive to hurt the network. That alignment of incentives and its use together with Proof-of-Work to maintain consensus over a distributed ledger is one of the most remarkable innovations in Computer Science within the last few decades.

The idea that non-mining nodes provide protection against a majority of miners changing the rules is absurd. In reality, every non-mining node will get stuck at the last valid block according to their own set of rules, and that'll be the end of it. And the proposition that running nodes will become so expensive that literally nobody in the world except miners can even notice that the rules has no connection with the current reality of either BTC or BCH.",1524800803

There is no point in a non-mining full node. Their idea is that it leads to less centralization because more people have a copy of the entire blockchain.

It is, however, only natural to believe that someone else is constantly cheating the system. But in reality, doing the kind of dump-and-pump scam that the whales supposedly get away with every time is actually really, really hard and prone to all kinds of errors.

I can guarantee that during those times when a whale actually dumps, they wrestle with a ton of risk and often lose the battle. There is no foolproof recipe for making money through such schemes.

Furthermore, a lot of price plunges are not caused by whales at all, but by the stop-loss algorithms of traders. A lot of those people follow the same technical analysis, and so when any movement happens it causes a domino effect.

So don't let Roger Ver's FUD news site get you down. Bitcoin is not controlled by some shadowy cabal of uber-whales. It's just a technology that can't be controlled, and uncontrollable things are bound to make big movements at times that are not always convenient.",1524798947

"&gt; If bitcoin sinks down to nothing, the bcash boat tied to it will go down with

Well, perhaps not if the reason for that sinking is because bcore refused to scale, and the adoption simply moves to BCH.  But yes, there are several scenarios where both would go down together.

&gt; Bitcoin cash needs to sell itself as it's own currency, a better version of bitcoin and not impersonate bitcoin itself. 

A great many of the people Bitcoin Cash is attracting are people who were turned off by what Bitcoin Core has become and/or is becoming.  Bitcoin was never supposed to be a useless store of value, it wasn't supposed to become overly complicated because of boogeymen, and it wasn't supposed to be propped up by censoring disagreement for years on end.

That said, you're not completely wrong - it does need to stand on its own as better than Core - but neither should it forget the legacy &amp; the goals that drove the fork in the first place.

&gt; You have to agree the website is being deceitful, Right?

I do not personally like the way Bitcoin.com is pushing the labeling, no.  I don't think Bitcoin Cash will ever become ""BTC"" or ""Bitcoin"" again.  They lost that chance because they didn't keep the economy (in part because they forked prematurely when 2x was still on).  If they were to change the website back so it said ""Bitcoin Core"" followed by ""Bitcoin Cash"" I would think that is fine - Both of forks derived from the concept everyone knew as ""Bitcoin"", each for their own reasons with their own vision.  I don't like when people write ""Bitcoin (Cash)"" as that's pushing the verbiage too hard.

Personally the whole issue is pretty stupid.  If rBitcoin dropped the bcash nonsense and rBtc just used ""BCH"" for most cases and Bitcoin Cash for everything else, there wouldn't much of a problem left to fling poop over.",1524798125

"&gt; If Segwit did not activate, how would that have affected Lightning? I've seen at least 3 different videos explaining Lightning and they all clam that Lightning is ""dangerous"" or ""unsafe"" without Segwit.

The full story of why segwit was activated was explained in the below link by computer science professor Jorge Stolfi, which I highly encourage you to read. Basically, segwit was only necessary because the BTC development team refused to do a hardfork, which would have been a much cleaner way of doing things. Segwit was not needed to fix malleability. It was just a convoluted way of doing it _with out_ having to hardfork. So in this sense, I guess it was necessary (since they refused to do a hardfork).

Correct. Estimates I've seen from plenty of smart people say that LN would not even remotely be possible with out at least hundred(s) of megabytes sized blocks.

"It's being downvoted and censored (respectively) because it's a dead topic. But you nailed it in a reply here about Roger Ver:

&gt; He reminds me of that kid in HS that gets so frustrated when people disagree with his beliefs that people poke at him just for fun cause he gets so worked up so easy.

That's the exact problem. That's the *center of the problem*, right there. People pick on him because they **can** and they use it to slander Bitcoin Cash because **they can**. He does what he does because he's still that same person, prone to irrational and childish responses to the irrational and childish behavior that drove him to the irrational frustration that he expresses. The problem is, Roger's behavior *isn't* representative of Bitcoin Cash or its developers and instead of focusing on the tech, people insist on playing the blame game and it always boils down to this *exact. same. thing.* It always comes back to something Roger said on video. That's not a technical debate, it's a personal attack (and when it's not Ver, it's Craig Wright).

People spread ""bcash"" well before the infamous interview *because* they knew it irritates him - just as much as how irritating it is that the world-changing project he's been involved with longer than you or I is being upended, derailed, and served to the powers-that-be on a silver platter by a handful of people that get their entertainment from picking on somebody that is passionate and dedicated enough to actually express such irritation in the first place. It's disgusting behavior. Does it justify childish responses in a professional capacity? No, never, but his response does not arbitrarily justify the original action, either. We do not forget the fact that you poked an alligator just because an alligator bit your arm off. Let's look at the whole picture here: which side is focusing their messaging on Bitcoin and which side is focusing their messaging on attacks? What are the purposes of the stupid ""bcash"" and ""bitcoin cash is bitcoin"" war-memes? Who is resorting to anonymous crowd-sourced propaganda and twitter bots, and who is resorting to public appearance and live conference?

Knowledge is power, and I spend a lot of time here providing historical information to visitors - knowledge you obviously have, knowledge that defeats these attacks and dispels the illusion of a ""mere"" civil war.",1524794596

"LN in theory might be secure but is still very much new and the clients are in beta today. There's no telling if the current implementations are perfectly safe. I think his point is rather that payment channels are established via standard bitcoin transactions and bitcoin smart contract and you can't send money that you don't have via LN tx.

Also I'm a big fan of LN but imo it's not as safe to receive funds with it than receiving funds directly on chain if you don't have the mean to monitor your channels. It's great for retail tx since retail POS are online anyways and it avoids having to write your every personal retail tx on a permanent ledger, it's also great for high thruput of tx between two parties (but any bitcoin payment channel will do in that case).

But for large value tx I don't think it's as useful since you probably don't care about paying a fee that allows you to be in the first block as the sender (when network is congested) and also might not care about speed and rather wait for a lot of confirmation as the receiver.

"While I don't support calling BCH 'Bitcoin' in that drop down, I also don't support you calling Bitcoin Cash ""bcash"", or claiming that it's centralized.

History is on the side of large\-block\-Bitcoin, aka BCH, and not 1\-MB\-block\-Bitcoin, aka BTC.

The majority of major Bitcoin companies wanted Bitcoin to evolve by hard forking to larger blocks, in accordance with the plan described in [the original Bitcoin Wiki](https://web.archive.org/web/20111102180731/https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability). Bitcoin Core opposed the hard fork.

At one point nearly every major Bitcoin company, as well as the majority of hashing power, was supporting on\-chain scaling, via the BitcoinXT initiative:

[https://bitcoinxt.software/industry\-letter.pdf](https://bitcoinxt.software/industry-letter.pdf)

Which was also supported by the original Bitcoin Core developer Gavin Andresen, and BitcoinJ developer Mike Hearn. Jeff Garzik, another Bitcoin Core developers in support of on\-chain scaling, created the BIP 100 proposal.

Later, even more Bitcoin companies signed up for the much more modest Segwit2x initiative:

[https://medium.com/@DCGco/bitcoin\-scaling\-agreement\-at\-consensus\-2017\-133521fe9a77](https://medium.com/@DCGco/bitcoin-scaling-agreement-at-consensus-2017-133521fe9a77)

In both cases the majority of Bitcoin Core developers opposed the change.

We already know, judging by the Reddit community's reaction, that the Bitcoin community would have gone with Gavin Andresen's BitcoinXT client, if Theymos hadn't started deleting all BitcoinXT posts from r/bitcoin and banning anyone who disagreed:

In addition to the rampant censorship, there were massive DDoS attacks on all BitcoinXT and Bitcoin Classic nodes:

When he could simply say. ""they call it Bcash and so be it but I believe its the true Satoshi vision so I call it Bitcoin and will promote it as such. He reminds me of that kid in HS that gets so frustrated when people disagree with his beliefs that people poke at him just for fun cause he gets so worked up so easy. Also if you have Bitcoin and it forks neither fork really has any more authority over the other, its open source. So to list it Bitcoin on his website while listing Core's forked coin Bitcoin Core IS misleading and shows immaturity. If he wants to do Bitcoin Core then he needs to do Bitcoin ABC or do Bitcoin (Cash) Bitcoin (Core). its just immature.

Also my parents who are seniors and all their friends that they have gotten into the crypto space who get their news from traditional outlets like Finance Yahoo etc all think he is a yahoo fraud scammer.

"Happy to explain it as I see it.

Fed could absolutely buy and hold.  The problem is that no value transfer would occur so it would simply be an attempt to stall or halt network activity.  (Could easily spike the price of BTC).

However, if that value is transferred to another network then it's a risk free move that has the side benefit of lower transaction activity on the BTC network in addition to negatively impacting the value of BTC.

At the same time the sidechain could be pegging ETH and LTC along with any others that are susceptible and transferring that value to the new Fedcoin network. 

This means the game theory all in effect that most are waiting for to occur with BTC which will ultimately cause the massive MacAFee spike to occur would be neutralized for BTC but very likely to occur on the Fedcoin network that is now absorbing all major MCap coin values.  This would most likely create a BTC/ETH/LTC deflationary waterfall effect; devaluing the coins against the value absorbing Fedcoin as the price for Fedcoin skyrockets.

In the end the fees/block rewards and overall activity would be far too costly for the miners to continue to profit based on the cost for PoW.  (Not sure how it would effect PoS but doubt it would be good).

Ultimately, the value of coins would most likely crash but it may make your BTC more valuable (I'm not a prophet) - good luck trading it for anything other than $ and/or Fedcoin.

"Now THAT is the kind of information and conversation I expect to see! Thank you for sharing!

Not as eloquently or accurately stated, but I've kind of explained some of these mechanisms in an analogy to my group of peers. See, crypto in certain areas, is like running around your hometown and trying to purchase goods with foreign money. If I (In the US) were to give a clerk a Canadian dime while purchasing a Coke, they would probably not say much and accept it. Possibly even replace it with another dime and keep that one, depending on how they felt about it.

Now, if I were to go into Home Depot and try to purchase a new lawn mower with Japanese Yen equivalent to $1300 USD...I can guarantee you it wouldn't go over so well..

It has monetary value equivalent to the price of the good and is accepted as the primary payment in a highly populated country. I can trade my USD legally for it online and through the NY Exchange or broker.. Yet, I'd still have trouble spending it at Al's Convenience Store or a chain grocery store.

I'm sure there are flaws to this analogy, but it has helped put a few things in perspective for myself concerning economics and adoption thereof. So, maybe someone can find value in it. 

Pun intended. 😉",1524788718

- if more people trade directly in fiat pairs, the liquidity moves from coin/BTC pairs to fiat pairs thus reducing arbitrage possibilities, you can't earn much on arbitrage is the liquidity is low (pretty much how you can find some *great* arbitrate possibilities on CoinMarketCap exchanges overview, but those usually have extremely low liquidity on not that popular exchanges where the price is *out of sync*",1524787849

"&gt;Your premises are flawed. Decentralized validation is useless in keeping the network safe.

We found the core of the disagreement between different scaling camps! I completely agree that if I accepted the above premise, I would totally agree with the points you're making, but I don't.

Decentralized validation is exactly what keeps mining power in check, and prevents their easy to locate, capital intensive nature from being targets of coercion. If Bitcoin's users give up their ability to collectively confirm the rules (economic, and ownership) are being followed by letting the resources needed to do so grow out of their reach, they'll have no recourse at all for any changes any majority of miners decides is best for the network. SPV will follow along (blindly) regardless of what sort of changes to monetary policy or other rules a cartel of miners decide to adopt.

I'm sure you disagree, as many people seem to, and I fully admit I could be overestimating that danger or be misunderstanding the game theory problem that I'm seeing. But until I can convince myself otherwise, I'll be holding on to some BTC.

&gt;Guess what does help against mining decentralization. Adoption.

The funneling effect you are referring to has nothing to do with Bitcoin but trading / investing in ANYTHING. Bitcoin is a macro level  idea and the fact that you would try to compare the idea of Bitcoin with traders doing their thing is laughable.

No offense but you got into this in October because of money and not because you are trying to ""bank the unbanked."" As far as your investment you could have made money investing in literally anything if you got in around october. So your point about studying doesn't mean anything. 

Investing based on talks and promised will only get you so far. We are speculating which coins will deliver and which won't.

Some people say there’s a war going, on but there’s no war.  One side has used censorship, mass-banning, and corrupt behavior to misinform most new people in this space. 

Those of us who were here back in 2012 remember watching this play out. We were the ones screaming at the devs to increase Bitcoins capacity and make it more functional and innovative. 

They literally didn’t give a shit.  And that’s what spawned [Bitcoin Cash](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/929558722170429440?s=21), Bitcoin Unlimited, BitcoinXT, and all the other attempts to bypass the Core development team.

I'd be so rich and I totally wouldn't have sold anything at $4 trillion"", however saying a random number with no time frame at all has zero meaning. Sure $40 trillion is a possibility, $100 trillion is also a possibility; you know what else is a possibility? Total market cap never getting past $2 trillion, or never getting past $1 trillion.  
No one knows what the price of Bitcoin will be in the future, nor the total market cap.

Segwit has changed the ordering of tx data and signature data in a way that allowed unwanted transaction malleability to be fixed (and for the blocksize limit to be increased via soft fork), but any segwit-supporting node that was archiving the whole blockchain before continues to archive the whole blockchain with segwit--signature data and all.

It drives miners to choose the transactions with higher fees which in turn creates a ""unfair"" system as transactions aren't ordered in creation time.

Bitcoin is inherently an inflationary currency. The supply of the currency is increasing constantly at a set interval, and never decreases, it is never technically deflationary. Hoarding of the currency can cause functional deflation, as there's less active currency in the supply being circulated, so the demand for the coins themselves can go up and the dollar value goes up with it. That itself is not technical deflation.

&gt; Not in any way. The amount you can buy with it shifts constantly.

But, regardless of all the procedures we follow, mistakes do happen and, unfortunately, today we encountered a minor hiccup where some of the emails sent via our marketing team had other email addresses included in the ""to:"" field. This was a non-critical problem, but a very inappropriate event that shouldn't happen - and we deeply apologize for that!

Emails contained a reminder that KYC form has opened for some new Eventum members without any sensitive information being exposed. A mistake happened when recipient variables for email personalization inside the marketing tool were removed, and our transactional email provider recognized the job as a general email campaign instead of a personalized one - which meant other addresses were included as CC instead of BCC. We guarantee all personal information is safely stored and additional methods were already implemented that will prevent similar things to happen in the future.

Indeed, one might see those vested interests and idealogical decision trying to fit a round peg in a square hold are real culprit slowing down technological progress, due to all the distractions from the *actual* science of all this.

Would we let those VC's that helped put the funding together for the Large Hadron Collider tell us how the engineers ought to smash atoms together?

It'd be a fair statement to say that neither BTC nor BCH are doing particularly well in that department. Mining is significantly more centralized that we would want it to be. However, 1MB blocks and SegWit are entirely immaterial in the fight against mining centralization, since block transmission, storage and validation are only a tiny fraction of the cost of mining.

Guess what *does* help against mining decentralization. Adoption.

"I feel like you've done minimal research into the project of REQ and just made this thread.

Request is a network, so it's not really what the dev team does but moreso what the community does. As of now there's also only Eth allowed for the network. I do believe there's been coding for both bitcoin oracle and ERC-20 tokens both being worked on. That is the true main door opener for REQ to be live and working. Then once that's working it's entirely up to the community and devs to make the project explode. 

Similarly there's been A LOT of news regarding the programs being ran on it. Chango, Donaid and quite a few others. 

REQ is a network, networks take time. Their partnership with DAO and kyber will be massive as well if everything goes according to my speculation.  

Just makes me sad to see someone make a post without even doing a minute worth of research about what's being developed on REQ. Price doesn't matter at all for REQ at the current moment. If you want to make money short term invest into TRON, EOS, or any random moonshot shill coin. If you're fine holding for any time longer then a month that's where network coins come into play. REQ, NEO, ICON, AION etc are all the future if they continue to adopt useable usecases. 

But to tl;dr this, REQ still doesn't have much to show for the development. But, the groundwork is there. I can see it doing very well if everything stay at the current pace they're going, although to see major price movement you need to see adoption and more development on those community apps.",1524780971
"Big blocks require miners to be ""professional"". They require miners to have an expensive high-bandwidth connection, then to have dedicated ASIC miner devices which are again very expensive ($10.000+). This is the true centralization: regular John Doe is unable to invest this much, so mining becomes a _hardware business_. And where is least expensive to run a hardware business? In China, of course.

Keeping 51-60% of hashrate in China allows the Chinese government to take over BTC/BCH network at anytime. Economic incentive doesn't have anything to do with this, this is pure politics, where actions of players often appear irrational. Of course they won't do it now, or this year, or anywhere in the next decade. They will wait until hyperbitcoinization, then using the overwhelming hashrate they will keep the entire world hostage by threatening to pull the plug on mining..",1524780966

BTC : $1.6/transaction

BCH : $0.005/tx

a few months ago BTC fees rised to &gt;$50 per transaction (BCH remained sub 1cent)

That's why BCH was created: because most applications like your betting site make no sense with unpredictable high fees. 

My guess is you will have almost 0 clients as long as you are on BTC because of this. Switching to BCH is the easy solution (it's the same tech).

for example satoshidice.com closed years ago because of BTC fees and reopened this year on BCH",1524780739
"You say my logic is misleading but offer nothing which supports that claim, what a surprise.

&gt;Clearly you don't have consensus as many users use BCH so, the consensus you envision does not exist.

You don't seem to understand the concept of consensus very well. The consensus I ""envision"" is that changes only happen when there is consensus (unless you want to create an alt-coin, you're always free to do that without permission). There was consensus for SegWit to activate, (as I said a 95% super majority of miners signaled for it) so it activated. There was no consensus for a block size increase, so that proposal was not implemented. That's lack of consensus in action. There was consensus among 21 Bitcoin Unlimited people to create create an alt-coin, BCH, so it was created. Consensus (or collectivism, the thing you're not interested in) is a feature, not a bug. It prevents the global system from being altered to fit the wants of a minority, whether that's a government or someone like Jihan Wu. That's the whole point of decentralization.    

Looking at your supposed email evidence that Bitcoin was MEANT to increase the block-size, I see ""block-size"" not mentioned, even once. This is not even weak evidence, there's no evidence at all. It's even written at least a year before Satoshi himself decided to reduce the block size to 1 MB, so even if he said in 2008 that *he meant* for block-size to become bigger (which it seems he did not)*he changed his mind* in 2010. Even if there was an intention for that block-size decrease to be temporary (and I don't see evidence of any such intention) there's certainly no indication of *how temporary*. A decade? A century? Who are you, (or anyone) to say that time is up? The answer is all of us (collectivisim, that thing you're not interested in) and the mechanism is consensus.    

&gt;You call BCH centralised for having centralised planers as if BTC didn't have a bunch of programers deciding. 

The BTC programmers you accuse of being deciders write software and then, very deliberately, make activation contingent on others to adopt or not. That's OBVIOUS from examples such as SegWit. If developers had any control SegWit would have been activated as soon as it was delivered. Instead the community argued about it for 9 months. You even acknowledge this yourself when you say ""programers don't matter"". That's a self contradiction. My logic is not misleading, it just conflicts with your illogical beliefs.

As for your ton of Bitcoin enthusiasts now on BCH, that's not shocking news. I debated block-size with many people here and elsewhere for years. Since BCH was an air drop everyone got some, naturally fans of big blocks are ""now on BCH"". Nonetheless, it would appear ""a ton"" of Bitcoin enthusiasts dumped those air dropped tokens on the market and remained with BTC, including and especially ""a ton"" of the exact same Bitcoin enthusiasts from 2012.

BCH will also have more stuff than predicted in the white paper, but deviating much much less. Satoshi didn't put the script language that way for nothing, he wanted smart contracts.

"So yeah I've been following and participating in SM discussions for a while, including writing code to simulate selfish mining and either validate or invalidate the theory. 

Someone published a paper, I found what I think is a problem with it, I commented on that in the very channel dedicated to discussion of that topic asking some questions and noting my findings. The author happened to respond. We had a bit of a technical back and forth. I really don't know what else you want or expect. 

Then I wrote code to simulate the 2 independent timelines approach here, using an exponential distribution of blocks found independently by selfish and honest mine: http://tpcg.io/yCs1he  . 

This approach models closely ( or at least that was the idea) the parallel timeline model I saw in CSW's paper. I was surprised to find that this method actually still generates the same selfish mining results predicted by theory except at the extremes 49% or 50% hash rate.

As for negative binomial, that describes the probability of a certain number of successes before a specific number of failures. And some people have the idea that SM must get 2 blocks in a row before honest miner in order to win any blocks. This is actually false. This scenario: ---S------H------S  results in a 2 block win for selfish miner. They keep mining on their first S block even when new H block comes, then when second S block comes, they publish both their blocks. So sometimes revisiting this is useful.

As for testing on a testnet, well that was discussed at one point. In fact CSW was offering people a bounty a while back to prove or disprove selfish mining using such a technique or something like it. The person that took up the challenge actually ended up getting hired by nChain. We are still waiting for results. I heard maybe something coming out in May but check with them. I was going to write my own simulation using multiple independent machines to represent honest and selfish miners, using something just approximating bitcoin (but with real mining &amp; real difficulty adjust). Now I'm not sure I still have the motivation.

"The investor usually isn't the one liquidating, it's the exchange they used.  The investor  goes short or long on leverage up to 100x and once the trade starts going the other way, the exchange will liquidate the trade because the exchange doesn't want to be on the hook incase the trader can't pay.  

Example:  I short 1 BTC with leverage of 100x.  For every dollar BTC moves I either make $100 or lose $100.  So if I short at say $9k and it goes down to $8.7k, now I owe $30k to cover the short, so the exchange will just liquidate my position and collect the $30k instead of taking the chance it goes down even further and I can't pay up.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8f1v30/big\_blocks/](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8f1v30/big_blocks/)

&gt;Now seriously.  Lightning IS going to require a hard fork block size  increase.  That's in the road map.  How is a block size increase done 1  or 2 years from now not going to centralize nodes the way everyone fears  Bitcoin Cash will?

Learn to fucking read you muppet. I clearly explained this already. Core uprading the block size a little bit at a time is not the same as unlimited blocks.  Bcash is already going 32MB next month. Bitcoin may not even increase the blocks at all for the next couple of years. By the time Bitcoin goes 4MB what will Bcash be at 128? 256? Not that it matters as Bcash is so unpopular it currently is only using less tha half of 1&amp;#37; of the current 8MB blocks for transactions.

&gt;They really are not.  None of the core developers are in any way  involved in Lightning.  There are three independent groups involved in  Lightning development right now, and they're basically all just coding  the white paper in different languages.  Core didn't even come up with  Segwit.  That was a third party in Asia.

You really are clueless aren't you. I'm talking about making the blockchain efficient not fucking Lightning. Im talking about thing like MAST and Schnorr signatures.

The 3 independent groups working on lightning are all working on different clients and working together as whole to improve the network. You really think that programmers and computer scientist are just wasting their time translating the white paper?

Oh Core didn't develop Segwit now? All your muppet friends in /rbtc are convinced Segwit was a poison pill forced onto Bitcoin from the Core developers to benefit Blockstream, now they didn't even make it? Can you even remember what narrative your supposed to be shilling anymore?

&gt;To be honest, there isn't a single thing in your comments that hasn't  been parroted by dozens of other people in this subreddit.  Do you truly  understand how this technology works at a technical level, enough to  make informed decisions, or do you just follow the crowd and say ""Big  blocks bad, Segwit good.""

"&gt; SW transactions use more space if the network achieves what it is set out to do which is 100% SW transactions

Again, you are *wrong* about this.  A segwit transaction vs a non-segwit transaction of the same type (ie. equivalent numbers of inputs, outputs, etc.) will serialize to nearly the same number of bytes on the Segwit chain.  They will differ by a few bytes due to legacy encoding requirements; the number of bytes stored will *not* differ ""exponentially"" as you claimed.  Segwit transactions are *not* less efficient (or more efficient) in the number of bytes stored.  That link I provided states this explicitly, and gives a worked example.

&gt; the only way that storage is reduced is by eliminating the witnesses meaning you can no longer fully verify the blockchain

Yes, and I am not claiming that storage is reduced by Segwit either.  If the witness data is retained, both types of transaction are almost exactly equal in size.

&gt; if the actual block size is raised it exacerbates that additional storage problem. It may not be exactly exponential but it may as well be

*If* the block size was raised by BTC, the amount of storage used would be linear and proportionate to the amount by which the limit is raised.  Ie. doubling the maximum block size would mean storing double the amount of bytes (for full blocks).  If I'm wrong, provide a counter example.  I've already provided a link that shows otherwise.

Your basic understanding of this (admittedly confusing) subject is incorrect.

&gt; I am not spreading falsehood

You are.",1524778831
"Something like three years ago /r/bitcoin prophets were already fearing that, while the Bitcoin value was ~$400, that miners would not make enough to be supported by fees. They were using this as the reason why they should artificially keep the block size 1M or even lower it! 

This is an old and very flawed trope. Obviously, the reason that block reward schedule slowly backs off is to not abruptly change the rewards and to slowly increase scarcity by lowering the amount of new coins introduced to the system; it is designed to drive up the value. Manipulating the block size limit may have threw off the whole schedule and screwed with the planned increase in the coin's value. If Bitcoin's value is not high enough for fees to sustain miners, then block reward schedule that Satoshi very carefully calculated is a failure. This schedule would ideally be planned out as if no scaling issues could happen and everything would just work up to the end, with the concession that predicted and un-predicted scaling improvements could and would be done along the way.

If you've been there since the beginning of this argument like me, looking back it is just soul crushing. Keeping the block size small was a tactic being pushed, way before they had settled on a technical reason for doing so. It is hard to not suspect bad actors hiding behind the scenes were not behind spreading this concept to cripple Bitcoin. It is hard to not wonder if this crippling wasn't more than just a profit driven company and some stubborn idealists, but a carefully planned co-opting, infiltration, and destruction by an intelligence agency. Divide and conqueror would have just been a happy accident. You must remember the balance of world power is at stake and governments have killed and toppled regimes for daring to dethrone their currency's monetary power.

Linux is trademarked. It's also open source. If you want to call software Linux you need permission from the Linux Foundation.

There's nothing stopping everyone on Bitcoin from making an identical fork with a trademarkable name and having a central organization like the Linux Foundation register the trademark and have the power to sue anyone who uses the trademark without permission. You know, to help with permissionless decentralization.

Looks like people don't actually care about that though since there's no effort to move the project to a name that can be trademarked. they just want to beat a horse to death because they only started to care about Bitcoin having a trademark when it looked like it would go against their self interest.

If people are just upset that they can't afford to mine and so complain about big blocks, then they should participate in the protocol and earn enough to mine and become a miner.

"**Rent-seeking**

In economics and in public-choice theory, rent-seeking involves seeking to increase one's share of existing wealth without creating new wealth. Rent-seeking results in reduced economic efficiency through poor allocation of resources, reduced actual wealth-creation, lost government revenue, increased income inequality, and (potentially) national decline.

Attempts at capture of regulatory agencies to gain a coercive monopoly can result in advantages for the rent seeker in a market while imposing disadvantages on (incorrupt) competitors. This constitutes one of many possible forms of rent-seeking behavior.

Their selling causes the price to drop, or at least contributes to it.

Yes. Only Bitcoin will ever be bitcoin. Consensus is not about ""competing chains"" in the sense that you are describing. Competing chains refers to honest nodes and dishonest nodes not having immediate consensus on which chain is legitimate, *on the same network*.

This is why it says that in order for an *attacker* to succeed, they would need to go back and do the PoW for all of the blocks mined by the honest nodes to ""catch up"", and that a ""slow attack"" is statistically close to impossible.

"You are seriously dense.

So anyone that even slightly questions the narrative is an automatic Bitcoin Cash shill?!

Seriosuly.  Calm the f*ck down.

Now seriously.  Lightning IS going to require a hard fork block size increase.  That's in the road map.  How is a block size increase done 1 or 2 years from now not going to centralize nodes the way everyone fears Bitcoin Cash will?

&gt;Oh look, my original comment was correct. You weren't here just asking questions, you're a bcash shill with an agenda just like I said you were. Imagine that.

This is genuine question and NOT at attempt to shill.  Are things being put in place to make large block mining ""safer"" in the future than it is now with how Bitcoin Cash went about it?  If they are, what are those things and where can I read about them?

&gt;There is a big difference between gradually raising the block size a little bit at a time, only as needed rather than just opening the flood gates and jumping straight into huge massive blocks and cramming every micro transaction into a bloated blockchain.

Isn't that kind of what Segwit 2X was trying to do?  Gradually increase the block size when congestion was at it's worst?  Yeah, I know that Segwit 2X was a big cluster**** when it activated.  But that was really because no one was working on it but one guy.  Had some core developers helped the guy out, I think it could have been a success.

&gt;The difference here is that the Core developers are actually innovating and creating ways to optimize blocks and make the blockchain as efficient as possible before having to increase the block size.

They really are not.  None of the core developers are in any way involved in Lightning.  There are three independent groups involved in Lightning development right now, and they're basically all just coding the white paper in different languages.  Core didn't even come up with Segwit.  That was a third party in Asia.

&gt; ~~Bcash~~ Bitcoin Cash is just using the blockchain as a garbage dump thinking they can just keep increasing the blocks endlessly without repercussions.

This could very well be the case.  But isn't it great that we have two different coins right now that have taken different approaches to the same problem?  3-5 years from now, we'll see which approach was the better one, based on which coin the market has chosen to abandon.  Bitcoin has always had Litecoin to test future technologies, such as Segwit and Lightning.  But no one has tried a larger block before.  I'm curious to see how it will play out.  Big Blocks could be the answer.  Or they could be a disaster.  That's for the market to decide.

To be honest, there isn't a single thing in your comments that hasn't been parroted by dozens of other people in this subreddit.  Do you truly understand how this technology works at a technical level, enough to make informed decisions, or do you just follow the crowd and say ""Big blocks bad, Segwit good.""

I COMPLETELY admit that I am in favor of a block size increase over an off chain solution such as Lightning.  I think it's needlessly complicated.  But that doesn't automagically make me a bcash shill.  There are lots of other cryptos out there that don't plan to deploy Segwit or Lightning.  None of the other coins out there have a transaction volume that would justify deploying either Segwit or Lightning.  TBH, I'm not really sure why Litecoin even did it.",1524776556

"My frustration just got re-directed at you and came out really really harshly. Anyhow, I get it, and looking at who is running a project makes sense. Roger's just following the train taking credit for where the tracks run. Gavin Andresen (first dev on Bitcoin BTC) has put out contributions for BCH. Amaury Sechet does a lot of the development. Peter Rizun, too. There's a long history there of two different ideologies about scaling, and as a developer, I think bitcoin core's approach is a dead-end. I wish Roger would shut up so the coin could win on it's own technical/economic merits. My belief is that cash + store of value will beat out store of value (btc) because it will be more useful to hold. But instead the personal drama makes that discussion hard to have.",1524776433
"&gt;Of course Satoshi could be daft and not care about his work (which took decades to figure out) and leave it for the first billionair that wanted to shit on it to do so. Does not make sense, though.

What does make sense? Did he forget all the times open source projects had dispute about trademarks or did he consciously choose not to register a trademark?

The time for trademarking bitcoin is over. You can't trademark bitcoin anymore than you can trademark ""Aspirin"" or ""videotape"", which were both brand names that lost their trademarks. The only people who could have legitimate claim to trademark let it go.

If you're really desperate for a trademark, there is nothing stopping everyone who currently uses bitcoin to fork an identical copy with a new trademarked name and setting up some authority to sue trademark violations (which is what you need to do if you want to keep a trademark). I'm sure that authority can help ensure the decentralized permissionless message of TrademarkCoin for years to come. So long as the people running that authority are trustworthy and don't abuse ownership of trademark for their own benefit.

The old bitcoin would become worthless, and roger ver would be left with a fake copy of a worthless coin.

that is of course if what people really care about is protecting the message in the Genesis block with the power of US government trademark law.

You might say our greatest innovation is that it is the most thorough... or at least most intimate... KYC/AML verification in existence.

Don't worry, I am protected because I have a cabal of mischievous fanbois who can see no wrong as they reap the free money from forking their coins. Besides, they already blew me so it couldn't be that bad. How dare you question their integrity.

One day I decided that my interpretation of a vaguely written document almost a decade ago could be translated into everyone sucking my cock, and I found the ""most reputable"" Chinese mining cabal and ostracized / outcast devs I know to make my own fork.

And I won't be bothered to come up with a reference client, keeping the actual machinations themselves able to be changed whenever the fuck I want as the dev pool that supports it is tiny and so on a small leash that I can maintain via dangling my blow'cash in front of.

Oh, and did I mention mine is the true bitcoin? Every other fork is more centralized or shill developed, infested with feds and corporates. Oh, and don't worry about the valuation, I am an early whale and the mining cabal has profited greatly from exploiting ASIC, so we can literally burn that % advantage on PR/Marketing and pumping, since, hey, it's just a fork and we also have all those other imposter fork coins, you know, to sell off and cause well timed price changes we can profit on either side of!

"BlockArray (ARY) has been a great investment during the bear market. Price aside, they have been working hard as a US Based company focused on the trucking industry's changing regulations. 
I am quoting another redditor /u/MFDOOM666:  
&gt; ARY has major technological updates on the horizon. April 25, 2018, ARY implements their API/SDK for ChainProof Data Verification and Anchoring.  
This major update to their platform brings them one step closer to being an important player in the shipping industry with their network supported by the blockchain. ARY does not disappoint this week with a second major update occurring only two days later.  
On April 27, 2018, ARY has their second important milestone for the week. Their Dapp Beta/Audit takes place. Their escrow Beta is ensuring the Ethereum transfers work flawlessly while also performing a Dapp Beta/Audit. ARY is reaching their milestones even after their ICO concluded in the middle of the prior market correction.  
With the ARY team clearly focused and not worried about market fluctuations look for their updated platforms to continue to increase the utility of the ARY. Once the ARY becomes fully utilized to value will truly soar. However, it is very important to see ARY continue to reach each important milestone in their roadmap as crypto is often inundated with delays.  
ARY is currently trading at $0.19 with a market cap of over $12 million. This is over ~50 percent lower than the $0.43 it was trading on January 31, 2018. As ARY successfully reaches milestones expect their price to continue to trend North as it has been doing since March 18. With a great team, a niche market they are focused on, and a platform regularly being updated and built it looks like this ICO seems to have survived the correction and can possibly have significant market adoption.

The OP said that the ""entire purpose"" of Bitcoin was cheap/payments under 2 seconds. It was not the entire purpose. I am entirely right.

Search for the comment where I point to Satoshi's comments on 0/conf and the inherent latency of transactions in a PoW based system if you don't understand why.

Do you think Satoshi's goal was *entirely* to come up with a cheap, fast payments system? If no, stop trying to argue with me as we agree. If yes, well, you have much to learn in addition to improving on your freshman strawman skills.

My point I originally made was that the post was wrong. Very much so. And here we are and it has 177 up votes for saying that the entire purpose was under 2 second payments. Ridiculous.

Agree reddit is not a great place for considerate discussion any more but upvoting a post that is flat out wrong just because it adds support to your choice of scaling option doesn't do anyone much credit. (I'm not saying you did that - just saying why I commented that OP was very wrong).

"&gt; Also why cant we make block times faster like Litecoin?... Its also 4x faster because of quicker blocks.

Not exactly. Block times are already faster on a number of coins. Monero is 2 minutes. Litecoin is 2.5 minutes. Ethereum is 15 seconds. Etc. However, with shorter block times, you have to understand that they are not as meaningful. This is why a coin like Ethereum requires so many confirmations at exchanges before the deposit is accepted. I agree that the block times could be reduced some, as Satoshi was kind of guessing when he created bitcoin, but it would require quite significant protocol changes. A better area of focus would be to make 0conf transactions safer. Within a second or two, on a large network, the risk of a double spend/fraud is only about 10%, and that is WITH the person having a bunch of dishonest miners woring for them. Dr. Peter Rizun recently gave quite an interesting speech on the topic. BCH would like to implement something called ""weakblocks"" which would allow 0conf transactions to be even safer. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXFuNkaYcPQ)

Fun fact: Before Bitcoin (BTC) implemented RBF (replace by fee), 0 conf transactions were widely accepted. Neither Shapeshift or Satoshi Dice required them. However RBF made them completely unsafe. This is why BCH removed RBF, making 0conf transactions already back to the original levels of safeness (less than check or credit card fraud).

&gt; If it leads to centralisation then why dont we change the algorithm to something ASIC resistant, like ""bitcoin gold"" did (i still have those too)? Then surely we can have bigger blocks without centralisation?

It's not about centralization, it's about censorship-resistance. All email providers are centralized, however no one owns email. ASICs are incredibly beneficial in a sense that they make it impossible to set up botnets which hijack people's browsers/servers/GPUs/etc, something people often forget.

&gt; Litecoin doesnt seem to be ""centralised"" and works just as well as bitcoin as far as I believe.

Litecoin is a testnet for bitcoin. It was first to implement segwit and plans to adopt LN once ready. There is no real benefit to the coin IMO. The founder of LTC (Charlie Lee) is best buddies with the BTC developers. He also recently sold all his LTC (at the peak, I might add). LTC is boring and undesirable to me.

&gt; Isn't lightning network kind of like admitting defeat on blockchain? Like ""oh blockchain isnt that good after all, so we're making a new system based on smart contracts, and the blockchain will just sit in the background"".

There are a number of things you should know about the Lightning Network. I will give you several links which I encourage you to go through thoroughly.

"Even if start with the premise that bitcoin is not useful to pay small amounts with, its still incredibly useful for paying larger amounts, or transfer to the other side of the world.

So even with that premise bitcoin has uses, and marktin3's analogy holds. Think about it the original statement for a second. Ver is completely misguided here. Does he *really* think that bitcoins only value is to be used as a currency to pay for your consumption?

"The BTC one was necessary because a bug in the code created billions of extra coins out of thin air. This is of course, not in the 21 million coin limit design. 

The ETH hard fork was because large investors got their funds hacked and they didn't want to continue on with the project without having their coins, so they forked to give themselves the stolen coins back. Understandable, IMO, and I have some ETH myself, but let's be fair, that is quite the definition of centralization. 

",1524772633
"Well, for starters I don't think you should get banned or that you will be, this is not the other sub where simply stating BCH is not so bad gets your post removed.

As for your points, first of all I've always heard that bigger blocks lead to centralization, however old blocks can be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree which should leave you with the same header of about 80 bytes for 1MB or 8MB blocks. Also you don't need to keep the entirety of the blocks because it is possible to verify payments without running a full network node. A user only needs to keep a copy of the block headers of the longest PoW chain, which he can get by querying network nodes until he's convinced he has the longest chain, and obtain the Merkle branch linking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in. He can't check the transaction for himself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it, and blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it. Not to mention that on a mining node storage is the cheapest resource, so really I don't see why this would affect centralization.

As for the coin being controlled that is a moot point, because BTC is also controlled by few people, the fact that BCH was able to fork successfully from it should be encouraged as a way to keep those in control honest \(Otherwise people can simply fork their project and keep working on it\). I see it as a great thing that if enough people are displeased with the way Bitcoin is being coded they can fork the network and give the middle finger to the people they disagree with, expecting Bitcoin to only be the vision and code of a handful of chosen programmers is completely against the idea of decentralization.

I agree, control is dangerous, that's why I want BCH to succeed, it would prove it's possible to fork the network if you disagree with something the devs are doing. If tomorrow BCH devs did something people disagreed with, someone could simply fork BCH and forget about the old chain, this is a good precedent, and even if you think BCH is controlled by two people who you dislike the precedent they created can be used against them if some day they decide to do something harmful to BCH.

Just out of curiosity I went to BTC github, and looked at all the PRs merged on the first page, they were all merged by 3 people, so not very far from your allegedly ""BCH is controlled by 2 pelople"" claim.",1524772628
"Sorry if this gets asked multiple times every thread, but I've been thinking about the Paypal fee increase and thinking about if crypto really does offer a viable alternative?

"Margin trading means you are basically loaning capital you don't own, and that has to come from someone. In this case you are borrowing from other traders and have to pay funding at certain time intervals. In bitmex it's every 8 hours for instance. Funding payout varies depending on a few factors, one of which is total longs vs. shorts. There were many long positions compared to shorts and so longs had to pay shorts funding.

Funding plays out in different ways depending on the duration before the payout, overall market conditions, etc. When someone sees dwindling volume, price hitting major resistance level, and such a big funding payout, it makes sense to switch to short to ride the inevitable downward movement while profiting a free .375% just for being short.

Many people don't understand this aspect of bitcoin price and it could be said that margin trading is unhealthy for bitcoin. But it could also be said that it adds volatility, which is opportunity.

As for the 'bull run'- almost everyone actively trading knows that the price spike from 6700 to 8k was entirely due to whale groups liquidating shorts. They could just as easily dump on the market at any time.",1524772576

"Oh look, my original comment was correct. You weren't here just asking questions, you're a  bcash shill with an agenda just like I said you were. Imagine that.

Big blocks are bad because they centralize nodes not mining. If you're going to make an argument at least try to understand the very basics first. If only data centers can afford to run nodes and it takes an eternity to sync the blockchain, then nobody will be able to verify their own transactions. You will then be REQUIRED to trust a 3rd party \(probably a corporation like Bitmain\) to verify them for you. That means Bcash will no longer be a trustless system and become fully centralized. Welcome to Paypal 2.0. This is Rogers end game, not money for the people. He has already gone on record and said that he would be totally OK if Bitcoin became Paypal 2.0. This goes against everything bitcoin was created for.

The only narrative trying to be pushed here is yours. There is a big difference between gradually raising the block size a little bit at a time, only as needed rather than just opening the flood gates and jumping straight into huge massive blocks and cramming every micro transaction into a bloated blockchain. The difference here is that the Core developers are actually innovating and creating ways to optimize blocks and make the blockchain as efficient as possible before having to increase the block size.  Bcash is just using the blockchain as a garbage dump thinking they can just keep increasing the blocks endlessly without repercussions.",1524772219

"It's definitely more subjective, especially since Bitcoin is decentralized and nobody owns the rights to the name. But there are a few ways of getting a good feel of which competing chain is the ""real"" one:

- PoW

- Value
  - Market cap
  - Trading volume
  - Preservation of emission schedule (otherwise market cap is unreliable indicator of value)
- Other
  - Popular recognition (by exchanges, wallets, etc.)
  - Legacy recognition (by older versions of protocol)

The chain tracked by Bitcoin Core wins out in all of the above, so I would argue it's unambiguously the ""real"" Bitcoin.

Also -- hard forks always have an uphill battle because they need to convince enough people to upgrade / switch over. Bitcoin Cash hasn't convinced enough people, hence its market value is lower.

"&gt; If BCH doesn't need it, then what's the point?
&gt; Near instant transactions and lower fees

Yes, that would be a ""need"" then.  Instant transactions and lower fees would be a plus.  This could be the sort of thing that will facilitate micro-transactions for things like paying for a movie by the minute watched, while you are watching it.  Or imagine getting paid by the minute at a job, where you clock in electronically and instead of a weekly or monthly paycheck, you are paid immediately for every 10 minutes of work until you clock out.  Lots of interesting possibilities with micro-transactions.  But like you said, it has to be nearly free to produce all those transactions.  

Hubs or centralization is a bigger problem that many realize.  It seems that every single example of the Lightning Network is done with very few players in the example so things that develop once you reach a certain size are not apparent in these examples.  

Imagine Alice wants to pay her friend Bob 20.00.  Bob is new to Lightning Network so she helps him get his channel open to her and then tells him he can now pay other on the LN as well.  The opened a bi-directional channel, funding with 20.00 each.  Now Bob has 40.00 on his end of their channel.  Alice has 0.  Life is good!  

The next day, Alice goes to her grocery store where they accept LN payments.  She has a channel with 50.00 open to the grocery.  What she doesn't realize is that Bob was so excited about using LN and since Alice mentioned this grocery store accepts LN, he went there this morning before her.  He paid the grocer 40.00 for his items which went from his end of his channel to Alice to her end of the channel (now she has 40.00 on her side of the channel with Bob).  Last step is that 40.00 from Alice's side of her channel to the grocery store shifts to the grocer's side.  This leaves 10.00 on Alice's side of the channel to the grocery store.  This is a problem when Alice tries to check out.  Even though she has 40.00 on her channel with Bob and 10.00 on her channel with the grocer (50.00 total) she is not able to pay the grocery store more than the 10.00 that sits on her side of the channel to the grocery store.  

To remedy this, she'll either have to top off her channel to the grocery store with more bitcoin from on chain (confirmation times and block chain fees apply here) or worse, she'll have to close her channel with Bob (he will discover this at some point and will probably understand this sort of thing happens) and use the money from her channel with Bob once it's back on the block chain (another on block chain transaction) to top off the channel to the grocery.  

You can probably also see how much worse this scenario would be if either Alice or Bob were to go offline.  Remember LN channels only work when both ends of a channel are online.  

Ok, so big centralized hubs can solve this issue and they can be online all the time... with hubs, most people will never open channels directly with one another because of problems like the above.  This means the hubs will be huge and once established they can set fees higher if they like.  You probably think they'd want to be competitive and you're right but imagine what a problem having bi-directional channels open to everyone will be for the hubs money.  The hub will have real money tied up in every channel they open with people.  Some people will use the channel frequently and the hub charges fees, all good.  But some people open a channel and don't use it very often.  Maybe they don't transact a lot or have other channels that get most of their traffic.  In this situation the hub is tying up their money but not getting a return for their investment in that channel.  So they will likely decide to start charging fees just to keep a channel open, but i'm speculating here.  Suffice to say, I see a real issue here an no solution addressing it.  At this scale, the hubs are basically banks 2.0.  You are transacting with a third party to pay someone.

&gt; Hubs can not steal your money.  

They actually can, but LN gives you a way to prevent this (it is your job to prevent this).  It just requires that you are always online watching your channel state.  You see, each time you transact on a channel, a new cryptographic transaction is built to replace the older one giving both participants (you and the hub) the ability to present the latest transaction (signed by both of you) to the block chain to close the channel and dispersing the money from the channel correctly.  The problem is that you could go offline, and the hub could try to process an older transaction that had more money on their end of the channel, effectively stealing money from your side of the channel.  To prevent this, your LN node will detect the transaction on the block chain and then immediately supply the last transaction details which will supersede the one they are trying to get away with.  

Ok, so you have to be online all the time to watch your channels.  Well not entirely, see the latest beta version of LND has specifications for a new thing called Watchtowers.  You can hire a watchtower (no idea what this costs) to watch your channel states.  When you are about to go offline (hopefully this will be somehow automated, since I'm expecting LN to run on my phone) you hire a watchtower and provide them with the latest transaction info so they can process your last transactions if they see your channel partner trying to process an older state to steal your money.   

Given that LN users have to choose to use a Watchtower to watch their channels when they are offline, how likely is it that people will take their chances and just not do this?  Then how often will we be hearing about people losing money to this flaw/feature?  

ugh...this is getting long so I'll stop here.  Basically, I don't see LN working.  And I didn't even get into the problems I see with them trying to create a decentralized solution and how their gossip protocol won't scale.  I honestly think they've already figured this out and that's why they are moving towards the centralized hub based solution.  It's kindof funny I guess, that the BTC crowd screams about the importance of decentralization so much when bashing bcash but are completely silent about LN becoming centralized.  ",1524770863

I thought the Andreas speech was funny just because it touched home to me in parts where A) I told people to buy BTC at $200 and they didn't. B) They bought at $16,000 when I told them not to C) My mom and others would call me when it crashed asking me if I was OK. All of those things were my real life.

"&gt; Why do you say this? Three years ago the blocks were less than 1MB, which only takes a few seconds to validate. As long as the validation takes less time to finish than 10 minutes, there is no need for any optimization. Remember, BCH nodes are not meant to run on personal computers that need to share resources with other applications. BCH nodes are supposed to be ran on specialized server hardware that only run the node software.

I don't remember the specifics, but the UI responded in a way (slowly) that made it clear that the software was only running on one or two threads. I thought to myself, this is odd, I thought this was programmed by geniuses, yet at least from the usability/responsiveness point of view, I could probably do a better job than that.

Then when I saw the video of Peter and Andrew detailing the single thread mempool handling, it confirmed my impression that the software was never really optimized, either out of laziness, or intentionally to make LN more palatable.

&gt; If you really wrote software for 20 years, you'd know that there is a cost to optimizing software. That cost is readability. If you hack up the code to make it multithreaded, you make it harder to read the code to see what is going on. In my opinion, it's better if bitcoin's code stays slow, but readable. We should let BTC be the fast and unreadable currency.

I read comments here some time ago that the code is intentionally complicated and includes artificial bottlenecks to limit its efficiency. Cleaning up that code and improving it should be possible.

Even if it is true that multi-threaded code is more complex than single-threaded code, it doesn't have to be unreadable. Clean code is a thing and there are well-known multithreaded software patterns that can help make the code understandable and maintainable.",1524769988
"Where does he say ""this is Bitcoin"" and where is BCH sold as BTC? On the website BCH is marketed as a more cost-efficient offshoot of Bitcoin; I couldn't find any evidence of him making the claim or trying to pass BCH off as BTC.

"I don't disagree with your skepticism. I too am not so sure BTC will survive in the long run for the sole reason that so many other coins will out perform it and so many coins actually have functional use cases where Bitcoin merely has its name.

"I trade in OTC markets (not crypto) so I understand perfectly well how they operate. It is an auction, and in this case the auction price is lower than the current spot market price (otherwise buyers would just buy in the spot market). Suppose the auction for 16kbtc results in an fixed price of 8000 usd per coin (it's trading around 8800usd right now). Many buyers will instantly open short positions in the spot market to lock risk-free arbitrage profits. The end result is that the spot price will fall, as expected. Venue arbitrageurs operate between markets, not only between open exchanges.

The auction doesn't move the price only if someone is in urgent need of buying 16kbtc to perfectly match the selling order. Realistically, it doesn't happen.",1524769669
ya but he would have to do it the same year.  I suppose that would be the best option do a quick sell and buy back assuming the crypto he has is one he wants to keep and it would cancel the gain.  I think there's quite a few people that made huge gains in dec though and then took a loss on it in jan.  They have to pay the gains for 2017 even though they didn't cash out if they made multiple trades and now its worth way less.  ,1524769633

"&gt;You aren't using p2p cash without validating the rules when fraud proofs don't exist.

I thought we discussed this. The idea that fraud proofs are necessary for SPV to be secure is a complete myth that comes from a misreading of the whitepaper. This misreading is obvious once you see it, yet all the key Core devs adhere it the misreading, obliviously. 

https://reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7gp6bn/gotta_say_core_dev_jorge_tim%C3%B3n_doesnt_look_good/

Fraud proofs are merely a nice to have for edge cases where miners choose a far less effective attack (publishing invalid blocks) over the much more effective 51% block withholding attack, which uses perfectly valid blocks and thus fools SPV and ""full validating nodes"" equally.",1524769360
"&gt;The **proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision

decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested
in it.** If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the
fastest and **outpace any competing chains**

"Again, if by ""nodes"" you mean the ones that can add blocks to the block chain, as is the original definition from the white paper we agree. If you mean nodes that don't have this capability, I don't see how they have much *individual* influence. If you can move almost the entire body as a collective group (especially including any non-mining nodes that have large economic influence) you may have something. But in the end, unless some of them become miners, all they are doing is throwing their support onto a fork *after the fact*.  

If MoneroV is still going to fork later, doesn't that mean someone is still running v6 for them to fork off of? So nothing's quite ""dead"" yet. All those nodes and users also have tokens on all the other forks, too. Convincing users can yet happen, and they all still have some stake in the game of each fork. If those forks start to do something, even belatedly, things can change down the road. I think it's a bit early to declare  ""Mission Accomplished"". Ultimate death would be no new blocks appearing on that fork. But even halfway death, like Bitcoin Clashic where the only exchange that trades it has virtually no volume or activity, hasn't been reached yet for any of the Monero forks. It's just too early to say for sure. I don't think all four or five will continue to exist, of course, but I'm not sure the ASIC forks are all down for good yet.",1524769304

&gt;  they came to these conclusions about 4 years before you guys did
&gt; [quoted] are we sure Dash has ""solved governance,"" or isn't it just a different model? [/quoted]
&gt; To answer this you merely need to look at Dash and compare it to the alternatives

Agree that a more centralized management team is often nimbler and more mobile.  But I would argue that the community here has rejected that very purposefully. 

&gt; It is more likely that BTC/BCH communities have overlooked the considerably improvements that have taken place in the space. BTC is like Netscape in the era of chrome. 

We don't disagree here.

&gt; more immutable
&gt; less permissioned

As it pertains to the aforementioned management model.  The network is one thing, we have seen that the human attack vector is quite problematic.

&gt; It is only healthy up to a point just like scratching an itch. You scratch an itch for 2-4 seconds, hey you're doing a good thing. Do it for 2-4 minutes and you'd be covered in blood. This infighting has WAY passed the point of usefulness.

We again don't really disagree here, I fully expect things to get ugly, but in the end I see ways in which this could be beneficial.  If Bitcoin is ultimately rendered inept, it looks to me as though that's being pushed mostly by its *competitors* which in my mind is another argument against the competitors' management structures.  

&gt; how likely it will be that the BCH team will get the problems of funding, governance, fungibility not only SOLVED and DESIGNED in BIPS, but then you hvae to get 'consensus' on it. 
&gt; Better hope those BTC trolls don't sybil-attack your shit again like on Segwit2x and a whole host of other times. AND THEN (!) you have to get it implemented in code, fully-tested and finally implemented as a hard-fork?

It's not going to be easy, sure, but as it's *competitors* introducing the majority of these problems, we're not exactly competing on the positive merit of the projects - what's happening in this space right now is, we are finding vulnerabilities.

"I think gold is a very apt analogy for Bitcoin. Its useless and clunky but was first and therefore has staying power. When paper money was invented people backed it with gold. Now paper money has been around long enough that no one keeps gold anymore because we all trust fiats. Bitcoin is clunky and doesn't work nearly as well as other coins but its been around a while(relative to the rest od crypto) and dominates the market. If Bitcoin weren't ever invented, and it was just unveiled today as it is. It wouldn't be impressive, just another shitcoin. Its already antiquated technology but is useful because people trust it more than whatever altcoin they are using for actual utility. I don't hate Bitcoin and I think that it will last quite a while simply because it already has and that is what gives it use.

As for ethereum replacing bitcoin - Ethereum is valuable because of dApps, again not for p2p transactions. This is the most revolutionary aspect of crypto in my opinion. It remains to be seen what the defacto p2p currency will be in the future. But I guarantee its not Bitcoin or ETH. ",1524769087

I don't try to protect my coins during every dip. I'm nowhere near good enough to time it right. I'd start with small trades until you get the hang of it without breaking a cold sweat. With crypto, if you mess it up today, there will be another opportunity very soon.",1524768933
"I can see a slow rise from here, then breaking through 10k after slamming our heads against it for a few days. 

I can also see a pullback to 7500-8000 range and recovery from there.

All that matters is that long term I don't see anything but prices WAY higher than today. 

For that reason, it's kinda scary but almost better if it pulls back, so I can buy more at a cheaper price. Since I'm not selling for 10 years anyways... 

It'll feel better, safer to just slowly steadily climb though.

Either way, I'm pretty sure money spent on crypto today is going to make future me really happy.",1524768892

And conditional transactions (smart contracts) with the opcodes BTC refuses to re-enable.

"As someone that’s been involved in crypto for years, the reason I hate bch is because it’s a shit coin. I don’t care about the white paper shit. How can anyone preach about a white paper and simple ignore that bigger blocks leads to centralization. Even Microsoft published info on this. 

Then toss in the shilling all over twitter and the shit that idiot scam artist lying piece of shit Roger Ver did(remember his statement on mtgox???) and I won’t ever trust anything he’s shilling.

The market and the industry has the right to decide by adoption. The market continues to chose btc not bch. Don’t you people see that with all the press that bch gets it is barely competing with doge. 

Why is that? Is it because we are all blind or because the people here ignore the facts and continue to push bs agendas? 

I’m sure I’ll get banned, but bch is a shit coin and the game of fake it till you make it won’t end well.

Crypto is about decentralization and this coin is controlled by jihan and Roger. And if it ever got any adoption it becomes a centralized coin due to bigger blocks. If I want a decentralized crap coin, I have ripple. I don’t need bch for that.

Also the fees only went up because the mempool was spammed. It pushed the agenda you people fell for. What this sub fails to notice is that if Roger and Jihan wanted bch to overtake btc they had multiple chances to do it. Back when we saw btc dipping and bch surging all they had to do was dump their 100s of thousands of btc and buy bch. THEY didn’t do it? Why is that? 

Follow the money and look at the bigger picture and you will see that bch was created for miners and by miners for profit and control. This is a threat to crypto in general. There’s a reason why the eth community doesn’t want ASICS. Control is dangerous and anyone that doesn’t see that and if you aren’t holding a crap ton of coins then you are being used as a patsy to make the rich richer and give them more control. We already have that with central banks, it’s why crypto was developed, to take away control from centralized parties and governments.",1524768771

"&gt; and I could see that the Bitcoin wallet was lacking in that aspect three years ago when I first used it.

Why do you say this? Three years ago the blocks were less than 1MB, which only takes a few seconds to validate. As long as the validation takes less time to finish than 10 minutes, there is no need for any optimization. Remember, BCH nodes are not meant to run on personal computers that need to share resources with other applications. BCH nodes are supposed to be ran on specialized server hardware that only run the node software.

&gt;  so why not do it?

If you really wrote software for 20 years, you'd know that there is a cost to optimizing software. That cost is readability. If you hack up the code to make it multithreaded, you make it harder to read the code to see what is going on. In my opinion, it's better if bitcoin's code stays slow, but readable. We should let BTC be the fast and undreadable currency.",1524768587

That cannot be construed to be anything other than lies, propaganda and fraud.

If you disagree, *you* are part of the poison on this community. BCH hardforked, becoming a **alt-coin** the moment it decided to step away from bitcoins consensus model.

Thats fine, anyone is welcome to do that, but you cannot fork the bitcoin repo with 1% of the economy and then claim ""overwhelming consensus"".

"The fundamental limit is 1MB of transactions. This limit was preserved by Segwit, the result was just a marginal increase in transaction capacity. To date approximately a 20% transaction capacity increase.

The competing proposal for a capacity increase was coded and tested, it requires no additional adoption just a coordinated and agreed update date. (it's done now the upgrade is defined as Bitcoin BCH) 

It allowed an 800% capacity increase.

"no one, nodes are extremely lightweight and easy to run. the ecosystem has an incentive to maintain itself because of the advantages of no fees and instant transactions. PoW and dPoS are entirely different. in PoW miners validate the network by running full nodes, they're rewarded with fees/block reward. in dPoS you designate a representative to vote on your behalf, that representative's voting weight is based on the amount of Nano he has staked. so representatives are the miners in this context. you also have secondary individuals that run nodes to decentralize and secure the network without incentives, just like with the bitcoin network. people run nodes just in good faith to secure the network. 

Nano nodes are also super efficient, you can pretty much bootstrap the entire blockchain in hours as opposed to days with bitcoin. Wallets also act as nodes, so if you have a wallet you're essentially a node to the network. Also businesses will have to run nodes in order to validate transactions, their incentive is that transactions will be free for them. That's a powerful financial incentive. 

However, devs are working on to further incentive the ecosystem. So far the current system works but the devs are working to better it. ",1524767941

The whitepaper itself talks about the costs of mediation and how they increase the cost of transactions and proposes a solution, so it's implied that Bitcoin should be cheap, as for fast I think it's common sense that if something is to be used as money it should be fast.

In other words, even if the entire point of Bitcoin is not to be cheap and fast this are attributes that we expect from all useful payment systems, so for Bitcoin to be meaningful it should have those properties too \(as well as others such as durability, portability, divisibility, uniformity, limited supply, and acceptability\).

"Yes.  But let me clarify.  It has to do it in a decentralized manner.

1.  LN has to be able to find a payment path through its network without centralizing into large hubs controlled by large companies (this is where they are headed as it's the only way to solve their problem).  FYI - I've been a network engineer since before the world wide web was added to the Internet.  I've seen some shit.  I've read through the LN papers starting with the first whitepaper by Joseph Poon and then read through publishings from BitFury on LN routing and Rusty Russell (Blockstream) on how all the proposed routing (payment path finding) solutions won't scale.  Today it works by broadcasting channel states to every single LN node (broadcasting to every node?!  Networking guys like myself cringe at this).  This is so broken only huge centralized hubs can make it work.  

2.  If LN works with a decentralized solution and BCH reaches a point where it needs to scale beyond what it can handle on chain, then absolutely add LN to BCH.  If BCH doesn't need it, then what's the point?  

Another possibility in this unlikely scenario would be that BCH is scaling just fine with other methods but LN works really well for micro transactions or something other specific use case, then again, I'd like to see LN added to BCH.  Add in all the things that work!  

Full disclosure - I also hold BTC because I bought it a year ago and its stayed positive even through the dips since then.

PS - if you are holding BTC, I'd keep holding it.  However, until we see what LN will do about payment path finding, I would not put anymore into BTC.  ",1524766496
"I pretty much agree with the majority of your statement. Nobody is selling Bcash, just making fun of it.

That is what Bitcoin Cash is doing when they sell themselves as Bitcoin. Fortunately, nobody is actually guilty of this yet (the actual selling), but if any exchange were to label BCH as BTC and sell it, they would definitely risk going to jail. We should all agree that marketing Bitcoin Cash as Bitcoin is unethical, but caveat emptor applies and the only one who would go to jail would be those who actually do sell it.

"Hear me out. Upfront, I'm going to tell you straight up that I'm taking this opportunity to shill you Kin.

I agree completely with you. Steem sucks. Synereo sucks. Mithril sucks. appcoins suck.

Kin is a new monetization model that aligns the incentives of the developers with their users. Nobody likes ads, so instead, developers are incentivized to build better apps with more valuable services that engage and retain users, and encourage them to earn and spend Kin within their app. The more transaction volume they can generate, the more reward the developers get from the daily payout from the Kin Rewards Engine. It's starting with Kik this Q2, and on day 1 it will be the most used cryptocurrency in the world *by far*.

There are about 6 million active crypto users, Kik *alone* has 15 million monthly active users. Kin will be used in an ecosystem of apps, banding developers together to compete against the monopolies like facebook and google. They ran an experiment with Kik Points for 2 and a half years, and they did 3-10x the global transaction volume of bitcoin, and their users could only buy *stickers*. With Kin, you'll be able to earn Kin in your Unity-based mobile game, and then turn around and buy something on Steam. Or Best Buy. Or Netflix. or 270 others. They're partnered with Blackhawk, so every app developer has access to exclusive discounts on major brands for their users.

Kin allows everyone the equal opportunity to get paid for their contributions. Seriously, if all these appcoins are annoying to you, Kin is the solution. Look into it. It's going to be the most-used crypto in the world. Hands down. As a bonus, Fred Wilson is a venture capitalist on the board of directors for Kik and Coinbase. He's meeting with SEC regulators to ""safe-harbor"" certain coins as utilities instead of securities. When this happens, Kin is going to be one of the very few coins that get labeled as securities, and don't be surprised when Coinbase wants an okayed utility coin by the SEC on their exchange, especially considering Kin's transaction volume is going to dwarf the top 10 combined.",1524766212

It's not like Bitcoin Cash has lots of options left. Most roads lead to peril:

- Lightning is abandoned but BTC implements bigger blocks = death of BCH. Everyone is using BTC, 1 sat/byte gets confirmed in next block.

- Lightning works and BTC implements bigger blocks = death of BCH. Everyone is using BTC, 1 sat/byte gets confirmed in next block. Lightning is used for micropayments and gig economy workers who get paid instantly by the second.

- Lightning works but BTC keeps small blocks = death of BCH. Everyone is using Lightning, only big banks use BTC on-chain tx with $100-$1000 fees.

- BTC is banned or heavily taxed = death of BCH. Because if BTC goes down, it takes everything with it.

- Lightning is abandoned and BTC keeps small blocks = a narrow chance of BCH surviving.

So placing all BCH's bets on two unlikely things (LN failing and BTC keeping small blocks) seems like a very bad choice.

If an invalid block is mined, that block would be rejected by the peers that the SPV wallet is connected to.  The SPV would not see a confirmation.

If one of the peers decided to accept the invalid block anyways, it may show up as a confirmation briefly, but it would be undone when the valid chain overtook the invalid chain.  You could certainly see that.

In any case, this portion of the argument is moot because invalid blocks are practically never mined.  Miners are disincentiveized to mine invalid blocks.

"Experienced programmers know that any implementation on any platform will always have a limit: if it is not explicit in the program itself, it will be imposed by the operating system, the internet connection, the hardware's memory, etc.

Satoshi's original implementation did not have an explicit limit, but at some pint it was found that there was a 32 MB limit imposed by some internet message handling library.   The XT implementation of Bitcoin Cash claimed to implement BIP100, that let miners vote on the limit; but it turned out that it had a ""block size limit lmit"", that was not in BIP100, that prevented the limit to be raised above 32 MB.

Having a ""non-official"" block size limit is a bug, because the value may be different for different implementttaions and platforms. Suppose that the limit is 16 MB for 40% of the miners, but 32 MB for the other 60%.  If a miner, by accident or malice, creates a 20 MB block, the coin would split: the majority 32 Mb miners woul accept it and mine a branch of the chain on top of it, while the minority 16 MB miners would reject it and build their own branch of the chain, with all blocks less than 16 MB.

The solution to that bug is to have an explicit block size limit in the protocol itself, valid for all implementation on all platforms.  It should be as large as possible, but not so large that it would require extraordinary resources or changes to basic libraries and OS.   

Satoshi put the 1 MB limit about 18 months after the initial release, when the largest block size seen until that date was less than 10 kB.  He never explained why; but, as far as I can see, the only possible reason was to avoid the above risk.  Indeed, when Jeff Garzik complained and posted a patch to raise that limit, Satoshi promptly rebuked him, warning that it would cause a coin split.

Satoshi then explained how the limit could be safely raised ""when we came close to needing it"".  Raising the limit was supposed to be a routine maintenance action, that users would not even have to know about, as long as they kept their software minimally up-to-date.  In fact, users were not even supposed to be aware that there *was* a block size limit.

But then a bearded ""expert"" came along, and claimed that the block size limit was not only an essential feature of the design, but was meant to actually constrain the traffic; so that the network would be permanenly (and artificially ) congested.  And,moreover, that 1 MB was a sacred number that should never, absolutely never, be changed...

IN conclusion: yes, there must be an explicit block size limit. No, it cannot be variable, because then there would have to be a ""block size limit limit"" -- then it would be stupid to set a limit artificially below that ""limit limit"".  No, changing the limit from time to time is not big deal, and it should be MUCH larger than the actual block sizes. 

And no one should be concerned about the block size limit except the actual software developers.  Non-programming ""gurus"", especially, should not have opinions about that obscure technical detail.",1524765243

I'm not alone... as a matter of fact, the majority was listened to, the majority wanted scaling off chain.

"&gt;For the third time, 1MB blocks, SegWit and RBF do not lead to a system that is more resistant to attack from outside forces

This is your conclusion, but not a justification or it. 2 of these are policies geared at keeping the network small and *aggressively* decentralized in it's validation, which is absolutely an asset in resisting attack from outside forces, even if they impede the growth of the thing that would be attacked.

&gt; maybe you should entertain the idea that perhaps a larger block size within current levels is not a threat to decentralization.

I'm not being as critical of BCH and supporters as you're suggesting (I consider myself one, at least in part), and in my opinion BTC is indeed erring too far on the side of conservatism with regard to block size. Not having at least modest exponential growth solidly on the roadmap with target dates at this point is a bad plan. There is surely a ""sweet spot"" for higher resource demand reducing node count but higher capacity bringing in more users and increasing it that BTC is missing.

But my argument is that the target path for open ended, pie in the sky on chain growth with the expectation that full nodes will end up as $6-7 figure equipment misses that sweet spot too. When the entire user base relies on SPV and both mining and validation ends up in the hands of a relative few, the network *absolutely* gets easier to directly pressure from outside forces, or even from incentive misalignment between those validators and the broader user base.

Is ""easier"" dangerously easy? Ehhhhh, maybe not. Maybe still quite censorship resistant, with an immutable monetary policy. But a rational person could still come to the conclusion is is, and that erring on the side of conservatism to retain those properties as strongly as possible, even at the expense of some usability is worth it.

&gt;also the smear campaign that has been going on against those who seek to pursue the original idea to its ultimate consequences

The tribal goobs still running around shouting ""bcash"" and making ad hominem attacks about the project instead of *really* understanding why they support the coin they do are indeed the worst. The best we can both do is engage with level headed discussion and debate when possible, and down vote/ignore when it isn't.",1524765024
"&gt; Yeah old nodes are cheated into following a node they cannot fully audit anymore.

&gt; (Such upgrade allow to break consensus while leaving node powerless against the change)

Old nodes can continue to operate as usual. If they want to use non-segwit tx they can do so.

&gt; SF can lead to split just like HF, that’s the simple truth.

lol xD my oatmeal breakfast now causes hardforks too

&gt; So what is the purpose of segwit and 1MB4EVER?

eer what? Segwit fixes malleability so make LN possible in a secure way, and 1) segwit increased blocksize and 2) no one has said blocksize should *never* be increased.

&gt; Certainly not, returning to the fundamentals was the whole purpose of BCH.

the DAA you got is a departure from the fundamentals. That *actually* changes the incentives on the network as miners have no power as to what protocol changes are implemented, as the DAA will always ensure that blocks are generated. Do you understand?

&gt; The DAA actually make a better at controlling the coin emission than the BTC one.. (BTC goes too fast, you can check on fork.lol)

How can you miss my point so entirely? It has nothing to do with coin emission - it has to do with bcash' vision of miners being the important players on the network. Now, with the DAA hashpower has no say on the network with regard to protocol. Bitcoin ABC you implement a ""fuck miners patch"" and have economic nodes and other important non-mining nodes implement it and miners could do nothing to prevent it. Blocks would be generated, with or without majority of hashpower.

&gt; Somehow the 21 million limit is the only bitcoin characteristics?

There are some other more ""fluffy"" characteristics as being able to audit the whole chain youself (bcash doesn't really care about this), and that the whole system is secure, but other than that I'd say whatever the community wants. If it turns out DAG is superior to a blockchain I'd have no problem doing that for example.

&gt; Technically block are still 1MB, patched with extra data.

Technically they are not. They are larger than 1 mb all blocks now. But if you only have an old old node you only get the tx data without witness data.

&gt; What a ridiculous statement.

As I said, you need some authority to tell you what bitcoin should be. Think for yourself.

urgency about blocksize became known. **E.N.D.L.E.S.S.** hours and days and volumes of posts of autistic screeching follow FOR FOUR YEARS. NOTHING IS DONE. 4 years is wasted.

Meanwhile in Dash:

Sees BTC blocksize issue which will affect all crypto eventually, and is currently tearing btc apart,VOTES TO RAISE BLOCKSIZE when necessary after merely 24 hours. 24 hours &lt;&lt; 4 years. So I guess my question to you would be, what do you think?

&gt;more open to competition

In what way? Dash routinely takes on improvements to BTC core that do not conflict with their vision. They reject the bad ones though like RBF and Segwit. Oh they came to these conclusions about 4 years before you guys did. I'm just saying why are you guys not betting on the horse that came to the same conclusions as you but much earlier? That's all.

&gt;more immutable

How so? The hashing algorithms (and thus the difficulty) of individual networks cannot be directly compared.

&gt; less permissioned

That is clearly false. Coins can and have been blacklisted. But with Dash, its not possible to know which coins to blacklist if you use privateSend. BCH/BTC has NO protocol-level recourse for its users to create fungibility, thus leaving them open to censorship. That would make BCH less permissioned than Dash.

&gt; I actually think the infighting is a healthy sign

It is only healthy up to a point just like scratching an itch. You scratch an itch for 2-4 seconds, hey you're doing a good thing. Do it for 2-4 minutes and you'd be covered in blood. This infighting has WAY passed the point of usefulness. Remember all that Dash has accomplished in the last 4 years, THEN REMEMBER that you have to accomplish the same thing in a much faster time in order to be relevant.

 But not only that, you have to do it YOUR OWN WAY because otherwise you're just going to be admitting that Dash was right all along. Honestly, ask yourself how likely it will be that the BCH team will get the problems of funding, governance, fungibility not only SOLVED and DESIGNED in BIPS, but THEN implemented in code, fully-tested and finally implemented as a hard-fork?  Let's forget about while maintaining satoshi's original vision (coinjoin was not satoshis original vision because of the trust required), your solution(s!) not only have to be fast, they not only have to work, BUT THEY HAVE TO WORK BETTER than Dash's since Dash is the first-mover technologically in the cryptospace.

Increasing block size as a long term scaling solution is just as silly as thinking the lightning network is a long term scaling solution.

Ok, so Lightning Network is awesome and will take years... but Stellar Lumens is touting it as already working on both Bitcoin and Litecoin, and saying they will have it working by the end of the year.  This should send your bullshit flag to the top of the pole. 

All that said, I don't believe Lightning Network will ever solve its payment path finding issue without being centralized.  As long as they claim Lightning Network remains decentralized and will solve the routing issue, they are either lying or deluding themselves.  

What we do see happening with the latest beta release of LND (Lightning Network Daemon) is that they are moving towards a centralized topology with the addition of hubs.  They just quietly stopped talking about decentralization like that's no big deal.

Language evolves, new words are created and old words die away. It's old hat to use the term old hat and words like HODL form over some guy making a spelling error. I google words even though I use duckduckgo and just this morning my child and I were playing with a 'car' that was really a hoola hoop.
If I go to Australia they say ""theudeen"" instead of ""thirteen"" and are 'keen' instead of 'interested' like us North Americans. My wife is convinced a cabin is by the lake and I vehemently argue that's called a cottage. Language is quite beautiful because there is no 99.999% concensus despite your belief that somehow 99.999% of people believe that bitcoin is btc.

...sigh....

You see, language can differ by city, by region, by language, by dialect. So what is a Bitcoin? It really doesn't matter, to you it's apparently a currency that doesn't currently scale without a second layer solution (which could be years away). To some it's a currency that can be used by someone making 2$ a day in Africa (the 'unbanked'). To others it's a ponzi scheme, to others the greatest threat to all manking. To some it represents the entire crypto sphere including ICOs. 

To me? It is an idea with a whitepaper, with different implementations (chains) - and whatever people want to call it is up to them, there is no ownership to the word, just like there is no ownership to the word ""car"". I would argue that BCH is currently the currency which most closely resembles the idea in its implementation - but I'm not a cult follower of one or the other. Both chains might thrive, both chains might die, but I am a firm believer that bitcoin will live on. 

The BCH community is far from small, it isn't just one guy like Roger Ver - it's a big community, with many who were original bitcoin developers who feel that BTC has been taken over by Blockstream who would have the most to gain by taking transactions off chain. 
Furthermore - there are many many, myself included, who feel they are a part of both communities and think it's silly that one must be in one or the other. This is tantamount to politics where one doesn't have to be ""right wing"" or ""left wing"" 100% of the time, they can agree with parts of one platform, and other parts from the other - and in some cases agree with neither. 

If you want to foster conversation, start by calling BCH ""Bitcoin Cash"" instead of ""shitcoin"" ""altcoin"" ""nocoin"" ""bcash"" which is what it's aptly named in r/bitcoin. I will happily begin to agree with you more if the BCH community begins calling BTC BCore and starts trying to sue the owners of bitcoin.org for ""fraud""

It really is best to face the pain now and get people implementing ways to use blockspace as efficiently as possible rather than continuing to encourage people to build unsustainable business models that use blockspace inefficiently.

Moreover, given that the explanation was extremely vague, had no renewed time table, no statement as to whether they’d ever be released, and no option to just wait it out, I have question whether they ever intended this release. 

Given they made the announcement about a week after Bitmain announced the X3 and listed theirs at a price significantly lower than The exorbitantly priced X3 and an earlier release date it seems like they they sought to screw Bitmain and possibly figured they’d just sit on the coin, wait for BTC to surge (it was very low when they announced so downside was reasonably minimal) and then just announce a production delay and issue refunds and keep everyone’s excess coin.

Instead of perpetuating the idea that BCH supporters are illiterate hoards who want free transactions forever without caring about censorship resistance and immutability, maybe you should entertain the idea that perhaps a larger block size within current levels is not a threat to decentralization.

"&amp;gt; Segwit is only a soft fork because the consensus breaking data is hidden to old nodes.
&amp;gt; Segwit do break consensus rule, otherwise how come block bigger than 1MB get mined ?

&gt;Im starting to think you dont know how forks work now. The segwit part of the data is, as you know, hidden for old nodes and can never be held up against old concensus rules. 

Yeah old nodes are cheated into following a node they cannot fully audit anymore.

This is an hack and a very dangerous slippery slope.

(Such upgrade allow to break consensus while leaving node powerless against the change)

&gt;&amp;gt; This is not quite true, SF can lead to currency split (ex: segwit led to BCH splitting) and HF don’t always lead to two chains.

&gt;You are really starting to stretch your credibility here. Codewise a softfork does not cause chainsplits.  

Neither HF.

&gt;Sure, people can fork, but then its not the softfork that causes the split, its some other peoples code. I can just as well claim that me eating oatmeal for breakfast causes chain splits, because if I eat oatmeal I get a sudden urge to change concensus rules.

SF can lead to split just like HF, that’s the simple truth.

An contentious soft fork has been pushed on the network, making a split unavoidable.

&gt;&amp;gt; Yet this chain is a complete change of fundamentals and incentives.

&gt;No.

So what is the purpose of segwit and 1MB4EVER?

&gt;&amp;gt; It is arguably the bitcoin fork that departe the most from Bitcoin original experiment.


&gt;No, bcash is. 

Certainly not, returning to the fundamentals was the whole purpose of BCH.

&gt;The DAA removes miners power to direct what code should be run, as blocks will always be generated rwgardless of hashpower. 

What are you talking about?

The DAA actually make a better at controlling the coin emission than the BTC one.. (BTC goes too fast, you can check on fork.lol)

&gt;And I dont even agree that ""departing from the original experiment"" is a valid argument, as you can change anything in bitcoin you want to, as long as you have concensus. Maybe not the 21 mil limit I think we can all agree on at least that.

Somehow the 21 million limit is the only bitcoin characteristics?

Pushing a sofk fork that would only allow empty block would be ok? Consensus is kept, Bitcoin is broken.. ok by you?

&gt;&amp;gt; Maybe you can quote the white paper where the 1MB is described as a permanent economic feature, where the weight limit is discribe, where the segregated witness is explain, where the concept of settlement layer and fee market is explained?

&gt;We have larger than 1 mb blocks, so your even wrong about that, 

Technically block are still 1MB, patched with extra data.

To cheat old nodes.

&gt;and second the purpose of the whitepaper is not some sort of blueprint that describes how bitcoin must be.

I agree, and 21 million limit seems to be the only feature you recognize from it.

(Funny enough the 21 million don’t even exist in the white paper actually, nor in the code)

&gt;You treat a whitepaper as some sort of religious gospel. It seems to me that you do this because you need some kind of authority to guide you.

What a ridiculous statement.

The white paper discribe the currency and the project.

The core dev captures the project and changed its goal and incentives, it is natural we refer to it to show the changes made.

Departure from it **should** only be done via HF, because departure for it should only be possible if there is consensus, doing so via soft give way too much power to miner and dev. SF are coercive, using them to change the currency make bitcoin no difference than a centrally planned currency.. (node are powerless to SF.. as they see  the rule change made)",1524762490

When you say
&gt; There isn't a whole lot of new money flowing into crypto right now, and google trends interest is flat or declining on just about every timeframe. 

in my opinion, you are absolutely right.

&gt; To me, that's a warning sign that the market could drop significantly if even a few people leave, because there's not many buyers waiting to jump in.

Let me add some gasoline to that fire. 

I have been monitoring the Margin funding market at Bitfinex, and one thing I noticed, is that this last bull run from 6,8K to 9,7k, was mostly funded by margin funds. If money was borrowed, money has to be returned... with interests.

&gt; For those of you who bought bitcoin when it was under 1000, you probably don't need to worry. 

Honestly, early adopters with large amount of coins have most likely cashed out long ago, with an awesome profit. Who can blame them...

In order for the market to rise once again above the 20K, an incredible amount of cash needs to flow into the market. Now, will it all go into Bitcoin? That's not what the charts are showing...

In this last bull run, Bitcoin Cash was able to double its value. The same applies to Bitcoin Gold. Insane!

"A big one is, I have less faith in Dash's origins.  There was some strange stuff involved there.  At least two rebrands that I am aware of, *not that there's anything wrong with that*, it's just not Bitcoin.  And are we sure Dash has ""solved governance,"" or isn't it just a different model?  Bitcoin seems to me more open to competition, more immutable, less permissioned, I actually think the infighting is a healthy sign, it mimics nature, and may result in a better end product.  I also believe Dash is much more purchasable, that's just my personal opinion.  No real offense against Dash intended, I really like some aspects of Dash.  I'd actually love for Amanda to talk to me about Dash, anytime.  In fact, Dash may be innovative and even incredibly useful.  But, I think Bitcoin is the organic community of world changers, does not lack utility at all, and does not require marketing to win my vote.

"BTC should be a store of value, like gold. Basing it's worth on its practicality is silly. There are bajillions of other projects that all do p2p transactions extremely fast and will actually be able to scale. Unless there is some radical change to bitcoin's blockchain structure it won't scale easily and every so often there will need to be a fork or an update to keep it manageable. To me this ruins the decentralization of it. Hold Bitcoin because Bitcoin has name recognition and is a pretty solid representation of the market as a whole. Don't expect Bitcoin to be the practical crypto of the future. I predict that Bitcoin will be pretty much exclusively used in the future as a store of value for big organizations who use other currencies to transact and operate but do not hold them because of potential volitility.

"The fundamental problem is the tragedy of the commons. The pool approach just shunts the problem onto a second layer. It is unlikely to solve the fundamental problem yet it is likely to be an massive single point of capture. High risk, low gain.

I prefer to let unsolved problems remain that way until we find a real solution. Let's not be like LN which depends on a future solution to a fundamental problem (routing) to be viable. Keep Bitcoin simple.

I have a feeling that Bitcoin is going to enable some meaningful solutions to the tragedy of the commons. Then we can come back around to this. In the meantime, the only realistic solution I see is miners directly fund devs.

"&gt; But my point was that Bitcoin could be a digital store of value and not be used so much in everyday life, just like gold, and it would also have scarcity like gold does.

Yes, that is perfectly valid. But I wonder how the market will react once Bitcoin start's to become more scarce. Will the market simply turn its attention to other cryptos? It is very plausible in my opinion.

It is also plausible that the crypto market could entirely collapse and we are just in the biggest bubble in the human history.

Either way, it will be awesome to to able to watch it in person.",1524761620
"&gt; Yes you said you weren't concerned either way in this particular case, but if it had been a time critical transaction, are you admitting you would've sent it with a far higher fee (even though the mempool appeared clear at the time?) Wouldn't it be better to have a system that is far more reliable at all times even at far lower fee levels? I guess you must at least partially agree as you mentioned you would support a moderate block size limit increase.

To be clear, I am not a novice user - I sent this tx using Bitcoin Core, manually set the fee in sat/b, and checked the mempool before doing so. I *knew* the mempool was congested when I sent the transaction, and I was ok with waiting days, weeks, or even re-sending if necessary.

&gt;Moreover, even if it does come to pass, only mining nodes, businesses, and die-hard hobbyists need be concerned. So it may at some point in the distant future, take months for those in these groups to become a full decentralized node on what will by then be a major global economic network. Meanwhile, for everyday users of (white paper) Bitcoin, the user experience will continue to be just fine. Those highly incentivized or motivated to sync a full-node are still free to do so, and would likely gladly accept the time inconvenience to become their own decentralized participant in what would be a far more valuable and powerful global network by that time in the future.

This is what I disagree with. In Bitcoin, running a node is your ""vote."" I just bootstrapped my node that hadn't been updated since 2011 in 24 hours. The larger you make the blockchain, the less ""votes"" you have in the system, and the more say powerusers, miners, and ""whales"" that can afford the computing requirements have. Right now, you can run a full node on a laptop with an external hard drive.  I and others think it's important to keep it that way. Although I do think it's important to try to find a middle ground between scaling and decentralization. ",1524761619
"Yes to solve the same throughput as BTC, BCH will require 8X less miners if they both had the same volume.

 - How active is their reddit? Is it just lambo/moon memes or actual tech/application discussion?
 - How ""shilled"" is it? This can be both good or bad. Is it mentioned a lot on reddit on by youtubers? Do those youtubers have credibility? For example: Cryptolark = credibility. JR Business = scam.

They then put in lots of buy orders on Bitfinex at 60% of current Mkt price. Then sold heavily - with a mkt order, flashcrashing the mkts in several coins.

They then swept these up with their discounted buy orders.. and are already 40% in profit from these -- as the price rebounded straight away.

And the Mt. Gox move today, was bought by them on a Dark pool.

Except it doesn't work like that. Margin requirements for holding bitcoin futures short are significantly higher than margin requirements for holding the same futures long, but the cost of shorting actual bitcoins is significantly higher than going long bitcoins. 

On an overall basis, this means that futures will exhibit a downward price pressure on futures, and an upward pressure on the underlying (not including expectations of the future. The way we confirm this is by discounting time value from bitcoin contracts, and seeing if the price of contracts at the same strike are worth the same, then, we track movement of the underlying, and movement of the contract, to see if they are the same historically. Any divergance, above or below, would reveal an upward or downward bias to futures contracts, at least for that period.

Yes I'm naive in assuming there is a direct linear correlation between block size increase and centralisation growth. I don't know the maths off the top of my head and we can't know until it's ran on testnet for BCH but as adoption increases for BCH and block sizes may increase (I remember Roger Ver saying this is the easy solution; this is very wrong) the ratio between repeat blocks for a single miner are increased which actually increases the centralisation even more because there are less blocks(due to the increase block size)


You make the point of not everyone having an email server, and that not everyone needs to run a node; if what you explain would not be a problem then centralisation is imminent.


The point of Bitcoin is to get as many people solving transaction to spread the points of failures.


At the end of the day I strongly implore people to be of favour of decentralisation rather than the short term benefits of lower tx costs and faster tx speeds.


Without decentralisation, VISA trumps, AliPay destroys, Banks win.

"Thanks for the link. And sorry about the following wall 'o text. My response got out of hand, feel free to ignore it if you like.  

But I must point out, you don't know that you weren't lucky. That's the thing with stochastic processes. As I explained, in this specific episode, instead of waiting only two hours, you may have been stuck until all the congestion resolved, which may have been many more hours. In fact, that link I provided you already documented a user that was clearly not as lucky as you were. Yes you said you weren't concerned either way in this particular case, but if it had been a time critical transaction, are you admitting you would've sent it with a far higher fee (even though the mempool *appeared* clear at the time?) Wouldn't it be better to have a system that is far more reliable at *all times* even at far lower fee levels? I guess you must at least partially agree as you mentioned you would support a moderate block size limit increase.  

I can't speak for everyone in the on-chain scaling contingent, but I and many others do acknowledge the *theory* that raising the block size limit may cause issues down the road. But this theory has never been proven, and may never turn out to be true. Even if it eventually does, there are built-in market feedback structures to allow the system to continue operating. That's when a *truly natural fee market would develop*.  

Personally, I recognize that (white paper) Bitcoin has always been a revolutionary, *good enough* system, but it's never been one that solved the Byzantine General's problem with mathematical completeness. It's full of compromises and clever incentive structuring to make the system *just work*. It's never been about absolute decentralization for decentralization's sake, nor achieving the last possible iota of censorship resistance. These are the aspects that made people like Greg Maxwell think the system wouldn't even work from day one, and continues to be the reason they are mutilating a working system based on their own false perceptions and assumptions. White paper Bitcoin is ""A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"" first and foremost. It does also have beneficial decentralization and censorship traits that are important, but never at the expense of its original design intent. Don't kill the working system for fear that the experiment *might* encounter problems (for which it already has built-in compensatory incentives) at some indefinite time in the future. You can and should proactively optimize and improve the system against such hypotheticals while it continues to operate and grow.  

As a final note, your supposing that it will take months to download the block chain is full of unknowns, and hypothetical assumptions of your own (one such example is that growth of average block sizes would outpace technological innovation and design optimizations / design improvements). Moreover, even if it does come to pass, only mining nodes, businesses, and die-hard hobbyists need be concerned. So it *may* at some point in the distant future, take months for those in these groups to become a full decentralized node on what will by then be a major global economic network. Meanwhile, for everyday users of (white paper) Bitcoin, the user experience will continue to be just fine. Those highly incentivized or motivated to sync a full-node are still free to do so, and would likely gladly accept the time inconvenience to become their own decentralized participant in what would be a far more valuable and powerful global network by that time in the future.  

[And if we're going to make massive assumptions about how things might be in the indefinite future, I would guess that should syncing a new node over the standard network ever take two months, there will be untold optimizations and bootstrap workarounds for those motivated to get synced up sooner. We can already see those today in the past usage of bootstrap.dat files and in the purpose-built networks miners use to transmit and receive blocks like Falcon and FIBRE. These will also only be massively improved in the future, and new methods and optimizations will be available as well.]",1524760830

"That's true, and it also seems to me nothing Satoshi wrote indicated how Nakamoto consensus applies when there is more than one competing ruleset each with strong market support. 

It has therefore fallen to us to figure out the dynamics of how investors and miners interact to govern splits and satisfy the desires of all stakeholders:

- First came Daniel Krawisz's article [Who Controls Bitcoin?](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/who-controls-bitcoin/), which established the initial principle that investment is how matters in Bitcoin are ultimately decided

Subsequently:

- Peter Rizun formalized and explored technically the idea of [spinoffs](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=563972.0) as ledger-preserving rule changes that could peacefully coexists without diluting Bitcoin investor holdings, thus preserving store of value even under experiment. These are now called majority/minority chain splits or sometimes ""airdrops"" if they seem less serious.

- I published a series called [Forkology](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/3skbkz/forkology_101_the_source_of_the_sanctity_of_the/) where I examined deeper implications of the beneficial things the chain-splitting process allows in terms of market arbitrage, expanded to imagining how it could play out [if all technical constraints were overcome](https://bitco.in/forum/threads/easy-resolution-to-the-debate-using-spinoffs.649/) (and further [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/3y34mv/bitcoin_is_the_protocol_and_blockchain_not/cyai3k1)).

- Elliot Olds put together many of the ideas around this into his [Market Goverance FAQ](https://bitcoindebates.miraheze.org/wiki/Market_Governance_FAQ), where he also covers Core's objections with an eye toward resolving the two paradigms.

- Antony Zegers wrote a [pair of articles](https://medium.com/@Mengerian/two-lenses-f3a6d7962da6) going into further detail on the two paradigms.

- Since then I and others have continued developing the dynamics of chain splits or ""forks"" (which I now think is a term that should be limited to what a software repo does), hashpower voting, and ledger economics, with an increasing focus on and appreciation of mining incentives and how they create a robust system on several unexpected levels. Since I have written these in a rather disorganized and continually evolving fashion, there are too many disparate comments and posts  to link, but many can be found by digging through my comment history and gildeds. I touch on the subject and related matters frequently, bringing I hope a new level of clarity each time.",1524760250

Even though the futures mkt has more considerations such as -- mainly with BTC futures -- the carry cost, as there are no dividends... and mkt sentiment plays which do not directly impact the underlying price + time....

"Short term fix for a long term problem.

Fully respect the devs behind BCH as with any dev, not so much the fan base (surprisingly I don't mind Roger, he makes decent points here and there)


Bigger blocks means miners will compete to get a block 8X bigger meaning there will be less blocks mined.


This results the person with the biggest hash power to be able to solve 8X more transactions making the whole system 8x more centralised.


This will only get worse as BCH adoption grows, yes the fees are kept nice and small and transaction speeds are nice and fast but at what cost?


Why are we aiming to dethrone the bankers? Too much centralisation and fucking over the small guy. Bigger blocks goes against satoshi vision of decentralisation (yes I know in the white paper he mentioned to increase block size if needed but just because he created it does not make him a god, he can't envision the problems in the future)



Does this make BCH a shit coin? Absolutely not, they're simply taking a different take on the task at hand. Solve the problem at hand of big fees and slow tx times in the meantime and they'll still be able to add layer 2 solutions that help with the centralisation problem in the future.


Does sticking at 1mb block size make Bitcoin a shit coin? Absolutely not, they're looking to keep the decentralisation at bay (in my opinion this is more important, in all of financial history , decentralised financial systems are new so there's no rush to get it in the hands of everyone; especially if it's not ready, fast payments and low tx fees have been around for years so that's why I'm personally more in favour of BTC take on things)




To summarise, I encourage everyone to think about Bitcoin and the fork Bitcoin Cash as simply two different takes at completing the same final goal. Economic freedom.



As a side not: I don't like the way BCH is marketing itself at all, as others have argued above, consensus dictates what is the original and what is the side-fork in the example of ETC and ETH, ethereum won over consensus and therefore took the name Ethereum whereas the original lost the consensus and was renamed to Ethereum Classic.

I don't think it's right to call the coin bcash as this is a disservice to the developers imo. But then again this may be the cost of misleading people through naming, @bitcoin, r/btc (there is literally no argument for this, the ticker btc has nothing to do with the coin bch), Bitcoin.com and now this where they refer to Bitcoin as BCH and Bitcoin Core as BTC.


I think both sides are at fault in some ways, just look at the code and you'll realise both are doing interesting things with different ways to tackle the challenges.

"As long as you need to say ""coincidentally"" even if it is with a sarcastic tone, you can't really call it a _grand_ conspiracy. A conspiracy to implement LN or to change Bitcoin into something the design is not, maybe, but grand I wouldn't say.

"Because at some point you HAVE to buy groceries. So you are either spending Fiat or Crypto. In the meantime, you are either holding an inflationary or deflationary asset. Right now the thing holding crypto back isn't the fact that you ""don't spend investments"", it's that it's price is unstable.

I mean, I kinda understand where people are coming from when they make this point, but when you step back and look at it, it makes no sense at all.

People say BTC will never be used as a currency, because even if it's always going to be increasing in value, then you'll never sell it, you only hold it, forever.

But you have to eat. You have to pay bills. It doesn't matter where this money comes from, it needs to get spent. You either keep your ""savings"" in fiat in a bank, or in a decentralized ledger. In a bank, you pay account fees and maybe get 0.5% interest on an inflationary asset. Just holding something like Neo is 5% per year, on a deflationary asset.

I mean, it's the reason why you can't just sock away money in a safe, because you have to beat inflation or you are a chump longterm.

So yeah, you WANT to hold BTC forever, but the idea is that eventually you are going to spend money. Would you rather that money come out of a pile that is burning away with inflation, or a pile that is replicating itself due to increasing demand and locked supply?

That's not where we are now, that's where the eventual goal is. Since we're talking about eventual goal (i.e. can BTC EVER be used as currency if everyone just holds it), then it's valid.

For example, would you rather spend $9 today to buy a $10 burger next year (holding your savings in deflationary currency), or spend $11 today to buy a $10 burger next year (holding your money in an inflationary currency). In effect, that's what you are doing when you save money in a bank account in fiat. (Exaggerated for illustrative purposes).",1524759780

They need to just keep focusing on wallets, adoption and marketing, now that exchange issues appear to be handled, with universal blocks implemented.

People forget that BTC, ETH went through some serious shit before they got together. New coins don't get that ""get out of jail free card"". New tech like DAG and tangle could be what actually works on a global scale. What remains to be seen is sync and security issues.

"**Trade-off**

A trade-off (or tradeoff) is a situational decision that involves diminishing or losing one quality, quantity or property of a set or design in return for gains in other aspects. In simple terms, a tradeoff is where one thing increases and another must decrease. Tradeoffs stem from limitations of many origins, including simple physics - for instance, only a certain volume of objects can fit into a given space, so a full container must remove some items in order to accept any more, and vessels can carry a few large items or multiple small items. Tradeoffs also commonly refer to different configurations of a single item, such as the tuning of strings on a guitar to enable different notes to be played, as well as allocation of time and attention towards different tasks.

"Like mentioned above there is already a working alpha mvp live and has been before the mainsale started. Some bookings were already made and Concierge released an article on Medium where they interviewed their first customer.

In the alpha currently you can only pay with $CGE, later on people can pay in fiat and do not need to know anything about CGE tokens or even how the blockchain works. Concierge uses a third party that ensures that fiat is converted in CGE behind the scenes and vendors can choose to be paid out in CGE or fiat. 
The conversion ensures that there will be steady demand for CGE tokens regardless of what BTC, ETH or other crypto do. CGE tokens can also be used by vendors for advertising or loyalty and reward programs. By using the NEO ecosystem Concierge will charge 0% commission fees, so effectively the middle men (i.g. Booking, Expedia) are cut out and this can potentially result in savings from 15% to 45% of the price.

The importance is that Concierge is not only important to customers, but also to vendors because vendors will also be able to increase their own profit.

Other advantages are that customers can interact directly with vendors. Websites like Booking specifically attempt to circumvent such direct interactions as these parties would then be able to cut out the middle men and their margins. With direct contact, better information is possible instead of middle men who attempt to make a sale at any cost and more important: a better personalised experience. 

Blockchain transactions are also cheaper than using credit card companies and banks, so there are also further savings on the transaction side in case CGE tokens are used (possibly additional savings of 1-3%). Furthermore funds are locked into a smart contract, so that only when both customer and vendor are satisfied after check-out the funds will be released to the vendor. This also increases the quality. Immutable reviews on the blockchain also ensure greater objectivity.

Some people already had signficant savings by using CGE, but that is also in part the result of buying the tokens early which allowed them to book $100 hotel rooms for effectively $25.  
Likely prices will fall once more and more vendors get listed on the platform. Also keep in mind that CGE tokens effectively increase in value as more and more people start Concierge to do travel booking. This generates a base level of demand and thus a base level for the value of the tokens. The more people who use it, the more the CGE tokens will become worth. A simple to understand business model, but one of the first truly real world use cases of blockchain technology instead of merely speculation about future relevance",1524758945

&gt;You must be really new.

i've most likely have been here much longer than you. yeah bro everyone just fucking skirts the law and risky their livelihood and freedom because in le crypto land everything is illegal and banksters are all tyrants and corrupt. no dude, most people are normal and follow the law. everyone thinks everything is a fucking conspiracy. its a lot to risk to blatantly manipulate CME markets, especially when you're dealing with futures contracts that are settled at the end of each trading day. yeah lets open up shorts right before the trading day is over, a shitload of BTC is dumped on the open market and you just happen to open up a massive short at the right time. that wouldn't be obvious right? any idiot could put 2 and 2 together. if youre buying OTC then your identity is compromised too so if some gov agency wanted to investigate they could easily see who did what. 

&gt;Lastly, you don't know what the final disposition of the coins involved in those movements will be. If they aren't going anywhere why move them in the first place?

and you do? you're making a way bigger assumption than I am. the coins haven't moved anywhere. they're just sitting there. maybe they wanted to consolidate coins into a single wallet. its confirmed they arent allowed to sell off anymore coins until they get confirmation from a judge that the trustee is allowed to, the earliest that can happen is sometime later this summer.

How public perception of cryptocurrencies and blockchain, and the language we use to describe these technologies, will evolve.

Bubble. Tulip. Luck.

Blockchain and cryptocurrency currently occupy the “roll the dice” slot in the popular mind, as evidenced by a recent Scientific American headline that used “bitcoin” (BTC) as a shorthand for “risk” for a story about what parts of the human brain assess chance. Last December, a CNN Money story used the crypto trend as the hook for a roundup of famous market crashes, predictably aligning crypto with the 17th century tulip mania, the stock market crash of 1929 and the 2001 dot-com bust.

"**From the Article:**

""Blockchain is based on a model that is flawed and will be unable to scale to cope with the demand of the 75-100 billion 'Internet of Things' devices that will exist within 5-7 seven years.""

He believes that these connected devices will need a distributed ledger protocol to facilitate the massive flows of micro-data and micro-value in what he describes ""The Econnomy of Things"".

This protocol, he said, will be IOTA, which makes every user a miner in the sense that to have you own transaction validated on the network, there's a virtuous cycle requirement to perform the Proof of Work for two other, unrelated and randomly selected transactions in what he describes as the crypto-equivalent of Paying it Forward. He said this eliminates fees entirely but unlike blockchain models that have an inherent bottleneck, the IOTA Tangle only gets faster as more users and devices use it to the point that it becomes, theoretically at least, almost instantaneous.

He said: “The problem with the blockchain space right now is there are too many people with too many vested interests. There are folks who have invested millions of dollars into mining rigs and the like, and hundreds of startups and ICOs with little more than a whitepaper and a cool idea who have taken the millions of dollars from their ERC-20-based token raise, to build solutions that will never be able to scale to meet real-world use cases.

“These are the last people who are going to tell you that the blockchain is flawed, even if they increasingly have the sneaking suspicion that the tech might not be able to deliver on its promises.”",1524757877

* Swing traders - with good risk management will make the best money.

* Long term holders - with picking a top 5 coin today, you're good.

"first of all CME trades are futures contracts, second of all shorting isn't the act of just market selling so i dont know what you're talking about when you say dump them as ""CME shorts"". that literally makes no sense.

second of all buying up 16k BTC then dumping them on the open market would be insanely unprofitable. to buy up those 16k BTC you would have to pay market value for every single coin, if you dump 150M USD worth of BTC on the market you're going to run into massive slippage. so you effectively pay 150M for BTC, sell them off for ~100M because of slippage. you'd have to open up some massive shorts in order to cover those losses, not even that but its also massively risky to open shorts preemptively on that dump because the market might rebound extremely quick and then your profit margin would be tiny on the short, or maybe you'd even lose money because the market rebounded too quickly. 

shorting means to take out a loan of a commodity or asset, sell it at current prices, then buy it back at a lower price and give it back to the original loaner. you pocket the difference as your profit. when you short you also have to pay a loan fee, so you'd have to pay money for borrowing that asset.

finally, this is massively illegal to do regardless if its crypto. CME is massively regulated, and if youre manipulating CME markets, even if its bitcoin, you're committing a felony and would get into massive trouble.

"2) Works out the exact same way. If you are short a contract, you have the obligation to deliver whatever X is settled in. You must effectively buy back your contract. This is why the phrases ""buy to open"" and ""buy to close"" are important. 

3) Physically settling futures and BTC futures all have a time component to what the contract is worth. What cash or commodity moves hands, as well as mark to market is how price is displayed, not how value is calculated. 

Essentially, the money value of time is baked into futures contracts. That's why futures that are further out in time are always worth more. You seem to not understand basic pricing models regarding futures if I'm reading your comments correctly, and prices of the underlying and arb opportunities won't yield any interesting conversation if you don't understand the basics first.

Look for confirmation with volume. If volume is high on a down move, that means volume was high, and the price went down.

  10.5m + 5.25m + 12.5 * x = 17m
  12.5x = 17m - 10.5m - 5.25m
  12.5x = 1.25m
  x = 0.1m = 100k

The height for 17m btc is 210k + 210k + x, which is exactly 520000.

"&gt; Segwit is only a soft fork because the consensus breaking data is hidden to old nodes.
&gt; Segwit do break consensus rule, otherwise how come block bigger than 1MB get mined ?

Im starting to think you dont know how forks work now. The segwit part of the data is, as you know, hidden for old nodes and can never be held up against old concensus rules. Thats why segwit doesnt break backwards compatability, and why there is no old chain, unlike bcash where you have the ""clashic"" chain still being extended, and soon at the next fork the ""clashic 2nd ed."" chain due to the life support DAAs you got (in case someone mines it for lulz). If the pre-segwit chain got extended, blocks would simply be orphaned as old nodes would see the segwit activated chain as the longest valid chain.

This is a completely different situation than any hardfork.

&gt; This is not quite true, SF can lead to currency split (ex: segwit led to BCH splitting) and HF don’t always lead to two chains.

You are really starting to stretech your credibility here. Codewise a softfork does not cause chainsplits.  Sure, people can fork, but then its not the softfork that causes the split, its some other peoples code. I can just as well claim that me eating oatmeal for breakfast causes chain splits, because if I eat oatmeal I get a sudden urge to change concensus rules.

&gt; Yet this chain is a complete change of fundamentals and incentives.

No.

&gt; It is arguably the bitcoin fork that departe the most from Bitcoin original experiment.


No, bcash is. The DAA removes miners power to direct what code should be run, as blocks will always be generated rwgardless of hashpower. And I dont even agree that ""departing from the original experiment"" is a valid argument, as you can change anything in bitcoin you want to, as long as you have concensus. Maybe not the 21 mil limit I think we can all agree on at least that.

&gt; Maybe you can quote the white paper where the 1MB is described as a permanent economic feature, where the weight limit is discribe, where the segregated witness is explain, where the concept of settlement layer and fee market is explained?

We have larger than 1 mb blocks, so your even wrong about that, and second the purpose of the whitepaper is not some sort of blueprint that describes how bitcoin must be.

This is actually the weirdest thing about you guys tbh. You treat a whitepaper as some sort of religious gospel. It seems to me that you do this because you need some kind of authority to guide you.

Technically speaking, with out knowing what transaction IDs contain the data to make the image one could not decode it. So, whom ever has knowledge of that particular set of txIDs is technically the one that is in possession of CP.

Also each transaction pays a fee to be put into a block, the higher the fee the more likely it is to be picked for the next block, so when blocks start to fill up people pay higher and higher fees to ensure their transaction gets put into the next block.

BTC blocks can hold 7 transactions per second, so anything more than that they start to clog up and increase the fees.",1524754815

1) CME bitcoin futures are cash settled, so no bitcoin is actually changing hands. 

2) if you own a short futures contract, you have the obligation to deliver that product to the person who is long the same contract. Any bitcoin you are forced to buy because of the contract isn't yours. 

3) The futures contracts price doesn't only drop because bitcoin drops, it drops because time is worth something. All things equal, futures contracts lose value over time.

"$16 ain't bad for those amounts, even $8 is competitive. Consider:
I want to send $500 to my friend in Colombia. (I assume Colombia has an exchange that's similar to coinbase. I could be assuming incorrectly.)
I go to coinbase, buy $500 in BTC, LTC, or Eth. CB is going to take their pound of flesh (1.49% from bank account or cb USD wallet (remember you have to keep your money on the exchange, ie plan in advance, as it can take like 10 days for the ACH to clear) or 3.99% for an instant debit/credit card purchase (don't forget your cash advance fees on the latter, fuckers). 
The math so far:
$500 initial
$7.45 -$19.95 coinbase fee (1.49 vs 3.99) est
Total: 492.51 (best case) or 480.05 (max fee)
Now transfer money to my friend's Colombian exchange. That's going to cost some money. Right now I find the ETH fee is about $1.50 going from CB to Binance, which is fine for me, but there are apparently easier ways to do it if you want to add a GDAX transfer to the mix.
So now we're down to ~$478.55 - 491.01.
Friend gets the transfer, immediately sells. Her exchange probably charges a small fee for this sale, and then withdraws to a bank account, which probably takes a couple days. I honestly can't remember what CB charged me when I did my ETH sales awhile back (I don't sell that often.. HODL). But let's be generous and say there's a 1.5% fee here, which is another ~$7.50 or so. 
We're up to almost $20 in fees already. And she still has a few days before she can get her money for the exchange-&gt;bank transfer. I'm not considering volatility at the moment because this is a strict buy-sell action. And this assumes my friend has already setup an exchange account for her local pairing and a bank to transfer to/from.

$8 doesn't sound too bad, and you get your money within a few hours, but you do have to go to an office and stand in line, and maybe to the bank to cash the Money Order (I dunno, does WU/MG have a lot of cash on hand to just pay out?). 

Yes, I know there's going to be some folks yell at me about fees and what not. Guess what, folks? Not everyone keeps a lot of crypto on hand for payments. We buy it as we need it because that avoids the most of the volatility and we don't keep fiat in our coinbase (gemini) accounts. If you want to lose access to funds (by losing I mean if the money's in my checking account: have debit card, spend right now. If it's in savings account, I can transfer money in my app and immediately spend via debit card or withdraw directly from ATM). 

Crypto is great for sending a store of value across borders, but unless you want to forget about fees from fiat conversions and delays from withdrawals, well, you get the idea. It reminds me of the old Linux joke: Linux is only free if you don't value your time. ",1524754669

"i don't find gold analogous to bitcoin in anything other than it being analogously defined, ie, it is mined, and it bitcoin is a fully reserved banking system like austrian economists have fantasized about for gold.

gold is a currency of last resort, based on a history of use of currency.  that also does not, i believe, go swimmingly along with this 'store of value first' narrative around bitcoin, as i'm pretty sure gold as currency came about as all currencies did for large and complex system - at the behest of the king and government, who could use it to extract taxation.  that is certainly how our fiat currencies work now too, of course.

gold *was* essentially near cash.  in 2020 you are advised to keep some money in treasuries or bonds to keep it safe, a higher percentage if you're older.  back in 1920 that was gold, because the USD was almost as good as gold.  it of course wasn't *actually* as good, because of fractional banking.  but the point is the same - gold was money, for humans, for zillions of years.

gold is still a currency today as a result of that history - perhaps culturally for people who have dealt with nasty inflation in the past for use as savings or large purchases (vietnam) but it is certainly the currency of last resort in the global banking system - which is why central banks the world over are full of it.  it is the ultimate reserve currency, when you run out of x or x fails, where x is yen/eur/usd etc.

bitcoin does not live in this special circumstance or place at all.  it's a new currency.  if atlantis arose from the see and had atlantas bucks, it would have to earn its way into the world based on real organic use (and speculative forex trading) to find out what it's true purchasing power was.  but atlantis would have the benefit of requiring all its own citizens to use atlantis bucks, and if they demanded we pay in atlantis bucks for them to export the unobtanium they make, then the rest of the world would put even more real organic demand on their currency.

meanwhile bitcoin, nor any crypto, has no such requirement on its use.  at minimum, all taxes must be paid in the US with USD, and all court debts will be settled in USD.  bitcoin has no artificial state support forcing this use.  it can only stand on its merits alone.  it has to convince others to use it by being better.

better how?  well it's more difficult to fund a war if you have fully reserved banking and need to collect taxes via a currency you can't just print.  it can also offer much lower fees for merchants to use or individuals to transfer.  it can offer greater privacy.  through mobile use it can reach the financially excluded or underbanked.  it can route around currency controls and allow capital flight from an untrusted government, as well as an escape from a mismanaged currency.

if bitcoin doesn't get adopted for these things, then we're all just in a speculative circle jerk where some people win and some people lose, and the currency ends up being nothing but some kind of sentiment trading game.  which wouldn't make it a currency, nor even the store of value feature of one.",1524753155

The first is that ASIC resistant means GPU.  This isn't true, it is entirely possible to create a CPU centric proof of work algorithm with the same techniques (memory requirements and latency based algorithms that skip around in memory).  

Second, I don't know that there is any serious talk about changing the Bitcoin proof of work, I'm just saying that Andreas has no idea what he is talking about when he says you can't create an ASIC resistant algorithm.

Thrid, GPUs aren't just for gaming, though the generalization is probably fine.

"&gt; Is this true in any way? Can someone address this?

This was my impression of the core team over a year ago and why i decided to get involved as a developer.

My perspective was that I got into Bitcoin in the very beginning but I was also in grad school and couldn't spend the time on it. I think I even mined but I remember thinking that even if Bitcoin actually became worth something, the probability of me ""keeping up"" with the keys was pretty close to zero. 

So I just kinda went away. When I got back there was this 1M actual cap (I don't mean like before, when 1M was effectively ""no cap"") and once I spent enough time reading and things, I eventually I discovered Reddit-Bitcoin and the small block/big block debate. And I'm thinking ""this is a debate?"". And blockchain and banks and investors....and you know what I think is that now the core group is essentially infested with money interests.

Then, yeah all the ""store of value"" talk, it seemed pretty clear to me the focus had changed to one in which the most immediate concern was asset value (i.e. bitcoin price) rather than focusing on making some functional money that will help people.

And that was before I had ever heard of Jihan Wu or Roger or BU and certainly before BCH. 

A ""fork"" does not mean that one is the original and the other is not. It means there are now two copies of the original, neither of which is exactly like the original.",1524751760

"You’ll find that Bitcoin Cash supporters are not against second layers either but support the first layer being as resilient and reliable as possible. I don’t understand the resistance to upgrading by hard fork. If we’ll managed with consensus, no issue. 
The thing that you’re missing is that bitcoin cash IS bitcoin. It has the bitcoin genesis block, all the first 8.5 years of shared transaction history that the Bitcoin Core chain also shares. What happened in august is that part of the network forked off and took bitcoin in a different direction to what others wanted. From the BCH perspective, those people added segwit, restricted the blocksize until the mempool started crashing servers and refused to do anything about it, where as the other fork of Bitcoin has big blocks now, bigger blocks coming, and is actively preparing to scale exponentially in future. 
You talk about Roger Ver like he’s some sort of thief who came in the night and stole your money but the reality is he is just a businessman. He did so much for Bitcoin before the fork and I find it sad that you all turned on him when he disagreed with core on the best path to take. ",1524751579
"I talked about propagating the block. Propagating to other full nodes rapidly, the more tx are in the block and the more centralised the network is (only few economic nodes connected to only few miners), the harder/longer it takes for smaller miners to propagate it. It becomes very much a permissioned mining network.

Also ""because of usage"" or ""the sheer number of small transactions"" is absolutely hand wavy. You have no idea what the usage will be post halvening or after the next halvening either and therefore you don't know if usage will be enough to secure the chain properly. What we do know for sure is that the coinbase mining reward will be diminished (On bitcoin anyways, not confident yet bch wont modify coinbase mining reward in the future).",1524751566

For instance, if your code reads ""x = 1 + 1"", there is no way to optimize that line of code, it's already as fast as it'll ever be.

Bitcoin, in my opinion, is *very* close to it's maximum software efficiency today. Bitcoin needs to grow orders of magnitude until further optimizations liker multi-threadding and Xtreme thinblocks become actually needed. I tend to think bitcoin *will* grow orders of magnitude eventually, but it ain't happening today or next week or next month either. It'll be years. In the meantime people can do research on these optimizations, but deploying them shouldn't happen yet.",1524751546

"When BCH hits the quantity cap, many decades from now, there are two options:

1) Fees go up somewhat, but with such a huge number of transactions, costs can still remain very, very low compared to BTC.

2) A fork or new token that follows some kind of hard ""monetary rule"", like 1-2% quantity growth per year of coin quantity increases emerges and outcompetes other coins, including both BCH and BTC.

Some people will say ""but #2 is what we already have with fiat currencies!"" This is wrong.

Because of increases in productivity and global trade, governments have to print tremendous amounts of money to target a manipulated 2% rate of increase in CPI. That is not the same thing as a 2% quantity increase by any stretch.

If they just printed 2% per year of currency, prices would be *falling* instead. This is exactly what happened with gold, and if a crypto really wanted to emulate gold it should take this into account, along with a few other factors that are still missing. (Like variability of coin creation based on energy input.)

In any event, if such a fork outcompetes BCH as it currently exists, it would outcompete BTC too. The whole thing is voluntary, and it's a problem that is a long ways a way. It is a relatively easy one to solve one way or another if the will and the education is there.",1524751461

1\- The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions.

2\- The earliest transaction is the one that counts, so we don't care about later attempts to double\-spend.

"There are a few things that confuse me about the notion of ASIC resistance.  

First, why tie crypto to the PC GPU market?  In other words, why, for all time to come, link money with computer gaming?  I understand having an alternate use for the gear and its resale value, and maybe that's useful in the beginning of the experiment, but over the long haul with ASIC resistance investors can't invest in Bitcoin for example without also investing in something else (computer gaming) -- which seems counterproductive to me.  

GPUs also mine at reduced efficiency (than ASICs) all the way around, and with an increased footprint.  A lot more space and energy is eliminated by ASICs.

With ASIC resistance, and the fact that miners would have to build/manage more complicated and physically larger mining rigs, the barrier to entry (for investment in the network) is actually increased.  Wouldn't it be better to make investment in Bitcoin easier, instead of strictly for PC builders?  

Finally, I don't see why developers would want to place the domain of Bitcoin mining under the purview of existing GPU manufacturers who are already dominating their own marketplace, who can afford lobbyists and lawfare and other political tactics to put competitors down, and who maintain an expressly permissioned existence under the existing US regulatory apparatus.

If you're arguing that the government needs to introduce laws to protect Bitcoins trademark and grant the trademark to whoever has the biggest fork (biggest how? Most nodes, most transactions, most addresses?), that's a separate issue.

It's also a strange request from someone who is interested in decentralizing governance to want a central authority to protect bitcoin from unregulated competition.

"Mempool also does apply to both BTC and BCH, and any other currency that uses ""mining"" or similar tech.

To go back to your original question; Why is the Mempool a problem for BTC and not BCH;

This was the whole underlining reason for BCH and the clone - when BTC mines a new block, it will take a group of transactions out of the mempool, and ""confirm"" them - this is the guarantee that the transaction has taken place (essentially if you are trading in BTC you **require** the transaction to be confirmed, due to other features BCH doesn't have).

The problem is BTC can only take a small number of TX out of the mempool to be confirmed, because it has a small 1MB block size limit. BCH's cloning and split from BTC was done by those of the Bitcoin community who believe we should increase this 1MB limit.

BCH doesn't have any issues with the mempool because our blocks are 8MB (soon to be 32MB), meaning there is more than enough place for **all** transactions every block, there have been a few cases when BCH blocks were full, but these were only experiments done to ""show off"" the 8MB blocks, and to prove they didn't break the network (which was previously claimed by Core and BTC).",1524750939

&gt;Long story short: The Core team of Bitcoin developers decided against increasing the block size, which led to large transaction fees, instead of the proposed solution of Segwit/LN which should provide off\-chain scaling some people decided to instead fork the Bitcoin code and increase the block size.

&gt;  
&gt;Since both implement the Bitcoin protocol for transferring information and storing the transactions both have the right to be called Bitcoin, BTC supporters claim that since they own the original github they should be the only ones with right to the Bitcoin name, and BCH supporters claim that since they adhere more strictly to what is described in the whitepaper they should be the ones called Bitcoin.

"But that's why you can't look at the spikes and dips but rather the baseline growth. You don't get 100x gains without exposing yourself to risk. That's why your portfolio should only be 10-20% crypto and not 100%. I mean, you can go 100% and maybe get rich, but you can also get rich by investing 20% in crypto, just not ""own my own country"" rich. I'm happy with just ""retire early"" rich. That's good enough for me.

So erase the spikes, and look for long term baseline growth. I mean LONG term, to the point where Jan to April is a single candle on a massive chart that is 99.9% bull market.

Buy and hold, it's really that simple. As long as you buy solid coins and don't try to get rich overnight, nothing you buy today will look bad in 10 years. Make adjustments to make sure you are holding good tech, but don't chase those daily 30% pumps. I'll take 1% per week steady anyday over some random +/- 30% daily pumping.",1524750586
"Just because something was planned to be one thing doesn't mean it can't become something else. Crypto was meant to be decentralized, but centralized versions might be the winners in the end, that's how this works. That said, Ripple is by no means fully centralized, as there is 100+ nodes where 20 of these are run by Ripple. Every node has a vote on what goes on. Ripple is working with banks, specialists, who has experience with transfering value for decades and knows what people want. Ease of use and low fees. 

NANO as you say is still in it's early stages, and as a hodler myself, I'd very much like the project to succeed in becoming an alternative way of payments. However until it gains more traction from retailers and volume starts to increase, there's nothing to say it will be gone in 3 years because they were simply too late spreading the word. Ripple has working products, pilots, clients and a huge head start in marketing compared to NANO.

There can be more than one. Stop choosing sides and invest in both. Don't be too stubborn to miss a great opportunity. ",1524750581

For the reading comprehension challenged, ""WE"" is a collective term implying consensus. Consensus means general agreement among a group of people. In Bitcoin, a super majority of 95% agreement has been the standard for that. Additionally, Satoshi's use of ""IF"" is a conditional term, a *possibility* (which might entail *never*), but more pointedly ""IF"" defies your claim that Bitcoin was MEANT to increase the blocksize. Furthermore, deciding when such conditions have been met is not a decision that any minority group (such as the Bitcoin Unlimited group of 21 people who decided to create BCH) is entitled to make for the wider community.

The only time the price needs to be high is when you sell. I'm not selling for 10 years. I have zero doubt that even a $20k BTC buy in Dec is going to look bad in Jan 2030.

Would you be mad if you sold all your $1.50 BTC so that you could get a slightly better deal at $1, but it just didn't go back down and you just always sat there waiting for the better time to get back in?

Don't sweat the small pullbacks... time in the market beats timing in the market. HODL is a meme, but it's a meme for a reason. You either believe in this longterm or you don't. If you don't, then why are you even here?

By analysing the charts at Bitfinex, when market pumps happen, they usually happen in all the cryptos, sometimes before bitcoin is pumped, sometimes after.

I honestly don't believe that other cryptos value is correlated to the bitcoin value in USD. In my opinion, this is just traders dispersing investment through several cryptos pairs, in order to access the maximum liquidity, so that when it is time to get the profit out, they are able to do so without completely crashing the market and hence, maximizing their short-term profit.

&gt; Sadly larger block weights don't have research behind it proving it wouldn't hurt smaller miners

Please [read this](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_hashing_algorithm), particularly this relevant bit:

&gt;The body of the block contains the transactions. These are hashed only indirectly through the Merkle root. Because transactions aren't hashed directly, **hashing a block with 1 transaction takes exactly the same amount of effort as hashing a block with 10,000 transactions.**

In other words, larger blocks don't require more work, and therefore wouldn't in themselves be harmful to smaller miners. 

Moreover, usage/adoption is the whole point, so we should be assuming Bitcoin will actually be used in day to day commerce. Block sizes should grow with usage, so ensure transaction fees are always low. 

Miners will continue being rewarded for keeping the network secure. Why? Because of usage - the sheer number of small transaction fees will add up to a significant reward for miners, while keeping fees low for users. Everybody wins.",1524749712

EOS is so insanely overvalued, but maybe it has higher longterm potential? I dunno.

You know what happened in the internet boom? The second one sector had one company that established its foothold, a thousand clones popped up trying to get a piece of the pie.

Currently, people hodl, because they have the incentive of value appreciation, and they spend instead their USD/EUR/JPY/GBP, for example.

But I'm now currently very sceptical about all the crypto ecosystem. From the moment that merchants are accepting multiple cryptos, will we trully have a crypto-scarcity? Bitcoin value speculation is based on it's 21M limit. But from the moment there's a large amount of cryptos being accepted, do we truly have that limit? I'm beginning to question that.

The community spent years polling, debating and  discussing a block size and the vast majority rejected a hard fork to increase blocksize. No, not consensus. The resulting contentious hard fork creating 2 separate incompatible chains leaves no other interpretation.

As the price of BCH rises it's ability to transact as a currency becomes limited. It's why stocks and bonds aren't used as a form of payment, there's no consistent valuation. 

It could be argued that BCH has only made it easier or at least more appealing to speculators to purchase the coin. 

I'll suffice to say that when I can purchase the majority of my end use products with crypto, at the point of sale and not on the internet (gas stations, grocery stores, etc.) I would be very surprised to find BTC or BCH at the end of that proverbial use case rainbow.

He's not a very popular figure around here because his response to reading the Bitcoin white paper was to declare that it couldn't possibly work, then when it continued to work despite his naysaying he engineered a situation (maintaining 1mb blocks long past the point where an anti-spam measure was necessary) which would break Bitcoin in line with his predictions.",1524748565

What if there is one large buyer that agreed 3 days ago to buy Mt. Gox's 16K BTC and BCH.

They then put in lots of buy orders on Bitfinex at 60% of current Mkt price. Then sold heavily - with a mkt order, flashcrashing the mkts in several coins.

They then swept these up with their discounted buy orders.. and are already 40% in profit from these -- as the price rebounded straight away.

And the Mt. Gox move today, was bought by them on a Dark pool.

Net result --- They have the same amount of BTC and BCH... but lots of additional coins from buying the flash crash.

Because as far as I am aware there is not... seems to take days for the above process and prices fluctuate enough that you could lose (or gain I guess) 10% of the initially sent money. If you want to speed this process up, you have to pay a higher fee (e.g. credit card processing fee rather than bank transfer to an exchange). It is much cheaper/quicker to use something like Transferwise.

"Well we keep putting new technologies on top of the basic blockchain, like the lightning network. This means that you will have a smaller and smaller need for actually making a transaction on the base chain itself. 

In other words there will come A LOT of new users. This will make more transactions and therefore probably a lower fee. Furthermore the systems on top of the chain will probably be the ones one usually use and they would have a way lower fee! 

But see how far we are now... We have a lot of years to invent the perfect systems and technologies for this. In part we can thank all the altcoins for doing a lot of the testing needed to know when it is secure and viable to implement such technologies onto Bitcoin. 

This is also why many people thinks Bitcoin lacks after and think that one crazy coin is the new thing! They show a new technology a new way of transactions.. but really Bitcoin is just waiting for people on the crazy coin to do the testing - and if it is worth implementing then it will.

I just have a complete different vision for btc.

You can not get it back or redeem it most of the time after buying the tokens. You can use the tokens to pay for stuff on the sites (f.e. playing poker). Now imagine instead of buying tokens you would just open an LN channel (if you're not already connected) to pay for stuff. 
F.e. with that poker app example -&gt; every bet, every action and every shit handled by the game could be made on LN. Or imagine a streamer streaming videos for 0.001 satoshis / second.

for a blockchain like Neo you need 150 billion to have the same control over the blockchain.

its like you cant even read what you are writing, the point of smart contracts is that you should not have to rely on a third party for your tokens. the whole point of smart contracts is to eliminate the third party.

Fees are not a failure, it's the future. You can't secure your public blockchain properly without a healthy fee market if you have diminishing mining rewards. Even worse, if you make it harder for individuals to run their full node and for small miners to mine and propagate their blocks through larger blocks, you sacrifice the main selling points of bitcoin: trustlessness and censorship  resistence.

That being said given optimisations that bitcoin developers have added over last couple of years and will add soon, I think block weight limit could be made bigger than their current 4MB limit. 
However I don't think Hard forks are doable without significant risk to a decentralised network unless it is shown to have very strong consensus amongst most network participants AND it is proven safe enough. 

Sadly larger block weights don't have research behind it proving it wouldn't hurt smaller miners or that usage would be high enough to still have enough fees to covering diminishing inflation profit loss after halvenings. And more importantly making a HF for a simple bump would be useless in the long term so risk/reward ratio seems off.

"&gt;If this doesn't prove to you that Satoshi's Bitcoin was meant to have its blocksize increased, then we can agree to disagree.  IMHO, if you didn't want to follow Satoshi's vision, you should have started your own coin.

This quote always pops up in these discussions. It doesn't really prove anything other than Satoshi had thought about how a block since increase could be phased into the system. It's one thing for an engineer to think about how a problem could potentially be solved, an another thing to be of the opinion that the problem is in fact something worth addressing.

You're extrapolating ""This is how something can be implemented"" to mean ""I want this to be implemented"".

This is the main thing I find wrong with the BCH community. You skew everything in your favour. Satoshi isn't stating that he wants blocks to be of unlimited size, but you make it sound like he does. Same thing applies to the ""Peer to peer electronic cash as defined in the white paper"" mantra. BTC and BCH have differing views on how a problem \(scalability\) should be solved. But it's incredibly frustrating to read the ""Bitcoin isn't cash, Satoshi had the word cash in the white paper"" sentiment over and over again, like it means something",1524745243

"I would say that it was probably just a switch in terms of supply and demand with a big increase in populations (which really started in the 1930's).

Now we are closer to 8 billion in a much shorter timeframe so the competition for space has increased and there property has gone up. Also most people have gravitated to living in cities which has put extra demand pressure on real estate.

The difference is that everyone needs somewhere to live, not everyone needs crypto so probably not a good idea to compare the two. Although crypto has attracted people because there is only a limited amount of each. The problem at the minute is that there are too many cryptocurrencies and not all will survive so for the OP to be correct, you will have to pick the one that survives.

You keep a % of your portfolio in riskier investments like crypto and then allocate into other asset classes based on how much risk you are comfortable with and how much longer you will likely live.,1524745021

"Lets say you and I put 1 BTC on BitMEX and you take a short position and I take a long position at 10x. BTC dumps and I (stupidly) didn't set a stop loss or didn't think it would dump so much as to hit my liquidation figure so fast.


I get liquidated (bye bye 1 BTC). You took the short so you make money off the dump.


BitMEX uses swap contracts, meaning there is a party on the other side who you are effectively betting against  (in basic terms). They also use funding where shorts/longs pay depending on the open positions and some other calculations. This is to encourage people taking an opposite position to what is the 'trend'. So in the example above, maybe the trend was that we are going down and there are more shorts open then longs - so what do they do? The ""funding"" is set so that having a long position means you get paid (a percentage every X amount of hours) and those in short positions have to pay the funding. So again, one side is gaining, the other is losing.


If you just moved your BTC to BitMEX and left it there and didn't take a position, it would just sit there, it's not being used for anything, and you can withdraw it tomorrow no matter what happens to shorts and longs.


The 'lending' exists because someone is getting liquidated, and because shorts/longs pay funding rounds (which are calculated roughly as explained above). 


It's obviously a lot more complicated than this, but my point is that there is another party on the opposite end of every position on BitMEX.",1524744896

They then put in lots of buy orders on Bitfinex at 60% of current Mkt price. Then sold heavily - with a mkt order, flashcrashing the mkts in several coins.

They then swept these up with their discounted buy orders.. and are already 40% in profit from these -- as the price rebounded straight away.

And the Mt. Gox move today, was bought by them on a Dark pool.

Net result --- They have the same amount of BTC and BCH... but lots of additional coins from buying the flash crash.

"Unless you've got a more recent node count, you're talking out of your ass. So you're saying 167 nodes that can validate all transactions on the blockchain aren't ""masternodes""? Lmfao. I like how you just rebut with ""NO THEYRE NOT JUST STOP"" instead of an actual discussion pertaining to it.  

Decentralized does matter though buddy. You'll learn this someday, it's actually the entire point of crypto. Without it we could just use the save payment servers we have been with centralized USD like we have been. Which blockchains have had cases of double spend though? You speak as if it's only ripple.

Neither have higher chance of adoption. Idk how many times I have to reiterate, decentralized always beats centralized. See ripple to bitcoin if you don't believe me ;). Even BitShares could handle WAY more tx output. Weird how theyre slowly edging closer and closer to a half a billion market cap. 

See this is how I know I'm talking to someone who has no clue lmao. I'm saying ripple has the same exact properties of an ERC20, so putting its equivalency on the Ethereum network won't be a problem at all. 

Please go research the basics of blockchain kid. Clearly all of this stuff goes way over your head. We were all get rich quick kids at one point. But even I wasn't dumb enough to think to ever invest in ripple :).

"**Executive Order 6102**

Executive Order 6102 is a United States presidential executive order signed on April 5, 1933, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt ""forbidding the Hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates within the continental United States"". The limitation on gold ownership in the U.S. was repealed after President Gerald Ford signed a bill legalizing private ownership of gold coins, bars and certificates by an act of Congress codified in Pub.L. 93–373 which went into effect December 31, 1974.

"Excellent site, now as you should know from statistics 1 average is a very bad value to use in such scenarios using the median value is always preferable. So let's compare the recent price in BTC fees \(1.604\) with BCH \(0.005\), and you're correct sir, it's not 54 times larger, it's 320 times larger, or 320,000&amp;#37; more.

For everyone unfamiliar with statistics the average can be skewed by a very large value, say we have 99 persons paying 1 cent for a product and 1 person paying 1 dollar for it, the average price of that product is 10 cents, which is 10x greater than what 99&amp;#37; of the people paid for it, but the median value is 1 cent, because the median value is a value that can split the group into two equally sized groups it's a better answer to the question ""how much are people paying for it"", in the case of BTC at least half of the persons that send a transaction today are spending more than $1.6 on transaction fees.",1524744336

"&gt; PoS and Asic resistance is considered to be a better decentralization mechanic.

By who? In my book, there is no working PoS so far, it is all in sketches (let's not consider centralized crypto a serious implementation of PoS) and Asic resistance is absolutely political idea. The suggestion that PoS is better for decentralization is ludicrous, as all the stakers need to do it to stake forever, they can't be removed. In PoW you need to stay competitive or you are out. So PoS is far worse for decentralization.

You might say that PoS is better because it saves energy, that is a good point, but apart form that I see nothing better. There is only one thing that could help in PoS, it is when people want to fork to another chain, it is easier to slash stakes than to blacklist IPs.

As for smart contracts, they are obviously very cool but still limited. Tokenization does not need smart contracts, all interesting tokens are securities anyway, this means they hold a promise from a third party. The automation is indeed very interesting but, ultimately, the token paid to you needs to be redeemed with a third party.",1524744300

"&gt;Although you're right in saying nobody knows right now, I think the suggestion that a hard fork to continue block subsidies *will be required* is quite fanciful. The reality is that difficulty can adjust down as well as up.

And 51% attack get cheaper.

&gt; If enough miners leave, difficulty will drop until it's economic for *somebody* to mine. The only question will be if that will still provide enough security for the network. I believe if transaction fees per block are low in value by that point, that would mean there's not much value in the block chain to secure. On the other hand, if the block chain is useful to many and transmits large amounts of value, just the transaction fees in each block should be quite valuable. I bet it will be self-regulating, and that the natural market equilibrium point will be just fine.

I agree with you, I believe with capacity onchain the balance will be found.

But regarding the small block approach will break that feedback relationship and prevent the blockchain to find a proper equilibrium (tx fee paid on second don’t directly relate to the PoW paid anymore).

1. Invest in Bitcoin
2. Bitcoin goes up, trade it for ETH/alts
3. ETH or alt/BTC pair rises in value, trade back for BTC
4. Profit

"&gt;&amp;gt; Why that doesn’t apply to the segwit fork?
&gt;First, its a soft fork so its not incompatible with the old chain, so theres not even a question, 

Segwit is only a soft fork because the consensus breaking data is hidden to old nodes.



Segwit do break consensus rule, otherwise how come block bigger than 1MB get mined ?

With segwit opd node are downgraded to SPV security, “zombie nodes”.

&gt;no chain to kill off. 

This is not quite true, SF can lead to currency split (ex: segwit led to BCH splitting) and HF don’t always lead to two chains.

&gt;Second, when it forked it happened with majority hashpower.

Yet this chain is a complete change of fundamentals and incentives.

It is arguably the bitcoin fork that departe the most from Bitcoin original experiment.

&gt;&amp;gt; Satoshi will point out that the segwit is a different project than the one described in the white paper.

&gt;lol no.

Maybe you can quote the white paper where the 1MB is described as a permanent economic feature, where the weight limit is discribe, where the segregated witness is explain, where the concept of settlement layer and fee market is explained?

A good number of those investments went nowhere and would have been better left in Bitcoin, however the ones that took off gave me gains far exceeding the losses on the losers.

"I was there too. Most of this biased review is pretty accurate though.

As someone that found out about the event via the let’s talk bitcoin podcast and lives in Chicago, I was very satisfied and enjoyed myself.

So my frame of reference is as follows:
- frequent but not religious LTB podcast listener
- been to a single small grass roots crypto meetup a year ago
- bitcoin enthusiast since 2013

The intro was longer than it should’be been

I’ll agree the conduct portion had me rolling my eyes but when I stopped to think about it, this is in direct response to some other crypto events that have been causing a stir because they’ve gained a reputation for misogynistic behavior.  I didn’t need to hear someone talk about any of this publicly. It annoyed me but I’ll donate my five minutes of wasted time if that part raised the comfort level of anyone in the crowd. They’re only trying to make it a positive atmosphere

The bitcoin songs?  Completely accurate review. I felt bad for that Tatiana person but more power to her. I won’t be standing in line to see her play anytime soon but it takes balls of steel to not only write those songs but perform them in front of an eager 700 strong crowd.  Use Bitcoin when you pay!

Andrea’s talk was perhaps lacking a lot of substance but it was still incredibly satisfying to see the talk live instead of on the web.  Don’t forget the entire thing was billed as a five year commemoration of the podcast and his book.  I think it’s pretty clear that the entire event was geared toward publicity and a bit of set-congratulations.  There was no direct topic list billed.

The live podcast was also entertaining to put a face to the voices I’ve been listening to off and on for years.  So that part was a treat for anyone that was all in on the event.  There wasnt a lot of technical discussion, but it spoke to me on a general community level. I kind of feel your review isn’t 100% fair since you even admit you left half way through.  But I can also see how this would be boring if you don’t listen to these people or know who they are.

I met some cool people, like the guy who randomly was sitting next to me from Brazil who I later found out is contributing to Andrea’s next book. Who knew?

I snuck out of the theatre before the end of the episode taping and was maybe #7 in line to get my book signed?  Great move since the line grew rapidly after the last goodbyes

Andreas and the podcast grew gave me some great photo ops and I hope to someday use these as evidence of my involvement, even if superficially, in a cultural movement that inspired lasting change in the world.",1524742559

"**Brand**

A brand is a name, term, design, symbol, or other feature that distinguishes an organization or product from its rivals in the eyes of the customer. Brands are used in business, marketing, and advertising. Name brands are sometimes distinguished from generic or store brands.

The practice of branding is thought to have begun with the ancient Egyptians who were known to have engaged in livestock branding as early as 2,700 BC. Branding was used to differentiate one person’s cattle from another's by means of a distinctive symbol burned into the animal’s skin with a hot branding iron.

"Flawed logic.  You can **still** mine BTC from anything with processing power.  It's not profitable, maybe... but that's the point.  The security of Bitcoin is held up by the miners' investment \(electricity and hardware\).  That's what Proof of Work means.  Even before ASICs, it was an arms race: first, the miners with faster CPUs would win more blocks, then when GPU hashing came along, it was the miners who spent more on video cards who won the blocks.  Look at other coins where ASICs haven't been developed...

Satoshi knew that hashing\-power would inevitably go higher... Although nine years ago, we thought Moore's Law would hold and we'd be using CPUs with 64 cores at 100Ghz speeds by now.  An ASIC is in\-line with the tech we're using now: processors that have been designed to handle specific instructions.

The thing is, anyone reading this today is still very much early adopters. Unfortunately half of us are going to look back and remember how smart we felt when we sold out on the pullback from 9700 to 9000. 

And it will be just as cringeworthy as the guy who outsmarted the market and sold when it fell from $10 to $8 and cashed out.

That's why even if you cash out now, leave $1k of something tiny in the game still, just in case you are comically incorrect about where this is going.  ",1524741134

From what i have noticed with current whales, the kind of buy and sell walls they deal with is 50 to 100BTC. I 100% agree this is fucked, manipulation like this is not needed and im open to the idea of regulation with that shit.

BUT, i find these tactics tend to be found on certain coins, and the are usually the less successful backalley type coins. You do see it on 'good' coins at times, but the other point here is anybody with very very basic understanding of markets and trading can spot it very easily.

Its just a matter of looking at the order book, the depth charts, and thats about it, problem solved. I know that whales influence markets in other ways however, its not just buy and sell walls.

Anyway, coming to my point, the current 'whales' seem pretty damn small time in the greater scheme of things. You think a 100BTC sell wall manipulation is big? We havent even seen much medium sized money get into this, wait until Soros puts down a 1000BTC wall.

Similarly- Bad news is a short signal, good news is a long signal. Traders are basically always trying to make profit and don't gaf about the sentiment or ultimate price of bitcoin or whether it makes sense or is morally commendable.

&gt;I was just giving binance as an example, the point is that news, whether or not its actually negative, causes a negative perception in the market, people start selling off. margin traders are usually the first to start which then trickles down.

And what I explained applies to every example. You are confusing cause and effect. The news causes the selloff because it's a short signal. By the time ""negative perception"" reaches the layman the market is already down and the news is old. And ironically enough, the time frame you are referencing when all those events happened is precisely when Kobayashi market sold tremendous amounts of BTC, lol, which proves my point I made from the very beginning.

"Each to their own.

The reason I'm in crypto is because I'm not sure I can trust the current financial system. That being said, Crypto is as much an experiment as the traditional financial system so diversifying would be smart. I would cash out a little but I'd leave a significant portion in staking coins\(DPOS, POS, POD, VBFT, DBFT\) to generate income. Enough to generate a yearly Salary in a worst case, bubble\-pop scenario.

In particular, I'd make sure I have enough invested coins like OMG and NEX which act like Dividend paying securities based on their respective platform's transaction volume. You can then exchange the returns for fiat. OMG will allow you to accept payment in any digital asset, essentially allowing you to print Bitcoin if you wanted\(not really but that's how I'm going to think about it\). NEX will allocate a &amp;#37; of whatever is traded e.g. RPX, QLC. You'll have to manually exchange for your token of choice. Sorry for the ad/shill of my favourite coins, but there is a reason they're my favourites. These coins serve a purpose to both the traditional and new financial systems. 

Get on that staking and you will have little to worry about.

p.s. some quality coins that will give returns now or in future: ETH\(when it switches to POS\), EOS, ADA, NEO, ICX, ONT, VEN, NAS, OMG, NEX, ARK, MAN, HPB and keep an eye on COSMOS' ATOM coin. Good luck!",1524739566

"
&gt;But the methods chosen to achieve them were not what people wanted.



I have to disagree here. Let's start with me, the methods chosen certainly were what I wanted. But I'm irrelevant, OK. So let's talk about businesses and the community.

Of course businesses will prefer big blocks, absolutely obviously. Instead of having to implement the better solutions, better for Bitcoin NOT their business, they would just have to upgrade their nodes. The latter costs a lot less!! It's basically ""externalising cost"" (full nodes bear the cost of larger blocks) and ""privatisating profits"". No surprises there. Also pretty clear to me we shouldn't do what businesses want.



The community. I know you'll downvote me for it, but the reality is that the majority wants (and wanted) SegWit+L2 scaling. It's the minority that wants big blocks, that's a fact. Look at how many followed BCH when it happened... a small minority. And despite the increase in subscribers to r-btc, it's still a small minority. Maybe this will change one day, but it certainly isn't the case today, nor was it last year.

All in all, Bitcoin went where the community at large wanted it to go, not businesses. And that is great.

"So this is your confirmation bias, as I've already stated. You are selecting only parts of what happened but assembling it in ways that support your argument which wouldn't work if you took all the pieces. Let's look at the unfoldment of the binance hack movement as it actually occurred:

- binance gets hacked

- margin traders are alerted of the event and close large long positions and open shorts

- stop losses are triggered, driving price down further 

- large positions start liquidating, driving price down much further and faster

- longs are squeezed and very large positions on low leverage are forced to close parts of their position or hedge by entering shorts 

- market momentum is strongly downward and traders who closed longs now enter shorts.

By the time this happens, the price has already moved significantly. Only now do redditors catch news of the event, make posts and say ""aha! So this is the FUD that dumped the market!"" ""Stop panic selling guys!!"" Etc etc.

"Don't have time to explain in depth, but here are my 2 cents (or about 0.000015 BCH): 

&gt; Isn't lightning network kind of like admitting defeat on blockchain

Yep, totally. What BTC advocates is that the Bitcoin idea (PoW) sucks and we need something totally different (LN). Yet this new thing is not an ICO, it's the Original Bitcoin™ and everything else, even if it's doing what BTC did for the first 8 years (BCH) is just a cheap fork scam. 

&gt; It leads to centralisation

The idea is that if blocks are very big, only big farms will be able to download and verify them. Which is true, but it's already the case - all pools are big hardware farms, no matter that the blocks are 1MB. The BTC argument is that non miners should also be able to validate blocks.. but that makes zero sense. 

&gt; If it leads to centralization then why dont we change the algorithm to something ASIC resistant

The ASICs argument is a different concern to centralization, not the same as the big-block concern, though it's also as invalid. 

&gt; Also why cant we make block times faster like Litecoin

Only because it doesn't matter. Without a reliable 0-conf, Bitcoin is not useful as a currency. With it, block times don't matter.

If anything the fact that people are wishing to make these large purchases of BTC should be seen as a bullish sign but nope they use it as FUD and make people panic sell which then causes the dump, not Mt Gox.",1524738661

Fear of miners is not really a problem when you think about it.  Coins only have value because users are willing to buy or accept them.  If all the miners do something the users don't like,  users will move to another coin and miner profits go down because the mined coins aren't as valuable.  If only a few miners do something bad, their blockchain is orphaned by the majority of miners.  

Building a system where users don't have to worry about getting ripped off is literally the problem Bitcoin was designed to solve, which it does just fine since the original white paper.

Most of the unfounded concerns with Bitcoin are because people fail to recognize the genius in bitcoins design - the combination of distributed systems design, economic game theory, and cryptography.  Its incredibly rare to understand all 3 concepts and how they work together, so most people feel the is a need to ""fix"" problems that are actually already solved in the current system.",1524738513

BTC is falling behind in everything, except price speculation. Negative adoption, LN doesn't work, BTC blockchain is the DMV of cryptos: long lines, high fees and frustration. In over 3 years of centralizing core development, bitcoin didn't advance and just lost community.

I'm probably never going to be making a $50,000 transaction to be quite honest, though I really wish I would! Or at least not before Bitcoin takes over the world

I sent a BCH transaction before a couple of times and it actually took quite a long time for it to send, and I just concluded it was because of block times. I also like Ethereum and I recently did a few transactions with it and it was absolutely great. It took 2 minutes and cost £0.02. I'm happy with that

Ill try sending another BCH one in a minute and see how long it takes me


But about centralisation again, I dont think its a good idea to have BCH miners to be able to push any changes they want, and I just have to trust that they will act in my interests.

While there are plenty of scarce resources in the world, they are not used as payment (instead stuff like fiat is used) nor is there a role similar to a crypto miner (aka validating transactions world wide).

However, the simply economic theory of supply and demand should apply here. Right now miners mostly get their income from block rewards. As soon as that well dries up, they are only left with transaction fees to pay their bills. Thus, supply and demand should correct the market to ensure that miners break even at the very least purely from fee income. It's important to note that this correction can take many forms, so it's by no means guaranteed that fees will go up by that time.

After all, fees are based on many factors like price (likely to go up due to scarcity) and the number of transactions. A sharp decline in energy costs can lower the fees substantially as well. The most important aspect remains competition though: if there's little of it, fees are more likely to increase.",1524736780
"I'd need to know the size of your transaction to give an accurate response. If it's a typically sized transaction (one input, two outputs), then BCH is only about 471% cheaper in this case (a typical BCH fee is currently $0.0035). Are you getting 471% more value and utility from your BTC transactions?  

But keep in mind, you happened to send your transaction less than a day after an 8-12 hour period of congestion where fees were typically ~$2.25. If you send your $0.02 transaction right before another such episode, you'll wind up like this user:

Using crypto as a payment is way off imo, and yes, until security is better and easier adoption isn't going to come.

"&gt; Lightning network

Your thoughts are correct and it's even worse than you think. Check out this [short and simple video](https://youtu.be/pOZaLbUUZUs) for a jaw dropping explanation on the lightning network.

&gt; centralization

ASICs aren't a problem, new asic manufacturers are already [coming online](https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/31/samsung-confirms-asic-chips/).  ASIC resistance is also a myth but that discussion is pretty technical.

The actual centralization problem is development teams which can make or reject changes to Bitcoin that are against its best interests - like refusing a minor block size increase to 2mb to avoid choking the network with $50 fees.

&gt; faster blocks

BCH has instant transactions because it removed replace-by-fee.  Mathematically you can be &gt;99% confident that your transaction will be confirmed in a block, which is good enough for everyday use.  

For everything else, when you are making a $50,000 transaction then does it really matter if you wait 2 minutes or 10?

BCH is focused on making the right trade offs for maximum adoption (instant is better for stores than 2 minute waits).

Faster blocks is another way to limit block size because it increases mining orphan rates so you can't afford any delay transmitting a mined block.

No, BTC is as much Bitcoin as BCH is they're just different implementations. That's why I see no issue listing BCH as Bitcoin (BCH) and BTC as Bitcoin (BTC) when listing them for sale.

It does to me, actually, in the sense that Bitcoin was always about giving economic freedom and Independence to everyone, not just the wealthy. BTC is still a faction of Bitcoin, but not the original design or purpose.

Yes, I do think that's fair, because it's true from my view. As long as the differences between the two are made clear and no active misleading is involved - e.g. someone wants BTC and you give them BCH.

"Wow. While I admire your *instant* takeaway for being totally pro-crypto, that is NOT why I said what I said. I would not be in this sub if I were not pro-crypto. I might ultimately shitpost here but that doesn't mean I don't actually read threads and their comments. If anything, I try to make light of most of the shit because people in this sub take themselves far too seriously.

Now back to actually why I said what I said: AZ is a traditionally red state that is leaning toward purple but will probably never truly be blue. There are ""pockets of blue"" (as my sister would say, for she lives in one in MO), but the overall attitude in AZ, as I understand it, is to be fiscally conservative and socially libertarian (this is a broad observation, of course, but not entirely inaccurate).

Here you've got a state that has legalized medical marijuana but not recreational marijuana, and yet they are trying to embrace blockchain technology? The ""we don't particularly like the gov't but don't care what you do in the privacy of your own home"" attitude is only good for one issue, then? Why not both? I don't live there so I can't exactly speak to it, but that's the understanding I have come to know. The political climate and social attitudes are all over the place. The laws are a bit here and there. It's not a *bad thing*, by any means, but one must admit that the state and its politics are, well, kinda goofy, especially when you can't get recreational marijuana legalized but blockchain and cryptocurrencies are seemingly welcomed with open arms.

That's all I meant by it. In the overall scheme of things, I think it is great that there is more adoption into different state legislatures (re: IL and now WY, and supposedly CA). I am currently living in a state where things are not too friendly toward crypto (no, not NY). But my statement was overall lightly comedic in nature and hardly a commentary about crypto itself. More or less a social comment about how people/legislators seem to favor one thing that is viewed as ultimately liberal and yet are affiliates of a party/stance that can be quite the opposite.",1524734557

"I'll preface this by saying. I would LOVE to be proven wrong. 

But fundamentally nothing major has changed in cryptospace at all since this time last year. 

There is no widespread adoption, it is still difficult to buy crypto with fiat, there is no real reason to use crypto yet, the majority of projects haven't brought their products to market.

The December January fomo bull run was great, but we came back to reality with a nearly 80% market correction. A lot of people invested a lot of money to get it up to $800b and the same people lost a lot of money on the way down. The correction was still happening at the beginning of April.

You don't recover from something like that in a few weeks.

Now I'm not saying $9.8k BTC and alts are finished for this run, they could very well have more to go, I'm not a fortune teller. But until something fundamentally changes with the crypto space and it goes from speculation to adoption I just can't imagine it going parabolic again.

In a given timeframe no orders will tell the customer to pay the exact same amount of crypto coins due to an algorithm we created. In other words every order has a unique amount to be paid in a given timeframe. This is achievable due to the deep divisibility of crypto coins while having a negligible effect on the actual price.

You can test creating two orders for the same product and only paying for one and checking the correct order was automatically marked as paid inside of Woocommerce or easy digital downloads.

Then there is PIVX, Komodo, Decred and ARK which all offer some rewards. And DASH which pays out pretty big (if you can afford a $400k node).

Unfortunately, we are still too early in the passive income reward era of Crypto to say whether all these currencies will remain profitable, but I am seeing a bright future. The nodes I hold now for ZenCash give me similar profits as the mining rigs I set up in 2016/2017, and the pay off has been rising quite rapidly. I would put some time looking into PIVX, DASH, Komodo, Decred and ARK if you want to do your own research. And there is a lot of info on the [zencash subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/ZenSys/).

Bitcoin's security model is tested by billions of USD and years, LN's is not, until it is, I withhold any monetary judgements. For now it's not looking good enough for me to consider abandoning BCH even close

Bitcoin Cash is better than Litecoin, Vertcoin and other open blockchains cos it's more sound: more people involved, more people have coins, second biggest proof of work - attack is expensive, clear roadmap for keepers of its security model - Bitcoin miners

Bitcoin Cash is less immutable than BTC chain, but on the grand scheme of things their immutability marks are close on the scale. So better divisibility and portability becomes a deal-breaker",1524732445

First, congrats on finding your lost coins. It’s small, but it’s something :)

Second, you may want to look into mining. You can’t mine bitcoin with regular hardware anymore. But you could mine an alt coin (amd cards are great at ethereum, nvidia is great at zcash i think...). I’m on mobile so I can’t give links but there’s lots of subreddits about mining. If you’d like to start super easy there’s nicehash but people have varying opinions on that (they choose what you mine and you get paid in bitcoin).

If you want the money out, I’d convert to ETH or LTC and move it to GDAX and withdraw

"&gt; Yes, it's the MOST popular implementation so far, but using that for any other purpose than to say BTC is more popular than BCH would be an ad-populous fallacy.

I don't understand what you're trying to say with this statement.

&gt;If BTC is an implementation of the Bitcoin protocol, BCH also is. Why calling it an altcoin? If it's the same protocol and the same transaction history it's the same coin, only time will tell which of the two chains wins, it's all very clear on the white paper.

No, that's false. You're being misleading and it's irritating to have to navigate your deceptive language. 

&gt;If BTC is an implementation of the Bitcoin protocol

You just said, ""If Bitcoin is an implementation of the Bitcoin protocol"". That doesn't make any rational sense. You might as well be saying, ""If the moon is the moon, then a pinecone also is"". Do you see how this is nonsensical?

&gt;BCH also is. Why calling it an altcoin?

Bcash is an altcoin because it's not Bitcoin. That's the definition of an altcoin... any form of cryptocurrency which is not Bitcoin is an altcoin. Bcash is not Bitcoin, and therefore Bcash is an altcoin. 

&gt;If it's the same protocol 

It's not the same protocol. It's a completely incompatible protocol from Bitcoin and they have completely separate networks.

&gt;the same transaction history

As I said, the transaction history was copied from Bitcoin on August 1st 2017. They are not the same transaction history. Bcash transactions are not Bitcoin transaction.

&gt;it's the same coin

As explained previously, it's not the same coin and you're being intentionally ignorant of the facts laid out before you. 

&gt;only time will tell which of the two chains wins

Time has already told. The matter was settled within hours, or even days if we're being generous. Again, Bcash is not Bitcoin and Bcash will never be Bitcoin. Just like a fish will never be the moon. Please stop deluding yourself. 

&gt;it's all very clear on the white paper.

Completely ambiguous, faith-based statement.

&gt;Mostly by trolls, as BCash has several meanings, here in Brazil BCash is a relatively common way to pay for online stuff, much more accepted than BTC, but has nothing to do with crypto currency.

Here you are blaming Bitcoiners because the leaders of Bcash couldn't pick a creative name for their altcoin. You should blame the Bcash leaders for this problem instead. People who call the altcoin Bcash are doing everyone a favor by reducing confusion. 

&gt;Why not? The only breaks on transaction backward compatibilities were made to prevent wrong spends from a BTC address to a BCH inicio and vice versa.

That's literally what ""not compatible"" means. If you want, I can help you test this for yourself. You will see that you cannot send Bcash coins to the Bitcoin blockchain and you cannot send Bitcoins to the Bcash blockchain. That's what I mean when I say they're totally separate.

&gt;Except they aren't, same protocol, same technology, same block chain,

NO. Please stop repeating the same stupid statements that are easily disproven. Flat Earth mentality is absolutely not welcome here. 

&gt;the paper predicts this sort of works as the way to upgrade the technology, 

Thank you for demonstrating your lack of understanding so plainly. Please do us both a favor and go back and read past the abstract. Satoshi is describing PoW not as a method to hijack the protocol, but as a method for resolving differences in *transaction ordering*. Obviously Satoshi understood that miners do not rule Bitcoin. 

&gt;if only one chain remains on the long run that chain becomes Bitcoin, while two exists they're two different Bitcoin implementations.

Here you are acknowledging that Bitcoin is in fact Bitcoin, and then trying to pretend that a fish is the moon. Stop being ridiculous. That's not how blockchains work at all. 

&gt; This sort of split also can happen without a fork of the code but by mere chance.

You do realize that Bcash forked more than just the code right? They forked the entire blockchain to a new altcoin. Does that make sense to you? I will reiterate that Flat Earth mentality won't be tolerated. ",1524731960

Crypto isn’t meant to be an intermediary currency, otherwise no one would hold it. As much as i don’t like to say this, don’t ever pay in crypto unless it is for something that is genuinely priced in that crypto (price doesn’t change every 5mins depending on fx rate).

&gt; The most people around the world will be trading and mining bitcoin at this point in time, using the Facebook software. Facebook can make changes as they prefer.

What? Number of users does NOT determine the rules (UASF anyone?), that's why we have miners, the entire design of Bitcoin is to prevent exactly this from happening. The miners themselves would have to switch to FB mining software and then ""upgrade"" to their overt take-over version of it, a virtual impossibility.

&gt; In case of fedcoins a blockchain will record every transaction just like in Bitcoin. But the only difference is instead of being connected by a network of friends, this ledger system will be managed by banking institutions certified by the Federal Reserve. “These authorized nodes could be things like Bank of America, JP Morgan, and any trusted institutions,” Gupta said

FED already has its centralized shitcoin, it's called USD and it's working exactly as described, adding ""blockchain"" to it would not make a zilch of a difference, in fact, it would make it **less** efficient so it makes exactlyzero sense.
