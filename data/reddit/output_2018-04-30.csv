"This short paper examines the tail behaviour of the returns of five major cryptocurrencies. By employing an extreme analysis and estimating Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall as tail risk measures, they found that Bitcoin Cash is the riskiest, while Bitcoin and Litecoin are the least risky cryptocurrencies.  They also concluded that Bitcoin Cash has the highest potential gain.",1525157996
"One of us is confused.  When you move crypto to the BitPay card, they convert it entirely at that time into fiat.  When the card is used, there is no crypto involved, it is just using the fiat.

So if I load $100 worth of crypto onto the card, there is a confirmation for that deposit.  Once that confirmed, that is the end of the crypto processing.

I can make several charges on the card in quick succession, up to the $100 limit.  No crypto is involved in the use of the card.  There is no delay waiting on blockchain confirmations.",1525157893

Yesterday this was posted on the CC sub:

Are both definitions just taking a different angle?

"&gt; Because 1000 hobby nodes could easily equal 2 server nodes in quality and it's pretty useless ta talk decentralization if we don't consider quality.

Quality has got nothing to do with it. Full node is full node.

&gt; Keeping those hobbits node will come with a huge tax on the network.

How?

&gt; Basically you can not scale if you are bootstrapping the network to work with a minimum requirement of equipment to run a node.

Sure you can. There are many ways to scale. Bitcoin just doesn't scale well on-chain without losing decentralization. There is still much to be done for on-chain scaling as well (schnorr, MAST, a small inctease to block size limit if/when meeded). Offchain hiwever Bitcoin can scale without losing it's most omportant properties.

Two on the most important properties of Bitcoin are decentralization and it's ability to survive everything. If network operators decide to limit bandwith or attack bitcoin in some other way or the underlying technologies collapse due to war or some other disaster, bitcoin will survive because ppl will still be able to run nodes. Whereas if the blockchain were to grow so huge that running nodes would require datacentres, those centres could be bought, bombed, hacked or attacked in many ways. Also that kind of Bitcoin would be controlled by the rich elite. Just as Fiat is. Fiat works because governments with armies are backing it. Bitcoin doesn't need governments or armies because it's decentralized!

It's all about decentralization. Without that, Bitcoin isn't Bitcoin. It should be taken seriously.

"Thanks for your attempt, I was seriously getting bored. Excuse me for saying this but your attempt seems like its driven by emotions, not real knowledge \- I will prove this soon but never the less you are trying so thank you. 

I will simply ignore your first statement ""So its just a bank ledger"". It is beyond my intelligence and I will take it as your opinion as that's what it really is. 

Let's talk about incentive to uphold the network next. The incentive to uphold this network is literally exactly the same as the incentive to uphold any network.  Why is BTC or any other coin being hosted\(as you call it\)? Because of miner fees? Yes? XRP uses PoS I am sure you know that and the incentive to keep the network up comes from XRP's own value \- whatever it ends up being and for having a say in the validations, keeping your own record and helping decentralise an asset you have decided to use based on its technical merit over everything else for your specific use\-case. This is why a lot of major companies are now taking on running nodes for XRP, to help validate an asset they have picked. Same as you don't run full nodes to mine Bitcoin, if you knew that.

""What is the difference aside from the asset used in that company was actual USD"" \- Honestly is that actually a question? I am hoping you must be going somewhere with this so I will try and answer. I am not sure how technical you are, but I presume you understand what a ledger actually is? like its not rocket science blockchain, and better tech will soon follow even updated versions and those stuck with mining for transactions etc. might be well stuck. Bitcoin literally was trying to follow what P2P bittorrents do, and hence the ledger \- all it really is a distributed nodes of fancy database if you like. PoW vs PoS is a different debate, and based on practical aspects alone you and me both will see what wins, its clear. Back to the ledger, the ledger requires a digital asset, it can be any crypto or anything you can create \- But USD can't be used as is, maybe a form of IOU type digital one can \- but to get the speed of 1 sec post COBALT or current 4 sec for settlements and to get the TPS and scalability \- this USD that you so want Ripple to use will be a USD on steroids that will share all the code XRP token has to make it run the same on the Ledger, so you are basically back to what ripple created to run fastest on the ledger XRP. Call it whatever you like, we need an asset with similar speeds to use this ledger the best and settle fastest and scale highest more that any, any ledger out there \- feel free to confirm this.

Your next statements are very ignorant and show your knowledge vs emotions in its great strength at work. Let's start with first claim. 

""Just because ledger function is open source does not make it crypto ""dude""""

""Dude"" I don't know if you actually tried or just were getting bored towards the end, but where did I or anyone or Ripple even claim that being open source makes you a crypto? I stated as that is something the general public currently thinks is the first thing, you must be open source. Technically it means nothing, whether its a ledger or not is what the code and actual software and its implementation decides. 

""There is no blockchain, there is no decentralisation, there is no POW, there is no value, there is no crypto"" ""You seem bright, stop wasting your time"". 

Thanks for trying to help me out here. Let's start with some technical discussion now, if you can comprehend \- seems like you just basically think anything that doesn't use PoW is not crypto. That's what your statement reads. 

Pow And PoS are two algorithms, look them up. If you understand computer science. I will tell you something blunt and simple, I can create 20 more algorithms like that \- if some greedy lot starts picking just one for their incentive to make some token then convert it to actual USD or FIAT that they feed other fools, they want to destroy as fools keeps buying their token \- does not mean that on technical merit the other 19 algorithms to run ledgers are in your language shit. No, infact they may be now better as version 2 but the Greedy lot that got in first wants to keep making money on their equipment and all the capital costs and will say to the world and even hire people to say for them that anything that is not the algo they are using, is not a crypto. This is literally what PoW vs PoS is. Practically speaking PoW is not long term sustainable, sooner the govt bans, the better for us. 

""XRP is not a crypto dude, walk on.""

 Please, please educate yourself a bit more, beyond the coins you are invested in purely to gain FIAT profit\(You know the fiat some of you want to destroy, yet every year keep taking your profits to\). Talk about things you actually technically know about or please learn before you post for others to read. How do you claim there is no blockchain? do you know what a blockchain is? Yes there is a blockchain, and that's why there are validators or nodes. Blockchain for people reading is literally just a distributed database where all nodes or validators do the validation or node\-check. Thats it. Forget what guys like this say \- because they obviously know absolutely nothing about it in technical terms. Here is a bit more info, [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/ripple\-cryptocurrency.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/ripple-cryptocurrency.asp) if you are genuinely interested i will send you a paper by a university who conducted research into the crypto XRP \- although not being used by Ripple's first usecase for anything other than settlements for now \- FOR NOW.

""XRP is not decentralised"" 

XRP itself is decentralised just because of the validators and nodes run by companies other than Ripple, it needs just 17 more to be technically and practically more decentralised than bitcoin and ether both. FACT. 

Initially not as much as XRP should be decentralised agreed, as Ripple held control and I would have as well to keep their project going as intended, now as per above they are fully letting it go. 

""GTFO, Crypto is not for you""

Ok thanks for your advice, I think you should stay in with me here and let's educate each other a bit more, do you have any more questions on real technical merit to discuss or just more of your own opinions and misinformation you have chosen to believe now forcing on others?

I agree with anyone that says that today's XRP price is not based on real use. No it is not, it is 100&amp;#37; speculative price but same as any other coin, show me a coin whom's value is based on real world volume usage? But with XRP the goal and aim for me atleast is long term, and I will happily stay till facts start pointing elsewise and that's when I move my bags. ",1525156289

"&gt; then what is the optimum today?

Segwit, schnorr and blocks that aren't full, which is dynamic. There's no static number that will satisfy this question. Right now 1mb is working perfectly fine.

&gt;you said it was calculable and easily subjected to concensus. 

Reasonable fees and open blocks. Segwit adoption. Mining consensus. I'm not going to repeat myself again. It's not my problem that you seemingly can't understand most of this stuff or how it all comes together. 

&gt;and do i need to cite all the devs who DO think one is needed? 

No, that's my point. Why are you just rambling off names? It's not an argument. One of those people is lead developer for Core and you can't even see how moronic that makes you appear.

&gt;you're wrong, why can't you admit this?

Uh, okay? I guess that must be true because you say it's true. 

&gt;core devs should have thought of this before they dared us to fork BCH off.

Lol, dared you to fork? Anyone can fork at any time. I can fork it right now if I want to. The fact that BCH did it was just stupid but ultimately inconsequential as time has shown. 

&gt;oh, now they're mad. facepalm.

Only about users getting scammed from Bitcoin.com and the likes of shills such as yourself. Not because of the fork or the tech itself. I can assure you BCH serves no threat to BTC. 

&gt;that was the choice offered by the BCH devs. they weren't afraid to be rejected by the market if it happened. but it hasn't. too bad for BTC.

Your right, it hasn't, but I think you're confusing why that's the case. It's only trading because everyone on the BTC network got a dividend on Aug 1 and why not trade something if you have it? It's a big bubble, just like the vast majority of alts. The only things that really have intrinsic value are BTC, LTC, XMR and maybe a few others. The rest is just centralized and redundant garbage, including BCH. 

&gt;concensus was a stupid concept invented by the likes of Greg and Luke.

God, I can't even believe your argument has degraded to this.

&gt;how convenient b/c all it took was for one of those two fools to disagree with the blocksize increase that the majority of the community wanted as evidenced by ~6 different forum polls conducted in 2015. concensus is only appropriate to them when it fits their preconceived agendas.

Complete mis-framing of the situation. You can spin ""consensus"" but you ignore the fact of how PoW works. If BCH were better than the network and developers (and market) would reflect that. Instead, it pales in comparison to BTC and shows no signs of flippening or anything close. Pure delusion to think the charts or fundamentals look good for BCH in any regard.

&gt;please continue to bury your head in the sand.

Ok, you must be trolling. No way that somebody can think BCH has a healthy upward trajectory and ignore all evidence to the contrary.

then what is the optimum today?  will you answer the question?  you said it was calculable and easily subjected to concensus.  how stupid.

&gt;Do you really need to me to cite all the devs that don't think it's needed at this time.

and do i need to cite all the devs who DO think one is needed?  you said this was all calculable and easy to obtain concensus.  you're wrong, why can't you admit this?  

&gt; How are you supposed to use a coin when there are two opposing chains operating in parallel?

core devs should have thought of this before they dared us to fork BCH off.  oh, now they're mad.  facepalm.

as well, one chain will eventually die.  but it takes time for the market to figure out which one b/c of the inertia with BTC.  that was the choice offered by the BCH devs.  they weren't afraid to be rejected by the market if it happened.  but it hasn't.  too bad for BTC.

&gt;This is completely fucking retarded and breaks the entire concept of consensus. All this does is weaken the network of the consensus coin and create disarray for users. 

concensus was a stupid concept invented by the likes of Greg and Luke.  how convenient b/c all it took was for one of those two fools to disagree with the blocksize increase that the majority of the community wanted as evidenced by ~6 different forum polls conducted in 2015.  concensus is only appropriate to them when it fits their preconceived agendas.

"Btc seem to strive towards equality, it lets everyone run a raspberry pi node. It's nice for hobbyists but it will not add much to decentralization. Because 1000 hobby nodes could easily equal 2 server nodes in quality and it's pretty useless ta talk decentralization if we don't consider quality. Keeping those hobbits node will come with a huge tax on the network. Basically you can not scale if you are bootstrapping the network to work with a minimum requirement of equipment to run a node.

"Hello Thane. Yes i am aware of your half hearted due diligence attempts to verify certain information in regards to the auditor and accounting firm. My name is Saransh Sharma and I am the president of 4NEW. Firstly, I cant begin to fathom what motive someone would even have to lie about their auditor or accountant. 99% of the ICOs out there don't even highlight this information. We chose to do so because it is true. Furthermore, to answer your question about why we have accountants and auditors in the US, the case point is very simple. We are in the midst of purchasing a publicly listed company in an effort to create the world's first crypto/stock hybrid. This is deep financial engineering that most average folks cant even begin to wrap their minds around. A reality in which a stock/crypto hybrid can exist. Consequently, SEC requires the public companies be audited by US accounting firms. So while all ICOs are running away from US jurisdiction, we are one of the guys heading towards it. Nevertheless, your naivety and swiftness to allegate strong accusations is rather immature. The reason you were blocked from the group was because you distinctly stated that you wouldnt be purchasing anything. Despite that you came into the group with a subversive tone. Furthermore, I suggested a phone dialogue and you denied, perhaps because you didnt want to hear the other side. You already had a version of events in mind that you wanted to sell on this thread to mislead and misguide other members. Anyways, to each their own. I wish you all the best. Should you have any further questions, I will be thrilled to address them here for you and the group. However, last I checked the world still operated as innocent until proven guilty. And from your feeble due diligence efforts and as an officer of the court that you are, it is sad that this moral impunction was ignored by you.

Also, when you open an account with an auditor or an accounting firm, KYC is required. Same is true if you are trying to form a company. Therefore, it isnt out of the ordinary that an individual be pegged to the account to manage a relationship when dealing with corporate affairs. I would try to spin any kind of benign conspiracy theories on this front. Moreover, if you actually browsed the website carefully, you'd find me still on the website. Therefore, your allegation about the president having been removed is simply not true.

And in regards to the technical the lead, he is the one that developed our token. He is a busy guy and may have forgotten to add this. However, he has certainly attained my reference for additional clients that he has procured as a consequence. Once again, your due diligence and alleged evidence is circumstantial at best.",1525153914
"The other two responses you've received sum it up pretty well. Fact is Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash are BOTH Bitcoin, and people have different opinions about which one is more deserving of the name.

This is why Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin, because the developers who stole their authority chose to make BTC something else.",1525153818
"&gt; What do you mean by the above?

you said 1MB is ideal.  i provided you plenty of counter opinions from experts that disagree.  i forgot to add pwuille who advocated a relatively aggressive blocksize schedule increase over several years via a hard fork.  who's right?

b/c you can't acknowledge that there's experts who disagree with your 1MB blocksize optimum, you instead deflected with a goalspost shift to the general question of whether an increase is even needed; despite plenty of counter opinions that think one is needed.

&gt;How? Do you still not understand how consensus works? 

i do in fact.  this is where intellectually disabled folks like you hurt Bitcoin.  concensus is not something achievable before the fact.  it is achieved after the fact.  i'll spell it out for you, so listen carefully:  it's not possible to obtain concensus for difficult issues, like the blocksize debate, ahead of a fork.  this is b/c too many people have too many opinions.  even corrupt opinions based on a financial agenda.  thus, a hard fork needs to be executed to offer the community two choices, in this case, BCH or BTC.  only then, over time, will concensus be achieved on one chain or the other.  we're at the very beginning of that process.",1525153727

Here's the [source on that](https://blog.bitmex.com/the-segwit-transaction-capacity-increase-update/), because we know how important data is to you. 

&gt;1. hasn't happened. you guys claimed BCH couldn't handle a spam attack;

Who said that?

&gt;you claimed a hard fork blocksize increase would die immediately;

I never said that. **Show me the data on that, broski**. Or are you just talking out your ass?

"Very good video! Contains a bunch of key information. I took the time to break it down for those that don't have the time to watch the whole thing:

[0:34] The failure of Segwit2X may be the most important historical event in Bitcoin so far.

--

[12:16] Segwit only passed miner votes due to the promise of Segwit2X (1MB-&gt;2MB blocks).

[12:46] Segwit only had ~35% of support but got ~90% after the promise of Segwit2X.

[8:25] However Segwit2X never happened due to a very local minority that were attacking anybody that supported it (ridicule, low ratings, DDOS).

[10:55] Those that had agreed to switch over to Segwit2X broke the deal due to fear of what might happen.

[9:58] There were actual lists of ""enemies of Bitcoin"" that everybody should denounce.

--

[14:52] Social media's influencial power should be recognized.

--

[17:35] The old Bitcoin community have gathered around Bitcoin Cash.

[20:36] Gavin Andresen is interested in Bitcoin Cash (Satoshi made Andresen his successor in late 2010).

--

[23:46] Scaling with larger maximum block sizes was Satoshi's plan.

[25:26] If Bitcoin was invented for the purpose of being a ""store of value"" it would never have taken off.

--

[28:55] Bitcoin Cash is ahead of Bitcoin in merchant adoption.

[27:48] Some companies accept BCH exclusively.

[28:18] However we've not yet surpassed what BTC adoption used to be.

[28:33] Since the high fees of BTC made many merchants abandon crypto completely.

--

[29:32] BCH support from BitPay adds a lot of legitimacy for Bitcoin Cash since it's one of (if not THE) oldest Bitcoin companies.

--

[35:34] The upcoming hard fork update (May 15) will be the second hard fork for BCH (or third if you count the creation hard fork).

[35:52] There has been a lot of new proposals for scaling and innovating BCH.

[38:34] Scaling up to 32 MB blocks is easy and safe because it requires no changes in the communication protocols and...

[41:44] ...hardware or bandwidth should be sufficient for most people interested in running a full node.

[44:30] Instead of sending blocks around as giant messages some type of streaming protocol could be used.

--

[45:27] Ansible is a suggestion on how to make 0-conf transactions more secure (no details on what it actually is in the video).

[46:34] 0-conf is already very secure for small payments since there is a cost associated with even trying to double spend.

[46:42] The removal of replace-by-fee from BCH means that double spend attempts are not re-broadcasted by nodes.

[48:51] One way of making 0-conf more secure: Miners pass around ""weak blocks"" created by high Proof-of-Work (just not high enough to be an actual block), if a transaction is found in one of these ""weak blocks"" it proves that a transaction has a high chance to be included in the next actual block.

--

[52:43] Having a social network on-chain is feasible.

[53:55] Don't think too much about whether or not something will instantly scale to the entire world, technology will increase alongside adoption.

[55:10] Sometimes you need to sacrifice a tiny bit of security for a big chunk of efficiency because perfect security is an illusion (ideas that are just ""good enough"" aren't automatically bad).

--

[57:18] It's important to keep the centralization concerns in mind when raising the block sizes.

[58:21] But it's not a concern we need to worry about today with 32 MB blocks, it should not hinder progress.

[59:28] The value increase that large blocks bring to a crypto is more than the increase of a node's operating cost.

--

[1:01:07] It's important to keep an eye on who's mining Bitcoin Cash to check for centralization issues.

[1:02:09] Miners don't want more than 50% of the hashrate because they know the damage it would cause to the crypto's value when discovered.

[1:01:44] Both BTC and BCH do not currently have a problem with &gt;50% of the hashrate belonging to a single group of people.

--

[1:06:23] Many developers contribute to Bitcoin Cash.

[1:08:53] This isn't just Roger Ver's pet project.

--

[1:12:01] It might be possible for BTC and BCH to coexist in the future, though it's more likely for one to die out since people tend to want to use one medium of exchange.

[1:13:54] Bitcoin Cash is more stable because of its more frequent difficulty adjustment. BTC could become unusable if a lot of miners switched over to BCH at the same time.

[1:18:20] Right now BTC is the most secure blockchain - it has the most mining power and it is the most costly chain to try and double spend on.

[1:18:45] But that could change very quickly due to a number of things.

[1:16:25] BTC might live on as a store of value only due to social convention.

--

[1:19:06] Switching between different crypto currencies is so easy nowadays that the ""one currency to rule them all""-idea has lost some weight.

--

[1:20:40] There is a threat of a bunch of angry BTC miners banding together and using their hashrate to mess with the BCH blockchain.

[1:21:22] The very quick difficulty adjustment of BCH helps mitigate the damage.

[1:22:00] Such an attack would be expensive, the attacker(s) would need to gain more from double spending on BCH than simply continuing to mine on BTC.

[1:23:23] If the BCH network was compromised in such a way it would also harm the reputation of BTC since they both use the same underlying technology.

[1:24:22] A truly malicious actor (a government for example) would find it a lot cheaper to attack the BCH network at its current size.

--

[1:25:23] Lightning Network is interesting tech with use cases but it is not the only way to scale Bitcoin.

[1:26:07] Lightning Network has several problems.

[1:26:29] The recipient needs to be online.

[1:27:03] You need to lock up money to make a channel. Locking up much larger amounts than needed for a single payment is encouraged.

[1:28:37] Nobody knows how routing will work.

[1:29:33] When LN was first introduced the idea was that it should be used exclusively for micro payments.

[1:29:46] There's a risk of losing funds on LN if you're not online and monitoring them.

[1:30:07] There's an idea to put another system on top of LN called ""Watchtowers"" to monitor your funds for you while you are offline.

[1:30:23] We already had a way to use crypto as cash before LN came around.

and i already asked you to back that up with hard concrete calculations, not just some quote from a conflicted LN dev (Poon).  and i also asked you for a number that applies today.  bottom line:  you have no fucking idea.  just that you want to continue to cripple the network at some magical number of 1MB, which bears no ties with reality or what Satoshi said we should do.

no, i won't dare.  and here's where core trolls like you misunderstand the big block argument:  we admit that no one can calculate the optimum blocksize today or tomorrow b/c it's the human condition to disagree.  kinda like we're doing right now but has also played out so obviously the last 3y in the Bitcoin space.  given that realization and acceptance of mature people like me in the space (and unlike you) we recommend the simple and most straightforward solution to this impasse.  which is to lift the limit, as Satoshi said, and let the market figure it out.  miners will not bloat blocksizes in that scenario b/c they want to avoid orphaning and have no interest in jamming the network up which would undermine their substantial investments.  we've already seen them not bloat/spam blocks the last 9y well before 1MB limit was hit.  so why would they change their behavior with 8MB?  in fact, they haven't as BCH has so well demonstrated. you clowns predicted the 8MB would get spammed full on day 1.  hasn't happened.  you guys claimed BCH couldn't handle a spam attack; it's fended off ~3 incidents already.  you claimed a hard fork blocksize increase would die immediately; it did not.  how many times do we big blockists have to prove you wrong?

"Thats funny, because I speculate on stocks and invest in crypto. 

I don't know why this comes up so much and is always a top comment when someone uses the word ""invest,"" but... speculation is a form of investment, and investments are often speculative. They're not opposing ideas, they just imply different things. In the **stock market**, investing implies a lower risk, but also implies that you're going to hold the asset for a much longer time. Speculation implies a higher risk and a plan to sell it shortly after an increase in value. But in **real life** people use the word invest much more broadly. Take the definition if the word invest:

&gt;invest

&gt;[in-vest]

&gt;verb

&gt;to put (money) to use, by purchase or expenditure, in something offering potential profitable returns, as interest, income, **or appreciation in value.**

(my emphasis)

&gt;to use (money), as in accumulating something: 

My purchases of bitcoin satisfy both of these definitions.

&gt;*to invest large sums in books.*

So if I take the bus every day, but then I decide I should just pay up front for a bicycle and save money in the long run, I could say I'm investing in a bicycle. The bicycle doesn't generate any revenue or pay dividends... but I'm not using the wrong the word. If you say I'm using the wrong word because the bicycle doesn't produce cash flow, then you're the one who is using the word in the wrong context.

Now let's look at speculate:

&gt;speculate

&gt;[spek-yuh-leyt]

&gt;verb

&gt;to engage in any business transaction involving considerable risk or the chance of large gains, especially to buy and sell commodities, stocks, etc., in the expectation of a quick or very large profit.

So buying stocks that generate cash flow can be considered speculation if it's risky, which is completely arbitrary and subjective. 

So if you don't really give a shit about crypto, but you think it's gonna go up in value in the short term so you buy a bunch to sell to some sucker at the peak, then it makes more sense to say you're speculating. If the only reason you 're buying bitcoin is to turn some amount of dollars into a larger amount of dollars, then it makes more sense to say your speculating (which is still a form of investment). There are a lot of people here who are just speculating. They don't use bitcoin, they don't buy it often, they might not even like it. They might even *dislike* it. But they think they can flip it quick for a bunch of fiat. They're speculating.

But if you're someone who actually thinks bitcoin has value and plans on holding it for as long as you possiblity can, if you use it for your **savings**, or if you've been buying it for years and never sold any and replace what you spend, or if you wouldn't sell it no matter how far it dropped to ""cut your losses,"" or if you have no interest in ever trading it for dollars and you just hope to be rich in bitcoin some day, then it makes more sense to say that you are invested in it, in the literal definition of the word. Sure, there is still *some* level of speculation going on because it's high risk and high reward, but investment is the more accurate word in this case.

Whether you're speculating or investing depends on your strategy.",1525152802

"That is not evidence of a mistake in his understanding. Work proof over time cannot be measured directly in a distributed and trustless manner. Bitcoin relies on the output of its SHA256d-based CSPRNG to approximate the quantity of work performed in the discovery of blocks. By time the client relies on block height for determining which of two chains contains more work proof, it has already validated that the block each contains have met the difficulty requirements which give rise the unit of approximate work. As the timing information required to be included in blocks by the protocol is too lax to provide sufficient resolution at the per-block level, the sum of blockcount and difficulty factor, the latter of which is consistent between the two chains, becomes the most appropriate approximation of work performed over the duration between the discovery of the blocks in question.

It is both reasonable and valid within the abilities of the Bitcoin system to use block height as a proxy in comparing work proof, so long as the chains share common difficulty requirements and their blocks have already been validated against them. It is only when two chains do not share a difficulty requirements that use of their block heights is no longer sufficient for comparison of their work proof, and a more complete value must be calculated.

This computational shortcut that you label an error is still in use by clients descended from Satoshi's original. Even the dominate Bitcoin Cash client makes the same assumption of block height, and it can do so because it has already normalized the blocks against its expected difficulty requirements. If this shortcut indeed was an error, certainly you should have little difficult demonstrating when and how it was corrected.",1525152529

"As a coin on its own, it works fine.  However, now that Bitcoin fees are very low again it doesn't have much of an upside, and you could have always used LTC for the exact same thing, also for a negligible fee.  The reason a lot of people don't like it is because of the characters that publicly support it and the way that they support, mainly Roger Ver and the company Bitmain.  

A popular complaint is that they decided to rip off the Bitcoin name for their new coin, which easily confuses people who are new to crypto.  If they picked an original name and didn't try to be ""the real Bitcoin"" people would be a lot less upset.  Also, while larger blocks lower transaction fees in times of high volume, they reduce decentralization because larger blocks mean it's harder to run a node, meaning fewer companies doing it.

Personally, I think the BCH camp should have either just made a different coin or found ways to reconcile their differences with the Bitcoin community before doing a hard fork.  Also, Bitmain forced everyone to use BCH to buy miners for like a half a year, which forced almost everyone who wanted to mine Bitcoin to buy BCH.  When it was only available on small random exchanges, it was a huge pain in the ass to buy quickly and easily.  I'd venture to guess that was one of the main reasons it didn't die out.  So many people were trying to buy it because they wanted to get on the mining train that exchanges eventually started supporting it.  It was a smart move on their part, but it only fueled everyone's love-hate relationship with Bitmain who profited tremendously from the whole thing.",1525150885

I personally wouldn't call a solution like Bitflyer to Bitflyer payments a bad interim solution while people are still in the process of adopting Bitcoin/crypto.  
  
The main idea is to move from a trust system to a trust-less one.   We live in a world where everything is setup around trust systems, so we have to transition from one setup and mindset to another.  
This doesn't go equally simple for everyone.  

So in my opinion while we are making trust-less transactions be as ""convenient"" as the ones everyone is currently used to through 3rd parties like Pay-Pal/Visa.  
There should be ways that let people go about their crypto in the same way as those 3rd parties let them do it even though that means using these ""trusted"" 3rd parties for now.  

If people are already using crypto even before we can transact as conveniently in trust-less ways as we do through 3rd parties, then they will have much easier time transitioning to the trust-less solutions without having to get used to handling crypto first.  

I guess what I'm trying to say is that these kind of solutions help the adoption for the general public as simply owning (a little bit of) crytpo even if it is on an exchange gives reason to learn more about what it is you own and spark questions and conversations about crypto.  

While the general public still learns more about crypto, in the meantime the crypto developers can move things forward into making real trust-less solutions equally convenient.  ",1525149412

No, I'm not denying that there's been extensive debate of this topic. Keep strawmanning me though, it's a good look. Remember, you're the one pretending that BTC is centralized, stuck at 1mb blocksize and that LN is viable. You're living in a fantasy if you believe any of those things.

&gt;Point being there will never be an agreed upon definition so we might as well just continue what has been successful the last 9y which is having a block limit well above blocksize.

This is the dumbest logic ever. Firstly the limit was only instituted once and it was by Satoshi. We haven't continually raised the blocksize limit, so not sure what you're smoking but you're off your rocker. Also, this requires a hard fork, which as you can see is a contentious issue when consensus doesn't follow. 

&gt;You're an idiot of the nth degree thinking you can control what you cannot and risking Bitcoins success on a stupid theoretical overlay that isn't working.

LN *is* working, derp. [1800 nodes and counting](https://lnmainnet.gaben.win/). I guess if you want to just spread baseless FUD then you're doing a good job but you're clearly just another disingenuous shill, pretending that things are as they're not.

"Thats funny, because I speculate on stocks and invest in crypto. 

I don't know why this comes up so much and is always a top comment when someone uses the word ""invest,"" but... speculation is a form of investment, and investments are often speculative. They're not opposing ideas, they just imply different things. In the **stock market**, investing implies a lower risk, but also implies that you're going to hold the asset for a much longer time. Speculation implies a higher risk and a plan to sell it shortly after an increase in value. But in **real life** people use the word invest much more broadly. Take the definition if the word:

&gt;invest

&gt;[in-vest]

&gt;verb (used with object)

to put (money) to use, by purchase or expenditure, in something offering potential profitable returns, as interest, income, or appreciation in value.

"So should I be looking at the market value of cryptocurrencies as a whole and not the coins individually? I'm saying that based on your statement that when a better coin comes along, there will be a transfer of market capitalisation from old to new.

When it comes to creators of cryptocurrency and fraud claims; is that possible to do with Bitcoin, whose creator is 'unknown'?

From what I'm seeing, the only advantage that bitcoin has is first movers advantage. And even though their are coins out there that have better technology or systems behind it, and have stronger regulation, it still holds the highest value simply due to first movers.

"Because settling Visa is from the merchants perspective. I am talking about the user perspective. No user ever is going to switch from using his credit card to Bitcoin if it means waiting longer then before. 

And they won't switch either if they belief that using Bitcoin instanly is unsafe. And if they don't swich first and have reasons to want to spend Bitcoins in stores then merchants have nothing to gain by accepting it. 

Marketing needs to go towards users first. Then merchants next. 

If a user is going to think: Oh I have not paid yet, it takes 10 minues before I have paid. Well I don't want user to think that.

I want user to do the BCH transaction and then not worry about anything else and the same with the merchant. 

People don't worry about paying with cash or with their credit cards unless the amount is very large, like over a 1000 dollars. Then it's time to start worrying, for the average person. 

For anything under a 1000 dollars, 0 conf is from a user perspective a 100%. From a merchants perspective it only needs to be more safe then visa and mastercard and cheaper.

But you don't want users to believe that they can make payments, take the good and then once in a  while get lucky and get their money back. And we don't want them to ask merchants questions that they can't awnser. Like why is this called 0-conf? Why zero? What is a confirmation? Am I paying without anybody confirming it? Etc etc. 

It's not a problem for now, but 20 years from now. Better start getting people used to the language that works the best for them. Don't hassle your users when you don't have too.

"Well there are a few different categories of cryptos. First you have your currency only coins like bitcoin, I would say the value of these is solely what people are willing to pay for it, at least for right now, when we get more mass adoption of being able to actually use them in everyday purchases then that will create more demand. They do have some benefits over regular currencies, like they can be sent to anyone in the world fast and almost free without a middle man, they are scarce in supply and can't be created out of thin air, they must be mined. 

Then you have platform coins like Ethereum. Ethereum has smart contracts which allow people to build decentralized applications (dapps). In the ethereum network, the eth is used as ""gas"" to pay for computation on the network. So anyone who creates a dapp, must then pay eth to execute every line of code. That creates demand for the eth.

Then you have coins that pay dividends in a way, like Neo. Neo is similar to Ethereum in that it has smart contracts but holding Neo generates you a certain amount of gas which is a separate tradeable coin.

Then you have utility tokens, which is a token that is needed to perform certain functions in the dapp. For example a lot of erc20 tokens are utility tokens. Eth could also be technically considered a utility token. These tokens must be used to access functions in the applications that means that the more usage the applications get the more demand for these tokens.

I'm sure I'm forgetting some categories but those are the basic ones I can recall off the top of my head.",1525147553

What are they supported by: Decentralized cryptos are supported by the people like you and me. Centralized ones by the firms creating them.

How does they work: As each crypto is different, you will have to understand them separately. Broadly, currency based cryptos are like electronic payment systems. Platform based cryptos are like computer operating systems. Utility based cryptos are like different services provided by different companies.

"Simply stated, nothing has any value unless people value it, and want to exchange it for something that people value.

Uncut diamonds might be mistaken for aquarium gravel, and valued as cheaply.  And yet there are people who will pay millions of dollars for uncut diamonds, indeed that is how they are sold to diamond cutters.

Fiat currencies acquire their value because they are established by law as legal tender.  When a government breaks faith with its responsible fiscal  obligations and just prints more and more money, hyperinflation results, so that each dollar or whatever is valued less.

Parallel laws may forbid any private entity from minting its own money, and may restrict payment by other than legal tender.  But cryptocurrencies rather do an end run around this for the moment, because they are considered by the SEC to be securities, or by the CFTC to be commodities.

Basically we are talking about a system of barter here, where you might exchange your crypto commodity for other good, services, or sold for cash or exchanged for other cryptocurrencies.  And the value is derived from two things.  

First, a network effect, where if many people have adopted it as a presumed store of value, it is presumed to have value.  That may sound circular, but that is the dynamic in operation.

Second, inherent in the issuance of a cryptocurrency is a sort of contract.  Representations are made about ultimate supply, whether the cryptocurrency is created ad hoc in an ICO, or generated by the labor of so -called miners under a predetermined protocol and structured schedule.  Unlike a government, that cannot be sued if it suddenly starts to print more money, if the creator of a cryptocurrency tried to do the same thing they might be subject to a fraud claim.  This tends to give people confidence, more than in a fiat currency, that if they put their trust in those representations, and value a cryptocurrency on that basis, that the perceived value they are holding will not be diluted.

It matters not whether miners are burning electricity.  There is nothing to prevent someone else from coming along, or nearly 1600 people coming along and saying they have a better idea and better replacement.  That is, there may be limits on what the supply of an individual cryptocurrency might be, but there are not practical limits on how many different cryptocoins might be created.

Which leads us to the heart of the matter.  What you are really investing in when you buy a cryptocurrency is TECHNOLOGY.  If new coins are introduced that effectively solve the scaling problem, demonstrate fast confirmation times, etc., still open problems, previous generation coins will lose value and market capitalization will be transferred dramatically.  Nothing depreciates faster than obsolete technology.  Keep your eyes open, your ears to the ground and stay tuned.",1525146641

There's no reason not to take it.  There's also no reason not to take Dash, or NEM, or Monero or dozens of other coins.  There's already processors like coinpayments.net that will accept over 100 different coins and pay you out in the one you prefer for 0.5%, and with blocknet or other dex platforms that could be reduced to practically zero.

"A hardfork is when you change the consensus rules. This means that people that don't update their software to the new rules won't be able to still connect to the network of the people that have updated their software. 

So if there are Bitcoin Cash miners after may 15th that have no updated their mining software ... they will get errors and if they don't want to lose money they will update so they can mine again.

Users that don't mine use Simple Payment Verificication and don't need to do anything. Businesses that run full nodes but don't mine will also have to update or they will be stuck on the network still on old rules. That network will quickly become smaller and smaller forcing everybody to also update.

"Hm, i was thinking more about long term wealth preservation than any sort of immediate utility in a crisis. Bitcoin is built on top of a new and rather fragile infrastructure, which can conceivably be rendered inoperable by events far less than a worldwide disaster. 

Simple one can be near-war tensions permanently fragmenting the internet across many blocks and borders. A bit less likely would be the backdoors in modern CPUs leaking and being used to destroy a large portion of computers, also fragmenting the internet as well as killing the majority of nodes. A different sort of an event would be a CME strong enough to knock out the power for a large fraction of the world.

In many scenarios we have technological regress and/or economic collapse without necessarily having a shortage of food and water, followed by a recovery. Once things get back to normal, Bitcoin would be a thing of a past or a bunch of half-dead forks of questionable value and utility, while gold would maintain something close to it's previous value.

"&gt;""The purpose of LN is not for $20+ payments""

If im not mistaken, this statement was made in the context that LN is still on beta stage, so you shouldnt use it to transfer high volumes.

Briefly, LN is a way to do bitcoin transactions without putting a burden on the blockchain but still using it. The objective is to use LN like your hot wallet. You charge it with an amount you will be using for a month (using a transaction from your cold wallet/exchange) then expending it during this period.

The charging amount for example could be $1000, so, it would be totally secure to transact more than $20 for sure.",1525145700

I know this is a problem for those just looking for a ""get rich scheme"", but those of us who really want to disrupt the banking world it's fine that it takes time.

BCH can't be the one that distrupts the bangking world becase it's centralized and easily governed by the world elite. It has both, centralized mining and centralized nodes. Those are what matters. If Jihan and Roger decide to ""update"" the network, it will happen because they controll the nodes and the mining.

Goverments are not stupid, Bitcoin becoming a succesfull well used online payment system is a thread to their power.

" None.  Not even bitcoin.  If you really follow the development of the Lightning Network from the white paper to today, you will know that it has big technical hurdles that have yet to be overcome.   

It was first introduced in 2015.  The first announced “go live” date for lightning network was summer of 2016.  Yep, everyone was so excited that Lightning Network was arriving in the summer of 2016.  Didn’t happen of course, but why?  

Well there are many issues, like payment path finding (routing).  This was identified early on as a big issue.  Bitfury produced a highly technical paper with a routing solution.  But then Rusty Russel of Blockstream revealed the results of his testing showed it would not scale.  Yep, Lightning Network has a scaling problem.  The problem it is supposed to solve.  Fat forward to January 2018, Lightning Network is released on mainnet but what about the routing problem?  They just ignored that hoping to solve it later.  Today Lightning Network uses the gossip protocol which broadcasts payment channel states to every single node as every single channel is used.  This can’t work on a large scale and is why many Lightning Network transactions fail today.  

Earlier today Blockstream released a paper acknowledging some of these failings and an attempt to fix some.  You can read this for yourself.  As you read through this, realize that all of these issues where known since 2015.  Lightning Network was released anyways and this does not solve the biggest known issue identified by a rusty russel regarding payment routes.

1. The authority in this case, are the people that are working on this project day in and day out. Development is open to anyone who has the skills. And given time and effort, anyone could develop those skills and start to contribute. This is the ""authority"" we are ""appealing"" to in this case.

3. What? Just, what? Do you have trouble reading? What makes you think I am some kind of authority lover? Nothing in that statement implies the response you gave. LN is literally something that has never been implemented before, and the network secures a lot of capital. they are working daily on building it, and like i said before, anyone with the skills is able to contribute to building it. i really don't see how it warrants the response you gave. 

4. More propaganda. Say I am a wholesaler, you are a dropshipper. We setup LN channel to send transactions daily where you pay me to ship out your products. Where does blockstream profit in that scenario? 

5. You are blind if you haven't been able to see how an unknown adversary exploited existing disagreements to fracture a community, and to continue doing as much damage as possible to crypto as a whole. If your response to that is ""lol"", then, I don't know what to tell you

I only see value in the fact that the coin is default-privacy. It just comes down to whether or not that’s what the people want because isn’t the goal of cryptocurrency to be more open with each other and financially become one rather than hindering ourselves into our own private currencies, essentially what we do now considering the USD is not usable or seen on bank accounts in Europe and elsewhere, visa-versa, etc...

There are a few cryptos that have had single papers on single subjects peer reviewed, Charles the CEO has pointed this out himself, I’ll say thats peanuts to what Cardano is doing though.

Lastly, again things were scrutinized before peer review existed, that doesn’t mean peer review isn’t the absolute best thing we have, Cardano has set the bar in this regard, other cryptos need to elevate they’re game if they wanna play with the big boys now.",1525142592

"I’ll give you some examples of competing platforms and why they might be better for some applications:

Stellar: far simpler, much harder for buggy code to cause issues like ETH, and so much cheaper and faster

ARK: also faster, and tokens use a separate chain so you don’t have the main Blockchain bogged down with things like crypto kitties 

Also, it’s *super* easy to switch from one platform to another for most of these tokens. So deciding you want to use, say, ARK instead of ETH is pretty trivial. Especially since ARK is cross-compatible with other Blockchains, but even without that, it’s pretty simple to airdrop them. ",1525141937

"&gt;Most researchers, computer scientists, and cryptographers agree that a second layer is needed to achieve visa like scaling with a blockchain - and still retain decentralization. All the lightning network is is a second layer routing system. Over time it will continue to develop and get better. The vision for bitcoin is to not just be able to scale and handle large amounts of transactions, but to also be decentralized and permission-less. One has to wonder what the motives are of a group that is trying to de-legitimize a second layer scaling solution, very early in development, in favor of extremely large blocks.

This entire paragraph is an appeal to authority.

&gt;At the point when the debate was real heated, mining was (and arguably still is) way more centralized than it ideally should be. A valid concern was raised with simply just increasing the blocksize; it would further centralize mining. If we raised the block size first, mining becomes more centralized, which is a legitimate concern that shouldn't be downlplayed.

Sure, a larger blocksize theoretically increases ""centralization"". But the blocksize is not the reason why mining is centralized today. Mining is relatively centralized today, partially because of sha256 ASICS, but mostly due to the fact that economies of scale will always exist. All the challenge in mining is related to hashing, not related to downloading/uploading block data. So increasing the block size would not greatly modify the existing factors that pressure mining towards centralization today - sure block size impacts centralization, but it's effect is absolutely DWARFED by the effect that economies of scale &amp; ASICS have.

&gt;LN is something that hasn't been created before. It is something that is going to take a lot of time to do correctly and efficiently - and they are working on it daily. You can see this by following the various repos on github.

""Don't you dare develop anything yourselves, just wait for the authority to produce their perfect solution"".

Complex problems that if their technology becomes adopted would lead to significant personal gain for the individuals involved.

"Lmao, no it isn’t. That’s an absolutely stupid thing to say. Everything is already scrutinized, that has 0 effect on why peer review exists, and that goes for outside of the crypto realm as well.

If you think cardanos tech isn’t what they say it is you have an official platform to make it heard and official, post your own peer review paper and challenge or discredit them.peer review is the equivalent of stabbing the sword in the ground and calling all challengers. It’s the professional way to do things and every crypto should be doing it. Not to mention Cardano is creating new tech that even ethereum hasn’t gotten into yet, but cardano is already publishing peer review for it. How any single person could argue that going peer review is not the superior route is baffling to me.

On top of that, yes it’s good for cardano for people to know their company is so confident they are throwing everything out to be scrutinized in a professional manner. I don’t see any reality where crypto is mass adopted without the professional setting that every other technology uses. Peer review.

"Why hasn't anybody mentioned how blatantly misleading this chart is? Through most of him talking the chart biased to show the peak at $20k as being lower than it actually was. 80% of the chart is $0-$6000 and only the top 20% is $6001-$20,000. Even when he zooms in between August 2017 and April 2018, half the graph is $0-$7000 and the top half is $7001-$20,000. Bottom 50% is $6000, and the top 50% is $13999.

So ""they"" would need to go after hurting the value of bitcoin.  Since the hashrate pretty much corresponds directly with the price, halving the exchange rate might reduce the amount of mining by half or more as well.

Might be easier to simply encourage mining to occur using renewable sources, resulting in not only no increase in the carbon footprint, but causing a large amount of new investment (including increased R&amp;D) into renewables, which historically, has resulted in even lower production costs for renewable.  e.g., solar, and onshore wind now down to $0.05 per kWh or less .... which is a fraction of what it was a decade ago, thanks to the significant nvestments over that time.",1525140389

My conspiracy theory is someone with the wallet access is making a shitton off of shorting bitcoin and being able to control the market just by moving the coins. The trustees dont get mad because there agreement isn't violated, and someone at mt gox is still happy because they can make bank. Just my 2 cents",1525139794

Lightning may never take off like you guys hope, it's quite convoluted to use and may face scaling issues as well.

"The last bull run that happened was unnatural, as evident by the correction seen afterward. I anticipate that we may see a bull run like it again, followed by a correction, but I think we are more likely to see a slower steadier upswing, especially because we have futures market for bitcoin. 

Now considering that, we have people much more aware of the problem that high fees caused. So we now have transaction batching. If there is a large influx of new users, they will most likely purchase from institutions that batch transactions, so it should alleviate congestion it would otherwise have caused to a degree.

"At the risk of invoking the disaster that was the Bitcoin Foundation, I would like to refer to the Linux Foundation: https://www.linuxfoundation.org/

When you have a foundation businesses can work with, the more the ecosystem grows the more of them can be expected to contribute - out of their own interest. And as long as the players are diverse, they can be expected to want to fund to stay neutral.

Problem with this, of course, is that it's only been shown to work with a reasonably levelheaded benevolent dictator - Linus Torvalds turned out to be one, Vitalik _might_ become one in time, but Bitcoin is expressedly _not_ gonna have a benevolent dictator. Linux used this model, ETH used this model, Zcash used this model (they have a fund too), but Bitcoin (Cash) will never adopt this. 

I'm not convinced the treasury system in DASH is a good one either - holders of coins or even holders of masternodes, both liquid assets, usually prove to be very poor decisionmakers in the long term. They have _less_ skin in the game than ASIC miners, who at least have these boxes who are difficult to get rid of and only ROIs in a few months to a year. 

I have no ready answers, but for starters I just want people to know  that https://donator.cash exists and maintained by /u/nxtchg.

"First good point I have seen. 

However, by the same logic, 1mb could be too big, and the magic number is smaller.

I am glad that we didn't jack the blocksize up in response to the high fees. It spurred innovation, encouraged good stewardship of space on the blockchain, and ensured savings down the road. You may be using LN or a custodial account, or something, but if it stops the fiat currencies, then it's a success. Many bitcoin folks are willing to be very patient to ensure that bitcoin will end the fiat and central banking system. Low time preference types.... This is why some people's actions may be inexplicable to some in this sub.
.

The smaller the blockchain in size, the more copies can be out there run by different people and machines. Some people don't care about how big it could get. We don't have the luxury of doing that because it can't be undone. It's irresponsible.

"Reply by Warren Buffett's fan, CFA, MBA and an investor..

Warren Buffett is right that Bitcoin does not fulfill his investment philosophy but it does not mean that it is a bad investment.

15 years back even Amazon would not have fulfilled his investment philosophy and would be a 'gamble' as per his philosophy but that does not make Amazon a bad investment.

The way I and most other people view Bitcoin is that it is not a 100% guaranteed return opportunity but an investment where risk-adjusted return is very high. There is more than 10% chance bitcoin's value going up by more than 10 folds, 1% chance bitcoin's value going up 100 folds. Even if there is 80-90% chance bitcoin value going to near zero, Bitcoin value is significantly less than it's expected value in future.

EV = Sum of (ProbabilityXFuture Values) = 1%X1,000,000 +10%X100,000+89%X0 = $20,000

Given the risk-return odds in bitcoin it is advisable to invest an amount one is comfortable losing.

Also, Buffet's argument of how farms have value even if they are not traded and comparison with Bitcoin is flawed. Bitcoin has characteristics of commodity (gold) and currency which by it's inherent nature requires exchanging hands. If currency is not allowed to be exchanged, it is nothing more than a piece of paper.

If I had Billion dollars or even few millions to invest, I would completely follow Warren Buffett's risk-averse investment philosophy but unfortunately I do not have the millions to invest so a 10% annualized returns would make me rich in 10-20 years. But Bitcoin offers me a 10% chance to be rich or lose it all. I like the odds and want to take that 'gamble'!",1525138519

"I'm saying that the current value of bitcoin is, just to make it simple, is $10,000 a piece. The current market cap of bitcoin is around 170 billion. Ten thousand twenty million times is about 200 billion, so we're pretty close. Now to way oversimplify things, multiply these numbers. 10,000 x 100 = 1,000,000 (the ""projected"" price of bitcoin), likewise, the market cap of the coins at 10,000 a piece (say 200,000,000,000 or 200bn) times 100, equals 1.6e+13, or 20 trillion dollars. So yes, 20tn is correct.

You're right, that's not more valuable that earth, but it's misleading to compare it to real estate value. If I'm not mistaken, the combined GDP of every nation on earth is 80 Trillion, so for bitcoin to be worth 1,000,000 a piece, it would need to be worth as much as 1/4 of every country on earth is today, or over a trillion dollars more valuable than the entire modern united states is...

This is actually proving my point, we're arguing over weather it's ""only"" worth the equivalent of the entire USA, or if it's worth part of all real estate on earth combined. I have a strong feeling the answer is neither, and will probably never be. I see the crypto market as a whole topping out between 7-10 tn in today's economic terms, and that's spread across all of them many years from now. I mean, who the fuck am I to make predictions, but I don't think it takes a genius to say ""bitcoin will probably not be worth the equivalent of the modern day united states""...",1525138078

"RBF actually enables a way to discourage double spending called scorched earth.

What this allows is for the merchant software to, upon detecting an RBF double spend, create a new dependent transaction sending the entire value to miners. This new pair of transactions will replace the double spend as it has higher total fees. The attacker cannot replace this transaction as there is no way through RBF to increase the fee further.

The *only* way the attacker can defend against this is for the replacement transaction to be included in the blockchain before the scorched earth transaction. This type of attack would *not need RBF* to be successful, it could be equally applied to any non-RBF BTC or BCH transaction.",1525137798

High fees force you to use lightning for anything that isn't a large-dollar value transaction such that large fees aren't that big a deal. If you want to do any kind of microtransaction system, yeah you're forced to use Lightning today. Instead, many of those projects have moved to BCH today.

"&gt;**Abstract**

&gt;Bitcoin, and other blockchain based systems, are inherently limited
in their scalability. On-chain payments must be verified and stored by
every node in the network, meaning that the node with the least resources limits the overall throughput of the system as a whole. Layer
2, also called off-chain protocols, are often seen as the solution to these
scalability issues: by renegotiating a shared state among a limited set
of participants, and not broadcasting the vast majority of state updates to the blockchain, the load on the network is reduced. Central
to all Layer 2 protocols is the issue of guaranteeing that an old state
may not be committed once it has been replaced. In this work we
present eltoo, a simple, yet powerful replacement mechanims for Layer
2 protocols. It introduces the idea of state numbers, an on-chain enforceable variant of sequence numbers that were already present in the
original implementation, but that were not enforceable.",1525137456
"No, lightning network itself works off chain.  

However to get on the lightning network you first have to open a lightning channel which is done on chain.  
Your lightning network channel will have a certain amount of bitcoin (the amount you put on there) on it and you can keep trading back and forth with other linked channels, including the ones the people you'r connected to are connected to and even the ones those people are connected to, etc.  
(So if you are connected to a well connected node you don't have to open other channels).  

The other time that lightning network comes back to being on-chain again is when you or the person/entity you'r connected to close the channel, this is when all the bitcoin in those channels goes to their respective owners on chain instead of off chain.",1525137412

"Some hate it.  Most of us just see it as something that, as you say, will take a long time to evolve.

The LN whitepaper proposed it as a way to make microtransactions: those that even a 1-cent fee is too expensive.  That is far from being advertised as 'the way everyone will make payments'.

BTC developers sold it as the be-all-end-all way to scale Bitcoin.  They are the ones who are putting LN in the hot seat to solve **their scaling issue**.  The BTC developers pushed the blame onto LN.  If they are eventually going to scale on-chain, then just do it and relieve the pressure for LN to succeed quickly.  Do it to relieve the fees and terrible user and merchant experience.

We had merchant adoption and recognition moving towards Bitcoin.  Just as it looked like it was going great, the 'fee market' was introduced.  We were told that LN will fix it all.

BTC adoption has stalled out.  It is all depending on LN for its future.  And that future is still a long way out.  Implementing routing on top of a rolled-out LN network is going to be tricky.  People are going to lose coins.

I'd rather side with something that is able to grow and expand.  Today.

If LN works, BCH will adopt it, too.  It will be even better with 0-conf and cheap fees to open/close a channel.  It can be used for microtransactions, and there is no need for it to try to handle every payment.

2) Any privacy-oriented individual is already swinging towards Monero and in some cases (Snowden) Zcash. So now it's just a debate between those two.

3) Private by default is what saves you when shit hits the fan. In the event of mainstream adoption, if you just use a single XMR transaction then switch back to BTC and an insurance company figures out your new BTC address you're still fucked by mass surveillance. Monero covers your tracks.

True, but bitcoin dominance is [on a clear downtrend](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage).

&gt;least volatile crypto asset

There are a number of ""stable"" coins out there, which of course are less volatile. I don't really understand how low volatility is important for bitcoin when it's basically unusable as a currency to begin with due to slow transactions and high fees. It's not even aiming to be a currency anymore, just a ""store of value/investment"" Check out how much miner fees vary month by month, they're like $2 right now and were like $30 in December... During December, there were loads of wallets with balances below the minimum fee so these wallets had their balances basically trapped for a few weeks, but it is clear this is a non-issue to the core devs since they refuse to do anything to fix it. Even mentioning this can get you banned from /r/bitcoin or bitcoin talk.

Hashing power doesn't mean much in a world of ASICs, a lot of people claim a Sybil attack is feasible right now with Bitcoin. If just 3 Chinese ASICs pools colluded, they could do a 51% attack today. Also, nearly all ASICs for Bitcoin are produced by Bitmain so they become the gatekeepers of Bitcoin mining, you need their permission to mine Bitcoin.

True, no question. 

&gt;good developers 

Oh God no, how can you believe this? They have never gone by community consensus or even taken the community's opinion on anything... An overwhelming amount of the core developers are employees for a for-profit company called ""Blockstream"", whose business model is to create side-chains, thus incentivizing them to make the main chain slow and unusable. The largest hubs of discussion (/r/bitcoin, bitcointalk) are very censored and will ban anyone who advocates for a larger block size.

&gt;reigning market cap champ since the beginning of crypto

True, but bitcoin dominance is [on a clear downtrend](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage). There also seems to be a [correlation between mempool size (number of transactions not added to the next block) and it's decrease in market dominance, that is, altcoins rise as bitcoin transaction speed decreases](https://i.imgur.com/zR1gtLI.png)

&gt;least volatile crypto asset

There are a number of ""stable"" coins out there, which of course are less volatile. I don't really understand how low volatility is important for bitcoin when it's basically unusable as a currency to begin with due to slow transactions and high fees. It's not even aiming to be a currency anymore, just a ""store of value/investment"" Check out how much miner fees vary month by month, they're like $2 right now and were like $30 in December... During December, there were loads of wallets with balances below the minimum fee so these wallets had their balances basically trapped for a few weeks, but it is clear this is a non-issue to the core devs since they refuse to do anything to fix it. Even mentioning this can get you banned from /r/bitcoin or bitcoin talk.

&gt;most widely accepted crypto

True as well, but a metric you're forgetting is the rate of adoption. Bitcoin is being dropped by a lot of merchants (Steam, Reddit, Stripe), while other coins are seeing adoption at a much higher rate now.",1525135977
"&gt; Do you realize that if bitcoin hit the ""One million dollars a piece"" people keep claiming it ""might"" hit, that bitcoins market cap would surpass the value of planet earth?

I'd recommend checking a calculator.  Let's say 20 million bitcoins circulating.  That's a gross over-simplification, ie. 21m potential someday vs 17mth just mined vs current float less dead coins, etc.), but let's just for the sake of argument settle on 20 million bitcoins.  At a dollar per coin, that's $20m.  At a thousand, that's $20b.  At a million dollars per coin, that's $20t.

If you're suggesting that the ""value of the planet earth"" is less than $20 trillion, you should reassess.  The total listed value of all global real estate in 2015 was listed at $217 trillion.  That doesn't include the value of people, equipment, commodities, money, financial instruments, intellectual property, and all the thousands of other things that would combine to equate to the ""value of planet earth.""

They will shit on the team for some shit about IOTA. Basically, ENG found problems with the security aspect of the code in IOTA. Went to IOTA and told them. IOTA acted extremely unprofessional about the whole thing, calling out the ENG team and saying there was nothing wrong with their code. Then, emails leaked from IOTA that showed ENG was extremely professional and that IOTA were more or less dicks to them, and that there actually were security problems with their code that they discussed internally, but never to the public.

it's all an illusion...

as soon as people decide a twenty dollar bill isn't worth twenty bucks anymore( which it isn't).... the dollar is dead.

all it will take is a waking up of the masses, and the countries that buy Us debt( which is already happening)....to revolt.

look up Germany's hyperinflation, Zimbabwe's hyperinflation, and Venezuela's current hyperinflation...

the US is heading that direction, where it takes a wheel barrel of valueless fiat to get a loaf of bread... or a just few grains of gold for the same loaf.

if the US goes hyperinflation, and let's assume bitcoin goes to the moon..... what are you going to trade your bitcoin for????

 you won't take the worthless fiat, and you better hope other people value bitcoin more than gold or silver.

In venuzela they are adding bitcoin atms, but what are you going to buy BTC with....if it takes a table full of paper currency to buy a sandwhich, how are you going to fit a house full of paper currency in a atm to buy a $9,000.00 bit coin..

until bitcoin is not valued in fiat, it will always be bound to the manipulation, middlemen, and inflation.

I don't think bitcoin is the savior that most people hope it will be...

I currently believe it is a pump and dump, a bubble that will eventually burst.... but at what price will it be at when it does???

I think the upside of its ""value"" in USD is many times it's current price...and this is why I'm currently involved.

Bitcoin has not reached its ceiling yet...
let's hope it does before hyperinflation hits the US..... that way we can still exchange BTC for fiat... and live like kings for a little bit.

if BTC price rises because of hyperinflation, we are f@cked!!!! .... unless everyone values  BTC more than precious metals.

"&gt;""Paralyzed"" is a pretty good description.

The Bitcoin network was at full capacity and processing transactions at maximum speed. I wouldn’t call that paralyzed.

These episodes never lasted long and transacting was still possible by using sufficient fee. Stuck transactions can always be unstuck by replacing them with the same transaction but having a higher fee.

On-chain transacting inevitably runs into capacity limits. VISA-level transaction processing capacity requires sustaining at least 10,000 transactions per second, resulting in 2 GB blocks. That amounts to 300 GB per day and 1.1 TB of blockchain growth per year. Worse, it would require nodes to have terabit connection speeds to be able to serve the network plus a datacenter to sync the blockchain because of the significant CPU power that is required to validate a transaction.

On-chain transacting is a dead end and also not required for mass adoption. This can be achieved with second-layer, off-chain transacting solutions such as the Lightning Network, which also enables instant transfers.",1525134875

&gt; Inflation is actually pretty high, though hidden.

Lmao you don't understand what ""stable currency"" means. A ""stable currency"" is one that changes in value very slowly. The rate of inflation is approximately 3% a year. That's very stable. Bitcoin changes price 1000% in a single year, that is *not* stable, just FYI. USD goes down 3% due to inflation, bitcoin climbs and falls 50% in a single month. Rapid inflation and deflation of 1000% in 1 year is very bad.

&gt; Steam took bitcoin

And then they stopped for lack of interest. Walmart doesn't accept it, nor do 99% of all brick and mortar store merchants. So you proudly declare that 3 merchants accept bitcoin and 20,000 do not. 

&gt; They only walked back on that when transaction fees became stupid, which was 100% avoidable

Except this [wasn't the only reason](https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/1464096684955433613) why Steam stopped supporting bitcoin:

&gt; As of today, Steam will no longer support Bitcoin as a payment method on our platform due to high fees *and volatility in the value of Bitcoin.*

Let me explain: if you are Steam and someone buys a game on it for $20 in bitcoin, then bitcoin falls in value by 50% (as an example), then you just made $10 instead of $20. If someone buys a game on it for $20 and then bitcoin rises in value by 50%, then you just made $30 instead of $20. ""Oh that second one sounds amazing though, you can make free money!"" you are saying to yourself right now, but when bitcoin rises in value, what do you think that does to usage of bitcoin? Why would you use a currency that is currently rising in value when you could just use the USD in your bank account instead to make the same purchase? When bitcoin price rises, transactions fall because people make more money by not selling.

&gt; If you create a word whose meaning is obvious, then it has done the job of a word, to communicate a concept. 

Ok, so what is a bitcoinization (another made up word)? By it's base roots, it comes up to ""bitcoin"" and ""-ization"". The ""-ization"" part means ""Action, process, or result of doing or making"". So, bitcoinization is not ""the replacement of USD with bitcoin"", it is ""the action of bitcoin"", ""the process of bitcoin"" or ""the result of making bitcoin"". Which one is it? It could also be interpreted to mean that there is a ""hyper bitcoin"" and the ""-ization"" part could mean ""replacing regular bitcoin with hyper bitcoin"". The idea of words is to communicate the meaning of a sentence in as few words as possible. Someone who doesn't know anything about bitcoin is not going to understand what ""hyperbitcoinization"" means. You could cut down on confusion and simply say ""rapid adoption of bitcoin"", which communicates the same phrase without any chance of confusion by using two made up words in a seven-syllable word.",1525134662

Anyone can take the term bitcoin and add a modifier to create a trademark, but no one could get away with trademarking the generic term now that so many people are using it as a generic term.

Again, bitcoin core fucked up by not creating a foundation that could hold the trademark and defend it. Now its generic and anyone can use it.

"If you're paying for goods from an account owned by the same entity as the payment processor, you're still paying with Bitcoin. It's just that the transaction doesn't have to be made on chain, because the trustlessness of the blockchain is not required because there is no second entity to trust.

It's like if you go into the shop owned by your parents on pocket money day. They have custody of ""your"" pocket money (let's say $5). It is by all accounts your money, it's just that they have possession of it. You want a $1 chocolate bar. What happens here? Well there's no point in them giving you $5 only for you to return $1. So you take the chocolate bar, and they now hold $4 of your pocket money. The fact that no money changes hands is analogous to the fact that no on chain transaction is necessary.

This analogy is accurate because technically if you're money is in a hot wallet, you don't own it. So money can be rerouted without fees by the wallet and payment processor (if they are the same entity, as in this case).

The idea is to just replace what you spent in btc. That way more btc transactions for everyone,1525132645
"&gt; Correction: how do you suggest Bitcoin will replace USD? 

Historically, all fiat eventually hyperinflates or goes badly in some way, because humans are in control of them and humans are fallible.

So really, all crypto has to do is wait for the USD to screw up in one way or another, and people will switch of their own accord. Even if that takes 100 years. Historically-speaking, the US as a world reserve currency is about at the age where most of the others were dethroned from that position. China is angling to make the yuan the next world reserve currency, but it's likely they'd be happy simply to dethrone the dollar even if the yuan doesn't become it.

At one point it was the British pound, how did they lose it? Well, there as social upheaval via war and the US came out of top. Similar things could happen to the US one day, who knows.

&gt; I don't care what Venezuela is doing because the corruption of their government is driving the people there to every alternate currency, even USD. 

You have to recognize though that what is driving people away from the Bolivar is the exact same thing that is happening to the US dollar, the difference is only one of degree.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In a first world country however, there is zero threat to fiat. 

Not necessarily. The US dollar actually has a unique weakness, the fact that it's a reserve currency means central banks all over the world must hold lots of dollars to defend their own currencies from speculative attacks.

If they all decide to dump the dollar, the dollar would die overnight. This isn't very likely because they'd all lose a lot of money doing that, but cascades of this sort can happen. 

There was a bank report awhile back with a central banker saying they might have to start holding reserves of bitcoin to defend against speculative attacks using cryptocurrencies. That could, long term, result in interesting problems.

If everyone tries to sell the dollar and buy crypto, that creates a similar situation to a run on the bank.

&gt; USD is very stable 

Inflation is actually pretty high, though hidden. It's not so bad that people won't hold dollars, but people will not save in dollars.

&gt; and Bitcoin poses no threat to it and very few people want to use Bitcoin because it's harder to use and the value fluctuates so badly it's utterly stupid to pay in bitcoin rather than HODL and make more. This is why no major companies (WalMart, Amazon, 99% of all brick and mortar stores, etc) accept Bitcoin.

Okay, keep thinking that way, but these things can change very quickly. Overstock.com took bitcoin for a time, Microsoft took bitcoin, Steam took bitcoin. They only walked back on that when transaction fees became stupid, which was 100% avoidable, but the Core devs foolishly didn't avoid it causing the community to fork and create BCH where that can't happen ever again, or at least that is the intent and expectation.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Words have to have meaning outside of the person using it. 

If you create a word whose meaning is obvious, then it has done the job of a word, to communicate a concept. Conflations like ""Hyperbitcoinization"" do that successfully in a way that a word like ""mixeplaz"" does not. You know what hyperbitcoinization means just by seeing it, so it's a word, because it successfully communicates the concept.

"&gt; If both solutions [segwit] are essentially equivalent, then why do I see posts smearing segwit almost every day in this sub?

Equal in terms of malleability is not equal in terms of other factors. There are valid arguments against the segwit approach rather than the hard-fork approach to fixing malleability.

One of the major ones spoken early on before segwit was adopted was the splitting of the user-base and the technical debt. 

Segwit is a malleability fix at the expense of greatly complicating the codebase in a way that a hard-fork fix would not have done.

Further, segwit put a burden on every bitcoin service and app to support segwit, which is why it took so long for even the Core-devs to produce a wallet with segwit compatibility, and why segwit use is still quite low.

The hate for segwit more likely stems from the argument that we needed larger blocks to stop transactions filling the block, and the counter that segwit was effectively a block-size increase so we don't need to hardfork.

The truth was that Core did not want to hardfork because, as they admitted, this would prevent the blocks from filling up and thus forestall the need for 2nd layer solutions. This is not conspiracy, this is what they actually said.

Core devs went so far as to celebrate full blocks and create excuses for high transaction fees caused as a result.

The BTC propaganda has gone so far as to suggest that segwit is the only way to fix malleability. Many on the other sub don't seem to realize there are other ways to fix it, and the BCH is planning a fix for it too.

And if malleabilty is fully fixed on BCH, and Lightning works, then there's no reason to use BTC with Lightning anymore, everyone will begin using it with BCH since it has far lower fees and far more capacity. Most people won't care about BTC vs BCH if both can get the job done the same way except that one is significantly cheaper.

Notice that I stated that most researchers and cryptographers agreed a second layer is necessary.

To rebuke this claim, he steers the conversation to a slightly different, but similar topic. 

What do you define as actual research? As we know from lets say, medical literature - institutions with deep pockets will often publish papers that are favorable to their companys ambition. 

However, I would wager that there are indeed papers out there published about second layer networks. It is notable that there is the lightning network, and also the raiden network. 

According to mr jonald_fyookball, the folks of bitcoin and ethereum have it all wrong. there is no need for a second layer solution. i guess they must be wasting their time? are they not researchers, computer scientists, and cryptographers that worked together and came to the conclusion that these technologies were necessary?",1525131692

I appreciate Roger's enthusiasm in fighting Blockstream's takeover, but I feel like what is done is done, if the BTC we invested in was forced to change its name so be it, we should just accept that and move on now. Throwing more gas on that fire does us no good at this point. ",1525131685

"I think the developers have set themselves some pretty heavy demands with two hard forks per year. I think one hard fork per year is much less demanding on the developers' time and gives them a decent lead time to get the software released a few months in advance and the ecosystem updating their nodes in time for a hard fork. This recent one was a bit of a shambles. People releasing their updated node software only a few weeks before the hard fork.

Then you have the problem of multiple teams working on Bitcoin Cash. So you have to pay the developers 3? times to get the same work done in all the clients.

To be honest I liked people working on it on a volunteer basis rather than getting money involved. Money can skew and distort things.

That's just like, your opinion, man. And it's the common misconception. That's not how it's described in the whitepaper. The proof of work is only described with relation to ""the system"", ""the network"" and possible attacks on the network. More specifically:

&gt; Bitcoin Whitepaper: If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any **competing chains**.

BTC and BCH are not in competition with each other. They are also not attacking each other. The networks aren't trying to attack/rewrite each other. So the ""nakamoto consensus"" does not apply here. 

You are redefining the ""nakamoto consensus"" in an attempt to invalidate BCH. The only rational here is your personal desire.

You see Bitcoin as some almighty all-compassing empirical truth. The reality is that Satoshi was just a software developer who described and created a peer-to-peer software system. He called that system Bitcoin. 

Your truth is a paradox. How could it be that BCH exists? Fact: Multiple Bitcoin networks are applying Satoshi's consensus rules. Fact: Multiple Bitcoin networks are co-existing.",1525131501

If people want to do a private deal with dollars, BTC, or w/e, that's fine too, of course. But I want to deal in BCH, and I expect most people will as well due to the advantages of doing so, and the disadvantages of trying to do so with BTC.

"Hello SHOOSE_CERNAME. It is possible that nefarious interests running a propaganda campaign have altered your viewpoint on a very technical subject. I am not saying that it did happen, only that it is possible that it could have happened - just like it could have happened to me. 

Most researchers, computer scientists, and cryptographers agree that a second layer is needed to achieve visa like scaling with a blockchain - and still retain decentralization. All the lightning network is is a second layer routing system. Over time it will continue to develop and get better. The vision for bitcoin is to not just be able to scale and handle large amounts of transactions, but to also be decentralized and permission-less. One has to wonder what the motives are of a group that is trying to de-legitimize a second layer scaling solution, very early in development, in favor of extremely large blocks. 

At the point when the debate was real heated, mining was (and arguably still is) way more centralized than it ideally should be. A valid concern was raised with simply just increasing the blocksize; it would further centralize mining. If we raised the block size first, mining becomes more centralized, which is a legitimate concern that shouldn't be downlplayed. 

LN is something that hasn't been created before. It is something that is going to take a lot of time to do correctly and efficiently - and they are working on it daily. You can see this by following the various repos on github.

"&gt; The only real downside I can see is that I found no mention of plans to upgrade to a quantum-resistant signature scheme. IMO, any coin that has the goal to become the currency of the future should be proactive enough to resist the types of attacks that will likely be possible 8-20 years from now. Hopefully the devs (or the community) will step up in this regard within the next few years.

The devs will step up if and when it is an appropriate time to do so.  However in my opinion these attacks are way overblown right now by ""sky is falling"" journalism and coins who implement it as a novelty.  Also the remediation at this point is just as theoretical as the attacks.

We don't see much movement around crypto and the general security world right now on this topic because it's no Y2K.

&gt;Does this mean has PIVX does not have a max supply?

Yes, it has one of the lowest inflation rates in crypto because it's streamlined to support stakers, MNs, and the development.  No miners to pay is a great cost savings.  Those rewards do not cut off at an arbitrary date like other coins who just want to say they'll be deflationary in 120 years.  We'll be deflationary when our burnt fees outnumber the coin emission per block, but until then it's just ultra low inflation.

It's not the banks themselves, it's their customers that will soon be given the option by investment brokers keen to get a big commission for themselves.

Look at it in totality. One more time, because no one seems to listen to this part, **the banks themselves have already bought in**. Bank customers will soon be given the option to diversify their investment portfolios into crypto.

"&gt;Is that meant as a 'safeguard' in case USDT fails?

Essentially, yes. As I remember it, the CDS was user-created for a fee. The user supplied 1+ BTC which was split into an A-block and a B-block. The A-block got 100% of the BTC if the value of Tether was $1 or more at the time of maturation. The B-block got a percentage of the BTC equal to the difference in cents between 1 USD and 1 USDT--for example 5% of the BTC if the value of USDT was $0.95. The user could then sell whichever block they wanted to using the exchange. It honestly sounded too clever by half to me--that is, more of a way to generate exchange fees than to provide a useful hedge.

Me and my business partner's credit cards stopped working on certain purchases, and we were confused. So, we called for some clarification. After being hung up on 5 times (their systems are being updated so that's understandable - kind of), I finally talked with someone.

Both me and my partner have paid off our credit cards right away after each purchase (we really only use them to gain rewards). As of now, I have an outstanding balance of $21, and she has an outstanding balance around $100. We make all of these payments and see all of these transactions through our BBVA.com portal.

After an hour of talking, they tell me about something called ""CentreSuite"" which businesses use to access their bank information. I've never heard of this in my life, and I actually still have the packet the BBVA account manager gave us a year ago when we opened our account, and there is absolutely no reference to CentreSuite anywhere.

They say our cards aren't working because we have an outstanding balance of nearly $5,000, and it's only accessible to view or pay from CentreSuite. Again, we have always paid off our credit cards and have never had a problem. They keep saying, ""yes, you've paid your main accounts, but you have an outstanding balance in your 'main' account"". I still don't know what this means.

We ask how we can access our CentreSuite accounts, and they said that we have to write a handwritten letter and send it to BBVA Corporate office. We ask if we can see it at a local branch, and they told us ""yes, they can help you write the letter at a local branch"". There's not even a form online to fill out. We literally just have to write a letter from scratch. I don't even know what to ask for?

A supervisor is calling back to explain this. As a young startup that's honestly doing pretty well, this $5,000 will take out everything in our account"" and payroll will be interesting.

I also disagree that increasing the blocksize will lead to reduction in the number of full nodes. This is only true if the blockchain growth outpaces the price of hard drive space.

"&gt; A fiat currency is one that has no intrinsic value 

There is no such thing as intrinsic value, value is in the mind of the valuer. So that is your first basic economic mistake in reasoning about this. Dispense with thinking in terms of intrinsic value.

The only thing that is intrinsic to a thing is the quality of that thing, and human beings then place value on those qualities. But this placing of value is extrinsic, it must be placed in a social context. 

E.g.: oil has all the same qualities that it's always had since time immemorial. But it used to be considered just a nuisance back in the pre-modern times. It was sticky and black and sometimes caught fire, and was generally useless and the Arabs didn't know what to do with it.

Then one day someone invents the internal combustion engine which requires refining large amounts of oil into gasoline. The qualities of that oil did not change, but the value we place on its qualities did. Value was not intrinsic to oil, value can fluctuate wildly. Oil value is currently dropping as solar and wind gain momentum.

&gt; A fiat currency is one that has no intrinsic value and is agreed upon to represent value.

The thing about fiat is that it does not, in itself, have the qualities of a good money. A strip of paper is not a great money. It's not better than gold and silver, necessarily. That is, many people would go back to using gold and silver if not for legal tender laws. Fiat then is inherently a function of state power. Fiat cannot exist unless there is a political power forcing it on the people. That aspect is missing from your definition.

Fiat is that which can only exist in association with a political power and its exercising of force, whereas other forms of free-market money do not require the use of force for them to be used as money.

The reason fiat requires force is because there is an issuing entity for fiat. Whereas, there is no issuing entity for gold, silver, or crypto, no one controls these.

Fiat requires an issuing entity because it's much cheaper to create dollar bills than the face value they are meant to represent. So without force, there would be widespread counterfeiting.

By contrast, you cannot counterfiet gold, silver, or crypto. Thus no such force is required.

I could go on.

&gt; There is no requirement to be issued by a controlling entity or requirement to have no limit on issuance.

There is such a requirement, because of the factors I just mentioned. The controlling and issuing entities are able to print more money to enrich themselves without doing any work. If everyone were allowed to do the same the fiat currency would quickly hyperinflate and be worthless. Fiat without political force cannot survive.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; BTW, no limit on issuance is a good thing.

This is completely false and you need to read up on your Austrian economics. A deflationary currency with a limit on issuance is strongly desirable.

"&gt; Inflation itself isn't a sign of a healthy economy.

It's not the only sign, but it's a fairly good indicator. It means people are spending their money instead of saving it all. 

&gt; It will happen regardless of the economy health because there is always more of the currency being produced.

That's not true, see above. If people saved all their money it would deflate faster than a balloon regardless of how much the fed printed. It will also depend on other circumstances whether you had price inflation or monetary deflation.  It's neither bad nor good in itself and depends on the entire economic situation as a whole. 

&gt;However inflation must be monitored and regulated, because if it's not it can get out of control and destroy an economy. 

This is true.

&gt;Which is why Bitcoin put a cap on their currency, to create a deflationary currency. Meaning overtime it should steadily increase in value. Though Satoshi didn't plan for increasing adoption and speculative investing.

Satoshi didn't build a currency, he built an open ledger protocol on top of a cryptographically secured linked-list. He didn't account for a ton of economic principles that easily make bitcoin a shitty currency because he wasn't trying to make a currency. This is why we see the Lightning Network and other 3rd party applications having to be built on top of the Bitcoin protocol to make it function anywhere near appropriately. 

&gt;Spending shouldn't decrease the value of a currency. 

Except it does since people/business always wants more than they get out. I pay $5 for something that cost $1 to make? I just added $4 to the economy out of thin air. Any time you buy something that makes a profit you add value to the economy and it decreases the value of the currency used to purchase it since you didn't magically make $4 in cash, but $4 in virtual currency. 

&gt;But if people are just buying groceries and going about their daily lives. Spending shouldn't have any impact on it's value because the people who received the currency are going to put the money right back into the economy.

Except they don't, not everyone lives paycheck to paycheck. (though a lot do)

Cryptocurrencies are just another store of value like gold, cash, commercial bank deposits. They just are not limited by one central actor (normally) acting as the ledger keeper and in Bitcoins case no one controls the total volume unless there is consensus. ",1525126465

They are comparing data from two points, mid november, and march 1st.

"&gt; Can you explain how Bitcoin is meant to destroy a currency that is backed by a government, complete with laws, mints, etc all working toward making more? 

Pretty easy, actually. It's already happened in many places that ditched one currency because the gov had completely mismanaged it, the people rejected that currency completely and began using other currencies.

A prime example is Honduras, where the government currency is still, to this day, completely rejected by the people. You seem to think governments are somehow all powerful, they aren't. People can ignore laws when they are untenable and the gov can't do anything, because they can't jail everyone. 

Honduras hyper-inflated their currency and abused the people with it so much that they just said fuck you guys and began using the US dollar, which was at that time a far safer and far more stable currency.

The gov did everything it could since then to get its own currency back in play, but hasn't been able to. For like over two decades now.

Honduras even created their own cryptocurrency to try to lure people back in, much as Venezuela has done, but that too has failed.

Speaking of Venezuela, the same has happened there, where dollars and crypto have taken over as the preferred currency, and no one wants Bolivars which lose value too fast.

Fiat in general loses value over time, and crypto tends to gain value over time. Long term, that implies complete replacement of fiat with crypto, just a matter of time. If you don't see that, too bad for you. Maybe your children will use crypto long after you've refused to do so, much as granny never used a computer.

&gt; We still make pennies and that costs us an absurd amount more than they're worth, but we still make them. But you say that everyone will just magically dump fiat one day. How?

You do realize that gold and silver was once that every-day currency, for a helluva lot longer than fiat has been around, yet fiat completely replaced gold and silver, right? You have a historical model of how something gets replaced over time sitting right in front of you yet you're sitting here pretending it's somehow impossible or unthinkable.

It's pretty simple, the competing currency gets used in more and more transactions because it has advantages compared to the other currency, and soon it's doing more transactions than the other, which quickly doesn't get used anymore. Done. This can be quick or fast, but it does and has happened historically.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Also, ""hyperbitcoinization"" is not a word. 

Words are communication devices and anyone can create any word they want, as long as it gets the point across, which that word clearly does. It is a word. This is a dumb critique.

Also in this specific case when accepted in its bitcoin form the sender does not need to convert their bitcoin to the local currency.  
Just like with any other kind of money you can spend bitcoin in more than one way so in this specific case off-chain, for something that doesn't require an on-chain transaction doesn't mean the blockchain securing the whole currency becomes useless and this specific payment itself does not need to be trustless (trusting Bitflyer in this case).  

So this doesn't diminish bitcoins use-case of being usable as trust-less on-chain payment options when it's needed directly from your own private wallet owned by you instead of an exchange if you need that layer of security for your transaction which would come at the cost of transaction/confirmation speed.",1525125768

Japanese companies in the 1930s were making cheap knock offs, but over time they improved and became companies such Canon and Nikon.   Both of which are major companies today. 

Montgomery Ward used to be one of the biggest retailers in the nation.  They are pretty much gone now.  Why?  Because the minute someone can do something better and you lose your market base your are worth nothing.

There's absolutely nothing that prevents that from happening with Bitcoin.  What are knock offs now could easily become dominant coins in the future and there's no telling what kind of new technology could come out in 5 years time that could replace Bitcoin.  

&gt;Cut along story short and tell me 4 things gold can do better or can do that bitcoin can’t, apart from jewellery and lab experiments?

Sure tell me 4 things bitcoin can do better than decentralization,  divisibility,  transferability, and limited Supply. 

Oh wait, turns out if you arbitrarily take away important factors you can make anything seem worthless. Try again. 

Sorry those lab experiments are valuable regardless of gold's status as money.  Bitcoin on the other hand is only valuable if it is used as money.  Otherwise it's just bits on a computer unable to even perform useful computations. 

&gt;Oh and in electronics other conductors can be used instead, so really it’s not even needed there if push came to shove.

Nope, unless you can show me a conductor that doesn't oxidize at the surface I doubt you'll be replacing it anytime soon. That's a property that's damn near impossible to come by without introducing materials that are highly toxic.

When I saw Bitcoin it sounded like it was proposing to be a solution to this problem.  I had trouble believing that it was possible to create a cryptographic currency, though - ""How could the currency be useful if people could just make more of it by copying the file that contained it?"" I thought.  I had actually considered this on my own (my background is computer science and engineering and I was familiar with asymmetric cryptography) but to me creating a copy-proof, inflation-proof, central-authority-free cryptographic currency was an unsolvable problem.

There were people on Slashdot urging naysayers to read the whitepaper, so I did.  I was blown away: Satoshi had solved the problem that mystified me.  Here was something the government could never get its hands on.  Here at last was the tool to smash the state.",1525124386

"&gt; this is an argument that SPV wallets cannot work if they severely outnumber full nodes. It only means centralization if miners are forced to serve SPV wallets but they are not.

If the overwhelming majority of people need to use SPV because full nodes need too much bandwidth, and SPV wallets can't work if they severely outnumber full nodes, then Bitcoin can't work if the overwhelming majority of people need to use SPV. Admittedly this is more of an argument against BCH than against your more reasonable (2X) proposal.

The Coindesk article also explains how SPV clients aren't as secure as full nodes, so ""forcing"" people to use SPV is a form of centralization. The famous [Cornell block size study](https://www.ccn.com/cornell-study-recommends-4mb-blocksize-bitcoin/) recommended 4MB to prevent losing too many full nodes, so now would be a nice time to repeat it with new data.

&gt; The small blockers need to prove that 2MB won't work because this is the actual debate not 8GB blocks 30 years in the future.

To be fair we _were_ talking about BCH just a second ago.

I liked how the community handled the Segwit2X split; announce it, let traders come to their own conclusions, and then start betting on chain split tokens. If it's worth more than the old version, then we should switch to the new fork. I agree that 2MB wouldn't automatically mean instant 100% centralization.

Personally my main objection to Segwit2x wasn't even the block size increase. They were:

* The Cornell study hadn't been repeated to prove _to us_ that it's _safe_, and 

* There was very little time to test it before/after releasing the hard fork code.

"&gt; No not at all

Yes completely, your statement repeats exactly what I said. Here you say:

&gt; You lock your bitcoins in a channel with a counterparty.

I said ""You lock your bitcoin up in an LN channel""

&gt; If you make a transaction

And what are you transacting?! I said ""and you get an LN token""

&gt; so if he chose to transmit this new channel state some of your bitcoins end up in his adress and the rest goes back to your adress.

""that needs to be turned back into a bitcoin.""

What do you mean leave the blockchain? 

&gt; and there is no token,ever.

There is a LN counterparty Value/Token/Coin/Note/Voucher/Sea shell counter (whatever you want to call this thing you say ""transacting""). That represents the amount of bitcoins in the channel that you will get once the channel is closed. Why is this so difficult for you to understand, you're not sending bitcoins but a representation of the bitcoins which is an LN-BTC counterparty token that's exchanged for Bitcoin.

"&gt; You want spending to happen, which will cause a decrease in a value, hence why inflation is actually a sign of a healthy economy. 

Inflation itself isn't a sign of a healthy economy. It will happen regardless of the economy health because there is always more of the currency being produced. However inflation must be monitored and regulated, because if it's not it can get out of control and destroy an economy.  (Zimbabwe is a note worthy example) Which is why Bitcoin put a cap on their currency, to create a deflationary currency. Meaning overtime it should steadily increase in value. Though Satoshi didn't plan for increasing adoption and speculative investing.

Spending shouldn't decrease the value of a currency. It can decrease it's value on relative terms. (If people quickly start buying gold. The value of gold relative to the currency will increase.) But if people are just buying groceries and going about their daily lives. Spending shouldn't have any impact on it's value because the people who received the currency are going to put the money right back into the economy. Of course that's just based on one economy.

Fees only go up when users have to compete with each other for their transaction to make the blocks. As long as there is enough room in the blocks for every single tx to make it the users don't have to compete for room and so the fees stay low. Miners can only raise the fees when all the miners together raise the fees but as soon as a new miner starts mining all the transactions with fees under their threshold then this miner is getting all the revenu and the other miners have no option to either mine lower fee tx or lose revenue!

Fees going up in 2017 on the Bitcoin-BTC chain was never intended to happen. It only happened as a result of never removing that 2010 spam protection limit. If you think that removing that spam protecion limit was a bad idea then go ahead and spam the BCH chain as much as you want.

Fraud is when you knowingly sell something that is not as described. The BTC blockchain is NOT called Bitcoin Core, which is the start of the deceit. The search description is “Buy Bitcoin” also the domain name is buy.bitcoin.com yet neither options are clear on what is actually Bitcoin. YOU might understand which is which, but the average Joe on the street won’t even know that Bitcoin Cash is a thing. Deliberately incorrectly naming Bitcoin and not even explaining the difference IS fraud. ",1525120330

&gt; 
&gt; If that isn't the very hand of the global banking cartel, I don't know what is. 

They don't have complete control yet. They would have to take control of mining first--and they haven't gotten that far. But they have made rumblings in that direction so we might see it soon. If they change the proof-of-work algo, that would boot every existing miner off of BTC, and they would have complete control of bitcoin.

If that happened, I can't imagine that the price of BTC wouldn't plummet catastrophically, so they need to make it happen in a way that it wouldn't. Surely they want to do this, Blockstream / Core has even talked about creating their own tamper-proof mining hardware and about changing the PoW.

But they will have to get Lightning / Liquid running I think before they can do that. And what they will likely do is establish a side-chain with their own mining equipment. Once that is running, they can switch Lightning over to their side-chain, decouple it from BTC and just run their own private blockchain with their private mining hardware. **Then BTC doesn't get replaced, it just dies on the vine.
**

They will have killed it, by neglect, not with a knife.

"An open long is someone who *at some point in the past* had positive market sentiment. It looks like that time, according to the charts, was March/April of 2018. 

A long position uses margin to buy XRP that they didn't have, by borrowing USD or BTC, respectively. They are paying interest to the person they borrowed from each day that their position is open.

For them to realize their profit (or loss, depending on when they entered position), and stop paying interest, they will, at some point have to close their position. Doing so is treated as a market order, and in order to close a long, they have to sell the XRP that they purchased to get back USD or BTC.

It is especially dangerous in volatile markets, because the market will automatically liquidate their position if the price changes to put them far enough under water. So if a decent sized whale pushed the XRP price down with a big market sell, many of these longs could be liquidated, forcing them to sell as well, setting up a cascade that pushes the price further and potentially triggering more liquidations.

A short is the same, where someone borrows XRP on margin to sell. In order to close a short position, they must purchase XRP from the market and give it back to the person they borrowed from.

So people have, in the past 2 months, have put VASTLY more money into buying XRP that they will, at some point sell. When those longs start to close, or if a whale starts a long squeeze, that value will flow out, and it will be interesting to see what happens.",1525118634

"Yes professional gambling is a thing and it is separate from investing. There is world of a difference between investing and gambling. The big difference between two is the following:

1. Investing usually has very low risk while gambling has very high risk. Basket of stocks give good consistent returns in long term. Gambling generally has very binary returns.
2. Expected value in investing is more than the money you put in. In gambling expected value is lesser than the money you put in.

Using the first criteria Bitcoin (like any single stock) is closer to gambling. Using the second criteria personally I believe it is closer to investing with good risk-return profile.",1525118368

Fees will lower at Paypal if crypto becomes the norm. However, they will never drop too low. For cryto to be accepted on-mass by consumers for payments online, there's going to need to be companies in place that help the consumers. 

Support, systems to handle chargebacks, disputes etc. All of these will require staff, offices, overheads etc and therefore will cost. 

It's all fine and dandy saying X coin is free to send and takes X millseconds. What people forget is that there will be a need for companies/services that are built on top of that, that will cost people and will add time to everything. 

Crypto will potentially lower costs, by how much though, is debatable.

"&gt; but do see Bitcoin as the coin that could render BCH useless IF certain things in the future occur, 

The only reason why BCH was created was because BTC was useless (at least as something that is used by a large amount of people). You think BCH had ever come to existence if BTC was actually functional?

&gt;Bitcoin is deliberately trying to be a great storage of value

No, actually it never was supposed to be that, it was Blockstream which took control over BTC and created this idea of ""store of value"". Which is something that btw doesn't make a whole lot of sense because nobody is gonna ""store"" their money inside something that could lose 15% of its value in a day.

&gt;Now Bitcoin Cash is not for massive transfers of money between govt’s,countries houses, etc

It can very well be used for that. People have done that with BTC when it had only a fraction of its current hashpower.

&gt;With that said the only other contender in the entire crypto space that stands a chance as currency is Monero.

The problem with Monero is that because of how the privacy of the coin works you need to have the whole blockchain to verify your transaction which makes it difficult to be used as a mobile wallet. Unless they have changed that, I haven't looked into it for a while.

The bottom line is this: I used to love BTC. I bought it in 2013 and it made me a lot of money. But BTC is now controlled by people who have little to do with the original developers and have done nothing good for Bitcoin. During the mempool disaster in 2017 I lost hundreds of dollars in transaction fees, this is just unacceptable and the LN still after all these years doesn't exist. I don't think BTC has a future.",1525118133

",1525117852
"&gt; You can question if one network has better integrity compared to the other network. It's a valid question..

Nakamoto consensus establishes the future reliability that a previous chain state will be recognized as legitimate. As a blockchain is meant to be indefinitely immutable, its integrity is intractably entwined with the consistency it can achieve. Only a chain built by the measured majority of capacity to perform the specific work required qualifies for high confidence in its future consistency that Nakamoto consensus promises

&gt; But you can't validate two networks based on the Nakamoto consensus rules.

The future consistency and integrity of even a majority chain is contingent on its continued dominance in work proof accumulation. In support of that assumption, the application of Nakamoto consensus allows two specific claims to be made of the majority chain that cannot be made of a minority chain:

1. There is no source of existent, compatible work capacity with the demonstrated capability to adversely affect the future consistency of the blockchain.

2. The blockchain contains sufficient evidence to validate that since its inception, it has attracted the majority of measured work capacity in pursuit of maintaining its future consistency.

Confidence in the future consistence of a chain produced by a minority of that capacity is _necessarily_ limited to no greater than that of the majority chain. That is to say, there _does exist_ a source of compatible work capacity with the demonstrated capability to adversely affect the consistency of a minority chain. Therefore the consistency, and thus integrity, of such a chain is contingent not on maintaining a majority it has not even managed to achieve, but rather on _a portion of the majority capacity_ (existent or future) not being utilized to adversely manipulate it.

&gt;Better use words like more or less hashpower when comparing two systems

Nakamoto consensus is achieved by comparing the relative hashpower of two or more systems. By its nature it is _exclusive_ to the system which can demonstrate the greatest accumulation of the relevant work proof. If two systems share a source of work capacity, only one can achieve Nakamoto consensus. The other may still be able to function in some capacity, perhaps even with substantial confidence. You can even call it bitcoin for all I care. But it is **not** the system described in Satoshi's white paper.",1525117849

Fiat will not save COSS. They failed to drive steady volume with crypto to crypto, while other exchanges were growing exponentially (ie: binance, kucoin, etc.). If that doesn't set off red flags, I don't know what does.

&gt; EOS token has no purpose, which is stated on the website lol

Ah this old line. Besides the necessity of the wording for legal reasons, of course, in its current form as an ERC-20 PLACEHOLDER token, this is true. And it's true for many other ICO tokens as well. You forgot to mention that once the EOS main net goes live in June, they will be converted into authentic EOS utility tokens that actually will actually have a real and valuable purpose. It's not your fault, most people can't read these days anyway.

With all that research you did i'm sure you understood the point of the year long ICO is to create the widest possible ownership distribution, which is great for all that decentralization we love. You understood that right??

&gt; EOS states that they are not designing EOS but rather contracted a crypto company to create it. The name being block.one, does this sound familiar? Well it should because they say they are very experienced, which btw they have not created a single product for anyone or any company. 

EOS is an opensource platform being created by a company called Block.one, which is headed up by Dan Larimer, one of the most successful developers, if not the most, in the world for real-world blockchain applications, which currently include Bitshares and Steemit. Perhaps you have heard of these? 

&gt; Of course this all makes sense because block.one is basically EOS in plain site, located in the cayman islands, so they are funneling in billions of tax free dollars from clueless people.

None of what you have said so far has made any kind of sense. 

&gt;  So first EOS is not designing its own product which is bad on it's own or EOS is a front. Block.one does not exist in any matter outside of EOS but is somehow a top blockchain company. So by this means looking at the site they post how block.one is investing millions into them, which is odd because i thought they were contracted to develop EOS.

I know what a herculean effort it is just to calculate cost basis on some of these CSV files (eh hemm, Forkdelta). Also, they have REAL crypto devs like Mr. Salemi, handling your data for the initial on-boarding process, to deal with trade history formatting.  And no, I'm not an ad-bot; I am a real crypto-trader and these are real people. They hosted a very informative webinar last month for their clients, so that you know you're dealing with legit professionals in the crypto-accounting business.  I will definitely be using happy-tax/crypto-tax prep next year. Thank you, guys and gals!  Now, my IRS worries are behind me. ",1525115881

"&gt; Lol a bitcoin bank? Isnt that what the hardcore bitcoin users are against?

No we're not against the concept of banking in general. We're against the current existing banks that are essentially an extension of the US government, who profit on government inflation and are against adoption of bitcoin because it will cut into their current death-grip on transaction fees.

The kind of banks that would arise after we win, that would use crypto, would be allies, adopters of crypto. We'd be perfectly happy to deal with such people.

Disagree. It certainly has the potential to do so. You're speaking the language of the basic bitch opportunist. Most of us early adopters didn't get into this to get rich, but because of its potential for world financial revolution, including the end of fiat. If that wasn't a realistic possibility, we wouldn't have begun the journey.

&gt;The longest chain with the most work is what matters.    

To you perhaps. I, and many others, care about the chain being valid. The issue is determining which chain is valid as you haven't been around to watch consensus ebb and flow. If you tried to enforce the rules as they were before you went into the coma you would likely be operating on a network which no longer had consensus and would be an alt-coin.

"Ok I got 2 worst trades: 

1.  I cashed out from a poker site with BTC back in early 2017.  It was the first time I've held any crypto I was extremely weary of it, but as you may know, online poker is illegal in US so it is a bitch cashing out any other way - previously I would have to wait 6 weeks for a check to arrive which was written from some bogus company for golf supplies or something stupid like that and it would literally give me instructions on what to say or not say to the bank teller if they asked me about the check.  Ok, so I get 2 BTC and just planned on immediately exchanging for fiat, but I decided to just hold it to see if it went anywhere.  I think 1 BTC was about $1100.  Within a few days the priced dropped to about $950 and I said 'fuck this' and cashed out.  Fast forward to Mid December...    

2.  I'm kicking myself because of how much the 2 BTC would've been worth.  I get interested in crypto as an investment but remember how December was?  I was fomo'ing hard.  I bought the ""dip"" 5 LTC at like $330.  That has turned out to be not so great.

Nah, if crypto took over as a world currency it would become what's known as our 'unit of account.' 

The reason we measure crypto in fiat currently is because that fiat is our unit of account.

It's not particularly difficult to switch units of account, mentally. Just takes some getting used to. It's no different than visiting another country and getting a feel for how expensive things are there.

"
Look at ETH.
What makes it worth the $300 it is today?
Smart contracts
They are revolutionary. Don't know why? Google it. You will find all sorts of uses for them, from Finance, Insurance companies, Airlines, you name it. There is a problem however, which is probably slowing down ETH's growth. Right now, smart contracts on the Ethereum network are limited; it's confined within the blockchain and with data on the blockchain.
Chainlink changes that.
All of those potential uses for Smart Contracts - that's all now a very legitimate possibility now. In the simplest terms, Chainlink allows for external data to inform smart contracts. When you consider the fact that it's decentralised, it gets a whole lot better.
People that keep saying things like ""why would banks use chainlink when they can just make their own version"" clearly don't understand the fundamentals of this project. Chainlink's goal is not to ""be used"" like (e.g.) Ripple hopes to achieve.
Chainlink is merely the bridge that enables data which is outside of the Ethereum 'universe', to communicate with it, and thus execute various actions. Thus, it's not unlikely that adopters will use their own private blockchain (biggest reason would be to avoid the market fluctuations in it's value). But - what will they use to get their data, onto the blockchain - whether it be their own token, eth, etc... Chainlink.
 
1. Eth and smartcontracts. We all know smartcontracts are revolutoinary, but their use cases are limited. Smartcontracts are awesome, but they are confined within the blockchain and data on the blockchain. In otherwords, right now smartcontracts are ""you send 1 eth and I'll send back 1000 McTokens"", and this contract is verifiable/trustless/amazing but its stuck within the universe of Ethereum and the data Ethereum understands
 
2. It is possible to use external data to inform these contracts, but right now that process is centralized. This is a problem. Lets say the external data is a transaction of Dollars for ETH. So you send 300$ to bank account X, and then I send one Eth to your address. Right now you either do that through a third party (CoinBase), OTC (LocalBitcoins) or whatever else centrlized system you want to use.
 
Knocking out that centralization, where you have to trust someone, is THE key to SmartContracts having a real world use case. But how do you get that information -- the fact that the $300 has been sent -- onto the blockchain using data that the smartcontract understands?
 
3. Oracles. Right now the answer is ""hey we can hire Oracle X to do the translation to represent this bank dollar transaction on the blockchain."" The ""oracle problem"" with this is that you are 100% TRUSTING that oracle to act prudently. That they don't tamper with the data. So we can kill coinbase but now we have to trust the oracle instead of coinbase .This is a HUGE problem for Banks who want to get into blockchain but have to trust a centralized oracle to translate data. This Oracle can be hacked, falsified, defrauded, really all the problems that come with centralization.
4. ChainLink - this service DECENTRALIZES that translation process of the Oracle. Now, the translation is trustless, and you have a trustless data feed that informs the trustless smart contract.
 
Multibillion dollar institutions can rely on distributed blockchain technology and know the data that informs their smart contracts is tamperproof.
 
So Thats what ChainLink does. ChainLink is the first decentralized Oracle that allows anyone to securely provide smart contracts with access to external data, off-chain payments, and really literally any other API you can dream up. Confirmation of delivery of an items (RFID, like Walton), confirmation of a wire being sent or received, interest rates from any central bank, sports scores, product/machine uptime, price of Eth/BTC in real time, weather patterns etc. Right now smart contracts are simple if/then functions where you go and manually do the if so the then comes back. Now with Oracles smartcontracts can automatically confirm or deny if then statements without any human interaction. Transactional automation for agreed upon terms on steroids.

"Personally I find it confusing and kinda sketchy. I get dollars taken out of my paycheck, _somebody_ does _something_ (that I can't verify), and then someone snail mails me a pie graph saying I now own this balance of these mutual funds. I don't know how to verify that someone else doesn't also ""own"" the same shares. I can't withdraw it and put it all back in again without paying a penalty. Changing anything requires I fill out a bunch of paperwork, unless _they're_ changing something, in which case they send me a letter filled with verbose yet vague legalese, with no option to refuse all changes except _me_ filling out more paperwork to roll it over.

I realize that most people are never going to understand one system more than the other, but to me at least it means a lot that I can audit any part of a cryptocurrency from the paper trail down to the source code. I need to _see_ how it works and have a wide variety of third-party tools available. I can hold it in my hand and easily follow it all the way back to the day it was created.

For most of my life I thought my problem was with finance in general, that it was all promises and lies and schemes. I was so discouraged by the initial assumptions that I though the whole thing was a scam. Then when Bitcoin came out, I kept finding myself saying ""OK that makes sense"", and started actually learning about finance.

I don't care about Paypal fraud protections, or anyone's fraud protections, as a seller, getting my own money is much more important. Do I want fraud ? No, but I NEED a reliable way to get paid, and Paypal isn't it, or at least can't be 100 % of it, in case their computer decides I'm a bad guy, even though I have 1000 feedback, 100 % positive, which is in and of itself rather absurdly good, even for a legit Ebay seller, but they don't care.

"How will we ever reach mass adoption if using the coins currently in the US is a taxable event? The only solution I can think of is having advanced wallets that can will prompt you how much you paid for the coins when you receive it. A better way would be, say you move funds from coinbase to your wallet.  If it can send an off chain memo to your wallet with the cost info so it can be behind the scenes. The goal will be at the end of every year you can get how much you owe in tax every year automatically.

"Well, I don't like the first tweet either. BCH is not about innovation (what Bitcoin was the first 4 years), BCH is about sticking old roadmap. ",1525113717
"Explaining the propaganda of this image: 

Price in USD - How much the free market values each coin: 

- Bitcoin reached 20k during this period, further, cryptocurrencies are still very new, and arguably in a price discovery phase still. Price is still the value the free market assigns to a commodity. To this, what matters is the actual price. By putting the percentage really big, and the actual price smal, it implies that the percentage is the more important marker in terms of value. The free market right now believes btc is more valuable than bch, but this chart would have you believe otherwise. 

Mining Power - The amount of computing power securing the network:

Again, we have the percentages real big, and the actual number real small. This is trying to make the point that more miners are ""switching"" to bch, when in reality miners can mine both, and will switch between what is more profitable. When we look at the actual numbers, we see 29.9 exa/s for btc, vs 3.7 exa/s for bch. btc clearly has more mining power

Transactions per day - how much the network is being used

Again, we see the percentages big and the real number small. But this metric really exposes the propaganda. There has been a large increases in batching transactions among big entities who push large amounts of tx on the blockchain. This means, they send 1 transactions with a lot of transactions on it. This lowers the amount of ""transactions per day"", but it isn't an accurate representation. For example, 1 transaction can send to 50 addresses. It shows up as 1 transaction, but includes 50. The propaganda shines bright in this metric. Then you look at the real numbers: 211,440 tx/day for btc, and 23,085 for bch. 

Active Wallets - how many unique wallets are using the network each day:

Again, the raw numbers show a large disparity with btc having way more wallets. It is also interesting to note, the run up to 20k had all kinds of regular people entering the market for the first time for investment purposes. Transaction batching could also have an affect on the number of wallets. There is also something that should be mentioned, 1 wallet does not equal 1 person. I for example, have many wallets. This metric tries to imply that wallet = person without saying it. 

Capacity added on the blockchain - How much each network has improved its maximum capacity: 

This is another metric where we can see the propaganda shine. Both metrics have 0%, but bch has a * next to it. At the bottom we see * = bitcoin cash will increase its capacity 300% on may 15th. They could have done the same thing for bitcoin, which has future plans to increase network capacity, but conveniently left it out of the chart. 

Capacity added using sidechains - how much capacity has been added beyond the mainchain: 

So for this metric they used the lightning network, which is a very young technology that shows A LOT of future potential. What they are trying to imply without saying it, is that LN is already mature and useless, when the protocol is being actively developed and will provide immense benefit to the network. 

That's all for my propaganda exposing post.",1525113660

"I mine, and yes I agree with you that those miners that continued to mine the BTC chain, did indeed achieve majority consensus. I even mined segwit acceptance briefly, albeit signalling for the NYA that wanted the 2mb fork after segwit as a “compromise”. Core refused this path and the devs that had the 2mb client pulled it at the last minute. While I’ll absolutely agree majority consensus was achieved, it was highly controversial. I believe there was something like 90% voting for the 2mb upgrade so it was certainly contentious in the sense that it achieved consensus conditionally, and those conditions were then not met. Once segwit was locked in and it was clear the NYA was dead, the bch fork happened and the rest is history.",1525113279

e. reduce ""hops"" (purchase ltc/eth/btc) on coinbase &gt; purchase on 2nd exchange such as binance (fee to purchase and to send). Then transfer from binance to another exchange or wallet (another fee). That is a minimum of three fees/overhead costs.

"Bitcoin has its own economical use case, as does Bitcoin Cash and they do not overlap or threaten each other, which is why I support both, but do see Bitcoin as the coin that could render BCH useless IF certain things in the future occur, and not the opposite way around. Bitcoin is deliberately trying to be a great storage of value (which is first needed to be good money) and its purpose in the economy is to be the marker and transfer of large value between let’s say countries and govt’s etc... When fiat slowly disappears a coin will then be valued by its demand for goods and services, so with that said Bitcoin’s demand is that it is the marker for all price to gauge their valuation (including currencies), so everything in the world that can be priced, including currencies, are themselves indeed the goods and services that give valuation to Bitcoin. Now Bitcoin Cash is not for massive transfers of money between govt’s,countries houses, etc... Technically and the regulations purposely written within the code if you philosophize properly are specifically being created so that BCH is to be used like digital cash and in commerce. Last time I checked, commerce and cash power the global economy, and not storage of value. They serve two entirely different purposes from an economic standpoint rendering their battle entirely useless. One must remember that BCH could essentially be used as a testnet for Bitcoin to see what works and doesn’t, and with “empirical evidence” at that point, which is why Bitcoin could render BCH useless and not the opposite way around. With that said the only other contender in the entire crypto space that stands a chance as currency is Monero. The real question that comes in to play is, do the people want default-privacy and optional transparency or do they want default-transparency and optional privacy. That will be a trillion+ dollar questions probably. Could Monero render BCH and BTC entirely useless.... If you only look at the technicals you will not figure out much. The industry is open-source, so use that to your advantage and study the code (if you can) and try to piece together which code is being created for what purpose and regulations now or later and what will be this coin’s and this code’s economical purpose in society. If you just listen to non-technical people arguing on Reddit about what they’re read then chances are you’ll join the division team and become one sided, like politics. Be independent, know everything, make your own choices and not other peoples. For all of these economical reasons I support both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash as well as Monero. ",1525112967

"I understand exactly what is being stated here: a group of central planners are celebrating their success in forcing artificially high fees on the Bitcoin network. Core and Blockstream have long stated that their intent for onchain transactions is massively high fees with a large backlog in transactions. This is not miners/nodes setting the minimum fees they will accept for transactions, but a group of developers dictating how much block space miners can produce. 

Contrast this to Satoshi's description of a fee market:

&gt;I don’t anticipate that fees will be needed anytime soon, but if it becomes too burdensome to run a node, it is possible to run a node that only processes transactions that include a transaction fee. The owner of the node would decide the minimum fee they’ll accept. Right now, such a node would get nothing, because nobody includes a fee, but if enough nodes did that, then users would get faster acceptance if they include a fee, or slower if they don’t. The fee the market would settle on should be minimal. If a node requires a higher fee, that node would be passing up all transactions with lower fees. It could do more volume and probably make more money by processing as many paying transactions as it can. **The transition is not controlled by some human in charge of the system though, just individuals reacting on their own to market forces.**",1525112681

"It's actually worse than a ""currency controlled by Chinese miners"".  In the case of BCH, it's centrally controlled together by the Chinese miners (Jihan's team) and Roger Ver himself.  Take a look at the following quote by Roger Ver regarding fees:

Remember folks, decentralization can only occur if the protocol developers and the miners DO NOT collude.

"That's why I specified just giving them a 10 and telling them to keep the change in my example of a situation where crypto is slower.  This isn't even getting into software or device glitches that can cause hangups and delays.  Not that those things happen frequently, but a phone being slow or a battery dying certainly happens more frequently than a $10 note suddenly being worthless. 

Credit cards are probably the closest 1-to-1 comparison of the crypto process. You pull it out of your wallet, swipe or insert it, and you're on your way... Unless the reader mis-reads it, or the system is acting sluggish, or any number of other things that can go wrong with complex technology (even complex tech that seems simple to the user).  (Note: Just in case you're in the EU or something, not all credit card transactions require signatures or pins - most of my CC purchases are literally just swiping a card.) Heck, one of the local sports stadiums even had their entire credit and debit processing systems crash for an hour just before the game, and there I was getting my food with cash while almost everyone else was in line to use the ATM.

At the end of the day, what I'm getting at is that no one system will always be 100% effective for 100% of situations. If it works for every situation you get yourself in, awesome, more power to you, but that doesn't mean everyone gets into the same situations and it doesn't mean that it's a flawless system.  I am certainly excited for it, and I hope it gets as big as we expect it to, I'm just a hardcore realist when it comes to new tech on a worldwide scale.  

By comparison, a couple years ago people were talking about how Tesla's Auto Pilot could be used by everyone within 5 years, and was already nearly flawless, and how I was insane for saying it still had a long ways to go.

As for the takeover of the core team, it's possible, but I think some people there just genuinely have a different vision, or are just outright nuts (Luke Jr.).  

While I of course prefer BCH over BTC and have swapped a lot of my holdings over to it, I am pretty skeptical that it has actually fixed the vulnerability.  Bitcoin's consensus mechanism failed, and BCH while it fixed the technical issue at the moment, it only slightly modified the consensus mechanism and only in regard to that one variable.  I am really disappointed that more hasn't been done to fix this.

My current pick for a good solution is Dash.  They have the same scaling solution (at least short term) as the Masternodes have voted to increase blocksize to keep the transaction fee below 1 US cent.  They also have a consensus mechanism that insures those with a vested interest in the network are the ones making decisions and not just whoever is loudest.  We also get to know for sure what support levels are.  That blocksize vote was 80% in favor.  The Dash network can be polled so people can see what it intends to do.  The masternode system also pays it's nodes completely eliminating any possibility that they could loose too many of them, and it enables instant transactions, something that means a lot for POS.

I was hopeful that BCH would adopt some of these concepts, as I think it's failure to do so will inevitably result in another consensus issue, especially if it manages to depose BTC as the largest coin.

So for the moment I see BCH the less technically viable but larger of the two best candidates for the digital cash use case.  

Neither of these coins are sole saviors of the threat to central banking.  There are a great many forks of Bitcoin and more can be made at any time.  The cat is out of the bag and central banks will have competition from one coin or another, it's wasn't all on BTC, and it isn't all on BCH now.  ",1525111907

"Your reference to ETH/ETC is a straw man. The issue is not about which can arbitrarily be called the ""original"", so there's no reason to respond to that question. The issue is conflation; Bitcoin is a known quantity, as demonstrated by a near entirety of outlets, vendors, wallets, exchanges and users referring to it exclusively as ""Bitcoin"". No caveat, qualifier or disclaimer required. Not ""Bitcoin Core"", or any other equivocation. 

What DOES require a qualifier? Bitcoin Cash, if one wanted to claim it was Bitcoin. That's the difference right there; ""BCH is Bitcoin"" is an assertion made *against* the consensus view, ""BTC is Bitcoin"" is never asserted at all, because it's redundant, because the truth of the statement is self-evident. Everyone knows it already.

&gt; My point is that which chain gets to use the Bitcoin name is a social construct. if 99% of Bitcoin users had supported increasing the blocksize via hard fork, that upgraded chain would have kept the Bitcoin name. 

No, not merely a social construct. Again, you seem to think consensus is simply a process of arriving at a name. If 99% of users supported any change, by default it would be adopted by an equivalent percentage of the outlets mentioned above. It's easy to claim that BCH is Bitcoin, just words. It's a much different story when that claim has to be put into actual *practice*, in the real world where liabilities are real and binding. The nature of consensus in a nutshell. Words vs actions.

 There has to be some major advantage to use another coin over btc. Btc is already popular, cheap, and fast. Theres just no reason for these other coins.

"Reply by Warren Buffett's fan, CFA, MBA and an investor..

Warren Buffett is right that Bitcoin does not fulfill his investment philosophy but it does not mean that it is a bad investment. 

15 years back even Amazon would not have fulfilled his investment philosophy and would be a 'gamble' as per his philosophy but that does not make Amazon a bad investment.

The way I and most other people view Bitcoin is that it is not a 100% guaranteed return opportunity but an investment where risk-adjusted return is very high.  There is more than 10% chance bitcoin's value going up by more than 10 folds, 1% chance bitcoin's value going up 100 folds. Even if there is 80-90% chance bitcoin value going to near zero, Bitcoin value is significantly less than it's expected value in future.

EV = Sum of (Probability*Future Values) = 1%*1,000,000 +10%*100,000+89%*0 = $20,000

Giving the risk-return odds in bitcoin it is advisable to invest an amount one is comfortable losing.

Also, Buffet's argument of how farms have value even if they are not traded and comparison with Bitcoin is flawed. Bitcoin has characteristics of commodity (gold) and currency which by it's inherent nature requires exchanging hands. If currency is not allowed to be exchanged, it is nothing more than a piece of paper. 

If I had Billion dollars or even few millions to invest, I would completely follow Warren Buffett's risk-averse investment philosophy but unfortunately I do not have the millions to invest so a 10% annualized returns would make me rich in 10-20 years. But Bitcoin offers me a 10% chance to be rich or lose it all. I like the odds and want to take that 'gamble'!",1525109680

Whether you like it or not, some 99.99% of the people, when they hear Bitcoin, they don't want Bitcoin Cash, they want Bitcoin. You can explain why you believe Bitcoin Cash is better, you can run aggressive marketing campaigns, you can do all of this and more. But what you cannot do is to deliver Bitcoin cash to someone who clicked the button ""Buy Bitcoin"". Well, you can... but don't be surprised if you end up in jail for fraud.

If they implement the changes tomorrow it goes to zero maybe. If they wait 1 more year then there are enough projects that use BCH so it has its own ecosystem. Also in order for BCH to get to 0 people need to sell it. I doubt that the current BCH holders will rush to sell for BTC because the dev tram had a change of heart. Also your assumption that BTC devs will ever let the blocksize increase enough to support non-LN usage is in my opinion incorrect. I estimate that the chances are less than Satoshi dumping his coins.,1525109600

It is only political, the facts when considered clearly indicate one should do both simultaneously.

So no not just 5 but the the intier IRC chat is rejecting discusion. 

&gt;Don't be so black and white. Almost every developer supports an eventual blocksize increase.

this was true in 2014 when this debate started it's not anymore. 

Listen to them ask them all have comited to the imutable consesus rules of whitch 1MB is on of them. I would never have suported the fork if there were developers who held my views. 

&gt;Bitcoin cash is a minority fork, not an upgrade. The term upgrade is an opinion.

control the narrative, and you control how people think. BCH is a split that resulted from an upgrade, those who did not upgrade don't have to do anything their Bitcoin is secure when they are ready they can spend it. **There is one consensus mechanism it's not my or your opinion,** it's PoW, and the upgrade is still a work in progress.

"You are right that BTC is more difficult to attack as opposed to chains with lesser hashrates. But with the lion's share of hashrate also comes the bigger price making it proportionally more profitable to attack.

That's why smaller chains are still relatively safe. There's less economic incentive to attack.

But while all that is true it doesn't implicate a right of existence for some network or rightful claim to the Bitcoin name.

Imagine - for example - China disconnects itself from our internet. It would cause a network split. There would become two Bitcoin networks. Now years later China reconnects. That doesn't mean we can simply discard one of those chains entirely just because it had less work. Both chains contain legitimate transactions. Both chains would need to exist.

It's important for people to remember BTC is ultimately a currency, and not a stock.

The less volatile BTC is, the less people will use it as an investment opportunity, and more for it's original purpose.

Realistically though the model shown in section 2 of the WP is fundamentally different than SegWit BTC, and is not different than BCH, so it's hard for me to even see BTC as Bitcoin, as defined as a chain of digital signatures.
2. I don't accept this argument, if bitcoin fees were a million dollars, it would still be a ""p2p electronic cash system"" according to your definition. Your argument is just wordplay, most old bitcoiners know that if the txn fees were greater than VISA processing fees or txn capacity was less than VISA txn capacity, then it would be unlikely for BTC to adopted as a cash system. $50 fees at this point in BTC's development is a bad joke and anyone defending such fees should be closely scrutinized. This wordplay feels awfully similar to ""SegWit is not a blocksize increase"" - yet I can push a 3.7MB block and SegWit is defined as a blocksize increase.
3. Satoshi's blocksize limit was temporary for flood control and was always intended to be raised, as evidenced by his comments both on forums and in the code base.
EDA: The EDA was an emergency stopgap, like the 1MB blocksize limit, and was quickly replaced by the DAA. The EDA was necessary to be rushed, as was the 1MB blocksize limit, in order to safely hardfork before a critical attack on the BTC chain could be made (SegWit softfork attack in the former case, flood attack in the latter).

All contemporaneous archives, without exception, support that finding. Even the arguably most major proponent of the UAHF, Jihan Wu, advised not to conflate Bitcoin Cash with Bitcoin.

The ""closest chain to the original"" is a non sequitur. Though you're right that Roger's position is based on such subjective nonsense. The historical record is clear, however ",1525102890
"Well yes, most of these projects will fail. Everyone should expect this. It's an entirely new technolgy &amp; market, and you're seeing 1000s of projects trying to capitalize on it.

Dot com bubble is appropriate. However, Amazon, Priceline and Ebay and a bunch of other success stories came out of it - the same will happen with blockchain. 

&gt; Ok so exchanges or platforms that have their own coin, why?

Like I said, you have to look at each individual project and see what they are about. Exchange coins are a no-brainer...exchanges offer a coin that incentivizes trading on that coin. Usually the incentive is reduced exchange fees. So on Binance, if you trade via BNB instead of Ethereum, you save 50% on trade fees. When that exchange is pushing 100s of millions of dollars, that coin becomes highly valuable. 

If you're asking ""why do platforms have their own coin"", ask yourself, why do companies have their own stocks? And why do people buy stocks? You are investing in that specific platform or project because you believe it will be successful. It's no different than investing in any other asset, except of course that these assets are **incredibly** risky, and many are potentially worthless. 

Also - not everything is a platform or an exchange. Across the 2000 coins, you have projects that are extremely broad - i.e. the Ethereum platform. Consider that like Android or iOS...where hundreds of projects can be built on that platform. Then you have very particular aspects of a platform. For example, GAS - this is the fee token for the NEO platform. Not all platforms require something like GAS, but there's a reason it has it, and a reason others don't. Too long to explain here.

Then you have something like ENJ, or GAME or GTC, which are tokens / coins related to gaming or casinos. Then you have Civic or SelfKey, which are specifically for identity authorization / verification across many platforms. Then you have something like PowerLedger, which is all about brining blockchain specifically to the power grid. Then you have Oyster (PRL) which is related to data storage and advertising. Then Golem (GNT) which is about sharing / networking computer power across users. Then you have, BAT, which is the token of the Brave internet browser. Brave is trying to solve the problem of how to retain privacy online (i.e. blocking ads, tracking, etc.) while still allowing financial compensation to content creators. This is one of my favorite projects - created by the guy behind Javascript and Firefox. 

FunFair is a token for online casinos. Factom is decentralized record keeping / inventory. ARK is all about bridging various blockchain platforms. IOTA is about internet of things - i.e. bringing blockchain to connected hardware / software devices...example: robotics &amp; automation. Bitcoin, Litecoin, Monero are all more strictly about exchanging money. 

I could go on for 100 pages with the hundreds and hundreds of coins / tokens / projects. Yes, some of them are bullshit. Some are scams. Some are forks of an idea, where developer teams have gone in different directions. Some, even if they are successful &amp; useful, may not have much monetary value. Some are potential a financial goldmine, and may form the foundation of much of how we exchange money, data and goods / service in the future.

This is a massive ecosystem of ideas. It's extremely volatile, and still basically in its infancy. If you are actually interested, I suggest reading up a bit on what blockchain is first. Then perhaps look at the top 20 coins / tokens on the market and see what they are all trying to achieve, and why they are different. Or skip all that and wait till it evolves a little more before getting more interested.",1525102880
"Bitcoin was the original name for a digital currency. Therefore I still consider every crypto that tries to be currency, to be Bitcoin or at least from Bitcoin. In the same way as the tree of life. When Bitcoin was the only coin it made sense to talk like this, but now it's confusing. That being said lots of crypto currencies are not trying to be currency ... so I think the name cryptocurrency is a bad name. 

Of course the more different crypto currencies there are, the harder it will become for one to go global. If everybody in crypto would all support and use the same crypto as currency ... but then again the cryptos that are supported as a way of making payment are only a handful.  For speculation it really does not matter.

&gt; They can't hold back Bitcoin forever. If they continue to strangle it resulting in more fees, eventually there will be ledger based forks that have higher capacity.

"OK... I'll bite. 

/u/Falkvinge, after SO many years in Bitcoin, your understanding of the entire set up is just appalling. Of course you think it all makes sense in your head, you are starting from *broken premises*! And as it goes in CS, GIGO...

But let's go in order, I actually took notes on the gibberish you talk about.

The TL;DR is, to quote yourself:

&gt;This is fucking bullshit

&amp;nbsp;

**1 - SPVs are 2^nd class citizens**

The first thing to say... of course they are. But let's clarify. This does not mean **people** using SPVs are less worthy as human beings, or anything even remotely like that. It simply means that an SPV user must *trust* what others are feeding them... and consequently, this trust can be betrayed. SPVs are ""gullible"" compared to their ""full nodes"" cousins, *who CANNOT BE cheated* upon. 

&gt; Email, email servers, nodes and the rest

If you don't understand the difference between email and Bitcoin, then may the Gods of cryptography bless you, because history will certainly be unapologetic with you.

Not everything in life requires the same level of participation. There are ""levels of trust"" in everything we do in life, and some things need lees trust than others. If you spoof/leak/modify my emails, unless I'm a drug dealer, I will get annoyed, sure. But even a leaked *dick pic* is not the end of the world. It certainly doesn't impact the country at large. However, printing money with impunity *DOES* impact the country at large. And this is why I want to minimize, ideally **completely eliminate** any trust element from my money. An SPV relies on trust all the time.

Will there be many people running SPVs? Probably. And that is true today. But it is NOT a given that one day most users could not be full nodes. How? Small blocks for another 5yrs, or more, tech improves, run full node on mobile phone... which will sync in, say, 1hr. Tech advances, right? So this scenario is most certainly realistic.

&gt;People have no interest in running a full node

This is both true and false. It is true because it is true for obvious reasons. But it is also false when you think about *what people really* want. And what people really want is to use Bitcoin (or any other tech, for that matter) with no fuss. People are not against running an email server because they are *against running one*, but simply because it's too much of a mess. Now what if running a full node was just as simple as running an SPV is? Yep, that's right... people would run full nodes! And how could that happen? Small blocks and full nodes on mobile phones, for instance. And during the installation of the app, it would only ask you

* Install full client (Recommended)

* Install light client (Only if you know what you are doing!)

Now pray tell what will the average user end up doing??? 

Another way... Every. Single. New. Machine. Comes. With. Pre-installed. Full. Nodes??? And because blocks are small, it only takes a short time to fully validate?? You do it once, as part of your general new toy set up, and you're good to go!

It's about ease of use, not about ""refusing to run a server"".



&amp;nbsp;

**2 - Nodes have network power**

&gt;In a football game, nodes are spectators

Absolutely false. Could not be more false. Completely broken analogy, I'm guessing arising from the fact that you don't understand the role of full nodes. And are trying to force an analogy onto something you do know. But this is forced, hence inaccurate.

Full nodes validate every single transaction and reject the invalid ones. In a football game this doesn't exist!! If you want to come up with a new, enhanced, football game... it would be like having thousands of refs, each and every one validating/vetting the decisions of the main refs. Yes, the main refs are still the one running the show, but if they start privileging one team over the other, they are **removed from the refereeing**! Because full nodes, non-mining ones at that, ENFORCE the rules and ban peer who produce invalid blocks!

Non mining full nodes are like bouncers to a club - They cannot sell you the tickets, but they can certainly prevent you from getting into the club if you have a fake ticket. And it doesn't matter that the PR guy/gal selling tickets is WAAAAAY more popular than the bouncer, if the bouncer sees a fake ticket you are not getting in, despite the fact they are completely passive in the sale of tickets. End of story. You should think about this, it will clear your confusion about full nodes.

SPVs, on the other hand, are true spectators, yes. And thus completely unable to do anything about anything. Like an ATM.



&amp;nbsp;

**3 - Nodes decentralize the network**

This is perhaps the worst part...

&gt; Decentralization --&gt; ""No description of what the word means""

This is so bad. Just because you cannot define something, it does not mean you cannot, intuitively, have a pretty damn good understanding of what it is. Example: How many of your viewers can **define the colour blue**?? Can **YOU** define the colour blue? Maybe you can, maybe you cannot... but I'm pretty fucking positive that you know damn well what blue is and you can tell blue from green from red from yellow and so on.

I tell people ""centralization vs decentralization is like a dinosaur vs a swarm of bees"". They get it instantly. Maybe it'll help you as well.

&gt; Decentralization is not quantified, not measured.

One, see comment above. Two, I don't need to ""measure/quantify"" the stars in the Universe, or the grains of sand on Earth, to claim there's ""very fucking many"". Three, perhaps /u/el33th4xor can enlighten you on actually measuring decentralization.

The best for last...

&gt; Comcast is not an argument

AU FUCKING CONTRAIRE!!! Comcast is **THE** argument.

You see, when designing cars and car security, engineers don't design cars for the smoothest, best possible roads in the world, and for the best drivers. Nope. No way. Instead, they design cars for the worst possible case! But it's not only cars, this is true for every single engineering product on Earth! Specifications are not specifications to use the product in the best case scenario, but in the WORST possible scenario.

OK, small self correction... specifications tell you what is the worst possible case scenario under which you can use it. But the point in case doesn't change - You must take care of the worst possible case, not the best one. And if Bitcoin is to become truly **global**, I guess Comacast might well be the fucking worst case scenario!

**Extra - Mathematical proof**

I lied above... Comcast was not the last, but I didn't lie that the best is for last. Your alleged *mathematical proof* that blocks can be extended for ever. I don't even need to see this ""proof"", and can tell you immediately it's bullshit. Follow my proof:

`\sum X_n n = 1 to \infinty = \infinity`

for any positive and finite `X_n` that does not depend on `n`. That is, `X_n = X &gt;0`. This means that a blockchain, even with 1MB blocks (!!!), is bound to become **infintely large** when time goes to infinity... aka ""for ever"". No physical system can contain ""infinite"" amounts of data. `Q.E.D.`

"Hi Oscar, the criticisms of segwit are easy to be found if you do your research. Looking at segwit alone you may not think much of it, you have to compare it against alternative solutions to see what a let down it is. Again, it’s not the technical implementation of segwit that’s being criticised here. In fact, a large part of the critique against segwit is how it was deployed, via a contentious soft fork that forced the bch hardfork in order to protect against the forced upgrade that are inherent in softforks. Not to mention the time it took to develop and the necessity to implement vast changes across the ecosystem that *still* isn’t complete, all due to the lack of leadership and direction from the bitcoin core team in deploying a clean and simple hardfork to achieve the same goals. As segwit was ultimately sold as a blocksize increase it begs the question why we didn’t, as a community, simply hardfork to 4mb 2 years ago. We could discuss further what a technical design hack it is, the necessity of segwit for layer 2 solutions etc. It’s also completely morally senseless to deploy a soft fork praising how this allows people “choice”, and then lynching those who don’t want it.

At the end of the day, the whole mess was avoidable and many of us are left simply astonished as to how poorly handled everything was. ",1525101415

"Broadcasting a double spend is easy, actually having it pull through is hard.

I once sent a transaction with a very low fee before replace by fee existed, and it got stuck for a few hours, so I double spent that transaction with another transaction using the same coins but to a different address with a higher fee. It confirmed in about 20 minutes and bam, double spent complete. Obviously if you were trying to double spend a merchant you would make the double spend a really high fee, like 10-100x the original fee.

So it's definitely possible. I am sure some clients have more double spend detection than they used, but the basic principle is still the same.

&gt; Realistically, how could someone double spend a 0-conf tx? First off, singing the transaction is pretty hard without exposing your private keys.

You're not exposing your private keys, you're just signing and then broadcasting another transaction with the same private key. Nothing is exposed.

&gt; Wallets wont let you send the same coins twice.

There are some command line tools that can craft raw tx and broadcast. Obviously the core client won't let you do this. But raw tx crafting is possible (but dangerous, as everything from an input not allocated to an address becomes the fee. People have lost thousands of bitcoin this way.)

&gt; Even if you manage to sign a double spending transaction, propagating it doesn't seem to work well either. I tried it once. All broadcasting services give a ""mempool conflict error"".

I think that might be because the clients are smarter now than they used to be. Back when I tried (3 years ago) I had no issue. It showed up on the blockchain.info website as a double spend but after my second tx went through everything was good. 

&gt; I was able to broadcast the double spending transaction but most nodes rejected it and it wasnt visible on any block explorers. 

Perhaps the core client and the one the miners use has better double spend detection capabilities? I'm a bit of a Bitcoin old timer. :p

If so that is a good thing and makes accepting 0 conf a possibility.

&gt; but microtransactions could be accepted with 0-conf (if sufficient fee is added)

I agree with this. :)

"&gt;As soon as fiat/crypto conversion will be easier (by easier I mean cheaper, faster) then it literally doesn't matter which currency you're using for spending since they're interchangeable.

Why will it be? Any fiat trade has to go through fiat infrastructure, so unless that gets easier and cheaper (undermining the utility of cryptos) its not likely to get any cheaper, especially as more regulations in the crypto space increase cost of managing transactions.

The % I quoted don't include on-chain fees, so even if they went down to 0, it would still be 1-4%

&gt;But even with relatively high fees, this whole ""why spend Bitcoin if it will appreciate in value over time"" for arguing why Bitcoin doesn't work as a currency doesn't make any sense. Conversion fees and merchant adoption aside, it literally doesn't matter to me whether I convert half my pay-check to Bitcoin and keep the other half in fiat for spending or if I convert my whole pay-check to Bitcoin and simply use Bitcoin for spending.

If its not an issue why aren't more people spending bitcoin then?

I have only ever seen this hand waived with ""when bitcoin goes mainstream then the price will stabilize and i will start spending it then"", which has a fairly obvious chicken and egg problem built in.

Most bitcoins haven't moved in 6 months. This isn't because the average bitcoin user hasn't bought or sold anything in 6 months, this is because they haven't used bitcoin for buying and selling for 6 months.

They use other currencies for their trade and will continue to do so for as long as its more profitable to hoard bitcoin than to use it for trade.

Warren Buffet is wrong. It's neither investing or gambling. It's speculation. We look at these currencies and make a prediction about the future purchasing power. 

Gambling is when the gambler really doesn't have a way to change the outcome. The game is made in a way to correct for objective analysis through the design of the game or by using odds.

There are no odds in speculation. It's like betting on the favorite at the Kentucky Derby, but you have to decide who the favorite is yourself. Imagine each horse owner tried to convince you that they would win. They hide weaknesses and advertise the strengths of each horse.

Speculation is buying or shorting something because you predict that it will have a higher or lower future value, and you plan to trade it in the future. In the case of bitcoin, we hodl it because we predict that we can trade it for more goods in the future than we can today (higher purchasing power). Same with stock and precious metal speculation.

Of course owning a stock can entitle you to dividends, and that is investment. Many people buy stocks as speculation, investment, or both.

"Hi Ryan. I’m a software engineer of over 25 years (most of those in C++). I can write beautiful code, although plenty of time I write garbage. I can smell my own shit though and this does thus qualify me to pass judgement. Regardless, it is not the code itself that is garbage (I have not even looked at the code), but rather the *design* of segwit given the goals to be achieved. We could talk for a long time about contentious soft forks, the community split, 4mb weighted blocks, tx malleability, scaling etc etc etc. But there is no doubt in my mind that the design taken by core, was disastrous on so many fronts, and for all the wrong reasons. Please don’t think this is just about some lines of code. At very least, consider the man hours still being expended on this whole “war”, consider the wider effect of the split and the censorship etc, consider who the stewards of Bitcoin were, and imagine it all could have been avoided with an extremely simple 4mb hard fork about 2 years ago. That can at least be held in mind before one starts debating the merits of segwit.",1525096382

"Lets take only the use case of sovereign storage of value. From https://data.worldbank.org you can check that the global savings % of GDP stands at around 25%, and the world GDP is 75 trillion.

That is about 18 trillion of US$ globally that needs some sort of deposit. Lets say that for diversification purposes, only 1% should be allocated to crypto and of that only 50% should be in BTC. That would put the crypto liquidity pool at 375 billion to be allocated to Bitcoin alone. At 21 million coins ever to be mined that puts the price of each BTC unit at 17 thousand USD (just around our current ATH... coincidence?)

Now take into account this is just one single use case. There will need to be crypto locked up in transactions, locked up in exchange balances to keep the market going, locked up in payment channels as collateral to physical business contracts. Add that to all the coins that are constantly being lost to forgotten keys. Add all the speculative interest those use cases coming into mainstream would bring.

Take into consideration that we reached 19k without even establishing even 10% of these above use cases. 100k is just 5x from one of the easiest calculations. Personally I think its far easier for BTC to go to 0 for being replaced by something else than to stay at these 1k-10k mid range prices and not reach 100k in the next 5 years.",1525096195

However, in some situations arbitrage is more challenging.  A few months ago, there were reports of coins trading at higher USD on Korean exchanges due to the difficulty of moving dollars out of that country for arbitrage.  A popular price charting site, coinmarketcap if I remember correctly, decided to exclude those exchanges because their prices were not reflected in the rest of the world's exchanges.  This caused some traders to believe the price had declined substantially and some people blamed that for some of the panic selling that came afterwards.

But **so what**: think about most applications for how LN would be used.  For merchant payments, how would the merchant know that a payment has been made if they are not online?  They have to be online anyway to check for payment and then fulfill orders.  For direct user payments, the same is true.

The use case of sending coins to a paper wallet, well, that is not what LN is for.  LN is for **scaling Bitcoin**.  That means that transactions for coffees, merchandise, services, etc. can live on LN, and the Blockhain is still there to secure it all.

"**Antikythera mechanism**

The Antikythera mechanism ( ANT-i-ki-THEER-ə or  ANT-i-KITH-ə-rə) is an ancient Greek analog computer and orrery used to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendar and astrological purposes decades in advance. It could also track the four-year cycle of athletic games which was similar to an Olympiad, the cycle of the ancient Olympic Games.

The artefact was discovered on 17 May 1902 by archaeologist Valerios Stais, among wreckage retrieved from a wreck off the coast of the Greek island Antikythera. The instrument is believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists and has been variously dated to about 87 BC, or between 150 and 100 BC, or to 205 BC, or to within a generation before the shipwreck, which has been dated to approximately 70-60 BC.

The device, housed in the remains of a 340-millimetre (13 in) × 180-millimetre (7.1 in) × 90-millimetre (3.5 in) wooden box, was found as one lump, later separated into three main fragments which are now divided into 82 separate fragments after conservation works.

Failed with a very large backpackers outfit in town. Multi story, several food outlets and bars within their operation.

There's 114B Doge in circulation/supply right now.

In 2019 there'll be 114 + 5.2 = 119.2B (4.5% inflation).

In 2020 there'll be 119.2 + 5.2 = 124.4B (4.3% inflation).

In 2030 there'll be 176.4B (3.04% inflation)

2050: 280.4B (1.89% inflation)

By 2140 when last BTC is mined, Doge's inflation will be 0.70% and total supply 748 billion.

But let's think about the value!

2019: 119B supply = 65.156 BTC market cap, so 1 Đ = 54 satoshi.

2050: 280B supply = assume 70.000 BTC market cap, so 1Đ = 25 satoshi.

2140: 748B supply = assume 75.000 BTC market cap (optimistic), so 1Đ = 10 satoshi.

In roughly 20 years Doge's value would drop to a half.

By 2140 it's value would drop to 1/5th or 20% of it's 2019 value. Not as bad as USD or GBP, but still far worse than BTC or any capped coin.",1525093386

"&gt;Edit: the only factor here is the hassle required for bitcoin-fiat trading. Spending bitcoin is essentially no different to spending fiat provided that you can easily convert (trade) between the two

If the cost of converting is higher than the opportunity cost of not converting then its a waste of money to convert.

Most exchanges charge somewhere between 1-4% fees depending on the order amount and payment method.

Lets say you get paid $1000 at the start of the month. You convert it to $1000 of bitcoin, paying between $10-40 in fees/commission. 

You pay $500 in rent, $300 on food, gas, electricity and other essentials. You need to convert this back to fiat to pay so you pay another 1-4% on that $800, so another $8-32.

$200 you keep in bitcoin for long term savings.

Unless you expect fiat to lose 8% a month, or for bitcoin to gain 8% a month, then you're better off just keeping most of your paycheck in fiat and only converting what you can afford to save.

With the original opcodes many basic things are impossible in practice, like making a decentralized exchange. That's because there's no opcode that pushes outputs on the spending script's stack, so how do you evaluate if the price is right?  
The script is 'turing complete' in a useless way that a turing machine can emulated on it, but that approach is never going to be practical for anything.  

It's of course possible to add more opcodes that allow more things, but then bitcoin cash is going to have the exact same scaling challenges ethereum has. There's no free computational lunch.

&gt;This means that arbitrary calculations can be done on Bitcoin, using a method that separates the DATA and CODE from the proof of execution.

Bitcoin has state too, the utxo set. Assuming sufficiently rich opcodes, this approach leads to a functional-style copying of the state from inputs to the outputs, while changing only few bits. It's much more expensive to execute and transfer, while being functionally equivalent to changing the state directly.",1525091272
"For me, it depends on the market.   Last couple of months, crypto and alt market was really bad that there were some coins that were bleeding for like almost a month straight.  During those times, I considered those coins undervalued.  However, right now, things are looking up, so the duration has shorten.  So right now, I am looking at Binance 2hour chart.   And if you do that, pretty much EVERYTHING is up and up quite a bit.  However, there are few that are not.  For example, Binance 2 hour chart shows that XMR has been bleeding badly relatively to others.  So unless there is a major FUD with XMR, there is no particular reason why it should be bleeding.  

This also means that everyone is jumping into XMR (as you can see from posts here) which is a good sign, imo.  So that's just an example.  ",1525091259

"Hey thanks for the mention /u/theoriginal123123 

You're correct. It's $10 per month, but you get the first month for $1. We don't take any &amp;#37; fees so you keep all your gains. 

I made HodlBot because I'm a big believer in passive indexing. If the history of the stock market tells us anything, most investors are really bad at beating the market.[ Over the last 15\-year period, 95&amp;#37; of active funds failed to beat index funds.](http://www.aei.org/publication/more-evidence-that-its-very-hard-to-beat-the-market-over-time-95-of-financial-professionals-cant-do-it/)

If you believe in crypto as an asset class, then betting on all of it via indexing is not a bad way to invest. It's not hard to execute this strategy by hand. It just takes a ton of manual effort and emotionally discipline, so I made a bot to do the dirty work and because robots have the strongest hands. 

**How the indexing algo works:**

We take the top 20 coins and assign each coin a &amp;#37; allocation based on their weighted market capitalization.

Then we cap every coin to be at most 10&amp;#37; of the total portfolio value. Anything above 10&amp;#37; gets redistributed to all the coins below by weighted market capitalization until the entire sum of the portfolio adds up to 100&amp;#37;.

**Rebalancing period** 

We rebalance very month to keep you at your target &amp;#37;. 


For a long term cryptocurrency strategy, you want to keep your portfolio at a similar risk profile to the original design. If you don’t rebalance, one asset can overwhelm your entire portfolio. 

**Transaction fees**

We simulated the transaction fees for monthly rebalancing over a 3 year period, and found that is cost on average 0.26&amp;#37; annually. This can be higher or lower based on how volatile the market is in the future. The theoretical max is 1.2&amp;#37; \(if every coin in the top 20 turned over every month\).

Craig Wright seems to think it is unnecessary to have non-mining nodes. I already said I'm not sure if I agree with his views. 

Bitmain was instrumental in starting the BCH fork, but they do not ""issue"" BCH. And they do not have control over mining. Their pool, AntPool, has only about 13% hash power on BCH, 11% on BTC.

"Because OP wanted a thorough explanation: COSS stands for Crypto One Stop Solution and aims to be just that. Currently they are focusing on the exchange aspect and they've just added fiat deposits. What's unique about COSS? A few things: first, all COSS token holders that leave their COSS tokens on the exchange or set up the MEW Contract using the instructions on the COSS site automatically receive 50% of all fees collected by the exchange (yes, this includes fiat fees &amp; future merchant point of sale fees). Obviously the fees are split based on how many COSS one holds, but if COSS hits it big (think Kucoin or even better, Bittrex/Binance) the payouts will be substantial. Another unique aspects of the project is their forward thinking in regards to regulatory compliance. COSS seek to be 100% regulatory compliant, which imo will be big in the near future as we see entities such as NASDAQ and NYSE begin to roll out crypto trading. Because COSS is really one of the few exchanges with such a great focus on regulatory compliance, they're setting themselves up for success in the long run. Q2 2018 we should see the release of the public API (will allow for greater liquidity through bot trading) and engine upgrades as the Dev teams new hires start to put in work on COSS's ability to smoothly handle far higher site use/trading volume.",1525089829

"Bch's three claims to the the name Bitcoin are very easy to debunk.

1: ""as described in the whitepaper."" The whitepaper says the fork with the longer chain is Bitcoin. BCH has the shorter chain. It's not bitcoin.

2: ""BCH is the only p2p electronic cash system."" Both BTC and BCH are p2p, both are electronic, both are cash systems. Debunked.

3: ""BCH is closer or truer to Satoshi's original intention."" I genuinely hope Satoshi isn't too troubled by these slanderous assertions. The man intentionally proposed and introduced something that couldn't be adjusted and cooped by a small group of people. Then of course, in true political fashion, a small group starts crying and lying about how it had been taken over by a small group and attempts to take it over. Amazing how similar to Trump tactics the whole thing is. Say someone else is doing something then go do it. Three words: emergency difficulty adjustment. The fact it was ever there is enough to tell you BCH is as Bitcoin as a pterodactyl is an eagle. Sure a pterodactyl is big and can fly. One might even say it's evolution's original vision for birds. But it isn't a bird, can't be, and never will be. Satoshi himself proposed a blocksize limit. Convenient how BCHes keep overlooking that when they claim to be following his intentions. Houses and schools and offices in the USA used to be insulated with asbestos. Should we go back to that because it's the original intention of the building code? Should we demand that only asbestos insulated buildings be called buildings? Should we only ride in horse and buggy because they're the original cars?

The answer is not going to come from inside the system. I think we should just let it collapse in on itself. Bitcoin pulled the rug out from underneath the central banks and so they took over the core dev team and started spewing propaganda against upgrading the network. Now they are trying to take over the payment network with LN. But LN is needlessly complex, poorly thought out, and requires too much effort for users to adopt. If it ever works as described, it will be too little too late in order to save BTC and the central banks will have effectively killed bitcoin except for the fact that BCH exists.

"I think you’ve nailed it in terms of consensus and scarcity driving the price for “store of value” coins. 

For me, it’s all about weighing up the risk of one of those 2 pillars falling against the upside in the case of the consensus becoming more mainstream. 

Assuming that we’re at 1% consensus adoption in the developed world, I’d say there’s still considerable upside to be had. Then there’s the developing countries where fiat inflation is high /volatile and holding BTC represents a significant opportunity. Institutional investor money may also move into the space.

Thomas Lee makes a compelling case for the optimistic option here: 
https://youtu.be/GGberGnxiJk

The million dollar question is what risk weighting do you apportion in the next 2 years to :

1) BTC losing consensus in its value and falling to near zero ( due to crypto bust, or big shift to another more advanced coin)

2) consensus around BTC as “digital gold” spreading and increasing


In my opinion over the next 2-3 years there’s a 70% chance of 1 and 30% chance of 2. 

As the upside potential is way higher than the downside (some think it could 100x), I decided to invest - but no more than I’d be comfortable losing.

I’ve also set the price I’m targeting to sell half my stack at, because there’s always a chance the consensus on BTC could break and it drops like a stone. 

TL;DR - upside higher than downside, therefore I’m invested. However, high chance of total wipeout, therefore don’t invest more than you can afford to lose

"**Hate speech**

Hate speech is speech that attacks a person or group on the basis of attributes such as race, religion, ethnic origin, national origin, sexual orientation, disability, or gender. The law of some countries describes hate speech as speech, gesture or conduct, writing, or display that incites violence or prejudicial action against a protected group or individual on the basis of their membership of the group, or because it disparages or intimidates a protected group, or individual on the basis of their membership of the group. The law may identify a protected group by certain characteristics. In some countries, hate speech is not a legal term.

Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) is an anonymous key agreement protocol that allows two parties, each having an elliptic-curve public–private key pair, to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel. This shared secret may be directly used as a key, or to derive another key. The key, or the derived key, can then be used to encrypt subsequent communications using a symmetric-key cipher. It is a variant of the Diffie–Hellman protocol using elliptic-curve cryptography.

Shouldn’t require much additional overhead. I think it’s a great idea that all messages on chain should be encrypted. Allowing “bad” messages to be publicly visible forever is detrimental to Bitcoin Cash. Should in theory be possible to have group messages encrypted too.1,1525083524
"The argument for green is used as the most common cash in the world doesn't really come together.

The reason why orange was chosen is because it stays in ones mind and can be easily spotted from across the street.  The same can not be said for green.

"If i follow the analogy, then the Tesla is way more away from the original idea, i was just pointing out that.

I definitely don't want to start again the endless debate, but do you understand that simply increasing the block size is nothing else than linear scaling? Actually it is not even scaling, just pushing the problem away? If BTC network can handle - lets say - 4 TX/s, then BCH with increasing the size to the factor of 32 then it will be able to handle 4x32TX, so 128 TX/s, which is still not enough for large scale adoption, but if all those blocks are full, it will result in 192MB blockchain increase in each hour, 4.6GB increase every day, 1.68TB every year. Running a node with a few mbit/s connection never will be able to sync, and the point of running a node is everyone anywhere can run it, and even a poor area where the connection is slow can still watch - lets say - a youtube video without having problem with the synchronization and block validation.

If we follow the analogy, this is not more than the Ford Model T with a bigger, stronger engine that may be more powerful, but uses more fuel to achieve that power. A way more efficient car, that has a small turbo/supercharged engine without being big and using half the fuel for the same power is exponential scaling. And then if you remove the combustion engine and replace it with electronic motors and batteries, to make it even more efficient then it is not a car anymore?",1525083494

This sub is fucking full of greed and Sunday traders. We should appreciate the technology behind this revolution, not the daily gains, the bulls, the bears and all this shit.

"&gt;Let people use fiat if they want.

Unfortunately there’s not much about the fiat system that can be considered voluntary. Borrowing from an old comment of mine:

*What* gives fiat *value* is the wrong question. Value is subjective. *People* assign (differing and subjective) values to fiat based on their perceptions and preferences. A better question is what gives fiat its *price* -- in terms of the quantity of goods / services that a person must spend in order to ""buy"" a given quantity. Price is determined by the intersection of supply and demand. In order to have a ""supply"" in an economic sense, a good needs to be scarce. Where does fiat's (relative) scarcity come from? Well, that does in fact come from men with guns granting a violence-backed monopoly on fiat's issuance to a privileged elite. What about the demand side? Well, government violence plays a role there as well. Taxes collected via threat of violence are payable exclusively in fiat. Legal tender laws (enforced via violence) are another way that fiat is given a privileged position in the market for money. And would-be money competitors are also disadvantaged by things like taxation on capital gains when trading, e.g. appreciated precious metals (even if that ""appreciation"" is only an artifact of fiat's depreciation). As I say, Bitcoin uses a blockchain protected by proof of work. Fiat uses debt chains protected by proof of violence.",1525083249
"WanChain is such a solid bet, I got that as my ""ETH/BTC"" and it works way better then BTC/ETH. This coin will grow over time as it's . great project, small supply, and it's also only listed on 2 exchanges yet..",1525082984

"&gt; Who will provide you with a mortgage for your house?

A crowdfunded mortgage platform built on blockchain?  Anyone with any spare cash can deposit into a smart contract pool and get returns. Anyone that needs a mortgage will have their credit score and history in blockchain form and will be automatically granted a certain loan size based on that history. Insurance for defaulters will be baked into the costs of the platform, and because your credit history is on the blockchain you will be punished forever for trying to cheat the system. This is exactly the sort of thing that blockchain/crypto opens up.  P2P lending that replaces central banks.  It's not going to happen in the next year or two but this is why decentralisation fanatics are so, well, fanatical.",1525082799
"Read this blog post by the inventor of bittorrent, it summarizes everything there is to know about unconfirmed transactions: https://medium.com/@bramcohen/the-inevitable-demise-of-unconfirmed-bitcoin-transactions-8b5f66a44a35",1525082710

banking system will replace crypto,1525082643
"&gt; If I trade coins on an exchange and cash out in BTC, there would be no way for me to control the coin I receive or where it has been spent previously

Exactly, you have no control over what bitcoins you get from an exchange. The fact is that if your bitcoin was found to have passed through some darknet market before it was in your possession, YOU can later be charged with money laundering. See for example this case: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1568048.0
Thus, a bitcoin is not always the same as another bitcoin.

&gt; The same for any cash I withdraw from a bank.

After you withdraw it, cash is private and anonymous. A dollar is a dollar, for the most part, because it doesn't say anything about its past. Dollar notes do have serial numbers, but I agree in practice these are rarely used for tracking.

An oz of gold is an oz of gold, because you can melt it down and remove any identifying property a gold coin might have, but still retain the same value.

As far as I know, fungibility can only be enforced by mandatory privacy, or maybe by the burning and minting of coins, but if people can burn and mint coins that makes it difficult to keep track of the total supply which is rather important. Andreas Antonopoulos has a few interesting talks about fungibility and privacy on his channel, if you like more info: https://www.youtube.com/user/aantonop/videos",1525082473
Well bitcoin and B.Cash are two of the most technically sophisticated scams of all time along with 99% if all other crypto. ,1525082460
"The definition of cryptocurrency doesn't necessarily require a blockchain.  

If transactions are signed using public/private key cryptography, it is a cryptocurrency.   

Bitcoin wasn't the first cryptocurrency; it was the first cryptocurrency to use a permissionless, distrusted data structure (blockchain) to record transactions.  But cryptocurrency existed prior to Bitcoin.

Of course I certainly wouldn't invest in the Petro, since it is a fiat currency which could be inflated at any time.   But it can still serve a useful function as currency for the Venezulan regime by bypassing the finacial blocade.

Where ripple excels with its product development team to produce ready-to-use solutions for front end customers, stellar makes up for with its incentivized partnership/anchor model, to enable them to develop front end solutions.

"Apologies if you receive another similar reply - I had typed one on mobile, but it seems to not have sent.

TL;DR: It's complicated.

BTC (which is the ticker for the Cryptocurrency Bitcoin) was developed from the Bitcoin sourcecode. Today BTC is developed by a few groups of developers, and original developers such as Satoshi (original creator of BTC and Bitcoin sourcecode) are no longer involved with development. These developers have made various changes to the Bitcoin sourcecode (which in itself is not negative), and BTC now does not adhere to some of the original Bitcoin ""whitepaper"" - a document made by Satoshi that detailed what he wanted Bitcoin to be.

A group of people disliked the changes to BTC, and so forked the sourcecode of Bitcoin to make BCH (ticker for 'Bitcoin Cash'). BCH is meant to closer resemble the original goals of BTC, however is still different (e.g. it has larger block sizes) so cannot claim to be identical to the original Bitcoin/BTC.

There are 3/4 different ways of viewing the debate of which is the 'real' Bitcoin.

The most dominant group on r/Bitcoin (minority here) view BCH as having no resemblance to BTC. They often call BCH ""bcash"" or ""btrash"", in order to eliminate the ""Bitcoin"" part of BCH. They feel that BTC is and will always be the 'real' Bitcoin, as it was the original implementation of the Bitcoin sourcecode. To take a real-world example, the software LibreOffice forked from OpenOffice. OpenOffice users do not view LibreOffice users as users of OpenOffice, and Libreoffice users do not think they are using OpenOffice.

The group I fit most with are what I'd call moderates. They're most common on r/btc, but exist on r/Bitcoin too. They accept that BCH is a fork of the Bitcoin sourcecode. Drawing other real-life comparisons, take a look at Linux. The mainstream kernel, simply linux (LNX here to reduce confusion) has a fork called linux-lts (LTS) which is used for Long-Term Support. LTS users will often say they use Linux in casual conversation, however this can cause confusion between LNX and LTS feature-wise. So LTS users will also typically specify they use the LTS fork of Linux. Further, LTS users do not think that LNX is not Linux - they view both LTS and LNX as Linux kernels. Put simply, this group of people view BTC and BCH as forms of Bitcoin, but that BTC is the original implementation and that to reduce confusion only BTC should be referred to as simply Bitcoin: BCH is Bitcoin Cash, not Bitcoin. In this way, BTC is the 'real' cryptocurrency called Bitcoin, but both BTC and BCH are 'real' implementations of the Bitcoin sourcecode.

Then you have a quite notorious group on r/BTC. They see BCH as the 'real' Bitcoin, and BTC as a corrupted, corporate form of Bitcoin. Like the first group, they're not above namecalling and often refer to BTC as ""Bitcoin Core"" or ""bcore"", after the main development team for Bitcoin. To use the above Linux example, it would be similar to the LTS fork of Linux renouncing calling LNX Linux, and declaring only LTS is Linux. This is sadly the view of some of the more vocal BCH supporters/developers, such as Roger Ver.

Finally, a few people do not seem to have the 'real' Bitcoin as a definition set in stone. They claim to support the most popular Bitcoin-related crypto as the 'real' Bitcoin, currently BTC. Supposedly, if BCH became more popular, they would refer to BCH as the 'real' Bitcoin.

Really, it's up to you to decide what group you fit in with most. The 'real Bitcoin' debate is (although also technical) more emotional than anything else. In addition, there are financial motives for both sides to claim to be the 'real' Bitcoin. As ""Bitcoin"" (known only as that, not BTC) is what the majority of the public outside the crypto-space know as the most popular (or only) cryptocurrency, ""Bitcoin"" is what most new buyers will invest in/buy. If ""Bitcoin"" points to BCH in the future, BTC will likely become less popular and so BTC holders/investors will lose money. BCH holders stand to gain money from increased interest by being called the 'real' Bitcoin by this same logic.

This doesn't really detail Bitcoin Gold, or other lesser-known Bitcoin forks. However, you can mostly substitute BCH for Bitcoin Gold (BTG, I think) in this post to get the same idea. 

r/btc is for any types/forks of Bitcoin, so that encompasses BTC, BCH, BTG. hey try to be as open as possible to discussion, censoring users as little as possible. r/Bitcoin, however, only allows discussion about the cryptocurrency Bitcoin (e.g. BTC). They do however allow for the criticism or mocking of Bitcoin forks, e.g. the whole ""btrash"" thing. In addition, r/Bitcoin discourages discussion or criticism of BTC outside the mainstream, and even emply(ed?) custom CSS rules to make it appear they weren't censoring users on a wide scale in the past.",1525078105

If they would not, they would not mine it.

If the miners would expect a sudden death for BTC; they would take a huge risk to keep mining it, because they would not be able to sell, once the onslaught begins. the network would get congested so fast that you wouldnt make it to the exchanges in time.

Segwit was a way to fix transaction malleability (along with some other things), which was needed for the Lightning Network. However, there are many proposals to fix transaction malleability. The reason segwit was chosen was not because it was superior, but because it did not require a hardfork. This was one of the main selling points of segwit; that it did not require a hardfork. But the cost of segwit is that it is very, very complex- many would even say ""messy"". A much cleaner way would have simply been to hardfork. Regarding Lightning, it could and would work just as well, probably better, on BCH, if it were ever to be completed.

"The nodes run clients. The so called ""full nodes"" that don't actually hash should never be used for voting purposes, but that has been implied in many situations.

The mining nodes described in the design are better inventivized and can't be faked. Short of using human IDs to allow only highly skilled and honest technocrats to vote in a controlled setting, them choosing the most profitable route through their consensus is the best way at arriving at network decisions and upgrades. 

And yes, they take the community and their opinions into account (as we have seen), because they rely on it to make money, but the community still can't fork off from them without introducing significant risks. The system was not made for that scenario.

The differences are subtle, but in a debate where social media wide censorship, manipulation and smear tactics have been employed, little differences make big ones.

If Bitcoin Cash has less hash rate, opponents pick on that. If it has more, they move on to accumulated PoW. If it has that, they bring up node count (which you know better about). If there enough nodes however, they suddenly realize that these can be sock puppets and suggest that the ""community""must decide. With other options exhausted, they look to large Twitter followings and then to meetups and then to companies with lots of companies and then to more reputable companies (eventually just their companies) and then to media bias and then supposedly to government reports. (Such as the butchered one that of course to the contrary correctly concluded that Bitcoin Cash was Bitcoin, but on phony grounds). -I'm speaking now of the inconsistent debaters, nor necessarily yourself.

You probably get my point.

Number of clients? Bitcoin is peer-to-peer, and not client-server. There are not any clients in Bitcoin.

Also, if you mean “nodes” then also, the number of them is irrelevant. The value of a coin is in the rules that a group of nodes enforce. A group of nodes wishing to transact which one another will enforce the same set of rules and as a consequence, all stay on the same blockchain. It doesn’t matter whether it’s 10 or 10,000 nodes.

If miners unilaterally change the rules, then each node can either reject or accept the new rules. The group of nodes that reject the new rules will reject blocks until a block comes that obeys the original set of rules that they enforce. The group of nodes that accept the new rules will accept the blocks with the new set of rules and they will be on an alternate blockchain that has its own token with its own value.
