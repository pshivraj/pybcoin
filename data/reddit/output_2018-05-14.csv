Interesting how you just single out Taleb and don't address the idea of skin in the game. Perhaps if you will not answer the ASIC question, you will answer this one: all other things being equal, who would you rather trust to make good investment decisions on yoru behalf, someone with a NW of 100MM USD or someone with a net worth of 0.02 BTC?",1526367591

"Bitcoin is not gold

Bitcoin can't teleport

Why not just describe it as it really is?

A bitcoin is a number in a distributed ledger, one of 10s of thousands of similar distributed ledgers. The supply of virtual tokens is controlled by a small cabal of developers and the people who started the scheme gave themselves a lot of the coins first.

The numbers in the ledger represent nothing and are not a currency. People buy them with the hope to sell them to someone else for more money in the future.

Groups of ""miners"" print up new coins each day and to buy the coins, you go to an ""exchange"" which you pay both on the buy and sell side to make transactions.

Vechain i invested in due to my own research before I met the beautiful /r/CryptoCurrency because I liked the professionalism, partnerships, development team, and the fact that it has room to grow (I invested when it wasn't a top 20 coin). I think it's got a good use case and room to grow, so I'll roll with it for now (maybe down the line ill slowly remove my position for some other coins, we will have to play it by ear).

WAX, XZC, RDD, GNT etc. make up &lt; 15% of my portfolio so I am not worried. All generally low market cap compared to my other investments so if one pops off, I'll be happy. 

XLM and XRP, although are more centralized, have the most real use cases and can continue to gain adoption where it matters, the banking systems. Crypto in my opinion will co-exist with the banking systems so this is gonna be a really good bet imo.

To me, there's really 2 scenarios for Crypto long term. Since ERC20 and ICOs are somewhat new, in the respect that we never had such a low BTC dominance before, I think it's safe to say market dynamics changed, ever since last summer 2017. 


These ICOs have nothing to do with Cryptocurrency success. They haven't been around for nine years to work. They're new and most of them suck, most of them don't have a functional product yet, but are valued billions.

"Bitcoin is not inflation proof. 

Monetary policy employed by national banks is designed to control inflation and keep it at a fixed rate. They do this by controlling the interest rate. 

That way, if your dollar gets strong for other reasons they can increase lending, which causes inflation, and keeps the dollar value low, all the while stimulating the economy with lending. 

Conversely, if the economy is slow, and the dollar is weak, they increase the interest rate, which reduces lending, and so the currency doesn't get devalued as much from making new money. It only does on higher interest loans, which are tougher to get, and therefore more likely to succeed and help the economy. More sure things and less risks.

These are good things.

Bitcoin doesn't have any of that, but it can still have crazy inflation. 

When the value of Bitcoin goes up and down, that's inflation and deflation. A lot of people buy Bitcoin just for the sole reason they are hoping for deflation, for the value to increase.

"&gt;This is exactly the same thing for the BCH DAA.

Yes, it is. What is different is that BCH has changed the DAA twice during the life of its chain. Although the difficulty target is still linked to the entirety of the chain, validating it involves the extra complication of accounting for the changes.

&gt; I agreed that BCH inflation schedule was disrupted, do you agree that BTC inflation schedule is too fast?

I suppose by your definition of ""too fast"" it may be so. 

In my opinion the absolute time is far less important than the per-block inflation rate. So long as the difficulty adjustment rate is sufficient to compenstate for improvement in hardware and interest in mining, while still supporting the goal of enduring the honest chain outgrows any competing chain, the actual time over which the fixed inflation occurs is rather arbitrary.

&gt;Can you explain how?
&gt;
&gt;For both chain equality, if attack BCH will raise much faster.

When under a 51%+ attack a chain's difficulty will not necessarily increase. The attacker only needs to out work the honest miners by a slim margin, and they are free to manipulate the timing data in their blocks to minimize their impact on difficulty. It is in the attacker's interest to do so, since if they cause the difficulty to increase, it would take them that much more work per-block.

BCH's fast-adjustment DAA would result in a rapid drop in difficulty, making it less expensive per-block to censor the honest miners. Once the DAA has adjusted to match the remaining hash rate of the remaining honest miners, the attacker can just barely out work this new difficulty.

BTC would not adjust as quickly. The attacker must continue to expend the high amount of effort required to meet the high difficulty for each block they seek censor. When the difficulty does adjust down, it may not be able to adjust down sufficiently to match the hash rate of the honest minority, despite the attacker's attempts to minimize their impact. They would then need to spend another adjustment period expending a higher work effort per block. And so on.

&gt;And I doubt BTC will have much value if it only get a block every two hours for an extended period of time.

And I'd be ok with that. If 80% of the hash power became hostile - or even disappeared with the high risk of becoming hostile - confidence in the chain's future reliability would be severely undermined.",1526364499

"**Manufacturing Consent**

Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media is a 1988 book written by Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky, in which the authors propose that the mass communication media of the U.S. ""are effective and powerful ideological institutions that carry out a system-supportive propaganda function, by reliance on market forces, internalized assumptions, and self-censorship, and without overt coercion"", by means of the propaganda model of communication. The title derives from the phrase ""the manufacture of consent,"" employed in the book Public Opinion (1922), by Walter Lippmann (1889–1974).

Chomsky credits the origin of the book to the impetus of Alex Carey, the Australian social psychologist, to whom he and co-author E. S. Herman dedicated the book. Four years after publication, Manufacturing Consent: The political Economy of the Mass Media was adapted to the cinema as Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media (1992), a documentary presentation of the propaganda-model of communication, the politics of the mass-communications business, and a biography of Chomsky.

"As some BCH wallets start to hide away the legacy format and thus only support CashAddr it doesn't make sense from a business perspective to not support CashAddr too. Asking the customer to use external services to translate from their CashAddr to the legacy format does not improve the customer's experience with the platform. Even if ShapeShift doesn't like CashAddr it is time to start supporting it.

Btw I don't think many people are aware but legacy Bitcoin (BTC) also have an address format that is like CashAddr, it's called ""Bech32"" and these addresses typically starts with ""bc1"": https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32

Not many BTC services actually use it though, here's an example:

https://explorer.bitcoin.com/btc/tx/514a33f1d46179b89e1fea7bbb07b682ab14083a276979f91038369d1a8d689b

Notice how it says ""Unparsed address"" three times? This is a valid transaction but not even bitcoin.com's block explorer understands the bc1 address format.

Luckily the Bitcoin Cash community are much more accepting of change and CashAddr has gained a lot of support. This kind of address really is a lot better than the legacy address, sure it's a little longer but you can read it to someone without constantly needing to say upper/lower case and CashAddr uses a 5 bytes checksum instead of the old 4 bytes so there's improved protection against mistyped addresses. CashAddr also have a version baked into it, so it can be extended upon later if needed.

Personally I think CashAddr just looks better too, the numbers usually tower above all the letters. When they stick out like that it kind of separates the address into several pieces, which also improves readability (easier to find your place when you take your eyes off the address).

The characters b i o 1 will never appear in a CashAddr btw. I think it's strange that they skipped ""B"" instead of ""L"" though, I wonder what the reason was? I suppose it makes for thinner addresses in certain fonts but on the other hand if you get an address with four L next to each other it makes it a little harder to read.",1526363674

Threre are better alternatives to BCH if you complaining with fees. The best one is LTC, which was created in 2011 exactly for everyday spending and microtransactions. It has 10x lower fees compared to BCH. 

Litecoin: 0.226 kb * 0.00001 LTC/kb * $140 = $0.0003668 in fees

Bitcoin Cash: 226 bytes * 1 sat/byte / 100,000,000 (divide by this to convert satoshis to BCH) * $1460 = $0.0033 in fees

"&gt;&amp;gt;No, the Bitcoin DAA only consider the past 2000 blocks window for its calculation and the precedente 2000 blocks to check the difficulty didn’t drop below some threshold.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;And that it, there could be no block or a million before those 4000 ones, it would make not difference for the DAA.

&gt;An adjustment requires an initial value from which to adjust. In the case of DAA, the validity of that starting value is dependent on the state prior to its adjustment. This chain of dependency goes all the way back to the genesis. The entirety of the blockchain determines the present difficulty target and therefore influences the DAA.

&gt;One one only needs to observe the latest block header to mine a new block, but its validity is dependent on the complete history of the chain. So to can the difficulty adjustment be calculated using only the present difficulty and the absolute duration of the last difficulty period, and its validity is no less dependent on the complete chain.

This is **exactly** the same thing for the BCH DAA.

It just used a 100 block window and recalculate per block.

So if you claim is exact for BTC, it is also for BCH.

There is no fundamentals difference in that regard.

&gt;&amp;gt;I don’t overlook it.

&gt;The genesis of this comment chain was my assertion that it is intellectually dishonest to exclude mention of the changes BCH has made to the difficulty schedule. If this does not apply to you, fantastic! I am more than willing to entertain any reasonable argument for why or how any property of bitcoin can, should or must be modified, or why such properties should remain immutable. What I cannot abide is an attempt to conceal those changes when they have occurred.

It came from a mistake and was corrected to a much better algo than BTC.

If a disruption in the inflation happened on BCH and shouldn’t be ignored: absolutely, it wasn’t volontary and wasn’t maint to change the currency (like the 1MB limit in bitcoin core)

If you agree that this disruption of the inflation schedule has been made on BCH then you should agree that the current disruption of inflation happening on BTC should be mentioned too. (1500 block by 6 months too fast).

Over the long term (in the next few years even) the BTC DAA will have much more impact what happened on BCH.

I agreed that BCH inflation schedule was disrupted, do you agree that BTC inflation schedule is too fast?

It goes both way, 

&gt;&amp;gt;Like chinese banning bitcoin mining and difficulty drop permanently 80%?
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;That would mean at least three to four month to recover while BCH will have recovered in few days.

&gt;If 80% of the work capacity were to suddenly drop, that would indicate an incredibly high probability that such capacity is available to attack the chain. BTC would adjust slowly and, while still vulnerable to the absent majority, would remain expensive to attack for a longer period. **BCH would adjust more rapidly and thus be _more vulnerable_ to manipulation (censorship, double-spending) by the hostile capacity.**

Can you explain how?

&gt;The rapid difficulty reduction would act as a multiplier for the attacker's work capacity.

For both chain equality, if attack BCH will raise much faster.

Actually whoever got that much hash rate will most like go toward BCH because waiting the 100 block to get you rewards will be so extremely long on BTC that it will be pointless.

Additionally nobody was forced to accept these banknotes, as prior to the creation of the central banking system, banks were just regular private businesses.

It is not inerrantly superior it is simply a return to the fundamentals of a project we support for years.

Very few alternatives bring anything to the table.

I think (IMO) only monero and ETH bring something valuable.

So far only BCH aim to scale onchain significantly (just like bitcoin aimed to) so it is superior in that regard for me.

Other project claim to be superior with higly experimental (and more or less trusted) set up.

Like IOTA.. (Actually the bitcoin UTXO is already a tangle.. IOTA bring nothing new, just less security because of no blockchain)

"I think you're greatly misunderstanding the final level of UX abstraction that users will interact with, once wallets and clients are rolled out under general release candidates. 

The user need not be concerned with the inner workings of opening/closing channels or anything else that goes on behind the scenes. In fact, it's not even necessary they know they're using LN, this process could integrate seamlessly with an existing BTC wallet.

It's also not necessary to run your own node. You can use a third party hosting service (again, all automatic) or just use watchtowers when your node is offline. The important part is that LN provides users with scalability, liquidity and fungibility while also being fully backed by blockchain PoW and giving you the ability to keep control over your keys.

Again, these payments are instant and basically feeless, which is a far cry from the slow wait for confirmations on the blockchain for either project. Not sure why you're so bearish or skeptical that it'll work.

\&gt; I’ve never understood the BTC/BCH blocksize controversy. Hasn’t this been solved? 

It's far from it mate, do pay r/btc a visit and ask in detail if you really want to know, all viewpoints welcome. 

Currently we're going through like the 5th time btc hasn't been able to scale in high usage with people having to pay over $50 in fees to get a broadcast in 15 hours at peak times, and the first time was about 2014ish, which is when the debate really started. If you have time you can read this to understand it: 

[https://medium.com/@jcliff/understanding\-the\-block\-size\-debate\-351bdbaaa38](https://medium.com/@jcliff/understanding-the-block-size-debate-351bdbaaa38) 

I think the blocksize debate has really hurt adoption by years. I hope more people read up on it and take a side, whichever side they choose based on full research. BTC was truly in adoption on its way to full scale acceptance if anyone was here in 2013ish. Block size increase was never supposed to be an issue, non mining nodes were never supposed to be stakeholders as, and off chain scaling was never so non nonchalantly cool. 

Not sure what you think about it but second layer solution btc is simply not btc. That invalidates the whole point of a publicly vetted digital smart ledger. Plus second layer centralized operations in the hands of data centers who are the only ones who could keep those high density channels open, even with the Core complaint that bch centralizes it in the hands of capable systems even though hardware has got cheaper with time throughout history, is still way more centralized. And BCH chain is supposed to reach 1.2 terrabytes with full blocks in ten years. I simply do not understand how a user won't be able to run a node, as hard drives and internet connections will get cheaper, probably faster, too. This is a such a bogeyman debate to hide what's really happening, which is prepping btc for big institutional usage. Too bad it doesn't work, fees are high and network clogged again.

"&gt; ""You people""? Everyone involved with crypto wants it to succeed in general. 

I strongly disagree. There are a lot of opportunists and malicious people infesting this space. 

&gt;This upgrade is a big step for BCH to start carving out it's own niche. 

Is it though? It's a cap increase with OP codes turned back on. I fail to see the significance. The blocks are currently under 100 Kb, so what is the point of a 32 Mb limit? There's no demand. Increasing the limit does not magically create demand. BCH is processing less than BTC was in 2013.

&gt;Hopefully as BTC and BCH continue to diverge this community infighting will become less relevant, to the benefit of everyone.

It's not infighting, it's simply stating that there won't be two winners here. Sound/Hard money is best fulfilled by one unified network, as per Metcalfe's law and best liquidity. There are not going to be two competing coins for this fundamental use case (is it even a competition now?). One will remain decentralized, immutable, censorship-resistant and consensus-based and the other will naturally become centralized due to the roadmap naturally pushing out small nodes and miners.

To think that one project is not going to prevail over the other (either project), is rather naive. It simply won't play out that way. We're in a period right now of insane valuations for endless alts and ICOs. It won't last long. It's simply a hype wave that has led to trading hysteria and numerous pump and dump schemes. Whether or not Bitcoin Cash falls into that camp is kind of hard to say but it's clear that it's frontrun by complete scammers. The fact that people on this sub pay respect to the likes of Roger and CSW just goes to show you where peoples' heads are at. This project is not about crypto revolution, it's about multiplying peoples' capital.

If you see it differently, fair enough, but it's absurd to think that there will be multiple top-tier hard money crypto projects. I cannot imagine a scenario where that would play out.

"Come on. I was not around for the scaling debate and even I know better. /r/Bitcoin is for discussion about Bitcoin. The questions you are asking are found through an awesome function called ‘Search’. I know, right? Crazy.

The reasons why people are intolerant of the discussion is because it’s old, stale, redundant, and over. It took a lot of trolls and repeated questions and arguments to get this way - all the info is available. Want it? Find it - or ask people where to find it if you don’t know. People are tired of this conversation.

None of what I said is difficult to understand or learn on your own. What you are doing is attention seeking. If you weren’t, we wouldn’t be having this conversation.

Your motives are very disingenuous.

bitcoin.com: run by people with a certain belief about what they see as the best way to scale Bitcoin, and so the information they put out is skewed to one perspective.

World Crypto Network: a Youtube channel whose regular speakers typically have a certain view about what they see as the best way to scale Bitcoin, and so the arguments they present is often skewed to one perspective.

Twitter: a medium where all views can be aired, but one in which some people choose to mute other people that don't conform to what they want to hear, thus reinforcing the so called echo chamber.

Mainstream Media: who has their own biases for their own reasons - which are typically at odds with all camps from within the crypto community.

Point is, getting truly impartial information about a given issue is hard. You are not going to find it in a single place. If you really want to do some research that will enable you to form a sound opinion on a topic then there is no getting around the fact that you need to interact with multiple communities with an open mind.

I'm beginning to think these cancellation mishaps are not mishaps.

The wallet I used to shop at Overstock.com was a newly created wallet loaded with funds acquired by paying cash to an anonymous seller through LocalBitcoin. So, that wallet and those funds were in no way shedding any light on who I was.

Maybe, as part of Coinbase's terms of supporting merchants, they deliberately seek out such wallets passing through to enforce AML laws. Maybe their relationship with the IRS is more intertwined than people already think. 

Try it yourself. Use a wallet that has no history connecting you to it and see if Coinbase's algorithms flag your purchase as cancelled simply to force you to come forward and verify your identity while they hold your crypto as ransom. ",1526357961

 As for the post, yes, many societies are working toward cashlessness as a way to (attempt) to gain more insight, oversight and control of peoples finances. They would all love us to use plastic over cash. This is nothing new though. I know a guy who still has a stack of $1000 USD bills. For a long time after they stopped being legal tender they were still used and traded between cartels and the major gangs and mafia. I don't think they are used much anymore by criminals but when they were 'circulating' out of circulation the criminals couldn't ever even dream of trading them for clean cash or assets outside laundering it. Why did they use those bills if they couldn't trade them legitimately? Aside from being easy to carry, they were worth just as much to those closed societies as when they were legal tender.  

 The governments and central banks are just afraid they are being closed out of general society. If they control the only access points and have eyes literally everywhere they can't be shut out. It's no lie when they say they are clamping down on money laundering and corruption though. Their ability to monitor our every move is just a convenient side effect.

"Good for you in actually taking profits. XRP holders do talk about that but not as much as you think. I doubt you’re active on any xrp forums outside of Reddit who care more about each step the company actually takes.

Jesus fucking Christ. You’ve literally done little to no research. XRP needs increase liquidity. The crypto buyers help with increased liquidity and can also profit off of it.

Many banks and remittance companies are using XCurrent and are piloting XRapid. XRapid can help save institutions 40-50% of associated costs but still can’t send money across borders within seconds. 

XRP with XRapid makes that possible which was just proven recently by sending money from NYC to Mexico.

XRP gets burned with each use which will slowly increase the scarcity and drive up the price. 

XRP will soon be able to be send money within 1 second or less when Cobalt is fully implemented.

Also, XRP is bringing back Codius which will allow dapps to be made on the XRP blockchain.

You’re mocking a crypto company running like a legitimate business even though they’re working to strengthen Ripple and XRP’s name to institutions with bigger wallet. Hard work pays off and will eventually bring steady, organic profits instead of pumps and dumps. Also, don’t you think the banks would like the price of XRP to increase after they’ve invested in it? The answer is obvious.

If you’ve ever invested in the stock market (which a majority of my overall portfolio consists of) then you would understand running a company like Ripple does will eventually give you profits with less risk.

It's more or less up to you to protect your identity or the fact that you own bitcoin, just like cash. But I would much rather have a brainwallet / seed that nobody knows about than money in a state run or private bank if I were in a shithole like Libya. It's certainly safer than carrying money or gold in such a place. Even having significant amounts of gold or money in Libya would be dangerous as a private citizen.",1526352356

"&gt;Centralization will always be equal between BCH and BTC because the same exact machines will always be mining both chains.

This is so misinformed. It's a common misconception that miners have all the power in Bitcoin. They don't. Otherwise, they'd be able to do silly things for their own benefit like increase the mining reward. Satoshi was much smarter than that:

&gt;A lot of people seem to have the impression that you can do anything you want if you have 51&amp;#37; of the hashrate. 51&amp;#37; attacks are a lot less powerful than I think most people realize, and it’s one of the greatest strengths of Bitcoin. Miners are beholden to the consensus rules. If miners create an illegal block, it doesn’t matter how much hashrate they have or how much they extend the illegal chain — full nodes will just ignore them. This means that miners are unable to change consensus rules like the coin inflation or block size. Miners are unable to steal money that was never sent to them, and they can’t force full nodes off of the network.  
&gt;  
&gt;This fact, combined with all the other incentives that more or less force Bitcoin miners to keep the market \+ price happy, means that Bitcoin enjoys a huge amount of security even in the face of the miner centralization that plagues it today. It is of course a far better situation if there is nobody who controls even 1&amp;#37; of the hashrate, but the situation today is not a dystopia. The miners have relatively little power, despite their hashrate centralization. [Source](https://blog.sia.tech/choosing-asics-for-sia-b318505b5b51)

Here's some things that are *more* important than mining power for decentralization:

* Diversity in wallet software
* No central leadership \(i.e. no Buterin\). One of the greatest hidden strengths of Bitcoin was actually that nobody could come to a consensus on scaling... so nothing happened.
* Number of independent, non\-mining full nodes

Bitcoin trounces the competition on all counts, currently. Raising the blocksize hurts point number 3 \- the bigger the blockchain, the more bandwidth and computing power you need to run a node, and the less there will be. That's why NEO has such stupid TPS numbers \- because they only have seven nodes \(and the company controls them all\).

Also, with segwit, the block weight regularly goes above 2MB. Segwit *was* a blocksize increase.",1526351471

"IMO, short-term and likely mid-term+ bigger blocks was the ONLY way to go (until/if anything else is PROVEN to work) to keep:

* Fees near zero
* Every transaction getting into the NEXT block
* Adoption steam rolling ahead

Core, by refusing to increase block size to even just a mere 2-MB has crippled BTC with:

* High fees-&gt;to even higher fees... it just varies...
* Variable tx times-minutes to hours+... it just varies
* Ditched instant tx (0-conf.) due to RBF
* NEGATIVE adoption due to reasons above...
* Censorship of anyone on various forums that had questions/ideas to solve these problems that did not conform to core's mantra (NOT fixing the problem, even though YEARS have gone by since scaling became a concern)",1526351274

"One of the things that I think is very damaging and distracting for all parties involved is the constant attempts to claim that the arguments are all one side vs the other. The whole thing has turned into a constant left vs right, democrats vs republicans - partisan issue.

I see many people here constantly equating the moderation style and policy of /r/bitcoin to censorship by the ""Core camp"", which only servers to further this us vs them nonsense.

r/bitcoin is a forum on reddit. No more, no less. As with the vast majority of forums it has a moderation policy. r/btc also has it's own set of trolls who will upvote and downvote your posts in order to effectively 'censor' or 'manipulate' the discussion.

Wether you agree with the moderation policy or community behaviour of one or another of these reddit forums or not - you have many options of places where you can discuss your ideas. Twitter, Slack developer communities, IRC rooms, or developer mailing lists generally tend to be far more open and inclusive, with more well informed discussion taking place and I would generally favour these mediums over any of these once popular reddit cess pools.

When you constantly point the finger and say ""my post was deleted from r/bitcoin, so therefore all developers that work on the Bitcoin Core implementation or follow the Bitcoin consensus rules are engaging in censorship,  are being controlled by Blockstream Core, and are owned by AXA and Bilderberg Group"" is completely nonsensical, disrespectful to the hundreds of developers that work on the Bitcoin Core protocol implementation, and alienating for the vast majority of open minded people that don't subscribe to these sorts of conspiracy theories.

So your post got removed from a forum because the moderators of that forum decided it wasn't inline with their policies. Get over it. The Internet is a big place. You have plenty of ways to make your voice heard. Don't let this make you become one of these partisan closed minded people that you claim to hate so much.",1526350947

"&gt;When a new investor goes onto Coinbase, they will see two Bitcoin's

False. They see Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. Not the same.

&gt;What the scaling debate appears to me is different philosophical, technical and economic views on what should happen and how it should be scaled. If you have a different opinion, that is what it is, a different opinion. 

This is a fantastic example of today's zeitgeist - We all have opinions and they are all equivalent. Well, sorry to break it to you, that's not the case.

Unless you've spent, say, at least 1000hrs talking, reading and thinking about bitcoin, your opinion is irrelevant. That's harsh to accept because it contradicts the zeitgeist where we are all special snowflakes, but it's real. You wouldn't consider the opinion of a high school student on quantum gravity to be equivalent to the opinion of a tenured professor, would you? It's the same here.

And it just so happens that some ~90% of the technical community, i.e. the ""tenured professors"", agrees that scaling on-chain is a no go **if you want to preserve the key properties of bitcoin: Censorship resistance, immutability and trustlessness**. Of course, there is a ~10% of tech people who disagree, fair enough. But just keep in mind that you also have ~10% of climate researchers who disagree about global warming.

&amp;nsbp;

The story is long, the rabbit hole is deep, and you are doing exactly what is expected from a journalist who has no idea about what he's talking about: Talking about ""different opinions"", and arguing or some sort of ""peace"" (if we only all got along...) You must understand one thing, and accept it for what it is - The community has split, and the ""debate"" is over. You are late to this party, and the rift has happened. Bitcoin scales off-chain, Bitcoin Cash scales on-chain. Let's observe the evolution of the two systems. Talking about the ""block size debate"" is equivalent to beating a dead horse at this point.

No. At the price of $1300 or so, it's losing. There's a mountain of fiat monetary base, debt, plus derivatives out there that need to be subsumed on order for gold or Bitcoin to take over as money. I'm taking about complete monetization as the win. The fact that the pace and rhythm of bitcoins price action over the last 9y has simply blown gold out of the water shows beyond a doubt, in my mind, that Bitcoin is winning hands down over gold.

Fiat gives all created money to the central banks. It's completely disingenuous to claim that is a more egalitarian system.

"Global Intel Hub) -- 5/12/2018 -- Bitcoin is now the talk of the town (Wall St.) and yet we don't know who created it. There's lots of theories, but we haven't seen any documented evidence. Having experience in this business looking at the FX markets melt down over the last 10 years in a fraud climax, we wrote Splitting Pennies and explained the world isn't as it seems. That was before Bitcoin. Because like for any investment you want to do your due diligence, we started peeling back this onion and wanted to start from inception - and find out who created this (as just like with any investment analysis, it's another data point). What we found was astonishing - nothing! No documents, no photographs, no reports, from Satoshi. Whoever it was created a real pseudonym in order to mask their real identity. But why? Now the value of Satoshi's original coins would be in the tens of billions - why not claim them? It is our logic that it can only be someone or some group connected to the US Government, an employee perhaps - not necessarily that Bitcoin is the brainchild of the government, although that is possible as NSA has the best mathematicians in the world. We compiled this research into our leading hypothesis in an article here: EXPOSED: The real creator of Bitcoin is likely the NSA as One World Currency

Our point is not that we know 100% that this is the case, simply that it's the most plausible story, and we haven't uncovered any evidence to the contrary. Lots of people have different opinions, but they haven't produced any document proving otherwise. So we wrote the NSA and asked them, did you create Bitcoin? Hey, we are taxpayers. They work for us. Don't forget that! Their response was not surprising, they said ""That's Classified"" -

Also, I’ve worked with Overstock as a vendor (3rd party seller).

"&gt;Correction, what I meant was Satoshi *not considering how L2 could be a potential solution to scaling, and therefore making a 'ruling' on it, doesn't make sense, if in fact he did disagree with it on technical grounds as a possible way to scale. 

&gt; He discussed SO many other facets of 'bitcoin will be this but not that,' that if he really disagreed with L2 as a way to scale, I think he would have outright said it, so I don't buy the 'well it was implicit' argument, unless someone can illuminate further how it was implicit. 

Ah ok. So you're wondering if he explicitly weighed in on this bizarre notion that, rather than allowing the actual Bitcoin blockchain to scale, we can instead build *other* ""L2"" networks *on top of* Bitcoin and that those other networks could somehow constitute a ""solution to scaling."" Yeah, I'm not aware that there was anyone pitching that particular bit of nonsense before Satoshi went silent, so I'm not sure he would have had occasion to comment on it.  But it *should* be pretty obvious that so-called ""second-layer solutions"" cannot obviate the need for actual (i.e., ""on-chain"") scaling.  https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8hup19/three_years_ago_today_bitcoin_developer_mike/dymuwlt/

&gt;so like I asked earlier, clearing up if he ever specifically state all primary TXs *had to be on chain* and why, would lend a lot of credence in my mind to the BCH is Satoshi's vision approach. 

I'm not sure what you mean by a ""primary"" transaction? But no, obvoiusly Satoshi didn't think that all transactions ""had to be"" on-chain. Again, he expressed skepticism that Bitcoin would be practical for ""overly small micropayments."" But he explicitly did think that Bitcoin could scale massively, and that Bitcoin could handle ""the top of the micropayment range."" As I've written before: there will always be a natural balance between money proper and money substitutes (i.e., on-chain vs. off-chain). The problem with an arbitrary limit on the capacity of the former is that it distorts that balance.",1526349121

"No it isn't, and you're rewriting history. The small block cartel is entirely responsible for the state of Bitcoin right now.

SegWit failed to take in a fair mining vote the first time by a wide margin (only hitting 30% signalling, Bitcoin Unlimited had 50%). *No one wanted that garbage but a small group of Core developers*. So they engineered the NYA to trick miners into supporting their contentious soft fork. SegWit was blocking the Bitcoin Unlimited upgrade, not the other way around. 

A lot of us supported SegWit2X as a compromise to at least move BTC forward an inch, reluctantly agreeing to SegWit if we at least got an on-chain bump. Roger Ver fully backed this compromise, but also promised he would 100% support the Cash fork if the 2X part didn't happen.

But as predicted by many as why else would the SegWit2X update be done in two parts, SegWit got activated, and mysteriously the 2X part was cancelled at the last minute because of a ""lack of consensus"" according to that weasel Jeff Garzik. It was revealed later that the 2X code was bugged and would not have even worked correctly as discovered by a few that were initially going to continue a 2X branch until realizing the BTC1 software was broken.

Everyone that supported 2X got behind Cash after yet *another* round of lies and secret backroom deals by Blockstream.

part of the fast transactionspeed is due to the fact that ripple doesnt need 'confirmations' after you send it. its consensus ledger, not POW or POS - If you send XRP between exchanges you dont have to wait 10-20-30 minutes before you can use it, so it can move very quickly.

&amp;nbsp;

i did a test recently, bought straight from FIAT - Ripple took 1 minute, ETH took 10 minutes and BTC took 40 minutes from moment of purchase till the moment i was able to use the funds freely on the exchange i send it to. Even if you dont like to hold it or wait for the usecase, its still very fast to use in between exchanges. If you want to send BTC from one exchange to another, selling it to xrp and sending it, buying btc back on the other exchange is actually faster than sending the btc over. Ofc you get a volatility risk, but this could be in your favor too, or the 40 minutes it saves you would mean you would be able to buy the coin you wanted to buy (assuming that would be the reason) quicker, and you might be able to get a higher profit due to a lower entry point

Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs is a 1976 book written by Niklaus Wirth covering some of the fundamental topics of computer programming, particularly that algorithms and data structures are inherently related.

The book was one of the most influential computer science books of the time and, like Wirth's other work, was extensively used in education.

The Turbo Pascal compiler written by Anders Hejlsberg was largely inspired by the ""Tiny Pascal"" compiler in Niklaus Wirth's book.

"Touche.  

Lets go a step further.    Gold was a ""proof of holding"" ledger.  

When you wanted to see how much gold you had you just looked in your satchel and you could see the balance by seeing what you are currently holding. 

Gold is a ledger.  You just hold it, and if you hold it you have access to spend it in the free market.  

If you don't hold it, you can't spend it.  

Bitcoin is better than this.  

Bitccoin is also a leger, just like gold.  But rather than holding the gold in your satchel you can just hold the digital key.  There are many ways to hold this digital key. Paper wallets, multi sig, hardware wallet etc.  

It's better than gold because you can send it instantly to anyone accross the internet, phone, radio or telegraph.  

You can hide it in plain sight.  

You can smuggle it accorss borders. 

You can hide your family wealth from Nazi's. 

You can run accross the world and when you get to the other side your bitcoin is on the cloud waiting for you.  (so long as you remember your key). 

Bitcoin is not digital gold because gold is very limited.  Bitcoin is digital goldV2.0.  It is like gold, but is a major upgrade able to work as not just a ledger for itself, but also as a smart contract, a title to realestate or any other colored coin idea you can think of. 

Bitcoin does everything gold does, except look pretty on your neck, and it does 100 other things in addition. 

So it's an insult to call bitcoin digital gold.   It would be like calling a light saber a digital sword.    

it's far more useful than gold, and therefore needs to be considered the next level in economics.

"&gt; 1) Regarding risk, FDIC - Insurance for your deposits up to 250K is a good policy that gives me a ton of confidence. That money is secure there and that ""risk"" doesn't bother me and should not bother anyone. That is insurance issued by a government whose treasury bonds has the highest credit rating on the planet and is the benchmark for all risk globally. Your cash on a ledger under your bed and your cash in FDIC insured account to me are equally risk-less. To argue differently is comparable to defending the construction of a doomsday shelter in your backyard.

This may seem irrational right up until the point you look outside your window and see a ton of dead birds and a river of blood.  I will argue the money in an FDIC insured accounts is substantially MORE risky.

First you need to breakdown and specify the different types of risk.  In some areas, the FDIC option is probably less risky, but in many important vectors of risk, it is far MORE risky.  First there is risk that your FDIC-insured money can be seized or frozen.  This can happen if you are accused of a crime, have a judgement entered against you from a civil case, targeted by the government WITHOUT being convicted of a crime, or divorced.  These are all very real risks to your money, even though im sure you will dismiss them as illegitimate.

But none of those are the real danger i see.   Your FDIC money is dependent on the underlying value of the currency.  Your nominal $250k you have in your FDIC account is insured but there is no insurance that the $250k will have the same value it does today. The underlying currency can simply go to zero.  There are many factors which affect the value of a currency, but one VERY important one is money supply.  I would even go so far as to say I cannot think of a currency collapse that did not occur alongside a monetary expansion.  

Time and time again governments have controlled money and for some reason it seems all these currencies seem to meet the same untimely end.  I'm sure you think this is not a legitimate risk, but consider that every holder of every fallen currency felt their currency was ""safe and sound"".  It's more like defending the construction of a doomsday shelter when the apocalypse occurs with predictable regularity.   Bitcoin has much less (zero) risk of monetary expansion.

&gt;2) My concern is that Banks which have the expertise and responsibility to extend credit for all of the activities I previously mentioned in my other comments do not have liquidity anymore. Those risk-less FDIC insured deposits grow their balance sheet and contribute to all sorts of economy-growing activities when that money otherwise would be sitting on an equally risk-less Ledger Nano under a pillow.

Have you ever heard the term moral hazard?  If banks were responsible for lending, we wouldn't need FDIC or bailouts.  Currently banks have a perverse incentive to lend irresponsibly.  If they take outsized risks and win they get to keep the profit, if they fail their losses are socialized.  In a free market, rates are set by the market--and those that DO have the expertise and willingness to extend credit responsibly, grow in economic power whilst those that do not, wane economically.

And you are still not listening to me about funds sitting under the allegorical pillow--THOSE FUNDS DO CONTRIBUTE GREATLY TO THE ECONOMY.  It is savings (and by this I mean hoarded currency--e.g. under a pillow), that allows an economy to grow and absorb damage.  When you use central planning to reduce savings below what they would otherwise be, your economy is more at risk to shock and less able to take advantage of good investment opportunities when they arise.  The housing crisis is one such example of how this can end badly.

Just to emphasis--saving capital under a pillow is probably doing more to allow for economic growth than money in an FDIC insured bank or loaned out at artificially low interest rates.  Until you understand how much benefit the cash hoarders provide to an economy, you are not going to understand this.",1526346788

"That is not the logical conclusion.

First, Bitcoin's supply is not fixed at 21 million. Every time it forks (or a new very similar crypto comes into existence) effective supply is increased.

Second, the 21 million cap can be changed by majority preference.

Third. the 21 million cap, instead of being an ongoing market-determined rate of supply like with gold, is not necessarily a plus. This could actually become a problem as people begin to refuse using Bitcoin for loans or contracts. We just don't know. Whether it's a good idea is completely speculative as it has never existed in a currency before and is not how gold supply works for any practical purposes.

Plus, gold is all those things you just mentioned when you use a service like a GoldMoney.

The only positive properties Bitcoin has that digitized gold doesn't are, arguably, complete censorship resistance and immutability of the ledger.

Meanwhile gold has positive properties that Bitcoin doesn't too",1526346543

Loading a lighting channel requires an “on chain transaction” meaning it uses the blockchain.  Now imagine if everyone in the U.S. were to be loading or unloading lightning channels this week.  You would have billions of on chain transactions.   The 1 mb -4 mb blocksize will never allow that many transactions to be confirmed.  So then the fees will rise for those willing to pay.  Similar to what happened a few months ago but it would be way worse. We would have to pay huge fees to basically take money from our Venmo account to our bank account.  Plus channels have to be online to be valid.  Which 

Then go try to teach your grandma about a lightning channel.  It will never work.  Btc will not raise the blocksize again.  Second layer solutions are what they have to rely on at this point.  But they have made it so complex adoption is a pipe dream.  

Lastly, btc fees only decreased because big player merchants stopped accepting it.  On chain scaling does work.  It’s really quite simple.  Have you read the history of rbtc?

"Thanks for this reply. I wasn’t aware of the Cambridge equation– I’ll check it out. It may turn out that MV = PQ is the wrong way to value Ether. My bigger point (which I didn’t fully express in the article) is that if we don’t have valuation methods for Ether, we have no idea if the return on investment will be positive or negative, even if Ethereum’s world-changing success is assured. It’s a Schrödinger’s cat of an “investment” — more of a blind gamble than an investment.

The mindset I want to shake people out of is implicitly using [discounted cash flow analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cash_flow) to value Ether. That is, treating the Ethereum platform like a company and treating transaction volume like cash flow. Some people explicitly think of Ether this way, and even more people just generally think there will be some positive correlation between the success and growth of the platform and the price of Ether because that intuitively makes sense. 

I think it only intuitively makes sense because the investment vehicle we’re used to is stocks. We’re inappropriately — or at least prematurely — applying our mental model for stocks onto cryptoassets, when this is a new asset class that might behave totally differently. Cryptoassets might behave more like currencies, for instance, and so have a negative correlation between the success and growth of the crypto economy and the value of cryptoassets. 

I made this mistake myself and invested in Ether because I was valuing it like some combination of a stock in a company and gold. Neither makes sense if the MV = PQ equation applies (which it might, or might not). I don’t think this mistake (if it is indeed a mistake) is at all uncommon. ",1526344842

That's not really necessary. 

First, you can buy fractional amounts of gold. 

Second, gold is generally used as a settlement form of base money to compliment ledgers of credit, and has been used this way for millennia. 

People don't often transact in gold directly generally speaking, and they never have. They transact in *credit* and redeem or settle in gold. That's what keeps the credit good. This is how gold has *always* worked as money, most of the time, in practice.

Third, if you're concerned about this, you can use a service like GoldMoney.

&gt;Those things come by default in bitcoin and they also cost money.

They cost a fraction of a fraction of a percent if you use a service like GoldMoney.

Unfortunately, Bitcoin does not come default with stable value storage relative to other assets. Each has its own benefits and tradeoffs, strengths and weaknesses.

Gold's tradeoffs is that it requires third party solutions for instant, effectively free, infinitely divisible digital transactions at the click of a mouse.

Bitcoin's is that it is not (and possibly may never be) as stable a store of value as gold, that its supply cannot fluctuate based on market demand, and that it doesn't work without electricity.

"I might be wrong, but it seems you are conflating 'impartial' and 'neutral'. A neutral approach, as it seems you are taking, might be objectively wrong. An impartial approach starts out neutral, but seeks to find an ""objective truth"", regardless of where that may fall on the spectrum between the two extremes. IMO it's important to be aware of this distinction, especially for journalists.

Going forward, I suggest pressing your interviewees more on providing empirical evidence in support of their arguments. 

For example, Core supporters will sometimes make arguments that take for granted the assumption that non-mining ""full nodes"" contribute anything to the enforcement of the network's consensus rules. They can provide no empirical evidence of this, because the assumption is completely false as per [the definition of proof-of-work in the whitepaper.](https://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf) If they were right, anyone with enough aws VMs could take over the network, and this is the entire reason proof-of-work is even a thing. Since this assumption is fundamental to most of the Core perspective on scaling, a neutral approach would be forced to accept the assumption in order to continue the debate, but it is objectively wrong, but an impartial approach would reject it.

On the other side, some BCH supporters argue based on the assumption that the vast majority of the network's hashrate is connected in a small-world network, as per the debate around so-called selfish mining. This is in fact a fairly reasonable assumption, because the miners have an economic incentive to be as closely connected as possible, but there is as of yet no empirical evidence to prove the assumption to be undeniably true. People who make arguments that take this assumption for granted should be called out on it. There are probably other examples as well, these were just off the top of my head.

I respect your time, so I'll be brief about my stance on on-chain vs off-chain scaling.

""Off-chain only"" scaling, as BTC has decided upon, is based on the assumption that on-chain scaling is impossible to keep decentralized, and is staking the entire network in the hope that the Lightning Network will function as promised, which from what I can see won't happen.

On the other hand, the availability of computing resources related to Bitcoin is getting exponentially better over time, and there is no indication this trend won't hold through any foreseeable future. Since the Bitcoin protocol has linear complexity, the **usage** of Bitcoin can increase exponentially without increasing resource-demands relative to availability. In other words, the block size limit could follow Moore's Law without affecting decentralization at all.

"First mover is it bud. BCH gets a lot of hate but there was no reason for block size to remain 1mb. Why not increase it to 2-4mb at least to prevent the mempool clog from december while lightning was being finished? 

Truth is blockstream cucked BTC so they could force layer2 solutions and satisfy investors. Increasing block size allows on chain scaling and does not increase centralization. Centralization will always be equal between BCH and BTC because the same exact machines will always be mining both chains. It is economic incentive which leads to centralization by forcing mining pools in order to reduce block reward variance and by encouraging large scale mining operations. Big block sizes just means pool leaders and the big operations will have to put some money into bandwith and memory instead of 100% into ASICS. 

The original plan was always to scale up blocks as our technology improved. Memory, bandwith, and processing power will continue to advance and become cheaper. There is no upper limit on block size over time. Layer2 can be useful but it should be added to a GROWING main chain. There is no reason to cap blocks at 1mb (or any limit) when our hardware will be able to support larger blocks with ease over time. In 10-15 years I imagine being able to spin up my own node on AWS or even my own home computer using my $50 dollar 10GBPS internet connection that will be able to process 1GB blocks. 

Just imagine if the situation had reversed. If BTC right now was the chain that went with on chain scaling and BCH was the coin that capped blocks and put layer2 lightning network first. BCH would be outside of the top 100; maybe completely dead. ",1526343986

Evidence that it is not used by banks:


New York Times have done pieces trying to document that it's not happening and there was a twitter war with the NYT journalist and Ripple CEO about this:

https://twitter.com/nathanielpopper/status/949081873405304832

- Actual use of XRP by banks is not something I've heard about. I find the run up absolutely baffling, as do all the blockchain folks I know at large FIs [Financial Institutions].

- XRP isn't used for anything. The hope is that some day it will be by banks, but there really aren't banks signaling that yet.

- In a few years we're going to look back on 2017 and think WTF were we thinking.


Forget that, Bankers in Ripple's own Swell conference have said they cannot use XRP:


Bankers on the panel:

- Paula Da Silva - Head of Transaction SEB (2nd largest bank in Sweden)

- Hirofumi Aihara - The Bank of Tokyo  (Japan)

- Darmesh Desai - Yes Bank (India)

- Richard Dell- Banco Santander (Largest Spanish Bank, operations all over the world)

Sure, your money as bitcoin on a ledger is safe and accomplishes exactly what you are talking.

Two points thought:

1) Regarding risk, FDIC - Insurance for your deposits up to 250K is a good policy that gives me a ton of confidence. That money is secure there and that ""risk"" doesn't bother me and should not bother anyone. That is insurance issued by a government whose treasury bonds has the highest credit rating on the planet and is the benchmark for all risk globally. Your cash on a ledger under your bed and your cash in FDIC insured account to me are equally risk-less. To argue differently is comparable to defending the construction of a doomsday shelter in your backyard. 

2) My concern is that Banks which have the expertise and responsibility to extend credit for all of the activities I previously mentioned in my other comments do not have liquidity anymore.  Those risk-less FDIC insured deposits grow their balance sheet and contribute to all sorts of economy-growing activities when that money otherwise would be sitting on an equally risk-less Ledger Nano under a pillow.

"**Argument to moderation**

Argument to moderation (Latin: argumentum ad temperantiam)—also known as false equivalence, false compromise, [argument from] middle ground, equidistance fallacy and the golden mean fallacy—is an informal fallacy which asserts that the truth must be found as a compromise between two opposite positions.

An example of a fallacious use of the argument to moderation would be to regard two opposed arguments—one person saying that slavery is always wrong, while another believes it to be legitimate—and conclude that the truth must therefore lie somewhere in between. One could imagine a society that accepts a midway position between slavery and non-slavery as truth using the argument to moderation, and it's only the cultural values of freedom and decency and the like, that would object. If these values did not exist then the culture might find the middle ground true.

Bitcoin removes the burden of trust in the counter party for a given transfer of wealth, but that trust\-less transaction requires a great deal of trust in the Bitcoin network \(the mathematics &amp; cryptography\), technology and mining community instead.

For the Bitcoin network to be trustworthy it must be as fully outside the control of any single entity or community or ideology as possible. Maximal representation of all facets of the global community of potential users is what makes the network maximally trustworthy.

Any change in the technology which increases the costs of participation in the network has the effect of reducing the number of potential participants int he network, thereby increasing centralization and ultimately reducing trust. Lower trust equals lower utility, lower utility equals lower value.

It is not possible to have a perfectly decentralized system, but it is possible to demonstrate unwavering commitment to the principle that regressive changes are flatly forbidden.

Given that it is technically impossible for all necessary transaction types to be accommodated by the blockchain, it is therefore necessary that the network \(engineering community\) devise solutions to execution of certain transaction types off\-chain. Until this technique and a few conforming implementations are mature, Bitcoin cannot become sufficient for all types of wealth transfer or storage.

'Larger blocks' do not solve the fundamental problem of handling off\-chain transactions, but they do increase the complexity and cost of participation in the network, thereby pricing some potential participants out. Any changes to the network which would increase the potential for centralization must be flatly rejected, even if it means accepting other limitations or negative effects.

It is worth noting that the dominant blockchain fork of Bitcoin \(BTC\) is not restricted to 'small blocks', since the underlying issue is actually the number of transactions per block. Solutions like SegWit have increased the number of transactions with a minimal increase in the number of bits per block over\-the\-wire. Adding off\-chain solutions like Lightening for instant, ultra\-low\-fee micro\-payments will further reduce the transaction load on the blockchain, also without decreasing the number of potential participants in the network. These are good. They are provably effective, and the data is in the public domain \(so don't take my word for it\).

For folks from my school of thought, the elimination of the benefit of ASIC miners would be far more helpful than going the opposite direction: larger blocks require larger computers and more storage and better networks, all of which concentrates the network in the hands of the \(more\) wealthy and creates myriad opportunities for injection of differentiating intellectual property that enhances and protects their control and advantage. In my view, BitMain is the arch\-nemesis of Bitcoin. I believe that ASIC mining technology and products need to become extremely widely available at extremely low prices \(e.g. completely commoditized and cheaper than a Raspberry Pi\) if Bitcoin is going to survive and prosper. Larger blocks are, best case, insufficient and worst case \(my view\), completely counterproductive.",1526341982

"**Gossip protocol**

A gossip protocol is a procedure or process of computer-computer communication that is based on the way social networks disseminate information or how epidemics spread. It is a communication protocol. Modern distributed systems often use gossip protocols to solve problems that might be difficult to solve in other ways, either because the underlying network has an inconvenient structure, is extremely large, or because gossip solutions are the most efficient ones available.

The term epidemic protocol is sometimes used as a synonym for a gossip protocol, because gossip spreads information in a manner similar to the spread of a virus in a biological community.

"&gt; I appreciate the thoughtful response. My belief is that deposits are good because it gets lent out to where liquidity is needed. If my money is in crypto, that money is sitting idle on Ledger doing nothing for anyone. Credit is not being extended from that deposit. I really think this is one of the things that irks me about banks going away.

I understand many people share the view you express here--that money sitting idle on a ledger is not doing anything for anyone or providing real benefit to the economy.

This pervasive view frustrates me beyond what you could imagine because it is ignorant and dangerously wrong.  I usually respond with dismissive hostility to people who spew this nonsense, but you seem like a decent person so I will try to articulate why this is very wrong.

I assume you have insurance.  The reason you have insurance is if your house burns down you would be in a bad situation without it.  Now imagine you have $500k in cash sitting in your secure vault.  Suddenly you would find that the need for insurance is not quite as great as you would be able to better handle an unexpected disruptive event such as your house burning down.

Similarly, you can extend this thinking to a corporation that has a large amount of unencumbered cash reserves.  Suppose such a company were hit with an unexpected disruption or economic shock.  Would they be better positioned to absorb this financial damage than a company that is ""fully invested"" by having it's excess capital loaned out?

We can further expand this thinking to consider whole economies where there are many people holding ample amounts of cash vs one that does not.  In the event assets start falling in value or the cash that was loaned out is suddenly defaulted en mass, it is the holders of cash who step in and absorb the damage of this unexpected economic disruption by buying up distressed assets.

That is the true value of money sitting idle--it provides the economy with much more resilience to unexpected disruption and allows people/companies/and even whole economies to take advantage of sudden investment opportunities.  Consider how restricted you (or your economy) would be if your capital were fully committed--you would have asset prices fall....and fall....and fall.  In a situation where there are adequate savers with idle cash, such disruptions are greatly mitigated.

This is because an idle currency provides you with a very valuable tool--the ability to remain agnostic and unencumbered and when you do, you signal the rest of the market which reacts accordingly and resources held back for the unexpected shock...which will inevitably come.  ",1526339814

Every day that Bitcoin increases in adoption, the value increases, and the probability of it falling out of favor decreases by virtue of how the market works: as more people become aware of it and its properties, more people will consider a valuable store of value, therefore more people will want to trade for it, therefore it comes closer to being a widespread currency.",1526339468

Kraken, Kraken customer support SCAM! Kraken SCAM! Kraken customer support phone number's are all scammers. They stole $40,000 from me!!! San Fransisco California

*Author of original report: Kraken crypto bitcoin EXCHANGE SCAM!
Ripoff Report
on the Internet.
I used Kraken for trading Bitcoin and built $7,000 into over $20,000 over a few months. When I tried to withdraw funds and move money I was scammed by their employees, them and possible ex employee scammers. 

This is a company that supposedly made billions last year with a captiol B. They get you frustrated by having no phone support at all and denying every bank wire request and any other type of request to withdraw you're money.

I finally googled ""Kraken customer support phone number"" There are at least 10 800's.

They said they could help me and got into my account and immediatly moved all my bitcoin to them then bought more bitcoin with my money and transferred it to them. 

Kraken said sorry they could not help me. REALLY!! ""Sorry but someone has gained access to your account without your permission"" This is what they told me. 

So your platform got compromised and you say ""sorry"" and not restore it. 

 

This company already got hacked in 2015 and they do not care. 

DO NOT PUT YOUR MONEY WITH THIS COMPANY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. IT IS A GREAT RISK. THEY STOLE OVER $40,000 FROM ME. THEY ARE A SCAM!! PLEASE TAKE THIS WARNING AND DON'T LOSE YOUR SAVING OR RETIREMENT OR ANYTHING FOR THAT MATTER. 

 

Please spread the word about this scam and this rip-off company.",1526339178

"Hi! First- really enjoyed the interview I listened to of yours.  Will listen to more.

Due to your well written post, I'd like to tell you my perspective however flawed it may or man not be.  I think one of things that confuse people when they enter this space is that they have no exposure to the path it took to get here.  Both big blockers and small blockers felt ignored for years- as bitcoin stalled in development and lost market share to alts.  Let me try to summarize:

BB history:
I would say big block devs think shorter term and want 'good enough' solutions right away (that's not a bad thing in many engineering situations).  Size increase discussions started with Gavin and Mike Hearn a LONG time ago.   Their focus was scaling for big business use.  Basic line of though- big blocks are such an easy concept to understand, right- it's so easy to 'just' change the size variable in the code why didn't we just do it?  Lots of big block thought leaders say it will work (Hearn, Gavin, Sirer, Rizun...).  We can trust the decentralization to the miners because game theory incentives force them to stay honest.  Finally Satoshi showed such genius in the derivation of all this that he is infallible- and he never said we should do x or y to upgrade so we shouldn't. SPV and 0-conf should give us what we need already to serve the world (especially for small transactions). Based on this history, it's clear to see that core is either incompetent, malicious, or a captured entity (Blockstream)... as there is no reason not do it.

SB History:
Small block devs think about issues in the long term and want things to be perfectly designed because we are talking about a monetary system here.  Replace by fee was the first big split.  Core realized that someday blocks could be full and the only way to get a spend through would be to change the fee.  This was ok because 0-conf can never be trusted without trusting all nodes/miners anyway, so there was no 'real' downside. Also, RBF is opt-in so.. again no downside even if you do want to trust 0-conf.  A list of problems emerged with bitcoin. Segwit is/was an elegant fix for many of them while provide scaling simultaneously- see https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits. It was also a soft for so it was guaranteed not to break any old clients, wallets etc.  Despite the brilliance of what segwit was, miners were not signaling for it.  Much like the big block summary above, based on all the goodness that SW it is clear to see that miners are either incompetent, malicious or are captured in some way (Bitmain).  

Hence both groups blame the other for hindering a scaling solution.

So in my opinion:
Both are sort of right.  We could handle bigger than 1MB blocks before SW was active and there was no reason not to active SW.  In addition I believe the agreements made were a joke as they people present had no right to make promises for all of the users of a world wide resource.

Why I am on the BTC side over all:
SW was ready for a year before it activated, during that year BCH forked off and disrupted the bitcoin hash rate which was a contributor to the full blocks.  In addition, blocks were full because the largest users of them were creating inefficient transactions.  The small blocks do act as a forcing function to make users to implement batching and adopt improvements to the protocol.  As a miner and a node operator I couldn't see why the main pools wouldn't vote for segwit- so I do buy that covert asic boost was a factor.  

As a miner and node operator I am afraid that the world will take advantage of free storage space. And, if the sizes are big there will be less nodes/mining nodes (I would have to drop out at some point) so it will be easier for governments to attack those left.  Therefore, having transactions off chain brilliant.  We won't have to store random coffee purchase for all of the future. Those transactions are not really worthy of the promise provided by a truly censorship free form of money. A private coffee purchase is not that meaningful. Therefore, I think the LN is amazing- settle that off chain!  Even if people only use it for small transactions great- even if it has a hub and spoke model, great! Even if if LN over all fails routing-wise and it becomes a way to buy a gift card to Starbucks (they run a LN node and you load the channel and use it one-way)- great!  Those all saved room in the blocks to hold more valuable transactions- like memos or whatever else. 

Thanks for reading if you did.  I may not have time to respond to replies today.

"Wow you really do think the most important caveat is anonymity don't you.. Satoshi Nakamoto himself declared anonymity was not specifically important to bitcoin. The immutable aspect comes from it's statelessness and the fact that bitcoin sent to a bitcoin address will be delivered without input from anyone except the user and miner he is paying to include his or her transaction in a block. The decentral aspect is thus that no central authority can command over an individuals bitcoin, protected mathematically by the alogithm and the concensus of nodes.. The guarantee of volume comes from the fact that it is the most widely used, accepted and developed blockchain with the most all around support. It is literally used as a reserve currency for all the alts..  
   
 The least important aspect of the Bitcoin network is anonymity. Time has proven so and will continue to. 99% of all participants are not interested in nor do they require anonymity in their transactions *at any level* whatsoever.",1526338262

 Reddit being a place for discussion, I more felt a need to answer your question.

Here's a more involved look into my thought process.  The adverb, ""only"" was not required to communicate that '8.5% of Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Traders Are Female'.  When omitted,  the statement reads as objective.  When included, the word ""are"" is modified and the statement becomes a claim that 8.5% now means something like ""almost none"" and the audience needs to read the article to learn why.

The article has 4 topics.

The first is demographics.  It explains that greater than 80% of traders are novices.  about 23.5% work in IT or finance.  30% are unemployed.  This seems to have no bearing on gender and little relation to the title of the article.

Topic two is ""Crypto Gender Imbalance"".  The author suggests ""while there could be other factors at play, bitcoin is located at the intersection of technology and finance, both fields that suffer from a severe gender imbalance, so the results are not all that surprising in that context."", but that doesn't really explain away the 86.5% of investors not working those sectors.  It does however use the phrases, ""severe gender imbalance"" and ""not surprising"".  The author has strayed out of reporting stats here and is giving me a reason to infer that ""Only"" has a negative connotation in the context of this article.

The other two topics are a gender difference in alt coin preference, and a call to action on commenting about how the bitcoin community can attract more female users.  There is an actual, bold-faced call to action here.  So I really do not think that I am off-base on this being a call to action to correct the gender imbalance.",1526337571

"I think in the end the final scaling will be a mix of both philosophies: Lightning \(or 2nd layer\) \+ increase in block size.

If we imagine a future with 3bn people using Bitcoin every day even for small transactions just increasing the block size would not be enough, you would need probably close to 1 peta\-byte blocks which would be difficult to circulate and validate through nodes in under 10 minutes.

But also Lightning alone at some point is going to hit the block size limit because you need a transaction on\-chain to open the channel.

I think it is healthy that there are 2 competing coins and this will allow the two strategies to co\-exist in the real world.

I also think it is sad that there is just FUD against each other instead of a healthy technical debate.",1526337509

"First read this short description...

&gt;The Peercoin network activated in 2012 and is one of the first cryptocurrencies to ever be released. It is responsible for inventing proof-of-stake consensus, which makes it the first efficient and sustainable public blockchain technology. It is extremely low-cost to operate and requires very little energy to secure. In addition, it is also the first blockchain capable of allowing its protocol rules to be governed directly by its users (coin holders) rather than external miners, making for a network that is more decentralized, democratic and easily secured by people all over the world.

&gt;The Peercoin Team believes that adapting blockchains for wide scale use only through on-chain transactions will negatively affect the decentralization level and security of the network over time, therefore we choose to develop the Peercoin blockchain as a base layer settlement network with a sole focus on securing all forms of value recorded into the chain. This can be accomplished through Peercoin's philosophy of preserving and maximizing decentralization (which increases security) by developing the majority of features and technologies on top of the blockchain, rather than directly into the blockchain protocol itself.

&gt;Thus the Peercoin Team focuses on developing second layer protocols and sub-networks that can interact with the base layer blockchain to adapt it for wide scale use and improve functionality such as tokens, smart contracts and high speed low cost transaction processing. In this way, Peercoin will act as a secure and censorship resistant base layer for the future blockchain connected world.

There is not much benefit when you're solely considering how transactions compare from one blockchain to another. The benefits that really matter are the fundamentals behind the network. The economics driving Peercoin's security model are designed to be long-term sustainable. The advantage is that it will still be around and securely functioning decades into the future while other blockchain succumb to economic and centralization failures. People have called Peercoin the nuclear bomb shelter of crypto in the past. It is because it was designed to last and that is a place I would want to store my tokens or other value.",1526337257

"Once you study deeper you'll soon realize the ""Turing completeness"" is not as cool as you thought, and is actually the one reason why Ethereum may fail if ever.

Currently ETH is 99% used for creating tokens (fungible or non-fungible) and neither of them require Turing completeness. Basically nearly everything on Ethereum today can be replicated on BCH.

Now, this of course doesn't include so-called ""self executing autonomous smart contracts"", but again, the more you study into this the more you realize how much of sci-fi fantasy this ""autonomous smart contracts"" is, especially considering how regulators are starting to apply laws to crypto, ""smart contracts"" will need to compromise with the real world law soon enough, which will probably undermine the only thing ETH has left going for it.

The way I see it, even these smart contracts are better implemented using a minimalistic protocol such as BCH.

Techically it already is in many ways.. Money laundering is illegal in all countries and using anonymous crypto doesn't somehow make it legal. People use Monero for that reason. Did you think the most important part of Bitcoin was anonymity? It never really was. If someone does not want to provide you service you shouldn't be trying to trick them into it or bypassing their ability to stop you anyway. If you need to though you can use an anon chain. Bitcoin will never be fully anonymous without sidechains and at that point you honestly might as well just use a full blown purpose built anon chain.,1526336456
"&gt; nope, higher fees

nope, lower fees. what you are showing me is an example of shitty wallet. There are fees on BCH network almost 300 sat/byte, but this does not mean that these are necessary. There you go with actual math:

Litecoin: 0.226 kb * 0.00001 LTC/kb * $140 = $0.0003668 in fees

Bitcoin Cash: 226 bytes * 1 sat/byte / 100,000,000 (divide by this to convert satoshis to BCH) * $1460 = $0.0033 in fees

I this tx i paid $0.0003668 in fees. Fees in LTC are 10x lower compared to BCH.

LTC has 0-conf as well. i am sellin web-hosting for ltc, accounting customers instantly. never had problems. I can create you invoice, can you please show me how will you hijack transaction?

And as you mention, most people, probably including both of us are here because of the dollar signs and not because of the groundbreaking technology.

To finish off, an investment which is valued by the network size, which eats capital when it needs to grow is pretty much the definition of a Ponzi\-scheme. In the least worst case it's just an other realisation of the Greater Fool Theory.",1526335973

3. Scalability: Lightning can do infinite number of transactions per second, but it's not clear if Bitcoin+Lightning can handle actual real-world payment schedules.

While it is true that there are more transactions per second, how many of those are by traders looking to move funds between altcoin exchanges and fiat exchanges?

nope, [higher fees](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/median_transaction_fee-bch-ltc.html#3m)

"&gt; Firstly, the idea that Satoshi can't ever change his mind about anything is beyond comprehension.

I don't know where you got that idea. did you bother to read the link I gave you.

I am saying that there is a very clear premise of something, that we all got into, then a small group tried to change that premise; which we felt was wrong.

We are into the bitcoin idea that was here for years, not the new btc one. is that hard to understand. satoshi just spend a lot of time very clearly outlining what that bitcoin is, how it works, how it will grow, and be used, again that described bch and not btc. 

&gt;I have read the white paper. I have gone through the internet archives and read a lot of what Satoshi has said.

I don't want to call you a liar but I don't actually believe you. You claim blocks should be small when every modeling of this every shows that's a bad idea, it's also not what bitcoin was desinged to be (the thing we are all here for) and it has been shown not to work. Now what evidence do you have to back up your opinion that all the early users and the creator of a system are wrong? I bet none, none at all. Unless you strangely (and again, against logic and emperical evidence) think non-mining nodes contibute to decentralization. But I also bet you can't come up with a rebuttal to that fact either.


&gt; Satoshi isn't around anymore, 

no, but the whitepaper and the outline of how bitcoin was designed to operate ( https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/ ) are still highly relevant as they are the reasons we are here.

we came for the bitcoin that you can see Satoshi explaining, not one that greg maxwell made up after some company paid him a few hundred thousand dollars. We don't want forced block scaricty, we don't want forced aritifical blockcap when there is not only no reason to have them but good reason not to have them.

&gt;about all sorts of information.

if you have any *data or facts* that show satoshi made an error in his plans and that bitcoin cash has a problem that would be different, but you don't there is every reason to think the bitcoin we used to use (bch) will work as well at it was designed to, there is little reason to think btc will succeed with full blocks and high fees and forced middlemen 


&gt;There are all sorts of bottlenecks where centralization can exist.

then that is up to you to define, if you don't say, 'core is controlled by a central repositpory that is rude to newcomers' when you talk about developer centralization (which bitcoin cash doesn't have) then people think you are talkinga bout 'decenttalization' which is what I posted, which is what it means without a qiualifier.

also, I see you have no rebuttal to the fact that non-mining nodes don't contribute to decentralization or security.

making a judgement based on who can run a full node (when it shows no actual investment in the game) is not only periolus to the future of the system you have in mind but it is a form of eletism where normal users can't vote, and people who actually have skin in the game (miners) are washed away by an easy to fake and non contributing things.

"Ok let me help you out here as you are apparently not really into crypto to understand different types of blockchain technologies and how to value their part of centralization and decentralization
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
decentralizing means that there is no 'one party' that controls the network, so in case of a giant fire, you cant reach your network. in case of bitcoin this is thanks to the POW structure of mining, some alts for POS and XRP is using consensus ledger.

&amp;nbsp;

the safety of the network depends on the amount of people that are helping you to 'carry' the load and process it. for POW you have mining, POS is staking, and consensus runs on validators/nodes. There is an incentive to POW and POS and the incentive of validators is voting right in a network. POW comes with costs - your electricity. POS comes with costs - you have to hold a large number of the altcoin and consensus has no costs but no direct incentives, but you will be able to get a say in the network. When it comes to POW the hashpower is your drive. YOu have to keep upgrading it to be able to 'beat' the costs you have to pay your electricity bills with - in a way, you are exchanging crypto mined and give it to electricity companies who are not investing this into crypto. 

&amp;nbsp;

POW starts very decentralized, but as its driven by extrinsic incentives - its purely driven by greed. If you can mine a coin whtere you receive more $, you stop mining what you were mining to mine that coin instead. POW means you have to invest alot of money to upgrade your rig, alot of your profits end up at electricity companies and as this is purely driven by hashrates - that you can purchase - the network is 'for sale' as you can possibly buy enough hashing power, or 'bribing' them by offering a better return at another coin, and a doublespend/51% attack is possible.  the extrinsic model where a higher hasrate brings higher rewards means this could theoraticaly lead to a more centralized future. Already we see 3 mining companies on bitcoin that control the entire network. 

&amp;nbsp;

when it comes to POS its important that the amount of coins are divided amongst the people who are staking. If one party owns 'alot' this means the network is more centralized. Also this person will get more as it owns more, thus it drives people to get more for a better reward. Again the reason for people to buy is an extrinsic incentive. Decentralization means that it would be best if not just a few parties own a large part of the staking. the extrinsic model where a larger amount of coins brings higher rewards also means this could theoraticaly lead to a more centralized future.

&amp;nbsp;

now consensus, its harder to decentralize as you start off more centralized, but as there is no extrinsic intensive but purely intrinsic driven rewards, there is no bribing (your goal is to run a good-validator, else the network will ignore you) and with new nodes popping up every day - nodes that have the same power and no need to 'increase the amount of nodes' to control the network as it will eliminate the bad actors and because there is no greed or chance of doublespend in case of XRP, this meas that the network is on a liniar upward movement in case of decentralization. With thousands of nodes running - new ones added every day - where each node has the same power instead of btc (3) and eth (5) this makes the network itself more decentralized than you would think. So XRP in this case becomes more and more decentralized with no chance of becoming centralized in the future.

&amp;nbsp;

If you are referring to 'decentralization' in regards to 'amounts on top 100 accounts' - please know that in case of xrp, 38% is owned by the top 100 accounts and this is including several very big exchanges that are being counted as 1 address as they use destination tags to split it amongst the users. So that 'centralized' arguement is extremely outdated and gives a very wrong perception of what is actually happening. Please stay up to date!",1526333270

I would however like to highlight that long term BTC and BCH can not co-exist peacefully. BCH is gaining on BTC in terms of Tx count, hashrate and price. Hashrate follows price, price follows utility and utility is best measured by Tx count. Since BTC has artificially capped its Tx rate, BCH will eventually have more tx, higher price and higher hashrate. At that point, BTCs claim of being more secure also goes away. This is when BCH becomes a better store of value (due to higher security) and  a better medium of exchange (fast, cheap transactions).  Success of BCH is a death spiral for BTC. ",1526331456

Because Bitcoin is decentralized there is no entity for the government to attack to shut it down. They can try and make it illegal and ban it but that is the best they can do, most likely governments will just join in using it instead of risking misding out due to it being a huge change in the way money works.

Same here. I think for many people crypto still doesn't feel like real money. Perhaps there will be some kind of psychological effect where people are much more willing to send in crypto instead of taking that hit of submitting credit card info.  ,1526331039
why do you make anti crypto laws but then do this?,1526330989
"This is specifically about btc/bch ratio, not so much just more miners joining. The hashrate in general is increasing across both, what this shows is either A) More miners are slowly being brought on to BCH or B) Miners are moving from BTC to BCH. It's been a slow climb, but has been steadily increasing for awhile now.",1526330982
"Lightning is not Bitcoin, so if you want to bring a Blockchain to the masses Lightning is not an answer, neither will BTC be an answer, but BCH will be.

LN is centralized.  You may run your own node, but that means nothings.  It has nothing to do with centralization as it pertains to crypto.  It can be confusing, which is why a group has begun chanting decentralization as a necessary thing.  They are being misleading.  Decentralization means that there is not one path or a couple of paths my broadcast will travel, to the miners.  It needs at least 3 miners, but it does not need 1,000's of nodes, though that can help.  LN is a hub and spoke technique.  It is now and likely always will be, or that is how it appears.  It is centralized.  It may be able to route around a failure, but that is a pretty big may.  It would not be hard for a state actor or massive corporation to control enough of the nodes to ensure that almost all transaction move through them.  If they block you, you cannot communicate your transaction, you may not even be able to cash out, your money may very well be lost to you.  That is why it is not a replacement for a functional, scalable blockchain.  That is why it fixes none of the problems that Core has created for BTC.",1526330953

"You can’t mine Bitcoin with a GPU at a profit. You probably can’t even get a share submitted before it’s stale, and you’d be operating at a loss if you could.

"Sorry guys but i dont think this consensus is going to spark a huge bull run like previous ones. Here's why""

1. We had formed a huge bubble, inflating the overall price and market cap of crypto to highs in only months. That bubble popped around January, fueled by constant regulation issues and other issues including the Bitconnect scam. This bubble pop does indicate that crypto mc and overall growth will not be as rapid as it was years ago.

2. People are already expecting the prices to surge due to the consensus. This usually ends up bad. remember sell the news and buy the rumor.

I believe that crypto will have its bull run again. However, i dont believe its going to simply happen as a result of a 'consensus' event. Clear government stance on crypto, stabler growth, etc is fundamental for overall growth of this market. ",1526330872
You can use nicehash or mine other coins and trade them for BTC on an exchange.  whattomine.com and /r/gpumining should have plenty of resources to get you started.  ,1526330839
"So what do you think is important in Bitcoin? 

What is your evidence for the core contributors being centralized? When I did my own research, blockstream only had about 4 active members out of around 30. And there is a history of debating and discussing the future path. From what I can see, the blockstream developers strongly believe in decentralization and have been rather vocal about it. 

If you really think that a ""hub"" switching off on LN will cause censorship, then your research on the lightning network is rather one sided. You should maybe try it first, then comment on wether or not you think someone can stop you from making a payment. I currently have 8 payment channels and more people connecting to me over time. I only opened 4 of those channels. Payments were difficult to make 2 months ago. But are now I have no issues. This is going to get more streamlined with time. 

Fees are not $20. Most of my fees are about 11 cents. Which is still too high. I admit. But that's why I have a lightning node as well.

"After the never-ending BTC vs. BCH wars and the non-stop shilling of high-profile projects such as VEN and EOS, how hilarious would it be if fucking KIN is the coin that gains widespread adoption and makes everyone rich?

"Man nobody can have a logical argument today it’s like everyone is thinking on emotion.

"Its close to true but not quite; rather than *all* bank deposits, bitcoin would only necessarily replace all ""foreign reserves"". So purely domestic assets would not automatically be backed in bitcoin. Its unclear is the eurozone would work as one economy or not during bitcoinization; the greek currency crisis shows that not all euros are fungible. 

If bitcoin was available during this kind of crisis, and enough greek exporters chose to accept it, it would have easily averted the entire event.

"It looks like there are high barriers to entry, as with any current usage of the lightning network. In order for crypto-based systems to gain adoption, the user experience and onboarding processes will need to be equally if not more easy/accessible than non-crypto alternatives.

"&gt;Once issued, the stable supply is actually a good thing for sustainability.

That remains to be seen. It could be an issue that the supply cannot increase based on market demand vs. cost to produce. It could be a fatal flaw that keeps it from being useful as a unit of account and as a form of money on which to base contracts and loans. 

We simply don't know if that will work, because it has never yet existed in any form of money. It could very well be that a crypto or a Bitcoin fork that better mimics gold overtakes the current version of BCH. We just don't know. The statement above is purely speculative and unproven.

"I've used overstock plenty and never had even the slightest problem. 

It's honestly sounding like you sent your money to the wrong address and thats why they are redirecting you to coinbase(coinbase will reverse the transaction if it is an account they own). Overstock isn't going to issue you a refund because you never gave them any money to refund back to you.

Overstock isn't out to steal your money, they have plenty. If they say they didn't receive your money then they didn't receive your money. Their whole crypto checkout is automated so it's not like Tom forgot to check for your payment. Double check your deposit address this time so you can sleep better knowing where the mistake was and in the future you should tripple check your deposit addresses. With crypto you have to remember that **you adopt all responsibilities for your money**. There is no insured bank to fix the issues if your money gets lost or stolen. If a transaction gets messed up anywhere in the chain you are on the hook for it 100 percent of the time: this is the agreement people make with each other when they manage their own private keys

I really hope you get your free polo, and they just comp that for you, but I highly highly doubt there was any negligence by Overstock in this circumstance because you didn't even get past the payment part of the process. You got an automated cancelation by a computer who's only job is to check if the address they gave you received a deposit that met the threshold. That computer's job is very very very simple and it is telling overstock that you didn't not pay them the amount of money that you owe then to complete your transaction.

Best of luck with this all. Hope it gets worked out in the end.",1526330603

"No, inevitably you will have a position. Acknowledge your limitations but don't be afraid to let the audience know you lean one way or the other. Objective journalism is a myth. Truth does not fall neatly in some golden middle between two schools of thought. 

Such a journalistic culture is easily gamed by one faction shifting the Overton window, as Core has done repeatedly (need a cap of some sort, 20MB too big, 8MB too big, 2MB only with Segwit, actually no 2X just Segwit and blocksize increase someday, actually ""there is no consensus"" for a blocksize increaze). The ones who are right and stick to the original vision don't have the luxury of moving the Overton window, since any move away would *ipso facto* be a move away from what is right. Bam, instant bias introduced by the effort of journalists to be unbiased. It's a fool's errand. Be opinionated or at least skeptical and learn. 

By the way, the whole idea that non-mining ""nodes"" keep miners following the rules is bogus for this reason, which I will leave without expectation of reply since I know you're busy today: Bitcoin is predicated on miners following the rules, as it is in their best interest to do so. If this weren't the case, a rogue miner's best (here meaning most damaging) move is to collude to 51% attack the network. Crucially note that *non-mining clients are defenseless against this attack.* Meanwhile, SPV wallets work flawlessly as long as that basic premise holds. The only edge case where a ""full nodes"" (in quotes because nodes mine, see whitepaper and Bitcoin 1.0 readme.txt) can help is one where miners go insane but on a dumb way where they do a feeble invalid block attack instead of the much more effective 51% attack. And even then it is only a matter of waiting for additional confirmations thanks to the convergence dynamics of the Keynesian beauty contest in blocks that every miner participates in.",1526330531

"&gt; Yeah, who needs a mortgage at competitive market lending rates anyway.

Competitive market rates =/= current artificially low interest rates set by the Federal Reserve.

&gt;If half of the liquidity at a local mortgage lender is gone because it is sitting in digital wallets doing 0 when the same amount of people needing a mortgage exists what do you think will happen to your interest rates? 

The interest rates will adjust to ""competitive market lending rates"" you mentioned above.  Trust the market--it is better at pricing things including interest rates than a central authority.

"If the technical side is too difficult for you maybe the political will be clearer. This is not a simple technical argument where one side thinks LN is the best scaling solution and the other thinks on\-chain is the best. What i and many others contend is that bitcoin has had a takeover by the same forces that rule the old money system. It's not as much a conspiracy as a simple inference. I'll lay out the gist for you:

LN is funded by something called Digital Currency Group. This group is composed of old\-world players with the fricking head of the FED as the chairman. Mastercard has also spit in money... Now, LN just happens to fall under existing KYC/AML laws which ultimately means that all the properties that made bitcoin great will be rendered moot and void. If LN sees the light of day\(which to be honest i think is a secondary objective for the forces at play. I think their primary goal was to destroy bitcoin as it was growing too fast and too great\) the same forces of the old system will be able to control the new system and they will also ""prove"" that blockchain cannot work except as a settlement system for an old\-world network \-\- three birds with one stone.",1526329957

"You are absolutely right, it's very difficult to find impartial information on this subject most articles on it tend to be more shilly than informative on both sides of the aisle, purely because of the amount of greed in the crypto sphere. 

I am personally glad that BCH forked BTC as it gives us 2 different takes on how to scale, BTC is taking the adding layers approach such as the Lightning Network whilst BCH is focused on block sizes and ways to increase the number of transactions in each block without increasing the block size by adding new protocols such as [Graphene](https://news.bitcoin.com/graphene-block-propagation-technology-claims-to-be-10x-more-efficient/). 

BCH is trying to make 1TB block sizes which will trend BCH towards centralisation as the financial barrier to entry is huge so the number of full nodes will taper of as it becomes impossible for people to find the seed money for this venture. [This video](https://youtu.be/PKFkhWWiLDk) should give you a good insight to the amount of money required for hardware alone  however the bandwidth issue isn't addressed at all and that is the main problem for me personally.

BTC on the other hand is very reliant on innovation and could see stagnation when it comes to scalability. Both have their own problems and I am very excited to see how each will solve them.

With all that said however BTC &amp; BCH are going to have an up hill battle when it comes to being the most used transaction cryptocurrency as there is currently a token that is going to be using a Proof of Use distribution model and in essence it will be providing a financial incentive for adoption and we all know the best way to get someone to adopt something is through bribery. So this whole scaling debate between BTC &amp; BCH could prove to be useless. Also Nano is free and very fast buuuuut they still haven't got the tech working to an acceptable level yet.",1526329576
"They have nothing to do with your question re what makes a multisig centralized that's for sure!

&amp;nbsp;

As for what they are, you know as well as I do. But the problem you're sticking your fingers in your ears over is that for you to *open a payment channel with someone* an agreement must be reached. You are *relying* on someone else, and thus it is no longer decentralized.

&amp;nbsp;

If I want to send you BTC, you don't have to agree or disagree, I can do it, because BTC is a decentralized network. You can't stop me giving you money! But in LN, counterparties exist, on whom you must rely to be able to do as you wish. And that reliance is at the cost of decentralization.",1526329570
Yeah I totally agree they're natural. It's just working through new tech. It's just that there hasn't been a longstanding proven solution like we have with bitcoin. Relatively long considering the tech anyway lol.,1526329447
"For me the situation is very cut and dry. I don't understand all the drama around this. At the end of the day, consensus has chosen the Segwit/LN path. I was originally I supported big blocks, at least as a temporary crutch for last year's ridiculous fees. However, at the moment I'm very excited about Segwit and LN adoption. Consensus has chosen this path. The Bitcoin Cash community is only stealing the Bitcoin brand at this point, using positions of power that aren't governed by the blockchain (bitcoin.com, /r/btc, twitter.com/bitcoin, and to some extent Craig Wright's claim to be Satoshi) to try to exert control over the brand.

you don't need to stay neutral. Actually, you also don't need to necessarily choose a camp. I think people tend to see this as football fans, but this is finance and technology, ideology too of course, but mostly finance and technology.

In this respect I see an increasing tendency of people saying ""both do this, both do that"", but I find it very unfair as I don't see any brigade of BCH supporters harassing people or businesses that signal support to other projects, I don't see them employing censorship, I don't see them talking about stupid lambos all the time.

BTC community became rotten to the core (pun intended), but personally I support BCH because it has far better roadmap, functions better already, has many devs in different teams and has proponents that really believe in it passionately, such as roger ver, rick falkvinge, just to quote some.",1526329428

Even a teaspoon of censorship can change the face of a discussion forum; the /r\/Bitcoin mods have unloaded an entire dumptruck worth of censorship on that forum every single day since mid-2015.

"As far as I'm aware it's the main argument. People talk about Bitcoin being used as cash and forget that it was made in the wake of the 2008 credit bubble bursting: excessive speculation on bad debt led to foreclosures which caused banks to nearly collapse. The banks were extended credit to keep them afloat. The reason that worked was because people had no one else to turn to, so they essentially had to stay with the banks regardless of their demonstrated poor management/judgment/credit.

"Let me answer by taking your important points and why they fit Bitcoin Cash better:

1. Decentralized. Decentralization is only as good as it's weakest link. The Core development team is incredible centralized and does not accept anything that goes against their agenda (pushing for second layer solutions).
2. Scarce. Same as BTC.
3. Censorship Resistance. The network is the same as BTC. Note that if BTC moves to LN as their primary means it will be more acceptable to censorship as there will be central hubs which could shut down heaps of users. On chain is practically impossible to censor.
4. Banking the unbanked. You cannot do that with +$20 fees. Note that some Core developers *celebrated* when that happened. Meaning they do not plan nor prioritize this, not with their move towards BTC as a settlement layer.
5. Accessible. BCH is more accessible since it doesn't price out people with high fees.

In closing I want to note that ""Available in the third world"" won't be possible with BTC's settlement layer and +$20 fees. BCH will be cheap enough for that use case.",1526328464

"You're view of people that HOLD as being paranoid doesnt exactly hold water as well as your view that people only get into crypto to ""get rich quick"".

1. Personal financial freedom from corrupt banks and the banking system
2. Increased liberty through immutability and decentralization
3. Freedom to choose ones own money instead of being forced to use the money of your country origin
4. Wealth generation from an arguably risky investment into a potentially world changing technology \(""Get rich quick""\)

"To really understand the scaling debate on a technical level, you have to step back from the politics &amp; ideology, and just focus on what it takes to build a distributed, coherent, world-wide consensus on something. This is what it all comes down to at the end of the day.

Spoiler alert: *Any* decentralized payment network faces the same basic limits. On-chain scaling just happens to be the simplest &amp; most secure.

First, it's worth pointing out that money *is* communication. It's a way of agreeing on who has what value. There are many ways of doing this, from passing around metal coins to trusting the banks to maintain a centralized ledger. Since we are talking about digital value, we need a digital way to agree on who has what value.

Next, we want the property that anybody can send to anybody else in the system. Without this property, scaling is easy \- just make hundreds of alt\-coins! As soon as a coin starts to get full, just start another coin to soak up the extra network load. This sucks for usability, though. If I have BTC, and you want DOGE, I need to do some kind of exchange before I can pay you. In this scenario, there is no ""one\-world\-currency"", but thousands of tiny currencies and a network of exchanges to make it all work. Scaling is only a problem if you want a single world currency with perfect fungibility.

If you want to send this one-world currency to a random stranger out of the 7 billion people in the world, you need to do two things:

1. Find a path to that stranger on the network.
2. Communicate value to that person in a way that the other 7 billion people agree on what happened.

You need to solve *both* problems at once, or you don't have a payment system. With on-chain scaling, problem 1 is easy and problem 2 is hard. Lightning makes problem 2 easier and problem 1 hard. By ""hard"" I mean, ""it involves tracking all 7 billion people at once.""

If Bob wants to pay Sally (a stranger) over the Lightning network, his phone needs to know what channels to use. Either Bob's phone keeps track of the channels for all 7 billion people to find a route, or Bob needs to rely on a third-party service. If Bob's phone only tracks the channels of 1/10 the people in the world, that means Bob only has a 1/10 chance of even finding Sally, so it's not useful to only follow part of the network. If Bob uses a third-party service for routing, Bob's phone can verify that the route works before it sends the funds, so the system is still ""trustless"". If a server starts misbehaving, Bob can just switch to another one.

These central routing servers need to know the state of all channels at all times, which means they must observe every transaction on the network. A healthy Lightning network would need many of these servers, so the number of servers observing all transactions is your level of decentralization. The routing servers are necessary for the system to work right, but they don't control the integrity of the funds - the Blockchain and channel cryptography do that.

For Bitcoin, if Bob wants to pay Sally, he just broadcasts a transaction with Sally's payment address. There is no ""routing"". The transaction goes straight to the miners, who need to check for double-spends and other problems as part of the consensus mechanism. Once the miners do their work, they publish an economic proof that the transaction is valid (a block hash). This is the same economic proof that secures the Lightning network, so you either believe that Bitcoin mining works, or you don't believe in Lightning either.

These mining nodes need to observe every transaction on the network to do their jobs, just like the Lightning routing servers. The number of independent miners is the degree of decentralization in the network. At this point, both raw Bitcoin and Lightning have the *exact same* scaling requirements. They both require multiple independent services with enough resources to observe all transactions. This is simply the nature of having a coherent, decentralized, world-wide payment system.*

Where Bitcoin and Lightning differ (and this is the crux of the argument) is where the trust comes from. With Lightning, the giant servers that see all transactions *do not* provide trust. They simply provide independently-verifiable information. With on-chain scaling, the same miners that process all transactions also provide the root of trust (the block hashes). Some people are not comfortable having the root-of-trust be expensive to create. These people generally like small blocks and hate ASIC's. They believe that somebody in their basement should have as much say as a giant company with dedicated server farms.

The big-blockers don't mind that the root of trust is expensive to create. There is enough money to be made that plenty of companies will invest in the equipment needed to make this happen. So what if it costs $50,000 a year to run a Bitcoin node? By the time we get to that level, everybody on the planet will be using Bitcoin, blocks will be in the 1 TB range, and tons of companies will be willing to pay that price (basically the whole world economy). Besides, mining is *already* expensive.

* Note that I'm assuming a fully-pruned blockchain. This is all that is needed for a working payment system. If you want to record all previous activity, then to be completely fair, you should put the same requirement on the Lightning network as well. After all, historical data is historical data. Otherwise, you just need the most recent UTXO set and the block hashes for a fully-functional on-chain payment network, which costs about as much as tracking the current channel states.",1526327751

For years their FAQ roadmap claimed a block size increase would be necessary. Lightning white paper itself claims block size increase is necessary. The plan was to raise the block size. BIP 91 only got support from miners because it was thought that an increase in block size would be allowed not long after. Core decided they would rather split the chain and become an alt\-coin than allow a block size increase and the miners backed down for social reasons.

"This graph is a relative comparison between two hashrates. I'm assuming it is a global average.


People say ""hashrate follows price"", but that doesn't really explain it. If you really want to know why then you need to understand the protocol better:


Hashing is a function of the [Bitcoin](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/whitepaper) protocol.


In the Bitcoin case, when mining computers are validating blocks of transactions to add to the chain, each mining computer generates a series of hashes until a specific pattern is found. If/When that pattern is found the computer that finds it gets a mining reward. Some computers can now calculate trillions of these hashes every second in an attempt to find the pattern - this speed increases the probability of the rate of reward. It's all about probability.


But there are additional parts of the protocol that incentivize ever-increasing mining activity, that is an algorithm that controls an average rate of how many of these blocks (and thus rewards) are found, with a target of around 1 block every 10 minutes. That algorithm is called the Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm (DAA).


So a higher hashrate (both globally and locally) means that there is slightly more probability of obtaining that block reward. A better DAA means that there is slightly more probability the reward will be higher by mining Bitcoin Cash.


So ""hashrate"" is how fast these hashes are created (charts usually show a global average) by the computers participating in the Bitcoin protocol as part of ""proof-of-work"" required to secure the history of the ledger. That's why its up to petahashes-per-second now.


If the hashrate is slowly going up, it means that the reward opportunity or probability of ""finding the pattern"" and getting a mining reward is slowly increasing. This is good news for Bitcoin Cash because it means joining the Bitcoin Cash protocol as a miner is slightly more profitable/rewarding. The DAA is also attractive to miners simply because having a more predictable average helps with profit calculations.

1) Decentralized - High fees make the blockchain unusable for most transaction types.  It prevents most people from being able to use it.  The solution is pushing people off of the blockchain and on to payment channels that are centralized and very much vulnerable to censorship.

2) Scarce - With Core's plans for softforks, overruling consensus or changing the definition of consensus to meet whatever metric they can claim to excel in, it seems quite plausible that they can change the number of coins.  Or they do not even have to, because they no longer plan for people to use Bitcoin, nor Segwit coin, but LNcoin and they can make the rules up there as they want.

3) See 1.

4) Banking the Unbanked - BTC is too expensive for these people and LN is just banks with a different name.  Still too expensive for these people.

5) Accessible - BCH wins here hands down.  It is cheap, scalable and able to onboard many people and many applications.  Sending Bitcoin by SMS text message? Not going to happen on BTC or LN, for awhile anyway.

"The question is as follows, don't mind my subpar translating skills.

Bitcoin is a digital currency that only exists online. It has existed since January 1st 2009 and can be used as payment method in webstores and for other online services. Bitcoin is not, like standard money, made by a central bank. Instead, all bitcoin that exist are created by having computers participate in solving specific mathematical problems. This works as follows: everyone can run special software on his or her computer that participates in solving such a mathematical problem. The owner of the computer that solves the problem receives 25 (newly created) bitcoin as a reward. Because it was the case that in 2014 such a problem is solved every 10 minutes, 25 new bitcoins were created every 10 minutes. 
On January 1st there were (approximately) 12.2 million bitcoin. 

**Question A:**
Assuming the above, calculate in what year the amount of bitcoin exceeded 18 million, given that the speed at which they are introduced does not change. 

**Solution:**
Each day there are 60/10*24*25 = 3600 bitcoin to be earned. Given that there is 18-12.2 = 5.8 million bitcoin left to be earned, that's 5.8*10^6/3600 = 1611 days, bringing us from 2014 to 2018. 

In reality the rate at which bitcoin are introduced does not stay equal to 25 bitcoins every 10 minutes. This rate reduces. During the first four years, from January 2009 to January 2013, the reward was equal to 50 bitcoin. The reward gets reduced by half every four years: from January 1st 2013 to January 1st 2017 the reward is 25 bitcoin, for the next four years it is 12.5, and so forth.

**Question B:**
calculate from which year on the reward will be less than one bitcoin. 

**Solution:**
the amount of bitcoin y given as a reward is given by y = 50*0.5^x where x is the amount of 4 year periods that have passed since January 1st 2009 (the first period is given by x = 0). So we need to solve 50*0.5^x = 1. In Mathematics A you're allowed to solve this directly with your calculator, else just divide by 50 and take the log. This gives that x = 5.6, so it will be after 6 periods. 6*4 + 2009 = 2033.

The total amount of bitcoin that can be put into circulation is limited. This is partially due to the reward halving every four years. The amount of bitcoin that is currently in circulation can be approximated by the following equation:
C = 21 - 21*0.5^(0.25*t)
Here C is the amount of bitcoin in millions and t equals the amount of years with January first 2009 given by t = 0. 

**Question C:**
Determine the maximal amount of bitcoin that can be in circulation based on the above equation based on reasoning.

**Solution:**
0.5^(0.25*t) goes to 0 for large t, so that C = 21 - 21*0 for large t. The limit is therefore 21 million bitcoin.

To regulate the total amount of bitcoin in circulation, not only the number of bitcoin rewarded per solution is reduced, but the difficulty of the mathematical problems being solved is also increased. That is because more and more people use their computer to solve the problems. The difficulty of the problems being solved scales exponentially according to the equation

D = 3.65 * e^(0.533t)

Here D is the difficulty of solving the problem and t is the time in months, with T = 0 on January 1st 2013. Larger D implies that the problem is harder to solve.

**Question D:**
Write down the equation for the derivative of D and argue that D is an increasing function, that increases by an increasing rate. 

**Solution:**
The derivative is 0.533*3.65 * e^(0.533t) by virtue of how the derivative of e^x works plus the so called chain rule; if f(x) = e^x then f'(x) is e^x, and if g(x) = e^(h(x)) then g'(x) = h'(x)*e^(h(x)). Now, e^(0.533*t) is a positive number for t larger or equal to 0 so the derivative is positive and D is an increasing function, and e^(0.533*t2) &gt; e^(0.533*t1) for t2 &gt; t1 so that the derivative grows with time, leading to an increasing rate at which D increases.

The above formula for D can be rewritten in such a way that you can find the amount of months needed to reach a specific D.

**Question E:**
Rewrite the above equation for D in such a way.

**Solution:**
D = 3.65 * e^(0.533t), taking the log (= base e logarithm, they call it ln in Dutch high school math but I dont believe this is universally true) on both sides we get that log(D) = Log(3.65*e^0.533t) = Log(3.65) + Log(e^0.533t) = Log(3.65) + 0.533t*Log(e) = Log(3.65) + 0.533t so that we can write down that t = Log(D/3.65)/0.533 using the rules of the Log function (Log(x*y) = Log(x) + Log(y), Log(x^y) = y*log(x))",1526326420

False balance is a media bias in which journalists present an issue as being more balanced between opposing viewpoints than the evidence supports. Journalists may present evidence and arguments out of proportion to the actual evidence for each side, or may omit information that would establish one side's claims as baseless.

Examples of false balance in reporting on science issues include the topics of man-made versus natural climate change, the alleged relation between thimerosal and autism and evolution versus intelligent design.

False balance can sometimes originate from similar motives as sensationalism, where producers and editors may feel that a story portrayed as a contentious debate will be more commercially successful than a more accurate account of the issue.

"If you don't want to spread FUD for the hell of it and you actually believe in what you're saying, then it might be beneficial for everyone if you came up with an argument that had substance beyond saying stuff like, ""Governments can ban anything they want!""

I'll even help you out. 

In order for a government to ban or regulate something, they must first define what it is and classify it. For example, everyone here knows that crypto to crypto trades are subject to tax because of how the government classifies cryptos. 

How the government classifies something is very important. It's the same reason why people have been running around lately worrying about the government classifying ETH as a security. 

That said, these ""privacy coins""...what are they? Are they coins, tokens, gas/incentives/rewards to power a blockchain? Are they securities, commodities, or perhaps even currencies? Or are they just lines of code?

To reiterate, in order for a government to ban or regulate something, they have to define what that something is and then classify it. 

So if you're someone who likes to say, ""The government will just ban all privacy coins,"" then you don't know what you're talking about. At all. Full stop. 

But what about the underlying tech? Maybe they can ban that? Well, if that's your argument, you need to explain how you ban RingCT, stealthaddresses, zksnarks, etc. It wouldn't be possible.

Not to mention we saw how the previous attempted ban on cryptography went.

In addition, the supposed motivation behind any ban would be to prevent the use of using ""untraceable"" cryptocurrencies due to their illicit use in money laundering and tax evasion. But in order for any crypto to be used in money laundering or tax evasion, you'd still need a crypto --&gt; fiat gateway where you could cash out large amounts of money while avoiding detection/identification, and currently, there's no quick, solid, efficient way to do that.

To be sure, govts aren't worried about normies getting away with a $1k tax-free profit on cryptos; they're worried about the big players who want to cash out 6 figures without paying taxes. But people who have that kind of cash don't need to cash it out in places like the US.

They'll establish residency in a place like Puerto Rico which currently has an agreement with the US government such that if you establish residency there, you don't need to pay capital gains taxes.

(Let's sidestep the fact that big money is extremely influential when it comes to legislation, and big money would have the biggest incentive of all to disallow legislators to ban something which would negatively impact big money.)

Privacy coins aren't the keystone to tax evasion and money laundering.

"A 51% attack on the Bitcoin network is not something anyone can trivially accomplish, regardless of whether or not any ASIC manufacturer actually has the ability to take control of devices in the wild.

The Bitcoin network is a bit compatible to the United States Federal Government (not really, but it works well for a simplified real-world example) in that there is a separation of powers, with checks and balances.

The Fed is composed of three distinct branches: Legislative, Executive, and Judicial. Each branch has specific powers and responsibilities and each branch also has the power to check or limit the other two branches. The Framers chose this design in the hopes of creating a balance between all three branches, but in reality, the Legislative branch has the greatest number of checks on the other branches, with a lot of power over the Executive branch, and the Judicial branch is arguably the least powerful branch, because without Legislative and Executive action, it can't really do all that much.

Bitcoin is similar in that the network also has distinct ""branches"" of a sort, but the branches of Bitcoin seem to function more like how the three branches of the Federal Government were *supposed* to function. I'm not saying checks and balances in the Bitcoin network are perfect, but they certainly seem to implemented quite well. Continuing with this analogy, the six truly distinct branches of Bitcoin at this time are: Developers, Miners, Exchanges, Wallets, Merchants, and Users. Of course, branch distinction is a debatable subject, and one that will no doubt evolve over time as Bitcoin continues to grow, but for now, we'll stick to these six constituencies.

How does this relate to a 51% attack?

Well, if you're a entity in control of a large amount of miners, and you decide to manipulate the network in a certain way, you would need the other five constituencies to continue to follow your manipulated chain. Otherwise, you end up spending a lot of money on the energy needed to produce this manipulated chain, and if that chain isn't worth much to these other branches, then the money you spent on producing that branch has essentially been wasted.

This balancing of powers applies in every ""branch"" of Bitcoin. And just like the Federal Government, some branches are arguably more powerful than others. **But my point in this wall of text is that most people's concern about the centralization of mining is very over-hyped. Miners in the Bitcoin network are not comparable to the Legislative branch of the Fed, in that they certainly do not have the greatest number of checks on the other constituencies.**

ASIC manufacturers (and all manufacturers involved in the transistor industry actually) have begun to hit a wall for how many transistors can be incorporated into a chip. Moore's Law is coming to an end. Physics as we currently understand it just doesn't allow us to build reliable transistors past a certain point.

What this means is that, as the industry continues to grow, manufacturing costs become cheaper, which will lead to more companies getting into the ASIC industry (as we've just seen with Samsung), which means more decentralization in ASIC manufacturing. Also, purchase prices for consumers become cheaper as a result, which leads to greater decentralization in actual mining groups, which in turn, translates to an increase in system security, and because of ASIC architecture, this gain in system security can be done in a much more energy efficient way in comparison to the logistics of achieving an equal gain in system security while utilizing general purpose CPUs.

I know there are a lot of points here which can all be further debated on their own, but in summary, I think that there are many reasons why people need not be too concerned about the current implications of ASIC devices. Skepticism is healthy, especially in an environment like this, but I think it's only a matter of time before people start to realize that the benefits of ASICs far outweigh the disadvantages.",1526326135

"I agree with almost everything you state here.

The few points that I do disagree with are the following \- 

If you run a full node, you can signal your support for changes to Bitcoin in the future. You don't have to be mining for that. That does help decentralization. Just not decentalized hashing power. 

The ability to run a node on older hardware is important because the third world should be able to get a say on wether or not they can mine, or signal for future changes to Bitcoin. They are so far behind the 1st world in terms of what technology  is available to them.  If we increase the barrier of entry, then all we do is say ""you are allowed to be on the network, but you get no say in what happens to it"". 

I have a big problem with that. It is possible that it wont be an issue in the future, but that is a looooong way a way.

Again though, none of this information you gave me is new to me. I just pull a different perspective, which is healthy. We need diverse perspectives in the future of Bitcoin. That's what open source projects are all about. 

But you don't address my initial question. 

What do you feel are the important points behind bitcoin? Is decentalization the most important aspect? Is it scarcity? Is it censorship resistance? Is it consensus? Is it p2p?",1526326094

"The question is as follows, don't mind my subpar translating skills.

Bitcoin is a digital currency that only exists online. It has existed since January 1st 2009 and can be used as payment method in webstores and for other online services. Bitcoin is not, like standard money, made by a central bank. Instead, all bitcoin that exist are created by having computers participate in solving specific mathematical problems. This works as follows: everyone can run special software on his or her computer that participates in solving such a mathematical problem. The owner of the computer that solves the problem receives 25 (newly created) bitcoin as a reward. Because it was the case that in 2014 such a problem is solved every 10 minutes, 25 new bitcoins were created every 10 minutes. 
On January 1st there were (approximately) 12.2 million bitcoin. 

Question a. 
Assuming the above, calculate in what year the amount of bitcoin exceeded 18 million, given that the speed at which they are introduced does not change. 

Solution:
Each day there are 60/10*24*25 = 3600 bitcoin to be earned. Given that there is 18-12.2 = 5.8 million bitcoin left to be earned, that's 5.8*10^6/3600 = 1611 days, bringing us from 2014 to 2018. 

In reality the rate at which bitcoin are introduced does not stay equal to 25 bitcoins every 10 minutes. This rate reduces. During the first four years, from January 2009 to January 2013, the reward was equal to 50 bitcoin. The reward gets reduced by half every four years: from January 1st 2013 to January 1st 2017 the reward is 25 bitcoin, for the next four years it is 12.5, and so forth.

Question b: calculate from which year on the reward will be less than one bitcoin. 

Solution: the amount of bitcoin y given as a reward is given by y = 50*0.5^x where x is the amount of 4 year periods that have passed since January 1st 2009 (the first period is given by x = 0). So we need to solve 50*0.5^x = 1. In Mathematics A you're allowed to solve this directly with your calculator, else just divide by 50 and take the log. This gives that x = 5.6, so it will be after 6 periods. 6*4 + 2009 = 2033.

The total amount of bitcoin that can be put into circulation is limited. This is partially due to the reward halving every four years. The amount of bitcoin that is currently in circulation can be approximated by the following equation:
C = 21 - 21*0.5^(0.25*t)
Here C is the amount of bitcoin in millions and t equals the amount of years with January first 2009 given by t = 0. 

Question c: Determine the maximal amount of bitcoin that can be in circulation based on the above equation based on reasoning.

Solution: 0.5^(0.25*t) goes to 0 for large t, so that C = 21 - 21*0 for large t. The limit is therefore 21 million bitcoin.

To regulate the total amount of bitcoin in circulation, not only the number of bitcoin rewarded per solution is reduced, but the difficulty of the mathematical problems being solved is also increased. That is because more and more people use their computer to solve the problems. The difficulty of the problems being solved scales exponentially according to the equation

D = 3.65 * e^(0.533t)

Here D is the difficulty of solving the problem and t is the time in months, with T = 0 on January 1st 2013. Larger D implies that the problem is harder to solve.

Problem D:
Write down the equation for the derivative of D and argue that D is an increasing function, that increases by an increasing rate. 

Solution:
The derivative is 0.533*3.65 * e^(0.533t) by virtue of how the derivative of e^x works plus the so called chain rule; if f(x) = e^x then f'(x) is e^x, and if g(x) = e^(h(x)) then g'(x) = h'(x)*e^(h(x)). Now, e^(0.533*t) is a positive number for t larger or equal to 0 so the derivative is positive and D is an increasing function, and e^(0.533*t2) &gt; e^(0.533*t1) for t2 &gt; t1 so that the derivative grows with time, leading to an increasing rate at which D increases.

The above formula for D can be rewritten in such a way that you can find the amount of months needed to reach a specific D.

Question E:
Rewrite the above equation for D in such a way.

Solution: 
D = 3.65 * e^(0.533t), taking the log (= base e logarithm, they call it ln in Dutch high school math but I dont believe this is universally true) on both sides we get that log(D) = Log(3.65*e^0.533t) = Log(3.65) + Log(e^0.533t) = Log(3.65) + 0.533t*Log(e) = Log(3.65) + 0.533t so that we can write down that t = Log(D/3.65)/0.533 using the rules of the Log function (Log(x*y) = Log(x) + Log(y), Log(x^y) = y*log(x))",1526326013

"You ask some good questions, and make some perfectly valid points, unfortunately it's hard to answer them in these kinds of settings without people taking stuff out of context, brigading, or just trying to drown out opinions with noise.

The reason you're able to ask this kind of question is pretty much the only reason I frequent this sub, I don't believe that topics should be removed from the discussion, but I understand why your post would be (and was) removed on r/bitcoin, they consider these sorts of discussion ""off topic"" and remove them all (rightly or wrongly, it depends a lot on your opinion how you feel about that).

I think the answer to your main question about ""the scaling debate"" boils down: _nobody really knows_.  

The ""small blocker"" camp (treated like an insult in this sub FYI):  
There are some people saying that on-chain scaling will not be suitable for PayPal/Visa sized levels of use, personally, I agree with this, there has to be a level of off chain usage, for example the high frequency trades you see on exchanges, it would be impossible to do this on chain, I think we can agree on that?  What happens when that sort of scale is potentially happening through real world usage?  We don't _know_ what happens when every 10 minutes a 500mb block is made, if you ask many round here, they will tell you that it's fine as they all seem to have gigabit connections, but I mean at a miner level, how will it impact miners that aren't in the block finding pool?  Can the block finding pool do something that slows down other miners enough that they accept a block as found, and start mining an empty block, do we end up with large numbers of empty or invalid blocks due to block propagation times?  It could become an arms race, one that only the big established players can compete in, is that good? Is it bad?  

My personal opinion is big blocks would simple kick the can down the road, Ethereum is already having their own ""scaling debate"", and even a ""mining debate"", we can see the rise in requirements for running ETH nodes, and we can see fractures starting to appear (many will tell you that they can sync a new node, but the reality is they just download and accept as truth what's gone before, it's not true validation).

The ""big blocker"" camp (most round here):  
Often you hear people talking as if everything should be on-chain, tips on the internet, payments to your friends, purchases in shops, and the solution is simply to allow blocks to get bigger before hitting the limit.  That's it in a nutshell, some new plans regarding propagation/validation etc have been thrown round, we have to wait to see how that pans out.  (Ironically I see you had a tip from the local tip bot, which is amusingly an off chain custodial solution, most of these have died out over the years, including the famous dogetipbot which had it's funds drained to pay for the owners business expenses!)

Fundamentally many of us that don't ""believe"" in bitcoin cash, are simply turned off by all the ""bitcoin cash is bitcoin"" bullshit, it's (IMO) damaging to the whole ecosystem, and confusing to people that don't understand, or are new to the whole debate.  Many people had coins from the fork, and are just keeping quiet, or not caring.  If bitcoin cash went it's way, and did it's own thing, I think many would actually be fine with it (like bitcoin gold/private etc), the barrage of rhetoric is (quite frankly) nauseating, obvious, and massively offputting.  I'm quite tired of the tarring and feathering of the devs, conspiracy theories are treated as fact (AXA/Bilderberg), constant FUD about what bitcoin is doing (or what it did), which goes round in cycles, and I think there's a lot more going on behind the scenes than we notice, both sides have their idiots, and both sides have people that believe in what they do, it's cutting the crap out that's hard.

Everyone will have an opinion, but I think most people fall foul of the bike shed problem, people don't (as a whole) understand the actual workings of the network, they have enough information to make poor decisions, often based on gut feelings, or will allow themselves to be lead by particular leaders they admire.  Following a leader isn't a bad idea, _if_ you trust them, and _if_ they are trustworthy enough (how do you tell?).  But when your ""leaders"" decide to post articles about how Blockstream are patenting SegWit (everyone cries, but it's fake news, and never happened, but interestingly when someone else tries to get patents put into bitcoin cash, that's awesome!), then posts articles on how LN is ""mathematically impossible"" (but then was proven wrong), and then start campaigns about LN needing KYC... 

One thing I can say though is I don't believe bitcoin should be designed, and important decisions based on the court of popular opinions, I would guess most people involved have _some_ idea if you start trying to explain block sizes to them, but is that enough?  Does that persons opinion suddenly matter?  They can now understand enough to vote on a twitter poll, but should that sort of poll be used to in any way influence the direction of bitcoin (or bitcoin cash)?",1526325840

&gt; My opinion matters little as I don't know the technical details.

Never ever say this, this is something that core devs promote, that Bitcoin is soooooo complex that only the devs understand it or some other bullshit. Open the whitepaper and see how many lines of code it has. Everyones opinion matters in Bitcoin, and I would argue the users opinion matters the most, since this shit is for users, not for devs. You don't need to know any coding or any cryptography to understand bitcoin's value proposition, which is the only thing matters.

&gt; The centralisation of nodes with bigger blocks

Many people will tell you here that non mining nodes do not matter, I think the opposite, they do matter. But how much? Do we need every single user to run a non mining node, as u/luke-jr says? Even if we do need it, is that even possible?

No. We need non mining nodes to ensure that we would know if miners were screwing us. However, we need only a very miniscule percentage of users to run non mining i.e. idle nodes to ensure that. Why? Because there is no different between 50k idle nodes and 50 million idle nodes, if the goal is to ensure miners stay honest with the users, since it's equally impossible to corrupt 50k nodes or to 50 million nodes. We need the ledger to be fairly distributed to ensure that, but after a point, there's no point to distribute it further, since noone can alter it without anybody noticing.

&gt; Miner incentives as the block rewards keep halving

After block rewards are gone, we are gonna need a fee market. How do we ensure a fee market? I'll give you two approaches:

1) Make sure that we scale to hundreds of millions of users, so that each paying subcent fees would make sure that we have 1) happy users, 2) happy miners

2) Artificially restrict the blocksize so that BTC is restricted to a niche usecase, can at best have a few million users who may or may not continue to pay hundreds of dollars in fees.",1526325280

"The issue is not with lending---I have no issue with lending, so don't go down that rabbit hole. It is an interesting topic, but not the point here. The point here is that structurally, fiat currency depends on lending, which makes it fundamentally vulnerable, whereas crypto depends does not.

Fiat money is, quite simply, the debt of banks. That is to say, all fiat money in existence represents the liabilities of some bank. Those liabilities must be balanced with assets lest the bank become insolvent, and since banks cannot legally print money for any other purpose than to lend, those assets that keep banks solvent are fundamentally the debt of borrowers. Since without banks fiat money simply would not exist, if banks collectively became insolvent, fiat money would collapse entirely.

The money itself, in other words, is dependent on debt being repaid. If for any reason there were a massive collection of defaults, the monetary system would be in danger. 

Furthermore, the system is simultaneously dependent on the existence of debt because without debt there would be no money. If everyone paid off their debts without an equal amount of new loans being issued, the system would collapse as there would cease to be any money in circulation. 

So the fiat monetary system is fundamentally dependent on lending because lending is how money is created. This means this money is intrinsically vulnerable for the same reasons debt is vulnerable.

"Firstly, the idea that Satoshi can't ever change his mind about anything is beyond comprehension. 

I stated what I feel is important for Bitcoin to be. 
I am interested in what makes Bitcoin important to the rBTC community. If it is only because Satoshi said x y and z, then you haven't developed your own opinion about it. 

I am absolutely fine with you disagreeing with me. 

I am even fine with people lying to me about what they claim Bitcoin to be.

What is to say that you haven't been lied to? You have to take the information given to you and make your own decisions. 

I am an adult, I have read the white paper. I have gone through the internet archives and read a lot of what Satoshi has said. I have developed my own opinions based on what I know. And here I am, expanding what I know by trying to have civil discourse with people. 

But the truth is, Satoshi isn't around anymore, so I don't feel that we can use his opinion anymore. My opinion has changed so much in the past 8 years about all sorts of information. 

It's very easy for someone to say what a missing persons opinion would be when they aren't here to say otherwise. What would happen if Satoshi reappeared one day and claimed that BitcoinCash is all wrong? Would you still follow him? The whole point of open-source if that the original leader isn't the be all and end all. 

There are all sorts of bottlenecks where centralization can exist. But we have to do our best to try and not let that happen. Open source projects are not easy. They are slow and clunky, but necessary for something like bitcoin.

Anyway there was a guy on here who said we became a millionaire in a year off of an initial 3K purchase of XRP so it's possible to hit that mark with relatively little money. If want to hit it big in the next year and can only put down 10k or less then you might want to skip the big coins like BTC, LTC, and ETH although they will all make you money in the long run. Look at small market cap projects that have solid project and are still down from the crash this year. Coins like KIN, COSS, and MANA are my favorite right now in that area.

"&gt;No, the Bitcoin DAA only consider the past 2000 blocks window for its calculation and the precedente 2000 blocks to check the difficulty didn’t drop below some threshold.
&gt;
&gt;And that it, there could be no block or a million before those 4000 ones, it would make not difference for the DAA.

An adjustment requires an initial value from which to adjust. In the case of DAA, the validity of that starting value is dependent on the state prior to its adjustment. This chain of dependency goes all the way back to the genesis. The entirety of the blockchain determines the present difficulty target and therefore influences the DAA.

One one only needs to observe the latest block header to mine a new block, but its validity is dependent on the complete history of the chain. So to can the difficulty adjustment be calculated using only the present difficulty and the absolute duration of the last difficulty period, and its validity is no less dependent on the complete chain.

&gt;I don’t overlook it.

The genesis of this comment chain was my assertion that it is intellectually dishonest to exclude mention of the changes BCH has made to the difficulty schedule. If this does not apply to you, fantastic! I am more than willing to entertain any reasonable argument for why or how any property of bitcoin can, should or must be modified, or why such properties should remain immutable. What I cannot abide is an attempt to conceal those changes when they have occurred.

&gt;Like chinese banning bitcoin mining and difficulty drop permanently 80%?
&gt;
&gt;That would mean at least three to four month to recover while BCH will have recovered in few days.

If 80% of the work capacity were to suddenly drop, that would indicate an incredibly high probability that such capacity is available to attack the chain. BTC would adjust slowly and, while still vulnerable to the absent majority, would remain expensive to attack for a longer period. BCH would adjust more rapidly and thus be _more vulnerable_ to manipulation (censorship, double-spending) by the hostile capacity. The rapid difficulty reduction would act as a multiplier for the attacker's work capacity.",1526323225

"&gt;-multi-layer settlement networks are how every other financial network have worked, well, since double-entry accounting. 

Hence why Satoshi's invention is so revolutionary.

&gt; then not thinking of scaling, 

He pretty explicitly thought about scaling.
https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/2/#selection-81.8-14.66

&gt;and not realizing layered-settlement was a possible solution even if he liked it as a solution or not, seems to be a large oversight on his part. 

Well, *obviously* people are free to create Bitcoin-denominated credit and banking networks on top of the blockchain. So suggesting a possible oversight on Satoshi's part here seems strange.  Furthermore, Satoshi did seem to think that second layers (i.e., an ""aggregating mechanism"") would be necessary if you wanted to do ""arbitrarily small micropayments."":

&gt;Bitcoin isn't currently practical for very small micropayments. Not for things like pay per search or per page view without an aggregating mechanism, not things needing to pay less than 0.01. The dust spam limit is a first try at intentionally trying to prevent overly small micropayments like that. Bitcoin is practical for smaller transactions than are practical with existing payment methods. Small enough to include what you might call the top of the micropayment range. But it doesn't claim to be practical for arbitrarily small micropayments. ",1526323024
"&gt; If there is so much demand and excitement, how come volume is down from this time last year?

You are comparing this year to one of the greatest bull runs in crypto history, that's why. You are very short sighted, imo, and that alone puts you at a disadvantage for understanding why.

&gt; If there is so much excitement, how come the price sits at $12k off its ath?

Most people understood that the ATH of $20k in that short amount of time was not a ""healthy rise"" for any market and that there would likely be a serious correction afterwards. Then, of course, we saw a serious alt-coin explosion in the following month. Expecting that entire process to repeat itself 3 months later is ignorant at best, and once again shows a lack of understanding of how this market works. Maybe you should stick to more traditional markets where extreme volatility is less of a factor?

Nonetheless, what we see today is a more sensible rise and correction, along with a fare amount of accumulation periods. This is exactly what I believe will be necessary to start the next bull cycle, but we also need a catalyst, which I believe may come in the form of a Bitcoin ETF, along with more mainstream companies (such as Telegram, Google, etc) getting involved in the near future. Once again, if you paid more attention to institutional investing and OTC markets, you would see a different story than the ""doom and gloom"" scenario that you continuously pontificate.

&gt; If there is so much excitement, why did price cross below the 50/200 SMA this year for the first time since the price was below $1k?

When you have the greatest bull run in crypto history, guess what? That also means you'll see the greatest correction in crypto history. Basic crypto investing 101. There is no way that Bitcoin could sustain such price movement; so yes, falling below any x-day moving average is not too baffling at all.

&gt; Prediction: BTC will see $6500 before it sees $9500 again. take that to the bank

This is just arrogance at its peak now.

I do follow some T.A. and respect a lot of people in that field, but neither they, nor myslef, claim to know what Bitcoin's price will be tomorrow, let alone 6 months from now. This market is exceedingly speculative and driven by unusual circumstances. Not very many T.A. guys looked at their charts in April 2017 and said BTC would be $20k in December. lol Telling us it will go to $6500, before it goes to $9500 requires little expertise in the field. Many say it will go to $5k. Great. My concern is ""Will the value of BTC be much higher by the end of 2018 than it is today?"" I say, the probability of that is extremely high, based on what I'm hearing and seeing in the background.

You can continue to argue $6500 vs $9500 next month if you like.",1526323023

this *factually* is not true. since centralization comes from who can edit the blockchain and that is only miners ipso facto only miners contribute to decentralization

however, i feel that the segwit proponents have been particularly inflexible, with ethically-questionable methods of implementing it (UASF, followed by the abandonment of SW2X/NYA/HKA), whereas bigblockers have been required to hardfork, a process that explicitely requires mathematical consensus.

as it turned out, SW was implemented as a result of SW2X, but the 2MB increase was then abandoned as a result of ""NO2X"" - essentially showing that SW2X was a covert attempt (as least by some users/miners) to activate segwit with no intention to implement 2x later.

"Hi OP, as someone who learned all about bitcoin years ago and tried to get friends and companies to use bitcoin years ago I have to tell you that the Bitcoin I joined it BCH and not BTC. 

I read the bitcoin whitepaper and liked the idea of decentralized p2p e-cash that no one can censor, and that's why today I still like bitcoin (cash).

let's talk about your points.

1) decentralization what is it and how does bch achieve it?
Decentralization is one of Bitcoin's main selling points. But what does it actually mean? Skip to the end for the tl;dr

**What is centralization**    
As we all know from reading everything Satoshi wrote about his design for Bitcoin from satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org, Bitcoin was finalized and born in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. In this event many normal people lost money while banking executives made more and more. 

**Where does centralization come from**       
These banks, much like the bank you probably use today, are centralized. That is, they alone control everything that happens. There is one database which has everyone's funds, if they decide you are a terrorist or something they can stop you from access your money. They can stop you from making transactions. Even if you have done nothing wrong they can stop payment on your transactions without your consent, lock you out of your funds, and monitor everything you do. 


**What  is decentralization**       
By splitting up the 'power' that a bank has we decentralize it. There is no longer any one single entity that can control txs and funds. This way no one is 'in charge' and no one can give themselves bonuses while other people lose money. This decentralization is a founding point of Bitcoin.

**Where does decentralization come from**       
Instead of one company controlling the database of funds like in the centralized model, in Bitcoin's decentralized model there are many people who can all contribute to the database and transaction processing without any one entity having full control. In Bitcoin and other POW based cryptocurrencies this decentralization is achieved by having a number of *mining nodes* who are not affiliated. As long as no group of miners controls more than 51% of the hashpower, bitcoin remains decentralized.

---


**So only mining nodes contribute to decentralization, then what about non-mining nodes**      
Non-mining nodes, full nodes, relay nodes, or storage nodes are often misunderstood to be part of decentralization. This can be easily cleared up by understanding the above information and then understanding that a non-mining node has no *power* if the majority of hashpower were to do something they didn't like. 

**I thought everyone was supposed to run a full node**      
This is another common misunderstanding, in the very beginning Satoshi did intend for everyone to run a node with 4 functions. He is very clear when he explains how this is not the way for the system to function in the future. The plan of bitcoin is that everyone can make trustless peer-to-peer transactions on a decentralized system. Not that everyone would run a home server with the whole blockchain. The business and bitcoin companies that need to have personal and instant validation of their tx can run a full nodes. Random sampling is a tried and trusted method, those unable to host their own relay node would be easily able to verify their transactions with overwhelming mathematically certainty.

**So who wants to run a full node then**     
Anyone who wants to can, it's like the Olympics, 'anyone can compete but few feel the need to'. There is no reason the network should be ground to a halt and made useless so people who can't afford to make a transaction would be able to run a full node on a 20 year old computer over a dial up connection. Bitcoin was meant to scale with technology, not become left behind. 


**What are the 4 functions that all early nodes did**       
When you read the design of Bitcoin which we all invested into, the design on which so much was built, the one at nakamotoinstitute.org, you see Satoshi mention the word 'node' many times. What we today call a full node or non-mining node usually fulfills one of those functions, that of storing the database. Finding other peers for connecting to is done by full nodes and pool operators. Sending and receiving bitcoin, aka a wallet, was also a function every node had. Finally generating coins by putting new transactions into the blockchain was the 4th thing all nodes used to do. Today these 4 actions are largely compartmentalized, as they should be in any good computer science project.

---


This is Bitcoin, some people are unhappy with the way Bitcoin was designed, well I suppose Bitcoin is simply not for those people and they should maybe find something else to do.


I hope you've all learned something today about how Bitcoin is decentralized, what is means, and how we got there.

tl;dr Banks control all txs and accounts with one database and are centralized, Bitcoin has many miners who perform this actions to make it decentralized. Non-mining nodes don't contribute to decentralization. 

---

*BTC seems to favor non mining nodes for decentralization when in FACT they do nothing to help that, since BTC is misleading it's users I have to credit **BCH wins this point***

2) bch and btc are from the same stock, so they have the same scaricty

**BCH and BTC tie here**

3) censorship resitance.

this means that you can make a tx and no one can censor it

that means that you want a p2p system, where you make a tx and the system processes it. any system with middlemen enables censorship where it didn't exist before. So forceing people to use a LN or other middleman is against the premise of bitcoin

**BTC loses here** 

4)

this means everyone on earth should be able to use it, so it should have zero barriars to use which mean no one is forced to run a non mining node, no one is forced to wait longer than one block, and the transactions should be as close to free as possible.

bch aciheves this totally, btc not so much

**BCH wins this point**

5)
this means that everyone should be able to get some, but getting bitcoin is difficult right now for almost everyone so **both bch and btc lose this point**


so OP, looking back on the bitocin I spend so many months learning about and envalgalizing I have to say it is still Bitcoin but it is now called bitcoin cash, it works the same way it always did, a decentralized p2p ecash for everyone on earth

**BTC is simply not a p2p ecash that everyone on earth can use** and with the forced addition of segregated witness via lies I can't in good concionce consider btc a worthy contender for the name of bitcoin.",1526322111

There is also chaintip, which works somewhat similarly, except the tip is deposited via PM and notice sent to the recipient.  If they don't claim it, it will return to the sender after a week or so.  This is done with multisig transactions and is on-chain.

We used to have these on BTC, but the fees got prohibitive.

Another innovation on BCH is Yours.org, which allows you to write articles and get paid for them in BCH.  When you sign up, a wallet is created for you (you get the seed words) and you can fund it with BCH, then buy, tip, vote, or comment on any article on the Yours.org platform.  Ryan Charles was trying to make this work on BTC, but the unpredictable fees made it unusable.

Most big block proponents understand that layer 2 solutions are needed.  We just did not want to force everyone to use them because of the on-chain fees.  A modest blocksize increase would have bought time for LN to grow and mature.  Now, it is under pressure to work immediately, which is not fair to the project or the users.

We believe Bitcoin Cash should be usable by everyone, even those earning $2 a day (or $2 a month in Venezuela).  High transaction fees should not ever be a barrier to entry.

Folks in Venezuela have started the EatBCH fund, and started because of a $5 BCH tip (on tippr), which fed dozens of people.",1526322078
"Great article but I think national cryptos can just be added to the list of other shit coins that people won't want. People in Venezuela are already proving they dont want it and would prefer bitcoin or other crypto for transactions.  We already primarily use national digital currencies, adding ""Crypto"" to it doesn't give it anymore value, its just changes the name of something that is still a centralized, highly controlled and monitored currency.  By the time governments start making their own currencies, bitcoin and the other legit alt coins will have taken hold, there will be no demand for national crypto and no one will want or need use it. I believe people will always gravitate towards permission less, open technologies like bitcoin, and other REAL cryptocurrencies. The only way I can see national crypto taking hold is if your government mandates that you MUST use national crypto otherwise face legal action, however in that case, your country has made it fairly clear they don't value individual freedom.",1526322072
"If the Segwit2x ""compromise"" had broad majority support from across the Bitcoin community then it would have gone into effect.... regardless of what the ""goons"" wanted. Miners, developers, commercial companies, etc. all saw that segwit2x was going to become a minority fork and the main chain would live on and remain dominant.

I'm not sure how you expect this to work? Get broad support and what you want to happen will. BCH supporters are currently hiring themselves by promoting their coin with a misleading social media campaign and making false claims like ""Bitcoin has failed"", ""Segwit is cancer"" (huh?), ""BCH will take all the hash power and market value from BTC within 6 months"", etc. And yet users, developers, miners, Bitcoin companies, etc. remain committed to Bitcoin and haven't moved to BCH.",1526322028

"It goes into the whole Block-size debate. 
I am on the side that the blocks need to be as small as they can be. A blockchain is a slow and inefficient way to deal with data, but necessary for trustlessness and security. 

I think that larger blocks increase the gateway to run your own node (which I do) and increase the decentralization. As does the increase in price for transactions.

I don't think that Bitcoin is ready for the masses yet, and I don't think it will be without second and maybe even third layer solutions. 
I have looked into a lot of the discussions for both. But I personally look at Bitcoin as a robust system that other systems can be built upon. A way to build a whole market of sidechains and 2nd layers where the best will survive. 

If after other solutions are explored properly and it is still needed to increase the block size, then I am all for it. But I think it needs to be done as a last resort. Given that I can get my transactions in for 1 satoshi per byte in an hour, and that I am using the lightning network too, I don't feel that it is necessary yet. 

I will also mention that I think the whole no2x thing was rather stupid. And it created more infighting than it needed. I am not opposed to block size increases, but I believe that consensus is more important to the open source project. I think the strong stance probably came from a ""if we fold on this, then where will it stop?"". ",1526322007

How in the fuck could I be wrong about them altering my transaction history, when they altered my transaction history?  I'm not making that up, or stating my 'opinion'.  I'm stating FACT, dummy.

Maybe about their motives, but certainly not about the alterations or the FACT that they held my coins, about .33 BTC, for 60 days during the peak of the price.  It was a few thousand dollars at the time.  I really shouldn't expect a child like you, with only a couple thousand Doge to understand.  

Speaking about the 'real world' people in the real world have bills.  Guess what?  I pay my bills with crypto.  Not having access to a few thousand dollars hurts.  Once you move out of your parents and grow up a bit, I'm sure you'll understand.  In the meantime, stay in school.  ",1526321764

A business says that the product must work today - and tomorrow. The gate-keepers willfully prevented Bitcoin from working the way it had. By letting it become expensive and unreliable they damaged the reputation of BTC. They showed the world that BTC was not ready for prime time. That it wasn't all it had claimed to be.

-If Satoshi convincingly thought of and/or solved nearly every possible Bitcoin setback (see near total lack of early critical errors more or less, ability to answer question after question about the theoretical concepts in those early emails), then not thinking of scaling, and not realizing layered-settlement was a possible solution even if he liked it as a solution or not, seems to be a large oversight on his part.

Then why mention the Alexa ranking of Coinmarketcap at the very beginning of an article that had absolute zero to do with its popularity? Right, to make them, and by extension their decisions, seem as legitimate as possible.

Same bias problem as the previous sentence.

&gt;Bitcoin.com run by Roger Ver has been accused...

So he hasn't been sued. no attorney has officially filed anything thus far, but the accusation alone is enough to imply guilt.

.Roger Ver came under fire recently for Bitcoin.com's labelling of BCH as Bitcoin and BTC as Bitcoin Core, which along with a long-standing pro-BCH narrative caused many to view the labelling as a deliberate action as opposed to an unintentional error, leading to the website to be reported to the FBI for fraud.

I could report you for fraud to the FBI right now. See: fbi.gov

&gt;BCH advocates larger block sizes for faster transactions which critics say may put more power in the hands of the few, like Ver himself...

Oh, you mean that guy who dedicated his entire life to helping bitcoin become a success on the scale of which you couldn't even imagine?

Every article in this garbage is biased as humanly possible. Please link me to all of those articles where you wrote about bitcoiners being completely unable to donate funds towards poor people and starving families around the world during late-2018 (among several other periods of time) because Blockstream founders crusaded for higher on-chain fees while popping champagne. I'm sure there are many such pieces by the likes of you. /s

Banks raped the country’s most vulnerable senior citizens and minorities in multiple ways in 2008 and those ppl are still without the pension instruments those banks sold them and the houses they foreclosed on - only to sell again once the people were kicked out. There’s nothing honorable about banks with or without crypto. The government bought their bad debt and they said screw the people and liquidated what people owned only to give their execs bonuses. And banks don’t create credit funds the federal reserve does and then banks are allowed to fractional reserve lend money on top of that they don’t even have and foreclose on real assets when ppl don’t pay them. You don’t need crypto to hate banks. Are u being sarcastic?,1526320082

"Lols, what u are taking about is using mathematical models trying to predict an outcome...

First of all, no politician would push for a deflatianory economy cos it doesn't benefit them... why would u want a restricted money supply if need money for funding and some (maybe more) for ur pocket... its a lot better to print money now, hide the value, and let the next batch deal with the problems u created...

I agree that it won't make a nation competitve as every nation is taking debts for growth... its just like taking a business loan for expansion...

It fuels growth,but it comes with a risk.. a risk that not politicians is going to pay for, but the everyday citizen... btw, the politicians and bankers are getting a heads up and already stashed their money safely...

And two, its good that bitcoin isn't a country or nation, which means it has no directive to stay competitive... it becomes an option for people who doesn't want to become a participant of the games played by central banks.. 

I do believe that bitcoin and fiat will co-exist in the future... bitcoin is just the balancing element that naturally polices central banks from abusing their powers... 

The way I see it, a nicely managed fiat can outperform bitcoin (cos it will eventually flat)... but abuse ur lead, and people now have the option of leaving ur fiat... ",1526320039

Bitcoin Cash is a valiant attempt to get Bitcoin back on the rails and moving forward, but I think it's too little, too late.  Why would I use use a coin where I have to pay a fee and wait for confirmations when I can use something like Nano which is free and instantly confirmed?

---


Decentralization is one of Bitcoin's main selling points. But what does it actually mean? Skip to the end for the tl;dr
What is centralization
As we all know from reading everything Satoshi wrote about his design for Bitcoin from satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org, Bitcoin was finalized and born in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. In this event many normal people lost money while banking executives made more and more.
Where does centralization come from
These banks, much like the bank you probably use today, are centralized. That is, they alone control everything that happens. There is one database which has everyone's funds, if they decide you are a terrorist or something they can stop you from access your money. They can stop you from making transactions. Even if you have done nothing wrong they can stop payment on your transactions without your consent, lock you out of your funds, and monitor everything you do.
What is decentralization
By splitting up the 'power' that a bank has we decentralize it. There is no longer any one single entity that can control txs and funds. This way no one is 'in charge' and no one can give themselves bonuses while other people lose money. This decentralization is a founding point of Bitcoin.
Where does decentralization come from
Instead of one company controlling the database of funds like in the centralized model, in Bitcoin's decentralized model there are many people who can all contribute to the database and transaction processing without any one entity having full control. In Bitcoin and other POW based cryptocurrencies this decentralization is achieved by having a number of mining nodes who are not affiliated. As long as no group of miners controls more than 51% of the hashpower, bitcoin remains decentralized.
So only mining nodes contribute to decentralization, then what about non-mining nodes
Non-mining nodes, full nodes, relay nodes, or storage nodes are often misunderstood to be part of decentralization. This can be easily cleared up by understanding the above information and then understanding that a non-mining node has no power if the majority of hashpower were to do something they didn't like.
I thought everyone was supposed to run a full node
This is another common misunderstanding, in the very beginning Satoshi did intend for everyone to run a node with 4 functions. He is very clear when he explains how this is not the way for the system to function in the future. The plan of bitcoin is that everyone can make trustless peer-to-peer transactions on a decentralized system. Not that everyone would run a home server with the whole blockchain. The business and bitcoin companies that need to have personal and instant validation of their tx can run a full nodes. Random sampling is a tried and trusted method, those unable to host their own relay node would be easily able to verify their transactions with overwhelming mathematically certainty.
So who wants to run a full node then
Anyone who wants to can, it's like the Olympics, 'anyone can compete but few feel the need to'. There is no reason the network should be ground to a halt and made useless so people who can't afford to make a transaction would be able to run a full node on a 20 year old computer over a dial up connection. Bitcoin was meant to scale with technology, not become left behind.
What are the 4 functions that all early nodes did
When you read the design of Bitcoin which we all invested into, the design on which so much was built, the one at nakamotoinstitute.org, you see Satoshi mention the word 'node' many times. What we today call a full node or non-mining node usually fulfills one of those functions, that of storing the database. Finding other peers for connecting to is done by full nodes and pool operators. Sending and receiving bitcoin, aka a wallet, was also a function every node had. Finally generating coins by putting new transactions into the blockchain was the 4th thing all nodes used to do. Today these 4 actions are largely compartmentalized, as they should be in any good computer science project.
This is Bitcoin, some people are unhappy with the way Bitcoin was designed, well I suppose Bitcoin is simply not for those people and they should maybe find something else to do.
I hope you've all learned something today about how Bitcoin is decentralized, what is means, and how we got there.
tl;dr Banks control all txs and accounts with one database and are centralized, Bitcoin has many miners who perform this actions to make it decentralized. Non-mining nodes don't contribute to decentralization.",1526318775

I've been interested in and engaged in the exploration of cryptocurrency (in some capacity) since before the invention of bitcoin.,1526318587
"&gt; If you ask someone to send you some Bitcoin, then that is Bitcoin, therefore Bitcoin is BTC.

Virtually all of my friends who are interested in *using* cryptocurrency and not just ""hodling"" and speculating have switched to using BCH as our functional form of money. We say ""I'll pay you in Bitcoin"" and mean BCH. Language and names for things are not universal. Is this thing 🍆an eggplant or an aubergine? Can it not be both depending on what different groups of people call it?

&gt;use case for everyday purchases is not improved over my debit card at present.

Using Bitcoin for me is a deliberate philosophical exercise. I try to use it as much as possible and I go out of my way to patronize businesses that accept it. In Tokyo we have over 40 businesses accepting BCH now, despite there being no merchant processor that supports BCH here, meaning these are business owners directly receiving payment to their phone and holding on to it. This is because of the large and passionate community we have going here. 

Fun fact: the first thing I ever purchased with Bitcoin was a cup of coffee in early 2013, while living in Beijing. This was the first known retail bitcoin transaction in China and was reported on by CCTV China's first MSM coverage of Bitcoin. We aren't a community of altcoiners trying to dethrone BTC with our own coin... I've been around in this space for a long time and I genuinely hold the belief that BCH is Bitcoin as I was using it five years ago. 

&gt;What is this tipper thing I keep seeing?

Tipping bots used to exist for BTC, but that possibility was killed by high fees, along with pretty much every other cool use case of p2p digital cash. The ability to send money to another person through a Reddit comment without needing to know anything about you is a perfect example of the kinds of awesome innovation that was happening in Bitcoin for years and was killed off by Bitcoin Core's intentional stagnation. Now we are working hard to rebuild infrastructure like this on top of BCH.  ",1526318587

"**Quantitative easing**

Quantitative easing (QE), also known as large-scale asset purchases, is an expansionary monetary policy whereby a central bank buys predetermined amounts of government bonds or other financial assets in order to stimulate the economy and increase liquidity. An unconventional form of monetary policy, it is usually used when standard monetary policy has become ineffective at combating too low inflation or deflation. A central bank implements quantitative easing by buying specified amounts of financial assets from commercial banks and other financial institutions, thus raising the prices of those financial assets and lowering their yield, while simultaneously increasing the money supply. This differs from the more usual policy of buying or selling short-term government bonds to keep interbank interest rates at a specified target value.

You see what I'm saying? Maybe, it's somewhat related to the kind of people they want to attend, people with ... money.

"&gt;even save them from a financial crisis

I assume this refers to ease of liquidity to get toxic shit off their books in the event they have to do so expediently and also better ID ownership via fast settlements \(if assets become crypto\-assets\), and also receive quick injects of liquidity. Generally, both would have helped '08. But if they keep securitizing bad debt, tranching it, and creating incredibly complex derivatives \(CDOs are still around folks\), then they'll keep getting into trouble.

Basically 100&amp;#37;. It's the store of value crypto wants to be, so even if crypto takes gold over, it would only fill a market cap of $4T total. 

Comparing two market caps is still comparing apples to apples, because even if you don't like using the metric of market cap, I am directly comparing it to ANOTHER market cap, same metric.

The only other way value can be ""created"" is through devaluation of FIAT, which if we do expect for both to co\-exist, I wouldn't expect for much pullback in the buying power of FIAT. 

I guess I could be wrong, but it just seems improbable that the aggregate market cap will be anything more than $10\-15 Trillion, if it disrupts all adjacent markets and gains total market adoption \(20\-30x total market cap\) ",1526318230

They’re using payment channels it’s not owned by bitcoin. Plus he said he wanted to short bitcoin not cryptocurrency,1526318219
"So to paraphrase...

Some unrelated gold mining company out of africa is going to have a bot predicting whether they go up or down. \~That's fine. Then if the bot does great and gets an awesome prediction streak going, the bot's predictions will be given more weight. \~That's sensible, but shaky. I will roll with it. Then, anyone who owns cryptocurrencies can redeem the future forecasts for their own cryptocurrencies using the same algorithm as the one that predicted the gold market...\~Wait wut?

My response\-1. Correlation is not causation, and there is ample argument for gold and crypto to correlate and negatively correlate. For example, goldbugs could be selling gold to buy bitcoin \(I know I have\). Normal folks could be selling shares to buy gold and bitcoin. Or people could be selling shares to buy ONLY bitcoin. The prediction market should be based on pure crypto, not on an unrelated second asset class. 

2. Prediction and trader bots are great, and are excellent at front running, and making profits on small market swings, etc. However, unless your trading with a bot yourself, getting predictions from a bot really does nothing for strategy. 

3. Bitcoin derives value from people. Houses derive value from people. Gold derives value from people. Fiat derives value from government, which derives authority from people. Shares derive value from corporations, which are influenced by government and derive value from people. Bitcoin doesn't need to be backed by anything. Bitcoin has the same backing level as the united states government, perhaps more so because the us government is gerrymandered, and controlled by banks and corps. Bitcoin is the most real thing there is. ",1526318215

"&gt; . I would very much like to keep it civil

In other words, you refuse to discuss the single most important difference between r/btc and r/bitcoin, because you don't think it is ""civil"" to do so?
",1526318131
"&gt;&amp;gt;Yes, BTC use a 2000 blockchain windows calculation.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Not the whole blockchain.

&gt;Bitcoin difficulty adjustment schedule is dependent on the prior difficulty. Just as blocks are linked one-to-another all the way back to the genesis block, the difficulty is likewise linked to previous states. In order to fully validate the present difficulty target, one would need to apply the schedule over the entire history of the blockchain. This applies equally to BTC and BCH, however, validating BCH's present difficulty is complicated by the need to account for the changes in schedule.

No, the Bitcoin DAA only consider the past 2000 blocks window for its calculation and the precedente 2000 blocks to check the difficulty didn’t drop below some threshold.

And that it, there could be no block before those 4000 ones, it would make not difference for the DAA.


&gt;&amp;gt;BTC DAA is not healthy.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;It can only adapt every two weeks. It can create problems. (Inflation too fast, unable to adapt to quick change, etc..)

&gt;Are there any reasons why a slow-adjusting DAA might be favorable?

IMO none.

But a too-quick to adjust DAA can open the door to some attack vector.

&gt;&amp;gt;Not the inflation per day.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;The one that economically matters.

&gt;Why is inflation per day more economically significant than per-block inflation and total coin supply? 

Because if block arrive ten time faster your per-block inflation didn’t change but your currency supply skyrocketed.

What matters is to keep currency supply on schedule otherwise bitcoin is pointless.

&gt;If this is true, why overlook the impact of EDA on BCH's daily inflation rate? 

I don’t overlook it.

Inflation schedule has been broken on BCH that’s correct.

&gt;Although the replacement of EDA has reduced BCH's current inflation rate over absolute time, BCH's average daily inflation rate over the life of its chain is still higher than BTC's. 

It isn’t, BCH currency supply is on target and does a better job at keeping block intervals at 10min.

BTC block are avering consistently below 10min (block too fast, too much inflation)

&gt;If BCH were to gain majority miner support today and retain it moving forward, it would _always_ have a higher average daily inflation rate than BTC.

No.

I don’t know where you get that from?

&amp;gt;Yes, otherwise that mean bitcoin failed to follow a stable inflation schedule.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;This was on major selling point of cryptocurrencies

&gt;BCH has followed BTC's inflation schedule for most of its inflationary period (in terms of total coins generated). It has recently experienced hyper-inflation (in terms of per-day inflation rate) far beyond anything BTC has ever experienced. 

I agree that BCH inflation increased but nothing like hyperinflation, if anything it is few % of the total supply available.

Hyperinflation is measured in thousands of percent.

&gt;Although BCH's inflation has stabilized, its history of inflation is far less consistent than BTC.

Yes but ultimately BTC coin supply will surpass BCH.

and that goes rather fast, when the DAA got fixed BCH was ahead 9.000 block.

It is now only ahead 7.500

That mean BTC goes about 1500 blocks per fast per 6 months.

In 2 and half years bitcoin core supply should surpass BCH.

&gt;&amp;gt;Because the network might have to face large change in hash rate.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;With the current BTC DAA a large drop in hash rate Bitcoin core can take months to recover with an effective capacity hugely decreased.

&gt;Would this not be indicative of a more severe issue, either massive disinterest in mining or a communication problem? If the issue were temporary, a fast-adjusting DAA might cause more problems when it eventually resolves as a larger number of blocks could be potentially orphaned in the resulting reorg. 

What if it is for another reason?

Like chinese banning bitcoin mining and difficulty drop permanently 80%?

That would mean at least three to four month to recover while BCH will have recovered in few days.

&gt;This only seems particularly favorable to assist a minority chain, which is not a stated goal of the bitcoin system detailed in Satoshi's whitepaper.

There is no concept of minority chain in the white paper.

The white paper references longer chain to explain nodes behavior within a chain not separate ones.

"&gt;  would encourage you to do some more research into the technical aspects  of Bitcoin.  It's true that Bitcoin is a very complicated protocol, but  you don't need a programming background to understand it \-\- a  high\-level knowledge of cryptography, computer networks, and economics  can get you most of the way there.  

I'd agree. I like Unchained/Laura Shin bc she gets good interviews, but there are often \-p\-a\-i\-n\-f\-u\-l gaps in her understanding, either by what she just says 'oh...' to or asks a entirely incorrect 'so you did this, right...' and the interviewee responds 'no...',  that I can ID with only 1.5 yrs \+ in this space, and I don't run a podcast.

But Bitcoin took a while before the regular person could use it. I am personally not overly concerned about that. I understand that deveopment takes time. 

Censorship\-resistance is absolutely a hallmark feature of Bitcoin and I agree that censorship can be a bad thing. But, for example, I block people on Twitter that just get outraged by everything because I don't find it productive to have them on my feed. There are definitely two sides to this argument as the danger is creating a ""bubble"" that is insulated from alternative opinions. However, I really don't believe that anyone in rBitcoin isn't aware of the block size debate. 

As for the ""gate\-keepers"" of the bitcoin code, open\-source projects are hard. It requires a majority concensus and the contributers have changed a lot over many years. Code review is an important factor, and these elements combined, equals slow change. It's why mimble wimble may never be adopted by Bitcoin. Which is a real shame. 

I do think that it would be foolish to think that BCH won't run into the same issues if it overtakes bitcoin.",1526317886

"I think the suggestion is that btc’s uncompetitive fee market should be regarded as a symptom of insufficient m decentralization. Decentralization should ensure that an economically competitive fee, ie. one that pays the miners for the cost of blockspace, is accepted. But because block space has been regulated on the protocol level, this is not the case. Hence uncompetitive fees is a sign that btc lacks “decentralization”. 

I think it’s an interesting argument and prima face convincing. Certainly, competitiveness of mining fees is an intriguing metric for gauging the degree of decentralization. ",1526317826

"I commend you for your constructive attitude and effort on trying to understand the ecosystem, by speaking to all the relevant sides and trying to remain as neutral as possible.

I believe we need more people like you, genuinely interested in separating the facts from the opinion, without resorting to drama, without being satisfied with skimming the surface, and very important also that you are aware of your own technical shortcomings, not just to be truthful, but also you can make make it easier for many non-technical people. This is very needed.

I'm positive that if you continue this path it can lead to a very positive effect to the crypto space, and bring clarity where is most needed right now.

Because I put myself in the shoes of a newcomer to the space and my head spins. I don't think I could explain it to myself if I hadn't been here since late 2012. This has been a journey like from a science fiction novel, and there are more volumes coming at a pace is hard to keep up with.

Personally I also wonder (sorry for what I'm gonna say) how soon will you realize you are also a ""big blocker"". Because I can't see how Bitcoin could be useful for mankind without on-chain scaling. What I do see is the recurrent struggle to control a revolutionary idea by handcuffing its spirit.

But regardless of anyone's opinion, it's important you put the pieces together by yourself, and to keep doing it the way you feel is best.

Good luck and I wish you the best.

I do though appreciate some aspects of Bitcoin Cash too.

I hold and spend. As I am a miner, I am in the cycle where I accumulate BTC and BCH and then spend it to pay my bills. I don't use either day to day as the tech and use case for everyday purchases is not improved over my debit card at present.

"The poison block issue isn't really an issue now, so BCH should be just fine.

The reason it was an issue is because at the time is because BTC had no real world value yet, so it cost miners nothing at all to create poison blocks and attack the chain. Without a real Dollar value on BTC the incentives that should keep a miner honest simply didn't work yet, so Satoshi put the 1mb limitation in as a stop-gap (and 1Mb was still massive overhead at the time, 1000x bigger than the largest blocks). The 1mb limit was no longer needed since exchanges came online, and miners greed could be properly leveraged to secure the chain instead of attacking it in bad faith, because they would now have to spend money to attack.

"&gt;me groups made very loud noises that this would not work if everyone did not upgrade.  They proposed other options that could fool old nodes into thinking following along.

That's an interesting point. Old 'nodes' not catching updates is a classic issue in tech so that's a valid concern in my mind.

&gt;  I am very happy that Bitcoin Cash continued the scaling approach that  was described by Satoshi.  Scientific testing has shown that this can  work without ill effects.  Now, real world activity has proven it. 

\(questions, not accusations, but I've gotten lit up here before for these w/o getting answers, but here goes:\)

\-Was 'larger blocks' ever described as the cut\-and\-dry 'this is how it'll scale"" by satoshi? I haven't found that in the white paper, also I've dug through the archived emails and such and didn't see that. Would it better to phrase that along the lines of  'found *a way* to scale that kept TXs in\-line with Satoshi's general theory of how the blockchain should be used?' 

\-what scientific testing? 

\-\(opinion\) Can under a year of existence really be strong,,real\-world proof that big blocks work with no ill effects? There are several other cryptos out there that have lasted for a year \+, but are well known to have faults but the market keeps stringing them along. I'd have to think that BCH would have to go through one or two block\-size increases, after full blocks, before this reaches proof of concept. ",1526317732

"Value is related to peoples opinion. 1btc is by definition 1btc. x = x. 

what you can buy with 1btc ( x = y ) will changed based on inflation and many other factors. As more btc gets mined, assuming that was the only factor involved, you are correct the price would go down. that is because the supply would exceed the demand. It is also possible that the 12.5 btc reward will not keep up with demand, in which case the price would go up. It is also possible that a flaw will be found in the code and people switch to another coin, in which case the supply will continue going up and the demand will drop, causing the price to drop.

To sum it up. $1 = $1, 1btc = 1btc. $1 or 1btc today might be not be valued the same as it will be tomorrow. Inflation is only one out of many factors that determine what the value is.

to quote your original comment: ""...so 1btc does lose buying power until year 2140."" is incorrect, it's supply will increase, but its buying power (value) has been going up consistently since it was created. in 2012 1btc was ~$5 currently it is ~$8700. I 'll bet you an upvote that this trend will continue. This is to the fact the the amount of demand (new adopters) will outpace the rate at witch it is mined(inflation).

This isn't a marketing schtick, and it's not an attempt to trick people. Bitcoin Cash is the same system of Bitcoin that I have been using since 2012. When BTC became expensive and slow, it stopped being Bitcoin as far as I'm concerned.

I have a lot more in common with the maximalists of the Bitcoin Core side than I do with the millions of token speculators that currently seem to form the majority of the cryptocurrency industry. I guess where we differ is in our ideas about whether Bitcoin should actually be useful as a currency or not.

When you write a sentence like

&gt;When a new investor goes onto Coinbase, they will see two Bitcoin's.

I think that this demonstrates a fundamental difference in the way we think about Bitcoin. To me, it has never been about ""investing""... I use Bitcoin *as money.* I like the idea of being my own bank, I like the idea of using Bitcoin to send money around the world without third parties or with high fees, and I like the idea of a form of sound money that is outside the control of governments.

In economic terms you have to relate to this not as demand and supply for goods and services. But demand and supply of btc. When you add more goods to the supply chain, you will need a higher value of btc to meet the demand for buying that good. At some point the price may get to a point which shifts this demand to spend to a demand to save. At that point goods produced will decrease. As the goods decrease the price of btc will fall because savings will accumulated to the point it acts against economic activity. Which in turn will make savers want to invest more to spur more activity and produce more goods. This in turn will increase the price. It’s inflationary or expansive and deflationary or retractive. Depends on how the markets will weigh in on it. But this is a long way from where we are today. A few decades will pass at that point. We will see the most gains in our lifetime and future generations will see the stability.

I do think it's great that you are at least interviewing both sides of the debate and trying to remain neutral.

One critique I will give is that in the beginning of both interviews I listened to (Roger Ver and CSW), you spent a lot of time explaining why you were interviewing them, and it almost felt like you were apologizing to your audience for conducting the interviews.  If you want to be as impartial as possible, then eliminate the pretext and just let the interviews speak for themselves.

And while you may not have a technical background, I would encourage you to do some more research into the technical aspects of Bitcoin.  It's true that Bitcoin is a very complicated protocol, but you don't need a programming background to understand it -- a high-level knowledge of cryptography, computer networks, and economics can get you most of the way there.

The deliberate social attack from Axa/Blockstream/Core and the survival of Bitcoin in the form of Bitcoin Cash has been a litmus test for Bitcoin. In the end it will show that this technology can't be cornered without morphing into a better state.,1526315623

"&gt;The 10 minute block intervals are due to the variable difficulty of the PoW.

Yes, and the reason for this system is to allow blocks to have a chance to fully propagate even across slower links. Miners on poor infrastructure are indeed harmed by this over their competitors, but this is a case where the protocol should not be punished because some countries or cities have better infrastructure than others. It should be a call to invest and improve the infrastructure in that case. 

&gt;Please point me to the 32mb and variable block size source - that is “news” to me.

For that you need to have a firm grasp on the whitepaper as well as the code in the client. The best I could do is link you the whitepaper and Core repo. 

Satoshi's very first client had an upper boundary of 32mb only as a limitation of the way the client handles data and networking as first built, at the time far far beyond what was likely needed for many years. This does not mean all blocks would be 32mb 100% of the time, this is just the maximum size any block *can be*. Block sizes float within this space depending on how many transactions occurred since the last block,  and is effectively governed between some of the economic forces you mentioned like bandwidth, storage, electricity, etc. These forces create an average block size, with the ability to handle a peak transaction load when needed. This is why Bitcoin has the incentive structures it does. Blocks started very small, only kilobytes within this massive 32mb headroom.

The 1mb limit was put in place temporarily by Satoshi to prevent an issue called *poison blocks*, which was an issue due to Bitcoin having no relative Dollar value yet, so miners could create massive blocks for free that would choke the rest of the network. BTC experienced massive problems last year because the average block size hit the 1mb limitation (having floated from 0 Mb up to 1 Mb in a few years) which causes massive distortions in fees and transaction times. This is why BTC is basically broken now, having strayed from the original design by keeping the 1mb limit. 

Bitcoin Cash is completely removing any artificial limits tomorrow back to the original 32mb, which is easy since it was already designed that way from the beginning.",1526315602

"&gt;Yes, BTC use a 2000 blockchain windows calculation.
&gt;
&gt; Not the whole blockchain.

Bitcoin difficulty adjustment schedule is dependent on the prior difficulty. Just as blocks are linked one-to-another all the way back to the genesis block, the difficulty is likewise linked to previous states. In order to fully validate the present difficulty target, one would need to apply the schedule over the entire history of the blockchain. This applies equally to BTC and BCH, however, validating BCH's present difficulty is complicated by the need to account for the changes in schedule.

&gt;BTC DAA is not healthy.
&gt;
&gt;It can only adapt every two weeks. It can create problems. (Inflation too fast, unable to adapt to quick change, etc..)

Are there any reasons why a slow-adjusting DAA might be favorable?


&gt;Not the inflation per day.
&gt;
&gt;The one that economically matters.

Why is inflation per day more economically significant than per-block inflation and total coin supply? If this is true, why overlook the impact of EDA on BCH's daily inflation rate? Although the replacement of EDA has reduced BCH's current inflation rate over absolute time, BCH's average daily inflation rate over the life of its chain is still higher than BTC's. If BCH were to gain majority miner support today and retain it moving forward, it would _always_ have a higher average daily inflation rate than BTC.

&gt;Yes, otherwise that mean bitcoin failed to follow a stable inflation schedule.
&gt;
&gt;This was on major selling point of cryptocurrencies

BCH has followed BTC's inflation schedule for most of its inflationary period (in terms of total coins generated). It has recently experienced hyper-inflation (in terms of per-day inflation rate) far beyond anything BTC has ever experienced. Although BCH's inflation has stabilized, its history of inflation is far less consistent than BTC.

&gt;Because the network might have to face large change in hash rate.
&gt;
&gt;With the current BTC DAA a large drop in hash rate Bitcoin core can take months to recover with an effective capacity hugely decreased.

Would this not be indicative of a more severe issue, either massive disinterest in mining or a communication problem? If the issue were temporary, a fast-adjusting DAA might cause more problems when it eventually resolves as a larger number of blocks could be potentially orphaned in the resulting reorg. This only seems particularly favorable to assist a minority chain, which is not a stated goal of the bitcoin system detailed in Satoshi's whitepaper.

"*Bitcoins**
The bitcoin is a digital currency that only exists online. He
exists since January 1, 2009 and can be used to pay in
online stores or for other online services.
Bitcoins are not, as normal money, by a central bank
circulation. Instead, all bitcoins that are in circulation are
created by letting computers work on solutions from
selected mathematical problems. That works like this:
Anyone can run special software on his or her computer
contributes to solving such a mathematical problem. The owner
of the computer that finds the solution to a problem
25 (newly created) bitcoins as a reward. Because in 2014 every
10 minutes such a problem was solved, were there in this way
every 25 minutes 25 bitcoins are put into circulation.
On 1 January 2014 there were (approximately) 12.2 million bitcoins in circulation.

*Calculate the number of bitcoins in circulation starting from this year
above 18 million as the rate at which bitcoins are in circulation
not be changed.*

In reality, the speed with which bitcoins get in circulation
not equal to 25 bitcoins per 10 minutes. This speed is taking
namely. During the first four years, from 1 January 2009 to
January 1, 2013, the reward per solution was 50 bitcoins. The
reward for finding a solution is every four years
halved: from 1 January 2013 to 1 January 2017, the remuneration is per
solution 25 bitcoins, for the next four years 12.5 bitcoins per solution
and so on.
*From which year calculate the reward for each solution less than one bitcoin*
will be.
The total number of bitcoins that can be put into circulation is limited.
This is a consequence of (among other things) the fact that the remuneration per
solution is always halved. The total number of bitcoins that are in
circulation, can be approximated with the formula:
C=21 - 21 * 0.5 ^0.25 - t
Here C is the total number of bitcoins in millions and t the time in years with
t  0 on 1 January 2009.
*Use the reasoning of the formula to determine the
limit value of the total number of bitcoins in circulation.*

To regulate the total number of bitcoins in circulation is not
only the number of bitcoins per solution is made smaller, but also
the difficulty of mathematical problems is increasing
made. There are more and more people who bring their computers
let it count.
The difficulty of the problems increases exponentially according to the
formula D=3.65 * e ^0.533 - t
Here D is a measure of the degree of difficulty and the time in months
with t = 0 on 1 January 2013. The larger is D, how
harder to solve the problem.
*Compose the formula of the derivative of D and explain how to handle this formula can see that the graph of D is increasing.*
The formula can be rewritten in such a way that you can use a difficulty level
fill in and calculate the time in months needed to do so
level of difficulty.

"Banning of ~~crypto~~ book printing


&gt;The invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg around 1440 changed the nature of book publishing. As of the 16th century, in most European countries both the church and governments attempted to regulate and control printing. Governments established controls over printers across Europe, requiring them to have official licenses to trade and produce books. In 1557 the English Crown aimed to stem the flow of dissent by chartering the Stationers' Company. The right to print was restricted to the two universities (Oxford and Cambridge) and the 21 existing printers in the City of London. In France, the 1551 Edict of Châteaubriant included provisions for unpacking and inspecting all books brought into France. The 1557 Edict of Compiègne applied the death penalty to heretics and resulted in the burning of a noblewoman at the stake.

"**Homeopathy**

Homeopathy or homœopathy is a system of alternative medicine developed in 1796 by Samuel Hahnemann, based on his doctrine of like cures like (similia similibus curentur), a claim that a substance that causes the symptoms of a disease in healthy people would cure similar symptoms in sick people. Homeopathy is a pseudoscience – a belief that is incorrectly presented as scientific. Homeopathic preparations are not effective for treating any condition; large-scale studies have found homeopathy to be no more effective than a placebo, indicating that any positive effects that follow treatment are only due to the placebo effect, normal recovery from illness, or regression toward the mean.

Hahnemann believed the underlying causes of disease were phenomena that he termed miasms, and that homeopathic preparations addressed these.

"&gt;Can the time \(3 days\) be changed? Is it possible to write the smart contract that opens the channel in a way that the two parties can decide how much time the other party has to broadcast the punishing transaction if one of them cheats?

Yes, it can be changed. I just suppose 3 days may be a typical situation. Even without internet connectivity, if you find the cheat through the satellite feed, 3 days should be enough. I suppose it won't be difficult to send the punishing transaction via SMS message to a service with internet connection and then checking back again your own transaction from the satellite feed.

&gt;Is a watchtower a specific and special node? Can it broadcast punishing transactions?

Yes. Watchtowers continuously monitor the blockchain in search of fraudulent transactions. If that is the case, they typically broadcast the punishing transaction.

&gt;I have been wondering if all intermediate states can be broadcast and stored, while not activated, by nodes in the network rather than just on the two nodes, and the punishing can be done automatically by any node that detects the cheat. Is it possible?

As you may already know, Lightning transactions are not normally ""broadcast"" as in the Bitcoin P2P protocol. They are sent and received directly by the two parties in a channel. AFAIK broadcasting the messages does not forfeit any control to listeners \(except for losing the privacy of payments\). This is because these messages are still half\-signed so they cannot be enforced on the blockchain.

Many different nodes could act as watchtowers if that is what you want. The user who wants to defend himself against cheats can forward the fully signed punishing transaction to as many watchtowers as he likes.",1526313791

"I wish you the best of luck in trying to stay neutral.  It would be a challenge.

Like many here, we want a bitcoin that can work for everyone, everywhere.  I used to participate in meetups and tried to get merchants to adopt Bitcoin.  Back in 2014, when someone asked what would happen when blocks got full, the stock answer was 'increase the block size'.

Some groups made very loud noises that this would not work if everyone did not upgrade.  They proposed other options that could fool old nodes into thinking following along.

This started years of debates.  I simply wanted to be on a chain that could grow and expand.  We weren't near any technical limits, so there would be no harm.

Then Lightning Network was proposed as a way to handle micropayments (transactions where even a 1-cent fee was too large).  Channels would be funded with maybe $10 and all would be good.

Then LN got morphed into being the only way normal people would be able to transaction on the BTC chain.  This was not the goal of LN, and creates many other problems.  The foremost problem was that LN did not exist yet, and that even if it did, more on-chain transaction capacity would be needed.

But they stood firm on holding to the small blocks.

I stopped going to meetups.  I definitely stopped promoting to merchants.  Until the scaling debate was resolved, it was not wise to suggest bitcoin to others.

I am very happy that Bitcoin Cash continued the scaling approach that was described by Satoshi.  Scientific testing has shown that this can work without ill effects.  Now, real world activity has proven it.

The two sides can go their own ways.  Maybe both will win.

I think, if LN eventually works and scales, BCH can adopt it.  It will be an alternative for small transactions, not a mandate.

Let the market choose.",1526313721

"&gt;The difficulty adjustment is linked to the whole chain. Under the original schedule, present difficulty is a function of the previous difficulty and the duration of the previous adjustment period. It is a rather straight forward calculation. 

Yes, BTC use a 2000 blockchain windows calculation.

Not the whole blockchain.

&gt;The current BCH schedule is likewise linked to prior difficulty, though more complicated due to its more dynamic nature and the need to account for the multiple changes in schedule.

BCH use a shorter window and recalculate per block.



&gt;I'm not assigning a positive or negative value to these facts, simply stating the reality. If changes to the difficulty adjustment schedule were warranted and healthy, 

BTC DAA is not healthy.

It can only adapt every two weeks. It can create problems. (Inflation too fast, unable to adapt to quick change, etc..)

&gt;then there should be no problem highlighting them as part of the changes BCH introduced.

It is a change, but it is 100% compatible with bitcoin as discribe by the white paper. (As opposed to 1MB blocks)

&gt;Why shouldn't increasing inflation be permitted in bitcoin, so long as the fixed coin generation limit is maintained? 

Because it change the economics characteristics of bitcoin.



&gt;Certainly the EDA was unsuccessful in this regard, but that has been addressed. 

BTC DAA hasn’t been fixed.

&gt;However, during the EDA a common pro-BCH argument, and one I can find some agreement with, is that bitcoin's inflation is fixed and measured over blocks, not strictly days. 

If block comes fasted, inflation describes in economic term increases.

&gt;EDA did not increase the inflation per-block inflation rate nor the absolute coin generation amount. Likewise, BTC's slower-adjusting difficulty schedule maintains the per-block inflation rate and absolute coin generation.

Not the inflation per day.

The one that matters.

&gt;Why is it better that the difficulty adjustment should rapidly adjust? 

Because the network might have to face large change in hash rate.

With the current BTC DAA a large drop in hash rate Bitcoin core can take months to recover with an effective capacity hugely decreased.

&gt;Does that better _compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time_ and does it better support the primary objective of bitcoin's proof-of-work scheme that _the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any competing chain_?

Yes, otherwise that mean bitcoin failed to follow a stable inflation schedule.

In economics, a shock is an unexpected or unpredictable event that affects an economy, either positively or negatively. Technically, it refers to an unpredictable change in exogenous factors — that is, factors unexplained by economics — which may influence endogenous economic variables.

The response of economic variables, like output and employment, at the time of the shock and at subsequent times, is measured by an impulse response function.

Honestly, it is relentless. ",1526312938
"That has an easy fix: bring them back or buy Bitcoin :)

I can see all countries banning Bitcoin are weak and fearful.",1526312915
"Very misleading title.  From the third paragraph:

"Many of the coins listed, requires a base currency, since there isn't a direct USD pairing. So you are always left with the question of whether you were better of holding that base currency.

Since Bitcoin is often the base currency, and very stabile (for crypto), many base their investment on its performance vs satoshi. 

It might not matter to you, but it DOES matter to many investing in crypto, and is not irrelevant as you put it.",1526312884

You get paid in relation to the value you create.  There is a lot of value right now in securing crypto networks thanks to the mass corruption in our society.  They should thank the politicians... if we had sound money their would be no profit in this.,1526312583
"I still disagree (respectfully). It doesnt matter if the coin is following the market or moving on its own. If it is worth more USD, i'm happy. Thats a sound investment.

Also, the same can be done by looking at the value/market cap ratio, which would be in USD and would be a much clearer picture of what you said above. This can be used across all coins and accurately determine which coins are out performing others.


As BTC loses dominance it will be less and less important to look at those ratios. This will happen no matter what as the industry matures this is inevitable. BTC may still be very strong but it cannot hold 30-40% market share forever ",1526312576
Consensus is a core principle for every blockchain. As for example take a look at BTC BCH drama where they already lost the war \(Cash fans\) but they still manage to create problems for the real chain.,1526312574
"Denial.

(Why would I hold fiat that loses value over time, when I can hold bitcoin, that even when the S curve adoption is over at least increases in purchasing power with increase in overall productivity and population growth?)

Google Nakamoto Institute Hyperbitcoinization.",1526312556
"More dumbed down waffle from someone who can't do math and doesn't understand that this revolution started because Bitcoin is leaderless and decentralized.

Bcash is neither of those things.

You are deluding yourself. Study up and stop wit the bankster funded bcash shilling. ",1526312544
"The point of bitcoin is not to make anybody rich. You cannot ""miss out"". If you see it that way, you are in it for the wrong reasons. ",1526312522
"Luke claimed long ago that ""bitcoin could never work"" so he is trying to make his failed flat world vision of a failed Bitcoin come true

too bad the world isn't flat, so all his other backwards ideas are just that, backwards",1526312514
"Sorry, I was upset but the truth is, Gemini made no announcement about ""adding"" Bitcoin Cash BUT, they did announce when and exactly how they will support zcash. 

I am mostly in BCH, so don't get me wrong, I want this, but they may be putting it off due to the fork or politics. Here, Forbes got confirmation that Gemin applied for and received ability to trade zcahs, BCH..., but again, Gemini themselves have only announced zcash, it is a big difference. ",1526312507
"Cheers for stopping by.  We're all learning hopefully, even those who know the most.  Disappointed to hear you've been called a ""fucking idiot"" from Bitcoin Cash supporters.  I've never seen that occur but not saying it hasn't happened.  Usually people with unpopular opinions just get downvoted here.

I'd have only one additional comment to make:  if you are finding you are surprised by some of the things you might be discovering \(unsolved problems with LN, history behind the scaling debate\) I think you should blame the censorship in the other camp.  You seemed to me to be a little to dismissive of its importance \(ie damage\) when it came up briefly in your interview with Ver.

All the best with your research.",1526312442
"Sure it can. Anything can, now that BTC is useless. ",1526312423
Psst if you think crypto is in anyway fully established I don't know what to tell you. The past 5 years were ground work to actually become established. The industry as a whole is a tiny blip compared to what it will become as it goes mainstream.,1526312414
Either way he isn't helping his cause by not going to the biggest crypto event of the year. ,1526312375
"Agreed to that, but the volume on Gemini is about 30m for eth and 30m for btc per day.

Do they have access to institutional investors ? That might make a bigger difference ",1526312370
"There are quite a few independent coins now that started as BTC dapps. You an thank Blockstream for destroying this momentum and fragmenting the space away from unifying behind one base protocol. Bitcoin originally started out a lot more like Ethereum than people think. Its a protocol to build services on, which BTC developers forgot long ago. ",1526312340
"Think cryptography is bulletproof? Think again…
Lest you think that the cryptography of cryptocurrency is secure and bulletproof, consider this article from The Hacker News: Researchers Crack 1024-bit RSA Encryption in GnuPG Crypto Library, which states, “The attack allows an attacker to extract the secret crypto key from a system by analyzing the pattern of memory utilization or the electromagnetic outputs of the device that are emitted during the decryption process.”

Note, importantly, that this is a 1024-bit encryption system. The same technique is also said to be able to crack 2048-bit encryption. In fact, encryption layers are cracked on a daily basis by clever hackers. Some of those encryption layers are powering various cryptocurrencies right now. Unless you are an extremely high-level mathematician, there’s no way you can know for sure whether any crypto currency is truly non-hackable.

In fact, every cryptocurrency becomes obsolete with the invention of large-scale quantum computing. Once China manages to build a working 256-bit quantum computer, it can effectively steal all the Bitcoins in the world (plus steal most national secrets and commit other global mayhem at will).",1526312332
"Yep idk, not sure what is going on this is really insane though I for sure will never expect BTC to handle my transactions in a timely manner again.",1526312325
"bitcoin.com never listed Bitcoin Cash as BTC.

It listed it thus;

* Bitcoin (BCH)
* Bitcoin Core (BTC)

Which got the corey's knickers in a right twist.",1526312306
of course... and also all the btc lost over the years due to wrong addresses and lost keys means same amount of BCH out of circulation there too,1526312255
"Yep think that’s the way it is going, still means crypto will be worth bundles.",1526312247
"It's hard to say how that will play out in the U.S. But if you want the answer to that question, just follow current events in Zimbabwe and Venezuela, two places suffering from currency hyperinflation. People *need* to use money for everyday life. If the local money sucks, like it does in those two countries, then people will use another type of money, be it bitcoin or cowery shells. And if btc and shells are illegal, people will just use them anyway. Money is the ledger of a society",1526312224
"Thank you for your reply!  This was kind of a shower thought that I had.  

As he has an estimated 1 million bitcoin that have sat for years.  This would also mean that there would be ~1 million Bitcoin Cash out of circulation as well?",1526312175
Ive been following @csuwildcat for awhile. He has been dropping hints about this all last year. The future is going to be decentralized its just been a matter of time since Bitcoin/ decentralized trust was invented. MSFT incorporating Bitcoin and existing blockchain tech proves that theres no point trying to dev a replacement when the best is already decentralized.,1526312144
"""In addition to being approved to custody and trade Zcash the NYDFS has confirmed to Forbes that Gemini will also receive approvals for Bitcoin Cash, with a total market value of $25 billion and Litecoin, valued at $8.2 billion, though details about when these currencies might go live remain sparse.""

Nothing concrete yet, but saying ""nothing about BCH"" sounds deceiving.",1526312134

"if i give my mom 10 troy oz of gold, she may find a basic use of it as a door stop or paper weight, it fundamentally provides at least some basic use like a rock, it would have some nonzero value.  this basic fundamental intrinsic value is far off the market value where its properties are used whether by nature of the material or by monetary history.

"The 10 minute block intervals are due to the variable difficulty of the PoW.  In a distributed system such as bitcoin, nodes only talk to their neighbors and “gossip” the blocks as they are minted.  If blocks are too big - the miners with the most hashing power have a significant advantage as they can start on the next block while other peers, who are unaware of a new block, are at a major disadvantage if the data takes too long to reach them as they must validate and start from scratch on the next block - this just keeps getting worse as blocks grow.  This is what satoshi meant by obsolete blocks.

Instead we’re going to get a new ultra billionaire class that have got huge bags and are going to accumulate more and more of the coins that will last in the long term. When crypto takes off it’s could very well creat the first trillion-air, and that person will have deflationary assets that will solidify their families power for the foreseeable future. It’s not going to fix the problem we all hoped it would, and that bums me out. But I can atleast secure my family with a good life if keep paying attention and do what they are doing but on a much smaller scale.",1526311714

"A wallet is just software that simplifies the management of your private key, generating public keys and performing transactions on the block chain.  

That said, Satoshi has a private key that controls the public addresses of his bitcoin.  His public addresses on the BTC block chain were included (along with everyone else's) in the hard fork of BCH.  

This means the correct way to think of it is. ""Satoshi has a private key that controls public addresses with the same number of BCH as he has BTC.""  

As for a wallet, since he has the private key controlling those addresses, he can import his private key into a BCH wallet to transact on the block chain.  There is no way to know if he has done this.  ",1526311654

"Yes it is. Decentralized tokens of value that aren't issued or controlled from a central authority is clearly better. It takes away a lot of the labour from financial institutions and the labour that's left over has less, if any, of an effect on the flow and control of that token of value. The labour that's removed from financial institutions could be placed in positions of medical or scientific research, essential public services etc.

But your retort misses the point completely. We're a slave to the fiat system because their is no alternative. If you create value you are legally obliged to participate in the fiat system. Removing this barrier means people will be able to more freely create value and, therefore, more valuable things can be created.

What is the ""crypto system"" by the way? I'm sure you know seeing as you referenced it, but I'd like for you to elaborate. Maybe you'll convince me yet.

Also, your response assumes that assuming is bad. You literally null\-and\-voided your own argument with that statement.

If I lend you 1 bitcoin in 2016 (USD ~$400) how would you feel about paying it back now after a ~2200% increase? What if, in an alternative timeline, 1 BTC was today instead worth $14?

In this way deflation further benefits the wealthy and money lenders (a minority), while inflation benefits the debtors(the majority). Since we live in a society which requires some level of debt, a slow inflation tied to improved wages is nearly universally seen as a preferable arrangement.

"&gt; gold has not been used as day-to-day money for at least a hundred years.

As you probably know, the United States was still on a gold standard until 1972, when the USD stopped being backed by physical gold. This is not the same as gold coins being used as payment but there is a case to be made there. The Swiss Franc (considered by many the safest currency in the world) was still backed by gold as late as May in the year 2000.

&gt; This means that if Fred gives you gold today, and you want to spend it with Ernie who is 6 hours away, then your gold piece is out of circulation for 6 hours minimum.

OK I admit this is true. However, 3 billion people can all make a gold transaction simultaneously to the other 3 billion people in the world, so we can say that gold has a transaction limit on the order of 3 billion transactions in 6 hours, or over 100k transactions per second.

&gt; Also. Gold cannot be transacted online. It has very high transaction friction. It is not easily divisible. The idea that it will come back as ""money"" is absurd.

Of course I know that Bitcoin has many advantages over gold, which is why I am here. But gold also has some important properties that both fiat and bitcoin lack (perfect fungibility, worldwide diffusion, long history of being resistant to tamper and counterfeit etc). I think that even if gold returns as a backing for private banknotes (not central bank fiat) then it can be transacted online etc. relatively easily. I think it is very conceivable that gold returns at least in some capacity as a world currency, which is why central banks and many private investors around the world continue to store gold.",1526310347
"By getting the latest node it validates that the transaction and shows you own the cryptocurrency.

As I have said, the point of crypto is to have every failsafe way make sure that there is proof that the funds are yours - it’s trustless. So far, miners cannot be trusted and miners are centralized.

I understand the on chain scaling debate, and see where BCash is trying to go, but BTC implementing LN and possibility of fraud is the lesser of two evils and at the discretion of two parties. As such, you cannot force someone to enter into an agreement. By creating a LN, the trust has already been established by actions outside the ledger network.

Decentralization in its entirety means:
-being able to have a failsafe plan to confirm your own funds
-not having any one entity being too powerful (miners)
-giving people the power to freely set agreements and contracts with whomever they want with LN, while still being able to go the trustless route with SegWit",1526310336

"&gt; But this added behavior can only be a further restriction of previously existing rules, and not the introduction of a new rule or criteria that previously did not exist. SegWit breaks this definition in multiple ways as I've spelled out in the detailed expalantion I've linked, and as you yourself have demonstrated through two new examples of your own. 

Please cite, from the bitcoin wiki, this definition of soft fork. Because it isn't there. The only criteria is that a soft fork only makes previously valid blocks invalid. The only criteria for a hard fork is that previously invalid blocks are made valid.

(By the way, I disagree that communicating additional data via a side channel is ""the introduction of new criteria"". The old criteria was ""communicate whatever you want over the side channel"", and the new criteria is ""side channel data must contain segwit extension data under conditions X"". That is what I call a restriction. Similarly, the introduction of namecoin merged mining stipulates the inclusion of a special transaction in every block. That is also a restriction even though it may seem to be an entirely new rule. Feel free to disagree, it's not important.)

&gt; You'd be right here IF there was no resulting chain fork afterwards. Since there would be in this case it proves that SegWit is not a soft fork, but a disguised hard fork. It can't be a backwards compatible change if just exercising previously available functionality forks the chain. 

Not part of the definition of a soft fork.

&gt; For the last time: After SegWit activates, non-SegWit nodes can no longer verify every transaction

Not part of the definition of a soft fork.

&gt; I've showed you this repeatedly: any time a non-SegWit client spends a SegWit Anyone Can Spend transaction, that's **a block that is valid under old rules, but invalid under SegWit rules**. Are you following now? 

A softfork is a change to the bitcoin protocol **wherein only previously valid blocks/transactions are made invalid. ** https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Softfork

"Without quantifying ""bigger"", the conversation can be misleading.  Huge blocks would mean data centers today.  But huge is probably something like 1GB today.  (Some home equipment could keep up with &gt;100MB blocks).

When a person gets into mining today, that is ~$1500 upfront cost of a mining ASIC and ~$100/mo in electricity.  That would be pretty close to the cost of a computer and bandwidth to run a node capable of sustaining 100MB blocks.

I'm not really sure how many individual mining setups exist today.  My opinion is that most individuals interested in smaller mining are into altcoins.  I think (again, opinion), that most Bitcoin mining is already done with fairly large ASIC farms.  In any case, a single node can serve the entire ASIC count.  Perhaps even a handful of ASICS is considered small time mining today.  So, *in the case where BCH transactions required 100MB blocks*, economical BCH mining might require &gt;10 ASICS per node.  I last estimated ASIC count (several months ago) at &gt;700,000 units worldwide.

So those numbers would say 100MB blocks would economically result in ~70,000 miners worldwide (given other factors don't provide more centralizing pressure).

"For those of you in front of the paywall:

LONDON — Central banks could use cryptocurrencies to allow them to aggressively cut interest rates in the future, mitigating the impacts of any future financial crisis.

That's according to a new report from Morgan Stanley, which dissects the possible central bank applications for digital currencies in future.

A Morgan Stanley team led by strategist Sheena Shah identified several areas of possible central bank use for crypto, but made clear that their research was ""not intended to suggest where we think a digital fiat currency could be implemented or all the reasons why.""

Perhaps the most eye\-catching potential application is in the area of monetary policy, where Morgan Stanley argues that digital currencies could allow central banks to take interest rates into deeper negative territory than ever before should they need to in the event of a major financial crisis.

During the last crisis, global central banks cut interest rates aggressively to protect consumers and lenders from the worst impacts of that crisis, with a handful of central banks in the likes of Sweden, Denmark, Japan, and the eurozone, plunging rates into negative territory. Negative rates remain in numerous states, although no central bank has cut rates below \-0.5&amp;#37;.

Several European countries have rates in negative territory already. Morgan Stanley

Digital currencies could change that, Shah and her team suggest, saying that: ""Theoretically, a monetary system that is 100&amp;#37; digital may enable deeper negative rates.""

""This appeals to certain central banks,"" the team continues.

""Freely circulating paper notes and coins \(cash\) limits the ability of the central banks to force negative deposit rates. A digital version of cash could theoretically allow negative deposit rates to be charged on all money in circulation within any economy.""

Such an idea could be a major reassurance for central banks, with UBS Investment Bank arguing late in 2017 that when the next financial crisis hits, rates in major economies could be forced to drop as low as \-5&amp;#37; to mitigate its impacts. Using traditional monetary policy tools to do so would be virtually impossible, but the advent of central bank digital currencies may provide an outlet for such a possibility.

Of course, as with any experimental idea, there are potential drawbacks, with Morgan Stanley saying that ""deep and long\-standing negative rates eventually are problematic for banks.""

""Central banks would then have to go direct to currency users to implement monetary policy, reducing leverage in the system significantly and cutting GDP growth.""

Central bank interest in the crypto space has increased significantly over the last 18 months or so, with the likes of the Bank of England setting up specifically focused task forces to examine the benefits of digital currencies. In Sweden, the Riksbank is considering the introduction of its own digital currency, the eKrona.

Some central bankers are more sceptical. Last year, for example, Jens Weidmann, the head of Germany's Bundesbank warned that digital currencies like bitcoin have the potential to make financial crises in the future even more devastating.

Weidmann said he believes that central banks will eventually create their own digital currencies to reassure average citizens that such currencies are safe and stable, but in doing so could increase the risk of bank runs in future crises.",1526308909

"**Money supply**

In economics, the money supply (or money stock) is the total value of monetary assets available in an economy at a specific time. There are several ways to define ""money"", but standard measures usually include currency in circulation and demand deposits (depositors' easily accessed assets on the books of financial institutions).

Money supply data are recorded and published, usually by the government or the central bank of the country. Public and private sector analysts have long monitored changes in the money supply because of the belief that it affects the price level, inflation, the exchange rate and the business cycle.

No. What allows trustless use of bitcoin is the ability to verify that the rules that you know of. Otherwise, bitcoin would not be trustless (see colored coins).

Only if they mine and have more than 50% hashpower. If the old chain has more than 50% hashpower, the soft fork never activates and old nodes are perfectly secure.

Your arguments failed to convince me. Please provide a clear example of how old nodes no longer operate trustlessly under segwit.

&gt;I don't know about which la-la-land ancap copyright definition u're talking about, but here's Wikipedia's

I have been very clear to distinguish when I am talking about 1) root moral principles and the validity of axioms, 2) hypothetical voluntary systems, or 3) the current system and where it is in accordance with just principles and where it could be improved.

&gt;""Copyright is a legal right created by the law of a country that grants the creator of an original work exclusive rights for its use and distribution""

&gt;That means creator has a ""right"" to affect people's access to Bitcoin if the ledger 

Nope! Sorry. Nowhere in the definition you provided is that specified. Even a state-based system could work completely based on *personal liability for damages*, as the current system largely does.

&gt;Much more sophisticated things than Napster and TPB will appear

I'm sure that's true! But the fact that murdering  or mugging people is made easier by owning a lasergun does not make murdering or mugging with a lasergun ok. It also doesn't mean that the best answer is banning laserguns.

Similarly, using an uncensorable blockchain to violate contract or share unconsenting naked videos of people does not make those things ok. You may still be personally liable for doing so, even if the content can never be removed. 

If anything, the fact that the blockchain is uncensorable only *further increases your personal liability*.

&gt;Who cares what u think how utopia should look like?

Whoever said anything about ""utopia""? I don't think that word means what you think it means...

&gt;I'm talking about copyright as legal reality. 

So am I in many cases! But if you are looking at whether moral or legal axioms are correct and justifiable, you have to also look at the underlying principles. There is no other reasonable way to do so. 

Hypothesizing about how a completely voluntary system could work is one such way to do this, as it allows you to examine the underlying principles and axioms further.

Cause and effect; what causes Bitcoin from not being illegal to being illegal?,1526307480
"&gt;Your argument is the algorithm use the whole blockchain data.
&gt;
&gt;That is incorrect.

The difficulty adjustment is linked to the whole chain. Under the original schedule, present difficulty is a function of the previous difficulty and the duration of the previous adjustment period. It is a rather straight forward calculation. The current BCH schedule is likewise linked to prior difficulty, though more complicated due to its more dynamic nature and the need to account for the multiple changes in schedule.

I'm not assigning a positive or negative value to these facts, simply stating the reality. If changes to the difficulty adjustment schedule were warranted and healthy, then there should be no problem highlighting them as part of the changes BCH introduced.

&gt;And yeah it need to be changed increasing inflation shouldn’t be permitted in bitcoin.

Why shouldn't increasing inflation be permitted in bitcoin, so long as the fixed coin generation limit is maintained? 

Certainly the EDA was unsuccessful in this regard, but that has been addressed. However, during the EDA a common pro-BCH argument, and one I can find some agreement with, is that bitcoin's inflation is fixed and measured over blocks, not strictly days. EDA did not increase the inflation per-block inflation rate nor the absolute coin generation amount. Likewise, BTC's slower-adjusting difficulty schedule maintains the per-block inflation rate and absolute coin generation.

Why is it better that the difficulty adjustment should rapidly adjust? Does that better _compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time_ and does it better support the primary objective of bitcoin's proof-of-work scheme that _the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any competing chain_?",1526307464

"&gt;I think the gold metaphor is still very good. (The amount on earth is limited, it gets harder and harder to mine etc.)

Unfortunately, Satoshi overlooked one extremely important facet of gold production in constructing this analogy.

With gold, if demand goes down, so can supply. If costs go up relative to price, supply can go down.

This does not and cannot happen with any form of Bitcoin as currently designed, and so the price of cryptos is inherently less stable. When demand goes down, the same amount of new supply keeps coming out.

It's a flaw. Not a fatal one, but one of the many reasons crypto prices aren't as stable as gold prices.",1526306460

Look at the BTC volume to see if we are in an actual breakout or a fakeout. The price steadily rising on such low volume is just a tell tale sign that we were about to dump quick. 

Until new money comes in and sentiment starts to drift towards euphoria and greed, we will experience lots of red dildos. It just takes one. Keep a good watch on the volume. Without high volume, everyone is just out ponzi’ing one another.

I've heard of vertcoin only by name maybe once or twice in all that time.

Well, part of it is his English makes it very hard to read, but I didn't want to make a big deal out of that.

&gt;  I have studied CS

So have I.

&gt; Vertcoin has been ASIC free for 4 years, if it only lasts for another year, another 5, another 10, it was still worth it.

This whole discussion whether ASIC-free is possible or not seems to have confused you into thinking it's actually a desirable goal to be ASIC-free. It's actually not. That's the funny thing about scamcoins: they pick Bitcoin and pretend one of Bitcoins properties is a problem and then sell their shitcoin by saying that they have the solution. Usually it's not even a solution (as in this case) but the deeper truth is that it was never a problem in Bitcoin to begin with.

Our argument is that it is up to the user to determine the level of risk appropriate to their transaction. Part of it is that 0-conf has been used for a long time by people willing to carry the risk or employ services which mitigate it (there are companies specifically helping to assess the risk of unconfirmed transactions).

what i suspect is that bcash, like all other bitcoin forks / clones, will heavily rely on bitcoin core upstream codebase for their future scaling.

it wasn't really, there was times of congestion, just like with every kind of new infrastructure that is in the process of being developed. no need to risk a hardfork. and i have serious doubts about the legitimacy of the thousands of low fee tx, suddenly appearing in the mempool during bcash pumps. or certain economic agents refusing to make efficient use of blockspace while engaging in insider trading of bcash. i just don't buy into that story.

"Look, inflatianory currency has its pros and cons... just like deflatianory currency.. 

The way I see it, inflatianory has the advantage of accelerating economies as its similar to a loan in a way u can get more capital and lenders will lend u money cos they know u can repay it because of future cashflow... 

on the downside, just like taking a loan, u run on the risk of taking too many loans and getting too much in debt... and we all know how terrible it is to have bad credit..

Deflationory currency has the upside of not running into debt problems..  on downside, its slower...

Its the reason why I believe bitcoin and fiat can coexist together and create a natural balance...

Govt can run their fiat, and increase economic growth, which results to investors flocking in because it offers better returns than a flatting bitcoin (yes, it will flat eventually)...

But if the govt can abuse their power too much as if they run into the debt problems, investors would simply move out and return to bitcoin...

If BCH is adopted as an alternative to fiat money, lots of businesses, especially big ones,  are going to fire up their nodes, because it's just convenient to run their full/pruned/mining/non-mining nodes.  
Why? Because if you accept BCH as a small/medium business owner, you *may* want to run your pruned node as a proxy for your payment processor, who may need your collaboration to cut on their expenses.  
Because a large business would want to run their full nodes as a method to be sure their payment is accepted by the rest of the network.  
I agree with you that the protocol might be manipulated by these entities, especially the larger ones, but once they understand that is against their own good, they might not want to.

More adoption, more nodes, more fees.

"Gold and precious metals have a bit of intrinsic value. For gold, this is not as much as the price of gold would make you believe but it's something. Fiat has no intrinsic value and neither has bitcoin. But they are money systems, that when they work, provide utility and value for human beings. Take the euro for example. Great currency. Is accepted in a whole bunch of countries that decided to cooperate. But you can't directly send it on the internet and it's not a global currency. This is where Bitcoins enters human history. First money you can send directly from a computer to another computer. I know no borders. Its intrinsic value is still zero but the more it's accepted worldwide the greater its utility becomes. It becomes useful and if the network works, there is value in that. 

Which is why long-term Bitcoin Cash will have far greater utility and thus value then Bitcoin Core will ever have. Bitcoin Core is artificially limited money. Bitcoin Cash does not put an artificial limit on itself. The intrinsic value of Bitcoin Cash is zero but the more people believe in it, the greater it's usefulness for human beings. Same as with fiat. And it has a finite money supply. That's nice because our planet also has a finite amount of resources. The current fiat system has an infinite supply of money and requires an exponential economic growth to remain stable long-term. Which is impossible.

"Hey guys,

I'm a long time community member and I recently launched an online store that is completely centered around cryptocurrency.  I would love it if you guys would check it out and give me some feedback.  The website is:

https://tokenpride.com/


TokenPride is a celebration of all things crypto.  We sell cryptocurrency based apparel, gear, and furnishings.  We currently have 285 different products for sale in our store and we accept 59 different cryptocurrencies as payment.  We are rapidly expanding and increasing those numbers every week.

I'm really committed to helping grow this space, and I want to provide a platform for communities both large and small to display pride in their chosen crypto.  I've worked as a developer for crypto startups, and I know how frustrating it can be when a community wants to support a coin, but there is no gear available and no one accepts the coin as payment.  

I want TokenPride to be a resource for all new and emerging crypto communities.  If you ask us, we will provide original artwork and products for any coin regardless of the size.  We will also work to add your coin as a payment option in our store by building or integrating a payment processor.  We have recently hired some very talented artists and developers to help make this a reality.

Please take a minute to check out the site and give me some feedback.  Here is a list of all the currencies that we are currently able to accept as payment:

Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, Aragon, Bancor, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, Blackcoin, Civic, Clams, Dash, Decred, Digibyte, District0x, Dogecoin, Ether Classic, Gnosis, Golem, Matchpool, Komodo, LBRY Credits, Litecoin, Numeraire, Nxt, OmiseGo, Potcoin, Qtum, Auger, Reddcoin, RCN, iExec, Salt, Siacoin, Status, Storj, Swarm City, WeTrust, Wings, Monero, Ripple, Zcash, 0x, FirstBlood, Factoids, GameCredits, Lisk, Maidsafe, Monacoin, Omni, Neo, Nubits, Namecoin, NEM, Novacoin, Peercoin, Startcoin, Steem, Tether, Voxels, Vericoin, Vertcoin.",1526303776

"&gt; purpose of mining

Delay the creation of new blocks so that all Bitcoin nodes have time to propagate each block, and so that nodes with orphan chain branches have time to reorganise their chains  

&gt; mechanism to reward miners and inject bitcoins into the network

Miners do not need to be rewarded. For many years in the early history of Bitcoin, mining was a hobby which paid penny rewards  
Bitcoins do not have to be injected into the network by awarding them to miners. There are other options for creating new coins  

&gt; Prevent double spending

Double spending is not prevented by mining. It is prevented by Bitcoin nodes checking every transaction in every new block before adding a new block to the Blockchain  

&gt; In theory is it possible to have a crypto-currency without the requirement of mining?

A centralised cryptocurrency does not need to be mined  

Only decentralised cryptocurrencies are free from censorship by external forces - regulation and political interference  
To be decentralised, a cryptocurrency needs a large node network  
New blocks have to be delayed to ensure that the node network does not become irreversibly clogged  
Mining provides the delay which enables all nodes to keep their Blockchains synchronised",1526303737

i don't religiously adhere to the white paper, i do adhere to solutions that do not deter adoption and one of these groups seems more interested in that vs. religious adherence to a block size.

&gt; I didn't say you were interested, I'm just making a comparison in intelligibility of speech between the two.

and i'll repeat that you do not appear to understand audience.

&gt; If you're not willing to understand more complicated aspects of the tech then why are you incessantly talking about LN flaws? Perhaps you just don't understand it well enough to believe it's viable.

i understand the routing challenges at scale are non-trivial and you keep acting like they don't exist or don't matter or we already know what's just going to work perfectly to handle them.

&gt; That's fine. My comment about his dressing habits stands. It's a facade to make himself seem more credible and authoritative than he is.

you have some crazy obsession with dress.  as if the kind of internet geeks even watching this videos take some kind of signaling from the pair of trousers rick put on today.  i mean he's just some 46 year old euro dude wearing some slacks and a dress shirt.  you've literally commented more about his clothes than anything else.  if you want to point out someone else's critique of his claims then great, do so, but to say you don't have the time and then keep expounding upon your distaste for his appearance is quite comical.  maybe you are jealous because he owns more than 2 shirts and they aren't stained or something?  i don't know, it's pretty weird dude.

&gt; I guess we'll just have to see how it all plays out, huh? I'll put my faith in talented devs like /u/roasbeef, you put your faith in pseudo-intellectuals like /u/Falkvinge.

i'm not putting my faith in either.  i don't find rick's questions to be easily dismissed offhand and you've done little to offer up that you don't like his shirts.  i'm sure that guy is a super talented developer, but we are in early days of LN and it's not as simple as it will be once mature and who knows how well it will route things with a big monster graph while having to weigh in fees and liquidity and connections.  when will it be mature enough that it is simply a no brainer?  the longer it takes the more it appears BCH can gain on BTC.

You can buy as little as you like, it isn't like stocks that require you to buy a whole share.  Bitcoin can still (technically) be purchased for less than a dollar.

But, over the long run, it will have to rise to accommodate growing adoption.  Korea is on a program to go cashless by 2020 and cryptocurrencies (including bitcoin) are part of that.  Japan has moved forward with bitcoin in their everyday economy and will be hosting the Olympics in 2020.  Imagine travelers cheques replaced by bitcoin? The Asian markets are looking for a replacement of the USD based petrodollar and a bitcoin based crude oil market was opened for trading last fall.

"To quote u/DesignerAccount

I'm glad you acknowledge technological limits, which are very real. Personally it's the first time I see a big block supporter openly acknowledge this. And I'm generally even willing to accept Moore's and Nielsen's laws as valid for the forseeable future! (20-30yrs, that is.)

Thing is, tech limits trickle down to, ultimately, block size limits. At this point we can disagree on where this limit should be, and I'm more than happy to discuss this separately, but it is a limit that we need to accept. Long story short, I think where this limit is will depend on what you want the final system to look like - Potentially every user to be able to run their own node, or not. My personal opinion, or better dream, is that in 10yrs a ""mobile phone wallet"" should actually run a fully validating node! Download wallet, wait, say, 30min, get node fully up to speed. This is leads to the kind of decentralization that is absolutely immortal, and that's what I want. Or anything as close to this as possible.

As I said, separate discussion...

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;As far as new nodes taking months/years to sync up: yes that sucks but here are some thoughts on that: Some nodes might not care. They simply concider the sync time as a startup ""cost"" that they have to ""pay"" (by waiting) before going live. Peronsally I wouldn't care, I have no time constraint on going live for my purposes of running a full node.

For a business, this is very quickly prohibitive. I just don't see businesses kicking this up today, waiting for 3 months, and then up and running. What I do see, instead, as very awesome is a salesman walking into your local corner shop with a ~$300 full node to sell, which syncs in ~1hr, on a Sun morning before the merchant opens late, and then is good to go. Again, this is decentralization that cannot be killed.

&gt;Doing so is a bit of a compromise, because they **have to trust** that everthing up until `CurrentBlock - 100` is valid without performing validation themselves.

Highlight mine... and here lies the problem. If we are happy to compromise on the *completely trustless* nature of Bitcoin, then yes, life becomes a lot easier. This really goes to the core (pun not intended) of the problem - There are no conspiracies, just design compromises. You can't have it all, so you need to give up something.

Yes, if we decide that a ""partial trust based"" system is OK, then you are absolutely correct, bigger blocks will absolutely do. And again there is no right or wrong answer, just different compromises and different priorities people are making. You can probably guess my viewpoint, I'm not willing to give up *complete* trusetlessness, high fees be damned. In other words, I accept high fees as the price to pay to retain full trustlessness. And this is without compromise, which should make it clearer why ""small blockers are so irrationally stubborn"".

One of the arguments is, think I've written this somewhere else around here, that if you trust everything up to, say, `CurrentBlock-N`, you are relying on peers to feed you the correct UTXO set for `CurrentBlock-N`. With this premise, I can set up many nodes, say thousands on AWS, that randomly feed 100 different UTXO sets for `CurrentBlock-N`. At that point, you will not be able to determine very much, and you'll need to keep validating every single one of my UTXO sets and I'm not sure you'd ever get out of the mess.

In other words, a trust-based system can be Sybil attacked relatively easily. Which is one of the reasons I don't want such a system.

Note: I'm not saying this type of system could never be set up, perhaps as a mix of trusted+trustless. Maybe we could rely on actors that build reputation over time to feed us more recent data. But the key requirement, to validate the full UTXO set from scratch, remains. Or you're not in a mixed set up at all, but a trusted one.

&amp;nbsp;

Hope this clears the ""hard core small block"" position better. We're really not paid shills or Blockstream brainwashed sockpuppets. Much more simply, we're not willing to compromise on a few key aspects of the beautiful system Satoshi came up with, and are absolutely fine with all the consequences of this... high fees for on chain transactions first and foremost.

As an experiment, I spent the weekend doing a handful of trades (I've never traded anything in my life before, stocks or cryptos or anything else). Out of 10 trades, I made between 2% &amp; 3% on 7 of them, and three are still pending.

My question is : why are most people so against day trading? I understand my experience is tiny to mean anything, and maybe I just got lucky and that trading takes a lot of time. But, if someone starts with a dollar and does 100 trades in 2 years (one a week) at 3% a trade, it compounds to  approx $19 at the end of 2 years (1.03 to the power of 100). While 3% is probably hard in stock market (I have no clue), it seems possible in crypto, at least for the time being. This is not lambo money, but this is great for most normal people.

Anyone has done anything similar?

"How am I supposed to interpret ""bitcoin is going to make libertarians and programmers into wealthy elites"" and ""bitcoin is set up to be distributed in an egalitarian manner so that as many average people as possible can benefit""?

Do you think the average person is a libertarian or a programmer?

The central claim of the OP is patently false, the median person has 0 bitcoins. If the intention was to widely distribute bitcoins to the average person in the early days by flooding the market then it has failed completely. 80% of the bitcoins that will ever exist are in a tiny number of hands. Now even if the remaining 20% were completely evenly distributed the distribution would still be high inequal.

Why are people trying to bastardize the term ""egalitarian"" when they clearly don't mean it and don't even want it to be the case. They want and believe this currency will turn them and a small number of people into a tiny rich elite, simply because they got in first. That's the opposite of egalitarian.",1526299179

"&gt;Build it. If the market prefers it to Bitcoin people will use it.

""if you don't like it build something else"" is irrelevant to addressing the claim of whether distributing the vast majority of a currency in a single decade is ""egalitarian""

Regardless, I don't need to build it, it already exists, it's called fiat. Everyone, including bitcoin holders, prefer fiat for currency to bitcoin. One reason among many being you're not put at a 100,000x disadvantage because you weren't around when first dollars were being issued (which obviously the vast majority of people are never going to be because of how time works). Another being that since fiat isn't fixed supply there isn't an incentive to not spend it for years with the hopes of becoming a millionaire from currency speculation. So people actually use it for trade instead of just sitting on it while using another currency for trade.

&gt;But Bitcoin is completely equal opportunity. Anyone could have participated.

Including the people who weren't even born yet? Including people who live in a village with no internet and no electricity who haven't even heard of Bitcoin yet?

How do you think the opportunity to get 500 bitcoins from a few cents of electricity in 2010, and having to pay $8,000 in 2018 or $500,000,000 in 2050 all offer an equal opportunity? Do you think the person was born when bitcoin is at $500m has the same opportunity to become part of this ""new wealth elite"" as the person who got in at 6 cents?

Pyramid style distribution is explicity inequal in opportunity. Those who get in first have the greatest opportunity, that's the whole point, otherwise there wouldn't be an incentive for early adoption.

&gt;Because the power to create money without doing work is a power that no one should have and whenever it's been tried, it results in unspeakable evil.

Everyone has that power, the power to write an IOU. anything can be used as money.

"If Bitcoin becomes a widely used technology, then the current price is far too low to accommodate a large number of users. Since the number of bitcoins is limited to 21 million (and some of those are lost forever) and the total value of actively circulating coins needs to be large enough to accommodate the total economic activity, bitcoin has to have a certain minimum price. What price that is exactly, is unknown, but it's certainly higher than what we've got.

However, if Bitcoin fails to become widely used and either remains a niche product or eventually falls into disuse (either because cryptocurrency as a whole fails or because it is supplanted by a competitor), then it's very possible for the long term price-prospects to be very bleak. And in that case, the greater fool theory may apply.

"&gt; Over the years, there has been an increasing global interest among central banks and financial institutions. While some countries have created their own currencies, many more are looking into that direction.

"**Dark silicon**

In the electronics industry, dark silicon is the amount of circuitry of an integrated circuit that cannot be powered-on at the nominal operating voltage for a given thermal design power (TDP) constraint. This is a challenge in the era of nanometer semiconductor nodes, where transistor scaling and voltage scaling are no longer in line with each other, resulting in the failure of Dennard scaling. This discontinuation of Dennard scaling has led to sharp increases in power densities that hamper powering-on all the transistors simultaneously at the nominal voltage, while keeping the chip temperature in the safe operating range. According to recent studies, researchers from different groups have projected that, at 8 nm technology nodes, the amount of Dark Silicon may reach up to 50–80% depending upon the processor architecture, cooling technology, and application workloads.

Proof by example (also known as inappropriate generalization) is a logical fallacy whereby one or more examples are claimed as ""proof"" for a more general statement.

This fallacy has the following structure, and argument form:

Structure:

I know that X is such.

Therefore, anything related to X is also such.

Argument form:

I know that x, which is a member of group X, has the property P.

Therefore, all other elements of X have the property P.

The following example demonstrates why this is a logical fallacy:

"&gt; You are refraining from addressing anything of substance matter in the presentation, instead choosing to attack my appearance, specifically my clothing, while claiming I have no expertise in the subject matter which you refuse to address, instead spending walls and walls of text to divert toward my clothing.

No I'm not. Like I said, it's more to do with the air about you. You lend yourself tons of undue credibility and talk in a decisive manner, never qualifying yourself or your statements. 

&gt;Ironically, when you say ""who the fuck gets their initials embroidered on their shirt"", you display a complete lack of knowledge in the subject you're trying to divert to. It is quite standard for tailor made clothes to carry the initials (facing outward) or full name (facing inward, like on a jacket pocket) of the person they were made for. Initials cannot be embroidered onto that location after the shirt has been made, only as part of making it.

Anyone who thinks that's a classy look is clearly way too inward focused. 

&gt;So now you know. If you see somebody's initials on a shirt, don't say the shirt doesn't fit, because it was literally made to fit, and it was only made in one or two copies specifically for that person.

I'm saying the shirt accentuates your tummy, that's all. Also short sleeve button downs? Eh... Maybe that's a Swedish thing or something.

Anyway, you can't seem to address the critique that you're statements are blatantly false and/or uninformed. Statements like ""Bitcoin forked into to forks, a soft fork and a hard fork..."" are just the stupidest things I've heard in a while. What is this even supposed to mean? You realize Bitcoin has soft forked several times before Aug 1st, right? Do you even understand what a soft fork is? Clearly not if you're making such ridiculous statements.

I would also argue that the author's arguments about the alleged velocity of ETH reaching many multiples of cash is flawed. It will be a long, long time before the velocity of ETH surpasses cash.

"Yepp. So we have:Deflation \-\&gt; more default \-\&gt; assets vanish \-\&gt; big bad.

This is of course possible both with fiat and crypto, at least with fiat you CAN fight deflation. It seems like what we are discussing is whether an economy without lending would be better, not if fiat is good or bad. Lending enables you to go and do more with the capital you get and then pay it back, it gives you preaccess to things for a relatively low premium. For example I will most likely be paying of my mortgage until I retire, if I saved up money \(assuming stable housing prices\) it would take me decades to get enough to acquire a house.

The main critique of crypto \(mostly bitcoin atm\) from a macroeconomic perspective is that it seems to enable gains without your capital working, with fiat you are hit hard by the inflation if you decide to hold it for an extended period of time. 

I think fiat can be changed to something more modern, but as it stands it won't be done with a deflationary cryptocurrency.",1526290453

"That's the wrong way to use crypto. Just use a wallet like Coinomi:

* All the burden of managing those multiple addresses is done by the wallet, that's why a wallet is made for.

* You only have to carefully store your seed. A deterministic wallet can recreate all your adresses from that unique seed. So if you loose your wallet you don't loose your coins (they're still on the blockchain forever).

* Do not use Monero or any other untraceable coin. If you do legal transactions as a freelancer, you'll have to be able to prove where the money is coming from. Stay transparent for your tax administration. It's much better than doing shady things. It's even more profitable in the long run.

These are counterfactual claims. 

&gt;like leverage off chain solutions if it need be done to scale.

Wut? How does that align with ""original whitepaper p2p whatever""?

&gt;what i was really interested in were critiques of things actually stated and expressed in rick's LN videos. i would actually prefer your non-response to things like calling attention to his shirts though. i thought you were getting a poor shake in here after our prior conversation but your reputation to me currently is in decline.

My reputation with you? Hmm, okay. I thought about it and I don't really care how you perceive me. *Everything* Rick says is horseshit. He's speaking ELI5 every sentence, interrupted by (nervous) laughter because he knows as well as anyone that he's barely understands the very basics of how Bitcoin works. **Like I've already said several times, his conception of ""linear"" resource scaling is wrong**.

&gt;i wasn't interested in watching all of this or getting that deep in the tech. certainly there are still routing challenges as the end of the video states a proposal of some plans on how to handle them. this is a programmer given a lecture to an audience of presumably all programmers whereas rick is working on giving explanations to the layman. an audience distinction you seem to be completely ignoring?

I didn't say you were interested, I'm just making a comparison in intelligibility of speech between the two. If you're not willing to understand more complicated aspects of the tech then why are you incessantly talking about LN flaws? Perhaps you just don't understand it well enough to believe it's viable. 

&gt;you don't, and i don't owe you or your opinions any more than the dwindling respect you had earned prior which you are now doing a good job at destroying. i can't fathom how you think you would earn any if someone new stumbled into this conversation and saw you ranting about rick, his youtube channel's name, and his shirts like some sort of lunatic. i don't deserve my 10 minute rate limiting on r/bitcoin but after this thread i don't think yours is undeserved on r/btc.

That's fine. My comment about his dressing habits stands. It's a facade to make himself seem more credible and authoritative than he is. When he talks about something, it's always with the insistence that it's factual and not up for debate. He said things like ""this idea that full nodes are important to run is complete nonsense"" without qualifying the statement with something along the lines of ""oh, by the way, I'm not a developer or anything close so take what I say with a grain of salt!"" No, instead he just blabbers and blabbers like he's some sort of Bitcoin/crypto genius. I couldn't care less if you don't like the comment about the way he presents himself.

"&gt; You know inflation is by design in fiat currencies right? It's not a flaw.

Of course I know that this is by design, but in my opinion the design is flawed. Inflation is the process of devaluating the money. In this way you are paying for someone else's wealth. Your money becomes less valuable so someone else can have more money.

Sure the value of Bitcoin is fluctuating too, but this is not a design flaw. This is because people are using it (and even abusing it) as an investment tool. Once Bitcoin replaces the dollar with it's current dollar standard, the fluctuations will be much much less.",1526288018

"Yes, equilibrium stage BTC aims to be a store of value, and isn't now by the usual definitions. At least not  stable one. But you don't apply this same generosity to BCH as far as its use in commerce. And you seem to ignore the Fidelity Effect. 

Finally, despite it using the same ledger, its network effect in commerce had to start from scratch in August due to wallet-breaking changes it had to make due to it being the minority hashrate branch of the split. BCH is just getting started, and at ""equilibrium"" it can process *vastly* more transactions (likely 6 orders of magnitude more just following the normal design and operation of Bitcoin heretofore) without resort to a promised and unproven Lightning Network. ",1526287924
"Right. On one side we have a faction that is convinced Bitcoin as it existed for its first 8.5 years, and as specified in the [white paper](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin) is utterly flawed, and needs to get horribly mutated into something that has no resemblance to the original defining treatise. A faction that also pointed attempts to cheat the prescribed, Sybil-resistant mechanism for evolution documented in the white paper at ever turn. Yet this faction still desperately clings to the name ""Bitcoin"" defined by that very white paper. Where is the logic here? If their new ideas are so much better and so different from white paper Bitcoin, why not dissociate yourselves from the name that chains you to everything you believe is wrong about the original project?  

Meanwhile, on the other side, we have the cryptocurrency that among all other cryptocurrencies most closely follows all aspects of Satoshi Nakamoto's white paper, yet is principled enough to avoid the ""Bitcoin"" name at the time of the fork simply because they did not yet have most valid cumulative proof-of-work.  

However, once the BTC block chain passed block height 494,783 without adding the promised, locked-in and agreed upon 2x block size limit increase, it showed itself to be *invalid* per Nakamoto Consensus (in spirit, at the very least). Therefore, from that point forward, BCH is fully justified in officially claiming the name ""Bitcoin"" by every possible measure, as it is the **valid** SHA256 block chain with most cumulative proof of work.  

Shouldn't you be busy reducing BTC's block size limit to 300 kB?",1526287891

"i don't worship satoshi, why are you lecturing me?  the name seems fine, well branded as a revolutionary challenge to fractional fiat.  spending multiple paragraphs and effort complain about it seems petty and childish.

&gt; They did, obviously. Look at Segwit adoption. It's almost at 40%. That is a block increase, you dope.

it would have been trivial to have simply made a larger block size while working on other efficiency gaining measures in parallel.  i see no reason to believe the meaningful cost of doing so would have been above 0, meanwhile, stability/fees/adoption were all harmed by the path taken and even now it seems much success is pegged on LN delivering on future promises beyond what the complex and small beta footprint at present can deliver today.

&gt; Like what? Centralize itself?

like leverage off chain solutions if it need be done to scale.

&gt; Yeah, I'm not going to waste my time doing that, especially if you already know that he's giving an inaccurate description.

what i was really interested in were critiques of things actually stated and expressed in rick's LN videos.  i would actually prefer your non-response to things like calling attention to his shirts though.  i thought you were getting a poor shake in here after our prior conversation but your reputation to me currently is in decline.

&gt; Compare this with some like Laolu and the wide variance in human intelligence becomes very clear. Laolu is articulate and quick, i.e. a good speaker. Rick is slow and vague/obtuse.

i wasn't interested in watching all of this or getting that deep in the tech.  certainly there are still routing challenges as the end of the video states a proposal of some plans on how to handle them.  this is a programmer given a lecture to an audience of presumably all programmers whereas rick is working on giving explanations to the layman.  an audience distinction you seem to be completely ignoring?

&gt; I don't owe anybody a piece-by-piece rebuttal, especially in this case.

you don't, and i don't owe you or your opinions any more than the dwindling respect you had earned prior which you are now doing a good job at destroying.  i can't fathom how you think you would earn any if someone new stumbled into this conversation and saw you ranting about rick, his youtube channel's name, and his shirts like some sort of lunatic.  i don't deserve my 10 minute rate limiting on r/bitcoin but after this thread i don't think yours is undeserved on r/btc.

/u/Jarunik, an Ark delegate (sort of like a high profile miner if you're not familiar with DPOS), dealt with this recently. He was the canary in the coal mine for me - I even [commented about it on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Jarunik/status/985953941564395521) when it happened. Funny, right? Unfortunately, I didn't take my own advice at the time. Jarunik is a good guy and I very much doubt he did anything wrong, by the way. If his account got banned, that's alarming -- I don't mean to panic you or anything, but my suggestion is that you be smarter than I was and start moving your content off now.

I've seen several other crypto people making similar complaints on social media, such as [this guy](https://twitter.com/qsbk07/status/995500265552789505). I can't really personally vouch for him or any of the other randoms, though it is beginning to look like Medium has just started to ban crypto accounts at random or something.

[Bitgrail](https://medium.com/@Bitgrail) apparently got suspended recently as well. It was (is?) an exchange. I believe that there was some underlying drama here - some Nano apparently got stolen from their exchange - but I have no idea whether this had anything to do with their Medium suspension or not. My assumption is that someone complained and that this provoked Medium into eliminating the account without asking too many questions first.

Basically, this has all made me adamant that you shouldn't trust these people with your content at all.",1526286870

The BTC core developers were replaced/corrupted and they radically changed the design of the ""house"" to only have one doggie-door entrance and a promise to provide a teleportation port next door for getting into the house in the future. The tele port would be owned by a business that would charge tele-fees if it ever got built. They admit they don't want everyone to be able to enter the house through a door because they want their corporate owners to profit from selling teleportation services.

"Not surprisingly, this is poorly reasoned. 

The 'store of value' that Novogratz and others refer to is a stable store of value at *equilibrium*, not in its current speculative stage. The asset is just begin to burgeon. Yet, here you are mis-defining the value prop because you're willfully ignoring the fact that any emerging market is prone to volatility and nothing goes from zero to a million or beyond overnight. Markets are built, not wished into existence, which is what you're apparently attempting to do.

Segwit is a block size increase and it approaching 40% adoption. That alone gets Bitcoin at least 2Mb, which is more than enough for now. Beyond that is a mixture of additional chain upgrades, like Schnorr, along with HF block size increases. 

Compare that with BCH, which is currently processing minuscule numbers of transactions, with blocks routinely below 100 Kb. No wonder BCH lacks congestion! Nobody's using it and the block limit are about to be about 400x where it needs to be. It's beyond stupid to think that something that is currently processing the number of transaction Bitcoin was **5 years ago** is somehow a superior asset. Look at volume, TXs, TX value, price, etc. etc. etc. Everything looks massively weak, especially for something that shares the same 9 year history as Bitcoin.

Bitcoin promotes the ""be your own bank"" mantra, but lets face it: Most people do not want to be their own bank, nor do they have the capabilities to do so securely. Digital security is a complicated subject and most people don't have the skills required to properly secure their funds. This is where banks have a role to play.

Secondly, banks greatly improve the efficiency of lending and borrowing. These two things aren't going to go away and having a central point to mediate the two sides will benefit efficiency.

- ltc is designed to complement btc, not compete with it. It therefore less controversial than bch.

- ltc has a very strong track record in pushing technological changes (e.g. segwit, ln, fee reduction) quickly across its complete decentralized infrastructure.
- the abra exchange uses ltc as backbone currency, which is boosting its circulation.

This is so simple to prove. Before SegWit activates, every node can validate every transaction going all the way back to the Genesis Block. This is what allows trustless use of Bitcoin.  

After SegWit activates, non-SegWit nodes can no longer verify every transaction. In particular, they don't even see that SegWit transactions occurred, those are obscured behind the Anyone Can Spend hack. Furthermore, if they try to exercise their permissible right to spend the SegWit Anyone Can Spend transactions they encounter in the block chain, they'll find themselves forked from the SegWit block chain, even though it's quite likely they made zero changes to their client.  

You've spouted a bunch of hand-wavy, murky, and basically incorrect contentions since, but you've yet to dispute even a single aspect of my demonstrations of how SegWit can be seen to be a disguised hard fork, and *not a soft fork as claimed*.",1526285421

"&gt; why should i care what his channel is named?

Because it sounds like a fucking cult. Again, this is a guy who thinks that Bitcoin forked into a hard fork and a soft fork on Aug 1. As if that makes any fucking sense. This guy is a complete ignoramus and is clearly (barely) reading his points off of a prompt. ""We are all Satoshi"" just shows that he's attempting to appeal to people's emotions in this debate, which is just fucking retarded.

&gt;i ask your for critique and your first comment is apparently some poor attempt at an ad hominem?

That's not an ad hominem fallacy. It's a noteworthy title that makes absolutely no sense. Stop worshipping Satoshi. He was just a guy, one of many who've worked on Bitcoin. Stop worshipping someone who left the space years ago. He's not here to comment. This ""Satoshi's Vision"" bullshit is so stale at this point.


&gt;i don't know about BCH scaling on-chain forever - my primary beef with BTC is that they could have done it now and not resulted in adopting harming high fees and volatility.

They did, obviously. Look at Segwit adoption. It's almost at 40%. That is a block increase, you dope.

&gt;i think BCH will need to do what needs to be done when it needs to be done so they can avoid doing the same.

Like what? Centralize itself?


&gt;you didn't even take this opportunity to criticize faith in moore's law and across all these technologies keeping up, or show some maths to point out more specific potential bottlenecks; you essentially just ripped on the guy. you're not coming off as credible nor authoritative yourself and certainly not capable of rational critique.

Yeah, I'm not going to waste my time doing that, especially if you already know that he's giving an inaccurate description.

&gt;i thought our prior exchange was fairly civil and rational. but you're off the rails here, this is some weak shit.

Like I said, it's not even worth it in this case. Rick is such a bumbling retard that I can't believe *anyone* gives a shit what this guy says, even BCH proponents. His videos should each be about 2 minutes but he has to pause and laugh and look away and regather his attention every other second. Compare this with some like [Laolu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_szGaaPPFk) and the wide variance of human intelligence becomes very clear. I can barely even make it through a few minutes of this guy's shit. It's just monotonous platitudes and he's always either saying 1) nothing or 2) something false. I don't owe anybody a piece-by-piece rebuttal, especially in this case. You're going to have to seek that elsewhere (perhaps in the above comments as I noted already -- remember I'm not the only one who thinks he's talking gibberish -- look at the above comments).

"&gt; To start just look at Canada and United States. Many Canadians come to the US for health care, which is regarded to be the best in the world. No one goes to Canada for health care.

Why do many Americans come to New Zealand for healthcare though?

Public healthcare doesn't remove private healthcare from existence for those that have the means and desire for better treatment.

&gt; I'll also share a personal story. I live in a central American country that has both public and private healthcare and hospitals.

What country? I live in a country that also has private and public hospitals.

&gt; It's a totally private system with zero government involvement or government protections. So malpractice doesn't exist for instant.

Malpractice always exists. Doctors don't just not make mistakes because the govt isnt involved, they're human
 
&gt; I have the best health care anywhere and it's cheap. My doctor spends at least an hour with me anytime I want. That's face to face time with the actual doctor. Not a nurse or helper.

You claim you're from a central American country, I'm assuming not USA or you would have said that. You also claim USA has the best healthcare. But now you're saying that your country has the best healthcare. Not really following you. 

I too, can go to a good doctor, see them for an hour, yes the actual doctor, and it's cheap. 

&gt; I have my doctor's and my dentist's and my kid's doctor's personal cell phones. I call them anytime I want. We text photos of the kids if they had a rash. Many times they give advice and we don't go in. One time we had to rush to the hospital.

I'd also be able to do this no problem if I chose, however I'm 24 and have no kids and don't feel the need to.

&gt; Public health care is the worst. Super long waits and the government decides who gets care and who doesn't.

Umm no. The doctor/nurse decides who gets care. ie. if you have no medical problem you don't get care. If you have a medical problem you get care. People don't walk into hospital with a broken arm and get turned away because they have no insurance.

&gt;Another major factor that you see huge is connected people, family and friends move to the front of the line in a government health care system. Abuse is rampant and they have zero competition because many times the government will outlaw private health care.

Maybe in a fucked up, 3rd world corrupted as hell country (eg. USA). But not where I'm from. literally never heard of private healthcare being outlawed.

&gt; So I'd say corruption, long wait times, poor quality of care , and in general the doctors are not as motivated. Those four reasons but many others.

Corruption isn't an issue for us. Long wait times can be on occasion, but never for anything serious. You always have the option for private healthcare if you want. Quality of care isn't perfect, but it's acceptable. Doctors are motivated because they don't want to lose their ability to practice and their handsome salaries. 

&gt; And we haven't even gotten into the contracts. Private hospitals make contracts to save money and get the best. Governments make deals by who donated to which campaigners and then those guys get to staff the hospitals with their products.

So thats not true at all, and if you think it is, it's because you've been fed some bullshit by big pharma. Single payer healthcare systems are soooo fucking much cheaper than what a private USA hospital will pay for the same drugs. Our govt isn't fucked up and corrupted to the same level as USA so that favour swapping isn't acceptable here, people go to jail for that shit. 

&gt; The list goes on. I can't believe you're a socialist but into Bitcoin? Makes zero sense to me. Bitcoin is best invention of my life specifically because it gives power to the people and way from special interests, the connected, the powerful and the government. 

I'm not a socialist. However if you are what i believe a republican is, it's purely logical to adopt NZ's healthcare system.Americans are already PAYING MORE IN TAXES THAN ME FOR HEALTHCARE. And i actually get healthcare for my money. You're getting ripped the fuck off. So yea, the money is already there, just gotta sort out that corruption, and get yourself a public healthcare system. Because low income workers don't have healthcare as an option, they are less productive, it is simply and purely financially logical to provide public healthcare, even if you added it on as extra tax and ignore the healthcare money USA is burning for no reason.

Corralito (Spanish pronunciation: [koraˈlito]) was the informal name for the economic measures taken in Argentina at the end of 2001 by Minister of Economy Domingo Cavallo in order to stop a bank run, and which were fully in force for one year. The corralito almost completely froze bank accounts and forbade withdrawals from U.S. dollar-denominated accounts.

The Spanish word corralito is the diminutive form of corral, which means ""corral, animal pen, enclosure""; the diminutive is used in the sense of ""small enclosure"" and also ""a child's playpen"". This expressive name alludes to the restrictions imposed by the measure.

And that's disregarding the fact that BTC still exists, as do plenty of other alts. BCH should be under $500 per coin if not much lower. It's just a gimmick that was 'air dropped' to every gambler in the neighborhood. Seems that people will naturally trade a free dividend crypto. Who would have thought? Doesn't mean it has any intrinsic value. ",1526281639

"How can anyone consider that an OK situation? Especially for small alts it completely perverts the idea of POW, by giving a single entity all supply and consensus power. The opposite of what it's there for. 
And bitcoin mining being dominated by a single corrupt organization will keep causing more problems than we've already had.",1526281496

I think MUFG (Japanese Bank) was planing to do something like that but I am not sure what happened to the project. I personally thought it was a good idea to get people familiar to crypto but if you think about it it is just passing around an IOU so it is nothing different from the current system.,1526281460

The main ARK network was designed to be a payment layer for the entire ecosystem which is why we are focused so much on keeping it lean. Think about it like this. Say there is a sidechain that provides a service like audible and every month for $15.99 you get 15 ADBL tokens for your membership that can be used to purchase audiobooks. In that sidechain, if it is launched using our Push-Button Blockchain system, the Audible team needs to do absolutely nothing to accept ARK as payment for their service. They will have that ability built into the core layer. They can implement it using pre-built contracts if they implement ARKVM or they can implement it using pre-built Smartbridge Listeners if they don't want full VM (which in their case would just bloat their chain and isn't necessary for their purposes), or they could implement the ARK payment module that we will develop. Using any of those methods, ARK easily and on-deployment becomes a valid payment system for that service or application. Even though that service may use their own token in the app for unlocking features, ARK comes pre-built as a payment layer and requires 0 extra work on the part of the developer.

Now understand that the ARK team is 100% squarely focused on marketing and pushing ARK Blockchain Solutions to developers, start-ups, and enterprises once Push Button is complete as a go-to, simple solution for developing blockchain based projects and every one of those projects comes built in with the ARK payment layer. Could they choose not to accept it? I'm sure their developers could find a way to disable it if they really wanted to and as an open source project, I'm OK with that. But why would you? If ARK has value, liquidity, and is being used by an entire ecosystem, why wouldn't you want to tap into that?

Add to that the idea that every core application that the ARK Team builds will accept ARK natively and that we intend to continue to build out use cases for the payment layer, I hope that you can kind of see where we are taking all of this. Imagine if Bitcoin were really easy to fork and every time someone forked it for their project it had the ability to use BTC in the fork by default for payments without any extra work.",1526281302
"Jesus christ. New guys *actually* fall for it? You own BCH but \*not\* BTC? Sorry, but you're an idiot. Right now is probably one of the most important times to own two particular coins than ever before, probably in the ratio of the price. The most experienced minds couldn't guess this. But a new guy comes in, reads [Bitcoin.com](https://Bitcoin.com) and thinks he has it all worked out. Just...wow.",1526281219
