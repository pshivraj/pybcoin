"LOL, you're agreeing but then saying it will take 2-4 years instead??? 2017 return for $100 on each of the then top ten is $63,665. That's a 636x return in one year! (thanks mostly to Ripple.)

Even the worst performing coin of the top 10 (Maidsafe) returned 7x in 2017. If you put $100 in the S&amp;P500 25 years ago you'd have that same return for $700 now. 

The gains that were made in 2017 will never happen again in 4 years! Not even in 20 years. That time is gone you were either there at the time or not. If Crypto returns even 5x in the next 4 years I will be very very surprised.

Everyone needs to realize too that the gains in your crypto portfolio will at some point fall to a more normal 5-25% gains per year, in fact that time is likely already here as we're still massively down for the year.

People don't even seem to consider the idea that in 2018 the market might end up down, maybe at 50% of where it was at end of 2017, if that happens (and I think it's very possible) then we might not see a return to the end of 2017 prices for a few years, that's even assuming all the current top 10 survive that long, some will be gone, dead, and the rest will have to have excess returns to compensate for those complete losses.

"&gt; hence the resulting network is called Bitcoin Core. 

This has been called the ""bitcoin network"" since at least 2013. There is a section on wikipedia about it and it has been there for as long as I remember. What changed in the last 3 months?


&gt; In 2014 when code to increase the 1MB limit was presented to Core by the Core developers. It was rejected by the BS/Core team, systematical every developer who has expressed publicly support to increase the limit has been exiled from the team, ignored and had there code proposals rejected. Among them Joseph Poon the author of the Lightning white paper. 

Every developer was rejected, like 5 in total? Come on, this is politics, not an argument.

&gt; In 2015 BS/Core proposed we wait for Segwit before increasing the 1MB limit. There are no plans to increase the limit, ever. 

Don't be so black and white. Almost every developer supports an eventual blocksize increase. They just don't think it's the best approach now.

&gt; After 3 years of stalling on August 1 2017 those who supported removing the transaction limit took action, the resulting upgrade is known as Bitcoin Cash. If you don't support Bitcoin Cash, you are not supporting the removal of the 1MB transaction limit. 

Bitcoin cash is a minority fork, not an upgrade. The term upgrade is an opinion.

According to your logic, If i fork the bitcoin cash client and ""upgrade"" the blocksize to 1 TB, it is considered an upgrade worthy of the names bitcoin and bitcoin cash name. If you think bitcoin cash is an upgrade, run bitcoin cash, but don't go tell other people that it's an ""upgrade"". It is not. It's a minority fork.

"&gt; To achieve such a double spend you'd have to send a second transaction using the same inputs with a higher fee sent to other outputs (most likely one(s) you control) to a part of the network that is currently not yet aware of the original transaction.

You could also just send it straight to miners, who might practice RBF even if it isn't in the reference node software. Bitcoin miners were doing it before opt-in RBF made it into Core, and Bcash miners could continue doing it even with RBF not in the reference client.",1525067566
How so?  Do you mean that there will be new regulations/crackdowns against Bitcoin because of it causing an increase in carbon-based and/or nuke electricity generation?,1525067553
You're right about vaporvare. The real dark horse in crypto is Stellar. But the market can remain irrational for a long time.,1525067493
"Right now Bitcoin and other SHA-256 mining are approaching about 4,000 MW, with all other mining adding maybe another 1,500 MW. 

That's still less than 1% of global electricity generation, but since hashrate increases roughly proportional to price, a return of $BTC and $ETH to their all-time highs (roughly double from here), will mean there's potentially a doubling in the amount of electricity demand from miners.

Demand for an additional 6,000 MW would not go unnoticed -- especially since this demand would be concentrated in the areas where electricity is cheap (Quebec, certain parts of Washington state, Iceland, Republic of Georgia, parts of Russia, China, etc.

So there will be economic benefit from building additional renewable energy capacity for powering bitcoin and other crypto mining operations.   Solar is not a great match.  New dams can't be built quickly.    So what's left?  Onshore wind, and geothermal.  Onshore wind is not a fantastic baseload energy but in some areas the tall ones have turbines catching steady-enough wind that works fairly well for serving a Bitcoin mining operation.

Right now, Bitcoin mining is profitable even when paying $0.20 per kWh.  

Thus expect energy companies to get into the crypto mining space (i.e., vertically integrate) as well, ensuring demand for their expanded capacity of renewable electricity generation.

Perhaps.  It could be that coal and nuke plants ramp up to serve the additional demand from cyrptocurrency mining operations instead.  Who knows.",1525067350

"&gt;Both fiat and those numbers on a blockchain represent VALUE

No, they dont, neither of them. They dont represent value. In the case of fiat,   it gains value because  we have trust that most debtors will repay or at least service their debt. Thats why we are willing to exchange things of value for that debt. In the case of bitcoin, because we have faith others will want to own bitcoin. But that value is not what they represent; if we lose faith in a countries ability to service its debt, or we lose faith in demand for bitcoins, then their value collapses. It doesnt change a thing about how these systems work, or what they represent though.",1525066858

For starters I would really like you to actually put everything you have heard aside, including ""Bitcoin for banks"", ""Bankers coin"" etc. 

There are a lot of interesting facts you may not even know, e.g. the chain being as old almost as BTCs? some argue even older. Who is David and the role Jed played later formed Stellar. 

Start with: https://ripple.com/insights/ (A lot of great useful information and short videos)
https://xrphodor.wordpress.com/ (A very very good read, you will enjoy them)
Recent TD;LR articles for investors: https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/04/27/7-facts-you-didnt-know-about-ripple.aspx

Now I will summarise a few things for you as an investor.

Ripple basically works in payment settlements, the coin or Token XRP, 60% of it is held by Ripple, a centralised company. Only 40% is in circulation, rest locked up in escrow where 1 billion is released to ripple every month for private sales and some portions to sell public for funding the company and XRP further. 

Ripple has a few products, but XVia and XRapid use XRP, the fastest token on their ledger, whether crypto to crypto or fiat to fiat, or crypto, fiat. XRP on ILP will settle them the fastest. ILP so highly regarded in the industry right now that there are currently leaks of very big players also implementing it, although the settlement can use anything, even if XRP is the fastest. 

Products like XRapid source the XRP required via Market makers and then also on public exchanges(compatible ones, a lot being added). They always will settle on ASK meaning constant volume will keep the price steady if not in most cases driving it up. 

XRP basically is the liquidity solution, and we as investors hold it to sell on exchanges not just to others, but eventually to institutions that Xrapid and other products to come will be sourcing from. 

XRP is open source, and a proper crypto contrary to what anyone else says. It is getting COBALT update to do all transactions in 1 sec, has the highest TPS that matches VISA and will go beyond soon after COBALT. 

XRP needs just 17 more nodes to be more decentralised over BTC and ETH both. 

XRP will survive even if Ripple the company dissolves. 

All holders like founders are in contract and cant dump more than a certain amount a week, making sure value stays healthy. After all Payment solutions like Mercury FX just posted successful Pilot, Western Union, Money gram and others are still piloting. This is real adoption, not hype, not pump and dump. real companies doing real testing for something real to eventually happen, like production use. 

Ripple is currently targeting different usecases for XRP with payment providers and Banks are still the ultimate game, but since they don't just hype or do anything to pump xrp, they literally have 100s of bank partners that eventually might/might/might ask to trial XRP once the payment providers rake in the savings and show them it is legit. 

Ripple also wants regulations as their token is fully regulations compliant. They have an actual team of board members, directors, CEO, devs, architects, network engineers - you name it. Big big names they have poached.

Above makes it a very serious and legit project backed by a proper silicon valley firm with very experienced people from various industries that were poached. They don't even announce much, and silently just keep working and are partnered with some very big names, yet to be disclosed. 

XRP will and can not be created on the go by Ripple, all FUD. 100 billion is all that will exist, and every transaction also burns it. There is no inflation. There are no dumps, Ripple execs are the biggest bag hodlers if anything and so they also want it to work, while banks and other make money on savings, yes they will get rich too but can only sell so much every now and then. And us investors will get some little profits too. Thats better to me and more legit than anything out there, although I still hold Eth for its own usecase and to use it for payments once in a while. ",1525066851
"&gt; requires collusion with miners to do it

You just send the replacement transaction to them. Some might be doing RBF (some were before opt-in RBF existed in Bitcoin). Again, it costs nothing to try if so inclined, so the double-spender has nothing to lose by trying.",1525066793

Second example. If I also write a huge article about the cons of the Wunkel Engine without me being an engineer I also want you to fall into my trap. I won't discuss technological benefits with ignorant people especially with obviously biased ones.

"Double spending isn't easy without RBF, requires collusion with miners to do it, no one will risk their reputation on a coffee / something that is not majorly expensive.  And if it's expensive, can wait for a block, same as BTC",1525066593
"Translated:

Bitcoin prices rise for some reason, and Rulers of those living in France reduce their theft of crypto by 50%",1525066557
"Is anyone discouraging it? You can just download a client and run.

What people say is how useless it is for consensus and that this is a false narrative from bitcoin core.",1525066556
"Mining operators are competing globally, thus don't have significant margins.  They then need to run the equipment 24x7x365.  Solar gives electricity 8 hours a day or less.  So presumably this mining operation then would need to pull from the grid 16 hours per day.  

The peak period for the electricity grid occurs at about sundown until late-evening, so the electricity consumed by the mining hardware gets zero benefit during this peak period from the solar panels.

Solar really is not a good solution as a renewable energy source for Bitcoin mining, except perhaps when the solar generation is complemented with hydro electric generation.

Coal, nuclear and geothermal are good ""baseload"" energy sources -- those that provide at the same level, 24x7x365.  Geothermal energy, being a renewable source, should be what mining operators are looking at for expansion, not solar.",1525066527
"Since btc will increase in value forever, you have an incentive to convert all your fiat to crypto. But since you also need to pay bills, you are forced to do in btc because you have no fiat left.",1525066511
"Absolutely. There needs to be some dispute mechanism. PayPal offers this. 

In the early days of eBay, before PayPal, it was expensive to sell without PayPal in a way where buyer and seller were protected. I once sent with paypant on delivery where the delivery company (FedEx I think) collected payment from the buyer while delivering the item.

I think there is a solution using crypto. Smart contracts, trusted legal contracts, and other intermediaries may all play a role before this is mainstream. ",1525066450
"pets.com was overvalued in the dotcom bubble because people thought it could deliver a huge revenue. When it turned out it couldn't then the stock price plummeted. I would argue the pets.com moment of the crypto bubble was when Ethereum broke because of one dapp (cryptokitties). For me that was a wake up when I realized Ethereum was a looong way off delivering what people were expecting. After that point I dumped all of my Eth tokens that I know will be worthless in the future since multiple platforms won't be able to run on Ethereum let alone one. I also went balls deep on EOS since it seems like the only viable option in the crypto space for long term adoption. Maybe I will buy into Eth if they prove they can scale in the future but I think its going to be a while before they can even break 100 tps. 

Maybe they will scale over the next few years but I'm skeptical they will be able to catch up with blockchains that already have popular dapps running on them. Was the EOS crowdsale the pets.com moment or was cryptokitties? Is every blockchain going to go to shit or are a few going to survive? No one knows and you can use analogies with the dotcom bubble all you like but I would prefer to go with a logical approach and look at the fundamentals. ",1525066379
"Hmm, I see. So you don't think BCH should try to grab ""Bitcoin"" because right now Bitcoin's (BTC's) tech is flawed. Your thinking is calling BCH Bitcoin will make users confuse Cash's working system with SegWit BTC's broken one. I suppose that makes sense too.",1525066359

"&gt; This would be to their disadvantage because they'd be working on different transactions than the rest of the network which would mean a risk of creating an orphaned block.

The marginal risk involved in doing this is very, very small--the only difference is that they wouldn't be able to use compactblocks or something similar for block propagation for the transactions that other nodes don't have. You're allowed to include as many unseen transactions as you want in a block (provided they're valid), you'll just have to send them out with the block.

"Bitcoin does not need to change drastically from Satoshi's original whitepaper to succeed unless there is a reason for it. The problem with your argument is that Bitcoin Core hasn't actually given a valid reason to do so. Instead they used censorship, ad hominem attacks and propaganda to sway the community consensus into something self\-destructive. 

I'm all for Bitcoin adapting as needed... but a trojan horse is not an adaptation. It's a death sentence. The purpose of Bitcoin was made very clear in the news article contained in its genesis block. Centralized lightning networks is NOT in line with that.

"&gt;1. Means of Payment. Bitcoins are accepted almost nowhere, and some cryptocurrencies nowhere at all. Even where accepted, a currency whose value can swing 10 percent or more in a single day is useless as a means of payment.

It doesn't matter if cryptocurrencies are not accepted right now everywhere, but the trend tells us it will be the case in mostly few years. Actually, aren't they accepted almost everywhere in most advanced countries like Japan? You see those ATMs popping out everywhere?

&gt;2. Store of Value. Extreme price volatility also makes bitcoin undesirable as a store of value. And the storehouses — the cryptocurrency trading exchanges — are far less reliable and trustworthy than ordinary banks and brokers.

""If you can't handle my 50% swings, you don't deserve my 5000% profits"". Since blockchain is the most important technological advancement after Internet which introduced us to some fundamental things like trustless computing, transparency, anonimity, controlled emission of money, decentralization, lack of middle-men (fast and cheap value transfer), you already guess - it's much better than the store of value, it's value that rises while it's so obvious blockchain technologies are still tiny part of worldwide economy.

&gt;3. Thing in Itself. A bitcoin has no intrinsic value. It only has value if people think other people will buy it for a higher price — the Greater Fool theory.

Bitcoin has intrinsinc value and it's in all the power that miners use to valiadate transactions combined with will that Bitcoin is used. You don't need anything more than that for it to be what it is.

There are whole lot more misconceptions there in the article It's politically inspired and very shallow. Probably he wants to attract the crew which doesn't understand what it's all about to invest capital into his wealth management firm, and as such, that article was a great move.

"This question assumes I also have something *other* than bitcoin to spend.

Why would I hold more fiat than absolutely necessary?  It makes more sense to hold bitcoin and spend that since it's simply a better form of money in every way.

Essentially, you're looking at it the wrong way around and totally ignoring the opportunity cost.  Sure, that $2 coffee might have cost $40 worth of bitcoin at some point.  But equally, that $2 cash you spent on coffee instead *could* have been traded to bitcoin and increased to be worth $40 had you not spent it on coffee.

Either way, you wanted a coffee and made the decision to give up a certain amount of money for it.  That money - whether it be bitcoin, dollars, or something else - will change in value over time and could have been exchanged for another form of money anyway.

If you count every opportunity cost ever, then you're always losing out long term, which is a pretty pointless way to look at the world.",1525064225

"In your example wouldn’t XLM hold fundamental value and a “store of value” coin hold intrinsic value? 

I’ve been asking the exact opposite question. I can not wrap my head around why coins like BTC hold any value. Now that I think of it I can’t even comprehend how fiat holds any value... I understand that it these coins hold value because people agree on the given value of it. However, in this instance, at least fiat is tangible... BTC is for the most part imaginary, aside from the fact that miners produce it, and it can be assigned to a wallet, but even all of that is virtual. 

Non-store-of-value coins by definition have value, something for something. For example XLM is used to track and transmit transactional data. This data is validated by computers (more specifically computational power), which are essentially rented (via “crowd sourcing”). In order to acquire computational power the computer must expense both energy and computational capacity. Someone has to pay for the energy being sourced, and the computer has to give up computational power in order to validate the transaction and produce a product. Therefore that computer (and the owner) are compensated for their efforts in producing the product (aka confirming the transaction) and there lies the value of the coin. 

I’ve wanted to buy bitcoin for a while, and I’ve almost pulled the trigger a couple times, but there is absolutely nothing propping up the prices of “store of value” coins other than consensus and scarcity. I simply can buy it because if one of those variables (more so consensus than anything else) disappears, so does the entire value of the coin, and crazier things have happened!

"**Bir Tawil**

Bir Tawil or Bi'r Tawīl (Egyptian Arabic: بير طويل‎ Bīr Ṭawīl  [biːɾ tˤɑˈwiːl] or بئر طويل Bi’r Ṭawīl, meaning ""tall water well"") is a 2,060 km2 (800 sq mi) area along the border between Egypt and Sudan, which is uninhabited and claimed by neither country. When spoken of in association with the neighbouring Hala'ib Triangle, it is sometimes referred to as the Bir Tawil Triangle, despite the area's quadrilateral shape; the two ""triangles"" border at a quadripoint.

Its terra nullius status results from a discrepancy between the straight political boundary between Egypt and Sudan established in 1899, and the irregular administrative boundary established in 1902. Egypt asserts the political boundary, and Sudan asserts the administrative boundary, with the result that the Hala'ib Triangle is claimed by both, and Bir Tawil by neither.

"I see all crypto as split in two:

Coins - They have an intrinsic/store of value, and despite whether or not that coin receives revenue for the use of their services, reputation and speculation will drive the price. Even a coin like Verge, which will be utilised by PornHub - not sure if the latter are paying Verge to be able to use the coin, or if there’s a burn process involved when Verge is used, but the only thing that is driving the coin is the business profile. People won’t get a dividend on that coin from Verge even if they posted a trillion dollar profit. 

Tokens - used within a platform environment, have an intrinsic store of value, and maybe also have a burn process that increases the value of a token through dwindling supply. Might also provide a revenue return depending on business process. That’s why I’m invested in Power Ledger and INS Ecosystem. Huge markets and they both have:

Token escrow/burn
Revenue return (Power Ledger)
Intrinsic value",1525062217
"OMG, you're right!  They are burning part of their profits.  The actual quote is: ""Twelve percent of the transaction fees earned by the mining pool are burnt. "".   From a block they mine, they keep the 12.5 BCH block reward, and they burn %12 of the $9 USD worth of transaction fees.  That works out to be a staggering one dollar and eight cents.  Can you believe it?  They are burning a bucks work of BCH on average, from the transaction fees they collect.   A whole one dollar and eight cents worth of bch.  Gone. Gone for ever.  

Wait a minute, you thought they were burning the block reward as well, didn't you?  Understandable, because the article you linked, cleverly worded their description so as to give the impression that they were burning twelve percent of the block reward as well as the transaction fees.  Just as you did when you originally posted that they were burning their part of their profits.  It's sure is a tiny, little part of their profits.  Their profits are from the block reward of 12.5 bch.  The transaction fees for bch are lucky to reach ten bucks a block, it's nothing.  Certainly not like btc where transactions fees are often worth way more than the 12.5 btc block reward.   

They also: ""...call for other miners to join us in burning 12% of the transaction fees collected.""  -- not the block reward, the miners will need that to pay for the electricity, just the few bucks worth of transactions fees collected.  You could say it's more of a symbolic gesture.  A way to show investors that bch transaction fees are so low, they are inconsequential.

Cool.  Welcome to the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem :),1525059472
"Why BCH? Because it is the only project I know of that has the potential to survive, thrive and remain uncaptured, maximizing the outcome we both want in an intensely hostile environment. Bitcoin has just begun to be attacked. There is much worse to come.

Better devs? How do you measure or think this? I see no evidence for it. In any case, there is work to be done and people will do it. Devs are humans - not mystical beings with special powers. It took a good amount of genius combining multiple fields to put the original idea together and it will take all kinds of people to keep it alive and independent.

Better communities? Again, by what measure? I love the open nature of the BCH community and think it is well suited to supporting BCH in adversity. Don’t even try to compare to rBitcoin. I left that walled garden long ago and it looks worse every time I go back. Its masters have demonstrated they have no interest in the vision you and I discussed here.

XMR? Fluffy has too much influence for me to think that project can remain uncaptured. No single person can stand up to the machine. In any case, its transaction costs are and I think will remain too high for a global ledger. In addition to that, witness how the community went from warm fuzzies to rabid attacks with the x3. It shows fear and insecurity in addition to fighting a losing and I think meaningless battle.

VTC? Roughly the same.

Pump factors? It’s all still speculation until some coin achieves significant adoption so this is the case for every coin.

Roger? The oldest and arguably most effective cheerleader for bitcoin? Fine with me. Anyone can compete with his website, mining pool, services, etc.

Jihan? He is an enormous contributor to the space. I expect and look forward to competition in asics. Anyone is welcome to compete. He is still small fish compared to the tech giants who could step in.

Regarding special position, BCH has some part of the original Bitcoin’s network effect, just as BTC. That’s big. Also it is currently the simplest, most secure solution to an independent global ledger. I think it will decimate the field as adoption grows.

***All*** transactions on-chain is not feasible. But there is an absolutely enormous amount of room between 1MB blocks and any real technological limit. There is no honest reason for throttling on-chain scaling while it is still so incredibly underprovisioned. Some people think that having random people run nodes increases decentralization but that is a shallow view to me. POW does not care about observers.

LN is one of many possible second layer systems. It needs to survive competition and I think if it survives at all it will be in a niche for exchanges and crypto-banks. That’s a pretty huge niche actually but don’t even try to convince me LN can meet the general transaction needs of global generic usage. It will work better on BCH anyway so any success is support for BCH.

"You confusing terms here, what is almost instant is the transaction broadcast (the notification that a transaction is pending to the nodes for inclusion into the next block)

Then you ""transaction"" will remain pending for a few days before being dropped from the mem pool.

Essentially the biggest risk factor is that the transaction can be double spent, only 1 confirm and more can be considered a finalized transaction. 0 conf can be double spent. (Send the same tx back to yourself with a higher fee.)

Think of the 0 conf tx in mem pool as less a waiting list and more a possibility set where 1 or more possibilities for each input -&gt; output exists. It's not a 100% guarantee that the tx expected by the receiving party will actually happen.

"When it comes to money, there is no mechanism to force ""perfect fairness"" or ""wealth equality'""or ""equal distribution"" - that just isn't how money (a method of ""fair"" exchange between two individual parties) works (trade). To understand that you need to understand how trade works without money involved, such as bartering. Bartering is making a trade without money between two individuals. You exchange some things for some other things. 


Imagine if someone else stepped between two parties trading goats and fruit and said ""I think this trade should be more equally distributed"". That would seem preposterous because really it is. 


But here's the thing... if everyone or **most people ** hoard their money and never trade, some people due to circumstances outside of their control may not ever see or obtain any money, or enough to live on, they may starve and die even if they try their best to obtain money.  That sounds kind of ridiculous too... to anyone who is used to using money for trades nearly every day, but that is currently the unfortunate reality for millions on the planet even though things are gradually improving. But that's where the idea of basic income guarantee or unconditional basic income comes in, the idea is to create a mechanism not necessarily to force perfect fairness or wealth equality or equal distribution, but a mechanism to allow those individuals to have a foundational level of income so they still participate, so they can eventually trade and save and make financial choices where they otherwise may not have been able to. This is typically called more ""equal opportunity"" not equal distribution or outcome. The mechanism doesn't have to be unique to one currency. The distribution of a variety of currencies globally, if you are talking about global adoption of one currency, that is unlikely, because there will always be a vast variety of currencies, and they are most likely to follow some kind of pareto curve. The idea of a foundation income isn't unique to money, it is unique to people. Ubuntu. It is statement regarding culture and how we treat people who have no access to income. Do we allow them to participate in trade or the economy--- or not? The majority of studies have shown that people that don't have cash don't have defects in character, they are most often victims of circumstances outside of their own control. So we should allow them to participate.


Now, to really answer your question. There is no mechanism like that directly built into Bitcoin. But there are others already running such as [Manna](https://www.mannabase.com/?ref=ea4bef8b6c) helping people participate and escape financial destitution. However.... Bitcoin actually does have a mechanism for increasing the lowest level of wealth, it is called burning, and miners following the Bitcoin Cash protocol recently even did this. What happens is that some of the coins are burned/gone forever, making all the other coins more valuable. As ""Satoshi"" famously said, ""Lost coins only make everyone else’s coins worth slightly more. Think of it as a donation to everyone."" It is in their best interest for miners to sometimes do this if there becomes too much hoarding and not enough adoption/trading/participation... because that is when the currency loses value.

hence the resulting network is called Bitcoin Core.

In 2014 when code to introduced to increase the 1MB limit was presented to Core by the Core developers. It was rejected bt teh BS/Core team, systematical every developer who has expressed publicly support to increase the limit has been exiled from the team, ignored and had there code proposals rejected. Among them Joseph Poon the author of the Lightning white paper. 

In 2015 BS/Core proposed we wait for Segwit before increasing the 1MB limit. There are no plans to increase the limit, ever. 

BTC is defined by the 1MB limit.

After 3 years of stalling on August 1 2017 those who supported removing the transaction limit took action, the resulting upgrade is known as Bitcoin Cash. If you don't support Bitcoin Cash, you are not supporting the removal of the 1MB transaction limit.

The escrow is mostly there to protect you, the seller. 

So it works like this not just on LBCH but pretty much everywhere: 

1. Buyer and seller agree to trade. Seller puts coins in escrow.
2. Coin is frozen in escrow... if seller gets fiat, he pushes release, and the coins go to buyer for real.
3. If seller did _not_ get fiat after agreed time, he might initiate dispute with the site. If the site (usually human) finds evidence enough that buyer did not fulfill, coins go back to seller.
4. On the other hand, if fiat did go through but seller did not sign off release, buyer will initiate a dispute. Upon evidence site releases coins to buyer.

That's why I made the reply that I did. The one to one hashpower comparison isn't significant between XMR and XMC the way it is between BTC and BCH because of the differences in POW. It's true that XMC has more hashpower than XMR, but this is not significant or surprising. ",1525055924

That's false. Many outlets and people who understand that Bitcoin can, has, and will fork refer to it properly.

"The “majority of miners steal your segwit coin” is a hard fork. You are correct of course that soft forks are opt-in, etc... but once the soft fork is a “locked in” consensus rule, it requires a hard fork to reverse it. 

Ignore segwit for a sec and think about P2SH on BCH. It’s implemented as a soft fork. Now that it’s “locked in” a miner can not break the rule without causing a hard fork. 

I run the latest version of Bitcoin Core. I control coins locked with segwit outputs. It is impossible for anyone to steal those coins without my private keys, forever. My node and all the other nodes that enforce the consensus rules will ignore any attempt to do so, by any amount of the hash rate, because those blocks would be invalid and rejected immediately.

Since the coercive soft fork that forced Segwit onto BTC and the introduction of hard block size caps to BTC, ""Bitcoin"" in the sense of Bitcoin Core, the BTC fork, is using an entirely different design from Bitcoin. To that point using ""Bitcoin"" to refer to both the design and the implementation and the network didn't cause any problems, but now drastic differences between them have arisen, and the nomenclature must begin to reflect these differences for correct information to spread.

&gt; . Society has already decided what Bitcoin is and what Bitcoin Cash is

That's not how a market works. You don't get to just create an arbitrary cut-off line in time, based on your own preferences.

No, Bitcoin isn't some undefined idea. That's useless relativism, unsupported by reality. No one with any sense will claim ""Satoshi's vision"" is binding, especially me.

LOL. No. Do you even know what ""spectator"" means? Spectators are not participants in the network. The network could go on without any spectators, as in fact it did at the incipience of Bitcoin.

&gt;  It gets called of. 

No, you're breaking the analogy by trying to introduce a central authority, the ""league,"" which decides what is and is not a game or official match. That is entirely the *opposite* of how Bitcoin functions and how it was meant to function. Bitcoin proceeds regardless of external events.

&gt; And to argue that ""the network needs the miners"", is like arguing that a top league needs a couple of teams, when there are two divisions below it full of teams waiting for their chance to play in the big league. If miners leave, they will simply get replaced. They have every incentive to play by the rules.

There is a lot of attention, and a lot of eager expectation, but as far as reality goes the practical usability of blockchains has in some cases even regressed due to rising transaction fees.

I expect 2018, at least within the Ethereum space that I’m best able to speak about, will be the year of action. It will be the year where all of the ideas around scalability, Plasma, proof-of-stake, and privacy that we have painstakingly worked on and refined over the last four years are finally going to turn into real, live working code that you can play around in a highly mature form in some cases on testnets, and in some key cases even on the public mainnet.

"Look, it's not that simple, he thinks changing the core protocol into segregated witness/lightning isn't ""the real"" bitcoin, and he has a good point. I think the chain with the most hashing power behind it is the ""real"" bitcoin thus BTC.

That said, nobody is getting ripped off or scammed, if they spend $100 on BCH, it's not like they bought an off pair of jeans they can no longer exchange. In fact, most people new enough to not to know the difference between the two, are only in it for the gains. BCH has been gaining more than BTC, so if they get into the debate over which is the ""real"" bitcoin and decide to exchange for BTC they're probably in a better position to get even more BTC at that point. There's no way the court battle will work. Crying for ""victims"" that don't exist isn't a good look either. BCH supporters are out there right now, trying to convince people BTC's argument is weak, and they're resorting to censorship. Plays right into Roger Ver/Fake Satoshi's narrative if you think about it. But you're to blinded by us against them to see that.

The problem neither side can see is the vitrol, anger, trolling, propoganda ect. is a real turnoff to the newcomers. This lawsuit is a perfect example. If we're being honest here both sides just want the other to fail, has nothing to do with the poor no-coiners just joining the game now.

Some people are into the team sports thing and love choosing a team to wrap their own identity with. Most people into cryptocurrencies aren't into team sports and rooting for the local team. They're in this for profit, the technology, and anarcho-capitalist/libritarien beliefs ect. You think most of these people care about this two sided hissy fit?

I personally hold strong political beliefs that don't involve using the nanny state to get my way. Let the free market decide which they like better, trying to censor ideas you don't agree with is lame IMHO. I'd die defending the rights of shitty people I don't agree with to have shitty opinions.

On top of all that, there are better alternatives to both chains gaining market share. Sometimes you have to count your blessings and be thankful for what you have. Employing ruthless ""by all means necessary"" tactics in an effort to have it all, are a very poor choice if you're thinking long term. Didn't work when maximalism was en vogue a couple years ago, and this BTC/BCH war is making the problem worse.

Satoshi’s merely stating that the former is true, as we all know by now. That’s not to say that BTC and BCH can’t coexists, as they’re not two chains running in parallel within the same ecosystem but rather two different, incompatible coins.",1525048857

""End users can still validate transactions via SPV, which is completely valid and provable without storing the entire block chain. Consensus relay nodes can do the same thing, although they will start dropping off the network when the bandwidth costs become prohibitive. So in a small block system we have an extremely limited amount of space for transactions, which means the cost will eventually be excessively high and result in settlement between big players. That's the choke point that allows for KYC and AML. You can submit a transaction to the network, but you can't afford to because there isn't enough bandwidth to service your request so you are forced into regulated channels, onto exchanges, or through third party choke points that can be audited.

Gold has real world uses and a BTC transaction is literally thousands of times more energy intensive than Visa. ,1525048156
"A Merkle root/tree is just a hash, and that's not enough to ensure the validity of the underlying tx. Say you have 1BTC, and collude with the miner to spend 2BTC. That's, in principle, a ""valid"" tx, in the sense that unless someone rejects it, I can always change the balance on a ledger from 1 to -1. There's no ""universal law"" preventing it, it's just entries in a database. And you can hash it, and then stuff it into a Merkle tree... nothing prevents it. Well, full nodes do... but you can't tell just from the Merkle tree or hashes.

&gt;Also from the point that you bring up, leads me to think of another more depressing thought: is blockchain inherently unsustainable and guaranteed to eventually become impossible for new nodes to sync trustlessly

And this is it... the problem with Bitcoin's blockchain. It just keeps growing indefintely! The answer is, I don't know. As in, I don't know if this could be addressed. Maybe we'll just be forced into some sort of semi-trusted setup where we all just assume that before `CurrentBlock-N` everything was OK. The problem is not an easy one to solve, but here again small blocks help *tremendously* - It just gives us more time. Let's say we have ""1 ExaByte of time"", in the sense that once the blockchain exceeds 1EB it's game over, we just cannot do anything anymore. If use 1MB blocks, then I have quite a lot of time to think about it and find a solution, if it exists. But if I drive at a full speed of 1GB blocks, or more, then I'll get to the end MUCH faster, and maybe I won't be able to find the solution in that time. Point is, small blocks buy us a lot more time to research everything and find solutions.

&gt; It seems to me that unless bandwidth increases to infinity, then for any blockchain to be indefinitely sustainable, you must eventually cut it off at some point and just say everything before this point is valid and I'm not going to interdependently validate it. It this true ?

Absolutely. But maybe there's a way out, in the sense that one could completely validate the UTXO set without starting from the genesis block. I don't know if that's the case, and I'm not really too convinced it can be done, but if there is, it'll take us some time to get there.

&gt;edit: also I commend you for truly putting ideas out there and fostering real policy discussion in this sub. Even though its much better than r/Bitcoin, it is still often a pretty toxic echo chamber of a very specific set of ideals, that I think your response challenges in a well thought out way. Every time I even remotely hint that miners shouldn't be blindly trusted without validating at least some signatures and coinbases for yourself, I'm downvoted to oblivion.


I don't think r/bitcoin is bad when it comes to discussion. It's obviously a bit of a circlejerk, but that's inevitable for every community you may wanna consider - People who don't agree with the prevailing view are kicked out. The thing is, r/bitcoin has well defined rules and it enforces those rules unapologetically. I have myself been ""micro-banned"" (a day or two, can't remember), and had posts removed, but am not raw at all. I actually respect the mod team more for it! I understood what caused the ban, and did not repeat it. Happily discussing there now.

But when it comes to BCH... there's a special place in the moderation policy for it - Absolutely zero tolerance. And this is not so much for the disagreement of scaling approach, it's more because of the people involved in BCH, and the undeniable social attacks on Bitcoin. From Roger going to CNBC shitting on Bitcoin, to the absolutely obvious pump of BCH the day before his appearance on Alex Jones' show where he claimed BCH was growing more than Bitcoin for months. (Even this community called him out for that!) And, of course, the misleading on bitcoin,com which some pissed off people are now trying to get to court for.

"I don't know how much miners spend on PoW daily (electricity, etc) to secure the Bitcoin network - so I am gonig to just pick $4 million.

My point is you cannot get around paying that to the miners - unless you want the PoW for Bitcoin to reduce.  If miners are spending $4 million a day for solving the difficulty puzzle - that $4 million *has* to come from somewhere.

If most people are doing off-chain tx, then the times when you do on-chain you are going to have to make up for that.  

So it seems to me, the low-volume transactions are subsidizing the high-volume guys.  That is, the miners still are getting paid $4 million a day, but the guys who exchange 10,000 transactions a day are only paying for the handful of transactions to open/close/refill.  And the users that do 30 transactions a month pay equally for the same few handful of on-chain transactions.

Anything can be faked.  You first would have to find evidence that they ARE faked.  And somehow have been faked for years.  And also that /r/Bitcoin numbers are not faked.

You can't and won't do any of that because conspiracy theories can't stand up to real world scrutiny.

"The point the article left out is that the lack of this sort of market supervision, coordinated with the exchanges, was one of the key reasons the SEC denied the ETF in the last exchange:

&gt; C. Basis for Disapproval   

&gt; The Commission has, in past approvals of commodity-trust ETPs, emphasized the importance of surveillance-sharing agreements between the national securities exchange listing and trading the ETP, and significant markets relating to the underlying asset.  Such agreements, which are a necessary tool to enable the ETP-listing exchange to detect and deter manipulative conduct, enable the exchange to meet its obligation under Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act to have rules that are designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to   protect investors and the public interest.    

&gt; As described above, the Exchange has not entered into a surveillance-sharing agreement   with a significant, regulated, bitcoin-related market. The Commission also does not believe, as   discussed above, that the proposal supports a finding that the significant markets for bitcoin or   derivatives on bitcoin are regulated markets with which the Exchange can enter into such an   agreement. Therefore, as the Exchange has not entered into, and would currently be unable to   enter into, the type of surveillance-sharing agreement that has been in place with respect to all   previously approved commodity-trust ETPs, the Commission does not find the proposed rule   change to be consistent with the Exchange Act and, accordingly, disapproves the proposed rule   change.

"Utility tokens.
 A utility token can be defined “to represent future access to a company’s product or service”

An example of a utility token is the Basic Attention Token (BAT). the BAT token functions as a medium exchange between users, advertisers, and publishers who participate in the Brave browser ecosystem. Advertisers purchase ads using BAT tokens, which are then distributed among both publishers and browser users as compensation for hosting the ads and viewing them, respectively.  Advertisers would need to be able to decouple themselves from the price of BAT to consume the utility of the attention economy,  thats where MARKET Protocol smart contract would come into play.  Dow Jones Media would be able to determine the price that a derivative contract would settle for x amount of time into the future until they are done running their marketing campaigns.

 Siacoin main purpose is to account the use of data storage.  A company that has offices around the world and has plans to use SC decentralized cloud storage for x period of time, can make a derivative contract on the ETH blockchain using any ERC20 token to have fixed exposure to SC and consume the utility of data storage.  This is why we feel as though MARKET Protocol will be an essential part of the crypto ecosystem,  because it allows the space to evolve where the 90% drop or rise in the price of SC has no bearing on the business owner who’s main aim is to use data storage.   Imagine you needed to hedge your Siacoin that you own as a business to consume their platform, if you have to lock them, you cannot use them, so hedging is pointless.  But with MARKET protocol, you would lock collateral (either a stable coin or maybe ETH) and hedge your SC that way.  So you have now decoupled price from utility.  Which is what an airline does with their exposure to fuel prices (for example). and is a very important feature of derivatives in the business world.

Stores use NCASH tokens to incentives more frequent visits, increase in store purchases, and increase brand loyalty/retention. Nucleus’s retail partners obtain NCASH tokens and reward customers, those customers can use the tokens across the Nucleus ecosystem or exchange them for real cash. The customer can earn additional NCASH tokens for giving data to the merchants.  These sum up the utility of what NCASH provides to merchants.  The truth is that brick and mortar retailers need this tech to be able to stay competitive with their ecommerce counterparts,  but those merchants would need to be able to decouple the price of NCASH to have a fixed annual budget and to ensure the cost of the token doesn’t exceed the utility associated with owning the token.  If a retailer plans to take advantage of the the benefits of NCASH for lets say hypothetically a 5 year contract,  it would bode them to know exactly what the tokens they will be purchasing would cost,  well as we know there is plenty of volatility in crypto. MARKET Protocol allows merchants the ability to hedge the price risk associated with owning the token, while maintaining custody of NCASH token and consuming the utility of procuring shoppers and their data.

What about the porn nympho that is addicted to only special XVG purchased pornhub,  well that person just may not have the attention span to create a smart contract to ensure the price doesn’t exceed the absolute crucial utility!

&gt; Two days after we received the notices of all of these closings of various accounts, I received a call from a woman who introduced herself as an employee of the Bank of America MSB Control Center.

Bank of America decided that it is likely (or not worth risking) that the government would determine that this guy is running a money services businesses without the proper licenses. The bank would be risking large fines if they did business with an unauthorized MSB.

Here is a great article (from the same website) which explains this much better than I can:

A very relevant part of this article is that according to FinCEN:

The article has lots of other interesting points which should make it clearer.

It is not relevant that the daughter's account had no crypto transactions. They closed ALL of his accounts at bank of america (including the custodial one for his daughter).

The point is to be part of a decentralized payment system and, for that to happen, cryptocurrencies' basic units' value in USD/EUR is irrelevant as long as it's stable enough to encourage actual spending. That's where Bitcoin, for example \- though it holds true for all of them \- needs to improve. As long as its price stabilizes, though, and it certainly will, sooner or later, it doesn't matter if each one will be worth a million dollars or half a dollar, it will actually behave like a currency, adoption will increase and, because of the limited supply, it is unlikely that they will be worth less than they're worth now.",1525046048

Well, of course everybody will say BCH is orders of magnitude better, but for me the real thing triggering coming to BCH was charlie lee. Although I never held LTC beyond one single trade I've made to scalp some few bucks, I used to have some sympathy towards LTC.

After all the toxicity and insecurity manifested in charlie's tweets towards BCH, I started to dig:

1 - ltc development is fucking non-existent, all they do is copy&amp;paste blockstream and core;

2 - charlie lee is **done**, after he sold all of his stash with ludicrous excuses, everything he did after that only hurt LTC, litepay, lite[insert anything] whatever were so fucking ridiculous scams, it is embarrassing;

3 - those are only two main points that show LTC is nothing short of pump and dump social media scam;

4 - now look at BCH: it has far more mining structure, more market, far lower fees (I've sent hundreds of thousands paying 1 satoshi), *many* entrepreneurs coming to it, much more development teams, more wallets, more ideas, more community, more everything. This is the play where crypto is actually happening, this is why it attracts so much hate.",1525046041

The real question you should be asking yourself is, _""if Litecoin is getting the Lightning Network, why not just use Bitcoin?""_

Litecoin is basically a testnet for Bitcoin. Charlie Lee (the creator) is best buddies with many in the BTC development team. Litecoin was the first coin to implement Segwit, and now is going to implement Lightning. But bitcoin is already doing all of this stuff. It is a useless coin in my respectful opinion. I might also add, Charlie Lee sold all his Litecoins during the top last December. BCH on the other hand has many of the original, long-time community behind it.

"Yes Bitpay was so concerned over fees that they never bothered batching their transactions or deploying Segwit in a timely manner. Those 2 things alone would reduce their fees for customers by over half. Bitmain paid them millions of dollars, that's why they support BCH. During last December when fees were their highest, Bitpay and Coinbase were both sometimes charging their customer 5-10X fee they needed to get in the first block (as well a purposely avoiding Segwit and batching to help lower fees). Because Coinbase and Bitpay do so many transactions they forced everyone else to outbid their insane fees causing a feedback loop of even higher fees. This with the price of bitcoin quadrupling in a couple of month is one of the main reasons that caused fees to get so crazy. They helped create the problem to feed their own agenda so they could push Bcash as the solution. This is the same reason Bitmain spammed the Bitcoin mempool and pumped Bcash the second the difficulty adjustment happened for Bitcoin to pull hash rate from Bitcoin to further slow it down. Again create the problem so they can push their own coin as the solution.

I'd like to know why you are so focussed on bitcoin cash. It is from adoption point of view just another altcoin, just look at txhighway.com. Other alts have better tech and better adoption, and also much better (friendlier, more constructive, more pragmatic) communities and better more capable developers (e.g. LTC, VTC, XMR).

So I do not share your viewpoint about the meaningfulness of bch. The ""pump factor"" is particularly high in case of BCH due to singular players that act as gurus and eco system drivers (roger, Jihan), i.e. centralized elements. I think you should see this.

Just because BCH has the bitocinb ledger history in common with Bitcoin (up to mid 2017)? - That's too little to justify giving BCH a special position. After all, many Bitcoin forks exist.

"&gt; Yeah that's exactly what I said. It irreversibly changed the protocol without a fork, by changing the code of the reference client. That is why I said that the core developers have absolute co trol over the protocol. They can make changes without allowing miners the opportunity to follow the other fork, because they cleverly write their code in such a way that there is no other fork to follow, and then they market that with the term ""soft fork"" which sounds nicer even though it's more Machiavellian, and use the marketing term ""hard fork"" as a villian because it sounds dangerous. And gullivle people fall for this and believe that so called soft forks are somehow better when really they are subverting the process of the nakamoto consensus.

This is patently false. The whole *hard fork versus soft fork* distinction comes down to whether the changes are backwards compatible. Segwit is a soft fork, it doesn't require changes to consensus rules to implement. 

Not sure where you're getting your info from but it's completely wrong. ""Soft fork"" is not a marketing term and soft forks *are* better because they don't break mining/node consensus, not sure how you can honestly claim otherwise.

&gt;I mean yeah it's down from the all time high but... Bitcoin is down from its all time high vs $ too. ATH isn't the bar. The general trend is upwards and BCH is enabling new use cases, like memo.cash, Cointext, and being able to use it for small payments. Recently the price vs Bitcoin is rising, but that's not the metric most BCHers care about. They care about usage which I admit is low but I believe it's also rising.

I said the **ratio** is down from ATH, not the fiat pairing (which is also way down from ATH). The general trend is definitely **not** upwards. Again, you're claiming something that is just objectively untrue. Not only is market volume for BCH completely in the shitter (which is an embarrassment given that it benefited from 8 years of existing network distribution before genesis), it *also* is [processing less transactions than Segwit addresses on BTC](https://blog.bitmex.com/the-segwit-transaction-capacity-increase-update/). There's literally no way for you to spin this as BCH is suddenly becoming more useful, relevant or valuable. All metrics point towards the opposite conclusion. 

Please stop with this subversive astroturfing. The ""facts"" you're citing are not facts at all, they're falsehoods. If, ideologically, you support BCH for whatever reason, that's fine but to claim that the metrics are positive is just a complete falsehood. Again, volume, ratio, transactions, etc. all paint a very different picture than what you're claiming.

Here's one of them: https://youtu.be/yXFuNkaYcPQ",1525043943

"bitcoin and ethereum where the first major players and to a lot of people that's the only coins they have heard of, so when joeblow who seen bitcoin on the news is going to be investing in bitcoin as oppose to some small altcoin. That said there are several newer coins that are instant and free or nearly free such as NANO and IOTA, and there is constant innovation and tons of new and improved cryptocurrencies. There is a lot of money and powerful people behind the current central banking system that benefit from keeping it in place. Mass adaptation of cryptocurrencies by world government would be a huge blow to them. However governments are really starting now to take notice and regulate and adapt cryptocurrency in one form or another. There are also tons of big name companies currently working with to implement cryptocurrencies. You cannot stop the future though and massive adoption of blockchain technology is inevitable, and this is still in its infancy so this level of doubt is natural. I do seriously see this in the long term as the death of the central banking system.",1525043930

Bitcoins provides a service in that it provides value transfer services and record keeping.  It even pays its expenses to miners for security.  Though to be fair, buying Bitcoin tokens aren't the same as owning part of the Bitcoin company and is instead speculating on value of assets of the company.  But I would argue that not all speculation is gambling unless you broaden the definition of gambling to encompass all investments.

These types of arguments just seem to boil down to semantics.  Investopedia says the difference between investing and speculating is based on the risk involved, but there is no way to quantify the risk involved in investing in Bitcoin so in that sense it comes down to your perspective on how much risk is involved I guess.",1525043788

"IMO the first step clearly is learning to code.

Where and how to start is a matter of belief.
Most recommend going with an easy language like Python or Java (even though I really wouldn't call Java that easy if you try to learn it properly).

My approach is different, yes you do get fast results, but you will miss the depths. I spent the past couple of years teaching students at my university basics of coding and mathematical algorithms in both Python and C. Even though the classes using python didn't struggle as much as the classes that had to go with C, the difference would become highly visible in the following semesters, where the people that learned C outpaced the people that learned Python by far. So my clear advice is, start to learn the basics and go with C. Try to understand how a computer works, how memory is allocated and communication inside a computer works. I highly recommend going with Kernighan &amp; Richies ""C Programming Language"" and give yourself a couple of weeks to go through it. If you got C, move forward with C++ to delve deeper into object orientated programming.
By then you should be able to understand code well enough to read the code of other crypto projects and get an understanding of what they are doing, or at least trying to do. ",1525043219

However you can not dismiss the use cases of blockchain tech by grouping the whole space according to blockchain, that’s just ignorant. Ether definitely has fundamentals that are tied to value, so does Stellar, Tron, Deep Brain Chain and a vast majority of coins. This is a new concept and there are a lot of scams and shills, but you’re approach is fundamentally flawed.

Yeah that's exactly what I said. It irreversibly changed the protocol without a fork, by changing the code of the reference client. That is why I said that the core developers have absolute co trol over the protocol. They can make changes without allowing miners the opportunity to follow the other fork, because they cleverly write their code in such a way that there is no other fork to follow, and then they market that with the term ""soft fork"" which sounds nicer even though it's more Machiavellian, and use the marketing term ""hard fork"" as a villian because it sounds dangerous.

But if we are talking about a true cryptocurrency, it is clear from the position of the SEC that we will be talking about ""security"" tokens.  This is still an awkward fit, as a crypto coin does not give you ownership in any share of the assets of some company, in this case a developer entity, as would a share of a traditional security as in the form of stock in that company.

In other words, when you hold dollars, for example, you not have some interest in the Federal Reserve Bank as a business entity, or some other government agency.  You are trusting them not to dilute the circulating supply of what you are using for exchanging value with other people, a trust which is often misplaced.

"Wow never knew my PhD comes in handy more often then I anticipated.

OP you're on the right track. Allow me to add into it.

If there are any exchanges that are *washing providers* it is **OKEx &amp; Huobi**.

Why?

OP covered most, however in most secerities laws it tends to take more to find grounds on washing trades. Now I understand the nature of this market is *decentralized*. However, investors deserve equality. Yet these two exchanges use the tac-tik *give and take*. They can be literally giving you almost anything and considering the amount of speculation, it doesn't take much to satisfy the average investor here. 

Lets rewind a little. **OKEx &amp; Huobi** both opened new companies since China started to crack down. They also put on a new cover, but only with a little tweak. Add more faces in the media and more pinned-entities and you got yourself a puzzle. China's laws are no joke, so outside of the crypto ban, when it comes to corporate incentive in market trading they will use full force due to economic detoriation. 

So they left and made new companies elsewhere, more faces and pinned-entities. What are these pinned-entities. If you take a deeper look, for example Huobi has its own token. This is the gateway to all manipulated volumes, mostly when there is an incentive that no one knows about. 

Remember I mentioned corporate incentive? Yes that is the exchanges token. They can utilize it for value, volume, and volatility. The 3 V's. In some counties that exchange is actually violating laws even outside of the securities, such as gambling acts. The broker (exchange) has a funnel that could potential used for their own good as an incentive. Now this excludes Binance, because their token is used in a completely different model and is not just a trading-token.

These scemes tend to show *give and take*. For example, at a investors perspective: Here you go we just gave you hundreds of new cryptocurrencies just like you asked. The take is happening as all the investors are becoming *satisfied* which is manipulating values and volumes. Here is an example from a public regulatory point of view: Regulators come after Huobi, and they say if we were hiding something you would see it on the blockchain. That is the reason we don't have Monero on our exchange. Now yes that sounds stupid but it isn't because to regulators it sounds like they are keeping their doors open but we all know that is not true.

Here is the take away. If you think USDT is bad, think again. They are feeding and assisting these two exchanges. They're on the same scale. The high level regulators probably know about it and if one day it all goes down. They'll just say we told you and you'll start to see more fiat pairing at that point. ",1525041221

To function to its full potential, the bitcoin network must not only provide an avenue for transactions, but also remain secure. By using a number of randomly selected nodes, the network can reduce the problem of double spending - when a user attempts to spend the same digital token twice.

However, bitcoin doesn't just need nodes, it requires lots of fully functioning nodes - nodes that have the bitcoin core client on a machine instance with the complete block chain. The more nodes there are, the more secure the network is.

Hell other ERC20's don't even know what to do to get their coin working so they give it to you in wallets and say ""we are working on it...just use the ERC20 for now"" - in ICX's case that token swap was due Q4 2017.

It would be better in my opinion to make behind the scene consensus on what a good watchtower is. (kind of like how consensus rules work on the bitcoin network.) Say for example someone makes watchtower software, but adds an incentive (the node operator can choose an amount to charge nodes it guards) but for the node to get the reward, it must announce what transactions it is guarding. If other nodes detect that things went wrong while be guarded, they announce it along with proof. As a result the bad watchtower is rated badly, and loses its reward for that transaction.

Over the years I have taught myself, by searching for the answer to any question I might have had, and often having to beat my head against a wall for an answer when all I could find were other people crying about the same issue and only clues about the actual solution.  You haven't really started computer programming until the first time it takes you 8 hours to find a missing semi-colon that causes the syntax of the program you are working on to blow up in your face, but I'll warn you that's how it starts.

Having said that, this is certainly a gold rush boom area of technology.  I suggest you start trying to learn C++.  Just search for learning C++ on line and you'll find various resources.

For accuracy, there's is a way to double spend a 0-conf transaction but it is reasonably difficult enough to pull off, so some merchants agree to take this small risk.

To achieve such a double spend you'd have to send a second transaction using the same inputs with a higher fee sent to other outputs (most likely one(s) you control) to a part of the network that is currently not yet aware of the original transaction. If this second transaction gets mined first, the original transaction will be rejected. Even if these miners get the first transaction after the second one (and before they have mined any), they will have an incentive to mine the second one (higher fee). RBF makes this even easier to pull off, this is exactly why it is recommended to wait for 6 confirmations (RBF or not) for any transaction of moderate/high value.

Just to be clear, I consider that advertising 0-conf as a secure feature, like certain Bitcoin Cash supporters do, is deceptive.

Aka. 

No science. 

Ideas proposed need to be criticized freely without the need for alternative solutions. Otherwise no ideas can have its faults made apparent. 

You need to invent the internet to criticize phone lines, but you can't invent the internet if you don't know they problems with telecommunications. 

This isn't how criticism works. 

If an idea cannot withstand criticism it is the fault of the idea not the critic. 

To prevent criticism is to create propoganda and echo chambers. It is to deny the semblance of rational thought. 

If someone is going to stand on a soapbox and pretend Bitcoin isn't an archaic idea using modern technology then they deserve to have to answer to why they are pretending it isn't the case.

Blockchain technology is fundamentally one of the greatest accomplishments in computing science. The ability to have unreplicable digital tokens is something far beyond what we originally thought might ever be possible. 

The technology has only scratched the surface of its use. 

But nothing about crypto currency apart from blockchain is original. There are numerous criticisms of these types of currency schemes. To prophess their greatness in absence of these long standing criticisms is to be intentionally dishonest for your own purposes. 

You don't stiffle criticism you answer it. If you can't answer it you are wrong.  That's just how it works. If you lie be prepared to be called a liar.

Certain figures in this article use scientific notation for readability.

In economics, hyperinflation occurs when a country experiences very high and usually accelerating rates of inflation, rapidly eroding the real value of the local currency, and causing the population to minimize their holdings of local money. The population normally switches to holding relatively stable foreign currencies. Under such conditions, the general price level within an economy increases rapidly as the official currency quickly loses real value.

"Disassociate the concept from the dispute between implementations and user communities. The problem that that Bitcoin solves for - namely establishing the reliability of a shared, distributed ledger without reliance on a trusted administrator (individual or as an elite class) - is _best achieved_ when implented through the application of a majority work source. The confidence that such a system affords, as described in the  eponymous white paper, _relies_ on that system using a majority work source. As that system's chain _must_ come from a majority, of which their can only be one, only one 'thread' can accordingly be considered a complete implementation of the concept. As long as two otherwise-incomptible implementations share a compatible source of work capacity, only the one which establishes dominance through the accumulation of work proof fulfills the attributes described by its inventor.",1525037178

They already own the biggest BCH wallets that exist. If they sold their coins like normal miners do, Bcash price would plummet because their is no real demand for it. After the fork the price dropped down to a low around .05 and Roger Ver, Jihan Wu, Calvin Ayre and their other billionaire buddies accumalted more coins for several months at this price. Then they bought even more coins with their failed super pumps in 2017 trying to fake demand. Now that they control most of the liquid coins on the market they can easily manipulate the price. Just look at the charts since Bcash forked and you can see it doesn't look like most charts. Most obvious is back in 2017 when they would pump the Bcash price on the exact same days of Bitcoins difficulty adjustments in their attempt to draw miners away from Bitcoin to Bcash. ",1525037140

how does the peace treaty effect bitcoin LN?,1525036862
Craig is contributing to Bitcoin Cash.  What is your contribution?,1525036826
"For court cases under a governmental jurisdiction, there may be a ""standing"" issue if no one is particularly injured (so there is no case in controversy, strictly speaking). 

But, for ICANN, I think a class of people, who can swear they mistakenly thought bitcoin.com and bitcoin cash was Bitcoin itself, that may justify removing the domain from the owner. 

For twitter,FB, telegram, and other private social media, that would depend on their own terms of service, but I would think this is sufficiently misleading that the relevant usernames/accounts could be suspended.

The name ""bitcoin"" may itself be generic, but it does refer to a specific thing -- the data that constitutes a ""bitcoin"" unit of value. 

This is analogous to a geographic designation -- like Roquefort, or Champagne or Sonoma (a wine area). Product producers from those areas can stop others from applying the name as being ""geographically misdescriptive."" A consumer would be confused that the product is from the designated area, with those qualities. Particularly, an unsophisticated consumer who is targeted is likely to be confused. 

Designating a cryptocurrency with the designation of a confusingly similar well known cryptocurrency is similar to being ""geographically misdescriptive."" It is **""cryptographically misdescriptive.""** 

The end result is the same:  Consumer confusion as to source. In this market, with sophisticated producers in an unregulated market, for a technically dense and new product, it is particularly egregious to target unsophisticated buyers, and there can be no doubt that it is with the intent to confuse.

Therefore, your honor, I'm shocked and outraged at this blatant attempt at **cryptographic misdescription** designed specifically to set a trap for unwary unsophisticated consumers. 

Just like labeling some delicious sparkling California wine as ""Champagne,"" no matter how delicious the wine, it is not from the Champagne region of France, and this is geographically misdescriptive. Some may say the California sparkling wine is attempting to free ride off the reputation of the sparkling beverages from the Champagne region of France. To label sparkling wine from California as ""Champagne"" would be **geographically misdescriptive.**

Just like the California sparkling wines can stand alone, and may even be better than Champagnes, so it is with Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Cash may be valuable. It may have advantages. But it is not Bitcoin. Some may say that Bitcoin Cash is free riding off of the reputation of Bitcoin. And to label it ""Bitcoin"" is **cryptographically misdescriptive.**

And the proof is real. These plaintiffs have all come forward with declarations under oath that they have been so confused. All intended to purchase ""bitcoin."" All knew the risks involved with cryptocurrency value. They were not confused that they were purchasing a conservative store of value. That is the risk they were willing to take.

The risk they were unwilling to take is that they would be three-hand-montyed into purchasing something totally different. They were confused that Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin, that BCH is BTC, that what is promoted on ""bitcoin.com"" is bitcoin. They were duped into purchasing bitcoin cash by intentionally confusing promotion. 

This is not to say that bitcoin cash is not equivalent to ""champagne"" or that it has no value. The true value of bitcoin cash is irrevelant. The only relevant point is that the purchasers did not get their bitcoin, they got something else.

"I made the following comments when this was posted in r/ethereum: 

He's repeating the same line that has been shouted at every turning-point in the history of human civilisation, in which a new technological, economic or social development has provided a means for productive forces to bypass the mediation of traditional political institutions. This is literally the contemporary version of the guildsman's scepticism of bourgeois industry. 

The whole rant amounts to little more than the observation that crypto remains reliant on a non-blockchain trust-mediated world. ""Because blockchains can't do *everything* within 10 years of inception, they are useless!"" A joke-argument. Obviously the blockchain isn't capable of doing everything now. These are technological developments, which take time. It took Visa and MasterCard 50 years to get to this point—and even they were built on the back of other charge-card systems. 

Moreover, he consistently misunderstands that in this context, ""trustless"" only means deleting one or more previously necessary trusted third parties. Obviously, deleting the financial institution previously required to mediate a transaction between two parties doesn't entail deleting *all* trusted third parties involved in mediating any market exchange. The author is either a moron or a sophist. 

Anyway, after 10 years the potential of blockchain is clear to anyone that looks. So, I'm betting with history on this one.

"&gt;  If a node crashes due to storage exhaustion

Well, there is a big difference between the implicit limits in UTXO set size and block size. 

A rogue or clumsy miner can create an oversize block by himself, with no cost other than the cost of miniing. if different miners have different notions of what its the max block size, and the majority of them accepts the block, those in the minority would either crash or will be sent off in a branch with less PoW. 

The same damage could be achieved by growing the UTXO set until a sizable minority of the miners either crashes or rejects the next solved block.  However that seems to be much slower, if not more expensive; isn't that so?  With a 32 MB block size limit, how long would it take to double the current UTXO set size?  If it is slow enough, miners can see it coming and upgrade in time.  

If a rogue miner (or user) can indeed damage the network by rapidly inflating the UTXO set, even with a 32 MB block size limit and (say) a 100 kB transaction size lmit, that would be a flaw that needs fixing.  I have no idea how that could be done.  Placing limits on UTXO set growth would only freeze the whole network once the limit was reached.  

One thng that could help would be to charge the tx fee only on outputs, not on inputs.  That would not open the door to spammers, since each outputs and inputs are paired 1:1 -- thus charging 2 sat for each output and 6 sat for each input will ultimately give miners the same revenue as charging 8 sat for each output and 0 sat for each inputs.  But it would make it much cheaper for users to consolidate the crumbs and dust in their wallets, while making it much more expensive to spam-bloat the UTXO set,  (And that would also satisfy the business sense rule that the client should be charged for the value that she gets out of a transaction, not for  how much that transaction cost to the merchant -- especially if she has no control over this cost.  A bitcoin user has control over the outputs of his transactions, but not on the number of inputs.)

Another decision that may help is to add to the protocol a mandatory minimum output value.  Say, any transaction with an output smaller than 15000 sat is invalid.  The limit can be changed when needed by a hard fork, like the block size limit.  Then smal-clogging the UTXO set would require locking a substantial amount of money (although the spammer could get it all back in the end).",1525035748

"&gt; So why do you guys think that expanding the blocksize is better than Bitcoins current LN? I know its not perfect, but it seems to be a more permanent solution to solve this issue.

The Lightning Network does not even work. They have not solved any of the key problems. Additionally, even it it were ready, it would still need blocks of well over 100 megabytes. I would encourage you to take a look at this short video, which explains the problem quite well: [link 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYHFrf5ci_g)

Bitcoin originally had a 32mb blocksize, with plans to increase it as needed. The 1mb limit was only supposed to be temporary, and some of Satoshi's last posts were specific instructions on how a blocksize increase could be safely done. He never intended 1mb to be permanent. Basically the refusal to increase the blocksize was a _political_ one, not a technical one, as this post explains: [link 2](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/informative_btc_vs_bch_articles/dl8v4lp/?st=jaotbt8m&amp;sh=222ce783)

&gt; but expanding the blocksize seems to be a bit shortsighted since at some point the amount of transactions will cause the same problem again.

First of all, there are things being worked on. Proposals like graphene would make transactions about 90% smaller, and that is just the beginning. Bitcoin core never mentions this. Secondly, as I often tell people, Bitcoin Cash is not _against_ two layer solutions. This is another myth. Lightning is not part of bitcoin; it is a secondary feature being built to be put on top of bitcoin. Think like a luggage rack for a vehicle. Monero has even talked about implementing LN possibly one day. But we are years away from anything like that being ready. In the meantime, banks/paypal/other coins/etc are moving in rapidly. Time is of the essence, and there is no reason not to increase the blocksize significantly. Again, the problem was political: [link 2](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/informative_btc_vs_bch_articles/dl8v4lp/?st=jaotbt8m&amp;sh=222ce783)",1525034924

I don't advocate for the preservation of the 1MB limit, where did you get that from? Why are you even bringing this up?

&gt; you do know how ""consensus mechanism"" works in bitcoin? building block on top of blocks - the metric we measure how to do that is PoW i.e. Hashrate.

That is one mechanism yes, but there are more. Suppose that advances in mathematics make SHA256 obsolete and bitcoin has a POW switch. According to your definition this new coin cannot be bitcoin. According to my definition, if the majority agrees that this new coin is bitcoin, then it is.

Anyway, you're just killing your own point. If hashpower defines consensus (which I disagree with, but lets just suppose that for a moment) then it's blindingly obvious that bitcoin cash is not bitcoin.

I don't claim authority over the BCH name. I'm just following what every exchange, every news website and every book does. The road of least confusion. Who gave you the authority to change the definition for no good reason? Do you realize that the people who are trying to change bitcoin cash into bitcoin, are the ones who came up with the name bitcoin cash in the first place?

"&gt;if we're arguing that only miners need to run full nodes

_I'm_ not arguing that.

&gt;it's implied that they may have the necessary resources to create an alternative chain.

If they have the resources to create an alternate chain, they don't need to knock the other miners off the network in the first place. They can just orphan the honest minority.

Sybil attacks are not of limited utility for lack of an ability to execute them; it is no harder to sybil massive numbers of non-mining Bitcoin nodes than it is to do the same for any other P2P protocol. Rather, sybil attacks are ineffective because PoW can't be faked.

Projects funded, I meant more chance for non-accredited investors to invest in startups.  
  
Autonomous corp would not BE on the blockchain, bitcoin allows a program to own money. For example, one could put a PC in the middle of a field, weather proof it and power with solar and battery. Hook this computer up to the internet with a satellite internet connection. The computer is running a paid for service, weather that is a VPN/Proxy, remote storage, or an runs arbitrary program. This service provides the computer with payments in bitcoin. This bitcoin goes to the internet bill as well as general maintenance. When the computer has a problem or goes down, a backup of a Rapsberry Pi board sends a signal to a company to come out and fix the problem and the bill is paid once the system gets back up.  
  
So the theory is that once the initial setup is done, it should be able to run by itself continually. Basically it gives a system the ability to own money and pay for itself.  
  
Now yes the people who started it up still technically owns the PC and the setup, but if they die or declare it abandoned it just keeps running and making money and fixing itself. That was the basic idea with that. Maybe it makes no financial sense at the moment but that could not have EXISTED before bitcoin was introduced.  
  
Bitcoin will not rise forever but the idea is it deflates. It is not going to see huge % swings 20 years from now as it does today. But it will beat storing value in an inflationary currency. Yes that money should be invested but I think it's nice to have a currency that doesn't have inflation backed in by default.

Bitcoin is a sound investment because you can get out as fast as you got in, theres no third party charging you for the privilege of holding the asset, there isnt a small army of dubiously skilled accountants, lawyers, estate agents, banks and surveyors between you and your investment...its just you and your cash.

"&gt; Yes they do say that about stores of value , only a fool would put all of their assets into one pot. Just because something has the name store of value it doesn’t mean it can’t loose as well as gain. Property, gold, bitcoins, stock ect ect ... have all lost and gained.

Diversification isn't the same thing as something being a store of value.

Store of value has a specific definition and function that isn't just ""don't put all your money in one thing"".

Bitcoin isn't a store of value, its a highly volatile speculative asset, that's why people say ""don't invest more than you can afford to lose"".

If it was honestly a better store of value than fiat, why do you think merchants refuse to keep any money in BTC and instantly convert to fiat? Surely everyone would be keeping their money in BTC and only converting to fiat when they needed to.

&gt;As for influence on markets, I meant more over that gold and diamond markets and oil markets are over produced at time to drive down the price, hence they limit supply, this does not mean that the supply is so scarce as people believe. On the BTC side it is scarce period and that supply can’t be manipulated by design. You have mis interpreted my words. All markets can be manipulated by price, BTC can’t by supply unlike all the ones I previously mentioned that can.

Fixed supply makes it easier to manipulate, not harder. That means if you buy up lots of bitcoin, price is guaranteed to increase because supply can't increase to compensate, and if you sell a bunch of bitcoin, price is guaranteed to decrease because supply won't decrease to compensate.

This is why its so volatile and so prone to speculation. ",1525031830
"An implementation will have an ultimate limit on the size of the UTXO set, or if no pruning on the total size of the block chain.  This is given by the amount of storage available.  However, even this limit is not *theoretically* needed of implementations take a suitable approach.  If a node crashes due to storage exhaustion this is *prima facie* that the those responsible for releasing the implementation are incompetent at some combination of design, coding and/or testing.

The other resources needed by a bitcoin node are bandwidth related, including network, processing and I/O.  However, these limits do not depend on the block size, unless the node is required to keep up with the network in real-time.  The required real time performance depends on how far behind the node is to be backlogged.  If a node is slow it will know how far behind it is, based on the longest chain of headers and can report this to its users.  This will depend on network traffic, and not the actual size of  a particular set of blocks.

Miners will have a stringent set of real time requirements if they don't want their blocks orphaned.  Similarly, merchants selling high value items for quick delivery to potentially disreputable customers will also need fast nodes.  Others will have less stringent requirements and can afford cheaper hardware and network access.

Because the actual limits hit by competently written node software come down to real-time constraints which will be probabilistic due to unpredictable real-time performance, the entire concept of a hard limit on block size is mistaken.

&gt; Transition to a monetary system that is not based on ever-increasing exponential growth with its exploitation of human work force and natural resources of our small space ship earth, but instead a sustainable way of living together. I'd hope that a limited and in tendency deflationary monetary system free of outside manipulation can help in such a paradigm shift.

 &gt; Depends how you define ""p2p electronic cash"". Anyway, this sort of thing will happen, with or without Bitcoin, we know it already now, this is unstoppable (except by totalitarian laws with strict and brutal enforcement).

&gt; If not Bitcoin, then BCH or LTC or VTC can do that (edit: or stellar, [iota probably not] or another future coin).

1000% agreement (except I believe it would only be BCH or a future coin)

&gt; I think LN is an excellent way to realize the vision of p2p electronic cash, in complement to a blockchain. It is part of the overall scaling concept. Decentralization is paramount for a p2p electronic cash system, if you want to call it like that. So recoding each coffee purchase on a global ledger is not an option (unlike what many/most bcash shills say). 

We disagree deeply here from multiple angles.

&gt; Part of the p2p cash system will be alternative coins that come and go, e.g. some will become centralized and than lose in value and lose adoption, while others pop up. Alternative concepts like ""tangles"" will come up, then people will find its deficiencies liek centralization and reliability problems, and yet other methods will come up. We are only at the beginning of that process. The best decentralized p2p cash system is in the process of being found.

Full agreement again.

&gt;  In the meantime, Bitcoin must rely on its core competence, which is decentralization, reliability, and credible sustainable scaling strategy. If Bitcoin gose the short-term way like bcash, it it doomed to fail because it won't be able to compete with one of the other newer coins.

Full disagreement again.

Yet investing in an insurance company wouldn't qualify as ""gambling"" to buffet since it is a company yet it produces nothing which does qualify as gambling. Contradictory.",1525029279

"I know plenty about Bitcoin. That's why I hate it. I hate commodity currencies. I hate private currencies. The model for crypto is a choice between the two of them. Either you have flexibility controled by a private entity with incentives that generally dont line up with the needs of the users, or you have an inflexible commodity currency whose value is incredibly vulnerable to manipulation. 

We have thousands of years of development into currency systems. Crypto likes to pretend that it's the next evolutionary step in currency but the reality is it's simply a digital commodity using new versions of previous currency ideas, that rolls back on numerous improvments to currency and pretends its advancement. 

Crypto wants decentralization. 

Not recognizing that centralization is necessary for regulation and stability. 

Not realizing we have had decentralized commodity currencies in the past and they regularly destroyed economies overnight. 

Not realizing that their inherent technological model solves towards a mining monopoly.

Not realizing that they still create a private currency controled by an organization. 

Its a psuedo libertarian wet dream to have money without government. But the reality is governments only got into the money trade to stabilize it because it used to be a fucking shit show. 

Crypto wants to be considered a currency. 

Despite having a value that fluctuates so rapidly its nearly impossible to transact without change in value. 

Despite having base values that aren't feasible for transactions without ridiculous subdivisions based on fractions of value determined by the comparative price to a real currency. 

Despite horrendous transaction times, excessive power consumption, extremely complicated handling, ridiculously restrictive management, and a very unlikely chance of ever being supported by basic POS systems. 

Despite the fact that it will never be used to issue a loan by a bank because crypto is designed to hate banks. Which is important because fractional reserve banking is how currencies primarily increase their money supply without minting all of it. 

Crypto wants high value and rapid growth. 

Despite high value being purely in the interest of investors at the expense of its currency applicability. 

Despite literally no form of economics supporting the idea that an economy with a base value 900x higher than par is a good thing as opposed to a currency closer to par with more currency on circulation. 

Crypto is a commodity currency controlled by private ""Goldsmiths"" who benefit from having a stock tradable commodity rather than a currency. Crypto has no inherent use outside of being a currency. As such crypto becomes this hommonculus which pretends it has currency value so that it's trading doesn't tank but behind the scenes the crypto is attempting to increase trade value rather than actually make it a currency. 

This is digital gold without the real world uses for gold. 

Gold is no longer a currency for a reason.  

Its a speculation stock masquerading as a currency. ",1525029201
"Wait as second, so are you saying that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value? If so, the only reason to buy it is the hope that the next guy will pay more which is how you end up with a Tulip Bubble.

They don't say that about stores of value.

If its safer to keep your money out of a store of value, then your money is a better store of value than the ""store of value"".

Stores of value are literally the safest place to store your value. Hence the name.

&gt;you will find gold, oil, and diamonds and other are highly susceptible to market manipulation, all mined substances until BTC came along can have their mining increased or slowed, meaning they can influence the price at will.

yeah, no one is manipulating the price of bitcoin.

bitcoins price is as stable as the algorithmic nature of the supply command, its completely steady as the math that underlays it.",1525029119
"Comprehension skill are lacking in those that advocate for the preservation of the 1MB transaction limit. 

&gt;&gt;Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in the chain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash.

&gt; Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.

I'm still not convened you understand how bitcoin works: 

&gt;Hashrate does not define what bitcoin is, consensus defines what bitcoin is.

you do know how **""consensus mechanism""** works in bitcoin? building block on top of blocks - the metric we measure how to do that is PoW i.e. Hashrate.

&gt;BCH is a well-defined financial asset, and it's not defined as ""Bitcoin BCH"". 

who defined it as something other than Bitcoin BCH, and what gives them authority to do so? 

&gt;Bitcoin core did not decide that, the market did.

The market had not concluded if Bitcoin Core's 1MB limit is good or not, both Bitcoin BCH and Bitcoin BTC are still competing in the market. We do agree the market will descried, we don't agree the market has not ruled on a decision. ",1525029100
"&gt; what, if any, effect do you want Bitcoin to have on humanity?

Transition to a monetary system that is not based on ever-increasing exponential growth with its exploitation of human work force and natural resources of our small space ship earth, but instead a sustainable way of living together. I'd hope that a limited and in tendency deflationary monetary system free of outside manipulation can help in such a paradigm shift.

&gt; Ultimately, would you agree that the end goal is p2p electronic cash?

Depends how you define ""p2p electronic cash"". Anyway, this sort of thing will happen, with or without Bitcoin, we know it already now, this is unstoppable (except by totalitarian laws with strict and brutal enforcement). If not Bitcoin, then BCH or LTC or VTC can do that.

I think LN is an excellent way to realize the vision of p2p electronic cash, in complement to a blockchain. It is part of the overall scaling concept. Decentralization is paramount for a p2p electronic cash system, if you want to call it like that. So recoding each coffee purchase on a global ledger is not an option (unlike what many/most bcash shills say). Part of the p2p cash system will be alternative coins that come and go, e.g. some will become centralized and than lose in value and lose adoption, while others pop up. Alternative concepts like ""tangles"" will come up, then people will find its deficiencies liek centralization and reliability problems, and yet other methods will come up. We are only at the beginning of that process. The best decentralized p2p cash system is in the process of being found. In the meantime, Bitcoin must rely on its core competence, which is decentralization, reliability, and credible sustainable scaling strategy. If Bitcoin gose the short-term way like bcash, it it doomed to fail because it won't be able to compete with one of the other newer coins.",1525029093

"No, he said ""buy Bitcoin"" several times, then at the very end said ""buy Bitcoin cash"" after they had clicked to ""buy Bitcoin"" the seversl times.

That's like offering cheap flights from Indainapolis to London, England. Let the person select the date, ticket, and everything. Then at the *very last screen*, the final purchase button says ""purchase ticket to London, Ohio"". And instead of a flight across the Atlantic, they get a flight to a small town in Ohio named London.

Every single person in that scenario would get a full refund, and the airline and booking service would be shut down by law. You're simply not allowed to pull bait-and-switch tactics like that.


There's this funny thing about laws, they're made to make life a bit better. If companies were allowed to bait and switch like that - and most of them advertising something wouldn't even have the real thing to sell anyway - then customers would spend most of their shopping time just figuring out what is and isn't an outright total scam. And for the scam sellers, the more consumer time they can waste before the sale, the more likely it is that the person will overlook the switch. Thus, such things are illegal.",1525029016
"You are totally missing my point.  I am saying that Sunny Lu has been corrupted by a manipulator that could result in bringing down this entire house of cards.  This same person used to run the Walton Knights and was called Crypto FU.  The Waltonchain team didn’t agree to his ‘fee’ and he left under a cloud.  He jumped ship to VeChain and took with him a few of the Knights that he corrupted.  He then formed ChinaCrypto.Info and grew his army.  The feud between VeChain and Waltonchain started then and it was CREAM Crypto who started this entire shit show.  In part, due to his ego however he is motivated by greed and money and is not only corrupt but is skilled at gettings his tentacles into companies and CEOs and assuming power.  Just take a look in that TG group.  Nearly 2000 members and they all worship him.  This is only the tip of the iceberg.  He made his money instigating the famous Neo pump and dump.  I am glad he is gone from Waltonchain bit sadly he has made it his duty to damage Waltonchain.  People like this eventually get caught and go to prison.  I sincerely expect he is under investigation right now and unless the VeChain communtiymwork together to out him then there are dangeris waters ahead.  Why not some of you startnto look 8 to this and ask Sunny to clarify this relationship.  He needs to be fully transparent about the Coka Cola link as well because if it can be proven that CREAM Crypto is the CCK and has taen a fee from Sunny then BAM game over.

I hold no Bcash and you can look through my history and see that I only hold Nano at this particular moment, and have only held BTC/ETH/NANO/NEO for the better part of the last 6 months. I ditched NEO at $140 during the airdrop pump and there is proof of that in my post history.

It's a logic, process, system, cash, chain, concept etc. etc. If anything technically bch is more removed from the original protocol as they had to migrate to a different protocol, chain and algorithm during the fork. I disagree that btc should not use the name bitcoin as it is the clear evolution of the original and actual product and it is not a deviation of it. Btc didn't fork or change- it just remained the same when bch forked off of it. That's the difference. I have absolutely no Ill will for calling bch -bitcoin cash just as any of the other 27 alts can also use the same bitcoin as an appropriate prefix since they are all based off the initial ledger but they are not the actual and original product. I think the market has already spoken on what is the only original ""bitcoin."" I believe this topic is already over and I think it's a dream of people around here but all the exchanges and everybody publicly except for RogerV and this sub to say otherwise. To change this stance in the future publicly is unlikely to happen at best regardless of how the coins actually perform over time. It's quite possible that bch can become the facebook to btcs myspace but it's unlikely there will be any actual name change in the future. it doesn't make sense for anybody in an exchange, or owner of ATMs or other having to change signage or whatever to do this in the future. It also doesn't make sense just from a historical or a compatability perspective - for someone to have a old (like as in now if referencing the future) bitcoin that is incompatible with bch being called just bitcoin in the future introduces unneeded complexity for users in the future that I just don't think is smart or worth the confusion and hassle. Nobody wants to look back to today and say ""if I had bitcoin between these dates - is it bitcoin cash or bitcoin or what was it back then to know my money actually was."" It's not going to switch back and forth.   
  
Bitcoin cash or bcash are both fine names and quite honestly it seems silly to even have this war or who is the rightful heir to simply be named ""bitcoin."" This answer has already been provided to everyone whether anyone likes it or not.  
  
Another side point about bitcoin not being a company, it still has developers, miners etc and it is still a system of operation that law and governments will likely regulate and wrangle over time. Certainly, Roger V can be pressed to name his website appropriately (or clearly however you deem the distinction) and Reddit can be pressed to have appropriately names subs.

"&gt; I'm assuming that with the relative ease of forking a project and improving upon it, would certainly reduce the price of the previous iteration.

In real terms or relative terms?  Because if the whole crypto-space is growing, Bitcoin's price grows too.

&gt; but this in essence is printing more crypto

I'm saying that while this is technically true, it doesn't necessarily detract from the value of Bitcoin.  Think about the fact that other countries print their own dollars.  Does that dilute the value of the USD?  

&gt;  my main point is the price of crypto being affected by the limited quantity of fiat cash that the vast majority of people possess.

But that would hold true for *literally* any commodity right?  Like, when people come up with new shit, does that also dilute the value of bitcoin?  Shakeweights dilute the value of bitcoin?  I mean, I have to choose between a Shakeweight and Bitcoin, right?

Who we?  It isn't detracting from your USD value.

&gt; given that late adopters either by choice or even by the misfortune of being born too late will miss out on buying Bitcoin cheap to own a significant share

How is this different than Amazon stock, or any other company?

&gt; None of this would be a problem if Bitcoin and other crypto wasn't given a fiat value, because the crypto is valued without the use of traditional fiat valuation.

How can you even assume this is possible?  People want fiat dollars, so they trade bitcoin for them.  You can't ""not give it a fiat value"", because everyone is allowed to do their own thing.

"How is that getting 'scammed'?. If you buy BTC you are getting Bitcoin. If you buy BCH you are buying Bitcoin Cash.  If you buy $1000 worth of either you will get the appropriate amount.  $1000 today would buy you about 0.7 BCH.  If you bought BTC you would get approx 0.11 BTC.  

If you invest that $1000 in BCH (and have 0.7 BCH) but decide you were ""scammed"" (odd imo), in about 10 seconds you can exchange it for BTC on any exchange.  

If you don't want BCH, don't buy it.  If you buy BCH but decide you didn't want it, exchange it. ",1525027972
"&gt;  So if it happens that a lot of people will want to use Bitcoin, they literally can't.

I never assumed Bitcoin will stay at the current block size limit *forever*, and whenever this discussion was made, it turned out that most bitcoin'ers saw it the same way. Just now is not the right time to increase that limit, decentralization and efficiency improvements come first, and I agree with this approach of priorities. One has to be careful.

&gt; Not even with the LN which will still require a higher block size limit [...]

Yes, I fully agree, that is simple math and I always made this point when discussing it with ""1MB forever advocates"" (whom I consider just equally narrow minded and naive as the Roger Ver fan boys): With current Bitcoin blocksize, each capacity is just enough such that each inhabitant on planet earth can open/close one LN channel ONCE(!) in a lifetime(!) (=ca. 100 years), and with that the complete bitcoin capacity is already full. So it is evident that current Bitcoin capacity is not sufficient long-term for mainstream adoption of Lightning. This is really easy to remember and understand.

But today we are very far from that point, and decentralization is paramount. Once we go to mainstream adoption, technology has evolved and blocksize limit can be increased without risking decentralization. Each step at the right time. We also must ensure Bitcoin's long term viability, and this means long.term bitcoin must finance itself via TX fees exclusively, as block reward is zero one day.

"&gt; I'd be paying way more in taxes over the last few years.

Colloquially, this statement is to imply that they would be rich. Money and taxes so funny haha, more of it! Thats the joke!

But practically it doesn't make sense since they would likely have paid a tiny lump sum of taxes when they earned the bitcoin from the mining, at the price it was valued at when it was mined. This would have been a the lowest of income tax rates, with deductions on electricity bill and depreciating the hardware, and the government would have likely paid them since it cost more than the earnings were worth. **So way less in taxes so far.**

Then from the ownership of cryptocurrency they would have cashed out one of the years, and long term capital gains taxes which have a much lower tax rate than income taxes, and are also very easy to offset, almost completely. **So way less in tax RATE so far, with possibly one year having a large tax bill, but not multiple years like OP said.***

But lets assume OP sold in pieces across several years. Now the long term capital gains are always less and still easier to offset, mostly from losses in other assets if OP has any, but a useful strategy is to sell losing positions specifically for the loss deduction against winners. So with simple tax harvesting, OP would have still paid lower taxes in both $$ and %.

"Now, let me preface this by saying I *do not* have a deep understanding of the ethereum protocol -- I could very well be wrong about this specific type of change.

That said, I'm pretty confident that any changes of this nature to the Ethereum blockchain requires a hard fork. While there seems to be wide spread support for some of the major upcoming enhancements to Ethereum like Casper, any time a blockchain undergoes a hard fork there is a huge amount of risk, complexity, and pain. Think Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash. That is a really fundamental limitation of the purely distributed model that Bitcoin and Ethereum have, any sort of upgrade is an absolute nightmare, no matter the size.

That is, in my opinion, one of the key insights of VeChain from a mass adoption and longevity standpoint -- the crypto world is moving and light speed, and state of the art tech is changing rapidly. With VeChain's governance model, they *can* say 'hey, that is a good idea, lets run with it', unlike many other projects. Updates are much more possible, as things are more of a split between centralized and decentralized.

If I was a CTO level executive making a decision on a platform to run my enterprise on, I would always choose a technology that is more future-proofed and upgradable over one that is more stagnant. Ability to grow and adapt to the chaining blockchain landscape is going to help VeChain enormously with adoption.",1525026578

"Just because something had time and effort put into making it, doesn't mean it has value. 

Just because there's a limited quantity of something, doesn't mean it has value. 

Just because something is hard to counterfeit, doesn't mean it has value. 

I could work really hard on a shitty macaroni painting and it's virtually guaranteed to be worthless despite a lot of work going into it, it being rare, and extremely difficult for anyone to reproduce exactly. 

All those factors of rarity, ease of counterfeiting and cost to produce will affect the value if it has value. But none of them make it have value in the first place. 

Commodities that have intrinsic value through their use have already proven they aren't worthless. A bushel of corn can be eaten. A barrel of oil can be refined into various goods to be sold.

But a unit of a crypto currency or a normal fiat currency has no intrinsic value. You can't eat it. You can't do something to it to turn it into a good that can be sold. The only thing that makes it not worthless is that other people are willing to accept it in exchange for goods/services.

And the Dollar will always be accepted by the Federal Government for paying taxes even if it's not accepted anywhere else. There's no huge entity like that guaranteed to accept any crypto for the foreseeable future. Some individual companies might accept crypto but companies go in and out of existence on the regular.

"Well, you see, this is not about a company though, there is NO company behind bitcoin, owning either the brand or the ""product"". Bitcoin is a protocol, defined in a whitepaper, if you create a different protocol with different rules, normaly the name should be changed too, or some kind of versioning system should be used. Eg. HTTP is a protocol, like bitcoin, HTTPS while being basically identical to the original http protocol, but with a security layer on top of it, adopts a different naming, so that it doesn't break copatibility with older software using the plain http protocol. 
To be fair, neither bitcoin core, nor bitcoin cash, should be named just ""bitcoin"", they both made breaking changes with the past version of the protocol known as bitcoin.

Personally I believe that over time people will refer to bitcoin cash as just bitcoin, because it will end up being the most popular of the two, when i talk to people i just say i own ""bitcoin"" not ""bitcoin cash"". Anyway if that happens it will be a gradual change, Ver trying to force it into people is not that nice or responsible imho, but from a legal standpoint i think its still an interesting question, since it's such a unique case, we are talking about the naming of a protocol, which started as an open source project and whitepaper, with no known author or entity holding the trademark to the name..",1525025376

You brought up banks and financial institutions having control over our money. I just pointed out the same thing could happen with the world's miners getting together.

I think the likelihood of it happening is about the same as how far bitcoin does go and they would be in parallel.

Only 21 million bitcoin ever is semantics. If bitcoin reaches the level you want it too, people will exert power. Maybe it wont be called bitcoin anymore, like what happened wirh bitcoin cash, but either way, they could force regular users to use a mew bitcoin with over 21 million coins if they could get over 50% of the worlds miners.

"Sharding inherently involves trust in the rest of the network to verify the shards that you're not verifying, which removes the trustless nature of bitcoin, something that is quite fundamental to it. It's a bandaid fix to the inherent problem of on-chain scaling's inefficiencies, at the cost of seriously lowering the security model.

&gt; Even if those aren’t perfect solutions, it just shows that there are other solutions to the scaling problem than 2nd layer and bigger blocks.

To me this feels very handwavy, the scaling problem is *hard*. You can't just hope for a completely novel solution to pop up that will fix everything, that's wishful thinking.

&gt; My problem with what BTC is doing is they’re letting LN be the backbone of scaling. LN’s implementation won’t exactly be decentralized at scale. It’ll give rise to large companies with a lot of BTC opening channels as a sort of middle man, which isn’t too different than banks.

They're more like non-custodial payment processors, with skin in the game to prevent them from cheating you. No fractional reserve bullshit (protocol doesn't allow spending of bitcoin that hasn't been put in a channel on-chain), no custodial bullshit (LN's payment routing is non-custodial by nature), no censorship bullshit (you can just route around any blocking nodes).

There will always be some sort of centralization, the question is about how it threatens the working of the system. In bitcoin, mining centralization is a big problem because a 51% miner can push its competitors out of business in a deniable way, as well as outright rewriting history.

In LN, node centralization in terms of total funds, number of channels or size thereof, associated with the node has NO negative effects as far as I have been able to tell, and I have asked every single LN hater I've talked to.

Please, if you have some sort of insight that I don't, enlighten me; how does LN centralization cause any negative effect for a LN user that they cannot fix themselves?",1525023211

&gt; But if you are unable to keep those two ideas in your head at the same time without becoming confused then you are in way over your head and should get out before you throw your money away.

So let's do a thought experiment: tomorrow Microsoft branches from Bitcoin and sells coins from this branch off as ""Bitcoin"" under the mantle of ""buy Bitcoin"".

They got the SEC to declare that Bcash is the ""original chain"". Since that's completely wrong, coupled with the fact that SEC wouldn't have even cared about Bcash if not handed a ton of money, it's pretty obvious that someone from Bcash is bribing their way through the SEC.

"I think that once a flippening happens and BCH has higher price and market cap, then we could see a huge rapid price collapse in BTC as the world wakes up to reality.",1525022862

If a fork has absolutely no consensus it will drop down to near $0 like many other BTC forks.

I don't hold any BTC or BCH, but I wish people like you who have no idea what they're talking about would just shut up already. What's next, do you think Bitcoin is a trademarked name?

NEO is a centralized Chinese scam/shitcoin run through 7 privately owned servers. Maybe you should worry about that. Or maybe worry about the fact that those Chinese dumped on you and moved all their money to ONT, the next great pump &amp; dump.",1525022855
"It’s about as confusing as dollar (USD) and dollar (AUD).  Both are dollars, and when in a group of people who only use one, you can just refer to that one as the dollar, but exchanges will specify which one using the ticker.  

Fraud could mean selling BCH as BTC at BTC market price and having the profits go to Roger Ver.  It could also mean selling BTC for BCH price saying it’s BTC.  Neither of those things are happening.  If you go to buy Bitcoin on bitcoin.com, you get what it says you’re getting.  If you don’t know what it is you’re buying and you just click on the first lik, you probably shouldn’t buy it until you do a bit more research, and buying something when you don’t know what it is is your own fault.  Even if bitcoin.com was committing fraud, that would just mean it would be shut down.  The BCH network itself wouldn’t have done anything, just someone who supports it.  I don’t even know what to say about your theory that Ver and Wu bribed the SEC.",1525022833

Instead, they're using it to push forward a business that has already been quite successful. Their parent company, Squawk Advisors, already has a major investment portfolio (I think it's valued at like 2b?).

I think it's disingenuous, or maybe just ignorant, to say that one fork was contentious but the other wasn't. One was clandestine and one was overt, is more how I would put it. The BCH fork had to happen when it did because the SegWit change was about to be ""soft-forked"" into the blockchain with no alternative, it was a forced fork with no alternate fork. Miners could vote beforehand and they did, but after SegWit happened there *was* no alternate chain for miners to actually vote with their computing power. Except there was, it was called BCH.

Fork bitcoin and give free money to all its holders, thus feeding the greed of people and then continuing the shitshow with fake advertising, price manipulation, ridiculous pumps, insider trading, all possible bullshit that one could possibly associate a coin with  


Lets face it, the only reason Bcash has apologists is because it printed free money and for this reason alone, a minority crowd felt affection for the scammers behind the show. 

If bcash started off as a fairly mined coin with organic growth there would be nobody claiming ""big blocks are awesome"". bcash is merely a product of greed ",1525021335

And super large blocks inherently leads to centralization too, and the fact that the idea that gigabit blocks are acceptable is crazy IMO. 144GB per day? No thank you.

I know BTC has true scripting ability, so it can’t handle Ethereum’s plasma chain framework, but can’t BCH? They can BOTH implement some sort of sharding.

"&gt; What if the majority of users and miners had wanted to change this rule?

If it's an overwhelming majority then the old chain would die, and we'd have a non-contentious hard fork. This happened once, when a bug was discovered after Mike Hearne made an incompatible change to the Bitcoin Core source code, switching from the Berkeley database to LevelDB. Everyone agreed to hard fork to fix the bug, and the old chain died off.

If it wasn't an overwhelming majority, you'd end up with a new altcoin chain (like what happened with the Bcash fork). The new chain isn't Bitcoin, it's a new altcoin since its blocks aren't valid under the Bitcoin rules.

&gt; Please can you explain what you mean (re. insufficient difficulty in bcash blocks)

Yes. When bcash forked, they realized that there wasn't much support for it, and that they wouldn't be able to get enough miners mining it, so they changed the difficulty rules. They implemented something they called ""emergency difficulty adjustment"", which said something like ""if less than 6 blocks were mined in the last 12 hours then reduce the difficulty by 20%"". The rule triggered many times, dropping the difficulty significantly. Once that had happened, miners started mining it again resulting in hundreds of blocks being mined per hour for a while at low difficulty. Those blocks had very little proof of work behind them - enough to satisfy the bcash rules, but not enough to satisfy the Bitcoin rule about how much proof of work is required.",1525021110

However, it doesn't take long to realize the huge price difference between BTC and BCH just like ETH and ETH classic. 

The point here is that it's absurd and hypocritical to take an open source project that already has many forks and try to claim some kind of trademark ownership. The Bitcoin brand is so overused and synonymous with cryptocurrencies in general it's almost like Kleenex or similar brands. I have seen people say they invested in bitcoins when they actually bout ETH and LTC. 

Honestly, most investors (and most especially newbies) don't care as much about the longest chain or Satoshi's vision, but rather which currency is going to bring the most return. Anyone throwing in money so carelessly that they don't realize the difference between BTC and BCH probably is the same investor who will be buying up those shitcoins that don't have a white paper or even a web site. 

This whole thing is really more about a personal dispute between the core developers and Ver and a few others. I personally think it's extremely childish to play these games like calling BCH BCash or PayPal v2.0 or claiming that everything they do is an attack on Bitcoin, or using heavy comment moderation to shape the message. This, to me, is just as, or even more, immature, manipulative, and deceptive as some of Ver's actions.

It is hypothetically possible that some day in the future, Bitcoin will have to change drastically from the Satoshi's original whitepaper to succeed. That's why I don't agree with measuring the legitimacy of the Bitcoin name with how the technical specifications of the chain represent the original. It is convenient for BCH now to use this argument, but it is not fundamentally correct. Satoshi himself establishes that the chain with the most support is the most legitimate chain.

"Non-mining nodes do not add blocks to the block chain and thus cannot vote in the system's consensus mechanism. As such, these nodes provide utility almost entirely for the user running them, *NOT* for the network as a whole. In fact, poorly resourced or badly configured non-mining nodes represent a net drain on the network as a whole. So at best, a non-mining node contributes almost nothing to the network, and what it does contribute is quite marginal, but most non-mining nodes are operated quite far from a best-case situation (in fact, a likely strong majority of them run without opening a listening port) so *on average* non-mining nodes are a net negative on the network as a whole.  

That said, we have years of evidence now from the BTC block chain that even with quite large numbers of non-mining nodes operating on the network, the system still works just fine (i.e. the cumulative net drain of large numbers of less-than-optimal non-mining nodes doesn't significantly handicap the overall network).",1525018761

We need to make sure we scale fast enough to allow these new people come onto Bitcoin, even if it means risking some decentralization or risking it becoming, like I said, Paypal 2.0”

"By /u/foolish_austrian from [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2o71hh/physics_and_economics_will_distributed_mining_im/) 


As someone who comes from a physics and engineering background, over the long run I'm not concerned with mining centralization. Physics will ensure it is distributed.

To qualify, I think there will be strong ebbs and flows while we catch up to Moore's law. During the next few years, hardware is simply going to depreciate too quickly.

Around the year 2024, we are expected to hit the quantum mechanical limit, which broadly speaking means we will have perfected the silicon transistor to the atomic level. If we make them any smaller, they become transparent to matter. (Incidentally, I work on replacements for transistors that use the angular momentum of electrons to store data).

As we approach this limit, mining hardware is going to depreciate over years, not months. When this happens, the dynamics of mining investment will substantially change. Mining in Greenland with cheap energy and cool climate will actually be more expensive than decentralization. Actually, the profit from mining will go negative, Greenland mining will become impossible in it's current form.

What mining does is convert electricity to heat, but not just any heat... specifically something between 90C to 120C, or heat around the boiling point of water. This heat density is too low for most industrial uses, except possibly things like water purification. It cannot be used for smelting, semiconductor processes, or anything that requires very high heat density without a heat pump.

As a result, what do you do with the enormous capacity to produce ~100C heat? For discussion sake, I'm going to address residential and industrial water heaters, although you could imagine other similar distributed use cases for small amounts of heat.

I just ran over to Sears website and checked the EnergyStar rating on water heaters, and found the average to be about $300/year. According to the US census there are approximately 115 million households in the United States. This means there is about a 34.5 Billion dollar market for electricity to heat conversion. Since 100C (semiconductor temperatures) is just about right to heat water to 55C, this is an absolutely natural market for bitcoin mining.

One could vaguely argue that with limited industrial uses and expanding worldwide, we could take the 34.5 Billion dollar market and multiply by about 5x to estimate the worldwide market. That puts the total market for heat conversion at just under 200 Billion.

Now for the economic argument. In a stable and predictable market (i.e. post superexponential growth), the profit from mining is going to be capped by the marginal cost of mining... ALWAYS. This means that anybody who can 'recycle' heat can afford a negative marginal cost, and therefore mine at a loss. The profit from mining will be negative. Simply speaking, approximately 200 Billion dollars worth of heat can be produced in the mining of bitcoin, and 'sold' to the homeowner to heat water.

There are many possible incarnations of this, but we could imagine a water heater with a heater 'rebate'. Electric power companies could act like mining pools. Since the marginal cost of mining for anyone not recycling heat is negative, the total profit from mining goes negative... It would require more than 200 Billion dollars worth of electricity to be produced for free. (actually more than 200 Billion because data centers require cooling).

As a result, the mining centralization we see in Greenland and large data centers becomes enormously unprofitable. Any centralization of mining would REQUIRE heat recycling, which severely limits data centers and necessitates distribution unless you introduce heat pumps, which also increase cost.

So this leads to a new threat for centralization... mining pools operated by Electric Power companies. However, electricity production and distribution is inherently a geographically localized industry (you cannot cheaply transmit electricity across long distances). Therefore the number of power companies are likely to remain much much greater than the number of mining pools today. In addition, since nation-states distrust each other, Most want their own power generation. This makes at least 196 natural divisions.

Thankfully small amounts of heat is something that is needed in every season, in every country, in every household worldwide. Data center heat is useless; in fact it's a waste product that has to be removed from the building...

Also, 200 Billion is a huge market for security :-)

Just my musings....

Edit: minor changes for clarity Edit: There was a math error... the expenditure on hot water is approximately 200 Billion, not 2 Trillion.",1525018271

"**Loaded question**

A loaded question or complex question fallacy is a question that contains a controversial or unjustified assumption (e.g., a presumption of guilt).

Aside from being an informal fallacy depending on usage, such questions may be used as a rhetorical tool: the question attempts to limit direct replies to be those that serve the questioner's agenda. The traditional example is the question ""Have you stopped beating your wife?"" Whether the respondent answers yes or no, he will admit to having a wife and having beaten her at some time in the past. Thus, these facts are presupposed by the question, and in this case an entrapment, because it narrows the respondent to a single answer, and the fallacy of many questions has been committed.

"You're right, Sw2x was just one of many attacks from the ""big block"" camp. I'll summarize how for any newcomers who read this.

Small blocks are a security parameter set by Satoshi Nakamoto. Small blocks protect Bitcoin in a few ways, all of them related to decentralization. Decentralization is why Bittorrent is alive and well, while centralized Napster was dismantled long ago. Decentralization is crucial to prevent minority interests (such as a government or mining cartel) from hijacking the public utility protocol and changing it to suit their own interests. This decentralization is fostered by small blocks firstly by making resources on the blockchain scarce. Resource scarcity means spammers cannot stuff blocks full of economically meaningless transactions for *free*. The anti-bloat objective is to *minimize the discouragement* that ordinary people using ordinary computers may face when running fully validating nodes, since those need to store the entire block chain. It's not only storage, it's also bandwidth which is an economic burden which some people cannot afford, and latency. Latency is the time a node needs to validate the contents of a block before it propagates it to the rest of the network. Bigger blocks increase the amount of data being validated every 10 minutes which increases latency, which favors larger mining pools who find blocks (and collect block rewards and tx fees) more often than small pools. Because the mining pool which found a block can start searching for the next block while nodes are still validating and propagating a block recently found, and because large blocks increase latency, larger pools gain an additional advantage over smaller rivals, again reducing decentralization and encouraging centralization. Thus both nodes and miners are faced with a centralizing pressure when blocks size is increased.

One of the ways decentralization protects network participants is by increasing the requirements for consensus. Consensus means broad agreement about implementing proposed changes. A centralized authority can make changes which are self-serving, while a system which requires consensus from a decentralized group is more aligned with the interests of the many. 

Decentralization is therefore defense. It's always better to overshoot security than undershoot it. The reason security matters so much is that as a disruptive technology, which challenges the most powerful institutions man has ever built, it has powerful and indefatigable enemies. Enemies which will do everything they can to delay or destroy the threat to themselves.  

The big block camp would trade security for lower fees, hoping it encourages adoption, which would help them ""get rich quick""-er. That's understandable. However simply increasing the block size as they'd like requires a hard fork to the consensus rules, BCH is such an example. As predicted such a controversial hard fork created a chain split because it lacked consensus. A chain split will always splinter and divide the community and it's not hard to see that the enemies of bitcoin have been highly motivated to encourage such a hard fork to Bitcoin for a long time. The enemies of Bitcoin have been fanning this block size controversy all along, HKA, BU, XT, NYA &amp; SW2X are all battles they lost.          

Not everyone who wanted such a hard fork is an enemy of bitcoin, but every enemy of bitcoin wanted such a hard fork and an unknown proportion of people who support BCH are such enemies, not all but some. Maintaining consensus, evolving the software with the will of the entire decentralized network can be difficult and frustrating but it's a feature not a bug. ",1525016460

What is downvoteworthy about that?     
             
Or has the naming convention changed overnight and you literally do not understand the words I am saying?",1525016306
"Although there's some truth to the explanations here so far, I think there's also some basic misunderstanding. First of all, a seed is *NOT* a mnemonic representation of a private key.  

More importantly, both private keys and seeds at their most basic are the same thing: numbers. It's important not to confuse what they actually *are* with their *representation*. Both elements, seeds and private keys, are individual numbers picked from almost unimaginably large number spaces, so representing them in the ways we normally use to convey numbers (for example, everyday decimal, aka base-ten; or if you've done a little computer science, hexadecimal or base16) gets unwieldy. This is why, even using [base58](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base58), the Bitcoin address format is a fairly long series of characters.  

So what's the difference between private keys and seeds? There's a specific maximum size difference, and a difference in purpose. A private key is a 256-bit number that represents the ""private key"" in a [public-key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) key pair. Along with it's corresponding public key, the pair is generally thought of as controlling and/or referring to a single Bitcoin address and any funds therein (in the present context; and this is not strictly correct: there are really more private/public key pairs than there are addresses, but its good enough for this discussion). In particular, the private key is the critical value that permits *sending* funds from the corresponding address.  

The seed is a 128-bit number that is used as a selection of *entropy* (a measure of randomness). This entropy can then be used in a specific mathematical scheme to generate a subset of all the numbers in a 256-bit numerical space. In the Bitcoin use-case, all the numbers in a resulting subset are the private keys generated by that seed. So a seed permits you to create a vast number of seemingly independent, apparently random private keys, but all of which can really be recreated as long as you know the value of the seed and the scheme used to generate the subset of private keys.  

Now the thing you usually see when people talk about a specific private key or a specific seed, is just the number for each item represented in a scheme that has been adopted by convention. For a 256-bit private key, the most common scheme is the [wallet import format (WIF)](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Private_key#Base58_Wallet_Import_format). With a 128-bit seed, there's really more than one representation standard used, but they each typically use a wordlist and make mnemonic, or string of common words. The end result of one such scheme is that it's essentially a way to represent a number that would be the equivalent of ""base 2048"" (you can learn more about ""base"" or ""radix"" [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix)).  

In terms of how each are generated, it depends on whether you are using a seed to create a subset of private keys (aka a hierarchical deterministic using a seed), or if you are just creating a single private key. You'd basically want to create a number that's as random as possible in either case, but randomness is strictly *better* generated in the physical world than on an electronic device. That's why they say you can do it offline. So in the case of a 256-bit private key, you could flip a coin 256 times and record the outcomes as 0 or 1 (the equivalent would be rolling a 32-sided dice eight times, or a six-sided dice 99 times). To create a seed, you'd flip the coin 128 times.  

Here's a [specific demonstration](http://ryndon.com/2017/03/14/how-to-create-a-bitcoin-address-using-dice/) so you get the idea. In this article, where the author says you can open bitaddress.org and then disconnect from the Internet, you actually can go much further in the quest for absolute security. The best practice would be to download the bitaddress website from GitHub, check the code yourself so you know that it hasn't been tampered with and does what it claims to, and then run that code on a computer (that's also running all other code that's been similarly vetted -- in practice people usually just use a trusted Live CD like [Tails](https://tails.boum.org/)) that's disconnected from the Internet. But each individual needs to decide for themselves exactly how ""cold"" is good enough practice for them.",1525016274
"1. Yes, LBCH has an escrow service. Even _with_ the escrow though, I still will not accept Paypal; this comes from my experience as a Mycelium seller. Paypal has a _very_ long period where retraction is allowed and you don't want to be on the receiving end of that. 

2. Bank transfer etc. are safer, so do use escrow with those. Still, don't sign off on the escrow until you see fiat in your account: remember, never give out irreversible money in Bitcoin(Cash)  until you make sure the other end is reasonably irreversible as well. 

3. The best way to do things, if you're in a reasonably safe neighborhood, is to actually take paper cash in person - hand me the bills, I'll QR you the BCH, no ambiguity. At least for first time clients. Do a little bit of due diligence on how to tell blatant forms of counterfeiting; unless your client is Kim Jong Un, counterfeiters don't usually bother with watermarks, 3D sculpting (in the case of USD, it's the presidents' collars. put your fingers on it and get a feel!) or microprinting.

4. Even in person, don't allow Paypal, _especially_ for first timers. They can reverse the payment after they're safely home and you can no longer punch them in the face. The risk for them is basically nil.

5. 1.05 is pretty fair, it's of course up to you - people in more risky places like Zimbabwe have been known to charge as much as 100% premium on LBC. It all depends on your personal appetite for fluctuations, and whether you take the coffee cost into account. =)

6. Last but not least, do use common sense and a basic level of street smarts. Happy trading!

Here's a TL;DR

""For many years, there has been a recurring argument against on-chain scaling based on the idea that the blockchain is a “database that must store everything, forever”.....

In this article, I will argue that the “storing everything forever” argument is flawed, and is a case of the Public Goods fallacy. This fallacy is used as justification for central planning which should be rejected in favor of a market-based approach. With such an approach, we don’t need to worry about block space being crowded out, or that non-monetary uses will detract from Bitcoin Cash as money.""",1525016068

"Bitcoin transactions are a little weird.  The Input is an Unspent TX Output(UTXO) you'd received to that wallet in the past.  You can't spend just part of a UTXO,  you must use the entire thing when you do.  If that UTXO is more coin than you want to send, your wallet creates a new UTXO to an address you already control in that wallet for the difference.  If its less UTXO than you want to send, your wallet will try to find an additional full UTXO to use.

In this case, it looks like you sent 53.43 mBTC to 19qi but had to use a UTXO of at lease 67.94 mBTC so the difference of 1.45 went to 3QT9.  Approximately 0.067 mBTC went to the miner's fee, the bribe you float as incentive for a miner to include your transaction.

"Yeah, what would it mean for Bcash to win this way? This subreddit is filled with people who claim they've been around forever and people like that know that satoshi's vision is big blocks etc. That's obviously, at this point, not the case and what Ver is trying to do is bring in a new crop of totally confused people and raise the relative value of bcash that way. Imagine if that somehow worked. Imagine if Ver convinced Bezos, Buffet and Gates to pump bcash to the moon and it was worth more than bitcoin. It still wouldn't be the bitcoin that early adopters chose to buy. BCH's claim to being bitcoin is effectively dead in my opinion. Early adopters, the owners of the coin, have spoken unambigiously in the market and the miners and Ver while big market participants are in the clear minority. Bcash should try to succeed as an alt with a simpler scaling solution.

And I should add regarding my billionaires buying Bcash scenario above, this was just an unlikely hypothetical. Its extremely unlikely for Ver's underhanded tactics to do anything but backfire. If people are buying Bcash based on deception they aren't going to be committed. When they read the whitepaper themselves and talk to experts they are just as likely to switch over to bitcoin anyway. Its not impossible to convince someone that the no full node 0 conf method is closer to Satoshi's vision than Bitcoin with segwit is, although I disagree, but just tricking newbies in is not the same as making that case rigorously and actually convincing people. Marketing and deception is only going to give bcash a short term boost and in the long run the deceptive aspects will ruin the brand. I would be the first to acknowledge that if fees rose to something like $100 it could be a major problem for Bitcoin. However, if that happens at this point BCH is so tainted in my mind I'd buy Ethereum or Litecoin as a hedge and if you manage to convince people that Bcash is bitcoin what are they going to do at that point. Think Bcash has $100 fees too? What do you hope to accomplish?",1525015641

"Most of the buyers of Btc bought because they saw it on a news sound bite. They weren't cypherpunks or libertarians trying to use sound money. Most of the market are profit seekers unaware of the implications of their currency. A lot of this can be attributed to limited information. Most of the news people hear about Bch is a misrepresentation. The story that came after the event the OP linked was your typical mudslinging of politics. If you know about the dragons den group it may she'd some light on what I'm referring to. In short, btc has a bigger propaganda (marketing) machine behind the first mover. 

I'd say most Bch fans here were the early btc buyers of 2013 or before. Some came later as early adopters but the ideology was set by the few. They get heavily outnumbered by the general populace who just want another venMO and eventually get their message drowned out. Then the culture changes to price perception. So rather than ask the question, ""Why is this worth more now?"" we often find a more productive question of, ""What has the most utility?"".

"First of all, consider ""addresses"" in Bitcoin are not analogous to bank accounts where you have some total amount an can transfer part of it. Instead, what we have are ""coins"", often referred to as ""unspent transaction output (UTXO)"". Each coin has some value, for example, 0.2437 BCH, and can be redeemed by specific private key (or sometimes - by a more complex script called a smart contract). You can't redeem a part of that coin. So if you have to pay 0.1 BCH, you have to split that coin into two, one of 0.1 value, which will go to the receiving address of the receiver and the second one of value 0.1437, which will go to a change address of yours.

A legacy address looks like this: 39M95ZPG2M5DJ9CizQmqSsnt2N3EJyzpSR - this is the original format of the address as invented by Satoshi Nakamoto. Cash Addr is a new format originally invented by Pieter Wuille for Bitcoin (Core), slightly refined in Bitcoin (Cash), it looks like this: bitcoincash:ppfla28mmaezfhyfs9adupafnzlyy5xteqrr2vamtt. Both are just a human-readable representation of the same public key but the latter has a better checksum algorithm.

Master key is just a binary version of what the seed represents. Master public key can be derived from it.

"Don't take it personally, but I have to reply.

""Besides, since when do banks actually give a shit about what you do with your money.""

First fiat was never your money it's owned by the 'creator', even that can be argued about, in fact it is a debt issued by the bank.
This fact alone takes some time to sink in, and dive into the rabbit hole:
First,a debt to who?
And once accepted it is a debt why are we all so stupid to accept this shit as a settlement for our labor, even worse why the hell are we all trying to collect as much as debt as fast as possible and feel good about holding it?

We are literally accepting a debt note, and that debt is to an unknown person or something, for our labor.
And we have been brainwashed to such an extent that we feel and act as if these debt notes are valuable.
Brainwashed so much that we go to a bank, let them create these debt notes out of nothing and are willing to pay these banks for some 20 years, or more, with our labor to not only pay the original sum lended but also pay that sum two or more times as a compensation for this 'service' (loan for a house)...
All this time the house is owned by the bank, they force you to insure it against all possible risk and guess who is offering you this insurance?
AND NEVERTHELESS THIS SYSTEM OF FREE MONEY WITHOUT RISK THEY ARE CAPABLE OF SO MUCH MISS MANAGEMENT THAT BANKS CAN GO BANKRUPT....

The banks are in such a bad shape that we now have written laws that state that the depositors are nothing less than a unsecured liability to the banks ( I must check the words I use, English is not my native language). In simple words; if you put your money in the banks you are more or less the last in line to get your money back if the bank would go bankrupt.
And for that risk you take you are rewarded with no compensation what so ever (0,1% or something?)

So back to ""Besides, since when do banks actually give a shit about what you do with your money.""
Yes they do care what you do with their money and your labor.
They want it all, they want you to use their debt paper and that you pay to use or get it with your labor.
They want you to be in debt so you are their slave, best without you knowing or feeling that way.

Is it getting clear what's at stake for them, for you to NOT get involved with BTC, BTC in many ways the opposite of fiat?

That's why those who went into the rabbit hole are so passionate about BTC.
That's why some of us are so strong about HODLING.
That's why we have so much education to do.

Some people legitimately believe BCH is the ""real"" bitcoin. I don't think that's dishonest. 

Also, holding BCH isn't ""supporting"" bitcoin.com. If it's supporting anything, it's supporting a decentralized blockchain that isn't controlled by anyone. It's not like bitcoin.com is the only way to get BCH.

"**One-time pad**

In cryptography, the one-time pad (OTP) is an encryption technique that cannot be cracked, but requires the use of a one-time pre-shared key the same size as, or longer than, the message being sent. In this technique, a plaintext is paired with a random secret key (also referred to as a one-time pad). Then, each bit or character of the plaintext is encrypted by combining it with the corresponding bit or character from the pad using modular addition. If the key is truly random, is at least as long as the plaintext, is never reused in whole or in part, and is kept completely secret, then the resulting ciphertext will be impossible to decrypt or break.

In cryptography, the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) offers a variant of the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) which uses elliptic curve cryptography.

**Fiat–Shamir heuristic**

The Fiat–Shamir heuristic is a technique in cryptography for taking an interactive proof of knowledge and creating a digital signature based on it. This way, some fact (for example, knowledge of a certain number secret to the public) can be proven without revealing underlying information. The technique is due to Fiat and Shamir (1986). The original interactive proof must have the property of being public-coin, for the method to work.

How come I can upload 100's of gigabytes of videos to youtube who then hosts it for me, free of charge. 

How much storage can bitfury and bitmain and all the other mining companies buy with their millions of dollars in profit. 

Do you think they would make or less money with Bitcoin Cash being so popular that we are filling up a GB of blockspace every 10 minutes, every tx paying at least a dollar cent worth of Bitcoin Cash on top of the generation reward.

Satoshi already gave the answer in the whitepaper. As long as the growth of bandwidth and memory and storage of the bitcoin network grows at the same speed or slower then the improvements in all those areas that the world still sees ... there will not be a problem. 

We are good for the next 20 years or longer and by then we will probablly know if Bitcoin can work as a global payment system or not. If we don't know it by then, then we can try for another 20 years. If we do Bitcoin will become so important that if scaling issues would arrive that would jeopardize billion dollar companies and their business models ... you would have 20 000 of  the smartest people working on possible solutions.

We have his boosters land live on youtube while milllions of people where watching it live  which probably generated more bandwidth then the entire bitcoin network does in a month.

And somehow somebody is trying to tell me that if Bitcoin-BTC would increase the blocksize from 1 MB per 10 minutes, which is less data then a goddamn floppy disk can hold. to 2 MB per 10 minutes ... that might be the beginning of the end of Bitcoin.

If you know your seed and if you know your ""derivation path"", you can be sure that you can access your crypto funds in the future, even when the wallet sotware you originally used no longer exists. and / or your phone / PC is destroyed. The seeds and derivation path are all you need. It's possible for a wallet to not use seeds at all and simply generate totally random private keys (this is how it originally worked several years ago). But then you have to be extra careful to archive those keys somewhere because if you lose them (e.g. your phone breaks down), you have no way to access them again. The seeds were invented precisely in order to make your life easier so that you don't have to manually backup files with your private keys.

Second question: At the lowest level, private keys are just a (pseudo)random sequence of zeroes and ones, 256 of them. You usually don't work directly with this sequence, it's translated to some other pseudo-format before it's used / displayed. Those ""pseudo formats"" are not always compatible but knowledgeable Bitcoin user can almost always translate them from one format to another. To answer your final question: If you have a private key (in any format), in 99.99999% of the cases it's all you need to access funds for that address from any other wallet software.

A government cannot (more specifically do not anymore) decree their currency be worth a specific thing. Things like hyperinflation would be impossible if they could.

On top of that you're putting fiat money and legal tender into an equivalency, which is wrong. Legal Tender does not have to be fiat money and fiat money doesn't have to be legal tender. I could print my own fiat money and people might even use it as currency but it'd not be legal tender.

&gt;Fiat money does not have any intrinsic value. What value it has depends on public confidence in the currency's issuer. Legal tender is any currency declared legal by a government.

"How does a high public valuation make a coin shit?

Untested, sure, but they're typically building on what was learned when previous coins were running a mainnet. 

That's how these things work. Most significant new technologies require three goes before we get it right. 

First attempts usually just demonstrate a working technology. They kick off the industry, but ultimately don't define it because they're not sophisticated enough. Bitcoin pretty much fits this description.

Innovators see these first attempts, and reinvent to flesh out the functionality. They have to start from scratch. Vitalik was originally tried to do Ethereum on Bitcoin, but found it was too hard to make the necessary changes. You may notice there still isn't a working smart contract system based on BTC.

Of course all that new functionality was ungrounded to start, but once it got used in anger, the holes appeared. Doesn't scale anywhere near enough (witness Crypto Kitties). Having a cost to EVERY transaction limits dApps to a very narrow range of utility. 

Third Generation repeats the process, retaining the functionality, but fixes how it applies on a global scale. They provide unlimited scaling potential. They provide alternative cost structures more suitable to real dApps on a global scale.

That's the value proposition that people are buying into, on several fronts. We'll see which ones win.

____


Assume your dad wants to buy Bitocin. He googles ""buy Bitcoin"", gets directed to Bitcoin dot com as first result and then sees the header saying ""Buy Bitcoin"". Your father has no fucking idea what ""Buy Bitcoin Core"" is supposed to even mean. Of course he clicks ""buy Bitcoin"", because that's what the wanted. 


He also never really cared Bitcoin Cash, or forks, political drama, nothing, all he wanted is to buy Bitcoin. 


And now he owns Bitcoin Cash, because he got mislead. 



Your dad now holdsa Cryptocurrency, thinking it's Bitcoin, but it's not. Not only that, your father has also no fucking idea what Bitcoin Cash is. Not only that, but your father also doesn't know that many in the community believe BCH to be a scam. He doesn't know that. 


Your dad now holds Bitcoin Cash. 



_____ 



What are you going to tell him? 


*Hey, you though you bought Bitcoin, but did you know that ... you didn't? You bought like a fork and it's a little complicated, lots of drama involved, but essentially you support a different community. Also some people think your ""Bitcoin"" is a scam.*




You can be philosophical. about genesis blocks and white papers all you want. It doesn't change the fact that your dad simply got tricked into buying the wrong thing. That's it. That's all you need to know. 



I have absolutely *no fucking with BCH whatsoever*.  





_____ 



Essentially, I could create a webpage, design it so well that the people that go there, buy my coin, and not Bitcoin and since my coin is a fork, I have all the right to just label the buy header ""Buy Bitcoin"".  




Is that how it's supposed to be? 




https://ethereumclassic.github.io/



This is a healthy fork example. You see what they're doing? They're not advertising ETC to be ETH, do they? 



Why are they not doing that? Because they don't see the need to bootstrap their coin, from nothing, and abuse a brand. 


They don't advertise ""Buy Ethereum"", but you get ETC instead, do they?

Another thing some here don't seem to understand is that nobody is going to sue Bitcoin Cash by itself, as that's not possible. 



What is possible however is sueing a pageowner, with a registered name and adress. They sue on the merrit of him selling stones and saying it's gold. That's it. It's theft and trickery and Roger has had his past with doing questionable stuff like this. He lacks the moral compass to really show him what he can and simply cannot do. 


Yes, in his head BCH is Bitcoin. Too bad your father is not Crypto enough to really understand what is going on in the first place. He wanted Bitcoin, plain and simple and he got tricked, plain and simple.

Also nobody ever said forks are bad. I don't have a problem with the thousand of forks from Bitcoin. No fucking problem. 



It becomes a problem when these things start to happen and when bad actors are doing all they can marketing wise, because marketing is all they can do , that it starts to become a problem. 

Cheaper and faster transactions than Bitcoin. And that's true! Transactions are very fast and cheap in Bcash, so why do you need to trick people into your coin, if it was so much better than the Segwit alternative? 



See, there's never been a fight between Bitcoin and Litecoin, you know why? Because they're not tricking anyone. 




And since many rcryptocurrency people are too lazy or put off by the entire ordeal, they automatically start assuming that it's Bitcoin that's responsible for this terror, when the truth is, there has never been a single BCH in Reddit history, that only had comments about how BCH does something good.

Fori example, if you invest in Altcoin A, and that goes up 50%, whereas BTC goes up 100% and Altcoin B goes up 200% (all in relation to USD, of course) then you lost potential earnings by not picking Altcoin B.  The fact that you're using BTC as an intermediate doesn't matter at all, because you'll only be holding it for a few seconds in between transfers, so its own price volatility won't affect your earnings. All that matters is every coin's value in relation to something with a stable price, like USD, so you can properly benchmark your profits.",1525006152

Also turns out that theymos once did some calculations and those where stolen of his server by Gavin Andressen. He just found a copy of them, and the craziest thing happened, you will not believe this. Turns out that a blocksize in crease to 2 MB is a brilliant solution completely overlooked by the core team that theymos came up with but completely forgot about after Gavin  stole it.  The ultimate way of scaling bitcoin was totally stolen by Bitcoin Cash who stole it and while stealing it tried to take credit for it. Did I mention they stole it?

"- i don't keep up with all of this stuff.  but if you're going to make a vid like this and you don't want to just preach to the choir it would be nice to source some of it.  ie. bitcoin core mocks the idea of peer to peer cash - who in it?  what's their role?  what did they say?

- at the end of the day HODL builds a speculative bubble, not a currency.  transactions between people and with merchants builds a currency.  the best arguments would be continually tracking and updating some simple metrics for me:
  1. what's the on-chain cost to move $20
  2. what's the on-chain cost compared to LN to move $20
  3. and how complex actually was that, and how long did it take?
  4. how much money/people is actually in/being used by LN?
  5. what's the merchant adoption rate like for each currency - who/how many people are actually accepting it as payment?
  6. for those that might divulge it, what % of their revenue comes in as crypto?

at the end of the day i think all these arguments are pointless distractions.  whatever gets adopted *for real use* will win, whether it's BTC or BCH or something else.  i think it is wasted effort to keep having this B* civil war and the fighting over names or anything that might appear deceptive to newbs doesn't help anyone.  i like the idea of branding bitcoin cash as green because it's a clear difference, and creating a much more succinct history and objective evaluation between the two to let new users see their merits and help make a choice.

to me, only the above things really matter.  i don't care what the price or market cap is and neither should anyone else, that doesn't mean it's a good currency nor a bad one, nor a useful one fulfilling its actual purpose as currency.

did some darknet site switch from BTC to XMR?  that's a real story.  did remittances from one country go from being done in BTC to BCH?  that's a real story.  did some merchant stop accepting BTC?  did others start accepting BCH?  that is the kind of stuff that is actually interesting.  not arguing about what the 'real bitcoin' is nor these silly little things like attackers saying 'bcash' like stupid people liked to point out obama's middle name was 'hussein' - all that shit is childish crap.

In psychology this is called ""unit bias"". The human brain is accustomed to dealing with whole numbers or full portions, not fractional units or decimals. The concept of a cryptocurrency is already confusing enough to most people. We're only making it harder by assuming them to intuitively know that one Bitcoin isn't the smallest unit. Furthermore, Bitcoin is not a fiat currency, so expecting someone to think of Bitcoin's divisibility as if it were one is misguided.

The design problem is website UIs. They suck for newbies. There never any reference to Bitcoin units. Just ""Bitcoin"". No option to price in bits, satoshis, etc. Pricing is only done in Bitcoin, even when it's something like 0.005 BTC. 

But to be fair, the general public only understands Bitcoin units in terms of 100 million satoshis, probably so do Bitcoin users.

* State-issued money which is neither convertible by law to any other thing, nor fixed in value in terms of any objective standard.

"I personally use two virtual machines (virtualbox), with the signer disconnected from the network, and generally no programs running on the host, except for virtual machines. The security of that setup rests on the (practical) impossibility to escape from a virtual machine to the host.

An alternative method would be to use two phones, with one signer phone disconnected from the network, and both phones communicating unsigned/signed transactions over QRCodes. In principle, the electrum wallet supports that procedure.

Security means that there is something impossible to do, and that the entire design respects that impossibility.

For example, it is intractable to reverse an elliptic curve multiplication: P = k x G with k the private key and P the public key. The entire hardware/software/math design in bitcoin seeks to respect this intractability. That is the foundation of its security.

What exactly would be the foundation of the security of existing hardware wallets?

I do not see how they prevent copying the secrets to the internet, besides some really flimsy software abstractions. I can talk to the hardware wallet from the laptop and even update the firmware. Who says that the attacker who controls the laptop will not be able to do that too? On grounds of what principle would that be impossible?",1525003280
"You are unfortunately missing important context.

To understand where we are coming from you have to take into account several nuances of ""Bitcoin"" here. Bitcoin qua the design, Bitcoin as it existed before the split and ""Bitcoin"" as a particular chain is considered by ingroup preferences. 

The introduction post on BitcoinTalk.org (archived so you don't have to visit it, since it is operated by a big Bitcoin Cash opponent) clearly states that

&gt;Bitcoin Cash is a split from Bitcoin [the majority chain previous to the fork] with a protocol upgrade to fix on-chain capacity. If Bitcoin Cash gets majority of PoW then it becomes de facto Bitcoin.

&gt;It will be a[!] Bitcoin without segwit as soft fork, where upgrades of the protocol are done mainly through hard forks, without changing the economic rules of the Bitcoin.

&gt;Websites where it is possible to see fees on the Bitcoin network

This is typical open source drama + money and PoW.

The example you make about 2012 coin and 2018 coin is absolutely ridicoulous. It just makes zero sense. I mean read it yourself. Do you understand it? Timing indeed matters and the timing says that you are too late.  Don't get me wrong I made the same mistake. I use money I can miss but still there is a couple of thousands just holding different coins and I've been holding for about 3 years now and never got any of those coins in the plus. We are too late because we followed the hype. We didn't discovered the hype. What happen with Bitcoin will never happen again. And it's also very exaturated. People in Reddit talk about investing and being a millionaire. You've had to invest 10000 in the best time of bitcoin to become one. Nobody on Reddit has done this. The people on Reddit invest 1000 Max only talk about it like it's 50000.

"**Just-world hypothesis**

The just-world hypothesis or just-world fallacy is the cognitive bias (or assumption) that a person's actions are inherently inclined to bring morally fair and fitting consequences to that person, to the end of all noble actions being eventually rewarded and all evil actions eventually punished. In other words, the just-world hypothesis is the tendency to attribute consequences to—or expect consequences as the result of—a universal force that restores moral balance. This belief generally implies the existence of cosmic justice, destiny, divine providence, desert, stability, or order, and has high potential to result in fallacy, especially when used to rationalize people's misfortune on the grounds that they ""deserve"" it.

The hypothesis popularly appears in the English language in various figures of speech that imply guaranteed negative reprisal, such as: ""you got what was coming to you"", ""what goes around comes around"", ""chickens come home to roost"", and ""you reap what you sow"".

"You are unfortunately missing important context.

To understand where we are coming from you have to take into account several nuances of ""Bitcoin"" here. Bitcoin qua the design, Bitcoin as it existed before the split and ""Bitcoin"" as a particular chain is considered by ingroup preferences. 

The introduction post on BitcoinTalk.org (archived so you don't have to visit it, since it is operated by a big Bitcoin Cash opponent) clearly states that

&gt;Bitcoin Cash is a split from Bitcoin [the majority chain previous to the fork] with a protocol upgrade to fix on-chain capacity. If Bitcoin Cash gets majority of PoW then it becomes de facto Bitcoin.

&gt;It will be a[!] Bitcoin without segwit as soft fork, where upgrades of the protocol are done mainly through hard forks, without changing the economic rules of the Bitcoin.

brackets added to the original text by me for clarification.

It also lists first websites where it is possible to see Bitcoin Cash and then Bitcoin SL ""Core"" fees under two separate section headings, _both_ of which say

it's also the one example i know of an actual free market resulting in a monopoly rather than one being created by government barriers to competition; alcoa came up with a new method which was so good that they outcompete everyone else.  even though they gained this status by simply being good at what they were doing, they were taken to court for being a monopoly.

also i don't find gold or crypto similar use cases.  gold in the current financial system is best thought of as insurance and the currency of last resort.  it is basically super cash accepted everywhere as a result of human and monetary history.  it is the super store of value and that's all it is supposed to do, retain purchasing power.

meanwhile crypto like bitcoin is intended to be currency and compete/displace fiat.  it's not meant to be used as this super insurance but meant to be used for buying and selling goods, as well as saving, and as a feature of being a currency also act as a store of value.

i don't understand the economics of some that claim store of value first, then currency, as i don't believe any currency has ever done this, nor does it make any economic sense this could/would happen nor is there a reason to treat or even invent crypto as just a store of value.  neither i think is anyone using it this way anyway - some people get into it to try and use it as a proper currency/spend/replace, others HODL/speculate until moon/lambo.  but stores of value do not speculate until lambo - they are not about gaining purchasing power, they are about *preserving* purchasing power.",1525002170

"BCH's scaling plan is much more deterministic than ETH (by like 10000 times). That's because Ethereum not only has to worry about several attack vectors due to its turing completeness, but also because it has implemented a separate state tree, which is basically the selling point of ETH. To be fair, it IS cool, and I do root for Ethereum (I own Ether and have built a couple of Ethereum DApps), but the more I learn about the technology the more I find myself distancing away from Ethereum. 

Whereas Bitcoin is a model that has been proven to work for a decade. And its simple UTXO based model is really elegant. It's much easier to guess and control if things look like it will get out of hand. This is not possible with something like Ethereum because of its complex structure, which is why they're coming up with all kinds of convoluted scheme like you mentioned as well as multiple different convoluted approaches to scaling (sharding, sidechains, state channels, etc.), simultaneously.

I DO worry about the scaling issue but the reason I'm optimistic about this is because I believe in the genius of humanity. People will figure it out. Just because the extremely small number of developers think some problems are impossible to solve, doesn't mean it won't be impossible forever. ""Decentralized peer-to-peer money"" used to be an ""impossible"" problem too.

By increasing the block size, it creates more innovation opportunities, more opportunities creates more businesses, more businesses means more money. More money attracts more creative people. More creative people means someone will probably solve the problem.

Lastly, this scaling issue may not even be as bad as what people believe in. Nobody has seen it through so not a single person is qualified to make predictions with 100% conviction. It's all opinions. BCH people decide to believe that this will eventually work out, BTC people decide to believe the only way to scale is to be super conservative. Nobody knows what's the right answer. But I'm willing to bet both approaches still have 50/50 chance of success. And as a developer I personally like BCH more because I can see how I can actually contribute to the ecosystem instead of doing nothing but circle jerking with digital gold.",1525000612
"Utility is separate from value. Something can be intrinsically useful but not valued.

Oxygen is very useful to us human beings, but it is not valued. It is far too abundant to sustain a price. I you are under water and need an oxygen bottle to breath then it has tremendous value, but if you are on land in a clean country i is taken for granted and attributed no value becuase it is so abundant. 

In that sense utility, human desire and scarcity are what create value. Something doesnt just automatically have universal ""intrisic"" value because value is relative, all value is determined extrinsically. The term intrinsic value is a farce. Intrisic utility is far more correct, and just beause something has intrisic utility does not mean it will always be valued because of ""the paradox of value"".

"&gt;&amp;gt; I disagree, segwit only activated after a 2MB HF was promised, before that it had even less miner vote than Bitcoin Unlimited.

&gt;The majority of user and nodes wanted segwit. Miners activated segwit, and thought they had the authority to also increase blocksize. Turns out they didn't. The protocol spoke as segwit was activated.

Then why segwit took months (9!!) to reach activation level?

&gt;&amp;gt; Segwit was strongly contentious.

&gt;Only for miners who wanted to dictate rules. They activated in the end though.

Yes, proving that segwit didn’t have consensus.

&gt;&amp;gt; Their security is degraded to SPV security (they have to « trust » segwit transactions are valid), and they don’t propagate transactions anymore.

&gt;They don't even know what segwit tx are! 

Yes that’s the problem, you node will have them as valid without being able to check the signature data-&gt;SPV security.

&gt;They look like anyone-can-spend, except they cant. If you run a node and insist on using the old tx format without segwit you can absolutely do that. 

Yes but it doesn’t change the fact that you are not operating a full node anymore.

If you want to keep the same security level, you have to upgrade therefore segwit is not optional and behave in many as an HF that node can’t opt out.

&gt;&amp;gt; Segwit was contentious, that’s what led to the split.

&gt;Are you dense? Segwit was activated with 90+% miner support, 

Only when an agreement was found to add a 2MB HF.

&gt;plus segwit didn't cause a split. 

Why BCH then?

&gt;People who were not satisfied with segwit activation led to a split! 

Just like with an HF.

&gt;Its the same idiotic argument as me eating oatmeal for breakfast causes chain splits lol. Leave it, its a waste of time discussing.

Obviously a contentious upgrade, whatever SF or HF can lead to a split... you denying doesn’t change that fact.

&gt;&amp;gt; No the white say that difficulty algo much keep emission stable, which it does a better job at.

&gt;You have no clue how the system works. 

Check fork.lol

&gt;Sure, the its to keep emission and blocktime stable, but it serves a much more important use also: killing off forks with no concensus so we don't end up with a lot of shitcoins.

What prevent a fork to keep the same difficulty algo and reduce the difficulty by a factor of 100x  so that miner can produce quick block for a while?

If you fork, you can do whatever you want, BTC is not protected from that..

&amp;gt; Please elaborate.

&gt;The incentives as originally outlined was that miners have the biggest stake in the system, so they would of course run code that benefit the network, as they make most money that way. 

Correct

&gt;That incentive has been removed with the bcash DAA as it ensures all chains are viable - 

All chain are always viable anyway...

It is literally a one parameter change to ensure a minority chain get mined..

&gt;It doesn't matter if one chain has 1/10th the hashpower, both chains will be equally functional and miners are left with only a choice to mine based on price.

Exactly.

But this chain will be viable, without any programming skill.

&gt;(however relying on miners to activate softforks *actually* is more in line with the original vision).

"I can't speak for other exchanges but on binance when you sell you have 3 options: limit order, market order, and stop-limit.  

You need to choose stop-limit.  Now Btc is volatile atm so if I want to put in a stop-loss on my alt before bed I'll enter the Btc price I want to activate my stop-loss at into the 'stop' box.  And underneath that I'll enter the price (or better) I want to sell at in the 'limit' box.  And underneath that you put the amount you want to sell.

So for example the price of Nano atm is 0.0008265 btc.  So if I decide I want to protect my money against a dip I might decide to enter a stop at a price of 0.0008200 in 'stop'.  This will activate my limit sell order below which I might set at 0.0008190 in 'limit' below.  

Hopefully that helps.  But just bear in mind that bots do stop-loss hunt.  Sometimes you see random sudden dips on alts which I think might be due to whales mopping up some S-Ls.  So it's a bit of a catch 22 that I'm weary of.  Best thing to do is to probably NOT set your stop losses at predictable amounts like round numbers or just below, e.g. 0.0008200 or 0.0008199.

"There is no coin called ""Bitcoin Core"". It's Bitcoin. The Bitcoin haters use the name to confuse users.

Bcash (BCH), aka Bitcoin Cash, is an incompatible fork from Bitcoin. In a nutshell,

1. Bcash is basically a one-man's coin, although he has quite a few influential minions.

2. This man is Jihan Wu. He is owner of Bitmain, a mining hardware (aka miners) manufacturer that produces most of all miners in the world.

3. Bitmain's miners have a secretly embedded cheat named Covert AsicBoost, which gives Jihan's mining farms (but not his customers!) advantages in mining, which results in Bitmain's monopoly in mining industry.

4. Covert AsicBoost is unintentionally disabled by SegWit, a newly activated feature with many merits that gets intensively attacked.

5. Bcash was live at the same time as the beginning of the activation of SegWit.

6. Bcash is basically 100% Bitcoin, with SegWit removed, plus a minor modification claimed to be a better scaling solution.

7. Besides Covert AsicBoost, Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded backdoor named AntBleed. It gave Jihan the power to shutdown any Bitmain miner in the world remotely.

7. Jihan publicly stated he'd attack Bitcoin with his hashpower when Bcash was being created. (He controls a significant proportion of the overall hashpower.) He also implicated he'd use AntBleed in the attack.

Note that unlike the allegations about the devs who created SegWit, Covert AsicBoost and AntBleed have solid evidence and are acknowledged by Jihan/Bitmain.

By understanding who is behind Bcash and what he has done / what kind of person he is, you can draw a conclusion by yourself. This includes 1) why Bcash came into existence? 2) why they attack SegWit?

Bcash has few developers, of which none is well recognized, and near zero development activities. Bitcoin has more than 400 developers, of which some are well recognized world leading cryptography/cryptocurrency experts. It should be easy to draw the conclusion which is better without going into any technical detail.

The problem with Bcash is not about the technology at all, although its technology is inferior. It is not even about decentralization, which it fails totally, which makes it totally valueless. It's about it is created by a cheater (AsicBoost) and backdoorer (AntBleed). Few altcoins are more scammy than Bcash.

"What about Rentberry's token BERRY - it's missing from this list.

BERRY's market cap is currently at $25,000,000, and their 24-hr trade volume is about $1,300,000.  Their price has increased in the last 48hrs from $0.05 - 0.12 and then back down to $0.09.

Here's some of their fundamentals:

Rentberry raised $30,000,000 in their ICO, and $4,000,000 prior to that from investors. This put them as one of the most highly desired and widely adopted ICO’s of 2018 to-date.
The quality of the Rentberry core team is exceptional compared with a vast majority of other blockchain projects: Their CEO comes from a background of working at Cisco, Deloitte and several investment firms. Prior to this, he led a team that launched and successfully exited another tech startup before Rentberry. Their CTO holds a degree from Stanford in Management Science and Engineering, and has previously worked as an engineer for industry leaders such as Altera and Amazon Music. The rest of their team are roughly 40-strong, and many of which have worked together on projects for a number of years.
Rentberry has a vibrant and engaged community of participants and supporters - from their 28,000 Twitter followers, to the 15,000+ followers on their Telegram channel: Rentberry ICO
Much innovation is built directly into the Rentberry platform - one of the major reasons for the project garnering as much attention as they have. Blockchain tech will allow for high levels of transparency and accountability throughout the life cycles of every tenancy. During the application process, immutable records of all previous interactions of both the renter and landlord will be provided for each and an algorithmic-bidding system will be used by tenants to place bids on properties which they would like to lease.
One of the core features of the Rentberry platform will be the ability for BERRY token holders to collectively crowdfund the security deposits of tenants - allowing for renters to secure properties without such a high barrier to entry, and earning a passive income of roughly 7% for the lending token holders in the process.
Rentberry is a respected leader within the blockchain industry - gaining significant media exposure prior to their token offering, and being one of a minority of crypto-startups to launch their ICO with a pre-established platform in place. The Rentberry web app has been live for the past 3 years - and the tech being built into their service only enhances the functionality that already exists.
Rentberry are expanding internationally late in 2018, and will be offering global users the opportunity to leverage a range of innovative features when renting and leasing properties.
After being caught up in the months-long bear market at the beginning of 2018, many ICO’s participants watched as the value of BERRY moved lower with the rest of the market. 
A significant majority of those holding BERRY tokens today participated at roughly $0.33 during the ICO, and are avid supporters of the vision and future roadmap of the Rentberry Team. With such support, and after seeing much of the rest of the industry recover in recent weeks, BERRY could likely see a return to their ICO price and higher - meaning about a 5x increase in value compared to today’s price.
A number of highly anticipated announcements are just over the horizon at Rentberry, including partnership announcements, feature additions to their platform and the completion and launch of their mobile app in the coming months. For updates and direct access to announcements as they are made, one of the admin team on their Telegram channel will be able to direct you to their community announcement page.
And last but not least, unlike a number of crypto-projects that are here to raise what they can at ICO and then slip into obscurity, along with the hopes and dreams of their participants, the team behind Rentberry have a long-standing and proven track record, and continuously reiterate the importance they place in building quality and value into their platform.

In order to succeed, we needed these company to support it. And by every available metric,   most of these companies were neutral to slightly positive in favor of S2X.

"Heat in the sense that they are saying it is a stand-in for a generic ""thing needed to live."" One can replace it in their statement with ""shade from the sun"" or any other thing needed for proper life in a given area. The point is that things humans need to live and satisfy biological imperatives will always have value as, as far as normal circumstances go, living is the only known reason for living. We have a natural desire to go on living. One can argue that is not the meaning of life and that nature frequently showcases sacrifice, but it is one of the best models for life we have. In other words, the point is not the ""thing"", but rather its application to the situation and the need it is satisfying. To illustrate this, why have Bitcoin when we already have so many currencies? Because we value anonymous (somewhat anonymous anyway...) transactions independent of a governing body. Others do not value that, so they do not use Bitcoin, but it does not devalue the currency. It has its use and is valuable to those that give it value. ",1524996175

I'm happy to see adoption like this in the cryptospace! :D",1524995922
"No, certainly not! Both use storage, sure, but where storj etc are more of a cloud space rental kind of thing, burstcoin is a true crypto with a lot of great on-chain features like smart contracts and a built in asset exchange. Only 500x cleaner than pow. ",1524995745
"I see that they are accepting dollars through Coinbase, so the question is whether Coinbase accepts BCH payments directly from Tippr.  I don't want to open a Coinbase account or download any crypto wallet.",1524995677
"Could it be possible that in the future, LN coins might become slightly more valuable than non-LN coins and even more so as transaction fees increase. 

Let's say 1 BTC = 10,000$ and transaction fee to open a LN channel is 100$. So the cost of funding a new LN channel with 1 BTC is 100$. Instead you could re-use an old LN channel and buy 1 BTC for 10,050$ through the LN network and save 50$. So the LN coins are worth 10,050$ while non LN coins are worth 10,000$. The difference could become much larger if transaction fees increase a lot.

Does that make sense?",1524995604
"**Scientific method**

The Oxford Dictionaries Online defines the scientific method as ""a method or procedure that has characterized natural science since the 17th century, consisting in systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses"". Experiments are a procedure designed to test hypotheses. Experiments are an important tool of the scientific method. To be termed scientific, a method of inquiry is commonly based on empirical or measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning.

"I'm thinking of Ethereum as second generation after Bitcoin (first gen). It was a breakthrough in functionality but doesn't scale enough to run the massive global scale dApps that will define this industry soon. Sadly, the Ethereum team are also probably a victim of their own success, in the sense that the existing Ethereum has so many miners and altcoins hanging off it that making the radical changes required to make it scale will either happen in many small steps over a really long time, or fork the Ethereum community apart.

As a consequence, there are many new third generation platforms lining up to occupy that  gap in the market. Each takes their own approach, but gets to start fresh with scalable designs.

"Nice non sequitur. It doesn't mean the definition is pointless, it simply means that we're moving towards a world that has very little intrinsic value. Of course anything can have value, a digital picture of your mother might be very valuable to you but for everybody else it's worthless and useless.

"After having dug into all the low level tech details of different blockchains, my opinion is that most of the so called ""smart contract language"" blockchains are very likely to fail. This includes Ethereum (Even though I own Ether).

If this happens, the only coins that will be left standing are the simple ones with minimal additional feature sets that don't deviate from the original Bitcoin blockchain design (it's been proven to work for a decade).

And not many coins fit into this criteria, surprisingly. Most ""new age"" coins were created when ""Bitcoin isn't cool, it is blockchain that powers Bitcoin that's cool"" was the most popular meme, so they have a huge baggage of smart contract language and platform that creates a lot of vulnerabilities and attack surface.

So once you filter out all these turing complete smart contract platforms, and look at what's left at the top, Bitcoin cash is definitely very promising.",1524993551
"I started getting money into crypto in September, but I am not the most technical of users!

I generally use different exchanges for different things, namely:



Bitstamp and GDAX to buy and sell bitcoin, litecoin or ethereum.




Binance to buy other cryptocurrencies which I am interested in and are unavailable in GDAX (zero commissions on limit orders is hard to beat).





I usually try to keep my stacks in a mobile wallet (yes, not the most secure, but my lifestyle would be so much worse if I had to keep big pieces of paper around with me, as I travel a lot). I generally use different mobile wallets, but mainly using the Enjin Wallet, which is getting an update to import and create multiple wallets (with multiple mnemonic seeds) and that could prove useful.




I have thought about a hardware wallet in the past but I feel like that will just be another gadget to carry with me, and don't have enough skin in the game to be bothered to buy one.






I try to trade as little as possible, and mainly on the buy side. Overtrading is very much a thing in crypto, and you might be very much in the red due to it. A way to not feel pressed to trade is to just not have an available portfolio to look at, and leave your funds in a paper wallet.






My use case for bitcoin has been transactions to other parts of the world, and in the future would hopefully be related to Ln spending at markets etc, however, I mainly see the purpose of other cryptos (i.e Monero and the privacy bunch) as the better option for shady transactions, which were the main means of bitcoin trading before this speculative period.





So, TLDR: buy bitcoin in a good, cheap exchange (Bitstamp is quite alright), keep it in a wallet you trust and can keep with yourself, or just create the wallet and keep the words to recover it later, don't overtrade or daytrade (are there even ""days"" in a 24/7 market?)

Your idea is related to retail. And retail clients won’t be the game changer anyhow with regard to higher prices you argue with. 
Asset managers (pension-, hedge- and also retail funds) do not care about mBTC, Satoshi or whatever. They invest in multiples of Bitcoin. 

So I am with you that people have to be educated  Bitcoin is fractional. But they must do by theirselves, otherwise they shouldn’t invest anyhow. Understand your investment is key. 

And furthermore I do not like your argument more (retail) people could buy noting BTC is ‚cheap‘ due to fraction, as at the same time big guys maybe would say I won‘t invest in penny stocks.

And that is ""developer friendliness"" (or ""programmable money""). I've been watching what memo.cash has been doing and how supportive the community was towards the developers. And when I say ""community"", it's not just Reddit, but basically the core philosophy of the BCH chain itself in every way is very developer friendly. As a developer I think this is one huge difference that will trump everything else.

Today when you think about building something on top of BTC, you can just forget about doing anything on-chain, but the only way you will get attention is by working on virtue-signaling ""LApps"", and as a developer that's not something I want to build on top of. When you build apps on the lightning network, it feels like you're building on top of Twitter API (except that it's Lightning labs and Blockstream instead of Twitter, inc.) because no matter how they sell it, the future of lightning network is dependent on those two companies (or some centralized companies like coinbase or square taking over as a ""hub"")

"**Negative interest on excess reserves**

Negative interest on excess reserves is an instrument of unconventional monetary policy applied by central banks to encourage lending by making it costly for commercial banks to hold their excess reserves at central banks so they will lend more readily to the private sector. Such policy is usually associated with very slow economic growth, deflation, and deleverage.

During economic downturns, central banks often lower interest rates to stimulate growth. Until recently, it was thought that rates couldn't go below zero because people would hold on to cash instead of paying a fee to deposit it.

"&gt; I was assuming that they always allow a few free transaction like satoshi envisioned.

Satoshi had this idea that miners should always accept some free transactions.  I don't know why.  

Free transactions go against the assumption that most miners are selfish greedy bastards that only care about maximizing the expected revenue from the next block.  That assumption is essential to his argument that the protocol should work.  If one believes that most miners may do things that are not profitable, one cannot trust them to do anything specific.

&gt;  It seems to assume a hard limit. A soft limit allows

Manipulating the block size limit is a very awkward and unreliable way to implement fee policies.  The miner cannot guess which value will give the desired result, and the users cannot guess what fee will ensure confirmation in any specific time.  Using a variable soft limit instead of a fixed hard limit only increases the general confusion.

We saw that in the BTC network during the 2 years since the traffic hit the 1 MB limit: no one could make a fee estimator that worked, txs that paid $10 fee were delayed by six weeks and then confirmed together with other txs that paid pennies and were issued hours before...

The ""fee market"" that would let people control the delay by adjusting the fee was Greg's ""brilliant"" idea, but he never bothered to simulate it to see whether it would work.  Mike's article basically showed that the idea would fail, in a spectacular way.  That was not some original discovery, but elementary network theory.  

But Greg, who seems to be all thumbs with mathematics, refused to understand the warning, and stubbornly held the 1 MB limit for two years -- at the cost of alienating half the community, destroying the little merchant adoption that bitcoin still had, and finally causing a schism of the coin itself.   He was waiting for the ""fee market"" to appear, but there never was any sign of it.

If a miner wants to raise the fees, he should simply refuse to process any tx that pays less than that amount, but process any tx that pays above it, with no size limit -- and announce to the world, ""I have 20% of the hashpower and my tx fee is 30 sat/byte, no exceptions."" 

Then users will know that, if they want 10 min average delay they should pay 30 sat/B, and if they pay less the avg delay will be 12.5 min.  Depending on the parameters and market conditions, the miner may make more even though he will be skipping transactions that are still profitable.   

If all miners did that, with different min fees, there would be a functioning and sane fee market -- with no uncertainties, excessive or insufficient fees: everybody would get the (average) delay that they paid for.  With  ""unlimited"" blocks (size liimit MUCH larger than the normal block sizes)  there would be no need for miners to implement RBF and CPFP, because they would be useless.  ",1524991920

Sure scaling on-chain may have issues in the future if no other advancements occur somehow. Maybe when we mine the first 5GB block we discover a new issue that causes problems, maybe the chain grinds to a halt! Game over man, game over! 

Solution: the network sets a block size limit below the problem, then researches and fixes it. I think it's more likely that we never hit a ceiling like that, as other scaling improvements are also always moving in parallel, and if the network is adopted by hundreds of millions/billions, they will all be supporting finding the solution, not just a few dozen/hundred developers.

I've been reading your posts for quite some time and they're all very informative, even though there are a lot of things i disagree on (mainly about libertarianism). I haven't quite understood two things despite reading your comments:

1) You claim Greg &amp; co are artificially limiting the max blocksize because Greg believes it's the only way to secure the network as he wrote in 2013. Does this mean that you think he's doing this all because he desperately wants to save bitcoin?

Even if that is true and he is only acting to save bitcoin, don't you think that it's obvious even in case that Greg is right, 1mb is still not the ideal size for this. The network should be able to support A LOT more than what it can support right now, even after considering that a fee market needs to develop blockchain being a settlement layer. I mean, this should be very obvious for everyone. It should be even more obvious to Greg since he's been involved with this for a long time. Why do you think he's stubborn about even an increase to 2mb? I just can't understand this.

2) You mention that Bitcoin is already centralized, thus the only benefit of this inefficient payment system is already gone. I have been active in this whole cryptocurrency scene for a very short time, and that seemed very obvious to me since day one. Essentially, since mining blocks is a random process, luck/variance plays a significant factor in revenue, thus the need to join a pool as solo mining becomes impossible. However, don't you think the solution to this problem should be easy to find? Like, for example, reducing the block interval time so that variance can be reduced. Ideally, bitcoin mining should be like one pool, and every block reward should be split among miners according to the hashpower they provide to the network, in which case pools become obsolete.

It seems to me that it should be easy to implement such a change. However, I'm not a bitcoin expert nor a scientist, so I need your opinion on that.",1524991187

As for lightning.. among many issues with it, the routing problem is probably the biggest. It's extremely unlikely it will ever work without a few centralized payment hubs (and even there it might not work since value cannot be multiplexed across channels). 

Currently on the LN on mainnet, your $20 payment will fail to find a route 75% of the time. Your $100 payment will fail to find a route 99% of the time. 

This is not only NOT a long term solution, it's not a solution at all. It fundamentally does not work as a payment solution.

Anyone can look back and say what if I did this or that. The only real mistake you made was not keeping your btc keys. ,1524987204
"Only time will tell what the best scaling solution is, or who knows, maybe Bitcoin will be forgotten before it can ever truly be tested at scale. 

Maybe off-chain solutions are the best answer, but as of right now there's no working examples of any being superior to 0-conf onchain payments on a chain with enough capacity to keep fees to a minimum. 

No sense in limiting the amount of people who can use Bitcoin now, especially when there's headroom of many times over current demand to scale on-chain with no measurable centralization effects. Keeping Bitcoin limited to 1mb blocks is akin to a 5mph speed limit on the interstate, sure this allows the horse and buggies to safely use the roadway, but it's also 2018. ",1524987192

Im sure the internet police has this case on highest priority.

"Anyone that gets big off Bitcoin and tries to bite the hand that fed them, should suffer.",1524986959
"What is the difference between puting trust in Block.one and putting trust in ANY OTHER DEV TEAM FOR ANY OTHER CRYPTO. This type of FUD is useless, and baseless. Bring facts that matterialize in the real world. Any crypto can fail because of a fraudulent dev team. Most crypto devs probably work on many projects at once, and are not fully committed to one project. Think about that! Dan Larimer is the CTO of a huge company building a hugely funded open source project. During the EOS presentation in Seol South Korea, he didn't even come out to hype the project, he live streamed from his home in Virginia so he could focus on building the project. So you really need to do more homework on this and stop trying to convince people of risks they already understand.",1524986850
"Meaningless chart. Bitcoin could have went from $1 to $10 and the chart would look the similar.

The reality is that even with that specific time frame, Berkshire has added vast more value than Bitcoin. It's gone from $250B to $500B, whereas Bitcoin is only at $160B right now.",1524986844
Welcome to crypto.,1524986801
You're suprised a Bitcoin thread shits on iota? That's obviously going to happen. This sub shills iota so hard all the time AND cries about fud. The cries of fud are really just a manipulative shilling scheme. I honestly like the iota project never invested because of it's community.,1524986796

"Wow, this is surprising. The treatment of crypto in the media hasn't been very positive to say the least. I still meet many people who think that crypto is only for criminals, and this is sad.",1524986357

Because BTC is Bitcoin and BCH is Bitcoin cash.,1524986328

Once ppl find out that bch is the real bitcoin (smalls fees, fast transactions, no censorship) it will be over for bitcoin core.",1524986326

"If you send it to a BTC address, it will convert it into a bitcoin for you. rinse and repeat and you can make a lot of money fast!",1524986233
"If it was easy enough to buy, I would. That said, you don't need to own the SP500 to be diversified. It's a pain in the ass and BCH showed up with little to no effort.

A study was done last year that showed buying equal amounts of every single ICO yielded 1200% gains. No idea what that gain is now, but I'm sure it's still pretty damn good.

I for one have no idea what any of this shit will ultimately be worth and I also don't care. I'm willing to sell it all in a moments notice and let it go to $0 and disappear. All I want to own at the end of the day are assets of value -- bitcoin, shitcoin, usd, stocks, real estate... doesn't matter to me so long as it has a lot of value.",1524986229
"This is beginning to look like new stock market. Not sure if that's a good thing

Bitcoin futures finished the week on a winning note. The Cboe’s May contract XBTK8, -1.21%  finished up 0.6% at $9,150 and the CME Group Inc. April contract BTCK8, +0.84% which settled today, closed at $9,231, up 4.2% on the day.""",1524986216
"Fx mate. Fx. Read for the love of god. 

You know what your problem is ? You don't have the confidence to make a call. Now as someone who claims to have been trading stock in a market where you can't make a mistake, I ask myself why you don't have that confidence. It's because you're crap.

My call is BTC above $10k early to mid this week and above $12k before the end of the following week. I.ow's latest Sunday 2 weeks from now.
