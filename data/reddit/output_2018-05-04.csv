"Egon van Greyers is more a goldbug but his insights are not to be dismissed he says he will hold on to gold untill:

The financial system has been miraculously restructured and debt has vanished – IMPOSSIBLE
Major sovereign nations are running surpluses and have reduced debt substantially – NEVER
The financial system is backed by gold, guaranteeing the value of money – UNLIKELY
We can swap some of the gold for real assets at values 90-99% below today – LIKELY

Well I would advise him to add some bitcoin to his position.
Anyway I guess we both will do fine.

"Same as bitcoin.com :

Both belong to long term Bitcoin supports who grew frustrated with the politics and censorship within the Bitcoin community. Bitcoin grew as large as it is today because people started to use it for payments, however then the original vision was radically altered to a ""digital gold"" coin with high fees and unreliable confirmation times and a highly experimental, complex and not-ready lightning network on top.

If you really want to learn more about Bitcoin's history and the ""scaling debate"", which lead to the creation of Bitcoin Cash (that aims to fulfill the original vision of Satoshi Nakamoto) I'd suggest the following reads:

"&gt; Forks do not have a claim to the original name, if they did, the naming scheme wouldn't exist as it does.  As it stands, hash power at the time of the fork decides which chain is named what. 

I'm not sure this is fact.   What happens when hash power (price? market share?) shifts in the future?  It's been convention thus far because it's simply easier for a business to rebrand ... this again goes back to ideology since most forks are a straight up business decision.  This one is not.

"I have a bit of a theory about the IMF's positive stance on crypto from a bit of inside knowledge.

The head of the IMF, Christine Lagarde, has said many positive things about blockchain over the past year or so, more on that in a moment.

Gespard Koenig is a libertarian (french version) who is currently an adviser for Blue Frontiers, the seasteading company. He is a very popular political figure who knows his shit, going on TV letting the french know that the libertarian ideals are rooted in their French Revolution, he is like a young Ron Paul. He runs a libertarian think tank akin to Cato Institute in the US. He is very bullish on bitcoin and blockchain technology for it's libertarian implications.

Several years ago Gespard was the speech writer and adviser to Christine Lagarde. He still keeps in contact and has her ear. 

So in a way, the libertarian Gespard Koenig is keeping the IMF grounded when it comes to blockchain policy as the head of the IMF trusts his knowledge of blockchain technology and appears to be following through on his recommendations. ",1525503368

"I am a software engineer (I don’t own any BCH/BTC) and have already read Satoshi’s white paper multiple times since 2011. 

I also know the details of bitcoin from the highest level of abstraction (Economy, mining, transactions..etc) down to the lowest (Protocol, OPCodes, ECDSA, Maths behind Elliptic curves). 

I must say with all the objectivity that a human can have that :

From a conservative point of view: 

BTC of today has derived consistently from Satoshi’s white paper. 
BCH has applied thoroughly and simply Satoshi’s vision. (increasing transaction block size)

From a progressive point of view: 

BTC of today has evolved a lot and attracted a lot of innovation (eg: Segregated Witness,  Lightening Network)
BCH has applied minimal evolutions (Emergency Difficulty Adjustment, bigger blocks).

"Bitcoin will hit $250K+ this year.

I used to think the December-March crash was the result of savvy investors cashing out at the top. I'm now realizing that isn't the case. 

The crash happened because the market grew too fast for our infrastructure to handle. While crypto values can grow exponentially, exchanges can't KYC fast enough, bank transfers take too long, and people panicked because we haven't seen growth like we saw in 2017 - so we failed to meet the demands necessary to sustain the growth of the market.

Ladies and gentlemen, leaders like CZ of Binance saw this from behind the scenes and that's why he is focusing on decentralizing Binance. It's why the most successful crypto projects this year will be the ones that remove the human limitations and errors that led to our stalled growth in December (shout out to Switcheo for a quick shill but DEXes will thrive this year).

What makes me slightly nervous is the realization that our crypto infrastructure will improve and will be able to better handle the exponential growth inherent in something as deflationary, fast, and predictably unpredictable as the crypto market. 

If 2018 is the year we find a way to allow the market to grow exponentially without panicking and without our infrastructure failing to sustain the demand, then I believe last year is going to look like nothing compared to growth this year - at the very least we know what to expect whereas last year was a surprise. 

If you bought the dip aggressively over the past few months because you believe in crypto, then mathematical principles insist you will be very wealthy a year from now because you're already up several hundred percent and we are just getting started.

Also, I see no reason why Bitcoin can't hit $1 million this year because everything in this market happens faster than expected.",1525501978

Well when u intentionally label BCH bitcoin and were even selling it as such new people can be confused. Hell I’ve been in the space for a few years and never really visit d the subs /r/BTC or /r/bitcoin until recently cuz I had other interests and it was like completely different realities inside both which even confused me. But I remembered the whole block size debate and it made sense shortly after. For others it may not be so easy. I mean there’s already a learning curve when getting into crypto especially for the non tech savvy and all this does is create a greater barrier of confusion for those people. ,1525501235
"Bitcoin is made by Satoshi. He decides what's Bitcoin because of that. He released a white paper about what should be called Bitcoin. The current ""Bitcoin"" does not look at all like the one from the whitepaper. It might be better or worse, more popular, etc, but it's irrelevant.",1525501214

The abbreviation is there, it's BCH.

2) [Its own game token/ICO](https://bcash.games)

"Majority consensus has always been in favor of a higher block size. Miners signaled up to 90% for segwit 2x and since the bitcoin community splintered in to all these alt coins, bitcoin with a small block size is only supported by a minority of the original bitcoin community. Bitcoin Cash is also a minority, there is no big majority anymore even though through propaganda and shilling that's why some people within bitcoin with a small block size want you to believe.

"The point of crypto always has been and always will be decentralization, it's the only reason you would use crypto over a centralized service like Venmo or Square or the many other free, fast solutions available.

Cryptocurrency is about creating a system of money that can function securely without the need for a trusted third party like a bank or government or private company.",1525501141
It's not about fiat at all. Just shorting or longing bitcoin which is very usefull for trading. For example if the market starts to drop you cannot really trade alts but you can short btc to maximize gains,1525501129

"You're forgetting a whole heap of these dingbats sold their Bitcoin (BCH) for next to nothing straight after the fork because of the heavy propaganda campaign telling them to do so. Do you remember how many spammy threads were created on crypto subs, twitter, etc saying how good it is they're all getting 'free money' from selling their BCH. All I can say is thanks for the free money, I bought your BCH for $200-300, in fact the cheapest Bitcoin (BCH) I purchased was $175, what a steal.

You're asking them to admit they're wrong and they won't admit it till Bitcoin Cash overtakes Bcore, which is inevitable. I feel sorry for these people but if they hadn't let their emotions run wild and thought independently they'd still have their real Bitcoin (BCH).

"Bingo. r/Bitcoin can be censored, and BTC can still be the true Bitcoin. There's no logic that makes it only one or the other",1525500741
"Just a quick note about this whole old tech, myspace of crypto etc.  There are a few advantages of bitcoin that I think most people don't really appreciate:    

-it has been by far the most targeted crypto (because there is the most money to gain), and it has survived it all.  If any of the newcomers with 'superior tech' were to become the biggest marketcap crypto, they might find out just how difficult it is to excel with every hacker and network spammer trying to expoit them    

-It has the smallest attack vector.  If digital gold is really to be a thing, there's something to be said about having it be the coin that can do just that, instead of something that can do more like ethereum but that can result in everyone's money being stolen in something like a DAO hack    

I don't think the analogy to web technologies is quite appropriate, because there's a good reason to have a coin that does only one thing and does it securely.  With any of the proven blockchain technologies (at least as far as I know) there's currently a tradeoff between security and functionality (speed, transaction fees).    

Bitcoin may very well be overtaken, but I don't think it's as sure of a thing as it is in something like social media where people don't really care as much about privacy and security and will end up going along with new tech that offers them more functionality.  When people's savings are on the line, I think it's very possible that something as secure as bitcoin may never lose it's network effect and play the role of digital gold.",1525500687

Where am I backtracking?

&gt;Imagine if everyone sold their crypto today, 400 billion will never be extracted from this market. That mtgox custodian guy sold 0.2% of all coins and crashed the market 70%, total money extracted was less than $20million.

But everyone will not sell all their crypto in one go so it's a silly hypothesis. Anyway coins can be auctioned or sold face to face without anyone knowing and not affect the market.

Right, I'm sure they are not worried about crypto. Just as the music industry wasn't worried about Napster and Pirate Bay. They are fools if they are not concerned.

"The fact is I don't own a single Satoshi out of BCH/BTC, as I believe that in longer run Monero will be the winner. BTC should lose his true bitcoin name, the last bull run of crypto showed that BTC is a hostage of blockstream. And that definitely ain't the desirable situation. Big corporation tries to get rid of BTC the same way that central banks, got rid of gold, putting the second layer, that's more practical than clogged on purpose bitcoin. In the longer run, lazy people will use mainly LN-BTC, and infrastructure will be built outside of blockchain. Only cryptoilliterate people would support that. If you are in crypto for at least 3 years, you could have seen the slow change of the narrative, to overcrowd bitcoin and give the name of ""some sort of gold"".

"I have to completely disagree with you.

Can't find 1 compelling reason why limiting the block size to 1mb is a good idea. If the 2x fork went through there would likely not even be a debate about BCH at all. And as op in this comment chain said, if Bitcoin Core/blockstream hadn't bungled the implementation and use case of Bitcoin as a currency BTC would be far ahead in growing adoption and not just being a stupid investment vehicle preying on FOMOers. Shit is perverse and say what you want about BCH, it is trying to be implemented as a currency, which *is* what Bitcoin is all about, and only through that use case will this shit even be worth talking about it. Fuck blockstream, fuck Bitcoin core and all the people yelling fraud this and fraud that, let the market decide who the winner is, BTC will continue to shoot itself in the foot and we will see what rises up from the crowd.

Regardless of how you or I feel about things, people can do business with BCH with their phone wallets for $0.01 *instant* transactions.  And no, if BTC had ""empty"" blocks like BCH, it still wouldn't have instant transactions because that functionality was crippled on BTC like many things that BCH brought back.

This topic is about how the tweet by @Bitcoin attempts to imply otherwise with careful phrasing.

Correct me if I’m wrong, but from what I can see, BTC people are accusing BCH people of misleading people to believe they’re  directly associated with Bitcoin Core (if not actually investing in Bitcoin Core). Where as BCH enthusiasts feel they have superior technology and are victims of a smear campaign by BTC enthusiasts.

Briefly looking at the BCH website and taking their name into consideration, it does seem pretty damn deceptive and probably shiesty with how similar they brand themselves to Bitcoin. At the very least, it feels douchy. And I don’t want to invest in a douchy team or brand. So for that reason I will probably never invest in BCH unless I’m proven they’re not douchy.

On the other hand, BTC devotees seem to act superior as hell. And they also tend to never admit any other crypto tech has comparable or better potential....which BCH very may well have. Their technology feels like the MySpace of the crypto world at this point. It’s old news. It’s boring. For that reason, I will probably never invest in BTC directly.

"This Brad Mills guy reached out to me on Telegram a couple weeks ago to ""try and understand"" where we are coming from.  Apparently he and I have some similar TG channels and he'd seen me expressing thoughts.

First off let me point something out that this person fails to tell anyone.  He wasn't here during the most crucial years when this entire debate was being formed.   When the entire community and industry leaders were asking Core devs what the actual fuck they were doing, and why they weren't scaling Bitcoin.   

He wasn't here when Adam Back, Andreas Antonopoulos, and others said themselves that Bitcoin must have block size raised at least to 4, 6, or 8 MB while we work on Layer 2 solutions.   He wasn't here when deals were made by Core and broken.  And he wasn't here when Blockstream swooped in and convinced Greg et al to nix the on-chain scaling needs so they could get fithy rich.

Since Brad was not here for any of this, and in fact entered the space no greater than 1 year ago (he claims he was here since 2012, but it was merely having heard of BItcoin), this guy has no understanding of what this entire thing is all about, from a non-punch drunk censorship viewpoint.  

I can assure you that I engaged this guy in literal hours of the most respectful, articulate, rational, reasonable explanations for our side of the debate as could be humanly possible.  I worked through things point by point with him.  But I found after a very short period of time that he simply was not listening.  Nothing I said would be responded-to or acknowledged.   I had to corner him several times and repeat my question without acknowledging anything he said, simply to try and force a response out of him on what I was asking.

My favorite part was when I simply asked him point blank why Core, who was pro small bump in block size, suddenly nixed that plan when Blockstream happened on the scene.  Why didn't they simply raise it a little bit, and utterly prevent BCH from ever existing?  In fact why don't they raise it right now, and kill BCH in its tracks overnight?  My point of course was that this is about Blockstream profiting off killing Bitcoin and forcing transactions through their ""product"".  Despite repeating this question 10x he never responded.  

He would listen to me present a bullet-proof 3 minute audio explanation for something that would even tug at the heart of the hardest man for Bitcoins Social purpose in the world, and he would literally pick one word I said out of the entire 3 minutes that wasn't 100% correct, hyper-focus on it, and ignore the rest of the 3 minutes of information.

It became very obvious after a very short period of time that this guy was not interested in learning anything.  He was interested in reinforcing his biases.   He would latch onto anything I said that sounded Craig or Roger-esque and tell me that we all think the same.  Anything speculative I said, was ""proof"" that we are all paranoid delusional conspiracy theorists. 

Its difficult to explain how this conversation went, but I think you get the idea. I consider myself an extremely articulate person by voice, and I have 3 hours a day for the last 7 years of watching this thing play out, under my belt. I conveyed every detail of every part of this mess to him, and it was like talking to a brick wall.  He acknolwedged nothing.  Conceded to nothing. And as mentioned, isolated irrelevant issues while disregarding the overall point.  

Yet he talks incessantly on twitter about ""cognitive dissonance"".   Ill give him props for remaining respectful as I slowly grew more and more angry.  But when you're knowingly playing dumb and ignoring points as you take someone round and round in circles ... its a lot easier to remain calm.  Because of the disengenuous nature of what you are doing in the first place.

TLDR:  This guy is practically a ring-leader of shit talking on Twitter, but when faced with an offline, respectful, and (i dont give a shit) insanely reasonable articulate presentation of our ""side"" ... he was completely immune to it all.  

Sorry for the ramble/rant.

""You guys"" is an interesting phrase, because it's almost evolving to become gender neutral. I personally don't mind hearing it. Would you also refer to an all-female group as ""boys""? My guess is not, and that's why I think ""you guys"" is a bit unique.

&gt; I guess it just comes across to me as SJW bs whenever someone brings it up at all unless someone was being clearly sexist. This idea that everyone needs to be inclusive of everyone with all the language they use just never sat right with me. Most of the people getting offended when it comes up seem to be placing a meaning on it that was never there in the first place.

It's disappointing that the majority will automatically dismiss discussions like this as ""SJW"" without giving it a second thought. No one is saying you HAVE TO do anything, but more just trying to raise awareness so that everyone can feel welcome. 

At the end of the day, the crypto subreddit does not have to be an all-welcoming place, but wouldn't it be nice if it was? I mean we're using international currencies here, it doesn't get much more inclusive than that so why unintentionally exclude people?",1525496705

Your example is completely off, unfortunately, and you might want to keep correcting it until it somehow works, but it's a waste of time because it doesn't get to the crux of the issue, which I have outlined clearly.

The crux of the issue is, if a coin forks, does it immediately lose its original name due to the fork?  The entire world has agreed in every single case, that it does not.  The only area where there is any contention, is with bitcoin, and it's only because of Vers propaganda tactics.

So lets get back to your gold example and why it's way off.  Is the gold coated in led the bitcoin, or is the old certificate the bitcoin?  It's such a flawed analogy that I can't even find a way to argue it because it doesn't make any sense.",1525496125

"I've never been a fan of Roger Ver.  I don't make a ton of comments on reddit, but when I do... and when they are about BCash, they're always negative.  Go check my post history if you want.

But I am going to make a bold prediction right now.  I predict that Bitcoin Cash is going to win the branding war for the title of Bitcoin.  Bitcoin isn't putting up enough of a fight against Bitcoin Cash.  Go check out the two websites, bitcoin.org and bitcoin.com.  Then tell me which one you think looks more appealing to new people.  bitcoin.org looks like an internal wiki project at a software company that has links to documentation and lists of tasks for their programmers to complete.  bitcoin.com blasts you right away with a link to their wallet.  Anyone who downloads that wallet will now think that their chain is the real Bitcoin as we've all seen from the screenshots.  And then you scroll down their website and there is just so much information and it is organized like a modern website, i.e., *optimized for mobile*.  In the future, when we all carry our money around on our phones, which domain is going to make it easier to digest their information?  I'm scared, guys.  Roger Ver is going to win and I can see it coming and I feel useless to stop it.

The problem is that Bitcoin Cash is fighting a war and Bitcoin isn't.  BCH's side is hungrier and need the win and is actually organized and centralized enough to put forth a concerted effort.  BTC, on the other hand, is so decentralized that either no one dares to or noone has succeeded at becoming its spokesman.  Bitcoin Cash has a recognizable spokesman in Roger Ver and Bitcoin has Anonymous.  

Remember that people entering the market right now have next to zero knowledge of Bitcoin's history.  All they know is that when their friends tried to buy Bitcoin from bitcoin.org last December and it was slow and cost too much, that when google directs them to bitcoin.com now, they will end up with a currency that is faster and cheaper.  They'll think ""Oh, this must have been the upgrade I keep reading about on bitcoin.com.  Thank goodness I never got duped by Bitcoin Core.  I've got the good stuff!""

I only hope that the big money from investment bankers is also the smart money and that they have done their research and actually understand the market's history enough to know that Bitcoin Cash has been defrauding people left and right.  Then the big money will rightfully invest in the original chain, BTC.  When I catch myself rooting for the bankers though, isn't that exactly what Bitcoin was supposed to be fighting against?  Bitcoin was supposed to be the currency of the masses, not the banks and hedge funds.  When I'm rooting for the government to step in and send people to prison over trying to define their own currency?  Bitcoin was supposed to be the currency of the masses, not the governments.

So when the new arrivals (i.e., the common folk) choose BCH over BTC, while the investment bankers and the government are choosing BTC over BCH, shouldn't I be true to my anarcho-capitalist roots and embrace Bitcoin Cash over Bitcoin?  I fear the monster that I will become.

p2p online payments for internet commerce is what the white paper talks about.

Such as an online shopper doing business with an online merchant without having to rely on a trusted institution such as a payment processor like Authorize.net.

The whitepaper talks about solving the problem with payment uncertainties (&amp; costs) associated with internet commerce, problems that are usually avoided when dealing in person, with physical cash. 


Crypto can certainly be used in person, but according to the white paper it's intentions (or at least the original use case) is to remove the trusted institution typically in between 2 parties while engaging in internet commerce... 

...aka an online merchant doesn't have to worry about charge backs, they aren't required to collect a ton of information, and they can avoid the costs associated with accepting online payments.


From what I can tell,  the white paper referring to ""peer to peer cash"" has nothing to do with in-person transactions.

It's a soft fork, which is an upgrade mechanism satoshi used a half dozen times, from his fix of the integer overflow attack, to his fix of the vulnerability which made it so anyone can redeem any transaction.

Soft forks have been used by the core developers to introduce P2SH (used in whats sometimes called a ""multisig address""), and the fix for the database bug in 0.7. It was also used to remove a critical vulnerability caused by open ssl not being consensus-guaranteeing.

Then segwit was added to increase the transaction throughput, decrease the size of the utxo database, and to make malleability optional.

Both BTC and BCH follow the same protocol, but neither is the same as it was before the fork.

I’m not saying they shouldn’t prevent people from buying crypto on credit because they should. I’m saying credit card company’s  want people to default  and miss their due dates so they can collect interest. If everyone paid in time they’d fail. I think the higher fees for that type of purchase is why they made so much when people were buying. That said I was amazed when people threw a fit about them stopping people from being able to buy crypto on credit. The. I realized everyone who threw a fit was either young or completely new to investing. No stock broker will let you use a credit card to buy stocks (or more no credit card company will allow you) so this is nothing new. And stocks are way less risky then crypto so even more the reason.

It is expected that technology will advance faster then transactional load. The blocksize limit, as you mentioned, is spam protection. It will be increased as usage demands.

With enough transactions, the IOTA can become slow and expensive as well. Just because you are not paying for a transaction fee doesn't mean you have unlimited free processing power and bandwidth.

But, like gold, a true long-term store of value, requires reputation. It requires a past, history. Bitcoin is the only one of all of them that has that. There will be no newcomers to that role. If there is to be a digital store of value, a kin to gold, it will be bitcoin. ",1525485746

Oh and look at all the coins you can directly exchange into fiat.  Seriously, fuck Coinbase.

Couple this with the fact that Coinbase have barely any coins to trade.  Just imagine if that Thai site decide to open a US site (with the assistance of companies like Deloitte and OMG) with the same charges etc.  It'd close Coinbase overnight.

Also, your point number 6.  I agree that this will happen, but right now all of crypto is heading the wrong way.  It isn't privacy that is required at all, but fully 100% trackable cryptocurrencies, where no trade can be hidden, mixed or fucked about with, that gives full transaction details right on the blockchain.  Securities laws requires this.  You cannot fuck about on stock exchanges any longer.  The big players make tons of money because when you're shifting billions of dollars and making 0.034% gain per transaction, you're making a stack of cash, especially as you are directly plumbed into the exchange and have minimal fees.  It is these institutions that have made it hard for small investors to make money, they'll do the same with crypto.  

You think the early investors are going to run off with the cream?  They won't.  The banks in collusion with Government will adopt blockchain, but it'll be their own and guess what?  It'll be open first to monster investors (those banks, financial institutions and Governments) to tx their wealth into whatever crypto they have invented, after which it will open to big corporate investors, after a long time it will open to the public, but it'll be a simple tx from the money stored in your bank to the new currency.  

Oh and all the crypto that's around today will be outlawed.  If you're caught with so much as a bytecoin you'll face jail.  Nope, we are all merely carrying out a gigantic beta test to find the best tech.  Once it's found, they'll copy it, improve upon it, and then implement it.

"In an economy of truly sound money it is.

I don't think you're understanding the point entirely. When you save money (even if you just stick cash in a safe -- or bitcoins in a cold wallet) you are forgoing your right to make an immediate claim on a certain amount of *stuff* in the real world today. To use another example, if you have enough money to buy a car today but hold off buying the car for a year, that car is still available to be immediately used by someone else. You have effectively loaned it to them. (the key is to remember that money isn't wealth, but merely a means of accounting for the exchange of wealth.. its an IOU)

Deflation *is* a form of interest in a sound money economy, or at least that is what I'm trying to get you to conceptualize with the saving is lending statement.

You're lending out the goods and services that you produced to earn your monetary income, not the goods and services that you might buy in the future.


It's just an interesting way of thinking about it as a lot of people seem to think that an economy built on deflationary currency will not work because it incentivizes people to save or hoard their money. People have been taught that inflation is necessary and I don't believe that to be true.

You have to remember that money isn't wealth, and bitcoin isn't the end of the line.",1525485093

For example, prepaid mobile credit, people keep buying mobile credit once their hours are up, it's a continuous cycle to buy and replenish. Hence, this will cause BCH demand to grow overtime. BCH itself will become a business channel to build apps and fuel payments for apps. There's no other blockchain that does this, the closest we have is ethereum where people buy ico/tokens and then replenish ethereum to fuel smart contracts and in-chain transactions like crypto kitties.

"Yeah, you are probably right. Though sometimes I do wonder about the ideological/political split in this whole thing. At first BTC was all amount protect network security (light nodes and don't let miners have too much power), then BCH was like, no miner are key to security, and the incentive works for the benefit of all. Then BCH did the whole BTV doesn't care for social good thing (which was a bit bizarre), while you also have the whole BCH should be Turing complete so that the network can be the case for a whole ecosystem (valid goal, if questionable). It like ideologies shift and morph so quickly, and nobody really know what they want (deep down people either want to get rich, or develop something for social good). You can have both, sure, but it's the order of events then, and how you believe the motive hierarchy should settle. 

Ideological leanings define a lot about people, whether they are aware or not (the majority aren't, or don't know, or are clouded by greed/ego at new found wealth at this point). 

Sometimes it's hard to figure out with splits/forks (ETH is a very good example as well here). 

It's very complicated, and if you asked any one person, you would probably not get a broad idea of the whole group at all, yet everyone coalesces towards some vague notion of a common goal (each person having a different perspective of what that is). 

It seems to me that further splits are inevitable (and probably on both sides and all chains). 

I just wonder if the continual splitting is just diluting the overall affect that crypto can have on society, diluting the affect of social good, or at least delaying the process. 

Each segment of society wants something different, and the medium (crypto) allows fractioning relatively easy. I wonder if it is healthy, or in the future will there just be atomic swaps, and it really won't matter an iota what ideologies there are. 

The only thing that may matter is the relative exchange rates (which will probably be driven by security - hash rate (haven't a notion where this power is going to come from? The sun?), code security (netsec, cybersec, quantum proofing, and malefactors), and I guess utility (though atomic swaps may even reduce utility differentiation). 

network effect will also be meaninglessness as atomic  swaps will ensure everyone is connected 24/7 and interface improvements will probably flatline (unless maybe we go AI/HCI/Utility radical like mind money, thought money, time money, emotion money, political money, love money or something crazy like that).

"**Halting problem**

In computability theory, the halting problem is the problem of determining, from a description of an arbitrary computer program and an input, whether the program will finish running or continue to run forever.

Alan Turing proved in 1936 that a general algorithm to solve the halting problem for all possible program-input pairs cannot exist. A key part of the proof was a mathematical definition of a computer and program, which became known as a Turing machine; the halting problem is undecidable over Turing machines. It is one of the first examples of a decision problem.

"Can this ""Crypto == new internet"" comparison bullshit just stop?

Because no. It's not right.

The internet orginated from (local) computer networks that were _immensely useful by themselves immediately_. And they became even more useful when linked up over a wider area.

It took close to 3 decades of technological development before the dotcom bubble happened.

As for cryptocurrencies? We're a decade in, and the amount of stores that accept them is still _abysmal_. And this shouldn't really come as a surprise, the benefits of cryptocurrencies are _vastly overstated_.

* ""Lower fees"" is wrong. As the Bitcoin paper points out, you're going to need to have an escrow provider, and that escrow provider is going to charge fees, _higher ones than banks &amp; paypal_ as escrow providers need pay for shipping from their warehouse to the buyer.

* ""Take back the economy from the central banks"" is even more wrong. First, the idea that governments would even let you is laughable. (And yes, they most certainly _can_ enforce bans that prevent stores from accepting cryptocurrency) But even besides that, _the idea of taking back control is flawed conceptually_. The supporters of the ""DOWN WITH CENTRAL BANKS"" drivel fell into the same pitfall as a lot of libertarians; Ignoring history. **Central banks didn't take away control of the currency from society. Society gave it to the central banks because the gold standard kept causing economic problems.**

And just to pre-empt one of the more predictable comments. _No. Smart contracts cannot fill the role of an escrow provider._ For one, _you can't stick physical packages in a smart contract_, and as for digital goods, you won't prevent piracy. A smart contract movie store would just immediately result in someone re-uploading say... the latest Star Wars movie and undercutting Disney by 50%, and your smart contract network isn't going to survive Disney throwing their entire slush fund at the job of shutting it down.",1525479017

"The only broken premises here are yours. You literally didn't understand a single thing about Bitcoin.

**1 LOL nope, there's absolutely no trust involved in SPV**

What an SPV node ""trusts"" is that:

* He's connected to at least 1 honest node, which is always true and also required for full nodes
* Ensuring that there's no chain split/incoming reorg, which can be easily checked with blocktime or data sent by other nodes
* There's not a 51&amp;#37; attack ongoing, same for full nodes, which is always true thanks to economic incentives
* Nobody can intentionally forge a block just to trick you \(if unintentional then it falls to point 2\); which is always true due to PoW \+ statistics \+ economic incentives.

That's all, nothing more that a normal non\-mining full node

**2 LOL nope, your ""thousands of refs"" cannot remove the main refs**

Why? Because the main ref have hashpower and can continue their chain while the ""thousand of refs"" don't have any and can't continue their chain. They can decide that some blocks are invalid, so what? Their chain is dead, all they did was orphan themselves. They're obviously spectators, they can boo all they want but nothing's gonna change; that's actually the most fitting example to show that ""voting with hashpower"" impliest no hashpower = no right to vote.

**3 LOL nope, a swarm of bees all controlled by the bee queen is still centralized**

It's easy. Core claims that ""we can't have big blocks because that'll centralize Bitcoin, so we use our better X solution"". To prove this claim they need to do 3 steps:

1. provide formal definition of ""decentralization""
2. provide formal proof that big blocks will cause a significant loss of ""decentralization""
3. provide formal proof that the solution X will cause less loss of ""decentralization"" than big blocks

That's not ""define the color blue"" philosophical yadda yadda. That's **science**, and Rick noted that Core still hasn't fulfilled step 1 but religiously believe in that claim out of pure faith.

&gt; AU FUCKING CONTRAIRE!!! Comcast is **THE** argument 

No it isn't. Said user is **deliberately choosing** a shitty connection when he could easily upgrade to something of this era. And no, sorry, I've never heard of an engineer that makes a car with the worst case scenario of ""encountering a velociraptor"" or ""having to change the engine with a steam powered one""; that's because both are part of another era and ""I can't run world\-scale services on my shitty Comcast connection, and therefore, the world must suffer for it"" it's a laughable statement for every single engineering product on Earth.

No, they become *extremely* large but not *infinitely* large, thanks to pruning and checkpointing. Hell, even without checkpointing, avaiable storage grows faster than the blockchain does.",1525478778
"Don't worry, I have no interest in arguing how to scale the thing either. I put enough thought into it for a lifetime. My assumption years ago (2013ish) was that we'd do a blocksize increase because it was well understood, we knew how to implement and detect if things went to shit, it didn't require substantial re-tooling of wallets or protocol, and it didn't require any change in cryptography or game theory concerns.

That absolutely does not mean it's the best answer (although it's certainly an easy one). I met some of the core Bitcoin team at BPASE18 Stanford (g.maxwell, p.wuille, c.allen), and a ton of other highly intelligent developers for other cryptocurrencies, and they're all definitely smarter (and more creative) than I am where they specialize, including those seriously concerned with scaling. There was an extremely low percentage of bullshitting there, which was refreshing. That really restored my faith in the future potential of cryptocurrencies.

Anyway...

I would argue that the immediate usability of a system only matters in the present context. If BitTorrent traffic crawls to sub-10kbps network-wide nobody is going to care that it ran even slower at some point 3 months ago. Same with Amazon (AWS, making up a huge percentage of the internet); if they had a 100% outage for an hour two months ago and today the latency is up to multi-second response times, we, the users, are only going to care about it running slow right now, not that it was even slower months ago.

In software engineering, the ramp up to the sudden drop in performance is interesting because now we can more easily correlate cause and address it. Except this information is useless in this context because we already know cause and addressing it in this case has been a silly clusterfuck for years. So all this post means is ""shit is fucked or going to be fucked again soon"". I don't need a 6 month graph to predict or diagnose that, I need a 48 hour one. I was staring at mempool graphs in 2013, and they never went farther back than than a month (usually a week). I needed to prep my clients and customer support of the inevitable fuckstorm that was incoming.

The rise and fall of the system from usable to unusable to usable again over a 6 month period doesn't matter unless you're doing some sort of post-mortem. Either the system is acceptable to end user's tolerances or not at present time. If it's a store of value it's acceptable (probably) since it's being used for settlement (low volume, high value), if it's a currency it's absolutely not (high volume, all values).

Not sure what you mean by ""the adversary"". I already made it clear I'm not arguing for either side, and that this post is a useful heads up to those that have to deal with the fallout of stuck transactions from end users. You can't post this graph or demonstrate any similar sentiment on /r/Bitcoin without being banned, so where else would you have this message be broadcasted for the Bitcoin community?

People (generally) react in specific ways when confronted with a stimulus, and once you recognize the typical reaction you can plan for it.  In the case of poker I took advantage of that fact to control the table because I knew what the majority of the table (as individuals) would do in response to other actions taken at the table.  After a certain point I noticed that this was the case even when you couldn't see body language.  In online games people would still exhibit tells through acting in predictable ways - and again, when you can predict responses with limited information you're ahead of the game.  Groups are (typically) easier to read than individuals.  People will conform to the group.  ""XYZ is mooning! Buy! SCAM SELL SELL!!!!""

I'm by no means an expert - but I've seen the same thing since I've started trading.  ""Buy the rumor, sell the news"" is an example of that in action.  Hype builds up, and more people buy in.  If you get in early, which often you can do if you do some research, you can ride that out and sell before things turn the other direction.  The opposite is true as well, a few people panic selling can trigger massive drops in price.  

**Important:** If you miss the news and the currency has already jumped up a lot, wait it out.  You missed your chance - but there are tons of other opportunities out there.  If you jump in too late it's entirely the fear of missing out, and you're playing a much riskier game.  You might be buying just when the sentiment has started turning to sell... and when that drop happens you're going to lose.

That's how I started (trading news), and it worked out alright, but not as well as I would have liked because I didn't have much cash to throw into it.  So I went from looking for news that I thought would have a positive impact to looking for patterns.  While there's merit to saying that there aren't patterns and that past performance is not indicative of future performance, you *can* still exploit patterns - because there are some there.

In my case I look for currencies which have relatively minor fluctuations in price and low value.  It doesn't matter (for trading) if the crypto has utility, was designed for pump and dump, or is just a complete ""shit coin.""  Optimally, you will be buying and selling quickly (you need decent trading volume), so the true value is irrelevant because it isn't an investment.  

The lower the value of the currency the higher the percentage of gains **and losses**.  What that means practically speaking is if you see a slight upward movement you could be pulling in a lot of profit.

**The most important aspect to that is having solid risk management.**  Yes, if you hold for a longer period of time it's *possible* you might recover if you start taking losses.  On the other hand, it's also possible you might lose a lot more.  So it's important to set limits in **each** direction and sell if you hit either of those points.  Yes, you might lose potential profit, and you might end up selling the bottom of a dip here and there - but it's better than the alternative (holding on while you lose 50% of the value, or waiting for more profit and getting hit with a massive correction for instance).  If I'm sure the price will recover, I'll just buy in lower.  If it drops more and doesn't look like it's recovering (again), rinse and repeat or move to something else until I feel more confident.

I can't reiterate the importance of risk management enough though.  You **have** to know when to cut your losses in any risky business (poker or trading).  If you convince yourself that you're committed, you **will** just lose everything - it's just a matter of time.  Nothing will convince someone to give all their money away quicker than the feeling that they're going to keep winning.

I had a guy go off on a rant one time at a table - he just went on and on about ""Who the hell folds pocket aces!?""  I'd pushed most people out preflop - but once the flop hit it was obvious (to me) that he had a straight flush (iirc).  So when it got to me, I didn't even bother calling.  I knew I was beat, I had a single pair and had no chance of taking the pot.  He was pissed because I didn't call and give him more money, which most amateurs would do hoping for a lucky turn and river, but as it turned out I wasn't an amateur.  The one truth is once you commit money, it's no longer yours.  From there on it's all about whether or not you think you can take what's in the pot with what you've got - and I knew I couldn't.  I lost 6-8x the blind, but I walked away with everything I still had in my possession, which mean I stood a chance of making everything and more back.  That's exactly what I did later that night doing the exact same thing.  A guy kept saying ""just for fun"" when I folded worthless hands preflop.  Eventually I caught a solid preflop hand so I shrugged and said, ""just for fun.""  Flop came down and there was no way to lose the hand... so I checked.  Since I was actually playing, he threw out a token bet and I said, ""why not?""  What was actually happening, is he was convinced I had another worthless hand, and he could just keep chipping away at my stack (and take more of my money).  I wasn't confident (in my made hand) so he was convinced he was still winning.  On the turn, I threw out a small bet, just to make him think I was trying to (poorly) bluff.  So he called.  On the river, I did it again... so he raises, I reraise, and he calls.  There's no way I could win, he'd walked away with small amounts of my cash over and over... until suddenly I took everything he had.  He got so drunk on his successes he didn't even see it coming until it was too late.  I didn't see any hand all the way through - but suddenly I was.  He should have questioned why, but the allure of making significantly more money this time around was too much for him to question it.

Trading is similar.  It's easy to rationalize ""but it will go back up again.""  Sure, it might.  Even if it does, how long will that take?  What if it doesn't?  Hanging on to a losing proposition is pure greed, and it will likely destroy everything you're working for.  

While most people were depressed about being in the red after the holiday dumps, I kept selling and buying lower.  Prices still aren't back up to the top, but I've got a lot more than I started with, and people that bought at ATH (during the same time period) and held do not.

The same can be said for profits as well.  Sure, you could potentially sell at a higher price by holding on as long as possible - *but* you could also end up holding right up until the correction.  Pick a **reasonable** point to sell at, and don't even concern yourself with it going higher.  You got the exact amount of profit you were looking for, so... mission accomplished, great job!  Generally I'll shoot for 10-25%, usually on the low end unless it's regularly fluctuating by 20%+.  Those larger fluctuations though... I typically only manage to catch a few before things start averaging out.  Still, once you have a decent amount built up, 5-10% could still end up being a decent amount, especially if you're doing that couple times a day, several days a week.

That's really the general answer.  I use a web browser and risk management.  No fancy sketches on my charts.  You *will* lose some money.  All that matters is that you minimize those losses (risk management).  If you're doing that, you're likely to be making more than you lose.

If you're wanting to give it a go, I'd say start off small, and stick to flipping that small amount.  Don't get discouraged with losses - just learn from it.  Use it as a teaching tool that reinforces your risk management, or what **you** are looking for in a currency.  Keep pushing that small amount until it gets big enough to pull some out - then invest that chunk in something long term or sell for fiat.  The best advice (that I got from someone else) that I can give for that learning process is don't leave anything in your day trades overnight!  While you sleep it can (and often does) tank, and you won't be there to apply your risk management rules - and that's the same as not having any.",1525477556

Majority of it is explained by the system being in complete infancy still. Simple as that.

Either you believe that will stop soon, or as it becomes harder to mine and more scarce it will shoot to ridiculous limits at some point. If B. happens don't expect the crypto market to realize any sort of overvalue anytime soon.

But that money from us won’t do much, what will make Crypto get past the 1 trill market cap is the newbies. Most their money will go through coinbase, then coinbase gets more money and advertise to the new people more and it snowballs as the big name that people think of when they think how to buy crypto. I’m not saying ethos won’t be successful I’m just saying it won’t be the king because people will always go to the easier one first then when they learn enough they may switch they may not.

"TL;DR 

LN roughs payments through channels, each channel has to have a balance available secured by a ""smart contract on L1"" this can be used to route other canal payments. LN is a network of routed channels. 

I think you are ignorant of the economic ramifications of LN, but hey I'm not here to test your understanding, and it seems you are not here to confirm I understand. 

In fact, 100% of Core developers agree fees wouldn't go up over $10 when committing to the Segwit and LN roadmap.  I don't think developers are good at economic predictions or understand how the network will evolve. I'm just predicting what will happen based on the mechanisms presented by the smartest guys in the room, the Core developers. You probably don't understand why Mastercard and other banks are funding LN development, but that's OK.  

Just attack insult discredit, not asking questions when you are out of your depth is how Core shills rolls., so that's OK.

I know how enough to understand the economic mechanism involved in how LN channels work to understand why they are not a scaling solution for Bitcoin. in 2015/ I was a proponent of the LN concept, but unlike you, I wasn't blinded by the economic reality you just overlooked. ",1525474849

 Acceptance will allow greater stability, yet if you're an American as myself, expect upcoming hyperinflation to allow Bitcoin to Moonshoot.

Creditors holding USD or fiat assets should be recompensated fiat value, just as with Mt. Gox. Since Bitgrail has no fiat processing, this is irrelevant. Then, any specific assets should be redistributed to customers that can be compensated in full. For example, BTC, ETH, and all cryptos not affected. Those creditors should not receive less because they need to pay off the debts of the Nano creditors.

Nano creditors should have their repayment amount equally split to avoid bias and unfairness, as you mentioned.

"&gt;IMO, the dinar people went out of their way to cause brand confusion

The very fact you accept that its not fraud if you just let people use a name until it becomes generic means you're abdicating any responsible for criminalizing what will otherwise be considered legal voluntary behavior. bringing down the coercive power of the state on competitors because you don't want them to genericize your brand name even though the principal legal defense against genericization of a brand name is successful registration and continued legal defense of a trademark, which you don't have and doesn't even work consistently anyway. A brand name you didn't create and who's creator never sought or indicated any desire to use government power to prevent forks using the name.

So people in coercive nation states around the world can all use the same name to describe different currencies without going to jail for fraud, but in your ancap 'let 1000 nations bloom' vision of the future only 1 currency can use 1 name even if its based off freely shared open license open source software and the inventor of the term and software never tried to claim the brand as a trademark or take any steps that would make it easier the word only to be associated with one currency?

What's next, is software piracy also a form of fraud in your ancap utopia? After all, you're violating all those laws you never agreed to that protect content producers from being defrauded of their rightful intellectual property.

&gt;You entered the trade voluntarily

Check your contract better then. In contract law you're only entitled to whats in the contract. As far as I know no one was ever signed a contract for BTC and got BCH and if they had they would have a trivial time suing. 

&gt;Bitcoin that has been stolen cannot be forced to be repaid; but there are plenty other methods that could be applied to remedy fraud.

"I didn't think that one was so bad. It only took to october the same year to begin the next rally, i.e. 6 months. The next 'crash'/downtrend lasted a lot longer \(dec 2013 \- oct 2015\).

Also, after the previous rally to $32 in 2011 and subsequent drop to $2\-something \(which also took much longer\), many thought there'd never be another opportunity like that and the 2013 was really good in that respect. It showed that bitcoin was here to stay and we'd probably have these rally's again and again. The crash was only because MtGox and other exchanges could not handle the insane increase in volume, that was certainly something that could and would be solved in time. No fundamental problem with bitcoin itself.

The sentiment now feels very similar to 2013 to me. There is no 'blood in the streets' at all, I'd say most feel the current/recent 'crash' was just a brief cool\-off period that was necessary after the insane rally and we are all ready for the next stage.",1525473763

"With a bit less story:  

1\) It has no fees.  If you send 1 nano back and forth a million times you will have at the end, 1 nano.  

2\) Transaction times are instant/incredibly low.  Other coins use a blockchain where every transaction is cared about by everyone so everyone has the entire state of the chain.  Nano has a block lattice which means each wallet has its own chain and you only need to care about yourself.  Then you do some ""PoW"" or ""Proof of work"" as the anti\-spam measure.  This can be precomputed after your last send \(or before your first\) but it takes about 3\-12 seconds to do.  If it's precomputed both parties will see and verify the transaction in about 1 second.  

3\) Great for environment.  There are no fees and there are no minable coins so that means no one setting up warehouses of servers/ASICs.  While this provides no incentive to people run nodes \(which vote on what transactions are valid\) it's a better scheme than mining due to the environmental benefit.  As I mentioned before, the PoW is light and any company doing lots of transactions can buy slightly beefier GPUs and reach the throughput of VISA/Mastecard \(1700 txn/sec\) all the while still only needing 1 server.  Bitcoin on the otherhand is sitting at nearly 176m KWh for yesterday for 3txn/sec.

However, coinbase is not the only actor and other brokers participated as well. 

Lastly, saying that people came in during the hype, and left because of how crippled it is, is largely inaccurate.

"I know the marketplace isn't zero sum, I wasn't being literal. I'm saying all those Xmas investors who lost half their money to market manipulators are upset and the ones who dropped out lower the already insane market cap.

I understand companies commit fraud and their stock loses money. But we have entire government branches set up to watch for fraud. Bitgrail lost $195 million dollars and nothing happened to them. I hope you're not saying crypto is less risky than traditional investment vehicles.

Calling me new doesn't explain why you think my argument is wrong. Most people aren't Elon musk, who keeps working despite the fact him and 10 generations of his family could live like Kings on his current net worth. 

And my original argument is that crypto isn't used as a currency, it's an investment instrument. If they were to turn off Fiat exchanges today for Bitcoin, eth, etc, do you really think anybody would accept them for goods or services? Crypto is nothing without government backed securities, and probably never will be. Their value is in moving things around, anonymously, quickly, but that's more of a product than a currency.

btw. CSW's ""Fallacy of Selfish Mining in Bitcoin"" paper may or may not be BS, so what? You know what noise is? It's Emin ""correct"" maths in his 2013 paper, where he publicly predicted the demise of bitcoin because he found the week link in the security.  You know why no one has been selfish mining? It's because Selfish Mining is a fallacy, Emin may have good math but he has bad assumptions it's not profitable to do Selfish Mining, if it were I'd be doing it, and if not me someone else.

I'd say watch some YouTube videos on how to use the wallets of your various coins. Read about public-private key cryptography, or at least in how it pertains to cryptocurrencies. Read about how block chains work and why storing your private key safely is important. 

Each of these coins works differently, with different wallets and exported key formats. So the storage methods will vary between them. For instance, I store crypto keys on the Ledger Nano S, Trezor, encrypted flash drive, and on paper, depending on what it is and how long I plan on holding it.

The occult (from the Latin word occultus ""clandestine, hidden, secret"") is ""knowledge of the hidden"". In common English usage, occult refers to ""knowledge of the paranormal"", as opposed to ""knowledge of the measurable"", usually referred to as science. The term is sometimes taken to mean knowledge that ""is meant only for certain people"" or that ""must be kept hidden"", but for most practicing occultists it is simply the study of a deeper spiritual reality that extends beyond pure reason and the physical sciences. The terms esoteric and arcane can also be used to describe the occult, in addition to their meanings unrelated to the supernatural.

"So, Nano is a currency coin. It shouldn't be compared to ETH at all imo.
ETH is beautiful in it's own way i.e. to be a smart contract platform, build decentralized apps, raise funds, etc. and undoubtedly the best in that category at least till now. There's a reason it has such a huge amount of people developing on it.

But, let's compare Nano to BTC/LTC/XRP and other non-privacy focused currency coins. For that purpose, simply ask yourself one question, when you pay cash to a friend for splitting a bill, do you pay any transaction fees? Does your cash take hours to reach your friend? I assume no! Similarly, Nano enable you to do the same over the internet! No fees, and instant!

I respect Bitcoin a lot for it is the sole reason this entire industry was born. But people must realize that Bitcoin was the first experiment of a kind not at all built with a focus on worldwide adoption. Due to this, it's not scalable as much as other currencies like Nano which were designed to do so from the beginning! [I know some will argue that Lightning Network (LN) will change this, but no matter what, it's inconvenient. It's like having a physically ugly wife, but to make her look pretty to the world, you get her some plastic surgery :)]  Anyway, Nano is the only cryptocurrency which is truly feeless, instant, green, efficient, and fairly distributed without any ICOs or gimmicks. Again, people will argue that XRP/XLM are almost free, but there's always an ""almost"".
And to be fair, Nano does have it's problems with exchanges too, but you must realize that it's not really a blockchain like most other currencies. It's a totally new tech which bring in tons of unprecedented issues for exchanges. But I'm sure this will improve with time with more practice and adoption by exchanges. Lastly, Nano has an extremely modest, transparent, hard working and intelligent dev team behind it. Here, I wouldn't discredit the teams of other cryptos but Nano devs are really good too!

bitcoin succeeded in that. The fact that people store their money in bitcoin means that they assume the expected earnings to be better than traditional stores of value.

"&gt;In your specific example, where channel states are not broadcast

It's not my specific example, that's precisely how Lightning works today.

&gt;no network map is maintained

I never said that. Nodes maintain a graph of nodes (vertices) and channels (edges) along with the *capacity* (total amount committed to the channel) and the fee for routing each direction. They use this information to calculate a number of *potential* routes, then attempt payment through them. If a payment fails, they likely know at which point in the route it failed and can cull any other potential routes that use that node/channel.

&gt;For example, let's say you want to send me .01 BTC. I say great, please send me on LN - I have a channel open with someone with that capacity.

You'd have to generate an invoice, which contains a preimage hash and your node's pubkey. When I feed this invoice into my node, it looks in the channel graph for channels owned by your pubkey and work backwards from there via the process I described above.

&gt;I'm obviously not going to tell you all the channels I have open with that capacity for privacy reasons

All public channels are currently tied to a static identifier for your node, the pubkey. So given your pubkey I can find all of the *public* channels you have open, their capacity (though not how much you own in each), and the fees charged for routing through the channel. Any non-publicly announced channels are not discoverable through these means, but if you want me to pay you through one, there's a field in the invoice for ""route hints"" - private channels not otherwise advertised. With that information I can include those private channels in my generated route.",1525468767

Since a client from 2 years ago, before BCH existed, still works on Bitcoin, that means Bitcoin is closer to Bitcoin than BCH is.

Accepted everywhere? Well it's a simple fact that Bitcoin is accepted more than ANY altcoin, not just Bitcoin Cash. Of all the places that accept Altcoins though, Bitcoin Cash is the most widely accepted Altcoin.

Bitcoin Cash is just Bitcoin with larger blocksizes. Not ""Without a limit"". 

Although since Bitcoin Cash specifically was designed and branded to be a ripoff, with the same orange logo and everything, etc. Since it's name, it was misleading, and became a scam when the entire group that forked, launched, and marketed it, all decided to pretend it's something it's not.

If I make a new soda called ""Coca Cola Soda"" instead of ""Coca Cola"", but I copied the design, colors, and then marketed it as ""Coca Cola, the REAL one!"", you bet your ass it would be a scam. Even if the soda tastes the same. The new Soda is not a scam, it's a real drink, with a different name, but if I marketed it as ""A cheaper alternative to the official"", it's not a scam, but if I market it as ""Coca Cola"" on purpose, that brand is now a scam.

It's not that you, Bob, or a community made it a scam, it's that the group of developers and literally copied/pasted (And still continues) the code from Bitcoin Core source code (BCH gets updates about a day after, with the same code changes, because Bitcoin ABC literally just copies the code line for line, and you can compare Bitcoin Core to Bitcoin ABC client)

So yeah, no.",1525468405
"I think it depends on where the adoption is coming from, full adoption should be viewed as the moon.  

When a bunch of speculating billionaires jump in we'll see a huge spike but it wouldnt be sustainable until adoption catches up.  This would be the same as the money in the stock market trading hands with other speculators.  The billionaire investors wont be taking everyone to the moon, just a few lambos for a misguided people.

"&gt; That's true it isn't. Everyone knows this.

True, yes, but the claim that BCH is an ""altcoin"" or ""started less than a year ago"" is false.  Bitcoin forked.  Both forks have the history of Bitcoin, the legacy of Bitcoin, and their own reasons for forking.  BTC was more popular for a large number of reasons, and likely not the ones you might think.  BCH isn't ""Bitcoin"" but it also isn't ""unrelated to Bitcoin"" or ""never had any claim to the name Bitcoin"".

Regardless, my point was that rBitcoin is, in fact, using their subreddit as a megaphone to broadcast exactly what they want, contrary to what you implied.  They have also used their subreddit to manipulate the direction that BTC has taken since 2015.  This has and will cause financial damage to those who have been mislead by them and hold only Bitcoins without understanding that Bitcoin is being intentionally crippled for reasons they aren't allowed to read or discuss.",1525468092

Bcash is a nice name, quicker than Bitcoin cash, and helps avoid any confusing it with the real Bitcoin (which is why of course Ver hates the name). I'll always call it bcash myself, though it won't be as relevant to talk about in the future

"Bitcoin was suppossed to be used so that people can send money back and forth to each other.  I think thats what the author is suggesting.  That being said, Satoshi was a visionary, and at the time of inception, his vision was revolutionary.  But as time passed the need to be able transfer money back and forth was filled by other cryptocurrencies.  

Is Bitcoin exactly what it was at its inception, and the years after?  No.  Is it revolutionary?  Is it important?  Has it changed the world for the better?  Has it paved the way for a new way for people to transact peer to peer without middlemen or governments to tell them how they can do it?  I think you can answer that.  To say that bitcoins vision has become perverted is a disservice to the vision of its creator in my opinion.  More than anything I think Satoshi wanted to change the way that people saw money, and he achieved that on a grand scale.  And if he is still here I think he would be proud of what bitcoin has become.",1525468031

"Love the honesty, crypto is just a gamble and it will all come crashing down later. No tokens guarantee rights to the tech that will be used later. Everyone is throwing money into a psyop that WILL crash will bringing down a ton of mainstream garbage in its wake. 

DLT and a ""Blockchain"" of sorts will have a lot of value in the future. This tech is still in Alpha imo, 5 years down the road it will be pretty good. But the use case is the biggest IF here. Intelligence Agencies created this garbage, they will get out and finish it later. Certain technology/concepts will remain, but it's going to be a looooooooong ride. 

Crypto/Blockchain is a massive distraction anyway. Yes, the technology could do wonders, but we haven't even estbalished top level order. It basically requires a higher level world government ""cough cough UN"" of sorts to govern it. Sorry not gonna happen without some Nuremberg trials. ",1525466806

"So in theory, I could turn every single coin into a scam if I wanted, just by saying that? Rogers being highly unethical in presenting BCH as ""Bitcoin"" on his websites, that crosses a line I agree. But saying it is closer to the original Bitcoin Blockchain is a claim he is entitled to make, saying BTC forked away is also a claim he can fairly make, ""scales better and is accepted everywhere"" are just debatable points, him saying those don't automatically turn it into a scam.         
The potential scam is one individual, RVer, tricking people into buying a coin he owns to boost the value of his holdings. The coin itself though, is just a version of Bitcoin with no blocksize limit. It is not a scam.

There is no long process.  It has not begun, it has not been defined, there is no way to tell when Core would determine that a blocksize discussion would finally be allowed without censorship and/or necessary or relevant.

"ye these TA people who bring out 10 updates every day are not useful for you if you want to scalp on technicalities. On an 5 minute chart. You have to learn to do it yourself because you hang behind on every trade anyway. and if you in a trade something happens and no updates comes fast? Lets just panicsell because I don't know what to do... 

Tradingview is quite nice to evaluate people because you can't delete ideas once they are published. So you can check out the complete history and get a picture of what content they produce and how often the calls are close/right.  \(They could ofc create a new account after a while but ye if someone has only a 1\-2 month history then you should be aware of that.\) Noone is 100&amp;#37; right TA is not seeing the future. and there are points which are hard to call and other points where you can call a move with 80&amp;#37; certainty. 

You have a high probability to see a trend reversal when btc came down to 15k because we created a lower low with a strong high volume move. At that point you had a high chance that BTC goes down further. There are never guarantees so sometimes you will have the situation where you have to reenter with \~10&amp;#37; missed gains. That is risk management.

The silent majority doesn't know - and often may not care - that the censorship in [rBitcoin has literally shaped Bitcoin's future.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/78p28p/where_did_rBitcoin_go).

This is a big problem.  Or rather, it was a big problem for Bitcoin.  At this point, the damage has been done, it's just a matter of how long it will take CryptoCurrencies as a whole to move past this damage(and move past Bitcoin).",1525466080
"I honestly don't know if this conversation is worth my time... I suppose the only part that even remotely interests me is explaining how ""assumedvalid"" has no trust...

So, here goes:

""assumedvalid"" works by validating everything BUT the signatures within a transaction.  It still validates that the difficulty is still being updated and that the block hashes satisfy the difficulty, and that transactions are spending the appropriate amount, and that the merkle tree validates within each block, and whatever else I'm not listing.

So, that being said, the only thing NOT being validated is the ECDSA signature validation.  It assumes all provided signatures are okay when being invoked within OP_CHECKSIG/VERIFY.

Assume we're at block 170--the very first actual transaction.  Let's assume we're a new node who received a block where that transaction signature doesn't actually verify (but we're not validating signatures, so we don't know).  In order for that to be a valid block (assuming the obvious case that someone hasn't finished quantum computing and created a sha256 collision--in which bitcoin is fucked anyway), the transaction hash must be different, and therefore the block hash must be different.  This new block hash must first meet the new difficulty requirement, and furthermore, every block after that must be redone since ITS block hash must be different to accommodate the change in block#170's new hash.  In order for me to accept this chain, literal years of (proof of) work have to be done in order to falsify this block so that finally I receive a block with a timestamp even close to what I know to be the current timestamp.  Since this is obviously not possible, it is safe to assume that signature indeed validates the transaction.  If the attacker failed to do this work, the block hashes would either not verify, the difficulty would not verify, or the attacker would stop producing blocks, and then the *actually* correct chain would have a higher height, making the invalid/falsified fork irrelevant.

Does this make sense?  Basically, since every other check is still being done, it's literally impossible for that signature to not verify--unless the entire bitcoin community (for years , and years...) have conspired to make that a valid transaction (which effectively just implements a very off consensus rule) when it wasn't.

I think the only think you're not thinking of is understanding that the rest of the checks are still being done (PoW, Difficulty Adjustments, etc)...",1525466065

"Dear Crypto Panda, this is a response to your erroneous and misleading post about Lympo.
There are major factual errors in your Medium article. First of all, we did not collect $17 million in our ICO, instead a total sum of $14 million was raised. You shouldn’t trust the first source found on Google.
Secondly, regarding the ad with Caroline Wozniacki. We understand that you might have misheard Caroline saying “I use Lympo” instead of “I would use Lympo,” but it’s a shame that you didn’t double check it. You can hear it clearly here: https://youtu.be/zLCivsUTH58?t=44
There are plenty of articles on Caroline’s engagement with Lympo saying that the app will be released later this year. It is also clearly indicated on Lympo.io, Lympo.com and in all of our communications, we are completely transparent about it. 
Thinking that a world-class star would risk her reputation saying something as false as this is rather incredible. These kinds of deals are discussed with multiple people representing the athlete, including written communication on every single word that Caroline would say. We are disappointed with this demonstration of complete ignorance about Lympo and bold accusations regarding our ambassador.
To continue, yes, you are right – there will always be cheaters, be it fitness, taxes, gaming or any other area. Despite this, technology is constantly evolving due to innovative solutions and every day it is getting harder to cheat on all kinds of systems and platforms. With the right measures taken it inevitably comes to a point when cheating simply becomes too much of a hassle. 
We are already actively discussing with gear engineers about preventing all kinds of cheating. There are many measures and standards for that and for now we will be able to reduce it with programmed calculations, taking into account various factors which will serve to evaluate the validity of submitted data.
In the future, we will certainly implement an AI-based data analyzer which will be able to evaluate data to an even greater degree of accuracy. Large amounts of raw data with multiple parameters will help to continuously train the AI and ensure the ever increasing accuracy of analysis results.
Furthermore, token rewards will be small enough not to create an incentive to put actual effort into gaming the system – it just won’t be worth it, and so cheaters will not compromise our ecosystem.
In fact, the challenges too will be designed to minimize this risk:
1. Challenges posted by a users’ personal trainer after they paid in LYM tokens will work as a cash back option. One may cheat on those, sure, but generally, this group of people is interested in getting fit rather than struggling to find a way to cheat an app.
2. Challenges by sports events where you have to provide, for example, your marathon ticket number. This group of users is genuinely interested in running. They will pay a participation fee in advance and later use Lympo as a cash back system. We believe that this too will help minimize cheating, together with other measures.
Going further, we agree that there was a miscommunication regarding purchases of LYM directly with USD. There are no direct pairings like LYM/USD, LYM/EUR or LYM for any fiat. You are right; this was a communication error from our side. We would also like to add that we are, in fact, currently working with several exchanges to launch LYM/Fiat pairs.
Although we appreciate your efforts to write a comprehensive critique, in this case your position on Lympo is simply mistaken, and your tone is unconstructive and accusatory. In the future, we will only engage in constructive discussions since it takes too much of our time to respond to every single baseless accusation.

"**Bitcoin Sets Sights Above $10K After Bull Breakout**

https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-sets-sights-10k-bull-breakout/

Following a bull breakout last night, bitcoin (BTC) looks set to test $10,000 and could possibly move higher over the weekend.

Bitcoin closed yesterday (as per UTC) at $9,759 on Bitfinex - the highest daily close since March 7 - signaling the upside break of the week-long narrowing price range we've been anticipating.

The cryptocurrency also clocked a two-month high of $9,875 yesterday. At time of writing, BTC is changing hands at $9,776 and remains on the hunt for a big break above the $10,000 mark, as indicated by the bullish setup in the technical charts below.

View

BTC looks set to test the 200-day MA resistance of $10,015. A close (as per UTC) above that level would strengthen the bull grip and could yield a sustained rally to $10,455 and above.

The outlook remains bullish as long as prices hold above the ascending 10-day MA, located at $9,290.

An unexpected close (as per UTC) below $8,652 (April 26 low, pennant low) would signal a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change.",1525462759

It's true that a more valuable network is likely to show more accumulated difficulty, but that's an *effect*, not a cause. It would make exactly as much sense to just look at the price and decide based on that--which is arguably how exchanges and other blockchain businesses make these decisions in actual practice.

So how is ""user/market consensus"" achieved in the first place? As I've already pointed, it emerges from public discourse, institutional inertia, and various other forces that work to shape and sway popular opinion.

That answer doesn't sit well with a lot of people in this community, because we'd all prefer to believe that everything about Bitcoin is apolitical, self-regulated, and governed by immutable rules, but I think it's important to be honest about this.

"There are a lot of assumptions, especially in the second half.

&gt; Just admit to yourselves that if you made $20 million USD from a $1000 investment, you cash that shit out and live a life of luxury without ever thinking of Bitcoin ever again.

Not invested in Bitcoin at the moment, but if my investments take off you're absolutely right.  I would cash some out to secure my life - but only enough to live comfortably for a while without any worries.  I would trade some more to invest in other projects that I think would do well (both financially and from a technology standpoint).  Another section would be moved to increase how much I could day trade with, and then everything else would remain where it is.

&gt; If anybody really cared about ""the tech"" you'd invest in companies trying to implement the block chain rather than buying coins and hoping they gain enough speculation to warrant a profit on the trading of said coin. 

It doesn't have to be mutually exclusive.  Right now I'm primarily day trading, yes because of profit.  I'm not happy with the amount I can throw to projects I believe in, so I trade so that I can increase those positions... mostly in projects that are in an ICO stage to fund the development of the technology.  Given I'm seeing actual development progress, I'd say that the funds they've received from their ""coins"" is exactly what you claim it isn't - an investment in the company responsible for implementation.

&gt; In order for somebody to gain money, somebody else has to lose. Everybody on these crypto subs keeps treating crypto ""currency"" as a security to be traded for profit after increasing in Fiat value. All those people who bought Bitcoin above 10k are still losers that fueled the coke binge of a few whales on top.

This too is all about perspective.  You're right, if you are looking short term then someone who bought above $10k lost money to someone else.  However, if/when the price rises beyond the point that person bought in at, then they're no longer in a position where you can say they've lost their money to someone else.  You're also making the assumption that people are *only* going for long term investments.

"I would argue that the existence of thousands of coins would render all of them too volatile to function as a global form of money, as opposed to one or maybe a small handful of truly global currencies. 

I find myself agreeing with the idea that humanity can probably only support one primary form of PoW simply due to the staggering efficiency that can be achieved by having one blockchain and one global source of truth. Certainly there will be endless projects and attempts to change the status quo, but if there is already a blockchain which is universally supported the status quo will tend to remain.

I have every confidence PoS will solve real problems involved with current forms of shareholding and corporate voting. There are plenty of circumstances where having an open system with a centralized (but transparent) emission structure would make owning corporate shares, and voting with those shares, incredibly more efficient and effective. I do not, however, believe that PoS has any use as a form of decentralized consensus as **participation in a PoS system always requires you to buy stake from someone else** making all participation *permissioned* by the availability of purchasable shares, whereas with PoW you do not need to have any internal stake to begin earning coins and participating in the network.

"What stage of Cryptocurrency adoption are we in?


Innovators (2.5%) - I think this was between 2009 - spring of 2017


Early Adopters (13.5%)  - summer 2017 to present.   I think we are still in this stage.  Do you agree?


Early Majority (34%) - maybe begins when price breaks 75k.  Early adopters finally got their family members to invest.  To the moon!!! 


Late Majority (34%) - price breaks 300k. People start to use it regularly as currency. 


Laggards (16%) - price breaks 1 million. Almost everyone knows about bitcoin and many are actively using it.

"&gt;32MB blocks are 100% doable today

They are [not](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8fbgb5/why_does_8mb_supposedly_lead_to_centralisation/dy2kju0/).

&gt;UTXO bloat

If there is no incentive to restrain the UTXO set, it will continue to grow indefinitely. This is real, and was the case with Coinbase (if you ever wonder why they were supporting bigger blocks... so they didn't have to spend money to collect all the dust UTXOs!). Left unchecked, the UTXO set would simply continue to grow, and since it lives in the memory, not on the HDD, it can easily bloat out or proportion causing nodes to break down because they cannot handle the load. Thus more RAM is required to run a node, so fewer can run a node... centralization pressure.

&gt;Bandwidth cost

Sure, you can run a non-validating node at home... but that's by definition a *trusted* setup - You are trusting other to feed you correct data, and you cannot do anything about it. If you reduce yourself to a ""zombie ATM consumer"", why bother with cryptos to begin with?

Also, a server in a data centre is quintessential centralization? Say AWS receives a court order to shut down all full nodes... do you think they will hesitate an instant? Poof, your fully validating hosted node is no more. (Think it was just last week that AWS had to censor some specific type of software or content... can't remember exactly what it was.)

And if you leave full nodes to miners only... see my comment about being a ""zombie ATM consumer"" above.

&gt;IBD

No, the problem is not solved. Yes, the argument makes sense, but it is also irrelevant.

Bootstrapping the blockchain (IBD) **cannot be skipped** as this is the only way to obtain a fully valid UTXO set in a **trustless** way. The key part of this is in your own response... you talk about ""*assumedvalid*"" blocks, which are by definition... ASSUMED! Does not make it so. In addition, you'd also need the UTXO set valid for *assumedvalid* block, to build your subsequent validation upon. What if I feed you a fake *assumedvalid* block, with corresponding fake UTXO set? You will never sync. Or even worse, what if I completely contaminate the ecosystem by setting up hundreds of *assumedvalid* blocks and corresponding UTXO sets? (Basically a Sybil attack...) How are you going to determine which is the actually correct one? You have to get to a **trusted** setup, where some peers are designated as *trusted parties*. Well, but if we need trusted parties, we have banks already so why bother with cryptos?

Also see my post above why big blocks quickly become unsustainable.. IBD is one of the key reasons. Cutting corners on the **completely trustless** setup? Sure, than big blocks can work.

&gt;Storage

We should really stop talking about storage, it was never about storage and Roger is intentionally agitating a non-issue to distract from the real problems, like /u/bitusher points out.

So the article says that by that time the security of Bitcoin will be largely reduced.

Their government has shown time and again they'll back Chinese businesses and projects instead of foreign ones so if they're successful in getting it to work I've little doubt it'll be a huge success.

This was changed and I am grateful, but setting aside the bitcoin.com website. You don't need to go far to see is 'carefree' / 'irresponsible' behaviour, you can see the reply comments to mine. People think that their saying of bitcoin cash being 'the real bitcoin' or how 'bitcoin core' is not bitcoin anymore is justified when it is not. Not only the bitcoin.com website misleads people who are just starting to inform themselves into mixing information between what is going on with BTC and BCH. Stating the obvious /r/btc is a bigger bch community than /r/bch  

Bitcoin Cash was a proposal that failed and that is why the hard fork resulted into it being a separate coin. I is because the minority who wanted to use the new proposal decided that it was valuable enough (which I also agree, bch has its merits). It is still a minority tho, I am not saying that it is an insignificant minority, totally the contrary it is a significant minority. And you can see that in the amount of transactions daily of both chains, BCH has almost 10% the amount of transactions that BTC has.

"&gt; BCH is upgrading to 32M blocks on 15th of May. https://news.bitcoin.com/upgrade-time-bitcoin-cash-plans-a-32-mb-hard-fork/

I know, I was talking about *actually* filling those blocks, with for example 50% test tx and operating a corresponding amount of SPV wallets. Its easy to increase blocksize and say your network now supports X users. This is obiously not necessarily the case, because if you remove the blocksize entirely you could support infinite users (with that reasoning). Fill them blocks and lets see what happens.

&gt; The calculations have been done

Some of them have, for example this one: https://www.coindesk.com/spv-support-billion-bitcoin-users-sizing-scaling-claim/

&gt; UTXO commitments aren't ready yet - but I don't think there is any major disagreement that they would make IBD much faster, and I don't think there is any unsolved issues with doing it - I think there just isn't motivation to do them yet with everything else going on.

What I don't get is that this seems easy to implement, yet this has not even been done before you increase blocksize - I mean, you don't even need larger blocksize.

&gt;  It will be interesting to see how it all plays out over the next few years for sure.

Well... not really tbh.. We already have ethereum for example thats actually filling blocks - and litecoin which has had larger blocks than bitcoin for many many years now... so theres nothing new on the table really.

&gt; What I don't think the proponents of that strategy realise, or take seriously, is that there are competing systems - if they play it too safe they are risking the whole project - it will becoming obsolete. To me that is a bigger risk than increasing the block size.

More stuff is happening for bitcoin than any other project. I see actual work done on bitcoin to actually fix the problems it has compared to other cryptos who just kick the can down the road. Its easy to increase blocksize. You can always do that. What you can't do is suddenly build a decentralize base layer and add 2nd layer solutions on top when the shit hits the fan.",1525456808

The ultimate point is staying silent means we condone the behavior.  The debate isnt going to be won or addressed by ignoring it.  Especially given the fact it directly impacts the Bitcoin brand.  The debate isnt the thing keeping the claim alive, the fact they are misrepresenting Bitcoin using consumer facing Bitcoin branded channels is what keeps it alive.

TX speed can be better however cost is definitely not. On a platform the cost to operate the network (support nodes) is distributed between all of the tokens launched on the network. On an independent application specific chain the cost to operate the network is much higher because a single application must drive all of financial support for it. It's a relatively simple concept. Also Important to note is Devery does not require high transactions speeds. Independent blockchains are mostly forks of BTC or ETH anyways (and a few others that feature faster TX times for consensus) So its basically a meme to go independent unless your soul purpose is to develop a better blockchain foundation to build on like Bytom or EOS.  ,1525456544

As a European, this seems pretty logic.

So most people have only a mortgage, any credit history except eventually a car loan would negatively impact the rate at which you'll get a mortgage.

Well, BTC is very volatile - but the volatility trends upwards - so that's not a worry :)

Regarding means of exchange: 

Consider this: if you have 10k's worth of gold under your bed, and wish to sell it - at the current 'market price' - How do you do that?  Think about it.  Where do you take it to sell it?  You can't.  (Except maybe a Cash for Gold type place, where you will lose 30% of its value.)

So because it's a matter of national pride and interest they would buy ICX up and pump it so it's more expensive than bitcoin. I heard this in early January and for a while it looked like the OP might have merit because I remember reading it and watching ICON pump to like 11 or 12 bucks.

"&gt; nChain is (attempting to) build a patent wall around what they define BCH to be.

Correction, they can't define my BCH (no one person can define BCH it's defined by the market), nChain can define how the licensees of their patents use their IP. That's between nChain and the licensees - the people who build products on top of BCH, not BCH 

&gt;Once they get other companies to start using their patents, then in the event of any future fork they get to decide to which fork the patent license applies.

This is a valid concern, but it's not as big as you think I have a solution for you. It's related to BUIP087 https://bitco.in/forum/threads/buip087-utilization-of-%E2%80%9Ccash%E2%80%9D-denomination.10202/

It's a BU vote to get an ISO currency code for Bitcoin Cash bits or = 0.000001 BCH - they will be called XCH or cash.

1XBT = 1BTC 

1BCH = 1,000,000 XCH 

So when this goes into global currency trading terminals people are going to be using XCH like the use XBT. only it's going to be hole numbers as opposed to fractions. 

so when you buy a coffee it will be 299 XCH as opposed to 0.000299 BCH

**how is this important?**

remember the F***up S2X, well no one could agree which fork would be they BTC chain, so they called it off. 

Well if Bitcoin Cash ETF's, Hedge funds, Exchanges, merchants, all adopt XCH as the currency code we can put a little advisory definition in there as to how the chain that gets the XCH ticker defined. 

If you want you can discuss on there https://bitco.in/forum/threads/buip087-utilization-of-%E2%80%9Ccash%E2%80%9D-denomination.10202/ (i had some comments here too https://bitco.in/forum/threads/announcing-the-next-bu-vote-7th-may-2018.10656/#post-63337) 

it is not as easy as you may think, the result is also true for nChain, if we can't define BCH they can't either, without a definition who is left to rule on which is the BCH chain - the market?  

&gt;The idea of ""layer 1"" being open and free is a myth. They are trying to use patents to own the definition of ""layer 1""

As long as you don't put patents in layer 1 it is free. You and I have to not let patents go into layer 1. 

As for defining BCH we have to do it better than nChain (nChain can only define it within the use of there patents - we don't need to use their patents) we can push our definition as the dealt. 

Kicking and screaming does nothing, BCH is built on permissionless innovation, nCahin can do whatever they want with it, so can we.  We have to go do things or someone, so do it. Complaining is not doing anything, and if you are going to complain, complain about something that is more than just FUD.  ",1525454194

"I never said other coins won’t eventually come into this space. I’m saying it won’t happen now or any time soon. Even with Coinbase adding ERC20 support, their OTC pools will be primarily the top 1-3 coins. This will happen.

Assuming this happens before the bull run, the run will happen and then Money will flow more into alt coins. Over time, newer contenders will prove themselves (like ETH) and others will fade away. 

These alt coins everyone thinks will magically rocket us out of bear markets are speculative unproven dog shit until proven otherwise and only exasperate the bubble theory. Regardless, Money will flow into the top few coins first and at a massive volume. If they aren’t scalable this time around, the market won’t trust this space just like what happened in December.

&gt;If you deem fiat currencies to be controlled by banks &amp; government don't you think having your bitcoins on Coinbase wallet make them controlled by Coinbase

Coinbase is a private company that has limited/no control over Bitcoin. They provide money transfer services.

The US government has complete control over USD, the amount printed, the distribution, the future, the rules.

Nope, but as long as you use coinbase as a money transfer company, this isnt a big deal. Losing 500 dollars in a coinbase hack wont make me cry. Losing 500,000 dollars because government hyperinflation will.

"Lets take the company Wirex for example. You sign up for a Wirex account and purchase a Wirex card. You then send your bitcoins to the Wirex wallet. However this wallet is controlled by the Wirex company. You now have fallen into the ""not your keys not your bitcoin"" category. Wirex owns those keys not you; Wirex has given you a receipt saying ""You have this much bitcoin"". At any time, they can close up and not give you your money back.  
Lets switch gears to actually using the Wirex card. You go to a grocery store and swipe your Wirex card at the register. You have told Wirex to convert bitcoin into paper money and send it to the grocery store.  
The process is broken down into a few steps. You tell Wirex to send money to VISA, VISA then sends the money to the grocery store's bank, the grocery store's bank then sends the money to the grocery store (hopefully).  
Every time that money needs to exchange hands, those banks take a little cut. Wirex takes a cut of money when they convert bitcoin to paper money and send it to VISA. VISA takes a cut of that money and sends it to the grocery store's bank. The grocery store's bank takes a cut of that money before they send it to the grocery store's account. This is the crux of using a bitcoin credit card.  
However with bitcoin alone, you can just send money directly from your wallet to the grocery store's bitcoin wallet.  
I recommend storing your large sum of bitcoin in a hardware wallet and storing that in a safe place. Then get a mobile wallet and load enough money into the wallet that you are willing to spend on a day to day basis.  
Let's create an analogy.  
Currently, my real physical wallet contains 60 USD (paper cash) and my debit card.  
The 60 USD represents the money that can be stolen from me if I was physically robbed at gunpoint. This is similar to how a mobile wallet can be stolen from. You would only want to store a small amount of spending money on your mobile wallet.  
Next, the debit card's checking account refers to my hardware wallet. I store a large sum of money in my debit card's checking account. I don't walk around with that large sum of money in cash, on my person, on a day to day basis. I need to store that money in the bank, however with bitcoin, I want to store it in my hardware wallet.  
  
Overall, the process of using a Wirex card or a bitcoin debit card is a a way for institutions to create middle men and restrict your economic freedom.  If you have any questions please let me or r/bitcoin know.

"Sold most of my alts for bitcoin yesterday. So far a great decision. I feel at peace for the first time in a while. If BTC tanks, alts will tank harder and I can buy back lower and increase my stack. If BTC moons, awesome. If the alts start mooning again, oh well. I've made enough profit to be happy, and I've already more than doubled my BTC holding by playing the alt game. ",1525452401
"I like it, but I think ONT is pretty overvalued right now. I think it's good, just... I don't know how much more it can rise with no product (caugh EOS caugh, I know).

If you want a real moonshot, take a look at TKY and AMB as lower marketcap coins that could explode. AMB's team is insane. I know a lot of people say that, but seriously.

Other than that, we're flirting with 10k, and I think once we do, the general public starting coming in. Hailey Hairdresser and Bobby Busdriver are going to do ""Coinbase - Buy BTC"", and after a few weeks they may buy ETH or maybe LTC/BCH (barf). They won't be buying alts.

So I think the question is, how much tether money is waiting to get back in? If a lot, then I think alts are good. But right now, I think you really want to start getting into the core coins a little heavier than normal.

I'm personally going heavier in ETH than BTC, just because I think it's still insanely undervalued from the EOS selling, and overall ICO selling (ICOs funded in ETH, and exitscamming by 'paying salaries and development"" by selling off raised ETH.

So I think ETH has some insane months ahead of it.

VEN obviously is showing itself to be a beast, so I think it has a great excuse to occupy some space in the portfolio, especially with main net 1-2 months away.

WAN is hit or miss, I still can't tell if it's going to be the biggest thing since sliced bread or if it's just overhyped air. And if anyone thinks otherwise they need to double check how much kool-aid they drank, because there's really no tangible reason to hang a hat on why it's so ""hyped"" other than the fact that it sold out so fast and twitter crypto personalities call it the most hyped coin. That one is a total crapshoot on which way it goes.

"&gt;&gt; bitcoin.com ... soils Bitcoin's reputation

&gt; That's your viewpoint and that's fine.

Thanks for respecting my views!

&gt; For many in the BCH community, we see it quite differently. ... Bitcoin.com promoting this idea that BCH is the proper bitcoin is doing the right thing

I see no fault in having and expressing this opinion, no matter how I see it myself. The problem I see lies not in bitcoin.com promoting this idea (though I don't like it). The problem I see lies in the intentional confusion of new Bitcoin users.

Bitcoin.com was advertising with google to buy Bitcoin like this:

    Buy Now | bitcoin.com
    Buy Bitcoin, create Bitcoin Wallet, Read Bitcoin News and more, at: bitcoin.com
    How to Buy Bitcoin Quickly - What is Bitcoin? - Bitcoin.com - What is Bitcoin Cash?

Clicking on this lead to a sales screen prompting for:

    Buy Bitcoin Cash with Credit Card
    Buy Bitcoin Core with Credit Card

New Bitcoin users had no chance to understand, which of the offers is BTC and which is BCH. In my eyes bitcoin.com would have to make a disclaimer explaining the differences.

Btw, the protests about this deceitful behavior seem to have made at least a tiny impression on bitcoin.com and lead to a slightly modified landing page; though not much better in my eyes. The same landing page at buy.bitcoin.com now shows:

    Buy Bitcoin Cash (BCH) with Credit Card &gt;

When Bitcoin Cash can start marketing on the merits of their project instead of trying to steal the Bitcoin brand, then we can condone their presence in the space.  Until then they are a threat to the entire crypto community because they purposely and willfully lie and misrepresent both Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin and that is simply untenable.

Blockstream chose to to make the bitcoin scaling dependent on there patents. nChain has chosen to make there patents 100% optional by building them on top of BCH, BCH is not dependent on nChain for anything.  

I appreciate your skepticism and we all need to stay vigilant, the issue here is to avoid introducing any IP dependencies into layer 1. Layer 1 must stay open and free. BCH is that, BTC has lost that fight. nChain is not hooking IP into layer 1 but innovating on layer 2, 3 and 4. ",1525451149

Here is the direct link for Kira Nobles Campaign if you want to donate through that instead https://www.justgiving.com/campaigns/charity/solvingkidscancer/kiranoble

For crypto the shares outstanding can't be calculated because they don't fall under the same regulation. A real company is not allowed to dump shares, they have to announce what they're going to sell long in advance. A crypto company can just dump all the coins they want on the market, then create as many coins as they want out of thin air and do it again.  
Exchanges have no way of tracking who owns what coins so their only option is to calculate the full market cap.

Technically, it is first validated and then it can still be rejected by other nodes.

&gt;Whatever the truth is about Satoshi he was no diety. 

Referring to his ideas can hardly be compared with deifying him. It was his ideas after all. He designed Bitcoin it in a particular way, for particular reasons.

&gt;Satoshi obviously didn't see the block size debate

In fact, the Satoshi that we knew would have never even considered restricting blocksize below market demand. It was only a prevention mechanism against a particular attack.

&gt;Satoshi didn't anticipate mining pools either.

He in fact very clearly anticipated nodes to become professionally run in server halls and that ordinary users would not be running them. If anything, he didn't expect such small miners to join pools in the way they did.

&gt;For all you typed you failed to say whether or not it matters whether Coinbase and Bitpay run an SPV wallet or software which validates and relays blocks. 

To the network qua the Bitcoin network, it generally does not. It may help indirectly under some remote circumstance and it could be much more useful in the future, but not no.

You dont need a monopoly to be protected from fraud, all people have recourse against being defrauded. 

If bcash was consensus fork it would have simply taken over the name and there would be no other ""bitcoin""  to confuse. If bcash could compete on merit, then would choose a clearly separate name like all other alts which forked off have done. (such a litecoin) 

Picking an intentionally confusing names such as ""Bitcoin cryptocurrency"" ""Bitcoin money"" ""Bitcoin cash"" are very close to fraud (enough that i think it counts) But outright mislabeling is simple fraud.

In polycentric ancap society, I suspect a much switfer punishment would have already been handed out. Or even better, an early warning from popular arbitrators about how they would rule on the case would have prevented wide proliferation of the counterfeit ""Bitcoin cash"" before any people were tricked.

"&gt; False; a different linux distro can run a computer. A alt crypto chain does not however satifsy a bitcoin debt.

That's one difference you've arbitrarily decided is the difference between fraud and not fraud. 

Debts in USD can't be settled in AUD, it doesn't mean selling something in dollars (AUD) is fraud.

It would only be fraud if you promised someone AUD and gave them USD, just like its fraud if you promise someone BTC and give them BCH. Unique currency identifiers exist precisely to avoid this kind of ""fraudulent"" confusion.

&gt;If I bought your car, but delivered you 10 oz of horse dung spray painted gold, you would have a legitimate fraud case. Its not about the trademark on the word ""gold"" at all, its about the intentional deception.

Gold alloys of many differing formulas can all be sold as ""gold"". Almost none of what is sold as gold is elemental gold. You can't settle a debt in 24 carat gold with 12 carat gold, that doesn't mean you're committing fraud for selling either as ""gold"". You can't sue someone for fraud because they sell ""gold"" as a slightly different alloy, unless they specified it was one particular type of gold and turned out to be another.

"I appreciate the time you took to create this post, and to some extent I even understand where your perspective comes from. That being said, I couldn't possibly disagree more. I've worked in the tech industry in multiple capacities, and have seen many innovations both succeed and fail.

Basically, crypto is new and any doubt that it is a big part of our future is a typical part of anything that is new and groundbreaking. To see where this is going requires 2 main things \- open mindedness and vision and a strong knowledge of disruptive technologies that have succeeded in the past \(know the history of tech\).  I can say with confidence that crypto is perhaps one of the most powerful technologies that have ever come our way in terms of how rapidly it is embedding itself in the very fabric of our society. 'Fads' do NOT get regulated by governments around the globe. The race for the first cryptocurrency that will be truly adopted is a crowded space and the growing efforts in this landscape is one of the MANY reasons crypto will thrive.

As for the charts, I am not sure what you're looking at. You seem to grasp that it is necessary to look through a broader lens to see the big picture, yet you did not acknowledge that Bitcoin has grown tremendously in the past 9 years and continues an upward trajectory.  Bitcoin now floats around $9\-10k, a year ago $1.5k, 2 years ago $400, 3 years ago $240, etc. Please don't just focus on that one spike of 2017. That was just a blip on its way to the top. Bitcoin alone has immense value and that value increases as more people get involved and the network becomes more secure. 

Bitcoin is 9 years old but still only in its infancy. It's already embedded itself as a proven, secure store of value with a limited supply. Demand is increasing year over year, and the number of new investors jumping on board will drive it to unimaginable prices and well beyond. And of course then there's this entire new generation of investors that were raised on technology \- their investment vehicle of choice is cryptocurrencies, which is not surprising as it suits their digital culture.


One last point... crypto is probably one of the most robust things to ever have come along. No matter the bad news, regulations, FUD articles and negativity, it just keeps coming back with greater ath's. The attacks that Bitcoin and crypto in general survived would criple the largest corporations on the planet. Yet here we are. And I have not even mentioned the countless innovative ways many of these projects plan to change the way we exchange, pay for and store data. Buckle up, because this ride has only just begun.

&gt;Cryptocurrencies aren't meant to be used that way

Whos to say? Its free, instant, and coinbase has been reliable since 2011. If me and my friends want to use bitcoin using coinbase, does it transfer value? Are we using USD?

Coinbase is only an app that is very popular. Are we not supposed to use technology? Everyone needs to run a bitcoin node just to use bitcoin?

So I think it should be in the best interest of the BCH community to proactively investigate whether there's prior art on some of those patents.

What stops the distributor buying 0.001 BTC and sending it to private key 'A' that generates address 'B'.

Now simply copy and paste address 'B' on 1000 notes.  (Clearly it might be best to have more than 1x 0.0001btc to pull this scam off but none-the-less the point remains)


People using these notes therefore have to trust two things.

* The note printer hasn't duplicated any

* The note printer hasn't kept the private keys (or seed) somewhere that they can later just pull all the funds from those notes.


It can happen if the distributor is trustworthy or has years of history showing they are trustworthy but this will take a long time.

"Well - the idea of investing in crypto's is that you invest in something you hope will reach mainstream adoption right, and get first mover advantage once normies start using it.

What do you reckon has the bigger potential for getting alot of people to use it actively?  Something with lots of people already invested in it, talking about it, hyped about it, maintaining market liquidity and volume ... or something that have a reddit sub full of hostile people bickering about how 'great the tech is' and disappointed that their 'quality project' never pumps whilst not really having a high volume causing it to be extremely easy to manipulate, and have much fewer people actually talking about it in laymans terms in the real world.  And for everyone who wants to learn something about what it can do for them, they're told to 'dyor' by those same hostile people?

Idk why most people in this sub have this crazy misconception that 'amazing tech' and 'such original' projects naturally will succeed, get mainstream adoption and make them rich.  Most normies don't give a flying fuck about tech, in fact they'd rather hear as little about the inner workings of a product as possible - as for originality, look towards history. Apple didn't make the first smartphone, Google didn't make the first search engine, FaceBook didn't make the first social network, there is no original ideas...

Mainstream adoption isn't driven by 'superior tech' and 'original ideas', mainstream adoption is driven by UX, marketing and hype.  The successful blockchain and crypto projects 5-10 years down the line wont be those with the greatest tech, it will be those who managed to create a seamless user experience making it simple and easy for normies to use their product, and normies wont give a shit if 90% of that product was derived from another project. It will be whoever manages to hype up their product, and market it in such a way that normies get excited about it. And normies wont give a shit about whether or not there are other projects with 'superior tech'.  That stuff is only interesting to us nerds.

I don't think you guys who keep criticizing projects for the 'hype' around them realise the fact that you're actually shilling said project.  If a project is able to generate hype from next to nothing, or a CEO's social media presence gives his project a shitload of exposure - that's actually a great thing, not a bad thing.  Why?

I disagree with you, because of what you said here:

&gt;The difference between hashing and not hashing is for in the context of thee businesses you mention usually pretty small.

This is not complete. There is another thing running software such as BitcoinABC or Bitcoin Core does which is super important: RELAY BLOCKS.

Why is that important? It's because the relaying of blocks is what makes the network the network. The reason there is a difference between **Bitcoin Cash** and **Bitcoin Core** is because the Bitcoin Cash network will accept blocks 8MB in size. Anybody running Bitcoin Core will reject 8MB blocks if the coin purports to be ""BTC"". If Coinbase only ran an ""advanced SPV"" whatever you call it which didn't care about validating or relaying blocks then their software would **accept 8MB block transactions for BTC.**

That's the true defining line between what makes a node a node or not. Whether or not it can tell the difference between what is or isn't valid according to the protocol, and react appropriately.",1525443428

"I agree with you, but I'm still a Bitcoin Cash supporter.  Before I start, I want to applaud you for this post.  The reality is that these points have all been debated by intellectual people, and by many are still considered acceptable for modern day hardware.  But I'll reiterate some my responses to your points on the off chance someone else can prove something I'm not already aware of.

In Order:

&gt; 1. Block propagation latency (causing centralization of mining)

32 MB on my (what I consider average) consumer-grade internet connection, 32MB took me 15.226 seconds to download.
Try it yourself: ```time wget http://mirror.filearena.net/pub/speed/SpeedTest_32MB.dat```
If you're a miner, and you think 15s is too expensive of a delay for you, then fortunately we have any of these (and more) options where we can improve propagation: https://gist.github.com/gavinandresen/e20c3b5a1d4b97f79ac2

Here's an issue you HAVEN'T mentioned, which is time to validate blocks that are 32MB in size.  During my recent benchmark of Bitcoin-ABC (which could be much more scientific other than just issuing print statements), it was validating 4.2k+ transactions per second (on my laptop, not a server) with signatures enabled.  Each Tx is about 256 bytes, so that's about 131k transactions in a 32MB block. It takes ~31 seconds to validate the whole block assuming we do it the ""dumb"" way, which is ignoring that we've validated most of those transactions already and likely have them in our mempool.

So, if we're completely inefficient, we can receive, validate, and start mining on a new block within 46 seconds of a new block being mined.  Which to be fair: is NOT a negligible amount of time!  It's basically giving the previous miner a 7.5% head start.  But as I was explaining already: this is if we're incredibly inefficient about this process (aka, not broadcasting the new block headers, the mined Tx hashes by bloom filters, and re-validating transactions that already passed the signature verification in our mempool).  These solutions are all real solution, and is enough for me to feel confident in calling this theory debunked--32MB blocks are 100% doable today.

&gt; 2. UTXO bloat (increases CPU and more RAM costs)

You'll have to explain what your point here even is... I can assume that maybe it's just needing to increase our UTXO cache (""dbcache"" setting), but that's 100% configurable... so that seems like a silly argument, so I'll assume it's not that.  Maybe you're referring to just the CPU/RAM usage of having to validate 218tx/s (= [32MB] / [256b/tx] / [10min])), but even the current implementation in its current configuration is validating 4k+/s... (again, on my laptop).. So I currently can't really fathom your point here.

&gt; 3. Bandwidth costs https://iancoleman.github.io/blocksize/#_

I played with your calculator.  The numbers didn't seem unreasonable--I don't know where they're getting some of there numbers, but sure--I'll assume that they're true even though they may be off.  With my cheap consumer ISP settings, my bandwidth usage is like 20%... Which leads me to say: ""...so?"".  I can run a non-validating node at home if I felt inclined to do that.  My servers in my data center hosting that much traffic costs me less than $100/year... If I'm a mining pool, I consider that quite negligible.  Let me know if I'm simply missing something here.

&gt; 4. IBD (Initial Block Download ) Boostrapping new node costs

This problem is already solved today.  Check out [the Bitcoin-ABC source code](https://github.com/Bitcoin-ABC/bitcoin-abc/blob/e1fa952678c607319cbb4f21abe14ff1b4eec826/src/validation.cpp#L1529-L1536).  Very old transactions don't have to be (but can be, if you wish) individually validated. The explanation why is there in a comment, but to rehash: *even if* an old Tx was invalid (which they're not), as long as the merkle trees and block headers match, there is nothing we could do about it, since we'd be forking on a chain that's had consensus for so very long--it'd be impossible for us to catch up.  By disabling these checks until the client reaches the ""assumedvalid"" block, the software cuts down on the synchronization time substantially (again: signature checking is really the only ""expensive"" part which can be skipped for old Txs).

&gt; 5. Blockchain storage (largely mitigated by pruning but some full archival nodes still need to exist in a decentralized manner)

You already kind of answered this problem in your point: sure, we can prune if you're a consumer-grade node.  But mining nodes probably shouldn't, and don't really have to.  Space is cheap.  It's the cheapest resource we have at the moment, which is the point of this post you're commenting in.


Anyway, these are my opinion on these problems.  It's also why I am convinced Bitcoin Cash is the most favorable solution.  Feel free to form your own opinions.  But it's important you know that your issues haven't already been debated, mitigated, and/or outright solved.

"Imagine you, Alice, being able to transfer your coins to Bob, without knowing or trusting Bob, but getting a guarantee that if he takes those coins, he will release the same amount of coins, in an *entirely* different transaction, to you. By entirely different I mean, no connection on the blockchain.
This can be done using hashes, but it's tricky, if you want to do it privately - if the hash is part of the Bitcoin Script in the transaction, then anyone can see that these two supposedly disconnected transactions use the same hash. There's ways round this, but not perfect - except ""scriptless scripts"", which makes it so there's no hash ever shown in the script - the secret number is *embedded* in the signature, so no one can ever see it (it's not just hard, it's impossible).

This paper is a further tweak - because what I described above as ""scriptless scripts"" can only be done with Schnorr signatures, which are not yet available in Bitcoin. The paper finds a way to do it in ECDSA, which is what Bitcoin uses. It's more complicated but the complication doesn't occur on the blockchain, which is great if it can be made to work in practice.",1525443044
"**Merkle tree**

In cryptography and computer science, a hash tree or Merkle tree is a tree in which every leaf node is labelled with the hash of a data block and every non-leaf node is labelled with the cryptographic hash of the labels of its child nodes. Hash trees allow efficient and secure verification of the contents of large data structures. Hash trees are a generalization of hash lists and hash chains.

Demonstrating that a leaf node is a part of a given binary hash tree requires computing a number of hashes proportional to the logarithm of the number of leaf nodes of the tree; this contrasts with hash lists, where the number is proportional to the number of leaf nodes itself.

My main takeaway / speculation from the video is that the IF wants to present traditional financial markets with a simple gateway to crypto goodness like trustless smart contracts, probably via an oracle IXI module. Seamless IOTA/fiat integration for us cryptognats isn't the point, it's seamless enabling of banks to use the new tech. That's a million times bigger market.

2.)

"Which is what will create an incentive to just raid the bank and switch to a new more profitable more speculative coin.

There are many people saying it doesn't matter if there aren't a lot of bitcoin transactions, because bitcoin is a store of value, it doesn't have to be a currency.

Well how do you convince people to pay millions of dollars to secure the network if they're only getting paid a percentage of transactions on something not a lot of people are transacting?

This is the problem of the reward structure designed only to encourage early adoption and not late adoption. The same people who were attracted by 1000% returns on investment are not going to hang around making .5% on transaction fees if they can switch to some new coin and get 1000% again.

"&gt;However, its true that the average user of bitcoin has very little say in this and it will only become worse the more bitcoin is adopted.

This is pretty much my point.

The theoretical ability of anyone to be a node and control what happens with bitcoin doesn't matter compared to the practical reality that the vast majority of users don't run nodes and aren't going to for practical reasons, and the forks people will end up going with will depend greatly on the decisions of a small number of disproportionately influential actors: mining pools, exchanges, and development teams.

1) Then Ver and WU are constantly shitting on Bitcoin. 

2) Ver and Wu are good friends and both pretty much have infinite money. Way too rich people tend to become a little weird. They crave more power. Did you know Roger wants to create his own country? I don't know, but if you ask me, we're dealing with a little vanity. 

3) And then you simply think about what the longter implications are for Blocksize increases. It means centralization, because average Joe will have even higher barriers to entry to mining. Blocksize increases  does not allow for off-chain solutions. Adding Segwit decreases miner fee, because of how block weight works and miners don't think that's cool. 


Whereas in BCH you have Blockincreases, they're at 32MB soon. Not only that, but they are also operating under temporary fee increases, essentially creating free Bitcoin at times.

Suddenly that shit makes sense. Of course they can burn money, when they get it back for free backend, and also of course via the coin pumping in value and making it attractive to other people. Why are they burning Bitcoin? 


Antpool is Bitmain and Bitmain is Jihan Wu, so there's that. Antpool is big in Bitcoin too, they're not burning coins there to pump the price are they? 


Then you have all these disgusting things Ver does to promote BCH. Then you have Faketoshi repping the coin - where it's been clearly proven already that he's not Satoshi. But he's good buds with Ver still, because he's an asset to Ver, because it aligns with the ""Satoshi vision"" bullshit. 


Satoshi fucked off with millions of Bitcoin being left in question. How is that supposed to work for a world currency exactly? One dude controlling massive amounts all by himself and might eventually dump the market?

The calculations have been done, but for some things which are more social and economic we are in uncharted territory. We can theorise as much as when can, but at some point you have to flip the switch.

UTXO commitments aren't ready yet - but I don't think there is any major disagreement that they would make IBD much faster, and I don't think there is any unsolved issues with doing it - I think there just isn't motivation to do them yet with everything else going on.

Agreed on the fundamental different approaches. It will be interesting to see how it all plays out over the next few years for sure.

&gt; Bitcoin users don't want to risk the whole project, even if it means that fees will be high.

What I don't think the proponents of that strategy realise, or take seriously, is that there are competing system - if they play it too safe they are risking the whole project - it will becoming obsolete. To me that is a bigger risk that increasing the block size.

It seems you are under the impression that the Bitcoin community (users and developers) promised to miners that a x2 HF would follow. That is not what happened. A few men in suits signed the NYA, and the community has very clearly opposed it. This was abundantly clear when SWSF activated.

It's a meritocracy. Anyone can have their voice heard in the development process, assuming they have previously worked to prove that their voice is valuable. That's how open-source projects work.

&gt; The user experience is very important

Yes, it is. And the principal values and ideology of Bitcoin are even more important, otherwise what the heck are we doing here. User experience and utility will follow.

There's not much more I can say without bashing BCH, which I find no reason to do. I recognize that some people prefer it and they can enjoy it if they want. The only thing I take a stand on is the issue of brand confusion, which will need to be sorted out at some point.

Basically, Bitcoin is a natural resource and various utilities will compete on available blockspace, for eternity.

Today something like memo.cash is novel, but chances are other more valuable use-cases will end up pricing it out; same goes for lightning network on-chain settlement because eventually it will be priced out of absolutely any blocksize, let alone a 1mb block.

Two things (these interpretations are my own):

1. It's [illegal to transact in Indonesia](http://www.allenovery.com/publications/en-gb/Pages/New-Indonesian-currency-law---Client-update.aspx) with anything other than Rupiah. There are exceptions (see link). You could argue that paying a vendor in BTC is the same as paying with a foreign credit card (which is allowed), except that...

2. Bank Indonesia (a.k.a. The Central Bank) [""has issued new regulations that bar fintech companies from using cryptocurrencies on their platforms""](https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2017/12/125620-bank-indonesia-bar-fintech-companies-using-digital-currency-platforms-2018/) ([official statement](https://www.bi.go.id/id/ruang-media/siaran-pers/Pages/sp_199317.aspx)). That regulation is for FinTech, but I imagine interpretation is similar to the ""security vs utility token"" discussion happening elsewhere. I'd argue that this is just a clarification from Bank Indonesia, saying ""yes, paying in crypto is in fact paying in something that is not IDR, which has been illegal for a while.""

"&gt; That's the plan

Really? Where can I read more about this? I'm not talking about some sterile testnet. I'm talking live.

&gt; Welcome to engineering.

So, if you're actually going to test this, staying in the engineering jargon, you're actually built the bridge already and opened it for traffic... before actually checking the calculations.

&gt; Checkpoints have been in Core for a long time

What I meant was actually UTXO commitments - you can always skip validating with a flag in the command line. Also checkpoints are mostly to keep an immensely powerful miner from starting from the genesis block and simply rewrite the whole chain, as I understand it.

&gt; So we don't end up crippling the network with massive fees and drive potential users and innovatotors to other solutions. 

See, this is probably where the two camps have a fundamental different approach. Bitcoin users don't want to risk the whole project, even if it means that fees will be high. Here the decentralization of the network weighs higher than low fees. You think the balance should be another place, thats fine. You got a coin for that now, but the majority of bitcoin users actually want the scaling first, increase blocksize after approach.

&gt; See BTCs market cap dominance decrease

BTC market dominance has nothing to do with this. Bitcoin price is, imo 99% driven by speculation - ie. buy now, double by tomorrow, and it was its speculative aspect that has driven the price. People realized altcoins could also do this, and moved even fasters. 

&gt; loss of key merchants, developers moving to alts

merchants come and go, same with devs.

"&gt; Its fine if you believe these are not problems, and bcash easily can handle 32 mb - but then I urge you to demonstrate it. Fill the blocks halfway and keep that up... Forever...

That's the plan, we can analyse the results, resolve problems and then it'll be increased further if needs be. Welcome to engineering.

&gt; solutions that have not even been implemented, like checkpoints

Checkpoints have been in Core for a long time (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/chainparams.cpp#L154) and it by default since 0.14 wont validate transactions before those checkpoints, making IBD much faster. See https://bitcoincore.org/en/2017/03/08/release-0.14.0/#assumed-valid-blocks

&gt; why increase blcksize before these problems are actually solved

So we don't end up crippling the network with massive fees and drive potential users and innovatotors to other solutions. See BTCs market cap dominance decrease, loss of key merchants, developers moving to alts and community being torn apart.

It's difficult to mistake Bitcoin from Bitcoin Cash, specially when buying from markets. Both symbols and values are different. Don't take me wrong but no, I was never that n00b. Maybe that's because I have been here since the very beginning and the only wallet I have ever used was the Bitcoin core wallet. But that's just me...

I understand your point of view, but honestly, this is not a child's game. Maybe it's a place where child's should not be present. The fact that the very own crypto ecosystem is embedded into the internet, makes it of easy access to little kids who see it as a game.

To me, that is the problem. Buying and selling crypto should not be that easy. There should be a maturity barrier so that those involved, know what the stakes are.

Don't take me wrong, but honestly... I find it very difficult for me to mistakenly buy Bitcoin Cash instead of Bitcoin. 

If someone commits that mistake, that someone needs to stop, learn a bit more about cryptos and then yeah, invest in them. Committing such mistake reveals lack of maturity in investing into the crypto market. It means the person doesn't really know what is doing...",1525431548

"I'm not arguing that the context you provide doesn't absolutely dwarf the current state of affairs when going back to the peaks of the recent bubble, just that the peak during that period (200k+) is an awfully high bar to set. At what number of unconfirmed transactions does this become unreasonable? Surely somewhere far below that.

Working with companies attempting to allow Bitcoin payments in 2012/2013/2014 I'm pretty sure the 3000+ number put us in damage control mode which was a customer support disaster (and was during the bubble(s) of that period) since some non-trivial number of those ""stuck"" transactions would be legitimate customers. There's no way any of those old companies could operate the way things are now.

I've been on the other end of the stick when people would claim spam attacks on the network in those bubble periods... I've seen firsthand a good portion of those ""spam"" attacks were just those customers trying to use their magic internet money someone talked them into buying and had no intricate knowledge into how wallets or fees or mining worked (a workable understanding of cash and credit cards is a much more reasonable endeavor for the average person at the point all that becomes a problem for the end-user). So many turned off Bitcoin acceptance back then, and I have no doubt integrations are on their way back out today since things seem that much worse.

The Bitcoin today is not what we bought into back then when it gets so congested that cash/card becomes a massively more practical alternative; Bitcoin has become a speculative store of value instead. We watch the undoing of so much effort over the past years working with customers and merchants (and selling them on the idea) to get them to use it. It's a disaster for those of us who put in all that effort boots on the ground all these years to watch all that undone. All of us ""true believers"" back then assumed with relatively high confidence it would be fixed quickly if we were able to get people and businesses to use it and apparently we were WAY off; rather than scaling as peer-to-peer cash the goal post was moved to store of value.

To be clear, I hope either Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash succeeds but my measure of success is solely rooted in utility for online payments for the average person. The ones that only know how to use Facebook and Amazon at best. Unconfirmed transaction count is a hard indicator of this being absolutely infeasible at this point in time. I don't care how many dollars a single unit is worth, that number is completely arbitrary and irrational at this point in time. By my measure, I hope anything Bitcoin-like succeeds as long as it's open-source, there is no hard-coded central authority behind it, the cryptography and game theory is solid (and well vetted), and it remains peer to peer. It would be hard to start efforts over with a new name though.

For the record, I have and have always had a coin-for-coin equal stake in what little I have remaining from the old days that I didn't completely liquidate in December/January. I'm just too tired to work on or with cryptocurrency any longer, with clients, customers, businesses, infrastructure, security, and code. I hope block size or lightning or whatever the fuck ends up being the fix soon so the end-user doesn't need to know anything about these interworkings even during high volume periods, but things have seemed so far gone and political for the past few years that life just seems too short for me to be personally invested any longer.",1525431131

Latest information from slack is that the smart contacts for Q will be more customizable and their oracle implementation (which I think is the IXI hub) should be game changing.

Two big factors for immediate adoption (I think):

1. Are q smart contracts (crypto kitty proof) ready for real world use 
(Iota has said they are working with another industry leading partner with Q. So it might be.)

2. How many bitcoin/Eth miners they can convince to leave and join their machine learning network (Cogniota)

Unfortunately however, after a short pump people will most likely dump eventually because of the coordinator.

Lastly, I believe iota is in a prime position in the iot space to gather the data necessary to enable smart contacts (Oracles right?) for everyday use. Because they have invested time and effort into data gathering sensors (ruuvi and Match X) and techniques.

Hope this helps.

You're also referencing an event that happened 100 years ago.  So what is it, a 1 in 100 year event? 1 in 500?  Giving up the benefits of state sponsored fiat currencies to protect against that rare of an event is foolish.  That's like somebody who earns $30,000/year spending $100,000 on ""prepping"".

Nope, they simply called these critics traitors and banned from the community. Not to mention that the project itself was trolled out of Bitcoin Core, resulting in the creation of Bitcoin XT.

All in all, it certainly looks like someone wanted to shape the development themselves rather than relying on the governance of the masses. Maybe for not malicious reasons but simple arrogance? Anyway, seeds of this were planted before Blockstream was a thing, so you have a point there.

"&gt; Now imagine some upstart devs forked off and reduced block size to 1mb, heavily restricting transactional capacity to create a fluctuating fee market intended to produce long term fees in excess of $100+

"&gt; has probably already secretly edited the blockchain to put many of the millions of unclaimed coins into wallets they control. this is only possible if a single entity achieves more than 50% control of the blockchain for even an instant - which should never even come close to happening - but it already did.

This is nonsense. There is no way to secretly edit the blockchain, because the entire blockchain is public. What a 51%+ share of the hashrate allows you to do is completely prevent other miners from contributing and/or select which transactions you allow into the blockchain.

Those actions only apply to future blocks and transactions and they're pretty easy to spot, so we'd know if Bitmain started doing it.

Having &gt;50% of the hashrate for a longer period of time allows you to, theoretically, undo past transactions and/or blocks. The further back you want to go, the more effort it takes. However, this process requires you to mine on a private copy of the blockchain (forked from the current chain at some earlier point) until your fork becomes longer than the active chain at which point you broadcast your longer fork.

Such an action would also be immediately recognizable, since it requires you to pull all your hashrate out of the main chain, causing blatantly obvious drop. And it still only allows you to undo past transactions, not steal coins.

In order to steal coins from wallets, an attacker has to create transactions that are invalid to all other nodes. Other participants in the network would immediately notice it if this would happen.

Any attempt to exploit a 51% attack would likely result in a large and permanent loss of confidence in Bitcoin, plummeting the price. Since commercial miners have there revenues depending on the Bitcoin price, it would likely be business suicide to do this (this doesn't apply to state actors that are out to kill Bitcoin).

51% attacks are a serious concern, but the doomsday scenario you've outlined is completely wrong. Even with a majority hashrate, what you're able to do is very limited. And more importantly: any hostile action would be visible to other participants, meaning you only get 1 shot at doing something.",1525428253

The tangle does work without it, but as with a lot of crypto currencies, the tangle would be vulnerable to a 51% attack. Until use has increased, the coordinator takes up the slack and keeps the tangle safe.

As for the Curl function, I think the IF handled the situation rather clumsily, but ultimately the seed (private key) was needed to cause collisions which was the flaw found. So if you have another user's seed, the security issue that *only arises* if you have the seed is moot. They moved away from Curl now.

"I'll reply to your replies in order :

By saying that security increases by 0 or even goes down, on effect of a malicious transactor adding incorrect validation : a) I don't know how you'd actively CHOOSE which transactions you validate, in order for you to fool the network. b) Even if you could, you'd still have valid transactors trying to validate your malicious transactions. So in a network with very high throughput, fighting that becomes infeasible.

I agree it's ""convenient"", but it also makes complete sense to me. If there's no transactions, people could just do whatever they want. If there's millions a seconds, good luck generating millions of your own per second required to fool the network, when there's no coordinator.
I'd also like to add that either a) businesses don't care about decentralisation, or b) they have full understanding and faith in how IOTA will do it. Otherwise they wouldn't invest so much effort and trust into them. Also investors don't care (see EOS - they haven't even made their centralised system yet and are worth more than nearly every crypto).

You're saying that people will use a system that doesn't validate, because by not validating you'll have to resent your transaction? Then your transaction would never get through as you'd forever retry until you validate others? Again, I don't see how you're able to send a transaction on the protocol, without using the protocol and therefore having to validate other transactions.",1525426063

I've spent many hours pondering this late at night, and I think the only way you could get around needing to confirm on the BTC (or whatever) blockchain would be if you could somehow securely transfer ownership of the private key of a special wallet, but that seems impossible. What you could _maybe_ do, somehow, is use IOTA as a second layer for BTC, where you use an oracle to watch the BTC network and send transactions back and forth over IOTA, which either party could settle on the real blockchain if they wanted.

Would you bet on red at the casino if red was 50% but would pay 10x but had to wait 10 years for the result and could only participate once? Sure, you can lose your bet, but still, sounds like a smart bet to me if you can manage the risk. ",1525422986

I don't really know anything about how oracles in IOTA will work, but I can tell you for sure that you can't use them to truly send BTC directly.

"Let's see if I understand this.

Bitcoin Core supporters believe that large blocks and low fees lead inexorably to centralization, which leads inexorably to censorship and corruption.

Therefore the solution is to demand that miners adhere to a strict 1MB+Segwit block size limit so that everyone can run a fully-validating node; and to move ""normal / everyday"" transactions to a 2nd layer ""Lightning Network"" where onchain transactions are rarely if ever needed.

However the block size limit then creates an incentive^1 to ""spam"" the blockchain to fill up blocks to the block size limit, creating high fees and backlogs.

Now we learn (which we already understood) that under these conditions, Lightning Network fails under conditions of always-full blocks and unpredictable fees.

BCH PLS

^1 the incentive is twofold.  First, miners have an incentive to exploit the capacity limit like a cartel to raise fees for everyone.  Second, all competing altcoins and the legacy banking system have an interest in Bitcoin's failure or retarding its adoption.",1525422383

This means that IoT is using old generation smart phone cpus, not bleeding edge custom hardware architectures. ML is now starting to push into hardware, and I could see crypto doing the same. It already has for mining, obviously, but I could imagine something like a specialized subprocessor for hashing in a smartphone or IoT device, but it's just such a huge gamble building it in ternary when IOTA is the only thing that it would natively support. It requires you to bet heavily on one coin, when I'm sure there will be competitors.

Yes, strictly speaking. But don't get me wrong, this doesn't mean that there is no value to what they are running or that they should necessarily downgrade. Their particular advanced SPVs may be needed for their own operations or may provide useful function as archival nodes.

1. Bitcoin actually HAS inherent value, unlike FIAT money. FIAT money is issued depending on what the central banks think is needed to stabilize our wholey monetary system. It is not limited. And there is no inherent value to be found in cash. It is simply the trust and consensus in our society that we decide that on.

However, Bitcoin is not just limited in supply, it is also expensive to ""produce"" What are the costs for mining 1 bitcoin? like 2000 dollars? That could be seen as inherent value. 

2. Bitcoin is used by criminals? Jesus christ. There are legit statistics from governments(!) tell us that like 4% of illicit activities are paid in cryptocurrencies. Guess what is the rest: Cash, predominantly.

Nothing is as anonym and intransparent as cash.
Now, from the 4% I would imagine only a small portion is actually Bitcoin and the rest is private shit like Monero and ZCash. Bitcoin is amazing for the authorities. It's transparent. ",1525421083

"&gt;That to me implies a linear growth of security in that situation, but I'm happy to be shown to be wrong. 

I don't think that's correct because the attacker can itself add validations, which obviously grows the security by 0 (or even decreases it, since it might fool others to follow its tips), not linearly.

&gt;Pretty simple temporary fix.

Also pretty convenient, IOTA can just keep chugging along as a centralized cryptocurrency while claiming that it will work in a decentralized manner, never actually having to show it.

&gt;As far as I know, you can't just ""choose not to validate transactions"" that's part of the protocol. That's like saying you'll choose not to pay BTC fees when you send BTC.

The more accurate analogy is BTC miners not validating transactions, which they may also not due, at risk of producing an invalid block and losing their reward.

There's no mechanism to prove that you did validate something, in IOTA I think the worst that can happen to you if you don't validate transactions is that validating nodes will not build on top of an invalid tip you produced by accident, which doesn't seem like a big deal: you can just resubmit the transaction. That makes it more likely that people will use clients that do 0 validation, because they're more lightweight.

&gt;Genuine question, have you read the whitepaper?

I didn't, because it's famous for being long and obtuse/badly written. I have tried to understand it from other sources though, and so far I think a have a good enough grasp of how it works. These conversations help to clear up some of what I don't understand. ",1525418904

"&gt; All you need to know about github: Try making an addition that goes against the Core narrative; Watch it fail.

This, I feel, is a major problem with Github that I hadn't considered before. I'm not too fond of being unable to know who is in control of an open source project. That's a level of transparency I feel should go hand-in-hand with open source. I think I'll post to their forum about that and see why it's not possible. I assume it's something to do with privacy and reducing spam towards those with admin access? But that's why spam filters exist :p

&gt; Technically, nothing, although the difference is this time we are aware of the dangers of unfree discussion. [...] You also have to remember even Satoshi said bitcoin or any system could not be immune to political problems, only that it would help possibly reduce things a bit.

I'd like to believe that with sufficient transparency and decentralization you can all but neutralize such risks. I really, really liked Gavin's implementation where after 51% use of his fork, it would be implemented. I'd love to see that be the norm, or some similar system where you don't have admins approving pull requests but a repository push system based on some form of community votes. Create a new branch, let those running nodes switch to it if they prefer, then after 51% of nodes are using that branch, it gets merged with master. For a little more transparency, make sure that all branches report their usage to a site that displays statistics on how many nodes are running each branch. Doesn't seem like it'd be *that* hard to implement with a few git hooks.

Granted, that puts all the power of pushes in the hands of those running nodes, and I'm not familiar enough with the ins and outs of crypto to know whether or not that's a bad idea. The only other automated system that ensures community input would be to allow votes, but web polls are notoriously hard to validate.

Anyways, thanks for the links :) I've got finals tomorrow, but I'm going to do a lot of reading up on crypto this weekend and aim to get a firmer grasp on all of this so that I can start understanding a lot more of the system and possibly contribute a little more.
